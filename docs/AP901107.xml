<TEXT>
   In this glamorous tax haven, money's playground by
the sea, the idle rich are making room for the busy, bustling rich.
   Aristocrats still risk fortunes at the Casino's velvet-covered
tables, but the 380-acre principality is catering to a new breed of
wealth and power.
   It seeks the working rich who may spend a week in Monaco, not
six months like the grand dukes of a century ago, to check on an
industrial investment, watch the Grand Prix or attend a business
convention.
   On a stroll through the Casino gardens, you're more likely to
meet carpet salesmen from Toronto than European royalty. Last year,
Monaco welcomed 50,000 convention-goers.
   Tourism now generates only one-fourth of the $5 billion gross
national product. Gambling, once the government's mainstay, brings
in only 4 percent.
   Banking accounts for 35 percent and light industry 27. Monaco
now has 50 banks, and more are coming.
   Prince Rainier, who has ruled since 1949, sought to preserve and
capitalize on Monaco's reputation for glamor when he called for
economic diversification.
   ``The government has put its money behind prestige and luxury,''
said a public relations officer for the principality. ``It used to
bank on the very rich. Today it has sought to develop a clientele
of the slightly less rich.''
   Hotel statistics are revealing. Monaco has 2,400 rooms, 80
percent in the luxury category going for $200 to $450. Fewer than
100 rooms cost less than $50.
   Officials try to keep industry and tourism apart. Hardly any of
the 3 million daytrippers who spilled from trains and buses last
year went near the industrial park on Fontvieille, a peninsula
reclaimed from the sea.
   Many of the Monaco's 700 industrial companies are there. Most
are in such high-tech, non-polluting fields as pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and engineering.
   A value added tax on the new commercial activities is the
largest source of revenue in Monaco's annual budget of $510
million.
   Fontvieille accommodates both factories and company
headquarters, stacked atop each other in skyscrapers. Nearby are a
new sports stadium, three-star hotel, heliport and Monaco's only
low-income housing.
   It was the brainchild of Prince Rainier, who saw the future of
his tiny realm in real estate. A forest of skyscrapers, eyesores to
many visitors, looms against a background of steep mountains,
dwarfing hillside villas built in the 19th century.
   Commercial or residential space in Monaco generally is more
expensive than in Paris and New York. A two-room apartment in
Fontvieille rents for $3,000 a month, and cheaper accommodations
are hard to find.
   Housing has become a major headache. The government gives
priority for state-owned housing and rent subsidies of up to 50
percent to the natives, called Monegasques, but demand exceeds
supply.
   Many apartments are owned by investors who spend little time in
them. At night, dark windows make patches on luxury high-rises.
   Nightlife revolves around a few expensive discotheques and
clubs, and cultural events geared to the wealthy establishment.
   Young residents complain of little to do. Monaco has only one
movie theater, no discount or department stores, no major shopping
center.
   There is virtually no unemployment, yet Monegasques - about
4,500 in a population of 27,000 - worry about the future.
   ``The problem is not finding jobs for young Monegasques, it's
finding jobs suited to their educational degrees and
qualifications,'' said Stephane Valeri, 28.
   He heads the Association of Young Monegasques, founded in 1986
to handle their employment and housing problems and help them start
businesses. Citizens now own less than 3 percent of commerce and
industry in Monaco, but Valeri said new opportunities were opening
in services and the law.
   ``We're very attached to our history, our traditions and to the
royal family,'' he said. ``We're just trying to make Monaco better
for the year 2000.''
   In addition to the myth that all are rich, which the government
tries to dispel, Monegasques have a reputation as poor workers.
   ``Some Monegasques ... adopt a superior attitude and feel they
can get away with anything because they know they can't be fired,''
a government spokesperson said, on condition of anonymity.
   The 5,000 Italians who cross the border each day to work in
hotels and restaurants envy the privileges of Monegasques,
including comprehensive health insurance, higher wages and the
first crack at vacant jobs.
   Residents of this fiscal paradise, except for French nationals
who have arrived since 1957, pay no taxes on income, capital gains
or on an inheritance if it comes directly from a parent or spouse.
   Security and respectability are basic tenets. The police force
has 400 members, who help tourists, direct traffic and discourage
purse-snatching and other crimes.
   ``Monaco is the type of place where you think twice about
dropping candy wrappers,'' said a retired Greek executive who has
lived here 35 years. ``You feel very safe and life is very calm.''
   A dress code confines bathing suits to the beach and forbids
going barefoot. Shorts are permitted, but men are not allowed to go
bare chested. Expulsion from Monaco is the punishment for
violations.
   Officials know the future depends on physical expansion. Besides
putting the train station underground, architects unveiled plans
last year for three floating islands with their own stores and
homes, connected to the mainland by bridges and ferries.
   ``It sounds like ... Jules Verne, but it's something I'm sure my
successors will have to deal with,'' said Jean-Louis Medecin, the
mayor.

<HEAD>Egypt's President Calls for Delay in Attacking Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday
that U.S.-led forces should wait ``at least two to three more
months'' to decide if the trade embargo will force Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait, a newspaper reported.
   In an interview published in The New York Times on Thursday,
Mubarak warned that if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein doesn't pull
his troops out of Kuwait, war will be inevitable.
   ``There will be no other way out,'' Mubarak told the Times. ``I
am not bluffing. I don't think the United States is bluffing. How
can Saddam Hussein make such a miscalculation of his situation? It
is very dangerous for him, very dangerous. I wonder how he cannot
realize that.''
   In an interview in Cairo, Mubarak said it is time for the United
Nations Security Council to approve a resolution authorizing the
use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait if diplomacy fails.
   ``The problem of Saddam Hussein is that he is one man against
the world and even against himself simply because he does not
realize the real danger around him,'' Mubarak said. ``And his
entourage is not briefing him.''

<HEAD>Red Cross Taking Heat for Handling of Disasters, Blood Supply</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In taking on the presidency of the American
Red Cross, Elizabeth Dole is moving to the helm of an organization
that has known controversy from the days of Clara Barton to the era
of AIDS and the Loma Prieta earthquake.
   She isn't likely to face criticism for living in a tent and
directing operations from the field, as Red Cross founder Barton
did, but she could end up having easily as many battles on her hand
as she did in President Bush's Cabinet.
   After a year in which it faced record disaster expenditures, the
organization has taken heat not only for its handling of such
emergencies but for its role as a supplier of blood for
transfusions.
   ``Elizabeth Dole has the stature and talent to revitalize the
national Rd Cross and make it the kind of modern helping force
necessary for disasters in the 1990's,'' San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos said when the outgoing labor secretary was named to the new
job.
   ``From our experience in the Loma Prieta earthquake, it is
needed,'' Agnos added.
   Others echoed his view.
   ``When the national Red Cross has become involved in the past,
there has been a letdown in coordination,'' said Carl Bradford,
director of emergency services for West Virginia. ``The Red Cross
seems to function very well at the local level, but when national
comes in they do not work as well with state and local
governments.''
   Carol McArthur, press secretary to Oakland, Calif., Mayor Lionel
Wilson, was so upset by the Red Cross' performance after the Oct.
17, 1989, earthquake in Northern California that she resigned from
the board of the organization's Oakland and East Bay chapter.
   ``The local Red Cross was very, very efficient, but they had
national representatives breathing down their necks,'' Ms. McArthur
said. ``Mainly the problems had to do with individuals not
understanding the varied needs of the ethnically diverse community
we have here.''
   Jim Cassell, a media associate at Red Cross headquarters, said
the organization is making a study of its disaster services, due
for completion in March.
   ``We will look at all disasters, including the major ones of
last year, the earthquake on the West Coast and Hurricane Hugo in
the East,'' Cassell said. He said the study was in large measure
``due to our own interest in always improving our services ... and
not just in response to criticism from outside.''
   Richard Smith, vice president and general manager at the
organization's Eastern operations headquarters in Alexandria, Va.,
said, ``We have learned a lot of lessons we can put into our
operational planning right away.''
   ``Mostly our need is to try to streamline our training,'' he
said. ``At a time when emotions and passions can run rather high,
and then you bring augmented resources in from outside, it is very
challenging to make sure you do that so that feelings don't get
rubbed in the wrong way. Some people have worse skills than others
in doing that and we sometimes have moments of tension.''
   ``We had a difficult year, but all that assessment is being put
to our improvement,'' said Smith.
   In a separate initiative, the Red Cross announced in August that
it was substituting centralized management for its system of local
control in each of 54 blood service regions, which supply blood to
more than half the hospitals in the United States.
   The action followed months of scrutiny by the news media and the
Food and Drug Administration. In 1988, the Red Cross acknowledged
it distributed 24 pints of blood that had failed AIDS procedures
but said none of the blood was used and none carried the AIDS
virus. The FDA said the units were shipped by Red Cross centers in
Washington and Nashville, Tenn.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said, ``The purpose of those
reforms is to help the Red Cross come into greater compliance with
our standards. We have an ongoing system of inspections, and so we
hope the improvements they are making will be reflected in those
inspections. We are very encouraged by the steps they are taking.''
   The American Red Cross is one of 150 national Red Cross and Red
Crescent societies affiliated with the International Committee of
the Red Cross, based in Geneva. In some countries, the society is
an arm of the government, but in the United States it is a private
organization supported by contributions.
   Congress gave the Red Cross a charter in 1918 to conduct
disaster preparedness and relief. There is no congressioal
oversight, however.
   The American Red Cross has around 2,700 chapters, a paid staff
of 25,000 and more than 1 million volunteers. In 1989, it received
a record $165 million in donations and spent $151 million, more
than tripling the previous record. Its national office is in
Washington. It has operational headquarters for the East Coast in
Alexandria, Va., for the Midwest in St. Louis and for the West in
Burlingame, Calif.
   Clara Barton, a former schoolteacher and government clerk who
became a superintendent of nurses during the Civil War, founded the
group as the American Association of the Red Cross in 1881 and
became its first president.
   ``She was always very much hands-on when a big disaster
struck,'' said James Perry, a National Park Service ranger at the
Clara Barton House in Glen Echo, Md. ``She would personally lead
the field operation.''
   During the Johnstown, Pa., flood of 1889, Miss Barton was in the
field for five months.
   Critics of her style of personal leadership forced her
resignation in 1904 at the age of 83.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, will become president in January. She succeeds
Richard Schubert, who resigned from the $185,000-a-year job more
than a year ago.
   Smith, whose first disaster experience with the Red Cross was in
the aftermath of Hurricane Camille in Louisiana in 1969, said the
role of the Red Cross has changed since it was chartered by
Congress in 1918.
   ``At that point, the federal agencies' role was much more in
dealing with public utilities and infrastructure and much less with
individual families, and so the Red Cross in those days took the
primary job even of rebuilding people's homes and long-term
recovery help,'' the Red Cross vice president said. ``As the
federal government expanded its role to be more that of long-term
recovery, the Red Cross withdrew from that and put more emphasis on
short-term emergency response.''
   Government disaster relief is now run by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, created during the Carter administration as a
consolidation of several programs.
   Peg Maloy, assistant associate director for public affairs at
FEMA, said, ``If the president signs a major disaster declaration,
we become the coordinator. We also then give disaster money and
temporary housing to the Red Cross for some of the work that they
do. We have a memorandum of understanding with the Red Cross. We
also sit on their national board.''

   Former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. on
Tuesday became the first third-party candidate to win the
Connecticut governor's office in 134 years. Gary Franks, a black
Republican, was elected to the U.S. House.
   No black Republican has represented a U.S. House district since
1935.
   With 85 percent of precincts reporting, Weicker, running as an
independent, had 379,335 votes, or 41 percent, to 337,173 votes, or
36 percent, for his nearest challenger, Republican John G. Rowland,
a three-term congressman from blue-collar Waterbury.
   Democrat Bruce A. Morrison, a four-term congressman from the New
Haven suburb of Hamden, had 195,137 votes, or 21 percent.
   Franks, one of three black Republicans running for Congress this
year, won Rowland's 5th District seat over former U.S. Rep. Toby
Moffett.
   With 93 percent of the precincts reporting, Franks had 90,084
votes, or 52 percent, to Moffett's 81,906 votes, or 47 percent.
   The state's voters had grown accustomed to electing Democratic
governors over the past three decades. No third-party candidate had
won the office since 1856.
   But Weicker, a Republican defeated in a 1988 re-election bid,
roared back onto Connecticut's political scene in March, announcing
he would run for governor as an independent and promising ``a hell
of a race.''

   Georgia's lone Republican congressman, Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, fell behind in the ballot counting Tuesday in a
close race that overshadowed the election of Democrat Zell Miller
as governor.
   With 76 percent of precincts reporting in the 6th Congressional
District, Gingrich had 53,147 votes, or 50 percent, to 54,034
votes, or 50 percent, for Democrat David Worley, a Jonesboro
lawyer.
   Gingrich, a diehard tax cutter, led the pack of conservatives
who bucked President Bush's original deficit-reduction compromise
with the Democratic leadership in Congress.
   Miller, the lieutenant governor for 16 years, rode voter
enthusiasm over a state lottery to victory in the governor's race.
   With 88 percent of precincts reporting, Miller had 633,710
votes, or 54 percent, to 503,115 votes, or 43 percent, for
Republican Johnny Isakson, a prosperous Atlanta real estate company
executive and state legislator for 14 years.
   Miller had been a heavy favorite to keep the governor's office
in Democratic hands. The incumbent, Joe Frank Harris, leaves office
in January after the state limit of two consecutive terms.
   The state's 10 members of the U.S. House, nine Democrats and a
Republican, all faced opposition Tuesday. Sen. Sam Nunn, a
Democrat, had no opposition.
   Miller, 58, defeated four opponents, including former Mayor
Andrew Young in an Aug. 7 runoff, to win the Democratic nomination
for governor.
   Young since has campaigned for Miller but has said he may try
again in four years to become the state's first black governor.
Miller has said he will retire after serving a single four-year
term.
   Isakson, 45, sought to neutralize the lottery as an issue by
endorsing the proposal, himself, while differing with Miller on how
the revenue should be used to enhance education.

   Democrat Ann Richards squelched millionaire
Republican oilman Clayton Williams in Tuesday's gubernatorial race,
a contest that set records for spending and mudslinging.
   Outspent by nearly 2-1 margin, Ms. Richards nonetheless closed
the gap with Williams in the campaign's final days, helped by his
admission last week that he had paid no taxes in 1986.
   With 67 percent of precincts reporting, Richards had 1,286,455
votes, or 52 percent, to 1,1176,405 votes, or 48 percent, for
Williams.
   Texas voters gave Republican Phil Gramm a second term in the
U.S. Senate. With 67 percent of precincts reporting, Gramm had
1,459,815 votes, or 60 percent, to 982,579 votes, or 40 percent,
for his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Hugh Parmer of Fort Worth.
   With Democrats holding 19 of the state's 27 seats in the U.S.
House, the GOP concentrated on unseating Democratic Rep. Bill
Sarpalius of Amarillo.
   Republican challenger Dick Waterfield, a two-term state
legislator, got all the help he could hope for from the party's big
guns, including appearances by first lady Barbara Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and Gramm.

   Bernard Sanders on Tuesday pushed Rep.
Peter Smith out of the state's lone House seat to become the first
socialist in Congress in more than 60 years.
   With 73 percent of the precincts reporting, the former mayor of
Burlington had 71,119 votes, or 56 percent, to 51,273 votes, or 40
percent for Smith, a Republican. Sanders ran as an independent.
   In the governor's race, former Gov. Richard Snelling grabbed
back the office, overcoming competition from Democrat Peter Welch,
former president pro tem of the state Senate.
   With 73 percent of precincts reporting, Snelling had 66,642
votes, or 52 percent, to Welch's 59,388 votes, or 46 percent.
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Democrat who succeeded Snelling in
office in 1985, opted not to seek a fourth term.
   Snelling had decided to run when it still appeared that Kunin
would seek re-election. He said he entered the race because he felt
the state's fiscal affairs were a mess.

   William J. Bennett, who crafted the strategy
for the Bush administration's war on drugs, will resign within a
week, an administration source said Tuesday night.
   Bennett, 47, feels he has completed the task of designing a
strategy for the drug war and that it is working, said the source.
   This source said personal reasons, including safety concerns for
himself and his family, also played a part in his decision to
resign as director of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy.
   The Washington Post reported on the resignation in Wednesday's
editions.
   The White House has scheduled a ceremony to announce the
resignation, and that ``could possibly be before Friday,'' said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   No one has yet been tapped to replace Bennett, the source said.
   The source denied that Bennett was leaving because of boredom,
even though Bennett has seemed testy in recent months over the
relative lack of public interest in drug problems as the Persian
Gulf and economic woes took center stage.
   ``It's not boredom,'' the source said. ``He set out to do a
task. He's done it, and he's seeing the fruition of it. Now he's
going on to the next phase of his life.''
   Bennett does not have another job lined up, the source said.
   The personal reasons and security concerns have become
increasingly important in the past few weeks, according to the
source.
   ``There's been some threats, bomb threats, personal threats,''
the source said. On a recent swing through Alaska, where he
campaigned for a ballot measure to re-criminalize marijuana, a
third bodyguard was assigned to Bennett.
   The concerns, said the source, ``Have been building. I've seen
it start to eat away at him.''
   Bennett and his wife have two young sons.
   President Bush joined Bennett in September to mark the one-year
anniversary of the drug strategy and to call attention to signs
that the cocaine crisis appears to be abating. Such signs include
higher prices and lower purity, slightly fewer emergency room cases
involving cocaine, and surveys showing Americans of all ages
turning against illegal drugs of all kinds.
   Bennett's job was created by Congress in 1988 to coordinate the
efforts of several dozen federal agencies involved in the war on
drugs. Congress created the post as a Cabinet-level job, but Bush
decided not to include Bennett in his Cabinet, and Bennett said he
did not mind.

<HEAD>Democrat Andrus Wins Unprecedented Fourth Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus earned an
unprecedented fourth four-year term Tuesday, just seven months
after he was targeted for defeat by outraged anti-abortion forces.
   Andrus, who interrupted his tenure as governor to serve as Jimmy
Carter's interior secretary, was never really tested in the
campaign by Roger Fairchild, a former state Senate Republican floor
leader.
   With 18 percent of precincts reporting, Andrus had 23,383 votes,
or 61 percent, to 14,934 votes, or 39 percent, for Fairchild.
   Idaho voters maintained their ticket-splitting tradition,
re-electing five-term Republican Rep. Larry Craig, who defeated
Democrat Ron Twilegar for the seat of retiring GOP Sen. James
McClure.
   Republicans have held the seat for 40 years. Craig spent $1.5
million, three times more than Twilegar, to keep it that way.
   With 17 percent of precincts reporting, Craig had 24,192 votes,
or 66 percent, to 12,680 votes, or 34 percent, for Twilegar.
   In the race to succeed Craig in the House, Republican state Sen.
Skip Smyser was locked in a tight race with Democrat Larry LaRocco,
one-time aide to Sen. Frank Church.
   Fairchild, 37, a populist businessman, spent $90,000 of his own
money to win a lackluster three-way primary but was financially
hamstrung during the general election campaign. He barely raised
$50,000 against $1 million raised by Andrus, 59.
   Fairchild ran on an anti-abortion platform, reminding voters of
the governor's March 30 veto of what would have been the nation's
most restrictive abortion law.

   Television encountered the off-year elections
Tuesday night like a doctor ordering a full set of tests to take a
patient's temperature.
   ``It was the election of our discontent,'' CBS correspondent
Bruce Morton said in the early going, before the nation's dreaded
anti-incumbency mood stopped short of actually ousting any major
rascals.
   It had fewer commercials.
   And, for the first time, Cable News Network and the Big Three
broadcast networks pooled resources for election night exit polls
and winner projections, in a collaborative effort called Voter
Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   ``There are always problems the first time you do anything,''
said VRS spokeswoman Susan Morrison, adding that there were no big
problems with winner projections or the state exit polls.
   There was a delay in national exit polls, which tended to arrive
all at once, because VRS chief Warren Mitofsky wanted to ensure the
``weighting'' of 9,000 to 10,000 interviews accurately reflected
the national trends.
   ``It worked very well for us,'' said CNN spokeswoman Melinda
McIntire. By 9 p.m. EST, she said, VRS let the cable network
project 38 governor and Senate races. ``It's been extremely helpful
in our analyzing voters in geographic and demographic breakdowns.''
   By midnight, VRS had issued 72 projected winners in senate,
governor and referendum questions, Ms. Morrison said.
   ABC and NBC kept the first two hours of their prime time
entertainment, coverage, dropping in brief spot reports until
hourlong specials at 10 p.m. EST. CBS' coverage went the distance
from 9 p.m. to 11.
   But NBC's one-hour special and CBS' two hours were
``sustaining'' - read ``unsponsored'' - programs which don't count
in the November ratings ``sweeps'' that help local stations set
their advertising rates.
   The overall ratings race is tight this year, and typically low
election night ratings could pull down a network's overall numbers.
Top-rated NBC quickly followed suit after CBS said it would air no
commercials.
   CNN, which has no prime time entertainment programs, began its
coverage at 6 p.m. EST as ``The World Today'' neatly capsulized key
races. By 7 p.m., CNN's main coverage was in full swing.
   ABC and CBS led their nightly news shows with six-minute
election reports; their second story was the assassination of
radical Rabbi Meir Kahane. NBC led its news with nine minutes on
the election before getting to the Kahane story.
   CBS' election night anchor, Dan Rather, spent the night in
shirtsleeves, red tie and burgundy-striped suspenders. He also got
off the best quote, early ``We're going to be all over these races
like paint on a wall.''
   And the graphics!
   ABC and CBS colored their Democrats blue and the GOP red;
contrariwise, NBC made its Democrats red and the Republicans blue.
   ABC's ``The '90 Vote'' computer graphics screens had a
traditional look to them. Candidate pictures, numbers, percentages,
precincts reporting; and the network closed its main coverage with
a roll of the winners.
   NBC's ``Decision '90'' graphics were busy and postmodern: the
candidate pictures, superimposed on a split ppurple grid, beside
human silhouettes extending across a red or blue bar to the numeric
vote percentage.
   Then there were three diagonal red slashes pulsating across the
lower left corner while a narrow blue bar descended down the
screen.
   CNN listed the winners' names in gold, the losers in gray,
declaring projected winners with a chubby little check mark on a
bright red box.
   Unfortunately, CNN's party tags were donkey and elephant logos -
with blue backgrounds and red frames.
   CBS had outstanding line-score graphic rundowns of the winners,
picture, name, state, and a cute little logo of the state syumbol
(Hint: Maine was a lobster, Tennessee a coonskin cap
   CBS graphics outdid all others. Its snazzy, computer-driven,
green relief map of the United States giddily panned and tilted
from state to state at breakneck speed until some high-strung
producer probably told them to cut it out.
   CNN excelled with its team of four regional anchors who kept on
top of various races. In addition, CNN political reporter Brooks
Jackson covered the campaigns finances, coming up with some
surprising insights,
   CNN also gave the last eight minutes of each hour to the verbal
fisticuffs of ``The CNN Capital Gang,'' a four-member hodgepodge of
righty and lefty political pundits Michael Kinsley, Mark Shields,
Pat Buchanan and Robert Novak.
   After eight minutes, even the most casual viewer would want to
review U.S. policy against peacetime use of nuclear weapons.
   Shortly before 9 p.m. EST, the gang cut back to the venerable
CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, who looked bemused to the point of
snakebite. ``Don't you just love them?'' Shaw said without a
question mark in his voice.

   Acting Gov. Bob Miller strolled to his
first full term in office Tuesday in a campaign that hinged on
taxes and abortion.
   Miller was challenged by Republican Jim Gallaway, a wealthy
businessman and newcomer to Nevada politics who campaigned on a
no-new-taxes platform and criticized Miller for his anti-abortion
stand.
   With 10 percent of precincts reporting, Miller had 4,814 votes,
or 63 percent, to Gallaway's 2,615 votes, or 34 percent.
   Miller, a Democrat elected lieutenant governor in 1986, became

   Gov. Roy Romer waltzed to a second term Tuesday,
and Republican Rep. Hank Brown got a promotion to the U.S. Senate.
   A proposal to limit politicians' terms in office was approved,
and voters also considered a controversial tax limitation
amendment.
   Brown, 50, bested Democrat Josie Heath, a former Boulder County
commissioner. He succeeds Republican Sen. Bill Armstrong, who is
retiring.
   With 40 percent of precincts reporting, Brown had 206,303 votes,
or 57 percent, to 157,767 votes, or 43 percent, for Heath.
   Romer, 62, who first won office in 1986, faced challenger John
Andrews, an outside-the-mainstream Republican who alienated many
party members with his adamant support for the tax amendment, which
would put most tax and fee issues to a public referendum.
   With 40 percent of precincts reporting, Romer had 233,425 votes,
or 66 percent, to 121,674 votes, or 34 percent, for Andrews.
   The other high-profile initiative would limit the terms of state
elected officials and legislators to eight years, and congressional
and U.S. Senate terms to 12 years. The measure's proponents said it
was needed to inject new blood into Colorado's political
leadership.
   One Colorado congressional race was close. The prize was Brown's
former 4th District seat. State Sen. Wayne Allard, a Republican
from Longmont, led in initial returns ahead of state Rep. Dick
Bond, a Democrat from Greeley.
   With 44 percent of precincts reporting, Allard had 35,882 votes,
or 54 percent, to 30,408 votes, or 46 percent, for Bond.

   Kansas voters refused Tuesday to shift much

   Late evening returns showed the proposed constitutional
amendment trailing by 128,604 to 188,117 votes.
   The measure spurred serious opposition from education groups,
while no organization promoted it.
   ``The voters are saying that they are not willing to give the

Education Chairwoman Connie Hubbell of Topeka, who campaigned
against its passage.

   A fire raced through Universal
Studios on Tuesday night, burning down street sets where movies and
TV shows are filmed and forcing an evacuation of the studio and its
amusement park.
   Witnesses said the blaze, fanned by gusty winds, overran the
sprawling back lot of the 420-acre studio located 10 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The futuristic town square built
for the filming of ``Back to the Future, Part II'' was among the
areas burned, officials said.
   About 200 people, most of them studio and amusement park
employees, were evacuated.
   No evacuation was called at the nearby Universal Hilton, where
Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson has his
headquarters.
   Flames were reported at 7:18 p.m. and one ambulance was
dispatched to the scene. There were no immediate reports of
injuries, said police Sgt. Richard Thomas. The fire's cause was
being investigated.
   ``From our vantage point the fire is burning in the center of
the studio where our major facades are located,'' said Joan
Bullard, president of public relations at Universal.
   The fire raged in a ``sound stage area'' to the rear of the
studio lot, said Fire Department spokesman Pat Marek. At least 24
engines were sent to the blaze.
   A cloud of smoke hovered over the back lot where fake buildings
used as background for filming are constructed.
   The fire is not the first to strike Universal. In 1987, a stage
used for the 1959 epic ``Spartacus'' erupted in flames, causing
$2.5 million in damage.
   The facades burning included streets sets where the studio films
its New York street scenes and Sting Street, where the famous Paul
Newman and Robert Redford film was shot.
   The studio features a seven-hour tour attraction, which includes
a guided tram tour that takes viewers through film sets and a
simulated earthquake.
   ``The tour will be affected, but we have no information on how
at this time,'' Bullard said.
   Universal Studios was founded by Carl Laemmle in 1912. It did
not gain recognition until the 1920s, when it produced several
now-classic silent films, including ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
and ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
   Universal Studios is one of the older Hollywood lots and home to
such film classics as ``Psycho,'' by Alfred Hitchcock, ``The
Sting,'' ``Jaws'' and ``To Kill A Mockingbird.''
   Current television shows shot at Universal include ``Major
Dad,'' ``Murder She Wrote,'' ``Quantum Leap'' and ``Matlock.''

overwhelmingly rejected a streams protection proposal that

Proposition A, known as the Natural Streams Act.
   With 73.7 percent of the precincts reporting, the unofficial

   The act would have created a five-member state commission to
approve management plans for 52 scenic waterways, primarily in the
Ozarks.
   Backers said the commission was needed because voluntary
protection of waterways was not happening.Foes said it would create
a dictatorship that could mandate unreasonable regulations and

   A strong earthquake struck a mountainous
area of southern Iran on Tuesday night, killing at least 20 people
and heavily damaging at least a dozen villages, Iran's official
news agency reported.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said initial
readings put the quake's magnitude at 7.0 on the Richter scale.
Iran's Geophysics Center of Tehran University said it measured 6.6.
   An earthquake of that magnitude is capable of widespread, heavy
damage. A quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck northern
Iran on June 21, killing an estimated 50,000 people.
   Tuesday's quake struck at 9:47 p.m. and was centered in Fars
province near the city of Darab about 600 miles southeast of
Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   IRNA said at least 20 people were killed and more than 60
injured. It quoted Darab Gov. Yahya Hashemi as saying at least 12
villages were heavily damaged.
   Earlier reports from the region told of 100 casualties - dead
and wounded - counted an hour after the quake struck, said Alirez
Jafarzadeh, the Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for The People's
Mujahedeen of Iran.
   Jafarzadeh, whose group seeks to overthrow the Tehran
government, said he had no breakdown of dead and wounded.
   The quake, centered 50 miles east of the city of Darab, hit the
route that connects Darab with the port city of Bandar-Abbas on the

   ``This is a mountainous area,'' Jafarzadeh said. ``The

<HEAD>Ann Richards Takes Texas, Chiles Wins Florida as GOP Ousted in 3
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Lawton Chiles unseated Florida's Gov.
Bob Martinez, and Ann Richards won in Texas as Democrats wrested
two big states from GOP control Tuesday in elections that saw
incumbents struggle for political survival.
   Democratic challengers ousted Republican governors in Rhode
Island, Kansas and Florida.
   Richards' defeat of Republican Clayton Williams in Texas' bitter
and tumultuous governor's race capped a remarkable come-from-behind
race. Williams, a blunt-spoken Texas millionaire, squandered a big
lead in the polls through a series of verbal campaign gaffes.
   The GOP losses in Texas and Florida were stinging defeats for
President Bush, who visited Florida three times to stump for
Martinez and spent the last three days of the campaign in his
adoptive home state of Texas campaigning for Williams.
   Democrats were quick to point to the results as spelling
political trouble for the president.
   ``To the degree that George Bush was a factor, he was a
burden,'' said Ohio's retiring Gov. Richard Celeste, head of the
Democratic Governors Association. ``We have an opportunity to do
what was inconceivable six months ago - that is defeat a Republican
president.''
   Republicans scored gains too, however, and recaptured the
governorships in Vermont and Ohio, where Democrats are retiring.
   Republican Gov. Ed DiPrete lost the Rhode Island statehouse he
had held since 1984 to Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat he had defeated
twice before. Democrat Joan Finney defeated first-term Republican
Gov. Mike Hayden in Kansas.
   Maine's Republican Gov. John McKernan held a slim lead over
Democratic challenger Joseph Brennan, a former governor who led in
initial returns.
   Nebraska's Republican Gov. Kay Orr narrowly trailed her
Democratic challenger, Ben Nelson, with three-quarters of the votes
in.
   The Republican incumbents found themselves the victims of voter
anger over tax increases and regional economic downturns, as well
as various local issues. Abortion was a factor in several races,
with victories by both supporters and opponents of abortion rights.
   New England's recession hurt most of that region's incumbents,
and DiPrete suffered from scandals surrounding his family and
political allies. The GOP governors in Kansas and Nebraska were in
hot water over local property taxes.
   Some Democrats faced stiff challenges, too. Michigan Gov. James
Blanchard, bidding for a third term, narrowly trailed Republican
John Engler in incomplete returns.
   Republican George Voinovich won in Ohio, giving the GOP
Celeste's statehouse office. Celeste called it ``my special
disappointment.''
   An independent, former GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker, won a three-way
race in Connecticut, where the Democrat also is retiring.
   In the Democratic bastion of Massachusetts, Republican William
Weld held the slimmest of leads over outspoken conservative
Democrat John Silber. Republican hopes were boosted by Democratic
divisions in the state where former Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis is retiring as governor in the depths of
recession-inspired unpopularity.
   In Illinois, a state in GOP hands for more than a decade,
Democrat Neil Hartigan and Republican Jim Edgar were locked in a
virtual tie with more than half the vote in.
   Both parties had focused on the big-three states - California,
Texas and Florida - where governors will influence new
congressional district maps to be drawn next year.
   GOP Sen. Pete Wilson held the lead over Democrat Dianne
Feinstein in early returns from California.
   Democrat Barbara Roberts held a small lead in Oregon.
   With returns still far from complete, Democrats had scored a net
gain of four seats. They captured six governorships previously held
by Republicans: Florida, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Texas
and Kansas. And they led in several more, including Illinois and
Maine.
   Republicans won in two states now in Democratic hands, Ohio and
Vermont, and were leading in several others. They included
Massachusetts, Michigan and Minnesota.
   Martinez, who failed in his bid to become Florida's first
two-term Republican governor, called Chiles to concede defeat as
Chiles's substantial lead held up in incomplete returns.
   ``He was very, very gracious and said he wanted to help us with
the transition,'' said Chiles, who called the campaign ``the most
glorious, glorious time of my life.''
   Chiles' support for abortion rights was a significant factor in
the race, according to network television voter interviews. The
ex-senator also had refused to accept contributions over $200.
   Both Chiles and Connecticut's Weicker are former senators.
Weicker, defeated two years ago after three terms as a Senate
Republican, becomes the first independent governor elected since
Maine's James Longley in 1974.
   The Michigan race was a special target of abortion groups, as
Blanchard supported abortion rights and Engler opposed them.
   The Kansas race was a victory for abortion opponents as Finney,
the Democrat, was an abortion foe and Hayden, the GOP incumbent,
had supported abortion rights.
   Guy Hunt, Alabama's first Republican governor in this century,
withstood a strong challenge to win re-election over Democrat Paul
Hubbert.
   Democrat David Walters won in Oklahoma, where the Republican
incumbent was retiring. Georgia Democrat Zell Miller defeated
Republican Johnny Isakson.
   Democrats recaptured New Mexico, where the Republican incumbent
was retiring. The winner, Bruce King, is a former governor. Another
former governor, Republican Richard Snelling, won in Vermont.
   Republican governors winning re-election included Carroll
Campbell in South Carolina, Judd Gregg in New Hampshire, Tommy
Thompson in Wisconsin, George Mickelson in South Dakota and Terry
Branstad in Iowa.
   Democratic incumbents re-elected included Ned Ray McWherter in
Tennessee, William Donald Schaefer in Maryland, Robert P. Caey in
Pennsylvania, Bob Miller in Nevada, John Waihee in Hawaii, Cecil
Andrus in Idaho, Colorado's Roy Romer, Arkansas' Bill Clinton and
Wyoming's Mike Sullivan.
   Branstad's victory came despite a determined effort by
abortion-rights supporters; Andrus won despite stirring the wrath
of abortion foes by vetoing a bill that would have restricted legal
abortions.
   Voinovich won over Ohio Democrat Anthony Celebrezze in a race
where abortion-rights forces strongly backed the Democrat.
Celebrezze was a strong abortion opponent until last December when
he switched positions, drawing the enmity of his former allies and
earning a flip-flopper's tag that he never overcame.
   In Minnesota, two-term Gov. Rudy Perpich was locked in a close
race despite turmoil and scandal that engulfed his GOP opposition.
Republican Arne Carlson got on the ballot only last week after Jon
Grunseth stepped aside amid charges of sexual impropriety.

   Read their votes: no new taxes are likely to
escape unpunished at the polls.
   That was among the voter messages Tuesday night in off-year
elections that hit Republicans where it will hurt for a decade,
costing them governors just as the states get ready to draw new
lines for their congressional districts.
   Democrats were gaining reinforcements for their House majority -
a gain of about 10 seats was in prospect as the ballot count moved
westward - but their biggest prize was increased control in the
redistricting process that will be a major factor in shaping
congressional elections for the rest of the century.
   Republicans lost in Texas, a state in which their candidate for
governor was the early favorite. Democrat Ann Richards, the state
treasurer, won instead.
   In Florida, Lawton Chiles, a former senator, was elected
governor over a one-term Republican.
   The biggest GOP gubernatorial gain: Ohio, where former Cleveland
Mayor George Voinovich takes over after eight Democratic years.
   In competition for the Senate, there was no party turnover in
the partial count Tuesday night, and incumbents who ran won,
including North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, the conservative
Republican whose seat had seemed at risk. Democratic control never
was in doubt.
   And House incumbents were, once again, proving their staying
power. More than 95 percent of those who sought new terms got them.
At midnight, the partial count showed that five House incumbents
had lost, with a handful more in jeopardy.
   But in New Jersey, a Democratic state tax increase put a
surprising dent in the campaign of Sen. Bill Bradley, who had to
struggle to a narrow win over a Republican challenger who had not
looked like a serious threat.
   It wasn't a good night for the two-term senator who ranks among
the 1992 Democratic presidential prospects and was sure enough of
his own prospects to do some campaigning for candidates in other
states.
   Bradley apparently was caught in the undertow of resentment over
taxes that Gov. James J. Florio pushed through the legislature,
after ruling out increases during his 1989 campaign.
   And a hairline re-election edge is hardly good advertising for a
presidential campaign.
   Numbers were no problem for Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who
ranks atop most lists of 1992 Democratic prospects for the White
House. He won towering re-election.
   So did Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia, unopposed, and Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee.
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, another Democrat who's had
presidential ideas, won easy re-election, too. But Clinton returns
to office pledged to serve his full four-year term, which may rule
him out of 1992 competition.
   The tax issue dogged President Bush after he scrapped his ``read
my lips'' 1988 pledge against new taxes, saying as he campaigned
that congressional Democrats made him accept increases as the price
of a budget deal. It showed in his slumping polls. Some Republican
candidates tried to edge away from the administration late in the
campaign.
   That didn't always succeed. Rep. Peter Smith of Vermont
trumpeted his differences with Bush when the president came to
campaign for him. Tuesday night, Smith lost to Socialist Bernard
Sanders, former mayor of Burlington, who ran narrowly behind him
two years ago. Sanders would vote with the Democratic majority in
the House.
   In Rhode Island and Kansas, tax-troubled Republican governors
lost. Another Republican governor was locked in a tight struggle in
Nebraska. Republican Gov. John McKernan led narrowly in Maine,
where he had been deemed a likely loser.
   Massachusetts Democrats had trounced the establishment in their
primary, ousting Democrats linked to outgoing Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, who pushed through a massive state tax increase earlier
this year. But the voters there spurned a ballot measure that would
have rolled back $2.6 billion in state taxes. Democrat John Silber
and Republican William Weld were matched in a close count for
governor there.

   District of Columbia voters denied
scandal-scarred Marion Barry a city council seat Tuesday and
replaced him in the mayor's office with Sharon Pratt Dixon, a
Democrat who promised to clean house in the troubled capital.
   Jesse Jackson also won his first elected office, an unpaid,
non-voting ``shadow'' Senate seat from which he will attempt to
persuade Congress to make the District of Columbia a state.
   Dixon became the first black woman elected to lead a major
American city. She led former police chief Maurice T. Turner, the
Republican, 86 percent to 12 percent.
   Civil rights activist Eleanor Holmes Norton was elected
non-voting House delegate, defeating Republican Harry Singleton
despite revelations that Norton and her husband, Edward, had paid
no local taxes for seven years, beginning in 1983. Norton received
59 percent of the vote, compared to 30 percent for Singleton.
   Jackson won an 11-candidate ``shadow'' Senate race with 44
percent of the vote.
   Voters narrowly rejected a referendum that would have restored a
comprehensive overnight shelter law that required the city to
provide refuge to any homeless person that demands it. The city
council gutted the law earlier this year amid complaints that
housing the homeless had become too expensive. The measure to
restore the original law failed by a margin of 51 percent to 49
percent.
   But the day belonged to Dixon, who rode her reformist platform
into the office Barry has held since 1978.
   Dixon was swept to victory with her pledge to root out
corruption and waste within the city government. Chief among her
promises has been to cut 2,000 middle-level managers from the city
payroll, a move she has said will save $95 million.
   Turner hit Dixon for her lack of experience and said her plan to
immediately cut the district's work force was inhumane.
   Barry failed in his bid to win a city-wide council seat, despite
his claim to have rebounded from the personal woes that led to his
drug conviction and sentencing to a six-month prison term. He is
free while appealing.
   The mayor finished third behind Democratic nominee Linda Cropp,
who had 39 percent of the vote, and the incumbent, Statehood party
nominee Hilda Mason, who had 30 percent of the vote. Barry had 19
percent.

   Incumbent Democrat Daniel Akaka fended off
Republican challenger Patricia Saiki on Tuesday in a
down-to-the-wire race for a U.S. Senate seat. Democratic Gov. John
Waihee triumphed over Republican challenger Fred Hemmings.
   In the Senate contest, with 72 percent of precincts reporting,
Akaka had 69,947 votes, or 54 percent, to 57,326 votes, or 45
percent, for Saiki.
   In the governor's race, with 72 precincts reporting, Waihee had
76,489 votes, or 62 percent, to 46,638 votes, or 38 percent, for
Hemmings.
   Two Democrats, former Rep. Neil Abercrombie and interim Rep.
Patsy Mink, were favored to win their respective races for the
state's two U.S. House seats.
   Akaka was appointed to the Senate last May after the death of
Sen. Spark Matsunaga. Mink won a special election Sept. 22 to fill
the remaining months of Akaka's House term.
   The main issue in the Senate campaign was which candidate would
be most effective in Washington. Akaka cited ties to the Democratic
majority, while Saiki cited her ties to the Bush administration.
   Abercrombie, who served a brief stint in the House in 1986 after
Rep. Cecil Heftel resigned to run for governor, was opposed in the
contest for Saiki's old seat by Republican state Rep. Michael Liu.
   Mink, who previously served 12 years in the House, was opposed
by Republican Andrew Poepoe.

   Ann Richards won her rough-and-tumble fight
for governor of Texas and another Democratic treasurer, Joan
Finney, captured the governor's mansion in Kansas as a record
number of women and blacks sought state and national posts Tuesday.
   Connecticut voters elected conservative businessman Gary Franks
as the first black Republican member of the House since the
Depression.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., turned back Harvey Gantt's bid to
become the first black senator from the South since Reconstruction.
   In New Jersey, Republican challenger Christine Todd Whitman gave
a scare to Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley before losing. The little
known ex-utility commissioner raised a fraction of Bradley's $12
million warchest, but capitalized on antitax fervor.
   Democrat Barbara Roberts was leading in Oregon's gubernatorial
race.
   But women lost seven of their eight senate races, with only
incumbent Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., in the victory column.
   Women challengers lost to incumbent male senators in New Jersey,
Hawaii, Illinois, Rhode Island, Delaware and Wyoming, and Democrat
Josie Heath was defeated by Rep. Hank Brown for an open Senate seat
in Colorado.
   But Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr was fighting for her political life in
a tight race against Democrat Ben Nelson.
   Finney, 65, Kansas treasurer for the past 16 years and an
abortion opponent, toppled pro-choice Republican Gov. Mike Hayden,
whose campaign foundered over taxes.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who staked her campaign on an adamant
stand against tax hikes, lost her bid to unseat Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, a Democrat. Another GOP congresswoman, Claudine Schneider,
was soundly defeated by Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell in Rhode
Island.
   Richards, 67, defeated Clayton Williams, an oilman and political
neophyte whose joke about rape cast a cloud over his campaign.
   Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's Campaign Fund,
called it ``an exciting night'' for women candidates. The fund
supports pro-choice candidates in both parties.
   ``Most of (Richards') last-minute strength from women voters
came on the abortion issue - or the combination of abortion and
sexism on his part,'' Danowit said.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell, a Republican, easily
turned back a challenge from Democratic State Sen. Theo Mitchell,
who had hoped to become the state's first black governor.
   A Gantt win would have given the Senate its first black member
since Edward Brooke, R-Mass., was defeated 12 years ago.
   Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, a black political think tank, said, ``We've
seen the triumph of racism over reason in North Carolina. ... It's
sort of Willie Horton all over again.''
   Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic former mayor of San Francisco,
was challenging Sen. Pete Wilson for the governorship in
California.
   Overall, there were eight women running for governor - four from
each party - and eight women vying for Senate seats, all but two of
them Republicans.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., easily won re-election. The
Senate's only other incumbent woman, Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., was
not up this year.
   Despite a recent campaign foray to Hawaii by President Bush,
Republican Rep. Pat Saiki failed in her bid to unseat Sen. Daniel
Akaka, the Democrat appointed to the Senate after Sen. Spark
Matsunaga died earlier this year.
   Williams' center predicted the 24-member Congressional Black
Caucus would gain one to three members.
   New Orleans was electing a black Democrat to succeed retiring
Rep. Lindy Boggs in an open runoff pitting attorney Marc Morial
against state Sen. William Jefferson.
   Franks, a Yale-educated businessman and alderman in Waterbury,
Conn., won an open seat race against former Democratic Rep. Toby
Moffett. The last black Republican to serve in the House was Oscar
de Priest from Illinois in 1935.
   Liberal Democratic activist Rosa De Lauro won another open House
seat in New Haven, Conn.
   The nation's two other incumbent women governors, Madeline Kunin
in Vermont and Rose Mofford in Arizona, chose not to run for
re-election.
   Women were vying for 66 House seats and eight Senate seats. In
two House races, both candidates were women.
   There are currently 29 women in the House and two in the Senate.
The House has 24 blacks, 13 Hispanics and one American Indian.

   The measure would have imposed a tax of 43 cents per pack on
cigarettes, up from 18 cents, and doubled the tax on other tobacco
products.
   The tobacco industry spent more than $1.1 million to defeat the
measure, saying the tax revenue would be used only to hire more

   Oregon voters approved a measure Tuesday
to shut off welfare payments to the poor and offer low-paying jobs
instead.
   Incomplete, unofficial returns showed 57 percent of voters
favoring it.
   The measure would establish a three-year pilot program in six
counties that eliminates food stamps, federal aid to families with
dependent children and unemployment benefits.
   However, the proposal cannot go into effect unless Congress
waives a number of federal laws and regulations.
   Under the plan, people who are eligible for public assistance
would be assigned to jobs with public or private employers and
would be paid at 90 percent of the state's minimum wage, currently
$4.25 an hour.
   Opponents said the measure offered little more than slavery.

   Louisiana on Tuesday elected its first black
congressman since Reconstruction. State Sen. William Jefferson
defeated Marc Morial, the son of the late New Orleans Mayor Dutch
Morial.
   Both Jefferson, 43, and Morial, 32, are black Democrats.
Jefferson will succeed Democratic Rep. Lindy Boggs, who is retiring
after 17 years in the House.
   With all precincts reporting, Jefferson had 55,371 votes, or 52
percent, to Morial's 50,197 votes, or 48 percent.
   The election had no effect on the makeup of the state's
congressional delegation - four Democrats and four Republicans.
   It was the only congressional race left unresolved in Louisiana.
All the incumbent representatives won re-election in the Oct. 6
primary.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., also won re-election in the
primary, turning aside a widely publicized challenge by former Ku
Klux Klan grand dragon David Duke.

<TEXT>
   The government's plan to build a dioxin
incinerator at Times Beach was dealt at least a minor setback by
St. Louis County residents voting on an advisory referendum
Tuesday.
   The vote, with 60 percent of the ballots counted, was 95,845
against building the incinerator and 81,708 in favor.
   Opponents of the incinerator, who sponsored the non-binding
referendum, hoped that a resounding `no' vote would convince state
leaders, particularly Gov. John Ashcroft, to stop the project.
   The incinerator would burn dioxin-tainted soil from Times Beach
and 27 other eastern Missouri sites. Opponents say it would be
unsafe in a heavily populated area such as St. Louis County and
that it should not be built in a flood plain.

   Democrats wrested governorships from the GOP in Texas, Florida
and four other states on Tuesday in midterm elections that sealed a
season of Republican disappointment. Democrats also expanded their
dominion of Congress in returns that heavily favored the
incumbents.
   North Carolina GOP Sen. Jesse Helms won re-election in the most
closely watched Senate race of 34 on the ballot.
   Democrats elected Ann Richards as governor of Texas and Lawton
Chiles in Florida, giving them the last word in redistricting that
will add House seats to both Sunbelt states for the next decade.
   ``I'm sorry I let you down,'' Williams said in his concession
speech. President Bush had spent the final weekend of the campaign
in Texas and Williams defeat just punctuated a painful autumn for
Bush.
   Republicans looked to Pete Wilson to hold the California
governship in his race against Dianne Feinstein, and he was
leading.
   If voters were trying to express any discontent, it certainly
did not affect the Senate, where 30 out of 31 incumbents were being
reelected. The lone endangered senator was Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota; a victory by Paul Wellstone would pad the Democrats'
current 55-45 majority.
   Upsets were few and far between, but Wisconsin's Democratic Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier fell after 15 liberal terms in the House. House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich was in a shocker, barely winning a
50-50 Georgia race.
   Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley survived a surprise close call,
winning re-election with 52 percent of the vote against a
little-known opponent who campaigned against tax increases
engineered by a Democratic governor.
   Mark Hatfield won a 5th term as Republican senator from Oregon
in a close race.
   Democrats renewed control over the House and aimed to improve
their 259-176 majority, although the modest additions were not much
to brag about.
   The GOP got good news in Ohio, where George Voinovich won a
Democratic governorship, and in Massachusetts, where William Weld
will succeed Michael Dukakis. Republicans were ahead in races to
retain the statehouse in Illinois and Maine.
   In Connecticut, Gary Franks became the first black House
Republican since 1935.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker vexed the GOP again, this time as an
outsider, with an independent victory for governor of Connecticut.
Republican Gov. Kay Orr was trailing, barely, in Nebraska.
   Vermont sent Socialist Bernie Sanders to the House - in place of
a Republican. But former GOP Gov. Richard Snelling won his old job
back, and with it, the statehouse for his party.
   The polls were still open in half the nation when the Democrats
proclaimed victory and pointed the voters toward the 1992
presidential race. ``I couldn't feel better,'' said Ron Brown,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``Both Republicans
and Democrats ran against George Bush.''
   Charles Black spoke for the Republican National Committee,
telling reporters, ``It appears to be more of an anti-incumbent
trend than a partisan trend.'' He called the midterm results ``an
anti-Congress trend rather than an anti-president trend,'' even
though incumbent members were being reelected at a substantial
rate.
   Well after midnight, there was no shortage of close statehouse
races:
   - John Engler was battling Democratic Gov. James Blanchard in
Michigan.
   - GOP Gov. John McKernan clung to a lead over former Gov. Joseph
Brennan in Maine.
   - Illinois GOP Secretary of State Jim Edgar led Neil Hartigan.
   - Democrat Rudy Perpich trailed Arne Carlson in a tough
Minnesota race marked by Republican turmoil. Carlson was on the
ballot only because Jon Grunseth dropped out in late October over
allegations of sexual improprieties.
   Helms bested Harvey Gantt in his marquee race for reelection in
a contest that pitted one of the nation's best known conservatives
against a former black mayor. ``I'm sorry I'm so late,'' he told
supporters, ``but I've been home watching the grieving face of Dan
Rather ... the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and
columnists have struck out again.''
   Appointed Democratic Sen. Dan Akaka won re-election in Hawaii,
dashing the Republicans only serious hope for a Senate takeover.
   Three GOP representatives were elected to open Republican senate
seats: Bob Smith in New Hampshire, Hank Brown in Colorado and Larry
Craig in Idaho.
   Alabama GOP Gov. Guy Hunt won a close race for re-election.
   More than 6,100 legislative races crowded the ballots, and
voters in 43 states and the District of Columbia decided ballot
issues. Massachusetts rejected a proposed tax rollback.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo won in a possible prelude to a 1992
Democratic presidential campaign. Besides Bill Bradley, two other
potential challengers to President Bush won easy Senate reelection
- Al Gore in Tennessee, Sam Nunn in Georgia.
   Bush voted in his home state of Texas after an energetic yet
awkward campaign for GOP candidates, then returned to the White
House to read the returns. Bush sparked a Republican rebellion when
he broke his memorable 1988 campaign pledge and embraced an October
deficit-reduction plan that raised tax rates.
   ``George Bush obviously has had a little setback on the polls
but he's still the most popular president going into midterm
elections in modern times,'' said Ed Rollins, the top political
adviser to House Republicans.
   All in all, the first election of the 1990s came at a time of
extraordinary volatility - with the nation on the verge of
recession and on the edge of war in the Persian Gulf. Other issues
emerged in scattered races - abortion, crime, the savings and loan
crisis and ethics scandals among them.
   The pollsters agreed the voters were unhappy with the government
and pessimistic about the economy, but that failed to translate
into widespread anti-incumbency.
   In Florida, Chiles won handily over first-term Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez.
   Democrat David Walters grabbed the open Republican governorship
in Oklahoma. Bruce Sundlun wrested the governorship from
Republicans in hard-times Rhode Island, ousting Edward DiPrete.
Former Gov. Bruce King's successful comeback returned New Mexico to
the Democratic column, and Joan Finney ousted GOP Gov. Mike Hayden
in Kansas.

   Democrats on Tuesday padded their overwhelming
control of political redistricting, plucking the potent Florida and
Texas governorships from GOP hands and adding Rhode Island,
Oklahoma and New Mexico to their remapping monopolies.
   The Florida and Texas defeats were disastrous for Republicans,
and Democrats were in the running for the only remaining major GOP
redistricting weapon - the California governorship.
   Democrats clearly will have a huge edge when lines are drawn for
1992 congressional races, all but cementing the Republicans as the
House minority for another decade and perhaps far longer. And
Democrats were calling the Texas and Florida victories a boost for
their 1992 presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said Democratic National Committee
political director Paul Tully. ``These are not only net victories
but victories in places that because of their population growth
will grow more important to the future of this country and also to
the presidential race.''
   In all, eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when House
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts of the
1980s, according to preliminary census data. Democrats will control
the process outright in at least five of the states gaining House
seats.
   The Ohio governorship was the only significant redistricting
victory for Republicans as results from gubernatorial and
legislative races trickled in. So frustrating was the GOP's night
that the only redistricting monopoly the GOP gained was in Vermont
- which has only one House seat anyway.
   Despite the millions spent on oft-ignored state races with the
post-Census redistricting in mind, it appeared but a few of the
dozen targeted chambers would change hands.
   The GOP turned back Democratic efforts to take over the New
York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Senates. Redistricting power in all
three states, which will lose House seats in 1992, will be shared.
   Republicans failed in their bid to wrest the Illinois Senate
from Democrats but won a close governor's race to keep a say in
redistricting there. The GOP was trailing in bids to win over the
Democratic Florida Senate and Pennsylvania House. Early returns
showed control of the Oregon House within reach.
   The Indiana House was likely to go from GOP hands to the
Democrats. Other Democratic targets were the state senates in
Indiana, Michigan and Washington and both chambers in Arizona.
   The GOP suffered a big loss when Democrat Lawton Chiles unseated
Florida's Republican governor, and things would only get worse.
   The Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico governor's offices
went from Republican to Democratic hands and then Texas was seized
by the Democrats too.
   Democrats now will have sole power over the remapping in those
states. Florida is likely to gain four House seats and Texas three.
The House delegations in Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico
won't change, but control of redistricting should allow Democrats
to draw districts that protect their House incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers.
   Another victory for Democrats came in Kansas, where by unseating
a Republican governor the party went from being shut out of the
process to having veto power in redistricting. Kansas will lose one
House seat.
   The Republicans' last hope was California, which will get seven
of the 19 shifting seats. But even with a win in the governor's
race there the GOP would only share the power with the Democratic
legislature.
   Democrats, with huge majorities in many legislative chambers,
were virtually assured a redistricting voice in all the
battleground states even before the polls opened Tuesday.
   The day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's 99
legislative chambers and 29 of the 50 governorships.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers are held by narrow majorities.
   Even with California undecided, the Democrats were in position
to draw districts that in 1992 likely would pad their majority in
the House, now at 258-175, by a dozen seats or more beyond whatever
gains they made in Tuesday's elections.
   Preliminary census data suggest the remaining five House seats
that shift will go to Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Washington
and Arizona. Among those states, redistricting control was a
serious question only in Arizona. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in Virginia and kept hold of their sole
control in North Carolina and Georgia. A nonpartisan commission
draws the map in Washington.
   Democrats were facing uphill odds in their effort to erase the
Arizona GOP's 17-13 Senate and 34-26 House majorities. But Democrat
Terry Goddard was leading in early returns in the governor's race .
If elected, he could veto any redistricting plan drawn by a
possibly Republican legislature.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, New York will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was headed to easy re-election and the New York
Assembly had a 92-58 Democratic majority entering Tuesday's voting.
Results were slow to come in, but Democrats conceded they would not
capture the Senate, where they had hoped to wipe out a five-seat
Republican majority and gain a redistricting monopoly.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be Massachusetts, New Jersey, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Democrats control
the process in New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana.
In Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas and Montana the power will be
shared.

   The environmental movement suffered major setbacks Tuesday in
California, Oregon and Missouri, while taxing and spending limits
in Massachusetts and a half dozen other states also fared poorly at
the polls.
   Voters backed liberal abortion laws in Oregon and Nevada.
   But residents in California, Colorado and Kansas City vented
their anger at incumbents by approving limits on the number of
terms politicians can serve.
   California Proposition 128, known as ``Big Green,'' was trailing
badly: with 11 percent of the vote in, 71 percent were against it.
   The measure, one of 28 on California's heavily-loaded ballot,
would phase out many pesticides, ban oil development in state
waters, ban chemicals that harm the ozone layer, and require a
dramatic reduction in emissions of gases that contribute to global
warming.
   A proposed $1.97 billion environmental bond in New York was
trailing by a 51-49 percent margin with 97 percent of the vote in.
   In Oregon, voters turned down tough recycling regulations and
rejected a proposed shutdown of the state's only nuclear plant.
   Missourians defeated a ``Natural Streams'' measure protecting
scenic waterways in the Ozark Mountains by a 75-25 percent margin,
with 99 percent of the vote in.
   And Washington state residents were soundly rejecting, by a
74-26 percent margin, an initiative that would have required the
state to set up boards mandating local land use planning.
   Early returns showed a South Dakota measure that proposed limits
on Black Hills mining was trailing narrowly, but a second one
imposing limits on garbage dumping was ahead.
   Among the anti-taxing, anti-spending measures on a half dozen
state ballots, Massachusetts voters defeated Question 3, which
would have reduced taxes by $2.6 billion in fiscal 1992. It would
have been the nation's largest voter-initiated state tax cut in
history.
   In Montana, voters rejected a novel proposal that would have
replaced all state sales, income and property taxes with a one
percent charge on all financial transactions.
   Montanans also voted against a proposition boosting their
cigarette tax to the highest levels in the nation.
   Nebraskans trounced a proposed two percent lid on state and
local spending by a 69-31 percent margin.
   And in Utah, voters turned down a measure that would have
eliminated the sales tax on most food.
   Tough anti-taxing, anti-spending limits appeared on other state
ballots including Colorado, California, and Oregon.
   In another key contest considered crucial by the nation's
education community, Oregonians rejected a sweeping ``choice''
initiative that would have allowed parents up to a $2,500 tax
credit to educate their children in any public or private school
they wish, including parochial schools, or even at home.
   The measure lost by a 69-31 percent margin with 20 percent of
the vote counted.
   Among the 236 ballot measures voters confronted in 43 states
confronted on Election Day:
   - Oregon voters turned aside by a 2-1 margin a measure that
would have banned most abortions except to save the life of the
mother. They also rejected a second measure requiring parental
consent for abortions on minors.
   And with 41 percent of the vote counted, Nevada residents were
favoring by a 61-39 percent margin a measure protecting that
state's liberal law from legislative tampering.
   - Oregon voters also decided to make it illegal not to buckle up
in their cars.
   - With 42 percent of precincts counted, 84 percent of Florida
voters favored a constitutional amendment requiring a three-day
wait on hangun purchases.
   - A Colorado proposal limiting terms of politicians, including
U.S. senators and congressmen, won easily. With 48 percent of
precincts reporting, 70 percent voted in favor, 30 percent against.
   In California, a conservative-backed measure limiting terms on
state politicians led by a wide margin in early returns. A rival
measure that also included ethics reform and public campaign
financing appeared headed for defeat.
   With 99 percent of the vote in, Kansas City, Mo., residents
passed a limit on the number of terms city council members can
serve.
   - On Staten Island, voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum
to start a process that could lead to secession for the smallest of
New York City's five boroughs.
   - InKansas, residents defeated a proposed amendment that would
shift much of the authority over schools from existing state
education boards to the legislature.
   - Washington, D.C., voters were rejecting by a 54-46 percent
margin a referendum restoring the right of homeless to overnight
shelter, a right eroded by the city council earlier this year.
   - In Maine, a ballot measure abolishing the state's tough blue
laws, which force most big retailers to close on Sundays was
narrowly leading with 27 percent of precincts counted.
   Voters in predominantly black Boston neighborhoods decided
whether to launch studies on possible secessions from their
respective cities.
   On the education front, Nebraskans considered repealing a school
tax reform package featuring higher sales and income taxes in order
to ease reliance on property taxes.
   Arizona Proposition 103, the Classroom Improvement Initiative,
was losing by a 65-35 percent margin with 15 percent of the vote
in. It would require the legislature to increase public school
spending by $100 per pupil in each of the next 10 years. The
pricetag has been estimated at up to $6 billion.
   A second Arizona measure making Martin Luther King's birthday a
state holiday held a slight, 51-49 percent lead with 16 percent of
the vote counted.
   At stake on Alaska's ballot was the nation's most liberal
marijuana law. A proposal would recriminalize private possession of
pot.
   Among other notable local contests, a proposal in Santa Clara
County, Calif., to finance a new stadium to lure the San Francisco
Giants was trailing badly in early returns.
   Sacramento voters were deciding on a city-county merger that
would make it the nation's seventh largest city.
   In Seattle, voters considered a measure repealing spousal
benefits for live-in companions of municipal employees.
   San Franciscans considered a less sweeping ``domestic partners''
measure which would allow non-married live-in couples, including
homosexuals, to register their relationships with city officials
but without conferring formal benefits.

   Californians overwhelmingly rejected the
sweeping ``Big Green'' initiative Tuesday, an environmentalist's
dream list of strict controls on emissions, pesticides, offshore
drilling and logging.
   With 23 percent of precincts reporting, Proposition 128 was
losing by a 2-1 margin. Surveys of voters exiting polling places
indicated the measure would lose decisively.
   Calling it the most comprehensive environmental initiative ever
proposed, conservation groups spent $4.5 million campaigning for
Proposition 128 as a national model for environmental protections.
   A long list of Hollywood celebrities lent support, including
Jack Lemmon, Gregory Peck, Robert De Niro, Kirk Douglas, Harrison
Ford, Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Barbra Streisand.
   Industry foes, who spent $10 million to defeat the measure,
argued it would cost several billion dollars annually in higher
gas, electricity and food prices. Supporters said it would save
several billion dollars a year in energy and health costs.
   Opponents also disparagingly dubbed it the ``Hayden Initiative''
after supporter Tom Hayden, a state assemblyman whose name still
stirs strong emotions as a symbol of '60s protests.
   ``Big Green'' called for $300 million in bond funds to buy and
preserve ancient redwood forests, try to slow global warming by
curbing auto and other emissions, limit oil development in state
waters, and bar pesticides suspected of causing cancer. It also set
up an elective post of environmental czar.
   Supporters said the measure was a patchwork of legislation
rejected by lawmakers under pressure from special interests. Some
of the lanuage, particularly sections dealing with pollution from
refrigeration systems, is nearly identical to the Clean Air Act
passed by Congress last week.

   ``Cheers'' last week was the most-watched show
on television for the fifth time this season, while The Cos beat
little Bart again.
   ``Cheers,'' the barroom comedy that marks its 200th episode o
Thursday, averaged a 22.4 rating, helping NBC win the week with an
average prime-time rating of 13.5, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported
Tuesday.
   CBS, whose ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder She Wrote'' each had its
highest ratings of the season, was second with a 12.6. ABC had an
11.9. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   NBC rolled out a special hour version of ``The Cosby Show'' go
up against Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' on Thursday, and
Bill Cosby won easily against Bart Simpson and his cartoon family.
   ``Cosby'' received an 18.6 to a 15.8 for the Fox show when the
two competed for 30 minutes, and drew a 20.2 rating for the full
hour.
   In the news ratings, ABC and Peter Jennings won for the 43rd
consecutive week. It averaged an 11.4. CBS and Dan Rather had a
10.0, NBC and Tom Brokaw a 9.5.
   The week's top 10 list was dominated by old reliables, save for
the hit movie ``Three Men and a Baby'' on NBC and ABC's new
``America's Funniest People.'' They were fourth and 10th,
respectively, with a 19.9 and an 18.0.
   After ``Cheers,'' the other top-rated shows, their network and
their ratings were ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 21.4; ``Cosby,'' NBC, 20.2;
``Designing Women'' on CBS and ``Roseanne'' on ABC, tied at 19.1;
``Murder She Wrote'' and ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos,''
tied at 18.8, and CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' 18.7.

   David Letterman, whose house has been
broken into six times by a fan, called police when he found a pair
of autograph seekers waiting in his driveway.
   No charges were filed in the incident, which occurred about 2
a.m. Saturday, authorities said.
   Police said they didn't know if the fans got the talk show
host's autograph.
   Margaret Ray of Crawford, Colo., was sentenced to a year in
prison after breaking into Letterman's home for a sixth time in
March. She told authorities at one point that she was Letterman's

   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) - Phil Donahue heads to this
once-prosperous Mississippi River town to ask, ``Can Anything Be
Done to Save This Dying City?''
   The ``Donahue'' show will be taped Monday at a high school here.
   The New York-based syndicated program will look at the
transformation from a national rail and stockyard center to ``a
desolate and dying city,'' said spokeswoman Alyssa Schwartz.
   ``Thousands of jobs have gone with the closing of factories,
leaving the city a pocket of hopeless poverty, trash-strewn vacant
lots, block after block of boarded-up houses, and crime and drugs
running rampant,'' Schwartz said.
   No date has been selected for the segment to air nationally.

be honored Nov. 20. The plaza will be renamed Judd Plaza.
   The pair, whose hits include ``Mama, He's Crazy'' and
``Grandpa,'' also will serve that day as grand marshals of a
Christmas Parade.
   Naomi Judd has announced plans to retire after their latest
concert tour because of hepatitis. Her daughter will continue a

themselves immensely.''
   Clower has recorded 20 albums during a 20-year performing career
and has also written three books.

   Andrew J. Willett knew just what his constituency
would be doing on Election Day.
   Willett is ``mayor'' of the Grate Society, as he and 15 to 20
fellow homeless people call themselves in a grim parody of the
social welfare experiment of the 1960s that aimed to wipe out
hunger and poverty.
   On Election Day, as on most other days, Willett and others hang
out near the Boston Public Library. In the morning they wash up at
a transit stop, then panhandle long enough to get money for food,
cigarettes and alcohol.
   They sleep on grates to stay warm, avoiding shelters as too
dangerous or too rigid.
   ``I would rather stay outside,'' said Willett, who also acts as
the group's ``banker,'' keeping track of the money earned by
panhandling, or ``stemming, until there is enough for ``a run'' -
usually to the liquor store.
   Two years after President Bush called for a kinder, gentler
nation, the homeless are as much a part of the urban landscape as
graffiti and traffic.
   They are also among society's most vulnerable citizens and could
be among the most affected by efforts in Massachusetts to get the
budget under control.
   Willett, a 39-year-old Vietnam veteran with a heavy limp, a
useless left hand and a fondness for ginger brandy, said most of
the day is spent stemming. In the language of the street, pennies
are ``goobers'' and ``dumpster-diving'' is searching for food in
the garbage.
   Nights are the most difficult because of the danger of being
robbed. Members of the Grate Society sleep in shifts.
   ``Just like society at large, some homeless prey on each
other,'' said police Sgt. John Devaney. ``They steal their liquor,
their money.''
   On the streets, loyalty is paramount, Willett said.
   When Michael S. Hathaway, 20, began living on the streets three
years ago, Willett took him under his wing. ``If it wasn't for
Andrew Willett, I would be deceased today,'' Hathaway said. ``I'd
do anything for Andy. We're like a family.''
   Hathaway said Willett, who has been on the streets about two
decades and is known to the Grate Society as its mayor, found him
walking around Copley Square and showed him where to sleep and get
free clothes and free food.
   ``I know so much about the streets now that I could teach
someone else,'' he said. Hathaway said he repays Willett by
watching out for him.
   No one knows how many street people are in Boston. The Emergency
Shelter Commission counted 3,830 in shelters and on the streets in
December 1989.
   Paul Koegel, an anthropologist working for the psychiatry
department at the University of California at Los Angeles, found
that 28 percent of the nation's homeless suffered from severe,
chronic mental disorders and 46 percent were chronic substance
abusers. Both conditions are likely to be worsened by homelessness,
he found.
   ``A very significant minority experienced their alcohol problems
after their first episode of homelessness,'' said Koegel.
   Rob Smith, 27, may be one of that minority. He sits near the
Grate Society along with Lisa Fuller, 37, and Reggie Hammond, 31.
Every day at 8 a.m., they meet outside a liquor store near Boston
Common.
   ``I wasn't drinking before. Now I'm drinking like crazy,'' said
Smith, who was evicted from his apartment over the summer.
   ``You got to drink to survive,'' said Hammond. ``You drink all
day and sleep all night. You've heard of false courage. Drinking
gives you false courage so you don't worry.''
   Hammond's brother saw Smith through his first night of
homelessness. ``It was scary. I didn't know what to expect,'' Smith
said.
   But now he's a pro. Recently he reasoned that Logan
International Airport would be a good place to sleep because air
travelers need comfortable seats. So he went there one day after a
restless night and slept four blissful hours.
   Smith said he has had no luck getting a job, in part because he
has no phone.
   ``Where they gonna call you at?''

<HEAD>University Offers $1 Million Settlement to Former President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American University is offering a settlement
of more than $1 million to former president Richard Berendzen, who
pleaded guilty to charges he made obscene telephone calls,
according to a published report.
   The Washington Post, quoting unnamed sources, reported today
that in return, the university's board of trustees would ask
Berendzen to sever his ties with the university.
   Since resigning as president, Berendzen has continued to draw a
salary as a tenured physics professor, although he has not worked
on campus.
   According to the newspaper's sources, university trustees
authorized the proposed settlement, which is not final, during a
closed meeting Friday.
   Sources said the decision followed an acrimonious debate in
which several trustees argued that the payment was too expensive
while others said Berendzen should not be forced to relinquish his
university affiliation.
   Berendzen quit as university president in April, saying he was
exhausted after 10 years in the job. Later that month, he
acknowledged that he actually had resigned because trustees learned
he was under police investigation for allegedly placing obscene
telephone calls to a woman who ran a day-care service.
   Susan Allen of Fairfax County, Va., said that in repeated phone
calls to her, he graphically discussed fantasized sexual relations
with children.
   Berendzen pleaded guilty to two charges of making the telephone
calls. Alen has sued him, seeking $2 million in compensatory
damages and $2 million in punitive damages.
   Lawyers for the university and for Berendzen were negotiating
how the payments would be made, the Post said. The paper quoted one
source as saying the proposed payment ``was in the ballpark'' of $1
million, and another said the figure exceeded $1 million.
   Berendzen declined comment to the newspaper, saying, ``I really
just don't want to get into anything dealing with contracts.''
   University spokeswoman Anita Gottlieb told the Post, ``after
January, there will be no continuing relationship with Dr.
Berendzen and the university.''

   Pvt. Alonzo Range made his first
shot with a Dragon wire-guided, anti-tank missile a good one.
   He obliterated a practice target from 500 yards away.
   Fellow troopers of the 82nd Airborne Division whooped and
cheered when the missile found its target Tuesday and exploded in a
ball of flame and thunder.
   ``Beautiful! Airborne!'' the soldiers yelled.
   The Dragon is shoulder-fired, but the gunner must keep the
target in its sight to guide it on its path. The naked eye can
follow the missile as it dips and weaves down range.
   ``It's effective against any armor, including the T-72,'' said
Range, 21, of New York City. He was referring to the
top-of-the-line Soviet model tank that the Iraqis have in their
arsenal.
   ``I'm fairly confident we can take them out,'' Range said.
   He was jubilant about his success.
   ``It was better than sex - almost,'' Range quipped.
   Elements of the 1st Battalion, 505th Paratroop Regiment took to
the firing range for drills with machine guns, rifles, shotguns,
grenades, anti-tank rockets and trench warfare.
   ``We given them challenging training to give them a focus,''
said battalion commander Lt. Col. John Schmader. ``We're training
for our worldwide contingency mission.''
   A major concern is that troops may get careless by sitting
around. So far, 43 military people have died in accidental deaths
during Operation Desert Shield.
   During a practice run on taking an Iraqi-style trench, Lt. Dean
Shultis of Billings, Mont., offered a six-pack of non-alcoholic
beer to the first machine- gun crew to wipe out a bunker.
   The winners opted for Pepsi instead of near beer, the closest
thing to beer in alcohol-free Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's like kissing your sister,'' said Sgt. Ben Perkins, 23, of
Greeley, Colo.
   When asked about his company's state of preparedness, Perkins
said, ``We're ready to do what we got to do.''
   Troops of the 82nd said they have kept their sharpness three
months after Desert Shield's first ground force arrived.
   ``The only way you lose your edge is if you sit on your butt and
don't train,'' said Sgt. Maj. J. R. Kendall of Bravo Company.
   ``We keep from getting bored by training hard,'' said Kendall,
carrying a shotgun during a trench warfare exercise. ``If the
decision is made to go offensive, these paratroopers are ready.''
   Elements of the 82nd Airborne were the first American ground
forces to arrive in Saudi Arabia after President Bush drew ``a line
in the sand'' on Aug. 7, five days after Iraq's lightning conquest
of Kuwait.
   About 220,000 troops are now in the region and more may be sent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in the life
of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was assassinated in New York:
   Aug. 1, 1932: Martin David Kahane is born in Brooklyn, the son
of a Zionist rabbi who emigrated from Palestine and his Latvian
immigrant wife.
   1946: Joins Betar, a militant Zionist youth group.
   1947: Packs guns for Betar in Hoboken, N.J., and pelts British
Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin with eggs during a demonstration.
Kahane is clubbed by police during that demonstration - his first
fight with police.
   1948: Participates in Zionist demonstrations at United Nations
during debates that end in recognition of the state of Israel.
   1955: Marries his wife, Libby. Around this time, he begins using
his Hebrew name, Meir.
   1956: Obtains degree from New York Law School but either doesn't
take or doesn't pass the bar exam.
   1957: Is ordained an Orthodox rabbi after studying at a yeshiva
in Brooklyn.
   1963: Makes first trip to Israel, serves for three months as a
rabbi on a kibbutz. Soon after his return, he begins writing column
for the Brooklyn-based Jewish Press under the byline Michael King.
   Mid-1960s: Under the King pseudonym, works for various U.S.
government agencies as a researcher and consultant. He works to
marshal support for the Vietnam War, believing widespread Jewish
opposition to the war jeopardized U.S. aid to Israel.
   1966: His alleged mistress, a Christian named Gloria Jean
D'Argenio, jumps to her death from a New York City bridge in
despair over the relationship.
   1968: Through his Jewish Press column, founds the Jewish Defense
League with the slogan ``Never Again.'' The group organizes karate
and weapon training classes for members and patrols high-crime
neighborhoods to protect Jews.
   July 1971: Is fined $5,000 in New York on charges of conspiring
to manufacture explosives.
   September 1971: Emigrates to Israel to organize a JDL faction
there.
   1972: The JDL is linked to the firebombing of the offices of
impresario Sol Hurok, in which one person was killed and 13
injured. But the group drops most of its activities after Kahane
moves its base to Jerusalem.
   1972: Kahane becomes an Israeli citizen, while retaining his
American citizenship.
   1984: Is elected to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, as head of
the Kach (Thus!) Party, which calls for the deportation of all
Arabs.
   1985: Resigns as head of the JDL, in part because he could not
devote enough time to it.
   1985: His American citizenship is revoked on the grounds that he
took a seat in a foreign legislature. He appeals to the U.S. courts
and wins in 1987.
   1988: Renounces his U.S. citizenship to comply with an Israeli
law prohibiting Knesset members from being citizens of other
nations. But later that year, Israel's highest court rules that his
militant anti-Arab Kach Party is racist and therefore ineligible to
participate in parliamentary elections.
   April 1990: Goes on trial in Israel for sedition for calling
Arabs a ``cancer spreading in our midsts'' at a rally protesting a
bloody 1989 attack on Israelis. The case is dropped on a legal
technicality.
   June 1990: Goes back to court in the United States seeking to
win back his U.S. citizenship. The case had been pending.
   September 1990: Goes on trial in Jerusalem on charges of
disturbing public order for leading an anti-Arab rally after the
stabbing deaths of two Israelis in 1989. The next hearing had been
set for December.
   Nov. 5, 1990: Is assassinated by a lone gunman during a Zionist
conference at a New York City hotel.

<HEAD>Presidential Field Cut to 14 With Disqualification Of Duvalierists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The field of presidential
candidates stood at 14 today, with a leftist champion of the poor
favored, after the Electoral Council barred former President Leslie
Manigat and 11 others from running.
   Among those disqualified from the Dec. 16 elections was Dr.
Roger Lafontant, the former chief of the Tonton Macoute militia,
the private army of the brutal Duvalier family dictatorship.
   Lafontant claimed he was wrongfully eliminated and would appeal
to the Supreme Court.
   An outstanding warrant charges Lafontant with conspiring against
national security. The army, long the country's leading political
force, has never served the warrant.
   The Tonton Macoutes terrorized this impoverished Caribbean
nation of 6 million people for 29 years until a popular uprising
forced Jean-Claude Duvalier, son of the late Francois Duvalier,
into exile in 1986.
   But the country has been plagued by political turmoil and
violence ever since. The caretaker government of President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, appointed in March, is the fifth since Duvalier's
ouster.
   Another former Duvalier official disqualified from running for
president was Claude Raymond. The former army chief of staff has
been publicly accused of participating in the massacre of voters
that thwarted 1987 general elections.
   In the massacre, armed thugs in collusion with troops killed at
least 34 people. Twelve Duvalierists had been barred from running
for president in that balloting.
   A new constitution drafted earlier in 1987 barred criminal
supporters of past dictators from running for office until 1997.
   The Electoral Council said the 10 candidates disqualified
Monday, including Lafontant and Raymond, failed to comply with
filing procedures.
   It said Manigat, disqualified Tuesday night, was barred under a
constitutional article that specifies the ``president may not be
re-elected'' unless five years have passed between terms.
   Manigat, who was widely viewed as a puppet of the military,
gained the presidency in a controversial election in January 1988
and was ousted six months later in a coup.
   The council on Tuesday night also disqualified Duvalierist
banker Clemard Joseph Charles, saying he was wanted as a fugitive
in the United States but giving no details.
   The Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a leftist priest, spokesman for
the poor and ardent foe of Haiti's dictatorships, is given the best
chance of winning the Dec. 16 vote - if it is free and fair.
   Dr. Louis Roy, chief of the Council of State that rules
alongside Ms. Pascal-Trouillot, said Aristide's campaign may lose
momentum with Lafontant's disqualification - ``But he remains the
leading contender because he enjoys the backing of the impoverished
masses.''
   Also still in the running are major candidates Marc Bazin, a
former World Bank official; former preacher Silvio Claude, and
businessman Louis Dejoie Jr.
   The council's disqualifications this week were welcomed by many
leading Haitians.
   ``I foresee a relatively normal unfolding of the electoral
process now,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist and
leader of the Congress of Democratic Movements, a socialist party.
   About 800 observers from the United Nations and the Organization
of American States will monitor the vote.

   Voters gave Democrat Joseph R. Biden Jr. a
fourth term in the U.S. Senate and he gave them his gratitude for
ignoring his opponent, a poliical novice and former prosecutor who
campaigned on Biden's mistakes.
   In balloting Tuesday, with 99 percent of precincts reporting,
Biden had 111,191 votes, or 62.5 percent, to Republican M. Jane
Brady's 63,962 votes, or 36 percent.
   Biden thanked voters for ``their willingness to look not only
beyond the negatives, but to examine the distortions and to make
some fundamental judgments about me.''
   Biden, 47, dropped his bid for the 1988 nomination for president
after it was revealed he paraphrased part of a speech by British
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, was accused of improper footnoting
and asked to repeat a course in law school, and exaggerated his
academic record.
   Democrat U.S. Rep. Thomas R. Carper was also re-elected, to a
fifth term.

<HEAD>Lowell Weicker: From Watergate To Connecticut Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a former
Republican senator known as a maverick, maintained that reputation
with his successful bid for governor as an independent.
   ``We didn't ask or bequeath any particular party to run our
business for us,'' Weicker said after his victory. ``We can run it
better than anybody else can.''
   Weicker lost his Senate seat in 1988 when he sought a fourth
term. He said at the time that there would be ``no comebacks.''
   After that defeat, the 59-year-old Greenwich millionaire, whose
grandfather helped found the E.R. Squibb pharmaceutical
corporation, worked for a foundation promoting medical research.
   Then, eight months before Election Day, Weicker announced he
would return to politics as an independent candidate for governor.
   From the beginning, Weicker led Republican John G. Rowland and
Democrat Bruce A. Morrison in public opinion polls, despite the
fact that Connecticut had elected nothing but Republican and
Democratic governors since 1856.
   ``Aside from the fact that we're going to put the state back on
its feet, I hope we send a message that dirt is out of politics in
the state of Connecticut,'' Weicker said, referring to the
often-bitter campaign.
   Weicker's independent attitude was best demonstrated in 1973-74,
when as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee he was one of
President Nixon's most outspoken critics.
   He battled his party at home, too, but was elected and
re-elected, enjoying strong support from Democrats and unaffiliated
voters in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a margin
of about 3-to-2.
   During his 20 years in Washington - 18 in the Senate and two in
the House - Weicker was an advocate for the rights of children, the
handicapped, AIDS patients and the politically oppressed. He was
arrested outside the South African embassy in Washington during an
anti-apartheid protest.
   He faced a serious intraparty challenge for his Senate
nomination in 1982 from Prescott S. Bush Jr., brother of President
Bush. Bush eventually dropped his challenge and Weicker was
narrowly re-elected.
   Six years later, Weicker was upset by then-Attorney General
Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, who won by 10,000 votes - a margin
of less than 1 percent - after a bitter campaign.
   Before being elected to Washington, Weicker served a term as
Greenwich first selectman and two terms in the state House of
Representatives.
   He made a brief bid for the 1980 Republican presidential
nomination.

<HEAD>Florida's Lawton' Chiles, Burned Out Two Years Ago, Is Back in
Spotlight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, Lawton Chiles complained of
``burnout'' - later diagnosed as depression - when he retired after
three terms in the U.S. Senate and 30 years in government.
   On Tuesday, the veteran Democrat roared back into political
life, riding a populist campaign to the governorship of the
nation's fourth-largest state and easily defeating one-term
incumbent Republican Bob Martinez.
   Chiles, 60, who once expressed his frustrations at the inability
of politicians to get things done, invoked the optimistic political
spirit of the early 1960s in his acceptance speech.
   ``Camelot is a state of mind and if you have it and I have it,
we can start bringing Camelot back,'' he told cheering supporters
in Orlando, referring to the nickname admirers gave President
Kennedy's administration.
   For the self-described ``cracker'' from mostly rural Polk
County, the victory was the result of a return to the down-home
political style that first sent him to the Senate in 1970.
   He earned the nickname ``Walkin' Lawton'' when he walked the
length of Florida during that first Senate campaign.
   His comeback bid against Martinez, only the state's second
Republican governor since Reconstruction, was equally unorthodox.
Chiles voluntarily limited individual contributions to $100 each,
allowing Martinez's campaign to outspend him by more than 2-1.
   Limiting contributions, he said, would mean he wouldn't be
beholden to special interests as governor.
   ``What we're saying is the way you campaign tells a lot about
the way you will govern,'' Chiles said.
   The Chiles campaign often seemed almost intentionally
inefficient, disdainful of photo opportunities, live TV news events
and massive rallies.
   Instead, Chiles concentrated on visiting day-care centers,
recycling plants, senior citizens' homes, drug treatment centers
and schools.
   Martinez tried to blunt his opponent's folksy image with charges
that Chiles was really a Washington insider and liberal.
   Slowed by a 1985 quadruple heart bypass operation and depression
tendencies controlled by the drug Prozac, Chiles quit politics in
1988. Republican Connie Mack went on to win his Senate seat in a
razor-thin election over Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay.
   Chiles, with MacKay as his lieutenant governor running mate,
easily won the Democratic primary in April. But then he saw an
early lead over Martinez of up to 30 percentage points evaporate in
the face of the incumbent's well-funded, vigorous re-election
campaign.
   Chiles and MacKay say they will work together like a corporate
team of top executives, and there is wide speculation that Chiles
will step aside after one term so that MacKay can seek the
governorship in 1994.

<HEAD>Miller Used Lottery To Campaign As Familiar Face With New Ideas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Zell Miller, Georgia's lieutenant
governor for 16 years, used a single issue - legalizing state
lotteries - to portray himself in the governor's race as a familiar
face with new ideas.
   Miller, 58, presiding officer of the state Senate, seized the
issue early, championing it unsuccessfully for two years in the
Legislature. Then he employed it to dominate two campaigns this
year.
   First, he used the issue to vanquish four challengers for the
Democratic nomination, including former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
Young's bid to become the state's first black governor brought
international notice to the campaign.
   He pressed the issue again in the general election campaign
against Republican Johnny Isakson, who sought to neutralize
Miller's advantage by endorsing the lottery himself.
   Silver-haired with sharp, hawk-like features, Miller's nasal,
country twang reflects his heritage in the North Georgia mountains.
   The son of an educator, Miller grew up in Young Harris, Ga.,
served a stint in the Marine Corps and then spent three decades in
politics. He has been a state senator, an aide to former Gov.
Lester Maddox, a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, and
lieutenant governor.
   At various times along the way, he has run unsuccessfully for
Congress. In 1980, he lost a bid to unseat then-Sen. Herman
Talmadge in the Democratic primary. Talmadge subsequently lost to a
Republican.
   Some of the sharpest fighting of this year's general election
campaign came when Isakson, seeking to gain the upper hand on the
lottery question, advanced what he termed a better plan for
targeting lottery profits to education.
   Both campaigns, armed with paid media consultants and
professional pollsters in the most expensive campaign in state
history, fired off television commercials arguing whose
distribution formula was best, and argued the issue in person in
several debates.
   Race became an issue late in the campaign, although both
candidates were white.
   During one of several debates, Miller accused Isakson of hiding
behind his father to escape charges that the real estate firm he
heads - previously run by his father - was charged with racial
discrimination in the past.
   Isakson countered that Miller ran a segregationist campaign
during an unsuccessful bid for Congress 26 years ago. Newspaper
clips produced later disclosed Miller condemned then-President
Lyndon Johnson as a turncoat for pressing the landmark Civil Rights
Act of 1964.

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joan Finney has made a career of confounding
pollsters, pundits, legislators and bureaucrats.
   The state treasurer was supposed to lose the Democratic
gubernatorial primary in August to former Gov. John Carlin by as
much as 20 percentage points. She won a narrow victory.
   She defied expectations again Tuesday by winning the general
election.
   Republican Gov. Mike Hayden spent about $2 million in his
re-election campaign, six times as much as Mrs. Finney and the most
ever for a Kansas candidate. President Bush, Vice President Dan
Quayle and first lady Barbara Bush have campaigned for Hayden, as
have other prominent Republicans.
   ``This is a game of hardball,'' Mrs. Finney said before the
election. ``I know I'll have all of the big guns coming out after
me, but I'm used to it.''
   Mrs. Finney, 65, has spent the past 16 years as state treasurer,
winning five elections. In 1985, she created a program of making
idle state funds available for low-interest loans for farmers, and
she has made a crusade out of her office's efforts to find the
owners of unclaimed property.
   But she also has come under fire for her administration.
Repeatedly, state audits criticized her management. Hayden has
pointed to a 1976 incident in which a Topeka boy found a $2 million
state check in an alley - something she blamed on a careless bank
runner.
   Mrs. Finney began her political career in 1953, when she joined
the staff of U.S. Sen. Frank Carlson. Mrs. Finney worked for
Carlson, a revered figure in the Kansas GOP, until he retired in
January 1969.
   ``I didn't want to go on, but after a few months I was back into
it,'' she said. ``It gets into your blood.''
   In 1972, Mrs. Finney began receiving encouragement to run for
the 2nd District seat in the U.S. House. She did and lost the
primary.
   Two years later, Bob Brock, the Topeka hotel magnate and
prominent Democrat, urged her to change parties to run against the
incumbent state treasurer. She thought about it for a month.
   ``All the old Carlson people were retired, so I called Brock and
said, `Let's go!' '' she said.
   That time, she won.
   Mrs. Finney speaks frequently about bringing government back to
the people and has advocated a proposal to amend the state
constitution to allow voters to put laws and amendments on the
ballot without going through the Legislature.
   ``Never overestimate the amount of information people have but
never underestimate their intelligence,'' she has said.

   Democrats strengthened their majority in the
House of Representatives in Tuesday's elections even as voters
tossed out several entrenched incumbents in both parties.
   The majority party wrested 10 seats from the Republicans and
threatened to take four more. GOP candidates captured three
previously Democratic seats and led in another three.
   The Democrats had won 253 seats and were leading in 14 for a
possible majority of 267 - compared to 258 seats going into
Election Day.
   Republicans had won 155 and led in 12. That would give them 167,
compared to their previous 175. There had been two vacancies, one
from each party.
   Voters elected the first socialist to the House since 1929 and
the first black Republican since 1935. Incumbents were turned out
in Missouri, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Oregon, Wisconsin and Vermont. But the re-election
rate for House members still hovered around 96 percent.
   ``Even though a lot of incumbents are not being defeated,
they're being scared,'' said Republican campaign chief Ed Rollins.
``They're not getting the 60 percent margins they had two years
ago.''
   And House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., claimed
victory for the ``fairness'' theme his party had pursued through
the election season.
   ``The results are clear: George Bush cannot win the Congress and
must no longer rule by veto,'' Gephardt said. ``Next year, he must
come to Capitol Hill with an action plan for reviving the economy
and reworking the system to the benefit of working families.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the combative No. 2 House Republican leader,
barely survived his rematch against Democrat David Worley in a
suburban Atlanta district. Gingrich had led the opposition to the
bipartisan budget deal reached by President Bush and Congress.
   In Vermont, freshman incumbent Republican Peter Smith was ousted
in favor of Bernard Sanders, the socialist former mayor of
Burlington. Sanders will become the first socialist in the House
since Victor Louis Berger of Milwaukee, Wis., six decades ago.
   Sanders handily defeated Smith, who had created an awkward
situation when he publicly distanced himself from President Bush
while standing at Bush's side during a presidential trip to Vermont
to stump for the GOP candidate.
   Voters in Connecticut elected the first black Republican to
serve in the House since Oscar De Priest of Illinois during the
Depression. Waterbury Alderman Gary Franks dashed the comeback
hopes of former Democratic Rep. Toby Moffett in a seat vacated by a
Republican.
   For the first time since 1912, the year the Titanic sank, voters
in New Hampshire's 2nd District elected a Democrat. Dick Swett, an
architect, defeated incumbent Republican Chuck Douglas.
   And 32-year veteran Democrat Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin was
defeated by a 37-year-old former Madison newscaster, Scott Klug.
Kastenmeier was chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
courts.
   In Oregon, an incumbent tainted by the savings-and-loan scandal
also went down to defeat. Five-term Rep. Denny Smith was defeated
in his second round with Democrat Mike Kopetski, who had narrowly
lost to Smith two years ago.
   Conservative Republican Stan Parris decisively lost his seat in
the Virginia suburbs of Washington to former Alexandria Mayor James
Moran, who had made Parris' anti-abortion stand a major issue.
   In Florida, Democrat-turned Republican Bill Grant was soundly
defeated by Democrat Pete Peterson, a retired Air Force colonel who
made Grant's 1989 party-switch an issue.
   And Maryland voters evicted five-term Democrat Roy Dyson, who
had been plagued by character questions, choosing instead
Republican Wayne Gilchrest, a high school teacher who has never
held public office.
   In the St. Louis suburbs in Missouri, two-term Republican Jack
Buechner was edged out by Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. Buechner said
he would request a recount in light of the 52-vote victory margin.
   Republicans also lost open-seat races in Utah, Illinois, Rhode
Island, Arkansas and Hawaii, where GOP incumbents had retired or
left to seek higher office.
   In Illinois, John W. Cox Jr. won the seat vacated by Rep. Lynn
Martin, and the traditionally Republican Utah 3rd District went to
a Democrat, Bill Orton.
   In Rhode Island, Democrat John F. Reed defeated Trudy Coxe for
the seat vacated by Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider. In Little
Rock, Ark., former Rep. Ray Thornton succeeded in a comeback bid
against Republican Jim Keet. And there was another comeback in
Hawaii, where Neil Abercrombie recaptured the seat left by Patricia
Saiki.
   And in an affluent suburban Pittsburgh district, attorney Rick
Santorum shocked seven-term Democratic Rep. Doug Walgren by hitting
anti-incumbent themes like the congressional pay raise and
special-interest political money in his campaign.
   A member of the Armed Services Committee, Dyson had barely
survived a challenge by Gilchrest in 1988 when Dyson was hampered
by accusations of conflict-of-interest involving defense contractor
campaign money. This year, it was revealed that Dyson had escaped
service in the Vietnam War by claiming conscientious objector
status - in contrast to his hawkish defense views since entering
the House.
   Several other incumbents were in extremely close races to hang
onto their jobs, including several not previously thought to be in
danger.
   The list included Reps. John Hiler, R-Ind., Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, Chester Atkins, D-Mass., and James McClure Clarke, D-N.C.
   In Kentucky, three-term Rep. Carl Perkins narrowly survived a
scare from Republican Will T. Scott, a former circuit judge, eking
out a 2,000-vote victory.
   Going into Election Day, analysts on both sides were predicting
Republicans would slip further into the minority, losing from six
to 12 seats, despite reported widespread voter disaffection with
the Democrat-controlled Congress.
   Additional GOP losses would further hamper President Bush's
ability to push his legislative agenda through Congress.
   The Democrats have controlled the House since 1954.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he believed the
outcome could help Democrats prevail on closely divided issues,
including some override votes on Bush's vetoes.
   He cited as an example the civil rights bill, which was vetoed
in the waning days of the 101st Congress. The House vote to pass
the bill had been 273 to 154, 17 votes short what would have been
needed to override the president's veto. Foley said the measure
would be pressed again when the 102nd Congress convenes in January.
   A bolstered Democratic majority will also carry a mandate to
undertake ``a serious review of our national health delivery
system,'' Foley said. The change also could affect perennially
close votes on issues such as the budget and abortion.
   Even with the ouster of some incumbents, the re-election rate
appeared to be near the 98 percent rate of the past two elections.
   In Louisiana, New Orleans sent a black Democrat - state Sen.
William Jefferson - to Washington. It was the last majority black
congressional district in the nation still represented by a white.

<HEAD>Dallas Neighborhood Threatening to Secede</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaining of unfinished parks and libraries and
just plain second-class treatment, a section of Dallas comprising
one-third of the city's population is threatening to dissolve an
87-year-old bond and secede.
   Oak Cliff would become Texas' seventh-largest city and reduce
Dallas in area by half if allowed to become independent, as it was
until 1903.
   A referendum to decide the issue could be on the ballot by 1992,
and the new city could be in operation by 1993, the secessionists
say.
   ``If Dallas doesn't change its way of doing business, it will
lose Oak Cliff,'' said Bob McElearney, president of the Oak Cliff
Chamber of Commerce.
   The community on Dallas's south side has 310,000 people, evenly
divided among blacks, whites and Hispanics. It has pockets of
affluence but is largely in decline. The north side of Dallas is
more prosperous.
   ``We don't want to de-annex; we want to improve the quality of
life in the southern half of Dallas,'' said City Councilman Charles
Tandy of Oak Cliff. ``That includes direct city services like trash
pickup, code enforcement, street repairs, things like that.
   ``We have libraries that were promised eight to 10 years ago
that were never built and parks that were initially approved 15
years ago that were never completed.''
   City officials have said budgetary constraints have stopped
projects all over Dallas, not just in Oak Cliff. In addition, they
say, Oak Cliff depends more on libraries and recreation programs
than the north side, where people can afford travel and other
diversions.
   Political underrepresentation has been blamed in part for Oak
Cliff's problems. The community has a third of the population but
only one member on the 12-person City Council. A referendum in
December would reorganize the City Council to address the
disparity.
   The roots of the Dallas-Oak Cliff split are deep. Oak Cliff
joined Dallas by a margin of 18 votes and a decade later secession
already was being discussed.
   On June 1, the secession movement created 19 committees with 130
people to study the possibility of a breakup and its effects. Three
city accountants have been working full-time to analyze projections
on revenue and expenses.
   At a meeting last month where Oak Cliff residents voted
overwhelmingly to proceed with a referendum on secession, Mayor
Annette Strauss was shouted down by a crowd of almost 2,000.
   ``We are one family,'' she pleaded. ``That's the way it's been,
and that's the way it's got to continue to be.''
   Oak Cliff is home to some of Dallas' largest hotels and
warehouses. But 80 percent of city bond money is spent outside Oak
Cliff, said Tandy.
   And Louis Salcedo, an Oak Cliff engineers, said city contracts
have traditionally gone to businesses on the north side. ``It is
easy to drive around Oak Cliff and see areas that have been
neglected,'' he said.
   West Jefferson Boulevard was the former city's downtown section.
But some businesses have closed in the last decade and thrift shops
are now numerous.
   ``I grew up in Oak Cliff and I have seen its condition grow
worse for many years now,'' said Theresa Floyd, who runs a clothing
shop. ``It used to be pretty nice, but now it's going straight
downhill.''
   Other residents aren't sure secession is the right course.
``There are just as many greedy people in Oak Cliff as in Dallas. I
can see taxes going up in Oak Cliff if it becomes a city,'' said Ed
Johnson Crna, an anesthesiologist.

   The Outlaws had made a sizeable dent in the
evening's beer supply by the time Charlie Papazian rose to deliver
the invocation. He raised a glass of frothy ale, grinned through
his beard and led the crowd in the familiar chant:
   ``RELAX! DON'T WORRY! HAVE A HOMEBREW!''
   Up went a hundred glasses and down went the beer.
   Down went Sal Pennacchio's BME Porter, a rich, black ale with a
toasty aroma, and down went John Quinn's Spiced Brown Ale, redolent
of chocolate and cinnamon. Down went a nutty German-style ale and a
malty, golden Pilsener, and down went several other brews that will
never be found at your neighborhood tavern.
   The beers were the star attraction at the annual dinner of the
Outlaws of Homebrew, one of a growing number of clubs around the
nation devoted to home beer brewing. The dinner (the food was
bratwurst and sauerkraut) drew more than 100 people to Brooklyn
Brewery's distribution warehouse on a dark industrial block in
Brooklyn.
   It's estimated that somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million
people in the United States brew their own beer. Homebrewing has
been legal since 1978, and by all accounts is in the midst of a
heady spurt of growth.
   ``I think people are paying more attention to what they're
putting down their mouths,'' said Papazian, whose book, ``The
Complete Joy of Homebrewing,'' is the hobby's bible.
   Membership in the American Homebrewers Association, which
Papazian founded in 1978, is up 41 percent in the past year and is
expected to top 10,000 by year's end. There are at least 150
homebrew clubs in the country and 1,200 retail supply shops.
   ``It's growing tremendously,'' said Seth Schneider, the general
manager of Crosby &amp; Baker, a brewing supply manufacturer and
distributor in Westport, Mass. ``We're still on the steep part of a
growth curve.''
   The growth in homebrewing has mirrored the development of
microbreweries - small breweries that typically devote themselves
to full-bodied, high-quality beers. These beers account for a
microscopic .15 percent of the national market, but loom large in
the world of homebrewers.
   There is a strong symbiotic relationship between homebrewers and
microbrewers. Homebrewers are microbrewers' most loyal customers;
microbrewers frequently sponsor the homebrewers' organizations and
events.
   The Outlaws of Homebrew dinner, for instance, was sponsored by
Brooklyn Brewery, which provided the warehouse and two varieties of
its own beer. Company founder Steve Hindy is himself a homebrewer
who likes to tinker with recipes in his kitchen before trying them
out in the brewery.
   ``Actually, right now I'm brewing something I call a chocolate
stout at home,'' he said.
   The attractions of homebrewing are several. Foremost is the
ability to make good beer; quality has improved mightily in the
past decade as homebrew suppliers have become increasingly
sophisticated.
   ``A homebrew rivals the best beer you've ever had,'' said
Schneider. ``It hasn't traveled, it has more body, it hasn't been
filtered ... and you can make it exactly to your taste.''
   Some of those tastes are exotic - some would say bizarre.
Homebrewers have been known to toss all manner of ingredients into
their brew. Spruce beer, cherry beer and ginger beer are among the
more common of the strange brews.
   Sal Pennacchio, treasurer of the Outlaws of Homebrew, recalls
what happened last November when his wife was about to toss out the
Halloween pumpkin. The result was his Pumpkin Ale, which won third
prize in a national homebrew competition; it tasted, he said,
``just like pumpkin pie.''
   ``I think that's the great thing about homebrewing,'' Pennacchio
said. ``With a little experience, you can create anything you
want.''
   Not everyone wants a Pumpkin Ale, of course, but a more
run-of-the-mill brew is a simple thing to make. Beer essentially
consists of malted barley, yeast, hops and water. With those
ingredients and a few rudimentary pieces of equipment - a bucket,
some plastic tubing, a siphon, an air-lock valve, a capping tool
and caps and bottles - anyone can make beer in their kitchen.
   Equipment for a novice costs about $45. Ingredients for two
cases of beer run about $15, or roughly 35 cents a bottle. But that
can vary widely depending on the kind of beer being made.
   A survey a few years ago by the American Homebrewers Association
found that the overwhelming majority of homebrewers were white
males, somewhat to the chagrin of those who champion the hobby.
Brewers also tend to be married, well educated and divided almost
evenly among cities, suburbs and small towns.
   ``The glibbest generalization,'' said Schneider, ``would be
adult males with facial hair.''
   Beyond that, he said, he's noticed that homebrewers are
frequently computer buffs. Indeed, one of the busiest meeting
places for homebrewers is on CompuServe Information Service's beer
``forum'' - a sort of electronic saloon for personal computer
owners.
   The fact is, brewers are a gregarious lot. They are in their
element at an event like the Outlaws dinner, drinking beer and
swapping brewing notes with abandon.
   ``We're out for a good time,'' said Pennacchio, ``and to have
good beer.''

   Every new, improved product on the supermarket
shelf these days seems to be Greener than Green.
   Environmentally conscious shoppers are being offered more ways
to preserve the planet while stocking up on cleansers, paper
towels, plastic bags or disposable diapers.
   Unfortunately, some of the assertions sprouting on the new
ecology-friendly packages are misleading, confusing or possibly
even fraudulent.
   ``So many of these claims don't mean anything,'' says Joel
Makower, publisher of the monthly Green Consumer Letter.
``Consumers are becoming discouraged early on. I'm afraid we're
losing them before we get them firmly in the green consumer fold.''
   Makower says shoppers who bought supposedly degradable plastic
trash bags were turned off when they learned the bags will not
really decompose in landfills, which is where they are likely to
wind up.
   Similarly, consumers picked up supposedly earth-friendly
aerosols only to find that the ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons
have been replaced by other suspect chemicals. Or they purchased
``recyclable'' plastics, then found no recycler would accept them.
   Much of the confusion about marketing claims may be traceable to
underlying policy questions that have not been settled.
   What is the best way to deal with solid waste? Should we make
biodegradable products, even if they can't be recycled? Push
recycling to the limit, accepting that nothing decomposes in a
landfill anyway? Or reduce packaging to a minimum, even if what's
left is neither recyclable or biodegradable?
   Meanwhile, federal and state investigators are looking into
whether consumers are being deceived by some advertising or
packaging asserting environmental benefits.
   ``We're very concerned with the number of claims that we're
seeing,'' said Julie Vergeront, assistant attorney general in
Minnesota, one of 10 states that formed a task force this year to
work together on cases involving environmental products.
   Seven of the states filed suit against Mobil Corp., saying its
Hefty trash bags, advertised as biodegradable, would not break down
in landfills. The suit has been settled in Texas but is still
pending in the other six states.
   In another case, the maker of Bunnies disposable diapers agreed
to stop claiming the product was biodegradable. The diapers could
degrade under the right circumstances, but not in landfills, which
is where nearly all the diapers end up.
   The manufacturer, American Enviro Products of Placentia, Calif.,
also agreed to redesign the diapers to use thinner plastic and
cotton in place of paper. The new package will say using Bunnies
instead of other disposable diapers saves trees.
   ``They let us off the hook because they thought we were moving
in the right direction environmentally,'' said Robert Chickering,
the company president.
   ``We're going to give up on biodegradability,'' he said - even
though he still believes there may eventually be an environmental
benefit to having degradable wastes in landfills.
   The Federal Trade Commission is pursuing at least a dozen
investigations into environmental product claims, but can't discuss
the details yet, said Barry Cutler, director of its consumer
protection bureau.
   Cutler said the commission was trying to make sure its
enforcement did not give an unfair advantage to paper products over
plastic, or vice-versa.
   To help puzzled shoppers and to verify product claims, two rival
certifying agencies have sprung up.
   The first to begin operations is Green Cross Certification Co.,
based in Oakland, Calif. Since June, it has authorized 60 products
to use its logo with specific statements of environmental virtue.
   Renew brand trash bags, for instance, are certified to contain
at least 80 percent recycled plastics. Clorox 2 bleach comes in a
box which Green Cross has verified was made from 81 percent
recycled paper fibers.
   ``We're very specific with our claims,'' said Stan Rhodes,
president of Green Cross. ``We really need to clean up the
confusion in the marketplace.''
   A competing outfit, Green Seal Inc., is planning more ambitious
endorsements and hoping to announce early next year the first
products that have met its standards.
   ``We're trying to identify products that over their entire life
cycle are better for the environment,'' said Norman Dean, executive
director of Green Seal, which is based in Washington, D.C. ``We
think consumers want to know about the overall impact on the
environment.''
   Cutler said the FTC is watching the environmental certification
groups closely, worried that over-broad endorsements could add to
consumer confusion rather than clear things up.
   Much of the bewilderment, he said, doesn't really stem from
advertising claims or scientific uncertainty but to the unsettled
policy questions.
   ``The real issue is having an environmental policy about the
best way of disposing of solid waste,'' Cutler said. ``The real
issue is what we do with the garbage itself, not what we put on the
box.''

   Fear that politicians are manipulating the throne
for their own ends has arisen again, more than 40 years after
Allied occupation forces rewrote the constitution to prevent it.
   This time, the warnings come from within Japan's own society as
the nation prepares for the coronation Nov. 12 of Emperor Akihito,
the first monarch to be enthroned under that constitution.
   ``I am very worried that the palace is being used for political
purposes just as the military used the late Emperor Showa
(Hirohito) before the war,'' Minoru Hamao, a former imperial
chamberlain, said in an interview.
   Hamao, who directed the education of the Akihito and his sons
for 20 years, said conservatives who would return to the old
imperial system are a minority within the governing Liberal
Democratic Party and lack public support.
   He added, however, that there was increasing evidence of
attempts by politicians ``to align themselves with the emperor
because they feel that will get them prestige and votes.''
   The Chrysanthemum Throne has been politically important
throughout Japanese history, but has had little to do with
day-to-day policy.
   It was used as a justification for their own power by feudal
samurai leaders, political reformers at the turn of the century and
militarists in the years leading up to World War II.
   Today, the Liberal Democrats, who have governed since their
conservative party was formed in 1955, use a logo similar to the
imperial chrysanthemum.
   According to Hamao, links between the palace and party were
relatively weak until Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister in the
mid-1980s, tried to strengthen his control of the Imperial
Household Agency that manages palace affairs.
   ``The Imperial Household Agency is officially under the
supervision of the prime minister's office, and since Nakasone they
have used their control over personnel (appointments) to gain
power,'' Hamao said.
   He expressed particular concern about politicians being involved
in an enthronement rite called the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering
Ritual.
   ``It is very inappropriate for the prime minister and other
government leaders to attend the Daijosai because of its religious
nature,'' Hamao said. ``Having the politicians there is an
imposition, and not in line with the constitution.''
   Hamao said the palace could not have kept politicians off the
guest list, which was strongly influenced by the prime minister's
office.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's government has acknowledged the
religious nature of the Daijosai, in which a new emperor has his
first communion with the gods of Shinto, Japan's state religion
until the war ended.
   It also has described the rite as an ancient tradition and
denied that state funding violates constitutional bans on
government support of religious activities.
   In Hamao's view, the decision to follow prewar precedent for
Akihito's coronation is an attempt to free the government and
Liberal Democrats from constitutional constraints on political
manipulation of the throne.
   If politicians are allowed to ignore those restraints for the
coronation, he said, they may seek to use the emperor in pursuing
their goals.
   Sadao Yamahana, a legislator and and senior member of Japan's
largest opposition party, the Socialists, said he believed the
handling of the coronation reflected a desire by conservatives to
restore some degree of the throne's old status.
   Yamahana said members of his party would not take part in the
Daijosai, ``a rite that is intended to make the emperor closer to a
god.''
   The Japan Federation of Bar Associations, several teachers'
unions and the National Christian Council of Japan have announced
their opposition to state support for the Daijosai.
   In the constitution, written by the U.S.-led occupation
authorities who ran Japan's government for seven years after the
surrender in 1945, the emperor is defined as the ``symbol of the
state and the unity of the people.''
   This largely ceremonial figure was to replace a sovereign called
``sacred and inviolable'' in the imperial charter of 1889.
   ``Most Japanese support the monarchy as it is in the
constitution, but because of memories of the war, we also have
rather complex feelings toward it,'' Yamahana said.
   About 2,500 dignitaries, including Vice President Dan Quayle and
Prince Charles of Britain are expected to attend the main
coronation ceremony.
   While Yamahana acknowledged the need to guard against possible
attacks by leftist radicals, he also said extreme security could be
a means of expanding police powers.
   ``Police are planning what can only be seen as excessive
security, and in this way, too, though subtly, they are saying that
the emperor is not a regular person, he is like a god that needs
special treatment,'' he said.
   Before the war, Yamahana said, the police and government used
such thinking to justify silencing dissent. He added that his
father, a social activist, was arrested dozens of times ``in the
emperor's name.''
   Radicals have declared they will use whatever means available to
disrupt the enthronement, including violence. Tokyo police are
believed to be planning Japan's largest security operation,
possibly involving tens of thousands of officers.
   Two Cabinet ministers have suggested invoking a law that would
allow the government to force violent, anti-social groups to
disband. The law, never used for that purpose, has been criticized
as a threat to freedom of speech and association.
   Political analyst Asao Yamaguchi said he did not expect a
serious effort by Prime Minister Kaifu to use the throne for
political ends.
   ``Really trying to redefine the role of the monarchy would
require a strong political foundation,'' he said. ``Kaifu hasn't
got that.''

<TEXT>
   Excavation has begun on nine buried
sections of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline for corrosion rechecks
after charges the original inspectors were poorly trained or worked
under the influence of drugs or booze.
   In all, 19 sections of the approximately 800-mile line are to be
re-inspected for rust or cracks. A federal criminal investigation,
meanwhile, is under way into accusations by a former corrosion
inspector that his employer ignored drinking and drug use on and
off the job.
   ``The quality of information related to the corrosion repair
work along the pipeline is in question,'' said Mike Mengle, federal
pipeline officer for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
   The 48-inch-diameter line carries a quarter of the nation's
domestic crude oil production from wellhead at Prudhoe Bay to a
marine terminal at the ice-free port of Valdez.
   The renewed concern comes at a time when President Bush has
ordered domestic oil production increased because of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   But state and federal officials won't agree to increase the
pressure in the line until the inspection issues are settled.
   Digging began Friday on a section in the Brooks Range, about 170
miles south of the start of the line at Prudhoe Bay, and the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. hopes to finish the re-inspections by
mid-December. Alyeska is the oil company consortium that operates
the pipeline.
   Initial results Monday from a 76-foot section of pipeline showed
no cracking or corrosion problems, officials said.
   Thorpe Technical Services is the Alyeska contractor that
conducted the original inspection at sites where corrosion or other
problems were suspected. The company has been doing the testing
since 1988.
   State and federal agencies ordered the second look for corrosion
or cracks that could lead to leaks after Edward William Thompson,
26, of Fairbanks, wrote a 16-page letter last month accusing Thorpe
of submitting flawed work.
   Thompson alleged that Thorpe inspectors were poorly trained or
supervised and that drug and alcohol use was widespread among
workers.
   The company denies the allegations.
   Dave Vickery, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management in
Anchorage, confirmed that a criminal investigation was under way
into Thompson's allegations about drug use on federal land. He said
he did not expect a report from investigators until mid-November.
   ``Alcohol and drugs were widespread on the job and after work
hours,'' Thompson said in a telephone interview from Fairbanks. ``I
can't say if that affected their work.
   ``I also wasn't comfortable with the level of training we had. I
had received some schooling - about two weeks' worth - in
ultrasonics. But prior to starting magnetic particle inspection I'd
received no training. I learned on the job.''
   Ultrasonic testing is designed to turn up internal corrosion;
magnetic particle testing is used to find stress cracks, officials
said.
   Thompson claimed in his Oct. 3 letter he never used drugs or
alcohol. But court documents show he was arrested for driving while
intoxicated last year, and in 1985 was convicted of cocaine
possession after failing a drug test at his probation officer's
office.
   Questioned about his criminal record, Thompson responded that
his past is not the issue.
   Dan Claeys, Thorpe vice president for operations, denied
Thompson's accusations about drug and alcohol use and inadequate
training.
   ``We have done random screening since the incident,'' Claeys
said. ``We did it immediately and everything seemed to be in order.
   ``We've also had federal authorities and Alyeska authorities
gather up training documentation to show our people were trained
and competent to do the job,'' he said. ``They have interviewed all
our employees.''
   Alyeska said it expects to spend from $600 million to $800
million by 1993 on corrosion detection and repair.
   The company has inspected about 8,000 feet of pipe above and
below ground, officials said. It has dug up 30-foot to 100-foot
sections at 138 sites to repair corrosion damage by placing steel
sleeves over the original pipe.
   No cracks have been detected, they said.

   They're the folks who tried to tell you Exxon
did a decent job cleaning up the Valdez oil spill, Perrier is safe
to drink again and McDonald's cares as much about the environment
as it does making money.
   What happens when you set 2,500 of them loose on each other for
a four-day annual convention at a posh hotel in Manhattan's theater
district is in itself a metaphor for the public relations industry.
   These experts at putting corporate America's best foot forward
practiced their craft - even when they weren't practicing it at the
convention's beehive of workshops, seminars and speeches.
   They pressed flesh under bright chandeliers, dined together and
swapped tips with colleagues. They honed their flair for
dramatization, bragging about how they helped so-and-so company get
free press in national newspapers.
   Aware of the value of free publicity, many speakers spoke
without charging the Public Relations Society of America, which
organized the event that ends Wednesday.
   PR specialists themselves, society aides armed with
walkie-talkies roamed four floors of the Marriot Marquis, partly to
ensure that visiting reporters were shown the conference's best
face.
   While public relations professionals are among the first layoff
victims during an economic downturn, attendees couldn't resist the
urge to tell reporters their business was performing quite well,
thank you, despite widespread job losses elsewhere.
   The conference's official theme was ``Our World in Transition,''
or how public relations firms can adapt to the changing needs of a
market becoming more global in character.
   But a more timeless notion seemed to dominate as attendees sat
through the clattering of fine silverware at a Monday afternoon
award luncheon: how to balance image-polishing roles with the need
for honesty.
   Several pointed to Perrier's handling last spring of its tainted
water as an example of poor crisis management and insisted that
public pressure eventually forces a company to tell the whole truth
- no matter how well it tries to conceal it.
   After all, it was Perrier's corporate communications department
that initially insisted the discovery of benzene in bottles of the
spring water resulted from a filtering equipment malfunction.
Later, they conceded the carcinogen for years has occurred
naturally in France's underground source for the global drink.
   ``If I tell this lady here that I love her and punch her in the
jaw, she is more likely to believe the punch in the jaw,'' said
Larry Newman, owner of a PR firm in Columbia, S.C., pointing to a
kindly-looking white-haired lady seated nearby.
   ``The truth is always the ceiling above which no amount of
terrific public relations can rise,'' said James E. Arnold,
chairman of the conference and president of a New York consulting
firm.
   On the other hand, many praised McDonald's PR coup last week,
when the fast-food giant announced it would abandon foam packaging
for environmentally friendly paper containers.
   Indeed, PR proponents insisted it is a profession with high
ethics. ``I don't take any clients where I don't believe they are
right or the case for them can't be proven,'' said Newman,
recalling that he didn't take the Shah of Iran in the 1970s because
``I thought the shah was a crumb bum.''
   It became clear at the convention that PR workers consider
themselves a vastly misunderstood bunch bravely trying to earn
respect from the very newspapers and broadcast stations they help
supply news to.
   In their minds, they are crucial links in a complex world,
helping everyone from businesses to non-profit groups communicate
with a doubting American public.
   Indeed, at an event where you'd think nary a disparaging word
could be heard about the industry, at least one workshop, moderated
by Fordham University business school professor William J. Small,
was self-deprecating: ``How to Spend a Billion or Two and Still Get
a Black Eye in Public: The Exxon-Valdez Story.''

   Bart Simpson got the boot in Texas. That's
Bart Simpson the candidate, not Bart Simpson the pint-sized cartoon

   Simpson, a 24-year-old Republican businessman, lost to Democrat
Leticia Van de Putte in the race for state House District 115 for

   But Simpson, whose full first name is Barton, said he always had

   A legislative candidate who proposed
public humiliation for women who have multiple abortions was
defeated. In another race, an incumbent who spoke out in favor of
masturbation won.
   Democratic State Rep. John D. Mordasky on Tuesday beat
Republican challenger Robert Bechta. During the campaign, Bechta
said he supports a woman's right to abortion and supports
state-funded abortions, but doesn't think abortions should be used
as a primary means of birth control.
   ``Public degradation, I think, would probably be the best way''
of deterring people from having multiple abortions, he said.
   Mordasky opposes all abortions, except in cases of rape, incest
or risk to the mother's life.
   In another race, Democratic state Rep. Lynn Taborsak defeated
Republican challenger Alex Nahas, who had criticized her for
proposing legislation encouraging young people to masturbate to
avoid sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.
   ``The Bible says cast your seed into the belly of a whore rather
than onto the ground,'' Nahas said during the campaign.
   Taborsak's measure was intended to counter a Republican
amendment requirng that students be taught abstinence from
premarital sex as the ``expected norm.'' Neither measure became

<HEAD>Heavy Turnout Helps Helms Win Fourth Term</HEAD>

   Sen. Jesse Helms spurred his loyal
supporters to line up at the polls in a plentiful turnout that gave
the conservative Republican a fourth term and vanquished Democratic
challenger Harvey Gantt.
   ``Well, there is no joy in Mudville tonight,'' Helms told
cheering supporters late Tuesday. ``The mighty ultraliberal
establishment, and the liberal politicians and editors and
commentators and columnists have struck out again.''
   With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Helms had 996,082 votes,
or 54 percent, to 865,240 votes, or 46 percent, for Gantt, a former
Charlotte mayor.
   Helms, 69, attributed his victory to an embrace of ``North
Carolina values.'' Gantt, whose supporters hoped to enshrine him as
the first black elected to the Senate from the South since
Reconstruction, ran as an unabashed liberal and attacked what he
called Helms' lying and distortion.
   Gantt, 47, said he did not regret his campaign, which focused on
education, the environment and social issues.
   ``I'm still smiling from way down deep, even though I hurt a
little bit,'' Gantt said. ``I hurt quite a bit because we gave our
best.''
   Voter turnout approached 55 percent, unusually heavy for an
off-year election. ``The Helms campaign got out the people who they
had to get out,'' said Thad Beyle, a political science professor at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   Judges in Durham and Greensboro extended voting hours because of
long lines and problems with voting machines. Other urban areas
also reported long delays at voting places, but did not extend
their hours.
   Helms, who campaigned full-time for only eight days after the
late adjournment of Congress, relied on a barrage of television ads
that raised racial issues. Helms attacked quotas and accused Gantt
of running a ``secret'' campaign on black radio stations.
   Campaign finance reports as of two weeks ago showed Helms had
spent $10.8 million and Gantt $4.6 million, giving North Carolina
the nation's most costly Senate race.
   State voters kept Democrats in control of their legislature,
where incomplete returns showed Republicans in danger of losing
several seats.
   Seven Democrats and three Republicans kept U.S. House seats. In
North Carolina's fickle 11th District, Democratic Rep. James
McClure Clark had 50 percent of the vote in a race too close to
call.

   Money isn't everything, although it certainly
can help, election results show.
   Some candidates who raised and spent millions still lost in
Tuesday's balloting.
   Perhaps most notably, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez lost
re-election in Florida despite raising about $10.6 million to $5.2
million by Democrat Lawton Chiles, the winner.
   Not all the races were costly.
   In Utah, Republican Mary J. Wilder spent $750 to unseat Democrat
Dennis D. Ewing as Tooele County clerk - all but $25 of it her own
money. Ewing, who has held the office for 17 years, spent $1,500.
   The Federal Election Commission reported that more than $350
million was raised and more than $300 million spent by
congressional candidates in the 1990 election.
   Here are recent campaign finance figures in major races for
governor, Senate and House:

   Democrats swept four contested races to
maintain their monopoly on Mississippi's U.S. House delegation.
   Voters on Tuesday also approved six amendments removing
antiquated sections of the state's 100-year-old constitution. Among
the dropped provisions were requirements that state prison inmates
be separated by race and that the governor and treasurer count
state revenues by hand twice a year.
   Voters rejected an amendment that would have repealed the
requirement that each of the state's 82 counties be divided into
five districts.
   U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., won a third term unopposed.
Incumbent Reps. Jamie Whitten, Mike Espy, Mike Parker and Gene
Taylor were big winners. Democratic Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery
was unopposed.
   Whitten, first elected a month before Pearl Harbor, won a 25th
term, while freshman Taylor defeated Shelia Smith, widow of former
Congressman Larkin Smith.

   Democrat Lawton Chiles, ``burned out'' when he
resigned from the U.S. Senate last year, said he regained voters'
trust to oust Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in one of the big prizes
of the 1990 electio60, said he was ``burned out'' when he left the Senate
in 1989, but joined the governor's race last April to start what he
hopes will become a revolution against modern politics.
   ``There really is nothing like success. Politicians like what
works. You might really get some changes,'' he said. Chiles - who
restricted campaign contributions to $100 - raised $5.2 million
with donations from a record 75,000 people.
   Martinez, 55, was only the second Republican governor in Florida
since Reconstruction, and the second to lose a bid for a second
term.
   Martinez's campaign raised $10.6 million. Bush's son Jeb was
Martinez' campaign chairman, the president campaigned for him three
times, and first lady Barbara Bush made a campaign commercial.
   Democrat Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson upset U.S. Rep. James W.
``Bill'' Grant, a recent convert to the GOP who was targeted by the
national Democratic Party for defeat in north Florida's 2nd
District. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Peterson had
101,615 votes, or 57 percent, to Grant's 76,518, or 43 percent.
   Bush also campaigned for Grant.
   The president has been criticized lately for his approval of
higher taxes, but Martinez campaign manager J.M. ``Mac''
Stipanovich said he did not think Bush' support hurt.
   ``The president didn't lose the race for us. We lost it,'' he
said.
   Democrats held off a Republican bid to take control of the state
Senate and will control redistricting in 1992, when Florida is
expected to gain three U.S. House seats. Democrats also control the
state House.
   Voters in the crime-beset state heavily approved a
constitutional amendment mandating a three-day waiting period for
handgun purchases.

   Whether in victory or defeat, to be dignified was the final
challenge.
   So as the returns rolled in, candidates across the nation were
mindful that gracious winners don't gloat and graceful losers never
whine. They stood tall before their boosters and smiled beneath
campaign 1990's last spotlight.
   When the spotlight finally dimmed, today was here. The battle
was done.
   ``You fought nobly,'' Republican Pierre Rinfret said as Gov.
Mario Cuomo breezed to a third term Tuesday. ``We have not seen the
end of each other.''
   Applause sputtered quickly into silence. The controversial
millionaire's staffers hung in when his caustic style split the GOP
and his coffers ran dry, but this was the end of the line.
   Stacks of blue-and-white placards lazed against the walls like
decommissioned soldiers, crumpled soda cans were piled high and
half-eaten bags of chips were already growing stale.
   One campaign worker turns to another: ``So what's next for
you?''
   Before 7 p.m., Rinfret's staffers had pulled on their jackets
and disappeared into the Manhattan night. They couldn't hear
Republican Jim Keet, a 2nd District congressional candidate down in
Arkansas:
   ``Why are you looking so glum? It ain't over 'til it's over,''
Keet reminded his staff at 9:15 p.m. ``You do not have permission
to go home.''
   Their spirits lifted slightly by the pep talk and a late surge
in the polls, the troops stayed on until 11:20 p.m. - when Keet
conceded victory to Democrat Ray Thornton.
   ``Losing is difficult for me,'' Keets said after the race was
called. ``But the political risk is secondary ... Participating in
the American political process is much more important. We will
begin again tomorrow.''
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas sounded a similarly stalwart note in
conceding Democrat Joan Finney's upset victory: ``As tough as it is
and as hard as it is, there'll be another day.''
   Then there was Michael Tobias, a 19-year-old poltiical neophyte
from Portland, Ore. In volunteering to work for GOP Sen. Mark
Hatfield, she signed on with a winning campaign on her first time
out - and it felt good.
   ``It's fun being in politics,'' Ms. Tobias said. ``I'm not sure
what party I'm in, but I'm interested in ... like, maybe becomeing
secretary of state. What's his name?''
   Suddenly whoops go up around the television monitors at
Hatfield's headquarters. Latest returns? Nope. The Portland
Trailblazers just scored against the Los Angeles Lakers. There's
politics, and then there's basketball.
   Of this Sen. Bill Bradley was reminded uncomfortably late in the
game. The Democratic incumbent nearly lost one to the New Jersey
voters.
   ``What can I say? It's been a few years since I was in a double
overtime,'' Bradley said running down Republican opponent Christine
Todd Whitman's early lead.
   Manny Minelli briefly dances the fox trot, then pauses to
reflect. The 65-year-old has over the decades watched his old
friend, Gov. Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island, move from school
council to city council to the statehouse.
   On Tuesday, Democratic challenger Bruce G. Sundlum ended the
Republican governor's three-term reign.
   ``He will be depressed,'' Minelli said. ``Of course he will
be.'' And the band played on, filling a downtown Providence
ballroom with Dixieland jazz and the occasional Gershwin ditty.
   In West Virginia, things were less melancholy. Millionaire Sen.
Jay Rockefeller's $2.7 million campaign staged a party far
different from that hosted by GOP challenger John Yoder, who ran on
a $20,000 budget.
   But the yuks were bipartisan.
   While the incumbent celebrated his victory at a packed reception
room stocked with free munchies and a cash bar, Yoder spent the
night in a $35 motel room off the West Virginia Turnpike.
   Rockefeller supporters watched returns on big-screen TVs. A cash
bar offered mixed drinks at $3 each, wine for $2 and beer for
$1.75. Soft drinks were free. At Yoder's hotel, visitors were
welcome to purchase Smoothies for 50 cents and soft drinks at 55
cents a can.
   ``If I were a Rockefeller, it would not be a cash bar,'' Yoder
said. ``Considering I'm not, it's BYOB for anybody who comes by.''
   But, deadpanned Yoder's wife, ``He's pretty tight even when he
has money.'' A fire raged at the Universal Studios complex not a
mile away, but Republican gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson's
boosters still rolled into campaign central along with favorable
returns against Democratic contender Dianne Feinstein.
   Said candidate Wilson to his supporters: ``Happily, there seems
to be only property damage.''
   Among the clear winners Tuesday evening was Sen. David Pryor of
Arkansas. Minutes after the polls closed, the Democratic incumbent
heaved a sigh of relief in an interview with a Little Rock
television station.
   ``I was very fortunate. The people of our state were very kind
to me this year,'' Pryor said humbly. ``I didn't think this would
happen to me.''
   The two-term senator had no Republican rival.

   Democrat David Walters said his crushing
defeat of Republican Bill Price in the governor's race means
Oklahomans want change, especially in public education.
   ``And ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you, we're going to
change Oklahoma,'' Walters told cheering supporters Tuesday night.
   Democratic Sen. David Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, breezed to a third term, winning over Republican Stephen
Jones. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Boren had 714,976
votes, or 83 percent, to Jones' 143,611, or 17 percent.
   In the governor's race, with 98 percent of precincts reporting,
Walters had 512,691 votes, or 64 percent, to Price's 287,617, or 36
percent.
   Walters, a 38-year-old Oklahoma City businessman, will succeed
Republican Henry Bellmon, who is retiring. Bellmon defeated Walters
in 1986.
   Walters had criticized Price's plan to repeal a $223 million
school reform and tax bill enacted at a special legislative session
this year.
   Walters also was pro-choice, while Price, 42, a former federal
prosecutor from Oklahoma City, took an anti-abortion stand.
   It was the most expensive race ever in Oklahoma. Walters spent
an estimated $2.5 million, a record, and about $1 million more than
Price.
   In the U.S. House, Democrats retained a 4-2 edge over
Republicans, with all incumbents re-elected.

   Bruce King, who has served longer than any
governor in New Mexico history, says on-the-job training won't be
necessary as he returns to the office after an eight-year hiatus.
   A bearlike man known for his friendly, folksy ways, including a
lot of elbow-nudging and back-slapping - usually accompanied by a
``How's it goin'? Fine, fine'' - King has become famous for his
ability to track and follow the political winds.
   ``If you have a problem, I have an open door, and we will work
with you,'' he told campaign audiences.
   The 66-year-old Stanley rancher beat Republican Frank Bond on
Tuesday, earning a third four-year term, with the chance to seek
re-election in 1994.
   He first was elected governor in 1970 and again in 1978, and
holds the record for the longest tenure in the state's top office -
eight years.
   Voters in 1986 approved a state constitutional measure allowing
governors elected from 1990 on to seek a second consecutive term.
Previously, governors could not run for re-election.
   A force in New Mexico politics for most of four decades, King
also has served as a county commissioner and in the Legislature,
where he was elected Speaker of the House.
   Getting along with dissonant interest groups, legislators of
diverse political stripes and bureaucrats of every type is his
forte. Rarely one to challenge political adversaries, he usually
brought them all in to work out a compromise for the benefit of
all.
   As governor, King met regularly with legislative leaders. He has
said he used the Legislature ``very much as a board of directors,
with myself being the CEO.''
   His ability to bring people together also has helped King refine
a difficult tightrope act.
   For example, King often described himself and his lieutenant
governor running mate Casey Luna as the ``businessman team'' that
understands business. However, as governor, King often sided with
labor, twice vetoing right-to-work legislation, which would
prohibit union membership as a condition of employment.
   And as a rancher, King leases public land. Yet he was endorsed
by an environmental coalition, which included some who want to ban
cattle from public land.
   King and his wife of 43 years, Alice, who have two grown sons,
worked side-by-side in the campaign. Mrs. King served as de facto
campaign manager, scheduler and adviser, and King said she would
head a task force in his administration that would study the
state's children and family programs.
   He still lives near his parents' 1917 homestead on the edge of
the Great Plains.

<TEXT>
   After a grueling 18-month gubernatorial
campaign in which she was dogged by personal attacks, Democrat Ann
Richards says she wouldn't be surprised if her own children don't
recognize her.
   Ms. Richards, who on Tuesday overcame millionaire Republican
oilman Clayton Williams, knew what was coming when she ran for
governor of a state where she describes politics as ``a very tough
contact sport.''
   ``I think it's an awful thing for anybody to have to go
through,'' she said during the campaign's final week. ``I had to
tell the kids when we made the decision, `You're not going to
recognize your mother by the time they get through with me.' ''
   Ms. Richards, 57, entered the race after soaring to national
fame as the keynote speaker at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention.
   There, she claimed a lasting reputation with her line about
George Bush's sometimes mangled syntax: ``Poor George. He can't
help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   In the campaign, she found herself recalling her divorce,
talking about her history as a recovering alcoholic, disputing
accusations of drug use and facing attacks that she was a liberal
and defender of gay rights.
   A poll in the fall of 1988 showed more than half of Texas voters
could identify her and only 14 percent didn't like her. A week
before the election, a Gallup Poll put her unfavorable rating at 53
percent.
   Bemoaning the negative tone, she called her race a ``no-win
situation'' and said candidates are afraid to even make a joke for
fear of it becoming front-page news.
   Born and raised near Waco, Ms. Richards received a bachelor's
degree from Baylor University. She was married for 30 years to
civil rights lawyer David Richards. The two were divorced in 1984,
and have four children.
   Her politicking began in the late 1950s, when she volunteered in
the gubernatorial campaign of Henry B. Gonzalez. Ms. Richards first
ran for public office in 1976, winning a seat as a county
commissioner. She won terms as state treasurer in 1982 and 1986.
   Humor always has been an essential ingredient in her politics,
and that was a key reason then-Democratic Party boss Paul Kirk
tapped Ms. Richards to keynote the Atlanta convention.
   Ms. Richards said she still isn't sorry about poking fun at
Bush, although Williams used it against her. Candidates, she said,
must be willing to laugh at themselves.
   ``I wanted that speech to say that this is fun, that politics is
a great thing,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Gov.-elect George Voinovich remembers a
question his late father asked him as he was embarking on his
political career.
   ``Kid, are you sure you want to be a Republican?'' asked the
elder Voinovich, an architect and a Democrat.
   Voinovich supplied that answer long ago and defeated Democrat
Anthony J. Celebrezze on Tuesday.
   ``I don't believe government by itself solves problems,'' he
said. ``But government working with other governmental agencies and
the private sector can solve problems. That was, frankly, my ticket
to success in Cleveland.''
   The 54-year-old Voinovich was mayor of Cleveland for 10 years.
He is credited with leading the city out of default after taking
over from Democrat Dennis Kucinich, who left Cleveland $111 million
in debt, and with helping to revitalize its downtown.
   Voinovich, who cited his experience in Cleveland throughout his
gubernatorial campaign, said he would find ways to cut state
spending through a management audit of state government.
   He said that after eight years of a scandal-plagued Democratic
administration of Gov. Richard Celeste, the state needs to ``work
harder and smarter'' in controlling costs.
   Some state agencies during Celeste's administration were
investigated for awarding state contracts that were
   Snelling, who was governor 1977-85, decided to seek the office
again because he believed his successor, Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a
Democrat, had mismanaged the state's finances. Kunin did not seek a
fourth term.
   With 260 of 262 precincts reporting, Snelling had 106,274 votes,
or 52 percent; Welch had 93,725 votes, or 46 percent.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Democratic Incumbent Governor Wins Second Term in
Landslide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voter interest was low in Pennsylvania, but
those who did turn out favored Democratic incumbent Gov. Robert P.
Casey by a landslide.
   He piled up the largest victory margin ever in a Pennsylvania
gubernatorial race to claim a second term in Tuesday's voting.
   Casey garnered 2,045,464 votes, or 68 percent, compared to
Republican challenger Barbara Hafer's 975,583, or 32 percent.
   He captured 66 of the state's 67 counties, winning in staunch
Republican areas that hadn't supported a Democratic gubernatorial
candidate in this century.
   ``This is a great night,'' Casey told supporters in Scranton,
his hometown. ``A night that defies description.''
   Casey, 58, ran on his record of avoiding new taxes while pushing
education, environmental and economic programs.
   Hafer, 47, the state's auditor general, lagged far behind Casey
in fund raising, and her abortion rights stand hurt her chances of
massing the GOP vote against him.
   With Casey running way ahead throughout the campaign, just 53
percent of registered voters cast ballots in the gubernatorial
race.
   Meanwhile, one incumbent congressman, Democrat Doug Walgren of
Pittsburgh, was ousted, the first time in six years a Pennsylvania
congressman was denied a re-election bid.
   At the state Capitol, Democrats tightened their hold on the
House, boosting their 103-99 margin to 108-95. Republicans' margin
in the Senate dropped from 27-23 to 26-24. A wave of anti-incumbent
sentiment helped unseat 13 state House members.
   Two ballot questions also were approved Tuesday: a $25 million
expansion of loans for volunteer fire and rescue companies and $200
million in state loans for county prison renovations and
expansions.

   Forget counting ballots. At the top of CBS'
election special, Dan Rather began announcing the winners of the
nation's 35 Senate races.
   In shirt-sleeves and suspenders, Rather didn't use the words
``projection'' or ``exit polls.'' He declared ictors.
   Small problem. Some of the polls on the East Coast were still
open. And no bureaucracy, not even CBS, can count that fast.
   Forty minutes into Tuesday's prime-time CBS election special,
Rather finally told viewers that ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN were using a
first-ever, joint venture called Voter Research and Surveys, which
projected all Senate, House and gubernatorial races based on exit
polls.
   CBS did place a tiny ``CBS News Estimates'' in the left-hand
corner of the screen when it moved on to the governors' races
across the country.
   But the premiere of VRS - as those in TV news refer to it -
served only to heighten the networks' preoccupation with providing
instantaneous election results while most of the nation's ballots
are still in boxes.
   Cable News Network, in its comprehensive and ambitious coverage
that lasted six hours, used the word ``estimate.'' NBC and Tom
Brokaw ``called'' races. ABC and Peter Jennings ``projected
winners.''
   On CBS, it was hard to tell what was a prediction and what was a
pronouncement.
   Network election coverage hype was heightened by a ploy to boost
ratings during the November ``sweeps'' period. CBS and NBC said
days before the election that both would carry no commercials
during their special coverage.
   It was not an altruistic move.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. does not include prime-time programs
without advertisements in its ratings. And election specials are
not known for drawing huge audiences.
   Thus, when CBS and NBC affiliate stations set advertising rates
based on the number of November sweeps viewers, neither network
will lose money because of lower election night ratings.
   This, however, did not stop CBS from running in-house ads
promoting shows such as ``Uncle Buck'' and a network premiere of
the movie ``Fatal Attraction.''
   While CNN provided the most up-to-date, detailed coverage of the
country's far-ranging ballot measures and candidates, it was not
immune from the dreaded malady of live news coverage: inane
chatter.
   Bernard Shaw seemed to take a fancy to CNN reporter and former
Texas judge Catherine Crier, who was covering the ugly Lone Star
race for governor between Democrat Ann Richards and Republican
Clayton Williams.
   ``I'd like to sit with you behind the camera and find out what
you really think about that race,'' a smiling Shaw told Crier.
   On CBS, Charles Kuralt chatted with Newsday editorial cartoonist
Doug Marlette about whether it's difficult to draw cartoons when
the nation appears headed for recession with ``war clouds
looming.''
   Rather, in declaring Democrat Joan Finney the upset winner of
the governor's race in Kansas, blurted, ``Hey, Mabel, come in from
the kitchen. Finney wins Kansas.''

<HEAD>Food Tax Issue Leads Utah Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters decided to keep a state sales tax
on food, going along with officials who said the repeal would cost
as much as $90 million in lost revenue.
   The food-tax referendum took center stage after the Independent
Party of Utah gathered 75,000 signatures to place on the ballot a
measure calling for the 6.25 percent tax to be repealed.
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday, 185,465, or 44
percent, voted to repeal the tax; 234,057, or 56 percent, voted to
keep the tax.
   With Gov. Norm Bangerter and other Republicans in opposition,
the measure was given little chance of passage.
   For the U.S. House seat from the conservative 3rd District,
Democratic tax attorney Bill Orton defeated former Republican state
Sen. Karl Snow to replace retiring four-term GOP Rep. Howard
Nielson. With all precincts counted, Orton had 78,431 votes, or 58
percent, to Snow's 50,090, or 37 percent.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, a three-term incumbent, preserved Democratic
representation in the 2nd District.
   It is the first time since 1974 that Utah has had more than one
Democrat among its three congressman.

<HEAD>Republicans Put Their `Spin' on Election Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans who saw their mid-term election
hopes fizzle along with President Bush's promise not to raise taxes
were in no mood to put their feelings on display as voting returns
rolled in.
   In contrast to past elections, the GOP declared Tuesday night's
celebration at its national headquarters off-limits to reporters
and television cameras.
   Also closed to the media was a downtown hotel ballroom where the
National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee was holding its
customary post-election party.
   A small press room was set up one floor above. Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., the committee's chairman, along with a GOP spokesman and
pollster were escorted to the room to put their spin on the
results. But no other mingling was allowed.
   ``Maybe we learned something from 1986,'' said one young GOP
campaign worker, referring to the last mid-term election when
Republicans lost their six-year reign over the Senate.
   With Republican Senate candidates faring better than the party's
gubernatorial and House hopefuls, Nickles was given the task of
being the GOP's main spokesman on the election results.
   ``We got into a real debacle over the budget,'' Nickles said.
``It hurt President Bush; it hurt Republicans. Three or four months
ago, we were hoping to gain two, three or four seats. Right now I
think we'll be satisfied if we can hold our own.''
   Just wait until 1992, he said, when ``we have a lot of senators
in trouble on the Democratic side'' up for re-election.
   Charles Black, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, said the results indicate ``more of an anti-incumbent
trend than a partisan trend,'' a view echoed by Ed Rollins,
co-chairman of the GOP's House campaign committee.
   ``When it's all over, you're going to see four or five
incumbents on our side and four or five incumbents on their side
going down to defeat,'' Rollins said. ``Even though a lot of
incumbents are not being defeated, they're being scared. They're
not getting the 60 percent margins they had two years ago.''
   Anti-incumbency has ranked only slightly behind anti-taxes,
anti-government and anti-spending in recent years as a cause for
Republicans, who have not controlled the House since 1954.
   Asked if an anti-incumbent trend might hurt Bush's re-election
in 1992, Black said, ``it's an anti-Congress trend rather than an
anti-president trend.''

   Here are notable quotes from the election
winners and losers, party officials and others:
   Florida Gov.-elect Lawton Chiles: ``Camelot is a state of mind
and if you have it and I have it, we can start bringing Camelot
back.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.: ``There is no joy in Mudville tonight.
The mighty ultra-liberal establishment, the liberal politicians and
editors and commentators and columnists have struck out again.''
   Democrat Harvey Gantt, who lost to Helms: ``I'm still smiling
from way down deep even though I hurt.''
   Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, a black political think tank: ``We've seen
the triumph of racism over reason in North Carolina.''
   Republican Pete Wilson, who tapped millions of absentee ballots
in California's governor's race: ``We have created a monster. It is
called the absentee vote. It's the right kind of monster to have.''
   Texas Gov.-elect Ann Richards: ``They want a governor that gets
up and goes to work every morning.''
   Minnesota Independent-Republican Arne Carlson: ``I feel like
Lazarus tonight.'' Carlson was on the gubernatorial ballot only
because Jon Grunseth dropped out in late October over allegations
of sexual improprieties.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown: ``If the
election for president were tonight, George Bush would lose.''
   Richard Viguerie, a right-wing Republican fund-raiser: ``It's a
wake-up call for George Bush and the country club Republicans who
populate the White House.''
   Retiring Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, head of the Democratic
Governors' Association: ``To the degree that George Bush was a
factor, he was a burden.''
   Republican National Committee spokesman Charles Black: ``It
appears to be more of an anti-incumbent trend than a partisan
trend.''
   House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt: ``The results are clear:
George Bush cannot win the Congress and must no longer rule by
veto.''
   Ed Rollins of the National Republican Congressional Committee:
``Even though a lot of incumbents are not being defeated, they're
being scared. They're not getting the 60 percent margins they had
two years ago.''
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., who lost to Democrat James Moran: ``In
1974 I got run over by a train called Watergate. Now it very much
appears the same train 16 years later is going to run over me
again.''
   Democrat Joe Grandmaison, who lost to Republican Gov. Judd Gregg
in New Hampshire: ``The truth of the matter is, I ran against a
very popular incumbent governor who had more money than God to
spend.''
   Republican Rep. Bob Smith, who defeated Democrat John Durkin in
New Hampshire's open Senate race: ``I'm a common man with common
sense. I share common values with a lot of common people.''
   Gov.-elect Lowell Weicker: ``I hope we sent a message that dirt
is out of politics in the state of Connecticut.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.: ``The harder the fight, the sweeter
the win.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.: ``Today in Massachusetts, we have
proven that money can't buy you a U.S. Senate seat.''
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, whose hard-core anti-abortion stand cost
him heavily in his losing his bid to unseat Sen. Tom Harkin: ``We
presented to the people of Iowa a real choice. We didn't waffle.''
   Democrat Joan Finney, the first woman ever elected governor in
Kansas, referring to her husband, Spencer: ``We're going to put his
picture in Cedar Crest with the first ladies.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today, while Tokyo share prices fell further as the Middle East
situation discouraged investors, traders said.
   The dollar closed at 127.55 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's
127.20-yen finish, but down from 128.15 yen in New York on Tuesday.
It opened at 128.10 yen and ranged between 127.30 yen and 128.50
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 465.50
points, or 1.94 percent, closing at 23,500.25. The benchmark index
lost 419.58 points Tuesday.
   The dollar, boosted by a rise on overseas markets, opened
stronger then fell on profit-taking, said Kohei Kuroda, an analyst
with Fuji Bank.
   ``The U.S. elections (Tuesday) little affected the market,''
Kuroda said, as initial reports indicated moderate gains for the
Democrats.
   Some market players had said an unexpected victory by the
Republicans might trigger a rush to buy dollars.
   Spot transactions totaled $12.646 billion, up from Tuesday's
$11.251 billion.
   On the stock market, lingering worries over the Middle East
situation discouraged buying, said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a dealer
with Daiwa Securities.
   ``A wait-and-see attitude prevailed because of concerns about
the Persian Gulf crisis and a quarterly bond auction in the United
States later this week,'' Nishiguchi said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Nikkei index has fallen
6,744,93 points, or 22.3 percent.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 330 million shares,
up from 295 million shares Tuesday.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers 816 to 176, while 94 others
remained unchanged.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds were
quoted at 84.59 points, down from Tuesday's 84.77-point finish.
Their yield was 7.800, up from 7.755.
   Dubai crude oil for December delivery was valued at $27.45 to
$27.55 a barrel, unchanged from late Tuesday's levels in New York.

<HEAD>Democrat Cuomo Captures Third Term; Republicans Hold State Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo walked away with a third term
but not without a few blisters that could make it uncomfortable to
break into a run for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Cuomo failed to lead Democrats to control of the state Senate in
Tuesday's election, and he lost his battle for approval of a $2
billion environmental bond act. Cuomo also fell far short of the 65
percent of the vote he racked up four years ago.
   ``This guy gets 52, 53 percent of the vote and he's going to be
a presidential contender?'' state GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett
said. ``Mario Cuomo ran against himself and lost.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Cuomo had 2,097,394
votes, or 53 percent; Republican Pierre Rinfret had 850,764 votes,
or 21 percent; and Conservative Party challenger Herbert London had
814,036 votes, or 21 percent.
   At Cuomo's victory party early today, about 250 AIDS activists
from the group ACT UP staged a raucous protest that delayed and cut
short the governor's acceptance speech.
   ``What these people are proving is that this is a very hard time
to govern,'' Cuomo said to supporters. ``But with your help, we're
going to do it better the next four years than it's ever been done
before.''
   Rinfret, a millionaire economist who had demonstrated an ability
to insult Republicans almost as often as Democrats, made no public
appearance after suffering the worst defeat in state history for a
Republican gubernatorial candidate.
   Barrett said London's strong showing pointed up a need for the
Republican Party to ``get back together (and) restore our
historical conservative base.''
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion, said Cuomo was hurt by having to announce that the
state faced a potential budget deficit of $824 million despite his
approval earlier this year of a record $1.8 billion tax increase
package.
   However, all of New York's 34 U.S. House members, 21 Democrats
and 13 Republicans, were re-elected.
   On Staten Island, voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to
start a process that could lead to secession for the smallest of
New York City's five boroughs.

   Democratic Sen. Max Baucus said he prepared
for a tough race, but ended up with a pushover, downing Republican
Allen Kolstad by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
   With 92 percent of precincts reporting, Baucus had 201,489
votes, or 70 percent. Kolstad, Montana's lieutenant governor, had
85,787, or 30 percent.
   Baucus returns to Washington for his third term. He said he
focused his campaign on convincing voters he was working to lessen
unemployment.
   Kolstad said he ran a hard, honest campaign but was outgunned by
Baucus' $3 million campaign fund. Kolstad also castigated Baucus
for running a deceptive campaign.
   Meanwhile, Montana voters on Tuesday defeated an initiative that
would have increased cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack. Voters
also re-elected the state's incumbent congressmen - one Democrat
and one Republican.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts voters were in the mood for change,
but not enough to adopt what would have been the biggest
voter-initiated state tax rollback in history.
   Bay Staters rejected the multi-billion-dollar measure Tuesday,
apparently satisfied with ousting incumbents and relying on new
officeholders to carry out their mandate.
   One political analyst said the tax rollback was too dramatic,
even for the frustrated and cash-strapped Massachusetts electorate.
   ``They wanted change but (the measure) went too far,''
University of Massachusetts political scientist Paul Watanabe said
after the election.
   Crafted by Citizens for Limited Taxation in response to four tax
increases in the past two years, it was defeated 60 percent to 40
percent, with 85 percent of the precincts reporting.
   The measure called for cutting state taxes and fees to 1988
levels. It would have slashed $1.3 billion from the state's $13.4
billion budget in the second half of the current fiscal year, and
cut $2.6 billion in fiscal 1992, which begins next July.
   Recent increases in the state income, sales and gas taxes would
have been rescinded.
   ``After a decade in which the public was told to feel good in
the Reagan years, and to feel angry by talk-show hosts, the voters
decided to speak for themselves and recognize reality,'' said James
Braude, the initiative's leading opponent.
   He and other opponents had argued the measure could almost shut
down the state, which raised fees in recent years as it tried to
keep pace with a failing economy and cover the costs of an
escalating budget.
   ``I'm mad but I'm not crazy,'' was the slogan of the
initiative's opponents.
   Said Barbara Anderson, executive director of Citizens for
Limited Taxation, ``It was a great fight and we certainly made them
work for every penny they're going to take from us.''
   The financially ailing Massachusetts government has the lowest
state bond rating in the country. Bond rating agencies warned that
passage of the measure could drop the state's rating from its
current level of Baa to junk bond status.

   Freshman U.S. Rep. Jolene Unsoeld fought for her
job in an election with an unusual twist. The campaign was fought
over gun control, an issue on which both candidates seemingly
agreed.
   Unsoeld, a Democratic protege of House Speaker Tom Foley, was
challenged Tuesday by conservative Republican Bob Williams, a
former state legislator, for the 3rd District seat.
   With 56 percent of precincts reporting, Unsoeld had 38,520
votes, or 53 percent, to 34,205 votes, or 47 percent, for Williams.
   Unsoeld, a gun-control advocate in the Legislature, was rapped
for championing a key amendment sought by the National Rifle
Association and later accepting campaign cash from the group.
Otherwise, the race was a classic contest between liberal and
conservative.
   Foley easily won re-election, and the rest of the House
delegation was heavily favored. An Unsoeld victory would leave the
delegation at five Democrats and three Republicans.
   Washington voters rejected a slow-growth initiative. Seattle
voters approved continuing to allow city government workers to take
sick leave to care for live-in partners, and Tacoma residents
considered a gay-rights ordinance.

<TEXT>
   Guy Hunt, Alabama's first Republican
governor in more than a century, narrowly won re-election despite a
virtual sweep of top state offices by Democrats and Democratic U.S.
Sen. Howell Heflin's big margin.
   Hunt, a preacher and farmer who blended folksy appeal with a
hard-hitting campaign, turned back the challenge of state teachers'
union leader Paul Hubbert in Tuesday's vote.
   Hubbert delayed any concession speech until today, saying there
remained the possibility of error in the unofficial count.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, the unofficial tally
showed Hunt with 619,108 votes, or 52 percent, to Hubbert's 574,213
votes, or 48 percent.
   Heflin, chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and a frequent
swing vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, won a third term over
Republican Bill Cabaniss.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Heflin had 697,458
votes, or 61 percent, to Cabaniss' 454,298 votes, or 39 percent.
   Democrats won every statewide office on the ballot and
maintained their 5-2 edge in congressional seats.
   The 57-year-old Hunt, who first was elected in 1986, won by
splitting most of the rural vote with Hubbert and building solid
leads in urban centers around Birmingham and Huntsville.
   Hunt's victory made him the only person other than George C.
Wallace to win successive four-year terms as governor of Alabama.
   ``I think it shows the power of incumbency and Hunt's own
personal appeal,'' said University of Alabama political analyst
Patrick Cotter.
   Hubbert, 54, who was making his first run for statewide public
office, said his strong challenge showed Alabama is ``ready to join
the ranks of the New South.''

<TEXT>
   At least 20 villagers were killed, scores
injured and more than 12,000 left homeless by a powerful earthquake
that jolted a mountainous region of southern Iran, Tehran's
official media reported today.
   They reported a dozen villages damaged, two of them completely
destroyed, in the temblor in Fars province on Tuesday night.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said 21 people were killed, 80
injured and 12,105 rendered homeless. Tehran Radio said 22 were
killed and 100 injured.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said most of the victims were
children who were sleeping when the quake struck at 9:47 p.m.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said initial readings put the
magnitude of the quake at 7.0 on the Richter scale. Iran's
Geophysics Center of Tehran University said it measured 6.6.
   An earthquake of that magnitude is capable of widespread, heavy
damage. A quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck northern
Iran on June 21, killing about 50,000 people and rendering half a
million people homeless.
   Tuesday's quake was centered near the city of Darab about 600
miles southeast of Tehran, IRNA said. It quoted Darab Gov. Yahya
Hashemi as saying at least 12 villages were heavily damaged.
   Two of the villages, IRNA said, were razed. It identified them
as Qareh-No and Do-Borj-E Fourk, both in the Fourk county, which
have a combined population of just over 6,300 people.
   IRNA reported a series of aftershocks well after the earthquake,
including a powerful one that hit this morning and measured 5.6 on
the Richter scale.
   IRNA said helicopters, ambulances, fire engines and civil
defense teams were dispatched to the area. The rescuers, it said,
worked all night in search of victims. The helicopters lifted
blankets and tents to the area, and flew casualties to hospitals.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani dispatched Vice President Hamid
Mirzadeh to the region after allocating $13 million to the stricken
area.
   Mohammad Parham, the head of Iran's Red Crescent, the Moslem
equivalent of the Red Cross, also flew to Fars to supervise relief
operations.
   Alireza Jafarzadeh, the Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for The
People's Mujahedeen of Iran, said information from the area
indicated the quake hit the route that connects Darab with the port
city of Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz.
   Jafarzadeh, whose group seeks to overthrow the Islamic
government in Tehran, said ``This is a mountainous area.''
   He said, ``the casualties are high because it occurred late at
night when most villagers are at home, so that's real
unfortunate.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An increase of one number on the scale means a 10-fold
increase in ground motion.

<TEXT>
   David Walters may have defeated his GOP
gubernatorial opponent, but he hasn't seen the last of him: Walters
is fending off a libel lawsuit filed by his foe.
   Republican Bill Price filed the suit after Walters alleged he
was involved in oil price gouging.
   Walters, who chopped cotton on the family farm as a boy before
going on to earn a Harvard education, first ran for the state's top
office in 1986, showing promise by upsetting front-runner Mike
Turpen, then the state's attorney general, in the primary.
   It was his first run for political office, but the Oklahoma City
businessman quickly made points with his campaign energy and
mastery of political rhetoric.
   Walters' primary victory then was tarnished by questions over
the legality of a $162,500 loan from five people who already had
contributed the maximum $5,000 allowed by law.
   Controversy over the loan was a major factor in Republican Henry
Bellmon's defeat of Walters in 1986 and was the subject of negative
television ads by Price in this year's elections. Bellmon is
retiring.
   Walters countered with his own allegations, including those of
oil price gouging.
   Walters, 38, relied heavily on voter dissatisfaction with
government in overcoming his own negatives. He raised more than
$2.3 million, a record, for the campaign.
   He defeated two strong contenders in the Democratic primary:
seven-term U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins and sitting House Speaker Steve
Lewis. As in 1986, he hammered on the theme that he was an outsider
battling career politicians, calling himself a businessman who
wanted to bring a fresh approach to government.
   Walters was associate provost at the University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center, located only a few blocks from the Capitol,
before he quit to go into private business a few years before his
first race for governor.
   In the runoff campaign with Watkins, Walters repeatedly ran
television ads supporting a proposal to make Oklahoma the first
state in the nation to limit legislative terms.
   He won a close runoff race with Watkins, and the legislative
tenure plan was adopted overwhelmingly.
   Walters was born and raised in Canute, a small community in
southwestern Oklahoma. He and his wife, Rhonda, have four children.

<HEAD>Ann Richards Says Money, Bush's Help Failed to Help in Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ann Richards, who roared from 15 points
behind in the polls only six weeks ago to capture the governor's
mansion, derided Republican Clayton Williams' millions and the help
he got from President Bush.
   ``I've always believed in people politics more than money
politics,'' the Democratic state treasurer said after becoming the
first woman to win a Texas governor's race since Miriam ``Ma''
Ferguson in 1932.
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Richards received 1,862,705
to 1,756,634 for Williams, or 51 percent to 49 percent.
   The victory for the 57-year-old Richards was a major
embarrassment to Bush, who calls Texas home and campaigned with
Williams all day Monday.
   Texas voters gave Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm a second term.
With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Gramm had 2,161,422 votes,
or 61 percent, to 1,360,731 votes, or 39 percent, for his
Democratic opponent, state Sen. Hugh Parmer of Fort Worth.
Democrats retained 19 of the state's 27 seats in the U.S. House.
   A jubilant Richards held aloft a T-shirt that said, ``A woman's
place is in the dome'' as her supporters cheered Tuesday night.
   She said the vote showed that average Texans didn't want another
millionaire as governor. Millionaire incumbent Bill Clements, a
Republican, is retiring.
   ``They want a governor that gets up and goes to work every
morning,'' she said. ``They want a governor that isn't going to be
distracted by other business. They want their children educated ...
They want something done about their insurance rates, and they want
a governor that's going to do that.''
   Richards also said her abortion rights position was
well-received by voters.
   ``They want a governor who is committed to the freedom of the
people of this state and who is not going to allow government to
interfere in their private lives,'' she said.
   Williams, who spent $8 million of his own money on the race that
cost him over $20 million total, hushed supporters who booed at
Richards' name.
   ``To Ann Richards and to those who voted for her and worked long
and hard and ably for her, I say congratulations,'' he said.
   In defeat, Williams acknowledged his various verbal gaffes
throughout the campaign and the resultant damage.
   ``The fact that I didn't win is no reflection on the values that
we believe in,'' he said. ``Maybe I'm a little too open, maybe
straightforward.''
   Besides setting a spending record, their race also gained
national notoriety for mudslinging.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, found herself dogged by
questions about drug use after refusing in the primary to answer
``yes'' or ``no'' to a debate question on whether she had ever used
illegal drugs.
   Williams' problems stemmed from his gaffes. He was sharply
criticized after likening bad weather to rape and joking that if it
were inevitable, ``just relax and enjoy it.''
   He also admitted visiting prostitutes as a youth, saying that's
how young men got ``serviced.''
   When told that Ms. Richards had said she was catching up,
Williams cracked: ``I hope she didn't go back to drinking again.''

<TEXT>
   Hank Brown's methodical rise to the Senate befits
his image as a competent, easygoing and articulate man who has
represented Colorado's agricultural flatlands in Congress for the
past decade.
   Brown, a Republican, cruised by Democrat Josie Heath of Boulder
on Tuesday, a victory expected ever since he announced in 1989 that
he would seek the Senate seat being left vacant by Republican Sen.
Bill Armstrong, who retired.
   During his campaign against Heath, Brown enhanced his reputation
as a campaigner, projecting an unflappable demeanor in public.
   Brown, 50, a fifth-generation Coloradan from Greeley, had
represented Colorado's mainly agricultural eastern plains in
Congress since 1980, winning 70 percent or more of the vote in each
outing.
   He came to the job with an agricultural background of sorts,
having worked for a meatpacker, Monfort of Colorado Inc., from 1969
to 1980. He was a vice president during his later years there.
   While serving on the House Ways and Means Committee, Brown
became one of the most effective Republican critics of a welfare
reform package backed by committee Democrats. He is credited with
getting the House to endorse a version that produced the workfare
reform that was signed into law in 1988.
   Brown sought tougher child support enforcement mecha said, summing
up his political creed and
campaign theme.
   Cut spending, hold the line on taxes, ensure a strong national
defense and execute the most heinous of criminals - those have been
the hallmarks of Craig's five-term congressional career.
   They were also the theme of the campaign that earned Craig the
seat of retiring GOP Sen. James McClure over Democrat Ron Twilegar.
   Republicans have held it for 40 years.
   ``I've never voted to raise your taxes, and I'm not about to
start,'' Craig told voters throughout the campaign. He stood firmly
against President Bush and the budget deficit packages the
administration backed because they included higher taxes.
   He is perhaps best known for sponsoring a proposed balanced
budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
   Craig, 45, is Idaho's third straight 1st District congressman to
join the Senate. McClure held that House seat for three terms
before winning a heated 1972 campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Len
Jordan.
   Conservative Steve Symms took over the district in 1972 and then
passed the mantle to Craig eight years later when he defeated
longtime Democratic Sen. Frank Church in 1980.
   Craig attended the University of Idaho, where he was student
body president and a champion debater, and later worked on the
family's Midvale ranch in western Idaho's Middle Valley while he
polished his Republican credentials.
   In 1974, at 29, he began a political career that has yet to be
tarnished by defeat at the polls. He was elected to the first of
three terms in the state Senate, serving part of that time with
Twilegar.
   He was generally viewed as moderate by his colleagues in the
Legislature. His move to the right began with his decision to run
for Congress in 1980.
   A relatively low-profile lawmaker on the national scene, Craig
was never really challenged at the polls. His last three
re-election campaigns produced two-thirds majorities. Democrats
lost two of their challengers to fatal accidents.
   During his congressional service, Craig has run up high ratings
from conservative groups and low assessments from most
environmental organizations.
   A man of modest means, Craig saw an investment in a Boise
doughnut shop go sour early in his congressional career. During the
agricultural depression of the mid-1980s, his family ranch was
forced into farm bankruptcy and eventually old.
   Seven years ago, he married Suzanne Scott, and the couple has
three children from his wife's previous marriage.

   Maryland's Democratic incumbent dispatched a
Republican husband-wife team, but the GOP gained a congressional
seat.
   The ticket of Gov. William Donald Schaefer on Tuesday topped
Republicans William Shepard and his wife Lois, who ran for governor
and lieutenant governor.
   With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Schaefer had 593,101
votes, or 61 percent, to 382,418, or 39 percent, for Shepard.
   Republican Wayne Gilchrest, a school teacher and part-time house
painter, ousted incumbent U.S. Rep. Roy Dyson, who was hurt by
lingering ethical questions concerning campaign contributions from
defense lobbyists.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Gilchrest led the five-term
Democrat 56 percent to 44 percent.
   The other House incumbents, five Democrats and two Republicans,
were easily re-elected.

   Republicans were swamped by Democrats as
millionaire businessman Bruce G. Sundlun dumped incumbent Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete and the Legislature lost its GOP leadership.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell held off Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider
as Democrats captured every statewide race but one, with freshman
GOP Rep. Ronald K. Machtley winning re-election.
   The election night parties staged by the two parties were
studies in contrast. Democrats were festive and numerous;
Republicans were sedate.
   Many of the Democratic victories were by wide margins. With all
but three precincts reporting, Sundlun wiped up DiPrete 74 percent
to 26 percent. The challenger had 255,495 votes to DiPrete's
87,961.
   ``The voters obviously have been very supportive and have heard
our message,'' Sundlun said Tuesday night.
   DiPrete said his party faces a difficult, but attainable,
challenge. ``We've built it up beore, we'll build it up again,''
he said.
   With all but three precincts counted, Pell outpolled Miss
Schneider 62 percent to 38 percent. The incumbent had 216,253
votes, Scheider tallied 133,552. Democratic state Sen. John F. Reed
tallied 59 percent to Republican Trudy Coxe's 41 percent.
   With all precincts reporting, Machtley beat Democrat Scott Wolf
55 percent to 45 percent.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert D. Goldberg of South Kingstown was
beaten by Democrat Walter J. Gray - by a 142-vote margin. In the
House, the minority leader's spot was vacated and the No. 2
Republican, Minority Whip Arthur M. Read II of Barrington, was
trounced by Democrat Sandra M. Barone, 60 percent to 31 percent.

   Voters ousted two Republican governors
associated with tax hikes and nearly threw out a senator to show
their fury at a governor who recently raised their taxes but was
not on the balot this year.
   If they sent a clear message on tax matters, voters were less
definitive on abortion. Pro-choice stands helped some candidates
and proved irrelevant in other cases, and top targets of abortion
rights groups lived to serve another term.
   In other trends, widespread public dissatisfaction with Congress
translated into only a handful of surprise defeats. And though
voters rated the Persian Gulf standoff one of the most important
issues facing them and the country, it did not influence contests
one way or another.
   ``It's the forgotten issue,'' said Frank Newport,
editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll. ``But looking ahead, something
is going to happen there and that's going to set the agenda for the
months to come. Even if nothing happens and our troops just sit
there, it's a very significant issue that may dwarf the others.''
   The overriding themes in Tuesday's races were economic. Taxes in
particular were at issue in Florida and Kansas, where Democratic
gubernatorial challengers won at least in part by tying the
incumbents to tax increases.
   Some said the chickens of the past decade came home to roost on
people who were not at fault.
   ``The real reason this is happening to the governors has got to
be traced to the Reagan administration,'' said Benjamin Page, a
public opinion expert at Northwestern University. ``The cuts in
federal aid to the states put tremendous pressure on finances and
that's why these people have been raising taxes without adding
services.
   ``We're having the morning after,'' he said. ``We're having our
hangover.''
   One near-casualty of the anti-tax revolt was Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., thought to be popular and heavily favored yet barely
holding his seat. Most analysts blamed his problems on Democratic
Gov. Jim Florio, who was elected last year and promptly raised
taxes.
   ``New Jersey is a real solid example of what happens with people
who try to raise taxes,'' said Newport. He said state executives
are taking the hit now and ``you can extrapolate and say President
Bush raised taxes, where will he end up in 1992? We're going to
poll on that.''
   In the sagging economic climate of New England, retirements and
challenges resulted in an almost complete turnover in governor's
mansions.
   And in another variation on economic concerns, Democrats in
Texas and Florida made effective use of a populist pitch fueled by
Bush's waffling on whether to raise taxes on the rich.
   ``You've got a resurgence of the Democratic fairness theme and
the notion that the Republican Party has served the interests of
the well-to-do,'' said Bruce Buchanan, an analyst at the University
of Texas. ``People are tired of it.''
   In Texas, he said, Democrats swept all major statewide offices.
And in Florida, winning challenger Lawton Chiles exploited ``the
idea of taking the power back to the people, away from the elements
of privilege and big money,'' Buchanan said.
   Chiles also benefited somewhat from his pro-choice abortion
stand, as did Jim Moran, a Virginia Democrat who unseated Rep. Stan
Parris. But being pro-choice didn't help Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden or
North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, both of whom lost.
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., survived though he was a top target of
abortion rights forces, and Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus won another
term after vetoing a restrictive abortion bill and enduring the
wrath of the anti-abortion movement. And voters in Iowa delivered a
mixed verdict, re-electing a pro-choice senator and an
anti-abortion governor.
   ``Where abortion was a fundamental issue, it cut for the
pro-choice candidate,'' said analyst Larry Sabato of the University
of Virginia. ``But where other issues took precedence, then
pro-life candidates were able to win. In Iowa, lots of people voted
simultaneously (for both candidates) so obviously abortion was not
the motivator.''
   A poll taken Election Day found voters giving Congress an 18
percent approval rating. But the discontent translated largely into
unexpectedly close races for some incumbents - and not actual
losses except in a very few cases.
   ``The voters wanted to send a message without killing the
messengers,'' Sabato said. ``The re-elect percentages are down. A
lot of incumbents have been given scares.''

Gregg had 172,886 votes, 64 percent, to 99,014, 36 percent, for
Grandmaison.
   Durkin, a senator from 1975-80, focused his campaign on Smith's
acceptance of more than $500,000 in campaign contributions from
political action committees.
   But he wound up apologizing for using the racial slur ``Japs''
in attacking a $350,000 ad campaign against him that was funded by
a Japanaese automobile PAC.
   In other races, retiring U.S. Sen Gordon Humphrey won a seat in
the state Senate and innkeeper Bill Zeliff, a Republican and
protege of former Gov. John Sununu, won Smith's open House seat.
   Dick Swett, 33, an architect and political newcomer, became the
first Democrat elected in the 2nd Congressional District since
former President Theodore Roosevelt split the GOP vote with his
``Bull Moose'' party in 1912. Swett defeated freshman Republican
Chuck Douglas 75,802 votes, 53 percent, to 66,764, 47 percent, with
all votes counted.

<HEAD>Peacetime Army Healthy Alternative to Civilian Life, Study
Suggests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If you can stay out of battle, the Army can be a
pretty healthy way of life.
   Military researchers found that soldiers died at half the rate
of their civilian counterparts during the peacetime year of 1986.
   The lead researcher, Joseph M. Rothberg, a mathematician in
military psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, said
the most important factor in the difference is the screening of
Army enlistees, all of whom are volunteers, have high school
degrees and are healthy enough to pass a physical.
   The Army also provides housing, food, meaningful work and ``lots
of fresh air and exercise,'' as well as controlling substance abuse
and regulating firearms, Rothberg said in a telephone interview
Tuesday from Bethesda, Md.
   Further study is needed to determine how much of a contribution
to longevity is made by exercise and by recently introduced Army
programs in nutrition, smoking reduction and stress reduction, the
reserachers said.
   The researchers compared death rates among all 781,000 Army
troops and civilian counterparts of the same age, race and sex in
1986.
   The study, reported in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, did not give actual death rates. But Rothberg said in
an interview that soldiers overall died at a rate of 109 per
100,000, while comparable civilians died at a rate of 215 per
100,000.
   Sam Sarkesian, a political science professor at Loyola
University in Chicago, objected that figures from a peacetime yaer
like 1986 fail to reflect the dangers of serving a nation that goes
to war about every 10 years.
   He added that being a soldier still means ``you have to be ready
to give up your life.''
   Even in non-war years, military personnel die violently, such as
in the 1983 Beirut bombing, when 237 were killed; in the 1985
Gander, Newfoundland, plane crash, when 248 died, and in the 1989
Panama invasion, when 23 died.
   ``From 1945 on, if you'd put all those together and compare it
to the equivalent in civilian life, I think you'd get a totally
different picture,'' Sarkesian said.
   In the military study, the greatest disparity in death rates
involved homicides, which were almost six times less common among
soldiers. Deaths by disease or suicide were also lower.
   The most striking difference was among black men, who died in
homicides almost 12 times less often in the Army than in the
population at large.
   The homicide rate among black male soldiers was nine per
100,000, compared with 100 per 100,000 for black male civilians,
Rothberg said.
   Army women, who make up 10.2 percent of soldiers, died at about
three-quarters the rate of civilian women of the same age overall.
   Black women soldiers died at 39 percent the rate of comparable
civilians. But white women soldiers died at 139 percent the rate of
white women civilians.

   U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. says his
landslide re-election has him thinking about another run for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter and all nine incumbent U.S.
representatives - three Republicans and six Democrats - also were
re-elected. Among those returned to the U.S. House was Democrat
Harold Ford, who is under indictment on charges he sold political
influence to two crooked bankers.
   ``Now that it's over, I'll sit down and think about running, but
I don't have any plans,'' said Gore, who sought the nomination in
1988. ``I haven't ruled it out at all.''
   With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Gore had 528,196 votes,
or 68 percent, to Republican William Hawkins' 229,792, or 30
percent. Hawkins, a freelance writer, did almost no campaigning.
   Also with 100 percent reporting, McWherter had 474,653 votes, or
61 percent, to Republican Dwight Henry's 286,694, or 37 percent.
   The GOP's heavy funding of state legislative races paid off,
apparently netting them the largest number of Senate seats in state
history.
   Two races were still undecided early today, but it appeared
there would be 19 Democrats and 14 Republicans in the state Senate.
   In the House, Republicans won six seats from Democrats, but lost
five that had been held by the GOP.

<HEAD>Hickel Finds Following on Fourth Comeback Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wally Hickel has tried to get back to the
governor's mansion ever since he moved out in mid-term more than
two decades ago. On his fourth long-shot attempt, he succeeded.
   Entering the race just hours before the deadline on a
third-party ticket, the conservative Hickel was condemned by some
Republicans as a spoiler. But the self-described ``independent
Republican'' attracted a following that by late October had pushed
him ahead of his Republican and Democratic rivals in the polls.
   Hickel, 71, had to attract support from a large percentage of
voters who were children or not even born when he was at his
political zenith.
   While his campaign slogan was ``For a Bright Future,'' Hickel
often cited achievements from two decades ago and spoke longingly
of restoring Alaska's ``lost spirit.''
   Hickel associates call him an energetic man of limitless
optimism and belief in his own abilities.
   ``I'm not one to study things to death,'' he said. ``I get
things done.''
   He arrived in Anchorage in late 1940, a boxer from Kansas with
37 cents in his pocket, as he tells it. He went on to make a
fortune in construction and real estate, and his holdings now
include hotels and shopping centers.
   In 1966, Hickel defeated Democratic Gov. Bill Egan to become
Alaska's second governor. During his two years in Juneau he
approved construction of an ice road from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay
that allowed expanded oil exploration on Alaska's North Slope. When
summer turned the road to mud, it became known as ``Hickel's
Ditch.''
   President Nixon called Hickel to Washington, D.C., as Interior
Secretary in 1968, three days before the Santa Barbara oil spill.
After initial criticism, Hickel won praise for writing regulations
to control offshore drilling and make the oil industry financially
liable for well blowouts.
   Nixon fired Hickel in 1970 in response, Hickel says, to industry
pressure. Hickel also had written Nixon a letter chiding him for
failing to listen to America's youth protesting the Vietnam war.
   In 1974, Hickel ran for governor but lost the GOP primary to Jay
Hammond. He tried again in 1978 and lost to Hammond by 98 votes.
Hickel then ran a write-in campaign as an independent in the
general election and lost.
   In 1986, Hickel ran again but lost the Republican primary to
Arliss Sturgulewski. Hickel supporters promoted him as a write-in
candidate in the general election; he got less than 3 percent of
the vote.
   This year, Hickel headed the Alaskan Independence Party ticket.
His campaign stressed independence from the federal government,
reduced state spending and protecting the family.
   Hickel is married and has six grown children.

   Former Gov. Walter Hickel, a
tough-talking conservative, swept past the two major party
candidates to recapture the statehouse as an independent.
   ``I think Alaskans just want a change - they want to have more
of a say in government,'' Hickel said after voting Tuesday. ``It's
sort of an anti-government feeling out there.''
   Republican Sen. Ted Stevens had no trouble defeating Democratic
businessman Michael Beasley.
   With 83 percent of the vote counted, Hickel had 46,799 votes, or
38 percent, to 39,150, or 32 percent, for Democrat Tony Knowles.
Republican Arliss Sturgulewski was third with 31,649 votes, or 26
percent.
   With 83 percent of the precincts reporting in the Senate race,
Stevens had 78,941, or 66 percent, to 38,615, or 32 percent for
Beasley.
   Alaskans also approved a referendum making the private use of
marijuana a crime once again. With 89 percent of the precincts
reporting, the measure passed by 75,829 votes, or 55 percent, to
62,942, or 45 votes.
   Hickel, 71, is a longtime Republican who was elected the state's
second governor in 1966. He entered the race just six weeks ago on
the Alaskan Independence Party ticket and quickly passed the major
party candidates in the polls.
   His victory is believed to mark the first time in American
history that two independent governors have been elected at the
same time. Former Connecticut Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was
elected governor there Tuesday as an independent.
   ``Those people that voted for us, thank God. Those people that
didn't, we'll welcome them. Let's build a great Alaska,'' Hickel
said in a victory speech.
   Sturgulewski she her campaign was hurt by Hickel's entry into
the race.
   ``I feel we've run a wonderful campaign with wonderful people
around the state,'' she said. ``But I do think it's unfortunate
that we had someone come in at the last minute with a lot of money
and who's not subject to public scrutiny.''
   Hickel supporters said he offered the only conservative
alternative to the moderate Sturgulewski and to Knowles.

<TEXT>
   In a nation of people who complain about taxes, a funny thing
happened Tuesday when voters got a chance to change the laws.
Mostly, they didn't.
   Down went a $2.6 billion tax rollback in Massachusetts, which
would have been the largest voter-initiated state tax cut in the
nation's history. Down went a 2 percent limit on annual state and
local budget increases in Nebraska.
   Montanans refused to scrap their state income, property and
sales taxes in favor of a ``transaction charge'' of 1 percent on
all financial dealings. Neither backers nor opponents seemed sure
whether it would have raised or lowered taxes.
   And Colorado voters narrowly rejected a measure requiring voter
approval for any state or local tax increase. A similar proposal
was soundly defeated in 1988.
   An exception to the trend appeared in Oregon, which passed a
limit on property taxes of 1.5 percent of assessed value. The
measure would cut property taxes by almost 50 percent.
   In unofficial returns today from 82 percent of the precincts, 52
percent voted for the Oregon measure.
   Don McIntire, chief proponent of the new limit, said he thinks
Oregonians are frustrated with state government's inability to
tackle the property tax question.
   ``People are realizing the political system is paralyzed,''
McIntire said. ``They (state leaders) just can't deal with this
subject responsibly.''
   But John Marshall of the Oregon School Boards Association warned
that school programs face ``major amputation'' as a result of the
vote.
   The Massachusetts measure would have shrunk state taxes and fees
to 1988 levels. It would have slashed $1.3 billion from the state
budget in the second half of the current fiscal year and $2.6
billion in the fiscal year starting next July. The state's current
budget is $13.4 billion.
   It also would have rescinded recent increases in the state
income, sales and gas taxes.
   Opponents had charged that the cuts would hamper such state
services as day care, elderly programs, and police and firefighter
training. Officials said the measure could shut down college
campuses and bankrupt some school districts.
   One political analyst said the tax rollback was too dramatic,
even for the frustrated and cash-strapped Massachusetts electorate.
   ``They wanted change but (the petition) went too far,'' said
University of Massachusetts political scientist Paul Watanabe.
   James Braude, the leading opponent of the initiative, said,
``After a decade in which the public was told to feel good in the
Reagan years, and to feel angry by talk show hosts, the voters
decided to speak for themselves and recognize reality.''
   Californians rejected two measures that would have increased the
state tax on alcohol. In Utah, voters refused to abolish the state
sales tax on food.
   Although Montanans preserved their income, property and sales
taxes, they decided in another vote to put the lid on. They snuffed
out a measure to boost the state cigarette tax 140 percent to 43
cents a pack, the highest in the nation - a device that had been
expected to cut tobacco consumption.

   Republican Pete Wilson clung to a narrow lead
over Democrat Dianne Feinstein early today in the California
governor's race, and the Big Green environmental initiative was
defeated.
   A proposal that would throw every current member of the state
Legislature out of office before the decade's end led by a narrow
majority, and two propositions to raise alcohol taxes lost by
substantial margins.
   Wilson, a U.S. senator, led Feinstein, a former San Francisco
mayor, by about 58,000 votes out of 5.8 million counted. Some 2
million more votes, including about 500,000 absentee ballots, still
remained to be counted.
   With 87 percent of California's 26,060 precincts reporting,
Wilson led Feinstein, 2,953,854 to 2,896,178, or 48 percent to 47
percent. Minor party candidates divided the remainder.
   Proposition 128, dubbed the Big Green initiative, trailed with
35 percent voting yes and 65 percent no.
   Penny-a-drink and nickel-a-drink alcohol tax propositions were
both defeated; 58 percent opposed the former and 69 percent the
latter.
   A strong anti-tax, anti-spending tide swept through other ballot
measures. Twelve of 14 bond statewide bond issues and seven of 12
county sales tax hike proposals were trailing. Three of four Santa
Clara County proposals to raise local utilities taxes to finance a
stadium to lure baseball's San Francisco Giants to Santa Clara also
were trailing.
   Proposition 140, the more drastic of the two anti-incumbent term
limit initiatives on the Tuesday ballot, was leading with 52
percent of the vote, and the more moderate Proposition 131 term
limits initiative was defeated by a 3-2 margin.
   With 82 percent of the votes counted in the hotly contested race
for attorney general, Democrat Arlo Smith led Republican Dan
Lungren, 2,627,123 to 2,509,998, or 48 percent to 45 percent.
   Incumbent Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy defeated Republican
state Sen. Marian Bergeson, 3,008,556 to 2,325,391, or 53 percent
to 41 percent.
   A key issue in the race for governor was which party would
occupy the office when new congressional and legislative district
lines for 1992 are drawn. That's when California's congressional
delegation expands from the current 45 to 52 or more seats.
   Democrats have controlled the Legislature for 20 years, and
Republicans felt their only hope to prevent a Democratic
gerrymander of those districts was the threat of a GOP governor's
veto.
   Big Green was a sweeping plan to phase out cancer-causing
pesticides, ban chemicals that harm the ozone, and reduce emissions
of gases that contribute to global warming.
   It was supported by every major environmental group in the
state, but was opposed by water, timber, agricultural and
manufacturing groups and tracked closely by business groups
nationwide as another potential California trend-setting political
movement.

   Voters rejected Republican challenger
Sheffield Nelson's campaign argument that 10 years was enough and
re-elected Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton to a fifth term.
   In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Democrat David Pryor easily
turned back his independent write-in opponent. Pryor has been a
senator since 1979.
   Anti-incumbent sentiment wasn't much in evidence in Arkansas
congressional races either. Office-holders were easy winners in
three congressional districts, and a former congressman was elected
in a fourth district.
   With 94 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton had 368,610
votes, or 57 percent. Nelson had 275,056 votes, or 43 percent.
   The incumbent did surprisingly well in several
Republican-dominated counties.
   ``I have been astonished with the votes in western Arkansas in
those big Republican counties,'' Clinton said.
   ``They just had us outmanned,'' Nelson said. ``I don't think it
would have made any difference who was against him.''
   The win gives Clinton another four-year term, which if completed
would make him the state's longest-serving governor at 14 years.
Orval Faubus served 12 years.
   In the Senate race with 89 percent of precints reporting, Pryor
had 393,265 votes, or 99 percent. Independent write-in candidate
Betty White had 2,755 votes.
   Voters also passed a bill to strip from the state's constitution
a relic of its racist past. Amendment 3, which would repeal a 1956
anti-desegregation statute, passed with 51 percent of the vote.

   Neighbors described the alleged assassin of
Rabbi Meir Kahane as a devout Moslem who showed no interest in Arab
political activity.
   ``It's a surprise to us, to everybody,'' said Debra Ragab, 39,
of Jersey City, N.J., where the suspect, El-Sayyid A. Nosair, a
34-year-old Egyption immigrant who repaired air conditioners for
the city of New York, lived until recently.
   The FBI, New York City and Bergen County police on Tuesday
removed a file cabinet, several boxes and a target drawn on
sheetrock from Nosair's house in Cliffside, N.J., where he has
lived for the past six months, authorities said.
   Nosair, who was charged with murder, was in serious condition
today at Bellevue Hospital. He was shot while fleeing the scene of
Kahane's shooting.
   Kahane, an anti-Arab extremist whose political party was
outlawed as racist in Israel, was shot to death Monday night after
a speech to a Zionist group at a New York City hotel. He was the
founder of the radical Jewish Defense League.
   Ragab, who grew up with Nosair's American wife in Pennsylvania,
said Caren Nosair called her after hearing about the shooting on
the news.
   ``She's devastated,'' said Ragab. ``She had no idea this was
going to happen. ... She doesn't know what happened, why it
happened.''
   Born in Port Said, Egypt, Nosair entered ,146 votes, or 13 percent.
   In the Senate race, Hatfield captured 466,551 votes, or 53
percent, to Lonsdale's 407,691, or 47 percent.
   Republican Rep. Denny Smith was defeated by Democrat Mike
Kopetski in his bid for a sixth term in Congress.
   Voters rejected measures to close the Trojan nuclear plant in
northwestern Oregon and give tax credits to parents who send their
children to private schools. They approved a measure to limit
property taxes to 1.5 percent of assessed value.
   Democrats retained their majority in the state Senate, but
appeared to be losing control of the House. Unofficial results
indicated Republicans would control the House 32-28.
   Lonsdale, who largely bankrolled his own campaign, had led in
some October polls after criticizing Hatfield as a Washington
insider who had allowed overcutting of Oregon's old growth forests.
   But Hatfield, who has never lost an election since voters first
sent him to the Oregon Legislature in 1950, launched a strong
counterattack on Lonsdale in the final weeks of the campaign.
   ``In the last few weeks we've been tough as nails when we had to
be, but we were always truthful,'' he said.

   U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond and Gov. Carroll
Campbell were easily re-elected, but upset victories by two other
Republicans had state GOP officials rejoicing today.
   ``Yesterday was a historic day for the Republican Party,'' said
Tony Denny, executive director of the South Carolina Republican
party.
   Thurmond, 87, the Senate's oldest member, easily beat back a
challenge by Democrat Robert Cunningham, while Campbell trounced
state Sen. Theo Mitchell to win a second term.
   Republican Barbara Nielsen won an upset victory over Education
Superintendent Charlie Williams, a 12-year incumbent, and Jim Miles
ousted three-term Democratic Secretary of State John Campbell.
   Overall, however, Democrats held their more than 2-1 edge in the
state House, which had 48 of its 124 seats up for re-election. Only
three of the 40 incumbent state House members lost re-election
bids.
   Thurmond, first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954, had 473,097
votes, or 66 percent, to 240,453 votes, or 34 percent, for Robert
Cunningham, a retired CIA official, with 98 percent of the
precincts reporting.
   Campbell got 495,876 votes, or 70 percent, to 197,107, or 28
percent, for Mitchell, who was trying to become the state's first
black governor.
   He pledged to use the mandate to push for government reforms
during his second four-year term.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's an overwhelming victory,''
Campbell said. ``It's certainly more than we anticipated that we
might have gotten.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vanquished gubernatorial hopeful John Silber said
voters weren't angry with his blunt remarks but with incumbent Gov.
Michael Dukakis when they chose their first Republican governor in
20 years.
   Voters in overwhelmingly Democratic Massachusetts preferred
mild-mannered former federal prosecutor William Weld to Silber, a
Democrat but conservative in many ways, by 51 percent to 49 percent
on Tuesday.
   Silber, whose fiery nature had become a major issue in the race,
blamed his defeat on the withering of the Massachusetts economic
``miracle'' that Dukakis had touted during his futile presidential
bid in 1988.
   ``I think there was a very anti-Democratic spirit running in
this state,'' said Silber. With 90 percent of precincts reporting,
Weld had 1,027,184 votes to Silber's 972,050.
   But Democrats won other closely watched races: Sen. John Kerry,
a former lieutenant governor under Dukakis, won a second term
solidly, as did U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, reprimanded by the House
earlier this year for his activities with a male prostitute.
   Voters elected a Republican state treasurer, Joe Malone, to
succeed Democrat Robert Q. Crane, retiring after 26 years. And the
state's sole GOP congressman, Silvio Conte, won re-election easily.
   But none of six Democratic congressmen in contested races was
repudiated. Four other Democratic incumbents ran unopposed.
   In the Senate race, with 90 percent of precincts reporting,
Kerry had 1,155,686 votes, or 57 percent, to 866,828 votes, or 43
percent, for James Rappaport, a Republican mutimillionaire
businessman.
   ``Twenty-five years ago some of us my age jumped around to a
song with the title `Money Can't Buy Me Love' and today in
Massachusetts we have proven that money can't buy you a United
States Senate seat,'' Kerry said in his victory speech.
   The results of the governor's race buoyed state Republicans,
outnumbered 3-1 by Democrats among registered voters. There are
several thousand more independents than Democrats, however.
   By a 3-2 margin, voters rejected a $1.2 billion tax rollback
that Weld had supported and Silber opposed.
   ``I don't believe government should be in the miracle business.
I believe government should do a very few things, but do them
well,'' Weld said.
   During his primary campaign, Silber, on leave as Boston
University president, uttered a series of blunt statements - dubbed
``Silber shockers'' - on women, immigrants and welfare mothers.
   His tone was quieter in the general election campaign, though he
tried to attack Weld's image as a wealthy descendant of Boston's
old ruling class.
   Weld replied that Silber lacked the temperament to govern.
Silber frequently complained he was quoted out of context.
   Both candidates tried to appeal to both right and left.
   Weld, 45, a former U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, stressed his
progressive views on social issues, including abortion, and
conservative fiscal beliefs.
   Silber, 64, a philosophy scholar from Texas and BU president
since 1970, acknowledged voting for President Bush over Dukakis in
1988 and blamed Dukakis for the state's fiscal mess.

   North Dakota's newly elected labor
commissioner was the first Republican to snatch an office from a
Democrat since 1980, but the Republican challenger to U.S. Rep.
Byron Dorgan couldn't accomplish that feat.
   Dorgan, first elected to the House in 1980, has regularly rolled
up more than 70 percent of the vote against Republican challengers.
He beat Ed Schafer Tuesday to win his sixth term.
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Dorgan had 142,268
votes, or 65 percent, to Schafer's 76,083, or 35 percent.
   Voters rejected eight ballot measures, including an initiative
to make insurance rebating legal and three proposals to allow
privately run gambling for the first time in state history.
   In state office races, Craig Hagen also made history as North
Dakota's youngest labor commissioner. He is 25, the legal minimum
for the office.
   Hagen succeeds Democrat Byron Knutson, who failed to qualify in
the June primary to run for a second term. Hagen defeated S.F.
``Buckshot'' Hoffner, 66, a former state legislator.

   Jewish leaders condemned the assassination of
Rabbi Meir Kahane while taking pains to distance themselves from
his extreme anti-Arab views and support of violence.
   ``We always condemned Kahane and the anti-Arab racist views he
espoused,'' said Arden E. Shenker, head of the National Jewish
Community Relations Advisory Council. ``We nevertheless are shocked
by this cold act of political violence.''
   Kahane, founder of the radical Jewish Defense League and a
former member of Israel's Parliament, was shot to death Monday
after a speech to a Zionist group at a New York hotel. His alleged
assassin, a naturalized Egyptian, was shot and wounded.
   Followers of Kahane vowed revenge on Tuesday. Arab spokesmen and
mainstream Jewish leaders counseled against further violence.
   ``I hope this is just hyperbole, more rhetoric,'' Dr. M.T.
Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committee, said of
the threats of reprisals.
   ``This is not the time to be speaking of revenge,'' said Rabbi
Marc D. Angel, president of the Rabbinical Council of America. ``It
is the time to be speaking of peace and reconciliation. This cycle
of violence must be ended.''
   Mehdi said he had debated Kahane numerous times and found him to
be honest, courageous and decent - despite Mehdi's beating by JDL
members in 1974.
   ``We disagreed 100 percent with his basic assumptions, which was
that God has given Palestine to the Jews,'' he said. ``But now I
feel the attack upon him is not only an attack upon Rabbi Meir
Kahane, but also an attack on the First Amendment.''
   ``It is an endeavor to shut up a voice, a disagreeable voice,''
Mehdi said, ``and we have condemned the alleged assassin, whoever
he is.''
   Zaheer Uddin, president of the New York unit of the Islamic
Circle of North America, condemned the assassination and said, ``We
hope that it will be the last act in the cycle of violence and
counterviolence.''
   Sholom D. Comay, president of the American Jewish Committee,
said, ``Despite our considerable differences, Meir Kahane must
always be remembered for the slogan `Never Again,' which for so
many became the battle cry of post-Holocaust Jewry.''

<HEAD>Environmental Movement Suffers Blow with `Big Green' Defeat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environmental movement suffered a blow at
the polls on Tuesday, led by the firm defeat of California's
sweeping ``Big Green'' initiative.
   ``Big Green'' would have stiffened regulation of emissions,
pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and logging. It trailed by a
margin of about 2 to 1 as late results came in early today.
   California voters also appeared to be rejecting
environmentalists' Proposition 130, ``Forests Forever,'' a ban on
clear-cutting of forests. Two industry countermeasures to ``Big
Green'' and ``Forests Forever'' were soundly rejected.
   From the Pacific Northwest to Missouri to New York, other
environmentalist-backed measures also were voted down.
   ``Big Green'' would have provided $300 million in bond funds to
buy and preserve ancient redwood forests, tried to slow global
warming by curbing auto and other emissions, banned oil development
in state waters, and barred pesticides suspected of causing cancer.
It would also have created an elected post of environmental czar.
   ``I don't think that anybody who voted against `Big Green' voted
for polluted air or cancer-causing chemicals,'' Sierra Club
official Bob Hattoy said. Voters apparently were swayed by
broadcast commercials paid for by oil and chemical companies, he
said.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a primary sponsor
of the measure, said voters were conservative when it came to
spending money on new programs because ``of a confluence of
events.''
   ``I think the invasion of Kuwait, the beginning of the
recession, the national budget crisis, the state budget crisis -
all those things have scared people,'' he said.
   Proponents, who spent $4.5 million to boost the initiative, said
it would have saved Californians several billion dollars a year in
energy and health costs.
   Corporations, including major oil companies based outside the
state, spent $10 million in a campaign condemning the measure as a
potential economic disaster. Foes said the controls would have
increased gas, electricity and food prices while falling short of
environmental cleanup goals.
   Elsewhere, two environmental measures did pass. South Dakotans
approved an initiative requiring legislative approval for
large-scale garbage dumps. And Arizonans voted to spend $20 million
a year in state lottery receipts on wildlife habitat protection,
parks, trails and other environmental endeavors.
   But these environmental measures were defeated:
   -A Washington initiative to create regional boards to oversee
and enforce land-use planning at the local and regional levels.
   -An Oregon initiative to require recycling standards for all
food and product packaging.
   -A Missouri initiative to protect 52 natural waterways, mainly
in the Ozarks, by banning new dams and restricting landfills and
dumping, septic tanks and structures near the waterways.
   -A limitation on large-scale gold or silver mining in the Black
Hills of South Dakota.
   -A $1.975 billion bond issue in New York to be used for
environmental protection.

<TEXT>
   Police early today released about 50
Saudi women they detained for a daring protest - driving their
normally chauffered cars around Riyadh to demand that they be given
the right to take the wheel.
   The women, many supported by their husbands, called Tuesday's
unprecedented protest a practical matter, saying any Saudi
involvement in a Persian Gulf war could leave them without male
drivers for their luxury sedans.
   ``This has nothing whatsoever to do with politics,'' one said.
``If a crisis erupts, we must drive for the sake of our families.
We cannot stay immobile like sitting ducks.''
   The protest was a startling act of defiance in this
conservative, male-dominated Moslem country. Under Saudi Arabia's
strict Islamic code, women cannot drive, mingle with men in public
or expose their skin to public view.
   Many women in the kingdom speculate, however, that Saudi Arabia
could finally be ready to make some tentative first steps toward
allowing women greater freedoms. They think the arrival of tens of
thousands of women drivers among Kuwaiti refugees and in the U.S.
military could help spur such change.
   Tuesday's women drivers, many of them completely veiled except
for their eyes, piled into 15 cars and took a 30-minute drive
through the capital.
   All the women who took part were experienced drivers, having
learned the skill outside of Saudi Arabia. They included
businesswomen, houswives and a woman who was eight months pregnant.
   They met in a supermarket parking lot and revved their engines
in excitement just as the meuzzin's call signaled the end of the
afternoon prayer.
   Husbands, brothers, and a crowd of Filipino drivers stood
watching with open admiration.
   Passing motorists stared in disbelief as the women drove
expertly down Riyadh's highways. Most of the women previously had
only rode in the back seats of their cars, which usually are driven
by foreign chaffeurs.
   Some people joined the convoy and pulled over to the side of the
road after 30 minutes when the women were finally stopped by the
police, who blocked observers trying to speak with the women.
   ``We don't know what will happen next,'' said a woman in one of
the cars. ``This is just the first little bit of freedom.''
   They parked in row alongside the road for several hours until
the policemen drove the women's cars to a police station.
   The women said the episode ended at 4 a.m. today when they were
all released to the custody of their relatives.
   ``We didn't like it, but there was no alternative,'' one woman
said. Like others interviewed, she spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The women's closest male relatives were summoned to the station
to witness as they signed a statement that the protest would not be
repeated, participants in the demonstation said.
   The driving ban has been a topic of heated debate, with
conservative citizens arguing that the Islamic prohibition against
men and women mingling in public included women drivers.
   Others have pointed out that women were allowed to lead camels
in the era of Prophet Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic faith,
so modern women should be able to drive cars. Having a chauffeur,
especially a foreigner, was a form of mingling with strange men,
they point out.
   One informed source told AP that the women had written a letter
to Riyadh governor Prince Salman bin Abdel-Aziz informing him that
the ``drive-in'' protest would take place, but not revealing the
date or place.
   With the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis, King Fahd had
instituted a program opening the way for Saudi women to volunteer
for nursing and first aid.

   Jubilant feminists say Ann Richards' triumph
in the hard-fought Texas gubernatorial race shatters a ``glass
ceiling'' for women candidates.
   Joan Finney captured the governor's mansion in Kansas and
Barbara Roberts triumphed in Oregon's statehouse race. But Dianne
Feinstein lost a very close race in California and women went down
to a string of senatorial defeats.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr was losing to Democrat Ben Nelson in her
re-election bid.
   The results were mixed, too, for black candidates. The most
prominent, Democrat Harvey Gantt, suffered a stinging defeat at the
hands of Sen. Jesse Helms in a racially charged contest in North
Carolina.
   But in Connecticut, black conservative Garry Franks won election
to the House, the first black Republican to serve there since
Illinois' Oscar De Priest in 1935.
   Gantt, an architect and former mayor of Charlotte, saw his lead
slip away against Helms' charges that the Democrat favored hiring
quotas.
   ``We've seen the triumph of racism over reason in North
Carolina,'' said Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank. ``It's sort
of Willie Horton all over again.''
   Williams said President Bush's veto of a job discrimination bill
helped doom Republicans in the governors' races in Texas and
Florida.
   New Orleans elected a black Democrat, state Sen. William
Jefferson, to succeed the retiring Rep. Lindy Boggs.
   All three Republican congresswomen who ran for the Senate were
defeated - Lynn Martin in Illinois, Claudine Schneider in Rhode
Island and Pat Saiki in Hawaii - and their old House seats went to
Democratic men.
   But Richards' come-from-behind victory against GOP good-ole-boy
Clayton Williams prompted cheers in women's political circles.
   ``We broke the glass ceiling'' that blocked political
advancement, said Jane Danowitz, executive director of the Women's
Campaign Fund.
   She credited the Richards victory to women voters, who favored
Richards 61-39, according to CBS exit polls.
   Two black women, California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and
Detroit Councilwoman Barbara-Rose Collins, won the seats vacated by
retiring black congressmen Augustus Hawkins and George Crockett.
Despite personal tax troubles, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton
captured the non-voting delegate seat from the District of
Columbia.
   The black caucus will have 25 voting members in the 102nd
Congress, up from 23 this year.
   Sharon Pratt Dixon also won election as mayor of Washington,
D.C., the first black woman to take the helm of a major city.
   There will be 28 women in the House, one fewer than this year.
The Senate remains all white with two women, following the
re-election of Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   Democrat Rosa De Lauro, a liberal activist from New Haven,
Conn., won an open seat. She is a former executive director of
EMILY's List, which provides seed money for Democratic women
candidates.
   Wendy Sherman, her successor at EMILY's List, said there has
been ``a sea-change'' in the caliber of women running for high
office.
   ``These were no tokens. They are all competent, savvy, serious
candidates,'' she said.
   Despite being outspent more than 10-1, Republican challenger
Christine Todd Whitman gave a scare to Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley
before losing narrowly.
   Women challengers also lost to incumbent male senators in
Hawaii, Illinois, Rhode Island, Delaware and Wyoming, and Democrat
Josie Heath was defeated by Rep. Hank Brown for an open Senate seat
in Colorado.
   Finney, 65, Kansas treasurer for the past 16 years and an
abortion opponent, toppled pro-choice Republican Gov. Mike Hayden,
whose campaign foundered over taxes.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell, a Republican, easily
turned back a challenge from Democratic state Sen. Theo Mitchell,
who is black.
   Besides Nebraska's Orr, the nation's two other incumbent women
governors, Madeleine Kunin in Vermont and Rose Mofford in Arizona,
chose not to seek new terms.

   Colorado voters expressed a disaffection for
politicians by overwhelming approving a referendum to limit their
terms, but they re-elected Gov. Roy Romer and sent Rep. Hank Brown
to the U.S. Senate.
   And although a tax-limitation amendment was rejected Tuesday, it
gathered significant support and was seen as a signal that tax
reform can no longer be ignored.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Democrat Romer had
623,835 votes, or 63 percent, to 362,157 votes, or 37 percent, for
GOP candidate John Andrews.
   Brown defeated Democrat Josie Heath in the race to succeed the
retiring Bill Armstrong in the U.S. Senate, 567,062 to 424,482, or
57 percent to 43 percent.
   Veterinarian Wayne Allard edged Dick Bond to claim Brown's old
seat in the 4th Congressional District. All five incumbent U.S.
House members - including Patricia Schroeder - prevailed.
   Brown, a former state legislator who went on to win five
consecutive terms in Colorado's 4th District, said voters showed
that the nation's strength ``comes from working men and women up,
and not from Washington down.''
   Heath, in conceding, said: ``I got into this race because I
believed I could make a difference. First there were a dozen of
you, then 100, and then a thousand and now hundreds of thousands
(of voters) who have said it is time for a new agenda.''
   Romer, 62, said he felt honored - and humbled - by his
re-election.
   ``You don't go through this process without understanding who
you are, your possibilities, and your limitations,'' he said
Tuesday night.
   Voters in a mood for change approved four of Colorado's five
ballot issues, including the term-limitation measure and a proposal
to establish casino gambling in three small mountain towns.
   The term-limiting amendment would make Colorado the first state
to limit congressional terms. However, questions linger about
whether it would withstand a constitutional challenge.
   The measure would limit U.S. senators and representatives to 12
years of consecutive service and would cap terms for state
officeholders and lawmakers to eight years at a time.
   The tax-limitation amendment was the only one to fail.

<HEAD>Former Spy Chief Says He Plans To Return to Germany After

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legendary former chief of East
Germany's Stasi secret police who is wanted in Germany says he
plans to return after all-German elections in December, a magazine
reported today.
   The weekly news magazine Stern quoted Markus Wolf as saying, ``I
have no intention of going into exile'' and that he would at some
point return to Germany ``when things quiet down after the Dec. 2
elections.''
   Wolf, under investigation in connection with wrongdoings by
Stasi, did not specifically say he would turn himself in. But the
former spymaster said he expected to be dealt with under existing
German law.
   Stern did not say where it tracked down Wolf, who disappeared
after German unification on Oct. 3.
   In the interview that will appear in Stern's Thursday editions,
Wolf also was quoted as saying he advised Erich Honecker last year
that the Communist leader's anti-reform policy had no support.
   ``The DDR (East Germany) was on the way to becoming a second
Albania,'' Stern quoted Wolf as saying.
   After his talk with Honecker, Wolf said ``I gave up the last
hopes that he would change,'' the magazine reported.
   It is virtually impossible to determine the accuracy of Wolf's
statement that he was against the policies of Honecker, who was
toppled Oct. 18, 1989 by reformist Communists who permitted free
elections.
   Since the collapse of the Communist regime in East Germany many
of the country's former leaders and top officials - including
Honecker - have given interviews trying to put their personal roles
into the best light possible.
   In another report, the newspaper Bild Zeitung said it has
learned from security sources that Wolf is at a Hungarian spa for
treatment of a slipped disc.
   Wolf, who served as the head of East German espionage from 1952
to 1986, became legendary because of his agents' success in
infiltrating West German intelligence and obtaining important NATO
secrets.
   The Stasi, the name for the old East German Ministry for State
Security, included domestic and foreign intelligence agents.

<HEAD>GOP's Edgar Elected Governor, Democrat Simon Returned to Senate in
Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising GOP star Jim Edgar squeaked to victory in
the governor's race while veteran Democrat Paul Simon was easily
re-elected to the U.S. Senate. Both men credited outspokeness for
their victories.
   Edgar, who campaigned in favor of making a temporary 20 percent
increase in the state income tax permanent, gained 51 percent of
the vote in Tuesday's election to edge Democrat Neil Hartigan, the
two-term state attorney general.
   ``The voters have sent a message throughout Illinois and across
the country that politicians can be candid with voters about taxes
and still win,'' he told cheering supporters early today.
   Hartigan opposed extending the two-year tax, but Edgar said it
was necessary to provide needed revenues for schools.
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Edgar, the
44-year-old Illinois secretary of state, had 1,633,330 votes, or 51
percent, to Hartigan's 1,535,514, or 48 percent. Solidarity Party
candidate Jessie Fields had 35,501 votes, or 1 percent.
   Simon, seeking election to a second six-year term, had 2,075,145
votes, or 65 percent, to Rep. Lynn Martin's 1,119,949, or 35
percent.
   Simon said his victory was an endorsement of his call for
government to take a greater role in tackling the nation's top
issues.
   ``We want a nation that sees its security in education, health
care and a clean environment ... as much as in weapons systems,''
he said. ``We want a nation that is firm on the international scene
but that is also sensitive to human rights and the suffering of
people of other nations.''
   In other major races, Republican Lt. Gov. George Ryan was
elected to the secretary of state post being vacated by Edgar, but
Democrat John Cox defeated Republican John Hallock to capture the
Congressional seat Martin is vacating. State Rep. Hallock had been
favored until he was battered by publicity about a child-support
dispute and a ticket for driving 107 mph.
   Democratic victories in state legislative races also gave the
party a veto-proof 73-45 majority in the state House of
Representatives with reapportionment to be considered next year.
   Two congressional Democrats, veteran Frank Annunzio of Chicago
and freshman George Sangmeister of Mokena, also survived stiff
challenges as their party widened its majority in the state's
congressional delegation to 15-7.

   Sen. Bill Bradley, who began his bid for a
third term with polls showing him 47 points ahead of GOP unknown
Christine Todd Whitman, ended the contest by eking out a two-point
win.
   ``What can I say? It's been a few years since I was in a double
overtime,'' the former New York Knicks basketball star said early
today when he finally was able to give a subdued victory speech.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bradley had 964,309
votes, or 50 percent, to 909,694 votes, or 48 percent, for Mrs.
Whitman.
   Bradley has been widely named as a Democratic presidential
prospect. But he has insisted he will concentrate on serving New
Jersey for the next six years, and that promise may be easier to
keep following the razor-thin win.
   Voters turned to his opponent to show their disapproval of new
federal and state taxes, along with general concerns over the
lagging economy, he said.
   ``I think it was close because people were frustrated and
angry,'' Bradley said. ``For all of those of you who are
dissatisfied with government ... even for those who voted against
me as a sign of protest, I hear your voices too,'' he said.
   ``I know you don't distinguish between federal, state or local
taxes ... I know that all of you want a chance to be free of the
constant financial pressure. ... And I finally know that you don't
think politicians have much to offer.''
   Some observers suggested the squeaker catapulted Mrs. Whitman, a
former president of the state Board of Public Utilities, into the
front-runner's spot in the 1993 race against Democratic Gov. Jim
Florio.
   Mrs. Whitman's response to the speculation: ``Who knows?''
   An unpopular $2.8 billion tax package that Florio unveiled after
his election gave Mrs. Whitman an opportunity to attack Bradley for
refusing to comment on his fellow Democrat's policies.
   Mrs. Whitman hit Bradley over his refusal to comment on the
widely hated tax plan, saying it was a sign that he was out of
touch with New Jersey taxpayers.
   ``That's the thing he missed by not being in the state enough
these past years,'' she said.
   This morning, Bradley acknowledged the Florio tax plan was
``clearly an element of the mix,'' but he defended his refusal to
debate the plan with Mrs. Whitman, who has repeatedly denounced it.
   ``I didn't comment because it is essentially not my
responsibility,'' he said.
   Polls showed that a majority of New Jersey voters believed
Bradley should have addressed Florio's tax plan.
   ``He and his friends can forget about any national aspirations
they ever had,'' said Joseph Sullivan, Mrs. Whitman's finance
director.
   However, Anita Dunn of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee said a weak showing by all incumbents was expected, in
light of the messy budget process in Washington.
   ``Especially in New Jersey, where the state budget is an
especially volatile issue,'' she said. ``It's not a key indicator
of anything beyond what's going on in the internal politics of your
own state.''
   In House races, Democrats kept control of eight of 14 seats in
New Jersey's delegation, the same share they had before Florio
vacated his seat upon election as governor.

<HEAD>Oregon School Choice Measure Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregonians strongly rejected a pioneering
measure that would have given tax breaks to parents who send their
children to private schools or educate them at home.
   Unofficial results showed Measure 11 rejected by a margin of 67
percent to 33 percent Tuesday.
   The national education community watched the measure closely,
and Vice President Dan Quayle came to Oregon to campaign for it.
   Measure 11 would have allowed tax credits of up to $2,500 for
sending children to private schools, including religious ones, or
for schooling them at home. The proposal also would have let
parents send children across district lines to any public school in
the state.
   Foes said the plan would mainly have helped the wealthy and
amount to state aid to religion.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Karen Famous, president of the Oregon
Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union. ``I
think it shows Oregon voters do not want public tax dollars
diverted to private education.''
   Ed Marihart, a spokesman for the campaign to pass the proposal,
said confusion probably helped defeat it.
   ``It was a relatively new concept that people misunderstood,''
he said. ``Some people thought it would increase the costs and take
away control from public education.''
   He said backers of the measure might continue their campaign in
the 1991 legislature or launch another initiative drive for the
1992 election.

<TEXT>
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former
Republican U.S. senator whose maverick ways made him a marked man
in the GOP, capped a political comeback by winning the governor's
office as an independent.
   Connecticut voters also made history Tuesday by sending a black
Republican, Gary Franks, to Congress in the 5th District.
   Weicker, 59, a Paris-born millionaire from Greenwich whose
family helped found the Squibb pharmaceutical corporation, is the
first third-party candidate to win Connecticut's governorship since
1856.
   ``We don't have any money in the pot to do what we'd like to
do,'' Weicker said in an appeal for unity in the face of a state
budget deficit that could reach $1.5 billion next year.
   ``So we need your brains and we need your hearts,'' he told
supporters in Simsbury. ``This state badly needs you as it never
needed you before - Republicans, Democrats, independents,
regardless of where you come from.''
   Weicker narrowly edged Republican John G. Rowland, 40 percent to
38 percent. Democrat Bruce A. Morrison came in a distant third with
21 percent. Unofficial returns gave Weicker 455,430 votes, Rowland
423,101 and Morrison 232,077
   Weicker was first elected to the U.S. Senate in a three-way race
in 1970, when he ran as a Republican. After losing his U.S. 50 percent

<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus won a landslide
victory for an unprecedented fourth term, leading his party to
major gains statewide just months after being targeted for defeat
by outraged anti-abortion forces.
   Andrus, 59, who interrupted his tenure as Idaho's chief
executive to serve as Jimmy Carter's interior secretary, claimed
two of every three votes against underdog Republican Roger
Fairchild, 37, a populist businessman who raised $50,000 to contest
the governor's $1 million war chest.
   Ticket-splitting voters did chose five-term GOP Congressman
Larry Craig over Democrat Ron Twilegar to succeed retiring
Republican U.S. Sen James McClure. The party has held that seat for
40 years.
   But Democrat Larry LaRocco replaced Craig as the 1st District
congressman, putting that seat in the Democratic column for the
first time in 24 years and giving Idaho a solid Democratic
delegation in the House for the first time in over a quarter
century.
   Democrats also won the attorney general's office for the first
time 16 years and made major gains in the Legislature.
   ``The Democratic party is here to stay,'' Andrus declared. ``No
longer can they say to us this is a Republican state.''
   Fairchild emphasized his anti-abortion stand in the face of the
governor's March 30 veto of what would have been the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law. But it never energized his campaign
in the face of pro-choice activism.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Paul Wellstone rode a repainted,
back-firing converted school bus nicknamed the ``Magellan II'' to
defeat the big-bucks campaign of 12-year Republican Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz.
   The bus, named after the campaign train Harry Truman took on a
whistle-stop train tour in 1948, became a symbol of the political
science professor's low-budget, volunteer-driven campaign against
Boschwitz's multimillion-dollar war chest.
   Wellstone, 46, bunked with supporters while on the road and once
borrowed campaign money from his wife. ``I've only stayed in a
hotel once,'' said Wellstone, whose campaign raised $800,000 to
Boschwitz's $6.2 million.
   Once called a ``leftist hustler'' and an ``Abbie Hoffman-like
character'' by Boschwitz's campaign secretary, the unabashed
liberal said he wanted to go to Washington ``to shake things up.''
   ``I'm not going to be one of the inner club,'' he said.
   Wellstone took a leave of absence at the elite Carleton College
to run for against Boschwitz, a self-made millionaire. He said
he'll return to teaching when his political career is over.
   Wellstone was chairman of the Jesse Jackson campaign in
Minnesota in 1988, and later was state co-chairman of the Michael
Dukakis campaign. An unsuccessful candidate for state auditor in
1982, he was elected to the Democratic National Committee in 1984
and re-elected in 1988. He was a spokesman for farmers who opposed
the Reagan administration policies, and has written two books on
community organizing.
   Wellstone refused to accept campaign contributions from
political action committees unless they have some ``affiliate or
some membership connection'' with Minnesota, saying he doesn't want
to be beholden to wealth special interests.
   Wellstone said his low budget forced his campaign to come up
with creative TV commercials to catch voters' attention.
   He gained national attention for his infrequently broadcast,
two-minute ``Looking for Rudy'' ad that showed him in a madcap
effort to engage Boschwitz in a debate. The ad was a takeoff of the
1989 documentary ``Roger and Me,'' in which a filmmaker tries to
track down General Motors Chairman Roger Smith.
   Throughout the campaign, Wellstone called for a shift of the S&amp;L
bailout costs to the rich, tougher environmental standards,
guaranteed health care and affordable day care.
   He supports abortion rights and opposes nuclear power and says
Minnesota's law requiring a seven-day waiting period for handgun
purchase should be a model for the nation.
   Wellstone was raised in the Washington, D.C., area and earned a
doctorate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He
moved to Northfield in 1969, where he still lives with his wife,
Sheila. The couple has three children.

   A marcher fired shots on Red Square not far from
Soviet leaders during today's Revolution Day parae, and thousands
of angry citizens held the first protests ever sanctioned in Moscow
on the major Soviet holiday.
   During the traditional parade, a man fired two shots from a
sawed-off shotgun about 80 yards from Lenin Mausoleum, where
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders were watching, a
Tass correspondent said.
   No one appeared to have been hit and police quickly grabbed the
unidentified man, said correspondent Sergei Vozianov, who witnessed
the incident. Voizanov said it was not clear if he was aiming at
anyone.
   The incident occurred on what was already the most unruly
Revolution Day ever, with alternative demonstrations bemoaning the
legacy of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution given official sanction in
Moscow.
   In the independence-minded Baltic republics, authorities told
residents to boycott the holiday by going to work.
   Even official media questioned the wisdom of holding a
celebration amid mounting political, economic and ethnic turmoil.
   Moscow's streets became forums for celebration by Communist
Party supporters and denunciation by radicals who contend the 1917
revolution served only to throw Russian civilization into decline.
   Revolution Day has been the biggest holiday on the Soviet
calendar, focusing until Gorbachev came to power on the Red Square
parade during which the military always showed off its latest
hardware.
   Gorbachev took the traditional Soviet leader's position atop the
Lenin Mausoleum in flag-draped Red Square today and opened the
official celebration with a sober assessment of the state of the
nation.
   ``It's not the fault of previous generations that the goals they
dreamed of were not fulfilled,'' he said, referring to what he
called ``distortions of socialist ideas.''
   Speaking behind a row of microphones and wearing a gray wool
coat, Gorbachev also acknowledged that shortages of goods, a
breakdown of law and order and ethnic strife had worsened in recent
years.
   A few blocks away, at least 2,000 people gathered near Communist
Party headquarters for a counter-demonstration. Two sound trucks
played funereal music as people unfurled banners from different
regions and political groups.
   ``Genocide is the gift of the Leninist Leaders to the People,''
read one. ``Countrymen, how long will we endure hypocrisy, lies,
demagoguery, violence and theft from the Mafia-Communist Party?''
read another.
   Similar rallies were held in Leningrad, Kiev and other cities.
   Gorbachev spoke for 15 minutes, flanked by critical and
supportive leaders, including Russian republic President Boris N.
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. An army band played the
national anthem.
   Red flags hung from street lamps and fluttered on buses across a
capital covered by a thin layer of the season's first snow.
   After rows of armored personnel carriers, tanks and rocket
launchers passed, Gorbachev, anti-establishment Mayor Gavriil Popov
and other leaders filed down the front steps of the mausoleum to
lead a people's parade.
   The official news agency Tass said it was the first time Soviet
leaders had walked with the people on Revolution Day.
   Gorbachev was followed by thousands of people carrying official
banners touting his reform program. Gorbachev and the others broke
off from the parade and laid red carnations at the base of the
mausoleum before going back on top to watch the parade.
   Banners the marchers carried reflected criticism of Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev, Take Your Eyes Off Foreign Affairs and Pay
Attention To The Country,'' read one banner, carried by a branch of
Moscow's city Communist Party organization.
   ``CPSU, Get Out Of Your Coma,'' read another, referring to the
party.
   In the Baltic republics, authorities declared today a working
day, although pro-Moscow groups planned traditional parades. In the
Caucasian republic of Georgia, where non-Communists prevailed in
recent elections, the military parade was moved from the center of
the capital of Tbilisi to an army base.
   In Kiev, radical students and nationalists occupied central
Pobeda Square, vowing to block the official celebration and
military parade. On Tuesday night, 5,000 people gathered for an
anti-Communist rally in another square, according to the
independent news agency Interfax.
   In the Siberian city of Omsk, anti-Communist protesters from the
Democratic Union today held banners near an official demonstration
that read, ``History Will Not Forgive the Crimes of the Communist
Party,'' a local journalist reported.
   Morning newspapers were filled with reports, some glowing and
some critical, of anniversary plans.
   Tass noted the ``complex situation'' the nation faces: ``The
economy is in throes, discord is tearing ethnic minorities asunder
and various social forces are in confrontation.
   ``It is no wonder that some politicians have called into
question the advisability of holding celebrations at all,'' Tass
said.
   Ethnic bloodshed forced cancellation of parades in Kishinev, the
capital of Moldavia, and in Nagorno-Karabakh, the mountainous
region coveted by both the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   In Moscow on Tuesday night, knots of people holding candles
gathered after nightfall at a new monument to victims of Communist
repression, said Galina Starovoytova, a Russian member of
Parliament.
   The monument, erected outside KGB headquarters in Dzherzhinsky
Square, was unveiled last week and been heaped with flowers ever
since.
   Ms. Starovoytova appealed to other legislators taking part in
the celebrations to, ``after seeing the military power, turn your
faces to look at the misery and poverty our country is facing.''
   ``Society is falling apart,'' said Gleb Yakunin, a Russian
Orthodox priest leading one of the counterdemonstrations. ``It is a
day of mourning, the day of the most tragic event in our history.''

   Arizona voters rejected two proposals to honor
Martin Luther King Jr. with a state holiday, and waited for the
other shoe to drop: a move by the National Football League to yank
the 1993 Super Bowl out of the state.
   Proposition 301, which would have created a paid King holiday
but eliminated a paid Columbus Day, was rejected Tuesday by a
3-to-1 margin. Proposition 302, which would have given state
workers both days off, was defeated by fewer than 15,000 votes out
of about 1 million cast.
   The NFL awarded the 1993 Super Bowl to suburban Tempe earlier
this year, but Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman promised to
lead a drive to reverse the decision if the state failed to enact a
King holiday.
   It was with that threat in mind that the Legislature ended
nearly two decades of divisive debate over the issue last year by
passing a bill creating Martin Luther King-Civil Rights Day in
Arizona.
   But opponents, led by impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, circulated
petitions to force a referendum on the issue.
   Arnie Zaler, one of the leaders of the King Day campaign, said
there probably will be a renewed effort next year to create the
holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader.
   ``This is going to be a test of our leadership and our belief in
Dr. King's dream,'' Zaler said.

<HEAD>Ticket-Splitting Iowa Voters Re-Elect Harkin, Branstad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tom Harkin said his support for abortion
rights helped him become the first Iowa Democrat to win a second
U.S. Senate term.
   Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, meanwhile, said voters who swept
him to a third four-year term Tuesday gave him a clear mandate for
his policies. He also retains veto power over congressional
redistricting approved by the Democratic-controlled state House and
Senate.
   Harkin, 50, had been a target for the GOP since he ousted
Republican Sen. Roger Jepsen in 1984 and became a persistent, vocal
administration critic.
   He faced GOP U.S. Rep Tom Tauke in a two-year fight that was the
most expensive political race in Iowa's history at $11 million in
combined spending.
   Harkin drew a sharp distinction with Tauke's anti-abortion
stance, and groups on both sides of the issue targeted the race.
   ``People knew where we stood on the issue,'' Harkin said. ``I
didn't say it was a key issue, but it was an important issue.''
   Tauke had said he would ban abortion even for rape and incest
victims. President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle campaigned
repeatedly for him.
   With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Harkin
collected 518,109 votes, or 54 percent, to 441,456, or 46 percent,
for Tauke.
   With 98 percent of the votes counted in the governor's race,
Branstad had 61 percent, or 575,437 votes, to Avenson's 39 percent,
or 370,430 votes.
   ``It's clearly a mandate for the policies that I've
established,'' Branstad said. ``I've never won by that kind of a
margin in the governor's race.''

<TEXT>
   Tolerance triumphed as city voters upheld the
extension of spousal benefits to unmarried partners of municipal
employees, supporters of the benefits said.
   ``I think this is a city that doesn't want to exclude anybody,''
said Pam Weeks, co-manager of the No on Bigotry-No on 35 campaign.
   With 99 percent of he precincts reporting, the vote on
Initiative 35, a move to repeal the benefits, was 81,638 no and
58,510 yes.
   Seattle is the largest city in the nation to extend medical and
dental coverage to live-in companions of municipal employees, along
with compassionate leave for employees whose unmarried partners are
sick or die.
   Julia Fogassy, who ran the Initiative 35 campaign, said, ``If
people had truly understood the issue, I don't think we would have
lost.''
   An ordinance extending funeral and sick leave in the case of
unmarried partners was adopted by the City Council last year after
a ruling by the municipal Human Rights Department.
   By eliminating registration of non-marital partnerships under
that ordinance, Initiative 35 also would have eliminated a second
ordinance that extended optional health and dental coverage to
unmarried partners of municipal workers last spring, Fogassy said.
   Initiative 35 was the nation's first ballot proposal for
eliminating an established bereavement and sick leave program for
unmarried partners.
   San Franciscans passed a measure Tuesday allowing unmarried
couples to register non-marital relationships but without
conferring formal benefits.

   Gov. Mike Sullivan's accent on optimism
and a brighter future for Wyoming led to a landslide that set a
state victory-margin record.
   ``I stressed a positive campaign in every respect, and that's
what the people of Wyoming want to see,'' he said.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson also coasted to victory Tuesday, winning
a third term in office, and U.S. Rep. Craig Thomas - elected in
1989 to fill the seat vacated by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney -
won his first full term in Congress.
   Throughout the gubernatorial campaign, Republican Mary Mead
attacked Sullivan's leadership and maintained that the state's
economy was ``lousy.''
   But the Democratic incumbent pointed to the state's reviving
econony, including coal, tourism and agriculture.
   Unofficial returns from 458 of the state's 471 precincts gave
Sullivan 100,473 votes, or 65 percent, and Mead 53,262, or 35
percent.
   The late Gov. Ed Herschler had held the victory-margin record,
whipping Republican Warren Morton in 1982 with 63 percent of the
vote.
   Simpson, the Senate minority whip, easily won a third term,
garnering 96,772 votes, or 64 percent, while Democratic challenger
Kathy Helling received 54,330, or 36 percent.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Paul Wellstone, who ran his campaign
on a shoestring and a laugh, defeated Republican Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz in a fitting conclusion to Minnesota's strange political
season.
   The wild gubernatorial race between Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich
and Republican challenger Arne Carlson was still too close to call
today.
   Returns were slow because Carlson's last-minute substitution for
GOP candidate Jon Grunseth required votes to be counted by hand.
Grunseth dropped out of the race a little over a week ago following
allegations that he had gone skinny-dipping with teen-age girls and
cheated on two wives.
   With 83 percent of precincts reporting today, Carlson held a
slim lead over Perpich, the Democrat-Farmer-Labor incumbent who was
trying for an unprecedented fourth term. Carlson had 565,045 votes
in unofficial returns to 564,962 for Perpich.
   ``I feel like Lazarus,'' Carlson told supporters.
   Wellstone, a political science professor who decided to test his
theories outside academe, had 608,377 votes, or 51 percent, to
Boschwitz's 577,377, or 49 percent, with 83 percent of precincts
reporting.
   ``With this victory, politics will never be the same in
Minnesota,'' Wellstone told cheering supporters. ``With every ounce
of energy that I have, I'll do everything I can to represent
Minnesota well in Washington.''
   Boschwitz left his campaign headquarters shortly before midnight
and said he was going to bed. Campaign aides refused to concede the
race. However, his campaign manager, Tom Mason, said there had been
``a clear negative move away from the Republicans and Rudy in
general.''
   Boschwitz was the only incumbent senator to lose in Tuesday's
elections.
   Republican Arlan Stangeland, who had been hounded by questions
about late-night telephone calls to and from a Virginia woman's
home, lost his U.S. House seat to DFL challenger Collin Peterson.
   The governor's race appeared headed for the closest finish since
1962, when DFLer Karl Rolvaag won a 91-vote recount victory over
Republican Gov. Elmer L. Andersen in a race that wasn't decided
until March 1963.
   Carlson, 56, had finished second in the Republican primary. He
had already begun a write-in campaign for the general election when
Grunseth dropped out of the race and a reeling Republican Party
quickly made Carlson its official candidate.
   Perpich, 62, had been considered easy to beat earlier in the
year, when he was dubbed ``Governor Goofy'' for a series of odd
statements. But the Republican disarray allowed him to bounce back.
   Boschwitz blamed Grunseth for his own political problems, saying
he had cast the entire party in a bad light.
   Wellstone, 46, a Carleton College professor who campaigned in a
ramshackle bus, gained recognition with a series of humorous
television ads - one of which showed him ``looking for Rudy'' in a
takeoff of the documentary film ``Roger and Me.'' His shoe-leather
campaign spent about $1 million to $7 million for Boschwitz.

   Democrat Joan Finney's victory in the
governor's race over incumbent Republican Mike Hayden headed a
surprising Democratic surge that included a possible triumph in the
party's battle for control of the state House.
   Finney became the first woman governor of Kansas, garnering 49
percent of the vote to Hayden's 42 percent. With virtually all of
the vote counted early today, Mrs. Finney had 380,649 votes to
Hayden's 331,744.
   Independent candidate Christina Campbell-Cline trailed with
68,856 votes, or 9 percent - more votes than any independent
candidate for governor since John R. ``Doc'' Brinkley in 1932.
   Unofficial returns showed Democrats with a one-seat edge over
Republicans in the state House of Representatives.
   But two of the Democrats' victories came by margins of only four
and six votes - meaning recounts could reverse those outcomes and
keep Republicans in charge.
   At the congressional level, Republicans their ground.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, as expected, easily defeated Democratic
challenger Dick Williams, ringing up 73 percent of the vote.
   The GOP also kept its 3-2 advantage in the state's U.S. House
delegation as banker Dick Nichols won the 5th District seat vacated
by Republican Bob Whittaker. Nichols got 59 percent of the vote
over Democrat George Wingert.
   Four incumbent congressmen - including Democrats Jim Slattery
and Dan Glickman, and Republicans Pat Roberts and Jan Meyers - all
won re-election with majorities ranging from 60 percent to 71
percent.
   Voters rejected for the third time a proposed constitutional
amendment that would have restored full policy control over
education to the Legislature.

<TEXT>
   Bruce G. Sundlun, the voters'
overwhelming choice over Republican Edward D. DiPrete in the Rhode
Island governor's race, is a hard-driving businessman with the
touch of a New Deal Democrat.
   A quintessential state political insider, the 70-year-old
millionaire triumphed in his third challenge of DiPrete for
possession of the highest office in the nation's smallest state.
   Along the way, the candidate, who smiles easily in private but
had a stiff and sometimes brusque public persona, softened and
seemed to enjoy campaigning.
   ``I think it's because I have learned, not 100 percent, but I
have learned to be a public person,'' Sundlun said.
   After his victory, he said the voters also caught on.
   ``I think...the voters of Rhode Island said `he's been out there
twice and he's been right on all the issues,' '' Sundlun said.
   The former Outlet Co. chief executive twice fought DiPrete when
the Republican was at the height of his popularity. This year he
took umbrage when two primary challengers, sensing a weakened
DiPrete, stepped in.
   ``I put the food on the plate and they want to eat it, and at
that point my competitive hackles start to rise a bit,'' Sundlun
said before the primary.
   Sundlun went public with a 61-page homily called ``Hope,'' in
which he described himself as a formerly shy Jewish kid who grew up
on Providence's East Side during te Depression and admired
President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   ``I learned early on that you have to help people, and I learned
early on that the government is a good vehicle for helping people
in times of crisis,'' he wrote.
   Sundlun promises to do it with a businessman's touch, offering
incentives to firms that provide services like day care and
promising time off for juvenile prisoners who complete classes.
   The Harvard-educated lawyer became a federal prosecutor in 1949
but returned to private practice five years later. He participated
in Tennesee Sen. Estes Kefauver's 1956 campaign and helped John F.
Kennedy's presidential run in 1960.
   Sundlun says he's made the transition from uptight executive to
at-ease public official.
   ``I know exactly when and where I crossed it,'' he said. It was
just before a television interview when his campaign manager told
him to ``be a governor, not a candidate, and I understood exactly
what he meant.''

   Democrat Ben Nelson held a 4,000-vote lead
over Republican Gov. Kay Orr today in his quest to deny a second
term to the state's first woman governor.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Nelson had 281,982 votes
to Orr's 277,914. An automatic recount was likely.
   ``Well, I know I can live through a recount if I have to,''
Nelson said today. ``Heck, I can live through several of them.''
   U.S. Sen. Jim Exon retained his seat after a nasty race against
Republican Hal Daub. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Exon
had 337,624 votes, or 59 percent, to Daub's 233,861 votes, or 41
percent.
   While campaigning for Daub, Sen. John Tower of Texas said he
heard rumors that Exon was ``one of the two or three biggest
boozers'' in the Senate.
   Exon denied the rumors, then alluded to rumors of domestic
violence in Daub's family.
   Exon claimed his win sent a message ``that there's no chance for
winning in Nebraska with character assassination techniques'' like
the ones Daub used against him.
   In the 3rd District, Republican state Sen. Bill Barrett kept the
seat in the party by defeating Democrat Sandra Scofield to succeed
retiring U.S. Rep. Virginia Smith.
   Republican Rep. Doug Bereuter coasted to an easy seventh-term
victory in his 1st District race. Democratic Rep. Peter Hoagland
defeated Republican Ally Milder in the 2nd District.
   Also Tuesday, voters rejected a proposed constitutional
amendment to limit state and local spending increases to 2 percent
annually and defeated a move to repeal a school financing law that
boosted sales and income tax rates.

   Tax rebels and the environmental movement were snubbed by the
nation's voters, but so were ballot measures calling for higher
taxes. Gun control forces won a victory in Florida, and supporters
of limiting politicians' time in office triumphed in California,
Colorado and Kansas City, Mo.
   In Tuesday's most closely watched ballot initiative,
Californians rejected Proposition 128, a far-reaching lineup of
environmental regulations dubbed ``Big Green'' by supporters who
included a galaxy of Hollywood stars. Opponents, led by industrial
companies, marshaled $10 million in their campaign to defeat it.
   Measures backed by environmentalists to regulate land use and
pollution also lost in Washington, Oregon and Missouri. A $1.97
billion bond issue to py for environmental projects failed in New
York.
   Citizen initiatives calling for drastic tax cuts or limits on
government spending lost in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Colorado and
Utah. But in Oregon, an initiative to limit property taxes to 1.5
percent of assessed value passed narrowly.
   Florida voters amended the state constitution to require a
three-day wait on handgun purchases.
   In other voting, a pair of anti-abortion proposals lost in
Oregon, while Nevadans made it harder to change that state's
liberal abortion law.
   A proposal to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a holiday
in Arizona lost by fewer than 15,000 votes out of 1 million cast,
leaving the state as one of three without a formal holiday honoring
the slain civil rights leader.
   Voters in Oregon defeated a plan to give tax credits to parents
who send their children to parochial or other private schools, and
Arizonans rejected a proposal to increase spending on education by
about $6 billion over 10 years.
   The Massachusetts tax initiative would have repealed two income
tax increases and rescinded fee increases since 1988, costing the
state's government $2.6 billion in its next fiscal year. It lost by
a 3-to-2 margin.
   The measure would have been the biggest voter-initiated state
tax rollback in history. But with the state's economic woes, voters
apparently were worried about the impact, said Paul Watanabe, a
political scientist at the University of Massachusetts.
   ``They wanted change but (the measure) went too far,'' he said.
   Nebraskans voted 2-to-1 against the ``Two Percent Solution,''
which would have capped growth in local and state government
spending at 2 percent a year.
   Utah voters turned down a measure that would have eliminated the
sales tax on most food, and Coloradans narrowly defeated a
requirement for voter approval for tax increases.
   Voters weren't sending a welcoming message to higher taxes,
however.
   Montanans voted against a proposal to make the state cigarette
tax the highest in the nation in an attempt to reduce smoking.
Californians rejected two proposals to increase liquor taxes, while
voters in Nevada defeated a corporate profits tax and upheld a
constitutional ban on personal income taxes.
   Residents of Gwinnett County, Ga., defeated a 1 percent sales
tax to finance a suburban extension of Atlanta's rapid transit
system. A 1 percent utility tax increase to finance a stadium for
baseball's San Francisco Giants lost narrowly in Santa Clara
County, Calif.
   The nearly 2-to-1 defeat of California's ``Big Green'' was a big
setback for environmentalists. The measure would have imposed a
wide range of controls on emissions, pesticides, offshore
oil-drilling and logging.
   Business groups argued it would cost several billion dollars
annually in higher gas, electricity and food prices. Supporters
said it would save several billion dollars a year in energy and
health costs.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a primary sponsor of
the measure, said voters had become conservative about spending
money on new programs.
   ``I think the invasion of Kuwait, the beginning of the
recession, the national budget crisis, the state budget crisis -
all those things have scared people,'' he said.
   Voters in Washington rejected a sweeping measure to control
development in environmentally sensitive areas and mandate land-use
planning throughout the state. In Oregon, voters defeated strict
recycling rules and a proposal to shut down the state's only
nuclear power plant.
   Missourians said no to a ``Natural Streams'' initiative to
regulate development along scenic waterways in the Ozark Mountains.
In South Dakota, a measure to limit mining in the Black Hills lost,
but a proposal to regulate large-scale garbage dumps won.
   Colorado voters easily passed a far-reaching measure to limit
the number of terms served by politicians. The limits would even
apply to U.S. senators and congressmen, one aspect that may run
afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
   In California, a measure limiting politicians to two terms and
ending state contributions to officeholders' pensions passed 52
percent-48 percent.
   Voters in Kansas City, Mo., limited the mayor and city council
members to two terms. And in Arizona, voters rejected a pay raise
for legislators.
   Elsewhere:
   -Alaskans voted to again make the private use of marijuana a
crime.
   -Washington, D.C., voters turned back an attempt to restore the
right of homeless people to city-financed overnight shelter.
   -Arizonans defeated a 20 percent cut in auto insurance rates.
   -Maine voters abolished the state's tough blue laws that force
most big retailers to close on Sundays.
   -Oregonians made it illegal not to use seat belts in cars. They
also voted to experiment with replacing welfare benefits with
low-pay jobs, but the program would require approval from Congress.
   -Voters in the Staten Island borough of New York City approved a
referendum to start a process that could lead to secession from the
city. Voters in predominantly black Boston neighborhoods also
considered a secession study, but vote totals had not been
released.
   -Seattle voters retained spousal benefits for unmarried
companions of municipal employees. San Franciscans passed a less
sweeping measure allowing unmarried couples to register their
relationships with city officials but without conferring formal
benefits.
   -Residents of Sacramento, Calif., and surrounding Sacramento
County rejected a merger that would have created the nation's
seventh-largest city.

   Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, whose
campaign by buoyed by a stong economy, promised to make Wisconsin
recession-proof after his election to a second term.
   Thompson crushed his Democratic opponent, state Assembly Speaker
Tom Loftus, in Tuesday's election.
   Democratic Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, a 32-year veteran of
Congress, lost a close race to Republican Scott Klug, a political
newcomer and former TV news reporter.
   With 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Thompson had
797,234 votes, or 58 percent, to Loftus' 574,313, or 42 percent.
   With all ballots counted, Klug had 96,603 votes, or 53 percent,
to Kastenmeier's 85,011, or 47 percent.
   Wisconsin has one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates at
3.8 percent, and Thompson, 48, said strong economic conditions will
continue.
   ``We will make jobs available for all of our people, will make
opportunity what it should be, and make education No. 1 because I
strongly believe Wisconsin can become the No. 1 state in the
nation,'' he said.
   Kastenmeier, 66, had previously found strong support for his
pro-civil rights, anti-nuclear and anti-war positions in the
congressional district that includes traditionally liberal Madison.
He said anti-incumbent sentiment did him in this time.
   The 37-year-old Klug agreed. He had called for limiting
congressional service to 12 years and had criticized congressional
pay raises during his campaign.
   ``It made people angry. They wanted a change,'' he said.

   Missouri voters, unreceptive to more
government, rejected a new agency to oversee state waterways and
ousted 14 state legislators.
   Republican U.S. Rep. Jack Buechner was trailing by 52 votes
early today in his bid for a third term. The state's eight other
congressmen won re-election.
   The Natural Streams Act, criticized as a bureaucratic land grab,
was rejected by 75 percent of the voters. The act would have
created a state commission for governing 52 scenic waterways.
   Kansas City voters approved limiting City Council members to two
four-year terms, while a non-binding St. Louis County vote opposed
federal dioxin burning in Times Beach.
   Republican State Auditor Margaret Kelly eased to a second
four-year term, beating Democratic novice Connie Hendren in the
only statewide race on Tuesday.
   Buechner trailed Democrat Joan Kelly Horn by 52 votes out of
188,548 cast in St. Louis and St. Charles counties. Buechner noted
that some absentee ballots might not be counted for days.
   Buechner was talking to lawyers about a recount, ``which is
mandatory when the difference is less than 1 percent.''
   ``Missouri seems to have been swept by a wave of
anti-incumbency,'' said Buechner, a suburban St. Louis congressman.

   Voters in California, Colorado and Kansas City, Mo., slapped
limits Tuesday on how long politicians can hold office.
   Californians imposed a lifetime cap on an individual's service,
granting a total of six years - three terms - for Assembly members
and eight years - two terms - for state senators. The eight-year
limit also applies to statewide officers.
   The change will rock the ``careerists'' in the state
legislature, said Lewis Uhler, co-sponsor of the proposition. ``It
demonstrates the depth of feeling on the part of the people and
helps to launch a national crusade,'' he said.
   The measure also eliminated the legislature's pension program
and cut its operating budget about 40 percent.
   Californians defeated another measure, backed by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader and Common Cause, to limit statewide officers
to eight consecutive years and allow legislators only 12
consecutive years in each house.
   The Colorado measure, the biggest vote-getter on the state
ballot, imposed a limit of eight consecutive years for holding a
single state office.
   It applies to the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of
state, treasurer, attorney general and seats in the state
legislature.
   It also would limit members of the U.S. Senate and House to 12
years in office, but such state limits on federal offices may be
vulnerable to a constitutional challenge.
   The measure won support from 71 percent of voters.
   The vote signaled that voters support sweeping reform, said
state Sen. Terry Considine, the driving force behind Amendment 5.
   ``On Amendment 5, it came as no surprise to me there was such an
overwhelming number supporting it,'' he said. ``Colorado has set an
example that will be imitated all across our country. People from
30 states worked with me on this, and I think we can get reforms in
Congress.''
   Kansas City residents limited city council members and the mayor
to two consecutive four-year terms. Council members can run again
after sitting out a term.
   The measure, which passed 36,596 to 31,379, prevents nine of the
current 13 council members from seeking re-election in the spring.
   ``Eight years is enough,'' said Henry E. Lyons, a real estate
developer who was behind the move to get the proposal on the
ballot.
   Apart from Tuesday's contests, efforts are under way to limit
terms of office in Florida, Illinois, New York and Ohio. Several
states are also considering constitutional amendments to limit
terms in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
   In another measure of voter sentiment, Arizona defeated a
proposed pay raise for legislators by a margin of 2 to 1.

   Former two-time Democratic Gov. Bruce
King regained the office Tuesday, giving his party power to
dominate next year's reapportionment.
   King defeated Republican Frank Bond.
   Popular incumbent Republican Pete Domenici won a lopsided U.S.
Senate race over Democratic challenger Tom Benavides, an
Albuquerque state senator.
   With 57 percent of precincts reporting, King had 116,858 votes,
or 55 percent, to 96,194 votes, or 45 percent, for Bond.
   With 57 percent of precincts reporting in the Senate race,
Domenici had 151,147 votes, or 72 percent, to 58,112 votes, or 28
percent, for Benavides.
   The GOP's 2-1 edge in the U.S. House was not threatened, as one
Republican was unopposed and the incumbent Republican and Democrat
in the other two districts were expected to win.
   King, 66, and Bond, 47, vied to succeed Republican Garrey
Carruthers, who was prohibited by law from seeking re-election.
However, a change in the state constitution will allow the winner
to seek re-election in four years.
   King, a Stanley, N.M., rancher, served as governor longer than
anyone in state history. He was governor from 1971 to 1974 and
again from 1979 to 1982.

   Oregon voters approved an experiment that

will require the approval of Congress.
   Measure 7, which passed 57 percent-43 percent Tuesday, calls for
a three-year test in six counties that would eliminate food stamps,
federal aid to families with dependent children and unemployment
benefits. People eligible for public assistance would be assigned
to jobs with public or private employers and be paid at 90 percent

   Voters rejected a proposal to merge
the city and county of Sacramento, which would have created the
nation's seventh-largest city.
   The proposal lost by 58 percent to 42 percent in Sacramento
County and by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent inside the city.
   The county has just over 1 million residents. About 350,000 of
them live in the city of Sacramento. Passage of the proposal would

   Voters in this coastal community
rejected a ballot measure seen as aimed at the city's benign stance
toward homeless people.
   The measure, which lost by a nearly 3-to-2 margin Tuesday, would
have made the city attorney an elected rather than appointed post.
   Supporters of the proposal argued that City Attorney Robert
Myers encouraged criminal and mentally ill homeless people to
settle in Santa Monica by refusing to enforce such minor ordinances
as a ban on sleeping in parks.
   Myers called the initiative ill-conceived.
   ``I think what it (the election result) shows is that voters are
not ready to adopt extremist measures in dealing with a national
tragedy,'' he said.
   ``Homelessness is not caused by the city attorney of Santa
Monica. It is caused by forces operating throughout the nation.''

   A 1 percent utility tax to finance the ballpark lost by less

   A measure in Oregon that would have
established the most restrictive anti-abortion law in the United
States was rejected by a 2-1 margin.
   The law would have banned abortions except in cases of rape or
incest or to prevent a woman's death. A second measure that would
have required doctors to notify a parent at least two days before
performing an abortion on a minor was also defeated, by a smaller
margin.
   In Nevada, voters approved a measure to protect abortion rights.
The measure prohibits any change in the state's abortion rights law
except by direct vote of the people.
   Diane Linn, head of the Oregon chapter of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said, ``We're extremely excited that we were
able to defeat both an easy and a very tough measure.''
   Cindy Rahm, spokeswoman for United Families of Oregon, which
sponsored the measure, said her group knew it faced an uphill
battle from the start.
   ``We recognized from the very first that this is going to be a

   Kentucky voters sent an ambiguous message
by throwing out 11 state lawmakers - seven who voted for a $1.3
billion tax increase and four who did not. U.S. Sen. Mitch
McConnell won another term.
   Kentucky's congressional delegation emerged unscathed. Two
Supreme Court justices also were re-elected, and two new justices
were selected to replace retirees.
   Of 11 state legislators who lost, seven were in the House and
four in the Senate. Eight were Democrats and three were
Republicans.
   All the defeated state senators voted for the $1.3 billion tax
increase passed by the 1990 General Assembly. But four of the seven
defeated House members voted against it.
   Republican McConnell won 53 percent of the vote, to 47 percent
over Democrat Harvey Sloane. With all but 16 of 3,231 precincts
reporting, McConnell received 474,672 votes to 428,781 for Sloane.
   An amendment to the state constitution to exempt religious
institutions from virtually all property taxes was overwhelmingly
approved.
   The turnout approached 50 percent of the state's 1.8 million
voters, larger than most predictions.

   Senate incumbents overcame widespread voter
disenchantment as 31 of 32 lawmakers won re-election. The only
loser was two-term Republican Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota.
   With 88 percent of precincts reporting, Boschwitz lost to
college professor Paul Wellstone, a political neophyte, by a 52-48
margin.
   Wellstone's victory boosted Democrats' majority in the Senate to
56-44, a one-seat gain from the 101st Congress.
   ``I think the main thing was that people are kind of angry at
Washington, don't feel represented and want to see some real
change,'' Wellstone said today on NBC. ``We focused on issues and
people. And it captured the imagination of people in Minnesota.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Democrats'
success Tuesday ``means that the Republican chances of taking
control in 1992 are much diminished and I think we will retain
control in '92,''
   Democratic hopes of picking up another seat in North Carolina
were dashed as Republican Sen. Jesse Helms turned back a tough
challenge from former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt.
   Meanwhile, some Democrats touted as possible contenders for
President Bush's job in 1992 shored up their political standing
with easy wins in Tuesday's election.
   The lone surprise was New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's slim
victory over unheralded GOP challenger Christine Todd Whitman.
Feeling the heat of anti-government anger prompted by Democratic
Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, Bradley managed a
52-48 percent victory.
   The margin was far below predictions of a 35 percent-plus
victory for Bradley.
   Republican dreams of capturing the Senate seat in Hawaii
disappeared as appointed Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka withstood a
stiff test from Rep. Pat Saiki and won his first full term.
   Wellstone, a liberal activist who traversed Minnesota on a green
bus, stopped Boschwitz from returning to the Senate for a third
term.
   ``If present trends continue, that bus is going to take a U.S.
senator from Minnesota to Washington, D.C.,'' Wellstone told his
backers Tuesday evening before he was declared the winner.
   Boschwitz, who hoped to receive a boost when Bush visited the
state to campaign for him, told supporters he did not expect the
race to be so close.
   Bradley, one of 14 Democratic incumbents who retained their
Senate seats, expressed similar disbelief.
   ``What can I say? It's been a few years since I was in a double
overtime,'' said the former Princeton University and New York
Knicks basketball star.
   Republicans contend that Bradley's narrow victory could hurt his
presidential aspirations.
   ``Senator Bradley might be off the charts now,'' said Charles
Black, the communications director for the Republican National
Committee.
   Democrats, however, said the final outcome was merely a
reflection of the electorate's discontent and will have no bearing
on a possible bid for the White House.
   The major Democratic target was Helms, the 69-year-old champion
of the right wing who was pitted against Gantt.
   Helms, who had contended in the closing days that Gantt favored
racial quotas, relished his victory.
   ``There is no joy in Mudville tonight,'' the senator said. ``The
mighty ultra-liberal establishment, the liberal politicians and
editors and commentators and columnists have struck out again.''
   Democrats also hoped for a gain in Oregon, but four-term
Republican Mark Hatfield outdistanced businessman-scientist Harry
Lonsdale.
   Republicans retained control of the three open Senate seats.
Rep. Robert Smith defeated former Sen. John Durkin in New
Hampshire, while Rep. Hank Brown won in Colorado and Rep. Larry
Craig was the victor in Idaho.
   Democratic incumbents Claiborne Pell in Rhode Island, Carl Levin
in Michigan and Paul Simon in Illinois won surprisingly easy
victories over well-financed Republican House members. Sen. J.
James Exon, D-Neb., beat former Republican Rep. Hal Daub.
   Other incumbents of both parties won with ease.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, won unopposed. Sens. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and David
Pryor, D-Ark., also had no contests.
   Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo. won easily. In South Dakota,
Republican Sen. Larry Pressler gained a third term.
   Other senior incumbents returned to office were Sens. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., at 87 the Senate's oldest member; Howell Heflin,
D-Ala.; John Warner, R-Va.; David Boren, D-Okla.; Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.; William Cohen, R-Maine; Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; and Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
   Nunn and Bradley were two of several possible future
presidential candidates who won re-election to the Senate. Others
who won re-election were Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, both with ease.
   Other winners were Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore.; Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; John Kerry,
D-Mass.; and Max Baucus, D-Mont.

   Japanese officials today heatedly denied any link
between Iraq's release of more than 70 Japanese hostages and the
Tokyo government's decision to drop its proposal to send troops
overseas.
   Seventy-four Japanese nationals flew to freedom today with
Japan's former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who secured their
relase during a five-day mission to Iraq.
   The Iraqis had announced that 77 Japanese were free to go, but
Japanese Embassy officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said three of them decided to stay in Baghdad to finish their
businesss.
   The embassy officials denied that the Iraqis had refused to give
exit visas to some of the Japanese.
   ``The Iraqis did not change their mind, the three businessmen
did,'' said one of the officials.
   The departure of the 74 freed hostages leaves 237 Japanese in
Iraq and occupied Kuwait, of whom 119 are held at strategic sites
as ``human shields.''
   In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto told reporters
``it is unthinkable that there was any linkage'' between the
release and other issues.
   ``America, Britain, and the European Community have taken the
position that they will not directly negotiate over the hostages,
and our government has followed the same basic position,'' Sakamoto
said.
   But some analysts feared the timing of the two events would
create the impression that Japan had succumbed to Saddam Hussein's
apparent strategy to divide the international alliance against
Iraq.
   They also worried that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
embarrassing setback in Parliament over the troop bill has further
undermined his weak administration, particularly since he was shown
up the same day by a powerful former prime minister, Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
   The Iraqi News Agency reported that Nakasone had assured Saddam
in a meeting Sunday that the troop deployment proposal was unlikely
to succeed.
   On Tuesday, Iraq announced its hostage-releasing plan. On the
same day, Kaifu and the governing Liberal Democratic Party
abandoned the troop deployment proposal, which faltered against
powerful opposition in Parliament and strong public opinion that it
violated Japan's constitutional ban on using force overseas.
   The bill, which would have sent up to 2,000 troops to the
Persian Gulf in a non-combat role, was also harshly criticized in
recent weeks by other Asian countries fearful of a resurgence of
Japanese militarism.
   Japan has already pledged $4 billion in aid for the
multinational deployment and for refugees of the crisis.
   Japanese government officials could not confirm today whether
Nakasone had made any assurances to Saddam. They said Nakasone's
mission was unofficial.
   But Sakamoto said today that Nakasone pledged before his
departure that he would demand the unconditional release of
Japanese and all other hostages.
   Nonetheless, analysts said the timing of Nakasone's visit was
unfortunate. It underscored the perception that Japan's Persian
Gulf policy, never firm, was disintegrating in the hands of a weak
prime minister upstaged by party elders.
   ``Even if this release was not related to the abandonment of the
bill in the Diet (parliament), I would say criticism of Mr.
Nakasone would be likely to come from Washington'' and other
Western countries, said Masashi Nishihara, a politics expert at the
Defense Academy.
   The bill was criticized by many Japanese as a cave-in to U.S.
pressure to participate in the gulf.
   ``My concern is the lack of power of Mr. Kaifu,'' said
Nishihara. By inviting Nakasone to visit, ``Iraq seemed to think
that Kaifu is just no good and Nakasone would do a better job.''
   Kaifu visited the gulf region early last month but was unable to
obtain any solid results. Japan imports 70 percent of its oil from
the gulf.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today denied reports he gave Iraq an ultimatum to get out of Kuwait
in the next two weeks.
   Reports by Israel army radio and stations in Luxembourg and
Monte Carlo said Baker had asked his Chinese counterpart, Qian
Qichen, to tell Saddam Hussein that U.S. forces would attack if he
didn't comply.
   Baker met with Qian in Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday.
   The Israeli report cited unidentified diplomatic sources in
Cairo. RTL Plus television, a private station in Luxembourg,
carried a similar story without citing a source. Radio Monte Carlo
also reported a Baker ultimatum.
   Asked to comment on the reports, Baker told reporters in Turkey:
``The fact is I did not have such a conversation with the Chinese
foreign minister.''
   Baker stopped in Turkey on his weeklong tour of the Persian Gulf
region to cement support for the anti-Iraq forces and to discuss
military options.
   In its report, RTL Plus said of the reported ultimatum, ``Within
14 days Iraq must pull out of Kuwait. If not, the United States
together with Saudi Arabia want to attack the gulf state.''
   Qian indicated to Baker on Tuesday that Beijing would not stand
in the way of any U.N. vote authorizing a military strike to force
Iraq out of Kuwait, U.S. officials said. China is one of the five
U.N. Security Council members with veto power over resolutions.
   But Qian, who met for two hours with Baker, did not explicitly
approve sending troops into action and expressed hopes a peaceful
settlement could be rached. ``We'll have to wait and see,'' he
told reporters.

<TEXT>
   A proposal to strip Arkansas'
constitution of a relic from its racist past appeared to have won
voter approval - barely.
   Amendment 3, to repeal a 1956 anti-desegregation statute, held a
51-to-49 percent margin in unofficial returns from Tuesday's
voting.
   With 2,580 of 2,696 precincts reporting, the amendment was
leading 262,679, or 51 percent, to 250,946, or 49 percent.
   The 1956 law instructed state officials to ``take appropriate
action and pass laws opposing in every constitutional manner the
unconstitutional desegregation decisions of May 17, 1954 and May
31, 1955 of the United States Supreme Court.''
   It was enacted the year before federal troops thwarted Gov.
Orval Faubus' attempt to keep nine black students from enrolling at
all-white Little Rock Central High.
   State officials have ignored the statute, and last year it was
declared unconstitutional. But a federal district court mentioned
it in orders that assigned the state liability for desegregating
the Pulaski County schools.
   State leaders had said Arkansas surely would face national
ridicule if the proposal failed.
   ``It would be a tremendous embarrassment if we don't vote this
thing out. We need to clean up the constitution for our children,''
said Rep. Ben McGee, the first black legislator from eastern
Arkansas since Reconstruction.

large stores and supermarkets to do business on Sundays throughout
the year appeared to be passing but was too close to call early
today.
   Republican U.S. Sen. William Cohen won a third term handily,
defeating state Rep. Neil Rolde, a Democrat. With 94 percent of the
precincts, Cohen had 294,663 votes, or 61 percent, to Rolde's
185,189, or 39 percent.
   State Sen. Thomas Andrews of Portland was elected to fill the
1st Congressional District seat being vacated by Brennan. GOP Rep.
Olympia J. Snowe, who is married to McKernan, clung to a slender
lead over her Democratic challenger, state Rep. Patrick McGowan.
   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Snowe had 112,494 votes
to McGowan's 107,663 - a 51-to-49 percent margin.
   The outcome of the three-way gubernatorial race remained in
doubt until shortly before daybreak today, although McKernan had
expressed increasing confidence through the night that he had won a
second four-year term.
   Returns from 94 percent of the precincts showed McKernan with
225,238 votes, or 47 percent, and Brennan with 211,677, or 44
percent. Independent candidate Andrew Adam maintained a 9 percent
margin.
   Brennan served two four-year terms as governor, stepping down in
1987 because of a constitutional provision that barred him from a
third successive term. In the 1986 election, he traded jobs with
McKernan, who had held southern Maine's 1st Congressional District
seat for two terms.
   With 82 percent of the precincts reporting in the Sunday sales
referendum, the pro-repeal forces were leading by a 53 percent to
47 percent margin.

   Republican Dan Coats won election to Dan
Quayle's old U.S. Senate seat, but Indiana Democrats pronounced
their party alive and well after winning several other key races.
   Coats, appointed to the Senate after Quayle was elected vice
president, won the right Tuesday to serve the final two years of
Quayle's term by defeating Democrat Baron Hill.
   In other races, however, Democrats held their seven U.S. House
seats and took one of three away from the Republicans. Democrat
Joseph Hogsett also defeated Republican William H. Hudnut for
secretary of state in a hotly contested battle that may have an
influence on the state's 1992 gubernatorial race.
   Hogsett had 702,746 votes, or 52 percent, to Hudnut's 662,022,
or 48 percent, with about 92 percent of the vote counted early
today.
   Hudnut, a four-term mayor of Indianapolis, was widely expected
to run for governor in 1992 if he had won Tuesday's election.
   ``I think it's an important victory because what it firmly
establishes is there is a healthy, competitive, two-party system in
Indiana,'' said Hogsett, a protege of Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh.
   In the Senate race, Republican Coats, a four-term congressman,
had 790,872 votes, 54 percent, to 682,131, 46 percent for state
Rep. Hill, with 99 percent of the vote counted.
   But Democratic challenger Tim Roemer squeaked by incumbent Rep.
John Hiler 51 percent to 49 percent in the 3rd District
congressional race. With all votes counted, Roemer had 80,422
votes, to Hiler's 77,616.
   Republicans blamed the losses on low voter turnout.
   ``We are disappointed with the Republican turnout. There may be
a number of factors for this, including the budget debate in
Washington,'' said state Republican Chairman Keith Luse.

   Republican Bob Smith says he's just a
``common man'' who will push conservative issues as a U.S. senator,
such as maintaining the defense budget and supporting the ``Star
Wars'' program.
   Smith made fiscal conservatism the overriding theme of his
campaign to replace retiring Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey.
   He voted against the recent federal budget compromise because it
contained tax increases, which he said could be avoided. Despite
that, President Bush campaigned in New Hampshire for Smith, who
stayed in Washington because of House votes.
   Smith says one of his greatest accomplishments in three terms in
the House was his leadership last year in defeating the 50 percent
congressional pay raise, a claim derided by his Democratic
opponent, former U.S. Sen. John Durkin.
   ``I'm a common man, representing common people with common goals
and values and a whole lot of common sense, and I'm real proud of
that,'' says Smith, 49.
   Born in Trenton, N.J., Smith lives in Tuftonboro. A veteran who
served on a Navy supply ship during the Vietnam War, Smith was a
high school history teacher and real estate agent before being
elected to Congress in 1984.
   He consistently supports defense spending, including for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' program, and says
any defense spending cuts due to improved relationships with
unfriendly countries should be gradual.
   Smith opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother,
but says he would support an exception for rape and incest if it
meant enactment of federal anti-abortion legislation.
   He easily won the GOP Senate nomination in September over a
pro-choice opponent. He opposes the Equal Rights Amendment and
favors the death penalty for violent criminals.
   Smith served on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs
committees.
   He and his wife, Mary Jo, have three children.

   Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District has
been predominantly black since 1982, and this year voters elected a
black congressman.
   Democratic state Sen. William Jefferson, a Harvard-educated
lawyer, was elected Louisiana's first black congressman since
Reconstruction on Tuesday when he defeated political newcomer Marc
Morial.
   Congressmen in Louisiana's other five districts ran unopposed,
as did U.S. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
   Complete unofficial returns showed Jefferson with 55,371 votes,
or 52 percent, to Morial's 50,197 votes, or 48 percent.
   Jefferson, 43, succeeds retiring U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, 74.
   Boggs, a popular Democrat, served 17 years in Congress. She was
re-elected three times even after reapportionment changed the
racial makeup of her district.
   Morial, 32, is the son of New Orleans' first black mayor - the
late Dutch Morial. He had hoped to capitalize on his father's
popularity in the district, which encompasses almost all of the
city.
   Boggs had stayed neutral during the race, but was at Jefferson's
side during his victory speech late Tuesday.
   ``She has set the standard by which all great congressmen and
women may be rightly judged,'' said Jefferson.

   Acting Gov. Bob Miller easily won
election to a full four-year term, trouncing Republican Bob
Gallaway by a more than 2-1 margin.
   With 99 percent of the vote tallied, Miller had 207,320 votes,
or 65 percent; Gallaway had 95,649 votes, or 30 percent. Liberal
Party candidate James Frye had 8,041 votes, or 3 percent.
   Miller became acting chief executive two years ago when Dick
Bryan won a U.S. Senate seat.
   Gallaway, a wealthy businessman and newcomer to Nevada politics,
campaigned unsuccessfully on a no-new-taxes platform and criticized
Miller for the governor's anti-abortion stand.
   Voters also gave strong approval to Question 7, which makes it
tougher to change the state's current law allowing abortions in the
first six months of pregnancy and in the last three months if the
mother's life or health is in danger. Sixty-three percent approved
the abortion rights measure, with 37 percent opposed.
   In Nevada's two U.S. House contests, Democrat Jim Bilbray, and
Republican Barbara Vucanovich easily won re-election.
   Bilbray had 61 percent of the vote to Bob Dickinson's 34
percent. Mrs. Vucanovich had 59 percent to Democrat Jane Wisdom's

   A marcher in today's Revolution Day parade fired
two shots into the air in Red Square about 80 yards from where
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders were
standing, reports said.
   No one appeared to have been hit by the shots and the man was
immediately arrested, said Sergei Vozianov, a correspondent of the
official news agency's video branch who witnessed the incident.
   He said by telephone that he could not determine whether the
gunman fired at the Lenin Mausoleum, from which Gorbachev and the
other leaders were watching thousands of marchers.
   The Tass news wire quoted KGB officials as saying the man fired
into the air with a sawed-off shotgun and that no one was hurt. It
said the gunman was from Leningrad but gave no further details.
   But Moscow KGB spokesman Andrei Oligov said the 38-year-old
suspect fired a double-barreled hunting rifle that was shortened to
be more easily concealed. The weapon is readily available on the
thriving Soviet black market, and is often used by Soviet
criminals.
   Oligov said the suspect, whose name was not immediately
released, was questioned by authorities.
   Vozianov said the shots were fired about five seconds apart and
that he was standing 10 yards from the gunman.
   The shooting occurred five minutes after Gorbachev, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and other officials returned to the
mausoleum after talking with some demonstrators in another part of
the square. Journalists standing near the mausoleum heard the shots
over the sound of music playing through loudspeakers.
   Vozianov said about a dozen auxiliary police and KGB
plainclothes agents immediately grabbed the gunman, knocked the
shotgun to the ground and carried the man into the huge GUM
department store, which is opposite the mausoleum.
   A videotape of the incident, recorded by the Tass video service,
showed a plainclothes agent picking the gun off the gray
cobblestones and putting it in his overcoat.
   The TV correspondent said the man was marching as part of a
delegation from the Bauman region of Moscow that marched through
Red Square as part of the pro-Communist demonstration. But Oligov
said the suspect is not a Communist Party member, he said.
   The man wore brown shoes, a blue coat and carried a plastic bag,
Vozianov said.
   The incident occurred on the Soviet Union's most important
holiday, which celebrates the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.
   Thousands of anti-Communist demonstrators filled Moscow streets,
which were already packed with Communist supporters.

   It's getting lonelier at the top, where
President Bush has seen his House veto margin shaken in off-year
elections that also turned down Republican governors in two of the
states he campaigned hardest to hold.
   Bush waged the most extensive midterm campaign of any president
- a year-long effort that included 115 stops for Republicans and
helped them raise more than $80 million. But he didn't have much to
show for it.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson won the biggest of the off-year
prizes, governor of California. That job is vital to Republicans,
who a decade ago watched helplessly as Democrats carved up
congressional districts to their advantage. With a Democratic
legislature, only a GOP governor could block a replay, this time
for a House delegation growing to 52 seats.
   But Democrats will succeed Republican governors in Florida,
which is gaining four seats in the reapportioned House, and Texas,
which picks up three. Bush made three campaign stops for Gov. Bob
Martinez in Florida. And he spent the last three days in his Texas
home base, stumping for Clayton Williams, the Republican
gubernatorial nominee who lost to Democrat Ann Richards.
   Richards, the state treasurer, was the 1988 Democratic
convention speaker who had taunted Bush as a man ``born with a
silver foot in his mouth.''
   Offsetting these Sun Belt setbacks, Republicans gained governors
in Ohio and in Massachusetts and held on to Illinois. Those states,
too, will draw new House districts next year, because of population
shifts that cost them seats.
   For all the poll findings of voter frustration and
disenchantment, incumbent members of the Congress proved, again, to
be almost impervious to challenge. More than 95 percent of them
were returned to Congress.
   Charles Black, spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said he saw ``more of an anti-incumbent trend than a partisan trend
... an anti-Congress trend rather than an anti-presidential
trend.''
   It all added up to a likely Democratic majority of 267-167 in
the House, not counting socialist Bernie Sanders of Vermont. In the
Senate, Democrats gained one seat as college professor Paul
Wellstone ousted incumbent Republican Rudy Boschwitz.
   Those numbers are well below the average midterm losses of the
White House party. But it's the mirror image of a 1988 presidential
election in which the GOP lost congressional strength while the
Bush ticket was winning.
   And even marginal losses could jeopardize Bush's ability to
withstand the two-thirds votes it takes to override a presidential
veto, a tool he has used 16 times so far.
   ``George Bush cannot win the Congress and must no longer rule by
veto,'' said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority
leader.
   Other Democrats turned instantly toward the next election, with
the White House at stake. ``We have an opportunity to do what was
inconceivable six months ago - that is to defeat a Republican
president,'' said Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the
Democratic Governors' Association.
   ``If the election for president were tonight, George Bush would
lose,'' claimed Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman.
   But Edward J. Rollins, who manages the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee - and drew White House wrath by advising GOP
candidates that they shouldn't hesitate to oppose Bush on tax
increases - said he now thinks ``the president is doing fine.''
   Democratic leaders who rank among the likely prospects to run
against him in 1992 were re-elected on Tuesday. Among them are New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn and Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore, who won in landslides, and Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, who didn't.
   Bradley got a surprising challenge from a Republican woman whose
chances against the two-term Democrat had seemed slim to none. She
got little party support, financing was scanty, and she made the
tightest of races out of it before Bradley edged by with 52 percent
of the vote, his showing apparently dragged down by an unpopular
Democratic state tax increase.
   The senator, who came to politics from professional basketball,
said: ``It's been a few years since I was in double overtime.''

<TEXT>
   FBI agents swept through the temple of the
controversial black religious sect known as the Yahwehs today and
arrested several members on a racketeering indictment accusing them
of murder, extortion and bombings.
   The sect leader, Yahweh ben Yahweh, was arrested in New Orleans,
according to his Miami attorney, Ellis Rubin. A top lieutenant,
Judith Israel, was taken into custody in Atlanta. Seven members
were taken into custody at the Miami temple, he said, and others
were being sought.
   The FBI confirmed the Yahweh sweep but would release no further
information; a news conference was scheduled for later today.
   ``They chose to do this in the middle of the night,'' Rubin
complained. ``I feel this is a grandstand act by (Miami U.S.
Attorney) Dexter Lehtinen.''
   Rubin said his client had appeared voluntarily before the grand
jury investigating the Yahwehs, and had agreed to surrender himself
when charges were brought.
   The 54-year-old Yahweh ben Yahweh, who has said he considers
himself the son of God, was arrested at 3:30 a.m. in New Orleans,
said Rubin.
   The Yahwehs, known for their flowing white robes, have been the
subject of controversy for years in the Miami area. Some
ex-followers have been murdered, and other have accused the sect of
hounding former members who broke with the group.
   The Yahwehs have received strong support from many in the black
community, however, because of their strong stand in favor of
family and against drugs. The number of followers has been
estimated at about 10,000.
   The groups owns several businesses and properties in inner-city
Miami neighborhoods, and once took over a drug-infested housing
project using clubs and guns to drive away residents. One Yahweh
was arrested in that incident and convicted on charges related to
the shooting of a resident.
   Rubin has accused the government of persecuting the sect.

<TEXT>
   Voter turnout in Tuesday's elections appears
close to that of 1986, the lowest in nearly a half-century, voting
analyst Curtis Gans said today.
   In the 1986 midterm election, 36.4 percent of eligible voters
went to the polls, the fewest since 1942.
   ``If there are 3 million votes yet to be counted it will be
slightly under 1986, if there are 4 million more it will be a
little over,'' Gans said.
   ``Democrats stayed about the same in turnout, Republicans
declined by very little and there was an increase in voting for
third parties and others,'' said Gans, director of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
   The vote for independents was boosted by the election of
independent governors in Alaska and Connecticut and an independent
House member in Vermont.
   While voting totals were still incomplete, Gans said he expected
the final result to show slight increases in turnout in 23 states
and slight declines in 23 others.

<HEAD>Japan Still Top Foreign Customer of American Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will continue as the No. 1 foreign
customer of American farmers at least through the turn of the
century, maintaining its lead over the European Community,
according to Agriculture Department trade analysts.
   In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Japan once again topped
foreign buyers of U.S. agricultural products at an estimated $8.3
billion, compared with the EC's imports of $7 billion.
   Emiko Miyasaka of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said she expects Japan to maintain its lead over the 12-nation EC
``at least in the 1990s.''
   Miyasaka said Tuesday in a telephone interview that Japan's top
ranking as a foreign buyer of agricultural products appears solid
through the turn of the century despite the EC's plan to unify
economically by the end of 1992.
   Beyond the 1990s, however, she said the situation is too
uncertain for predictions at this time.
   Miyasaka was asked to elaborate on a report by her agency last
week which said Japan ``is likely to be among the strongest export
growth markets'' for U.S. farmers.
   ``This optimism is based on the expectation that Japan's
economic growth, while slowing, is expected to be the strongest of
all industrialized countries, fueling consumer demand,'' the report
said.
   Further, there has been some liberalization of Japan's
agricultural imports through the current Uruguay round of
negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``Since 1964, when it emerged as Asia's first billion-dollar
market for U.S. farm products, Japan has steadily expanded its
agricultural imports,'' the report said.
   Japan moved in front of the EC as the top U.S. farm market in
1988.
   Bulk commodities such as corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, tobacco
and logs are the big-ticket items, but Miyasaka and other analysts
believe there are greater market opportunities for high-value
products like beef, vegetables, citrus fruit, fruit juices and
processed wood products.
   In 1988, the U.S.-Japan Beef Agreement opened the door to
growing sales of beef - from a value of $556 million in 1987 to $1
billion last year.
   U.S. exports of fresh, frozen and prepared vegetables rose to
$253 million by 1989, the report said. Sales of french fries, for
example, rose to $79 million from $37 million in 1983.
   A thorn in this trade development has been Japan's rice policy,
which effectively bars imports, part of a national policy to
protect domestic growers. The United States has called on Japan
during the GATT negotiations to ease the restrictions.
   Miyasaka noted that the U.S. position on Japanese rice is part
of an overall bid under GATT to reduce trade restrictions all over
the world.
   In any case, she said, whatever Japan does about its rice policy
will not keep that country from continuing as the leading foreign
market for American farmers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A plan calling for modest cuts in farm
payments has been approved by the European Community, but U.S. farm
organizations are watching closely to see what happens when it goes
before international negotiators.
   ``It's a step,'' said Dave Lane of the American Farm Bureau
Federation's Washington, D.C., office. ``But it'll still probably
go right down to the wire.''
   The Uruguay round of negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade is scheduled to conclude Dec. 31 in Geneva.
   Late Tuesday, in Brussels, Belgium, the 12-nation EC endorsed a
carefully worded proposal that sought to soothe fears of
governments that their farmers would be hurt by reductions.
   At issue was a proposal to pare farm subsidies by 30 percent
over 10 years, starting in 1986. Some reductions have already been
made.
   The EC proposal, which had been due Oct. 15, will be submitted
to the trade talks as the community's opening position in the final
round of bargaining.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of 29 U.S. farm organizations and
commodity groups on Tuesday released a letter to U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter declaring that no GATT agreement on agricultural trade
would be preferable to one that ``papers over'' fundamental
differences with the C.
   The American farm groups have bitterly attacked the EC's system
of export subsidies and certain other practices that bear on world
agricultural trade.
   ``As the deadline approaches without any encouraging sign from
the EC that problems dealing with market access, export subsidies,
and health and sanitary issues are truly negotiable, we are
becoming increasingly concerned that a final agricultural package
may be fabricated to once again paper over our differences,'' the
groups said.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Grange were
joined by 27 commodity and agricultural trade associations
representing a wide variety of products, including meat, soybeans,
nuts, avocados, raisins, peaches, cattle, corn, pork, turkeys,
wheat, and fresh fruit and vegetables.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Milk production has been rising this year and
so has the output of some major dairy products, according to a
monthly report by the Agriculture Department.
   In September, butter production was estimated at 84.8 million
pounds, up 4 percent from a year earlier. Total cheese output,
excluding cottage cheese, was reported Tuesday at 477 million
pounds, up 6 percent.
   Non-fat dry milk for human food was reported at 50.6 million
pounds in September, up 13 percent from a year earlier.
   But ice cream production, at 62.9 million gallons, was down 1
percent from September 1989, the report said.

   Voters in the nation's capital sent Mayor
Marion Barry back to private life by decisively rejecting his bid
for a city council seat and electing newcomer Sharon Pratt Dixon to
succeed him as chief executive.
   Jesse Jackson also won his first elected office Tuesday, a
non-voting, unpaid ``shadow'' Senate seat from which he will
attempt to persuade Congress to make the District of Columbia a
state.
   Civil rights activist Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, was
elected the district's non-voting delegate to Congress, defeating
Republican Harry Singleton despite revelations that she and her
husband had paid no local income taxes for seven years, beginning
in 1983. Norton received 59 percent of the vote, compared with 30
percent for Singleton.
   District voters also narrowly rejected, 51-49 percent, a
referendum that would have restored a sweeping law that required
the city to provide overnight shelter to anyone who requested it.
The city council scrapped the law earlier this year amid cost
concerns.
   But the day belonged to Democrat Dixon, who captured 87 percent
of the vote to 11 percent for her Republican opponent, former
Police Chief Maurice Turner. She becomes the first black woman to
lead a major American city.
   ``The people of the District of Columbia have ... sent a message
clearly, unequivocally and almost universally,'' Dixon told
cheering supporters. ``They have said it is time to clean house.''
   Dixon also said she would seek Barry's help in calling for the
resignations of all city employees he appointed.
   ``If he (Barry) won't cooperate in that regard ... then I am
going to urge the city council to forge a partnership that allows
us to do what the people of the District of Columbia clearly
want,'' Dixon said. ``They want us to get rid of the waste. They
want new blood. They want a government that responds and works
again.''
   Dixon was swept to victory with her pledge to root out
corruption and waste within the city government. Her chief promise
has been to cut 2,000 middle-level managers from the city payroll,
a move she estimates will save $95 million.
   Jackson won an 11-candidate ``shadow'' Senate race with 44
percent of the vote.
   Many observers saw a clear link between Dixon's triumph and the
defeat of Barry, who had been the dominant force in local politics
since he was first elected mayor in 1978. He was convicted of
cocaine possession last summer.
   ``One jury rendered a partial verdict in August, but today the
jury of the voters issued their verdict, and issued a resounding no
to Marion Barry,'' said Julius Hobson, a civic activist and former
Barry aide. ``This city is tired of him and is ready for something
new.''
   Barry failed in his bid to win a city-wide council seat, despite
his claim to have rebounded from the personal woes that led to his
drug conviction and sentencing to a six-month prison term.
   Barry, running as an independent, finished third with 19 percent
of the vote behind Democratic nominee Linda Cropp, who had 39
percent, and the incumbent, Statehood Party nominee Hilda Mason,
who won 30 percent.
   ``I said that it was an uphill battle,'' a subdued Barry said
after conceding his loss. ``I said it would be a miracle if I had
won.''

<HEAD>Bucking Election Trend, Oregon Voters Approve Tax Slashing Measure</HEAD>

   Oregonians bucked an Election Day trend
and approved a property tax limit out of frustration over a state
political system that is ``paralyzed,'' a leading backer of the
measure says.
   ``People are realizing the political system is paralyzed,'' Don
McIntire said Tuesday night. ``They (state leaders) just can't deal
with this subject responsibly.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Measure 5 had garnered
523,593 votes, or 52 percent, to 481,961 ``no'' votes, or 48
percent.
   Propositions aimed at slashing taxes or spending were also on
ballots in Massachusetts, California, Nebraska, Utah, Montana and
Colorado. All were defeated.
   The amendment would phase in a 1.5 percent property tax ceiling
over five years instead of imposing it from the start. It would
require the Legislature to replace whatever money would be lost to
schools from the property tax cuts.
   The Legislative Revenue Office predicted the measure would cause
property taxes to drop an average of 12 percent in the first year,
and 45 percent by 1995, when the phased-in reduction was complete.
   Measures to limit property taxes have been on every Oregon
statewide general election ballot except one since 1978. Voters
defeated all of the earlier plans.
   This time, McIntire said, Oregonians sent a message to their
state politicians that they no longer believed promises that the
issue would be addressed.
   John Marshall of the Oregon School Boards Association, which
opposed Measure 5, warned that school programs were facing ``major
amputation'' as a result of Measure 5.
   Sponsors said the plan would protect the school system by giving
lawmakers plenty of time to come up with money to replace the
property taxes.
   Opponents, including most of the education establishment, said
requiring the Legislature to replace the money as the tax ceiling
declines would impose huge burdens on the state treasury.
   The good news, as far as most Oregon educators was concerned,
was that voters rejected another ballot measure that would have
granted $2,500 tax credits to allow parents to choose any school
they liked: public, private or even church-related.
   The Legislative Revenue Office estimated the state's cost for
replacing the money lost to schools would be $791 million in the
1991-93 budget period and rise to almost $3.2 billion in 1995-97.
   The school cost replacement money would consume almost half the
entire state general fund by the 1995-97 budget period, according
to the estimate.

   Republican Larry Pressler won a third
U.S. Senate term by his narrowest victory margin since he was first
elected to Congress in 1974.
   ``That looks pretty good to me,'' Pressler said after winning
re-election over Democratic businessman Ted Muenster, who launched
a furious last-minute advertising campaign seeking to tap
anti-incumbency sentiment by charging Pressler was ineffective and
out-of-touch with constituents.
   With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Pressler had 126,123
votes, or 52 percent; Muenster had 108,360 votes, or 45 percent;
and independent candidate Dean Sinclair had 6,113 votes, or 3
percent.
   In other races, Republican Gov. George Mickelson and Democratic
U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson handily won re-election.
   Mickelson received 141,195 votes, or 59 percent, in defeating
Democrat Bob Samuelson, a Democrat, who had 97,939 votes, or 41
percent.
   Johnson captured more than two-thirds of the vote in winning a
third term in Congress. With 93 percent of the precincts counted,
the congressman had 161,124 votes, or 68 percent, to Republican
challenger Don Frankenfeld's 77,464 votes, or 32 percent.
   A ballot measure designed by an environmental group to require
that large-scale landfills get legislative approval passed. With 85
percent of the state's precincts reporting, the garbage proposal
was approved by 54 percent of the voters.
   But voters narrowly rejected a companion measure that would have
further restricted the mining of precious metals in the Black
Hills. Fifty-two percent of voters rejected the mining restriction.

   Republican John Engler ousted Michigan Gov. James
Blanchard by a razor-thin margin today, ruining the Democratic
incumbent's quest for a third term.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Engler had squeaked
past Blanchard, 1,253,469 votes to 1,240,535, a margin of only
12,934 votes.
   Blanchard campaign spokeswoman Katie Wolf said early today that
a recount was likely.
   A beaming Engler told cheering supporters and his staff this
morning: ``I know we've won this. Wake me up when you know the
margin.''
   Engler is the first Michigan challenger to unseat an incumbent
governor since Republican George Romney ousted Democrat John
Swainson in 1962.
   In the Senate race, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting,
Democratic incumbent Carl Levin had 1,450,319, or 58 percent. His
challenger, Bill Schuette, had 1,036,169 votes, or 42 percent.
   Schuette blamed the outcome in part on the nationwide slump in
Republican popularity following the October wrestling over the
federal budget in Congress. Democrats, who held a 60-50 edge in the
Michigan House going into the race, picked up one seat, unofficial
returns showed.
   Blanchard's campaign was plagued by missteps. One of his
television commercials was criticized as racist; he was criticized
for dumping his 78-year-old lieutenant governor, Martha Griffiths;
and his ex-wife wrote a book accusing Blanchard of having an
extra-marital affair with the woman who is now his second wife.
   Early figures showed the Republicans keeping their narrow 20-18
edge in the state Senate. The Democrats kept their 11-7 edge in the
state's 18-member congressional delegation.

   Democrats today celebrated their gains in Congress and the
takeover of governors' offices in high-growth Sunbelt states. They
swiftly proclaimed the midterm election results ``a vote of no
confidence in President George Bush.''
   Republicans countered with the biggest prize of all as Pete
Wilson kept the California governorship in GOP hands. The GOP also
made inroads in the Northeast and industrial Midwest, electing
governors in Michigan, Ohio and Massachusetts.
   In an election framed by fear of recession and war, by
unhappiness with taxes and politicians, governors of both parties
took a beating. That wasn't true in the House and Senate, where
most incumbents won and where the 102nd Congress will look a lot
like the late, unlamented 101st.
   ``We've got a lot to smile about,'' said Democratic National
Chairman Ron Brown as he surveyed the midterm returns on CBS'
``This Morning.'' He mentioned takeaway wins for governorships in
Florida and Texas, and said Bush ``campaigned heavily for 18
candidates and 14 of them lost.''
   Bush spent the morning in the Oval Office and offered no
comment.
   But the Republicans' chief spokesman, Charles Black, said the
GOP had bested the trend for midterm losses, and insisted, ``It's a
good day for the president.''
   Of the 32 senators who sought re-election, 31 won easily. Only
Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz lost - to liberal college professor
Paul Wellstone. In the House, the re-election rate for incumbents
was 96 percent.
   With several House races still to be decided, the likely outcome
would give the Democrats a 268-167 majority, a gain of nine seats -
including Vermont socialist Bernard Sanders, who's expected to side
with the Democrats.
   The three fastest growing states - California, Florida and Texas
- entered the election with Republican governors. The Democrats
captured Florida and Texas, while the Republicans held on to
California, Illinois and led the way into the post-Dukakis era in
Massachusetts.
   As usual, some races were too close to call even hours after the
polls closed.
   John Engler brightened the morning after Election Day for
Republicans when he won the Michigan governor's race, ousting
Democratic incumbent James Blanchard.
   That left three gubernatorial races undecided - Minnesota,
Arizona and Nebraska.
   A half-dozen House seats were unsettled, as well, and in three
of them Democratic incumbents were trailing.
   Lawton Chiles of Florida and Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards
led the Democratic assault on statehouses crucial to next year's
redrawing of political maps to follow population shifts to the
Sunbelt.
   Wilson won the multimillion-dollar battle with Democrat Dianne
Feinstein for California's top job. With 98 percent of the vote
counted, Wilson had 49 percent of the total to Feinstein's 46
percent.
   Republicans picked up some statehouse of their own, electing
governors in Ohio, where George Voinovich defeated Anthony
Celebrezze; in Massachusetts, where William Weld edged out
conservative Democrat John Silber; Vermont, where ex-governor
Richard Snelling reclaimed his old job, defeating Peter Welch.
   But Democratic gains were more widespread. Joan Finney rode
voter anger against GOP Gov. Mike Hayden to victory in Kansas and
businessman Bruce Sundlun unseated Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete
in Rhode Island on his third try. Democrats won formerly Republican
statehouses in Oklahoma and New Mexico.
   Former Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, always a maverick, was
elected governor of Connecticut as an independent. In Alaska,
former GOP governor Walter Hickel was running as an independent and
leading two opponents for the governorship.
   The Democratic-dominated Senate emerged unscathed. Challenges
once thought formidable were swept aside by well-financed
incumbents.
   But the night had its terrifying moments for Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., whose anticipated easy ride to a third term ended up a
cliffhanger before he outlasted rookie Republican Christine Todd
Whitman. She capitalized on virulent anti-tax sentiment.
   Generally, it was not a good night for Democrats with
presidential ambitions.
   Along with Bradley's scare, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York
received a disappointing 53 percent of the vote against a
blundering Republican and a little known Conservative who were
never seen as more than fighting for second place.
   Two other would-be presidents, Democratic Sens. Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee and Joseph Biden of Delaware rolled over token
opposition. Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia was re-elected without
opposition.
   Winning more easily than expected were Republican Sens. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, Democrats Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Paul Simon of
Illinois, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, James Exon of Nebraska,
Carl Levin of Michigan and John Kerry of Massachusetts.
   In Minnesota, Boschwitz spent more than $7 million, more than
seven times Wellstone's budget.
   House GOP whip Newt Gingrich also had a scare. The outspoken
Georgia conservative, who abandoned Bush when the president was
seeking support for a budget compromise that increased taxes,
narrowly edged Democrat David Worley.
   ``If the election for president were tonight, George Bush would
lose,'' said the DNC's Brown. ``More than anything else this
election has been a vote of no confidence'' in Bush.
   ``This is not a referendum on George Bush,'' countered GOP
strategist Edward J. Rollins. ``He runs for re-election in 1992.''
   The results did nothing to strengthen Bush for 1992. During the
campaign, the president made 115 stops for Republicans and White
House aides said his appearances raised $80 million.
   Particularly devastating to Bush was the loss in his adopted
home state of Texas, where millionaire oilman Clayton Williams lost
the governorship after spending $8 million of his own money.
Florida's results also hurt Bush, who campaigned three times for
Gov. Bob Martinez to no avail.
   The GOP's Black, filling in for ailing GOP National Chairman Lee
Atwater. Black, who sought to minimize the damage, called the
results ``an anti-Congress trend rather than an anti-president
trend.''
   ``We beat the historical averages in House races, Senate races
and governorships by taking very minimal losses in yesterday's
election,'' Black said. ``So, it's a good day for the president.''
   In all, eight states will gain and 13 will lose seats when House
districts are reapportioned to reflect population shifts enumerated
in the 1990 Census. Democrats will control the process outright -
holding the governor's office and both legislative chambers - in at
least five of the states gaining House seats.
   The biggest winner will be California, gaining seven House
seats. Florida will pick up four and Texas three.
   The only state where the GOP gained a redistricting monopoly was
Vermont, where it won't matter. Vermont has only one House seat and
that seat was captured by Sanders, who defeated Republican
congressman Peter Smith.
   A record number of women sought office this year, but with mixed
results.
   Richards and Finney were elected goverors and Whitman ran far
stronger than even she could have dreamed. But challenges to
Democratic senators by congresswomen Lynn Martin of Illinois,
Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island, and Pat Saiki of Hawaii failed
to live up to expectations.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., was an easy winner and the Senate
remains 98 men and two women. All three congresswomen who sought
Senate seats were replaced in the House by men.
   The highest profile black candidate was Harvey Gantt, the
Democrat who challenged Helms in North Carolina. Gantt ran ahead in
the polls, but on Election Day, Helms swept to victory.
   The number of blacks in the House increased by two to 25.
William Jefferson was elected to the seat formerly held by Rep.
Lindy Boggs, D-La., and Gary Franks of Connecticut will become the
first black Republican in the House since 1935.
   In the District of Columbia, Sharon Pratt Dixon won the race to
succeed Marion Barry as mayor. Barry, recently sentenced to six
months in jail on a cocaine possession charge, failed in his bid
for election to the city council as an independent.
   Voters in California, Colorado and Kansas City, Mo., approved
measures limiting the terms politicians can serve. The ``Big
Green'' initiative in California was voted down 2 to 1 and
environmental ballot proposals also lost in Oregon and Missouri.
   Massachusetts voters rejected a $2.6 billion tax rollback.

   When it comes to beating incumbents,
governor-elect John Engler wrote the book, or at least the term
paper.
   The 42-year-old Republican launched his political career in 1970
by beating an incumbent state House member after writing a college
term paper on the subject while a student at Michigan State
University.
   Engler defeated an incumbent state senator in 1978, but the
biggest coup came in Tuesday's nip-and-tuck governor's race when he
ousted two-term Democrat James Blanchard.
   Engler's victory returned the governor's office to GOP hands for
the first time since 1982 and marked the first time an incumbent
governor had been bounced out of office since 1962.
   Engler's mother, who appeared in campaign ads, said she thought
he might be headed for higher office. ``I was always telling
everybody when he was 2 years old, `He's going to run for
president,''' said Agnes Engler.
   Engler grew up on the family's cattle farm near Beal City where
hard work was a way of life for the seven children. When he wasn't
working, he was reading or trying to get elected to a leadership
post at school or in Future Farmers of America.
   Engler was active in dorm government at Michigan State, where he
graduated in 1970. Fighting to have guests of the opposite sex
visit was a major goal, he said, recalling how he invented a
curtain to hang in doorways to skirt the university rule requiring
open doors.
   He was married to Colleen House in 1975 and divorced in 1987.
They had no children. Engler became Senate majority leader in 1984.
   ``He works. The guy will work and work and work,'' said
Republican Sen. Richard Posthumus.
   Engler was a strong majority leader who was able to keep Senate
Republicans voting together, but often was an obstructionist, said
Sen. Mitch Irwin, a Democrat. ``John changes his mind and looks for
every technical way to adjust and sneak out of a deal and go back
on his word.''
   What that really means, Engler said, is that he is a strong
negotiator. ``I'd say we've been aggressive and have pursued an
agenda, we have been innovative and novel in developing approaches
to legislation.''

   Democrats bolstered their huge redistricting
advantage by adding two big prizes - Florida and Texas - to the
list of states where they hold a lock on redrawing political lines
for the next decade.
   Besides taking the governorships in those two states -
considered key because together they stand to gain seven U.S. House
seats - Democrats added Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New Mexico to
their remapping monopolies on Tuesday.
   Republicans won a crucial redistricting battle by taking the
California governor's race. The GOP needed it to keep a role in
drawing lines for the seven new House seats California is expected
to gain, because Democrats easily retained control of the
Legislature.
   The GOP also scored victories by winning the Ohio and Illinois
governorships, but Democrats clearly will have the national edge on
the process of reapportioning the 19 House seats that will change
hands due to population shifts of the 1980s.
   Advantages won Tuesday should help cement Democrats as the House
majority party for at least another decade. Democrats also said the
Florida and Texas wins would boost their 1992 presidential hopes.
   ``We feel better about the prospects of fair districts when the
pen is in Democratic hands,'' said Paul Tully, political director
for the Democratic National Committee.
   ``These are not only net victories but victories in places that
because of their population growth will grow more important to the
future of this country and also to the presidential race,'' Tully
said.
   According to preliminary Census Bureau figures, eight states
will gain and 13 will lose seats when House districts are
reapportioned next year. Democrats will control the process
outright in at least five of the states gaining House seats.
   Despite the anti-incumbent mood thought to be sweeping the
country, voters appeared unwilling to turn out their state
legislators. Millions of dollars were spent on legislative races
this year due to their importance in the redistricting picture, but
few chambers changed hands.
   The GOP turned back Democratic efforts to take over the senates
of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Redistricting power will be
shared in all three states, which will lose House seats in 1992.
   ``This proves the Republican Party is alive and well despite the
doom and gloom predicted,'' said New York's state Senate Republican
leader, Ralph Marino.
   Democrats fended off Republican efforts to take over the state
senates in Illinois and Florida and the lower chamber in
Pennsylvania. The GOP was trying to wrest control of the Oregon
House from Democrats, too.
   Arizona's gubernatorial race was up for grabs, as the lead
seesawed throughout Election Night.
   Meanwhile, the GOP lost the Indiana House, but Republicans kept
control of the state Senate. Democrats captured control of the
state Senate in Arizona. A Democratic effort to gain control of the
Washington state Senate hinged on absentee ballots in two
neck-and-neck races.
   In Michigan, Republicans kept control of the state Senate.
   By losing in the governorships in Texas and Florida, the GOP
lost its say in how political maps will be drawn for those ne
House seats.
   Similar gubernatorial wins in Rhode Island, Oklahoma and New
Mexico gave Democrats absolute control there, too. The House
delegations in those states won't change, but Democrats can aim to
draw districts that protect their House incumbents and perhaps
endanger GOP lawmakers. The political lines for state seats are at
stake as well.
   Another victory for Democrats came in Kansas, where they ousted
a Republican governor and gained control of the state House. Kansas
will lose one House seat.
   Election Day began with Democrats controlling 69 of the nation's
99 legislative chambers, and that margin was on track to change
little.
   More than 6,100 legislative races were decided across the
country, but the focus of national party organizations was about 50
races in 10 states in which chambers were held by narrow
majorities.
   The Democrats were in position to draw districts that in 1992
could pad their House majority, now at 258-175 with two vacancies,
by a dozen seats or more beyoe Tuesday.
   The other five House seats are expected to go to Virginia, North
Carolina, Georgia, Washington and Arizona. Democrats already had a
redistricting monopoly in Virginia and kept their sole control in
North Carolina and Georgia. A nonpartisnd the gains madan commission draws
the map
in Washington.
   Among the 13 states losing seats, New York will suffer the most
- giving up three.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are to lose two seats
each. Losing one will be Massachusetts, New Jersey, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Iowa, Kansas and Montana.

   A freight train partially derailed today,
blocking rails and interrupting both north- and southbound Amtrak
passenger service along the East Coast, authorities said.
   Eleven cars of a southbound, 96-car Richmond, Fredericksburg and
Potomac Co. freight train slipped off the tracks about eight miles
north of this rural northern Virginia town, a spokesman for the
railroad said today.
   ``There are no hazardous materials in any of those cars and no
one was hurt,'' RF&amp;P Director of Labor Relations William E. Griffin
said.
   The cause of the derailment wasn't immediately known, he said.
   Several freight cars toppled, damaging both the north- and
southbound rail lines, Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said.
   The accident about 6 a.m. halted the Amtrak Silver Meteor, bound
from Miami and Tampa, Fla., to New York.
   ``Passengers are being off-loaded onto buses, which will take
them to Washington,'' Black said. About 300 New York-bound
passengers were to pick up other trains in Washington, he said.
   Two Amtrak trains originating in Richmond were canceled, and
passengers were bused to Washington, Black said.
   The freight the train was carrying included paper and ground
limestone, officials said.

   Three Republican incumbents lost as voters in 36 states elected
governors.
   Democrat Ann Richards was the victor of the hotly contested
Texas race, defeating Republican Clayton Williams.
   Former U.S. Sen. Lowell Weicker, running as an independent, won
in Connecticut.
   In Florida, Democrat Lawton Chiles unseated Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez and Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete was defeated by
Democrat Bruce Sundlun. Democrat Joan Finney, an abortion opponent,
ousted Republican Gov. Mike Hayden in Kansas.
   But Democrat Dianne Feinstein lost the California gubernatorial
race to Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, and in Michigan, Senate
Republican Leader John Engler narrowly upset two-term Democratics
Gov. James J. Blanchard.
   In Massachusetts, Republican William Weld won his race against
Democrat John Silber. Illinois Republican Jim Edgar defeated
Democratic rival Neil Hartigan.
   In Georgia, Democrat Zell Miller grabbed the seat given up by a
retiring Democrat.

   Democrats retained control of the Senate as incumbents showed
their strength.
   In the most closely watched contest, conservative Republican
Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina defeated Democrat Harvey Gantt,
a liberal who was the first black mayor of Charlotte.
   In a surprisingly close race, Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey defeated Republican challenger Christine Todd Whitman, a
virtual unknown in her first statewide bid.
   Democratic Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois and Carl Levin of
Michigan fought off their Republican challengers.
   The GOP retained all three seats where its senators were
retiring. Rep. Robert Smith defeated Democrat John Durkin in New
Hampshire, Rep. Hank Brown beat Democrat Josie Heath in Colorado
and Rep. Larry Craig of Idaho won over Democrat Ron Twilegar.

   But in Minnesota, incumbent GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz lost to
college professor Paul Wellstone, a political neophyte.

<HEAD>HOUSE RACES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats grabbed nine seats from the Republicans and GOP
candidates captured three previously Democratic seats.
   Voters elected the first socialist to the House since 1929 and
the first black Republican since 1935.
   In Vermont, socialist Bernard Sanders defeated GOP Rep. Peter
Smith and Connecticut Republican Gary Franks, who is black, dashed
the comeback hopes of former Democratic Rep. Toby Moffett.
   An upset in Wisconsin cost 32-year veteran Democrat Robert
Kastenmeier his seat. It went to a former Madison newscaster, Scott
Klug.
   Five-term Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon was defeated in his second
round with Democrat Mike Kopetski, who had narrowly lost to Smith
two years ago.
   Virginia GOP Rep. Stan Parris lost to Democrat James Moran, and
in Florida, Democrat-turned-Republican Bill Grant was soundly
defeated by Democrat Pete Peterson.
   Maryland Democratic Rep. Roy Dyson, troubled by character
questions, was ousted by Republican Wayne Gilchrest.
   In Minnesota, six-term GOP Rep. Arlan Stangeland was defeated by
Collin Peterson in a heavily agricultural district.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the combative No. 2 House Republican leader,
barely survived his rematch against Democrat David Worley in a
suburban Atlanta district.

<TEXT>
   The comfortable margin by which Republican
George Voinovich appeared to have defeated Democrat Anthony J.
Celebrezze in the governor's race surprised even the victor.
   ``Wow, what a victory,'' a beaming Voinovich shouted to a
roomful of supporters in Columbus.
   Unofficial returns showed Voinovich received 1,924,404 votes, or
56 percent, compared with 1,528,414 votes, or 44 percent, for
Celebrezze. Among the ballots still to be counted were ballots
arriving from soldiers in the Persian Gulf.
   Voters soundly defeated an initiative to allow casino gambling
in the city of Lorain.
   Voinovich replaces Democrat Richard Celeste, who leaves office
after two consecutive terms, the most allowed by law.
   ``We fought the good fight. It came up short. I accept it. I
have faith in the voters,'' Celebrezze said as he conceded defeat.
   In congressional races, Democrat Charles Luken edged Republican
J. Kenneth Blackwell in the 1st District. Luken succeeds his
father, Thomas, who is retiring.
   Republican John Boehner defeated Democrat Gregory Jolivette in
the 8th District to succeed Donald Lukens. Lukens lost in the
Republican primary after being convicted of having sex with a
teen-ager. He resigned last month.
   Republican David Hobson beat Democrat Jack Schira in the 7th
District. The incumbent, Michael DeWine, was elected lieutenant
governor.
   Voters re-elected 18 other congressional incumbents.

   Alexandria Mayor James P. Moran Jr. ousted
Republican Congressman Stanford E. Parris, giving Democrats the
majority of Virginia's seats in the House of Representatives for
the first time in 24 years.
   The other nine incumbents held on to their seats Tuesday.
Democrats now hold six of the state's 10 House seats. Ten years
ago, Democrats held just one House seat.
   ``It's a great turnaround,'' said state Democratic Chairman Paul
Goldman. ``We put a lot of effort into the Moran campaign.''
   Moran, who made his support for abortion rights a key campaign
issue, received 88,470 votes, or 52 percent, to 76,391 votes, or 45
percent for Parris in the 8th District race.
   In the only statewide race, Republican U.S. Sen. John W. Warner
won a third term by a landslide over independent Nancy B. Spannaus,
an associate of imprisoned political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr.
   Warner got 872,764 votes, or 82 percent, while Mrs. Spannaus
received 196,161 votes, or 18 percent, according to unofficial
returns.
   ``I'm very honored and I accept the tallies with great
humility,'' Warner said. ``The voters turn to experience'' in
difficult times such as the present, he said.

<HEAD>Goddard, Symington Battle For Governorship</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with new figures and with election officials saying
runoff certain; Picks up 6th graf pvs, ``Almost 7,000..''</NOTE>

   Republican Fife Symington nursed a tiny lead over
Democrat Terry Goddard early today in a nip-and-tuck race for
governor, but the margin was so thin that election officials said a
runoff was certain.
   Symington, a millionaire developer, led Goddard, former Phoenix
mayor, by about 3,589 votes with 99 percent of 1.04 million votes
counted.
   Legislators approved a constitutional amendment require runoffs
in races in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes,
but no laws are in place to implement a runoff.
   Officials say it could be next spring before a runoff is
completed.
   An estimated 300 ballots were reported missing from a Phoenix
precinct considered Goddard territory and nearly 2,000 absentee
ballots remained to be counted.
   Almost 7,000 votes went to write-in candidates, including Max
Hawkins, a former aide to impeached Gov. Evan Mecham. Hawkins
entered the race after the primary, saying he wanted to offer an
anti-abortion alternative.
   Arizona's four GOP and one Democratic congressmen won by margins
of 57 percent and larger.
   Neither of Arizona's two U.S. senators was up for re-election,
and none of the state's congressmen faced more than token
opposition.
   Secretary of State Rose Mofford, a Democrat, was elevated to
fill Mecham's term but didn't seek one of her own. Mecham lost out
in the GOP primary.
   Mofford will likely remain in office until a runoff is held or
the race is otherwise decided.
   Voters defeated two ballot measures that attempted to create a
paid holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
   One King plan went down by a 3-1 margin, as expected. The other,
expected to win narrowly, lost by about 11,000 votes. Observers
attributed the defeat to a report that the National Football League
would move the 1993 Super Bowl from Arizona if the measure failed.
   ``They tried to leverage the public and that just won't work,''
said Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson.
   Other propositions rejected included one to boost the pay of
state legislators by 60 percent to $24,000 per year and a $6
billion, 10-year boost in education spending.
   Voters approved an initiative to use $20 million of Arizona
Lottery money each year to acquire land for wilderness areas or
parks. They also approved a victims rights plan.

<HEAD>Fusion Scientist Hides From Television Cameras, Attends Review</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A panel of scientists today began
reviewing Utah's National Cold Fusion Institute, with a member
saying their study of the controversial research would be open and
objective.
   As the meeting got under way, electrochemist B. Stanley Pons -
who along with British colleague Martin Fleischmann claims to have
produced nuclear fusion in room-temperature experiments - ducked
from television cameras after being spotted sitting on the back
row.
   All the meetings are closed. A sign posted outside the door of
the meeting room stated: ``It is required that only those persons
who have signed a National Cold Fusion Institute confidentiality
agreement attend this review.''
   The panel, hired by the state Fusion Energy Advisory Council, is
comprised of Stanley Bruckstein, a professor of chemistry at State
University of New York at Buffalo; Loren G. Helper, a chemist from
Alberta, Canada; Dale F. Stein, president of Michigan Technological
University; and Robert Adair, a professor of Physics at Yale
University.
   Stein, who was also a member of the original Department of
Energy fusion panel, said although that group recommended against
federal funding for the project, he would remain objective.
   ``I was very open and objective as a member of that panel,'' he
said. He said the group would
   Fritz Will, director of the institute, said he was pleased with
the selection of scientists and predicted the review would move
smoothly.
   ``This is no different from any other scientific review,'' he
said. ``The only thing that makes this one different is the
attention of the media because it involves cold fusion.''
   Will said Pons was expected also to attend Thursday's meeting of
the state Fusion Energy Advisory Council, which is reviewing the
state's expenditure of $5 million in cold fusion research.
   Last year, the claim by Pons and Fleischmann that they had
created energy through so-called ``cold fusion'' created a
sensation in the scientific world. Experts had said that it was
believed the fusion of atoms could be achieved only at extremely
high temperatures.
   But controversy erupted when many other scientists said they
could not duplicate the Utah scientists' findings.
   The furor erupted anew last month when Pons and Fleischmann
failed to appear at a meeting of the fusion council.
   The pair's attorney, C. Gary Triggs, said at the time they were
reluctant to divulge much information because they were working on
a new patent application, but council chairman Raymond Hixson noted
the state held any patents and, in any event, all council members
were sworn to secrecy.
   Fusion, which powers the sun and stars, creates energy by
combining, or fusing, two hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium
atom. By contrast, fission, which powers conventional nuclear
plants, creates energy by splitting atoms.
   Fusion long has been sought as a potential source of cheap, safe
and virtually inexhaustible energy.

<TEXT>
   Followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane shook their fists
and vowed revenge at the funeral of the assassinated militant
leader. Police stepped up security at Arab and Israeli diplomatic
offices and Jewish newspapers.
   Mainstream Jewish leaders in New York and Israel, where the body
of the 58-year-old anti-Arab extremist was flown for burial today,
appealed for calm.
   But the funeral procession in Jerusalem turned violent today
when scores of people broke away from the march to smash shop
windows and chase Arabs down nearby streets. Kahane supporters
moved from shop to shop, asking owners whether they employed Arabs
before smashing windows.
   Along the procession's route, one terrified Arab ran down the
street, followed by several Kahane loyalists shouting ``Death to
terrorists!'' Near the cemetery, an Arab was beaten to the ground
and members of Kahane's Kach movement tried to block an ambulance
from arriving.
   The alleged assassin remained in serious condition at Bellevue
Hospital. El-Sayyid A. Nosair, 34, of Cliffside Park, N.J., was
identified as a Moslem immigrant from Egypt who repaired air
conditioners for the city of New York.
   Police said they had not established any links between Nosair
and terrorist groups.
   ``There will be revenge. We believe in revenge,'' said Sol
Margolis, president of Kach International, the U.S. arm of Kahane's
extremist Israeli party, as thousands of mourners thronged a
Brooklyn synagogue for his funeral.
   ``We don't buy that crap of turning the other cheek. There will
be hell to pay for this affront,'' he said Tuesday.
   ``Revenge!'' said several signs written in red Hebrew letters
outside the synagogue.
   ``Death to Arabs!'' a small contingent shouted.
   Mourners also took up the cry ``Never again!'' - the slogan of
the Jewish Defense League, formed by the Brooklyn-born rabbi in
1968 to take up arms against anti-Semitism in the United States.
The slogan refers to the Holocaust.
   Police stepped up security at the U.N. missions for Israel,
Saudi Arabia and Egypt, El Al Israel Airlines offices and several
Jewish newspapers.
   Dr. M.T. Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations
Committee, said of the threats of reprisals, ``I hope this is just
hyperbole, more rhetoric.''
   Zaheer Uddin, president of the New York unit of the Islamic
Circle of North America, condemned the assassination but said it
should come as no surprise.
   ``He lived by his sword and died by it,'' Uddin said. ``We hope
that Mr. Kahane's assassination will be the last act in the cycle
of violence and counterviolence.''
   The Israeli government appealed for peace as well, and police
and army reinforcements spread out in Israel and the occupied
territories to head off revenge attacks. Two Arab deaths on Tuesday
were linked to Kahane's slaying.
   Kahane, who campaigned to drive all Arabs from Israel as an
extreme right-wing member of the Jewish state's Parliament, was
shot from four feet away Monday night after addressing a Zionist
group at a Manhattan hotel.
   Nosair was shot in the neck by a postal police officer as he
fled. He was charged with murder and other offenses.
   The New York Times today quoted an unidentified law enforcement
official as saying Nosair denied shooting Kahane when he came out
of sedation. His wallet included an ad from a Jewish newspaper for
Monday night's event, officials said.
   Nosair immigrated in 1981 and took U.S. citizenship last year,
authorities said. His American wife converted to Islam and the
couple had three children.
   A motive has not been established, police said.
   ``What we have and all we know is that we have a lone gunman who
committed a homicide in New York,'' said Chief of Detectives Joseph
Borrelli.
   The identification numbers on the murder weapon, a .357-caliber
revolver, had been filed off, making it difficult to trace, police
said.
   Mainstream Jewish leaders, many of whom reviled Kahane for such
acts as a fatal firebombing in 1972 that was linked to the JDL,
appealed for restraint.
   ``The bullet that killed Rabbi Kahane was the opening of what
might fearfully be a wave of terrorism, and collectively we stand
against it,'' said Rabbi Max Shreier, one of a stream of speakers
at the funeral.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``We don't see this as a time for revenge. Now is the time for
restraint.''
   ``The guilty person should be tried and punished under our
laws,'' said Rabbi Irwin Groner, president of the Rabbinical
Assembly. ``But we urge that no further violence be perpetrated.''

   Democrats won hard-fought governor's contests
in Florida and Texas but the GOP countered with major victories in
California and Michigan and a stunning upset in Minnesota.
   In California, Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican, pulled ahead to
capture the governorship of the nation's most populous state,
narrowly defeating Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of
San Francisco.
   In Minnesota, Republican state auditor Arne Carlson staged a
narrow, upset victory over Gov. Rudy Perpich after a tumultuous
campaign.
   Carlson became the GOP candidate when nominee Jon Grunseth
dropped outof the race just nine days before the election after a
series of accusations involving alleged sexual misconduct.
   In Michigan, Senate Republican Leader John Engler narrowly upset
Gov. James J. Blanchard, who was vying for a third term in a
sagging auto economy.
   By mid-morning, Democrats had won in 18 states and Republicans
in 15, while independents won two others.
   Republican George Voinovich snatched the governor's chair from
Democratic control in another large state, Ohio, defeating state
Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr.
   In Illinois, the victory of Republican Secretary of State Jim
Edgar kept the governorship in GOP hands. Edgar defeated Democratic
Attorney General Neil Hartigan to succeed four-term Republican Gov.
Jim Thompson.
   Edgar said he had made clear in his campaign that cutting taxes
now would hurt education in the state.
   ``I think people like to have a public official who will level
with them before the election and not surprise them after the
election,'' he said.
   In most governor's races, however, Tuesday's tide was
Democratic.
   In one of the narrowest of victories, Nebraska Democratic
businessman Ben Nelson defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Kay Orr,
who had sought a second term as the state's first female governor.
A recount was possible.
   In Arizona, Republican real estate developer Fife Symington held
a whisker-thin lead over Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, a Democrat.
Elections officials said a runoff would be held because neither
candidate had received more than 50 percent of the total votes
cast, a requirement for election in Arizona. Democratic Gov. Rose
Mofford will remain in office in the interim.
   Oregon elected a woman, picking Democratic Secretary of State
Barbara Roberts over Republican Attorney General David Frohnmayer.
   She said voters were ``fed up with politicians giving them
fluff'' and appreciated what she said was her ``tell-it-like-it-is
style.''
   Being a woman helped, she said. ``Voters really trust women.
They think they are honest and straightforward. I think there is a
comfort level with women in politics now,'' she said.
   In Massachusetts, Republican William F. Weld came from behind to
defeat maverick Democrat John Silber, on leave as president of
Boston University.
   Weld called his victory ``a referendum on big government,'' high
spending and high taxes of the kind he said characterized the
administration of outgoing Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``They've really been spending money on Beacon Hill like drunken
sailors and that's why people went Republican,'' Weld told ABC-TV
today.
   Former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles defeated first-term GOP
Gov. Bob Martinez in Florida. Chiles' support for abortion rights
appeared to help him against the antiabortion governor.
   But Chiles gave credit to a grassroots campaign that limited
campaign contributions to $100 a person and to voter unhappiness
with ``government gridlock.''
   ``I think it's a vote by people that know government today is
not working,'' Chiles told ABC.
   Kansas state Treasurer Joan Finney unseated Republican Gov. Mike
Hayden, even though her anti-abortion stance lost her the support
of feminist groups.
   In Texas, Ann Richards, also her state's treasurer, defeated oil
millionaire Clayton Williams, whose campaign was marked by campaign
gaffes and an 11th hour disclosure that he failed to pay any
federal income tax in 1986.
   Richards said the result showed ``the strength of government is
based on the power of the people, not the power of money.''
Williams hushed supporters who booed her name and said, ``I will
always cherish the faith that you had in me.''
   In Nebraska, Republican Gov. Kay Orr, the only woman governor
seeking re-election, was locked in a tight battle with Democrat Ben
Nelson.
   President Bush campaigned heavily for both Martinez and Williams
in the closing days of the campaign.
   ``To the degree that George Bush was a factor, he was a
burden,'' said Ohio's retiring Gov. Richard Celeste, head of the
Democratic Governors' Association. ``We have an opportunity to do
what was inconceivable six months ago - that is, defeat a
Republican president.''
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said
the governors' races were not a referendum on Bush but ``have major
implications for him, his re-election race and his party. This has
got to be a major disappointment for Bush and the Republicans.''
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey Jr. was a big winner in
Pennsylvania. Auditor General Barbara Hafer had gone after him for
signing two bills restricting abortions.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete was
resoundingly defeated by Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun. DiPrete,
governor since 1984, lost support when the state's economy went
into a steep decline.
   In Vermont, where Democratic Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin is stepping
down, voters returned her Republican predecessor, Richard Snelling,
to office.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, a potential Democratic presidential
candidate for 1992, breezed to victory over millionaire economist
Pierre Rinfret, who alienated the GOP establishment with his
attacks on fellow Republicans.
   Former Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was elected
governor of Connecticut as an independent and said, ``I hope we
sent a message that dirt is out of politics in the state of
Connecticut.'' He defeated two members of Congress, Republican John
G. Rowland and Democrat Bruce A. Morrison.
   Another longtime Republican, former Interior Secretary Walter
Hickel, also was elected governor as an independent in Alaska.
   In Maine, incumbent Republican John McKernan edged former
Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan.
   Democrat Bill Clinton, who has been governor of Arkansas for 10
of the past 12 years, was easily elected to another term over
first-time candidate Sheffield Nelson.
   Democratic incumbent Roy Romer quickly put down a challenge by
conservative think tank founder John Andrews in Colorado.
   Georgia's Democratic lieutenant governor, Zell Miller, moved up
to the governor's chair with an easy win over state House Minority
Leader John Isakson.
   Iowa was a Republican victory, with incumbent Terry E. Branstad
turning back the challenge of state House Speaker Don Avenson.
Avenson focused on Branstad's antiabortion views.
   GOP incumbent Judd Gregg likewise survived in New Hampshire,
defeating former Democratic State Chairman J. Joseph Grandmaison.
Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. defeated black state Sen.
Theo Mitchell in South Carolina.
   Maryland's Democratic governor, William Donald Schaefer, was a
runaway winner over William S. Shepard, a diplomat from a
Washington suburb who chose his wife, Lois, as his running mate.
   Democrat Bruce King was elected governor of New Mexico for the
third time, defeating businessman Frank Bond. King previously won
the office in 1970 and 1978.
   David Walters, defeated four years ago in a bid to be governor
of Oklahoma, made it on his second try.
   Democratic Govs. Ned Ray McWherter of Tennessee, Mike Sullivan
of Wyoming, John Waihee III of Hawaii and Cecil Andrus of Idaho
were re-elected, as were Republican Govs. Guy Hunt of Alabama,
George Mickelson of South Dakota and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
Nevada's acting governor, Robert J. Miller, was elected to the
office.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on the farm bill:
   There is no more bedeviling piece of federal legislation than
the 1990 Farm Bill.
   It is a complex tangle of economic, political, social and even
philosophical issues, served up as a House-Senate compromise
covering national agricultural policy for the next five years.
   In general, the $41 billion bill seems headed in the right
direction.
   First, it cuts more than $13 billion in subsidies for
agricultural products.
   Second, it contains economic, scientific and environmental
strictures designed to reduce federal costs and to do less damage
to the environment, according to those who put the bill together.
...
   Obviously, a bill so complex won't please everyone. ...
   Our long-term hope is that U.S. agriculture be weaned off
federal assistance as soon as possible and to as great an extent as
possible.
   That is no easy task. Phasing out subsidies and supports has a
serious impact on every segment of the huge agri-business industry.
And there is an impact on the nation itself.
   Food production is part of the nation's muscle. It can be used
as a bargaining chip or a weapon.
   Setting policies that will safeguard production and encourage
innovation without favoring corporations at the expense of family
farms is as tough a legislative job as there is.
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who chaired the
House-Senate conference committee that shaped the measure, said the
1990 bill offers farmers greater choices than earlier legislation.
   The major choice for many farmers is in deciding whether or not
to drop out of support programs to take their chances on the
vagaries of the market.
   A package that encourages, or even allows, such choices seems to
us an improvement over policies of the past.

   The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H., on the firing of Air Force Gen.
Michael Dugan:
   George Bush, sensitive guy that he is, has arranged to have (Air
Force Gen. Michael) Dugan retired at four-star rank on Jan. 1,
specifically so Dugan can get a fatter pension after pay raises for
generals take effect at the start of the new year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney removed Dugan as Air Force chief
of staff in September after he divulged military contingency plans
in the Persian Gulf. ...
   Normally, Dugan would have been demoted to major general and
retired on an annual pension of $60,000. Now his pension will be
about $77,000 per year.
   So much for the hard decisions and the tough reprimands. ...
   The Senate grumbled, but it has OK'd the deal. ...
   Taking extra good care of one's ``career rewards'' is still the
mode on Capitol Hill.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on South Africa:
   The gestation of what President F.W. de Klerk hails as a ``new
South Africa'' may seem interminably long to those impatient for
progress in the moves to make dramatic changes in that country's
social and political structures. But it must be remembered that
neither ... de Klerk nor black activists promised an overnight
miracle when they began their dialogue. The birth of a nation or
what in this case might be called a rebirth does not occur in a day
or two.
   The peace process, which commenced earlier this year with the
release from prison of African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela and the legalization of the ANC, is following a realistic
timetable. Little by little, the pillars supporting the
long-standing platform of white supremacy are being knocked down.
   Much remains to be done, of course. One problem is that the
leaders of the black factions have failed to present a united front
in talks with the government. They expend their energy fighting
each other instead of working together to find ways to replace
apartheid with a democratic system. Given time, however, tensions
should ease. Patience is critical to the birth of a new South
Africa.

   Le Figaro, Paris, on U.S. economic and political woes:
   At regular intervals, specialists of all types announce the
decline of the American empire. This was a theme that surfaced with
the launching of Sputnik, during the war of Vietnam, and the first
energy crisis. Each time, however, the United States succeeded in
picking itself up.
   Again today, the signs of a mini-crisis ... are multiplying. The
value of the dollar - a symbolic thermometer - fell under the
5-franc barrier (Monday). The popularity of George Bush, which
peaked at the beginning of August, has fallen in an impressive
manner the last three months.
   Why this sudden worry? Is it fear of war? Doubtless the
progressive awareness of the dangers of open conflict plays its
role in the present disenchantment. However, polls show American
policy remains popular: 65 percent of American citizens approve the
United States' engagement in Saudi Arabia.
   Thus, it's the economy and domestic policy. American opinion
begins to recognize that (the country) is living above its means.
The battle between Congress and the president over the budget
showed citizens ... the seriousness of the problem. Reducing the
federal budget deficit has become a necessary imperative.
   All of a sudden, American opinion searches its soul. It suspects
politicians of lying. A phenomenon we know well. It's almost the
same these days on both sides of the Atlantic.
   Nevertheless, for George Bush, the hardest things remain to be
done. First to win the battle of the Gulf. Then to wake up the
American decision-makers who appear hypnotized by a cobra of a
different type: Japan.

   The New Straits Times, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on the Persian
Gulf:
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker is spending this week
canvassing European and Arab allies to determine the circumstances
under which they will support military action against Iraq.
   So, with a large degree of certainty, one can say there will be
no fighting in the Gulf for at least another week.
   That is about the only sure thing in the storm simmering in the
Gulf.
   Oil prices and stock exchanges have been on a wild
roller-coaster ride in the past three months, propelled by rumors,
aggressive bluster, peace feelers.
   A lot of the hawkish noise from both armed camps has been part
of a requisite demarcation of entrenched lines and positions.
   But three months after Iraq's engulfing of Kuwait, there has
been little appreciable change in the situation. ...
   For the moment, Iraq is still adamant about regarding Kuwait as
its newest province, but there have been indications that Iraq will
be amenable to negotiations and an agreement which will either
leave it with territory which will justify the costs of the
invasion or a guarantee that Iraq will not be attacked.
   Here is the sticking point, because the forces arrayed against
Iraq must stick by the basic position, an unconditional withdrawal
before there can be talks about anything else.
   The economic sanctions against Iraq will hurt, but precedents
have shown that a determined population, with belt-tightening, can
hold out for a long time. ...
   A war will not just involved blood spilled in Iraq, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, but will also possibly spill over into Jordan,
Israel, Turkey or Syria; not to mention the threat of terrorism in
other parts of the world.
   Which is why one hopes mediators can still find common ground to
explore or one side will soften its positions.
   If both sides refuse to blink, the odds will increase that at
some point, one side will close patience and decided to back up
talk with muscle.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   After apparent wavering in the determination of both Western and
Arab countries to make Saddam Hussein yield Kuwait without
conditions, the American and British governments are rightly
telling the world that, fundamentally, nothing has changed.
   Iraq shows no sign of withdrawing from the emirate, whose people
and culture it continues brutally to suppress. It has failed to
agree to the other basic demand of the international community, the
release of all hostages.
   Saddam still considers his foreign prisoners useful as a means
of disturbing and confusing Western public opinion.
   President Bush's exasperation with the Iraqi leader's brutality
(and) this week's tour of the Middle East and Europe by ...
Secretary of State (James Baker) ... are timely reminders that
force remains the most likely, indeed, almost certainly the only,
means of gaining Iraq's compliance with the resolutions of the
United Nations.
   No sane person could be enthusiastic about the prospect of a war
in the Middle East. But it seems almost impossible to anticipate a
satisfactory outcome of the Gulf crisis without the West making
good its promise to free Kuwait by force of arms, since Iraq will
not retreat peacefully.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on Britain and the European Community:
   (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's) attitude has gone beyond
the realm of cultural idiosyncrasy. It has, in fact, become a
highly contentious issue. The resignation of her deputy, Sir
Geoffrey Howe, is yet another indication of how her stand on Europe
could affect her leadership of the Conservative Party and possibly
the party's prospects in the next general election. ...
   The tide, this time, might run against her. Perhaps, as Liberal
Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown says, ``Europe will be the anvil on
which Mrs. Thatcher's government will finally be broken.''
   That would be a pity, given what she has done to turn Britain
around by putting British industry and business on its feet again
and curbing runaway labor unions. More than anything else, she has
redefined the common ground in British politics, forcing a vast
array of politicians and pressure groups to show their true colors.
   It is an irony that all the good work should today be put in
jeopardy by an unspoken and inexplicable notion that belonging
fully to Europe means that Britain will belong less to itself. The
truth is that only by being a vital part of the new Europe can
Britain hope to maintain the standards of living at home and the
influence abroad which makes the country what it is.

   NRC Handelsblad, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the English Channel
tunnel:
   The Channel Tunnel is a tangible proof of the unification of
Europe. The decision of (British) Prime Minister (Margaret)
Thatcher and (French) President (Francois) Mitterrand in February
1986 to build a tunnel underneath the Channel paired a historic
vision with the courage to take business risks. The tunnel is
entirely privately financed, mostly by Japanese banks, and for a
long time it has been unsure if the construction would ever be
completed because the costs were getting more and more out of hand.
...
   The United Kingdom may be physically connected with the
continent, in many other aspects Mrs. Thatcher is stubbornly
hanging on to British isolation. ...
   The connection with the main stream of the European platoon on
the road to unity threatens to disappear from sight due to this
anachronistic attitude. ...
   Now Europe unfortunately still has to switch lanes midway in the
tunnel.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh lost a vote of
confidence in Parliament today, ending 11 months in office troubled
by increasingly violent religious and political upheavals.
   He was defeated by a vote of 346 to 142, according to United
News of India and Press Trust of India. There were eight
abstentions.
   Singh was expected to submit his resignation to President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman within hours.
   After the vote, Singh's former allies who turned against him
approached him on the floor and shook his hand.
   The vote came at the end of an 11-hour debate in which Singh was
accused of leading the country deeper into class divisions, failing
to control prices and ignoring separatist insurrections in its
border states.
   Before the vote, Singh, who claimed he had tried to hold the
country together, appealed to Parliament to preserve India's
secular government.
   His chief rival, fellow secular politician Chandra Shekhar,
replied that Singh should stop shedding ``crocodile tears'' and
resign to spare the country more bloodshed.
   At least 368 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem riots in
the past two weeks when Hindu fundamentalists defied Singh and
pressed ahead with their campaign to replace a Moslem mosque with a
Hindu temple in northeast India.
   A right-wing Hindu party withdrew its support for Singh's
government, forcing him to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament.
   While the debate was under way, a 17-year-old schoolboy burned
himself to death in New Delhi to protest the government's
opposition to the temple plan. Sanjeev Goel's death was the first
case of self-immolation related to the religious issue.
   In the last two months, at least 150 upper-caste students have
died in suicides or protests against the government's efforts to
reserve nearly half of all government jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   The two issues grew into serious crises for Singh and alienated
him from many members of his own party.
   ``It is not the government which has to be decided on today.
It's the principle,'' Singh said, speaking in Hindi. ``The question
before us is whether anyone's religious view is above the
constitution, whether this country will be divided on religion.''
   During the debate, police fired tear gas to disperse upper-caste
students protesting near Parliament against the job policy. There
were no injuries.
   Chandra Shekhar, a left-leaning political veteran who led the
defection within Singh's own Janata Dal party, has staked a claim
to replace Singh as prime minister. Such a move would at least
temporarily avert new elections.
   Singh called Chandra Shekhar's move ``political opportunism.''
   Chandra Shekhar, addressing Parliament immediately after Singh,
appealed to the prime minister to give up.
   ``Is the state of the country better than it was 11 months ago?
Hasn't terrorism increased? Haven't prices risen? Hasn't tension in
society increased?'' he asked.
   The religious riots and job protests added to Singh's other
problems. Separatist insurrections in Kashmir and Punjab escalated
after Singh took office. Fuel and food prices soared. An economic
liberalization plan stalled.
   The prime minister bogged down in trying to hold together a
fragile coalition of communists, Hindu fundamentalists and his own
faction-ridden, centrist Janata Dal.
   The Hindu right-wing Bhasatiya Janata Party deserted Singh two
weeks ago when its leader was arrested while marching to Ayodhya to
supplant a mosque with a temple.
   The party leader, Lal Krishna Advani, said their opposition to
the government did not stem only from the temple issue.
   ``In 11 months (Singh) has not ... even been able to keep his
ministers together. What can this government take pride in?''
Advani asked during the confidence debate.
   Singh's Janata Dal broke apart Monday with long-time rival
Chandra Shekhar leading the revolt that included several Cabinet
ministers.
   On Tuesday, Chandra Shekhar won the support of ex-Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, whose Congress Party is the largest in Parliament.
   Gandhi lost the prime minister's job to Singh in last year's
elections.

<HEAD>US to Remove All Fighter Aircraft From Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States said today it will withdraw
all of its fighter aircraft and 1,800 Air Force personnel from the
Philippines next year.
   A Pentagon statement said Richard L. Armitage, the presidential
special negotiator on U.S. basing arrangements with the
Philippines, informed Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul S.
Manglapus of the decision today.
   Armitage also told Manglapus that the United States has decided
not to station a squadron of new-generation F-15E fighter aircraft
at Clark Air Base next year as originally planned. The F-15Es were
to replace F-4E aircraft in the 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at
Clark.
   The F-15Es will instead be based in Alaska, the announcement
said.
   The administration announced last April that it would remove the
90th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing at
Clark in May 1991. Wednesday's announcement means the wing's second
squadron, the 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, also will be removed
instead of being replaced by the F-15E squadron.
   ``The net effect of this decision is that by some point in 1991,
the United States will have no fighter aircraft permanently based
in the Philippines, and more than 1,800 U.S. military personnel
will have departed,'' the announcement said.
   The Pentagon public affairs office said it could not immediately
determine how many U.S. aircraft will be withdrawn from the
Philippines as a result of the announcement.
   The Pentagon said the decision was not a result of
U.S.-Philippine negotiations on the future of U.S. forces in that
country. It said the move was ``influenced though not dictated by''
the Philippine government's publicly expressed position that the
U.S. fighters should be removed by September 1991.
   U.S. allies are being told of the decision and assured that the
removal of the fighter aircraft ``in no way diminishes our
commitment or ability to meet our responsibilities in the
Pacific,'' the announcement said.

   A raucous funeral procession for militant Rabbi
Meir Kahane turned violent today when hundreds of people broke away
from the march to smash shop windows, beat Arabs and stone police.
   In a shopping district near the central bus station in Jewish
west Jerusalem, Kahane supporters moved from shop to shop, asking
owners whether they employed Arabs before smashing windows.
   A terrified Arab ran down the street, followed by several Kahane
loyalists shouting ``Death to terrorists!'' Police reported some
Palestinians were hurt in scattered attacks along the procession's
route.
   One Arab was beaten to the ground near the cemetery in Givat
Shaul, and a passing Israeli and two soldiers tried to help him.
When he appeared to revive, members of Kahane's Kach movement tried
to block an ambulance from arriving. Police reports said one
policeman was injured in the melee.
   Elsewhere along the procession route, hundreds stoned a
television building, and a mounted policeman trying to disperse the
rioters was hit by a stone and fell off his horse, Israel radio
said.
   Hundreds of police reinforcements had been deployed to prevent
violence between Arabs and Kahane's followers during the funeral
procession by 18,000 people, but authorities did not interfere
during the window-breaking rampage.
   The main procession of men in yellow Kach T-shirts and
ultra-Orthodox Jews in black coats moved through downtown
Jerusalem. Organizers with megaphones led chants of ``Death to the
Arabs!'' and ``Death to Arafat!'' the PLO leader. Vans carrying
yellow Kach flags led the marchers.
   During the earlier memorial service, one Kach activist vowed to
avenge the slaying of Kahane, who was fatally shot after a speech
at a Manhattan hotel on Monday night. ``Revenge ... the right to
speak will be spoken by a knife,'' he told the crowd of thousands
jammed into a Jewish seminary.
   Security officials, apparently worried by the Kach threats of
violence, deployed police outside the homes of Palestinian leaders.
``We will not allow any riots, and provocations will be stopped
immediately,'' said Jerusalem Police Commander Arieh Bibi.
   Science Minister Yuval Neeman of the ultra-rightist Tehiya Party
was turned away from the memorial service amid shouts of ``leftist,
leftist.'' Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz of the ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party, entered the hall under heavy police escort.
   Neeman later told Israel's army radio he had come to represent
the government. ``I meant to eulogize Rabbi Meir Kahane, may God
avenge his blood,'' Neeman said, using a traditional Jewish phrase
in cases of violent death. ``The rabbi was a proud Jew and warrior
... apparently the anger should directed at the killers,'' Neeman
said.
   Kahane and his anti-Arab Kach movement have been hostile toward
the political establishment which shunned them.
   With Kahane's death, ultra-rightists and religious parties are
expected to compete for the votes of his followers.
   At the burial site, the Givat Shaul cemetery, hundreds of
mourners awaited the funeral procession. Those awaiting the coffin
included legislators Rehavam Zeevi of the ultra-right Moledet
Party.
   Some Kach followers there carried placards reading ``Transfer,''
a euphemism referring to Kahane's key demand, the ouster of all
Arabs from Israeli-held territories.
   The Kahane killing has been denounced by Israeli leaders from
across the political spectrum, and some voices warned that it could
lead to a wave of political assassinations.
   ``This is the danger engulfing us now - that Kahane's murder
will spark a dizzy cycle of further murders,'' the mass-circulation
Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper wrote in its editorial.
   On Tuesday, hours after word of the Kahane killing spread, two
elderly Arabs were gunned down in a West Bank village, and police
said the slayings may have been prompted by Kahane's murder.
   Kahane, 58, preached a violent doctrine of Jewish power. His
organizations -the Jewish Defense League in New York and the Kach
movement in Israel - were known for political violence.
   After immigrating to Israel in 1971, he built a small, but
passionately loyal following, although he was shunned by the
political establishment.
   Israel army radio said today that the assassination changed
Kahane's image in Israel. ``The Israeli media that once avoided
covering him is now devoting a good deal of the time explaining his
dogma,'' the radio said.

<TEXT>
   British officials on Wednesday received a $2.8
million reward from the United States for aiding a money laundering
probe linked to ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   The Customs and Excise office raided the headquarters of a bank
in London and seized records, including details of accounts held by
Noriega, his wife and children.
   The action was taken as part of ``Operation C-Chase,'' a
two-year investigation begun in 1986 into laundering of profits
from South American drug cartels.
   ``We are trying to get to the syndicates and the way to do that
is to go for their assets,'' U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary John
Robson said in presenting the check to Customs office chairman Sir
Brian Unwin.
   The moneywill go toward Britain's anti-drug budget, the office
said.
   In a case stemming from the probe, Luxumbourg-based Bank of
Credit and Commerce International pleaded guilty to money
laundering-related charges last January in Tampa, Fla., and agreed
to forfeit $14 million.
   Others sentenced in the BCCI case included Noriega's former
personal banker.
   Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities in January and is being
held in a federal facility near Miami charged with drug trafficking
violations.

   An 11-year-old girl hanged herself
after being told by her parents to stop watching so much
television, a newspaper reported.
   Belinda Kau Kler was discovered hanging from the ceiling of her
brother's bedroom late Monday, a blanket fastened into a makeshift
noose, according to a report in the daily Malay Mail.
   She was pronounced dead on arrival by a doctor at a private
clinic where she was taken by her father, Harchand Singh, the paper
said.
   The newspaper quoted the girl's uncle, Kartar Singh, as saying
he believed his niece was only trying to attract attention, not
kill herself.
   Miss Kler was watching television Monday night when her parents
reprimanded her and told her to spend more time studying, the
newspaper said. She then locked herself in her brother's room, and
was later discovered by her father.
   Police said were investigating and had not yet classified the
death a suicide.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Unprecedented Resolution to Move Out of Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators adopted a resolution Wednesday
recommending that Parliament and other government offices move out
of Tokyo to help ease overcrowding and spiraling land prices in the
capital.
   The concentration of political, economic and cultural activities
in Tokyo has drawn millions to the city from the fading
countryside, putting a strain on its environment and driving land
prices to unprecedented levels, the resolution said.
   In case of a major disaster under such crowded conditions, city
functions would be paralyzed, it added. The resoution was adopted
by both houses of the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   ``As a basic measure to rectify this distortion, we should avoid
concentration, and to establish suitable functions of politics and
administration for the 21st century, proceed to relocate the Diet
and the government,'' the resolution said.
   Although it does not have the force of law, it urges the
government to ``make efforts to realize the aim of this
resolution.''
   An officer of the House of Councillors, Teruaki Oka, said the
resolution ``aims to reverse the concentration of everything in one
point, which causes rising land prices.
   All members of Parliament except Communist Party members
supported the resolution, he said.
   Moving Japan's capital has been a subject of debate since the
1960s. The government decided last year to move 76 government
agencies out of Tokyo.
   Roughly one in four of Japan's 120 million people lives in Tokyo
or the surrounding area, according to government figures.

<HEAD>US Looks To Gorbachev For Backing Against Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III turned to
the Soviet Union on Wednesday to support sterner measures against
Iraq as the Bush administration acknowledged a worldwide economic
boycott was inadequate to force Saddam Hussein's invaders out of
Kuwait.
   At the top of Baker's agenda is determining if President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who has strongly urged that a diplomatic solution to
the crisis be sought, would support a U.N. resolution authorizing
the use of force.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Baker on Tuesday in
Cairo that Beijing would not block such a resolution. However, the
Chinese minister stressed his government's preference for a
political settlement.
   Baker needs at least as much from Gorbachev, whom he sees at the
Kremlin on Thursday, before the United States makes its move in the
Security Council for a resolution authorizing force and another
demanding Iraq permit the resupply of the beleaguered U.S. and
British embassies in Kuwait, the only two still defying Iraq's
order to shut down.
   After more than three months of a trade cutoff and other
sanctions, the Iraqi president has not budged in his determination
to hold on to Kuwait as an annexed province.
   President Bush and Baker had expressed confidence that once the
sanctions bit, the Iraqi leader would have to reassess.
   But a senior U.S. official who flew here with Baker from Turkey
acknowledged that, despite a battery of 10 Council resolutions,
that point had not yet been reached. Among them is a demand Saddam
release his grip on Kuwait, an oil-rich emirate at the northern tip
of the Persian Gulf.
   ``The sanctions are having an effect,'' he said. ``We've never
disputed that. I think the question is are the sanctions yet having
an effect that would alter Saddam's political calculus, and lead
him to withdraw peacefully and otherwise fully implement the
resolutions. We're obviously not yet to that point.''
   As he left Ankara, Baker said, ``We would all like to see a
peaceful, diplomatic, political solution to this problem. At the
same time, it is the view of our President and the United States
that we cannot rule out the use of force.''
   He added that ``credibility of the United Nations is at stake.''
   One step Baker took in Cairo was to assure Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak of U.S. logistical support to help get the 14,000
Egyptian troops in Saudi Arabia into combat if there was a war.
   Gorbachev's special Middle East envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, was
more positive about the chances for peace, saying there had been a
``big difference'' in the tenor of his discussions with Saddam
between a first meeting in September and a second on Oct. 27.
   ``In the second meeting, there was not mention (by Hussein) that
Kuwait is part of Iraqi territory.'' Primakov told reporters at a
Kremlin reception.
   ``I put it like this to him: `If you do not withdraw, you will
face a military strike against you... He said that he was in a
position to do something. I am still optimistic.''
   Primakov said he did not think the United States opposed his
search for a diplomatic solution. ``I don't think they are against
them. I reported to President Bush and explained to him what I have
in mind, and I didn't see that he was against it.''
   Waiting for Baker at Sheremetyevo Airport outside Moscow was
Alexei Obukhov, the Soviet official in overall charge of efforts to
complete a treaty to reduce the non-nuclear weapons the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact have deployed in
Europe.
   Obukhov handed Baker a sheaf of papers, which the Secretary of
State began to read before climbing into his limousine.
   On Tuesday, a group of U.S. arms control specialists arrived
here to try to put the finishing touches on the Conventional Forces
in Europe treaty to be signed in Paris at a summit meeting Nov.
19-21.
   The negotiators are also working on another treaty to reduce
U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines.

   Democrats padded their House majority in
turbulent elections that cost several veterans in both parties
their seats and threw a scare into others, including Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich.
   Roughly 96 percent of incumbents were re-elected Tuesday, but
some big names, including Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, a Democratic
House subcommittee chairman, felt the wrath of burgeoning voter
disgust with government.
   Democrats were assured of a net pickup of nine seats -
strengthening their majority to 267 in the 435-member House and
heightening their ability to override President Bush's vetoes. In
addition, the election of a socialist who will line up with the
Democrats for organizational purposes gives them an effective
majority of 268.
   Republicans won 164 contests and led in the remaining three
races. In those contests, two incumbent Democrats trailed slightly,
while the third battle was over an open seat held by a Republican
who retired.
   While the GOP loss was well below the historic average of 27 for
a party holding the White House in midterm elections, it left them
with their lowest House numbers since 1982.
   House Democratic leaders touted the results as evidence that
voters accepted their pitch about tax fairness and had identified
the Republicans more as the party of the rich.
   ``The results are clear: George Bush cannot win the Congress and
must no longer rule by veto,'' said Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo. ``Next year, he must come to Capitol Hill with an
action plan for reviving the economy and reworking the system to
the benefit of working families.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said a strengthened
Democratic majority will carry a mandate to undertake ``a serious
review of our national health delivery system.''
   But GOP House campaign chief Ed Rollins said he didn't think
either party should feel comfortable with the results.
   ``I don't think the anti-Washington mood ends today,'' Rollins
said. ``Even though a lot of incumbents are not being defeated,
they're being scared. They're not getting the 60 percent margins
they had two years ago.''
   Notwithstanding the generally standpat nature of the results,
history was made in several respects:
   -Bernard Sanders, the socialist former mayor of Burlington, Vt.,
ousted incumbent freshman Republican Peter Smith to become the
first socialist in the House since Victor Louis Berger of
Milwaukee, Wis., six decades ago.
   Sanders handily defeated Smith, who publicly disagreed with
Bush's position on taxes when the president appeared with him at a
campaign event.
   -Gary Franks, an alderman from Waterbury, Conn., became the
first black Republican to serve in the House since Oscar De Priest
of Illinois during the Depression. Franks vanquished former
Democratic Rep. Toby Moffett for a seat vacated by a Republican.
   -Voters in New Hampshire's 2nd District elected Democrat Dick
Swett, an architect, over one-term incumbent Republican Chuck
Douglas - the first time a Democrat has won that seat since 1912,
the year the Titanic sank.
   Although the Democrats kept intact the majority they have held
in the House since 1954, the results of several contests showed an
underlying voter restiveness.
   In Kentucky, three-term Rep. Carl Perkins won a razor-thin
victory over Republican Will T. Scott, a former circuit judge, by a
margin of only about 2,000 votes.
   Gingrich, the fiery second-in-command House GOP leader, nearly
lost his rematch against Democrat David Worley in a suburban
Atlanta district. Gingrich had led the opposition to the bipartisan
budget deal reached by Bush and Congress.
   Kastenmeier had been in the House for 32 years, but was ousted
by a 37-year-old former Madison newscaster, Scott Klug. Kastenmeier
was chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts.
   In Oregon, an incumbent tainted by the savings-and-loan scandal
also went down to defeat. Five-term Rep. Denny Smith was defeated
in his second round with Democrat Mike Kopetski, who had narrowly
lost to Smith two years ago.
   The S&amp;L mess also helped bring down six-term Rep. Charles
Pashayan Jr., R-Calif. Farmer and businessman Calvin Dooley, a
36-year-old Democrat, won narrowly, in part by pointing to
Pashayan's receipt of $26,000 from Lincoln Savings and Loan
Chairman Charles Keating. Pashayan later returned the money.
   Minnesota voters ousted Republican Rep. Arlan Stangeland, a
congressman since 1977, and replaced him with Democrat Collin
Peterson.
   Stangeland, who is married, was stung by reports that he had
used his congressional credit card to make hundreds of telephone
calls to and from the home of a female lobbyist. Peterson, 46,
supports the death penalty and a constitutional amendment limiting
abortions.
   Conservative Republican Stan Parris decisively lost his seat in
the Virginia suburbs of Washington to Alexandria Mayor James Moran,
who had made Parris' anti-abortion stand a major issue.
   ``The bad news is, in 1974, I got run over by a train called
Watergate,'' Parris said. ``Now, it very much appears the same
train 16 years later is going to run me over again. The good news
is, there is life after government.''
   In Pennsylvania, attorney Rick Santorum shocked seven-term
Democratic Rep. Doug Walgren's bid for re-election from an affluent
district in Pittsburgh. Santorum emphasized anti-incumbent themes
like the congressional pay raise and special-interest political
money.
   And in Maryland, five-term Democratic Rep. Roy Dyson, a member
of the Armed Services Committee, was beaten by Republican Wayne
Gilchrest, a high school teacher seeking public office for the
first time.
   It had been revealed during the campaign that Dyson avoided
service in the Vietnam War by claiming conscientious objector
status - in contrast to his hawkish defense views since entering
the House.
   In the St. Louis suburbs in Missouri, two-term Republican Jack
Buechner was edged out by Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. Buechner said
he would request a recount in light of the 52-vote victory margin.
   Republican challenger Charles Taylor edged Democratic Rep. James
M. Clarke by fewer than 4,000 votes in a western North Carolina
district that perennially features one of the country's tightest
congressional races. Taylor, a former state senator, was beaten
narrowly by Clarke two years ago.

<HEAD>Only Oregon Keeps Tax Revolt Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In Massachusetts and five other states, voters rejected ballot
measures that would have taken giant whacks out of taxes or
government spending. Only Oregon kept the embers of the tax revolt
alive.
   Oregon voters left state educators quaking by approving Measure
5, which will phase in a 1.5 percent ceiling on the property tax
rate by 1995. It will cause property taxes to drop an estimated 45
percent by 1995, and would require the Legislature to replace
whatever money would be lost to schools from the property tax cuts.
   But elsewhere, Massachusetts residents rejected a proposed $2.6
billion tax rollback to 1988 levels. It would have been the largest
voter-initiated state tax cut in U.S. history.
   Opponents had charged that the cuts would hamper such state
services as day care, elderly programs, and police and firefighter
training. Officials said the measure could shut down college
campuses and bankrupt some school districts.
   ``They wanted change but (the petition) went too far,'' said
University of Massachusetts political scientist Paul Watanabe.
   Californians, who started the national tax revolt movement 12
years ago when voters approved Proposition 13, narrowly turned down
a ``Son of Jarvis'' initiative. The measure would have required a
two-thirds legislative or popular majority for new taxes.
California voters also rejected two measures that would have
increased the state tax on alcohol.
   Nebraskans voted against a 2 percent limit on annual state and
local budget increases.
   Montanans defeated a highly unusual ballot measure that would
have scrapped their state income, property and sales taxes in favor
of a ``transaction charge'' of 1 percent on all financial dealings.
Neither backers nor opponents seemed sure whether it would have
raised or lowered taxes.
   But Montana voters also rejected an initiative that would have
raised the state cigarette tax 140 percent to 43 cents a pack, the
highest in the nation, in an effort to curb smoking in ``Marlboro
Country.''
   In Utah, voters heeded dire warnings of fiscal distress from
state educators and refused to abolish the state sales tax on food.
   And Colorado voters narrowly rejected a measure requiring voter
approval for any state or local tax increase. A similar proposal
was soundly defeated in 1988.
   Don McIntire, chief proponent of the newly approved Oregon tax
limit, said he thinks Oregonians are frustrated with state
government's inability to tackle the property tax question.
   ``People are realizing the political system is paralyzed,''
McIntire said. ``They (state leaders) just can't deal with this
subject responsibly.''
   But John Marshall of the Oregon School Boards Association warned
that school programs face ``major amputation'' as a result of the
vote.

   William J. Bennett is resigning as the
nation's drug policy director, the White House announced today,
saying he had helped produce ``a turnaround'' in Americans'
attitudes towards drugs.
   President Bush will accept Bennett's resignation in a ceremony
at the White House on Thursday, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Administration sources revealed his departure plans Tuesday
night and Fitzwater confirmed them.
   Bush is not yet ready to name a successor, Fitzwater said. He
denied that Bennett was leaving because of threats to his family,
saying Bennett ``has lived with threats of a kind ever since day
one of the job.''
   Bennett, the former secretary of education, became the nation's
first director of drug control policy last year at the outset of
the Bush administration.
   ``The president feels that Bill Bennett has provided
extraordinary leadership and service to the country during his
tenure as drug czar,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Two years ago this country viewed this problem as impossible
to deal with and with no end in sight,'' said Fitzwater. ``Today
there has been a turnaround. There is strong bipartisan support in
the Congress for drug programs and there is growing evidence that
society is beginning to turn away from the drug scourge.''
   Earlier, an administration source said Bennett was leaving after
18 months in office with a feeling of accomplishment.
   ``He set out to do a task, he's done it, and he's seeing the
fruition of it,'' the source said Tuesday. ``Now he's going on to
the next phase of his life.'' The source said Bennett has no new
job lined up.
   The source said Bennett also has been subject to increasing
threats to his safety recently.
   Bennett, 47, designed the nation's anti-drug strategy, which
focuses heavily on drug users as the fuel that keep international
gangster organizations in business. His plans devoted about 70
percent of the money to law enforcement, the rest to treatment and
education. But treatment programs grew the fastest under Bennett's
guidance.
   The voluble Bennett has used his job of director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy as a bully pulpit, much as he did
when he was education secretary under President Reagan.
   He traveled the nation, praising anti-drug activists and urging
tougher drug laws and novel punishments as well as treatment and
education programs. He was critical of Congress when it tried to
change his plans and called calls for drug decriminalization
``stupid and morally atrocious.''
   One reason Bennett is leaving is concern for his safety and that
of his wife and young sons, the source said.
   ``There have been some threats, bomb threats, personal
threats,'' the source said. On a recent swing through Alaska, where
he campaigned for a ballot measure to re-criminalize marijuana, a
third bodyguard was assigned.
   The source said the concerns ``have been building. I've seen it
start to eat away at him.''
   When Bennett was confirmed in March 1988, many said fighting the
war on drugs would prove a hopeless task. But he said in ceremony
in September that progress had been made, that ``the drug problem -
in general, nationwide - is no longer getting worse, and in some
very significant aspects it is now getting better. Not victory, but
success.''
   The ceremony called attention to signs that the drug crisis,
particularly the cocaine problem, appeared to be abating. Cocaine
prices were higher and purity levels lower, emergency room cases
were fewer and Americans were turning against illegal drugs of all
kinds, polls found.
   Bennett said that as cocaine supplies were restricted, violence
among dealers could increase with ``more dogs chasing fewer
bones.'' But he said the overall signs showed the problem is
``certainly not getting worse.''
   In recent months, Bennett has found himself urging the public to
keep its attention focused on the drug war and not be diverted by
the Persian Gulf crisis and other issues.
   ``It is possible for a great nation to take care of its own kids
and its own principles in more than one place at one time,'' he
said.
   Bennett said he was unsure how long he expected to stay in his
job, but said, ``I'll tell you, there's more for me to do, that's
for sure.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Hostages Will Be Freed If London Restores Syrian Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British hostages held in Lebanon will be
freed if London restores relations severed with Damascus four years
ago amid allegations of Syrian involvement in terrorism, a
government newspaper said Wednesday.
   In a front-page editorial, the Tishrin daily accused British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government of blocking efforts
to free the four Britons, who are among 13 Westerners held by
pro-Iranian Moslem extremists.
   The editorial, signed by the newspaper's editor-in-chief,
Mohammed Kheir Al-Wadi, said Britain ``has not done a thing for the
release of the missing hostages.''
   ``Had the British government been concerned about its citizens,
it would have reconciled with Syria,'' he wrote. ``Such a move will
create the appropriate atmopshere for Syria to look for the
hostages and secure their release.''
   It was the first time the government-controlled news media has
openly linked the hostage issue to renewing diplomatic ties
ruptured in November 1986 after London blamed Syria for an attempt
to blow up an Israeli jetliner at Heathrow Airport.
   In London, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ``Syria is
an important country in the Middle East and we would like better
relations, but there are obstacles.''
   The spokesman said Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd ``has quite
deliberately refused'' to specify what Britain's conditions are for
renewing ties. Last month, Hurd said the 1986 El Al affair remained
the main obstacle.
   Syria has denied it was involved in the terror attempt, calling
it an Israeli plot to damage Syria's image in the West. The Tishrin
editorial repeated the claim that Syria was set up.
   ``When this became apparent to Western governments, they
improved relations with Syria, except for Mrs. Thatcher who moved
in the opposite direction,'' it said.
   The United States recalled its ambassador from Damascus after
the British accusations. But he was sent back a few months later,
mainly to follow up on American hostages in Lebanon.
   Tishrin referred to a recent European Community vote, taken
under British pressure, to maintain a ban on arms sales to Syria
and keep restrictions on the number of Syrian officials in Europe.
   ``The British government's intransigence and confrontational
attitudes ... are delaying the solution of acute problems,'' it
said.
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, with 40,000 troops
deployed in the civil war-plagued country. Damascus also is a close
ally of Iran, which backs Shiite Moslem factions holding the
Western hostages.
   In addition to the Britons, the hostages are six Americans, two
Germans and an Italian. American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest held.
   Syria was involved in the release of American hostages Robert
Polhill and Frank Reed in April, and Irishman Brian Keenan in
August.
   The editorial deflated speculation that a British hostage,
possibly Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, would be freed
following London's restoration of ties with Iran in September.
   Waite, 51, disappeared in Beirut on Jan 20, 1987, while trying
to negotiate the release of American hostages.
   The other missing Britons are Alec Collett, 68, a New York-based
journalist; John McCarthy, 33, a reporter for the London-based
World-Wide Television; and Jack Mann, 76, a former air force pilot
who had been living in Lebanon for two decades.
   The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems claimed it
executed Collett in retaliation for U.S. air raids on Libya. It
released a videotape purporting to show him hanged, but no body was
produced.

   Iraq said today it would free 120 more hostages, most of them
Germans but including a few Americans, and 74 Japanese nationals
flew to freedom after three months of captivity in Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said 100 Germans would be freed
at the intervention of former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt,
who met with President Saddam Hussein today.
   The report said the move reflected the Baghdad government's
``appreciation for the German policy which does not support trends
toward war.''
   It said 20 hostages of other nationalities would be freed as
well, including an unspecified number of Americans, Britons,
Italians and others.
   The announcement did not say when they would be freed.
   But the release of the Japanese hostages who left Baghdad today
had been announced only a day earlier.
   The White House said today that former foreign government
officials who have traveled to Baghdad on hostage-freeing misions
``are being used'' by Saddam for propaganda purposes. Presidential
spokeman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reporters, specifically
mentioned Brandt's trip.
   He also accused Saddam of ``toying with the emotions'' of the
families of captives.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today that ``time is
running out'' for Saddam and force will be used unless he withdraws
soon from Kuwait.
   ``He has been warned,'' she said in a speech to lawmakers.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, said the use
of military force against Iraq cannot be ruled out. Baker is on a
weeklong mission sounding out allies on their willingness to go to
war. He was in Turkey today and will stop in Moscow, Paris and
London.
   He told reporters in Ankara that the United States seeks a
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. But he added that ``we cannot
rule out the possible use of force before we see that the matter is
resolved peacefully.''
   Baker also denied reports he gave Iraq an ultimatum to get out
of Kuwait in the next two weeks. The reports by Israel army radio
and stations in Luxembourg and Monte Carlo said Baker had asked his
Chinese counterpart, Qian Quichen, to tell Saddam Hussein that U.S.
forces would attack if he didn't comply. Baker met with Qian in
Cairo, Egypt, on Tuesday.
   Qian indicated to Baker on Tuesday that Beijing would not stand
in the way of any U.N. vote authorizing a military strike to force
Iraq out of Kuwait, U.S. officials said. But Qian, who met for two
hours with Baker in Cairo, did not explicitly approve sending
troops into action.
   ``We'll have to wait and see,'' Qian told reporters. China is
one of the five U.N. Security Council members with veto power over
resolutions.
   Qian met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today.
   U.S. officials said Mubarak agreed during a meeting with Baker
that ``a partial solution'' to the Persian Gulf crisis was
unacceptable, that U.N. resolutions demanding an Iraqi withdrawal
be implemented fully.
   The officials insisted, however, that Baker had not discussed a
timetable with Mubarak for any attack.
   Iraq seized oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2 and then annexed it. The
United Nations responded by mandating an embargo on trade with Iraq
and ordering it responsible for war damages.
   The Japanese hostages who were freed today left Baghdad aboard a
Japan Air Lines charter flight with former Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, who secured their release. Japanese Embassy
officials said the plane would make at least one refueling stop en
route to Tokyo, but would not say where.
   Iraq had said 77 Japanese nationals were free to go, but only 74
wound up leaving with Nakasone. The embassy officials, requesting
anonymity, said three Japanese businessmen who had been given
permission to leave changed their minds and decided to stay on in
Baghdad to finish their businesses.
   ``They opted out,'' one embassy official insisted. ``The Iraqis
did not change their mind, the three businessmen did.''
   Japanese officials denied there was any link between Iraq's
agreement to free its citizens and the government's abandoning of a
plan to deploy troops to the Persian Gulf.
   Despite the European Community's disapproval of individual
hostage-freeing missions, such trips are becoming increasingly
common.

   The founder of a black religious sect who calls
himself the son of God and at least 12 followers were arrested
today on an indictment accusing the group of 14 murders, including
the slaying of a ``white devil'' as an initiation rite.
   Yahweh ben Yahweh, born Hulon Mitchell Jr., was arrested in New
Orleans, according to his Miami attorney, Ellis Rubin. A top
lieutenant, Judith Israel, also known as Linda Gaines, was taken
into custody in Atlanta.
   FBI agents swept the Miami-based group's ``Temple of Love'' and
took seven members into custody there, said Rubin. p.m. Index:

   This time, The Hunk didn't flunk.
   John F. Kennedy Jr. told his bosses in the district attorney's
office Wednesday he passed the state bar exam on the third try.
   ``I am pleased by this news,'' said District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau. ``We never doubted that he would pass.''
   Kennedy's passing grade on the July exam means he gets to keep
his job as an assistant district attorney, and that he will get a
$3,000 raise to $33,000 a year.
   When he is formally sworn in as a member of the New York bar, he
will get an additional $1,000. The raises are standard at Kennedy's
level, said office spokesman Gerald McKelvey.
   Kennedy joined Morgenthau in 1989 after graduating from New York
University Law School.
   It was announced Friday that Kennedy had passed the Connecticut
bar exam, but that would not have saved his job, which carries a
proviso of three strikes and you're out.
   Kennedy, son of the slain president, has been listed as ``one of
the 50 most beautiful people in the world'' by People magazine and
one of the sexiest men by US magazine.
   His sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, passed the bar exam on
her first try, and was recently admitted to New York practice.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Operation Desert Shield troops will no longer
heave pails of sand to pump themselves up, thanks to actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
   He rounded up 50 tons of weightlifting equipment for the U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``After learning that soldiers were using makeshift weights to
keep fit, he spearheaded a campaign to secure donations from
companies who manufacture aerobic and weightlifting equipment,''
publicist Charlotte Parker said Wednesday.
   More than 100,000 pounds of dumbbells, bench boards, leg
presses, leg extensions, power squat racks, cycle machines and
tread mills have been donated, Schwarzenegger's publicist said.
   The exercise equipment will be shipped in time for Thanksgiving.

   BROKEN HILL, Australia (AP) - Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of
York, told inquisitive school children Wednesday she has to mind
her royal manners because the media dogs her footsteps.
   Broadcasting to 180 students over a radio network spanning
thousands of miles of outback, the duchess was quizzed by seven
pupils on the talkback system called School of the Air.
   A group of students also came to the school studio especially
for the one-day royal visit to this small mining center of Broken
Hill.
   ``You always have to remember that they're there watching,'' she
responded when asked what she thought of the media attention she
attracts. ``If you trip up down the steps, they'll criticize you
for tripping down the steps, so you have to be careful.''
   The duchess, the wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, sidestepped
other questions, including how much money she has and which horse
she backed in the Melbourne Cup, Australia's premier racing event
that she attended the day before.

   PARIS (AP) - Prince Karim Aga Khan, the Ismaili Moslem spiritual
leader and one of the world's richest men, was given France's
highest civilian honor Wednesday for his philanthropic works.
   ``France pays homage to a long continuity of eminent service
rendered to humanity,'' President Francois Mitterrand said in
bestowing the title during a private ceremony at the Elysee Palace.
   The Aga Khan, 57-year-old spiritual leader of 15 million Ismaili
Moslems in 25 countries, lives near Paris and is famed for his
stable of race horses.
   His philanthropy includes farm funding, road building and other
development projects in Africa and Asia.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal was given an
honorary doctorate Wednesday by Vienna University.
   Students proposed awarding the 81-year-old Holocaust survivor
the doctorate in philosophy, said University Rector Karl Wernhart.
   Wiesenthal said his 4{ years in a Nazi concentration camp made
him realize that ``survival is a privilege.''
   He vowed to continue to work for justice and freedom and to
remain ``a voice of all those people whose mouths were closed
forever'' in Nazi death camps.
   Wiesenthal, by his own reckoning, has brought some 1,100 Nazi
fugitives to justice since the end of World War II. His most
celebrated triumph was helping the Israelis in 1960 to capture
Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the Holocaust.

<HEAD>Three Convicted in Nation's Largest Cocaine Seizure</HEAD>

   Three men were convicted in connection with
the nation's largest cocaine seizure on record, but the jury
deadlocked on charges against three other defendants.
   Prosecutors said they would seek a retrial for the three not
convicted. The federal jury deadlocked Tuesday 8-4 in favor of
conviction.
   The case stemmed from the September 1989 seizure of 20 tons of
cocaine in a warehouse in suburban Sylmar, 25 miles northwest of
downtown.
   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. declared a mistrial for
Hector Tapia Anchondo, 39; Hugo Fernando Castillon Alvarez, 33; and
Miguel Garcia Chavez, 35.
   Sentencing for the other three defendants was set for Jan. 28.
Each faces a maximum prison term of 10 years to life and fines up
to $4 million.
   The jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges against Carlos
Tapia Ponce, 69, and his two sons-in-law, Jose Ignacio Mauricio
Monroy Iniguez, 37, and James Romero McTague, 42, the only
U.S.-born defendant.
   During the trial, which started Sept. 19, prosecutors
characterized Tapia, a retired Mexican customs inspector, as ``the
overseer and patriarch'' of the drug trafficking ring that used
big-rig trailers to ship 77 tons of cocaine from El Paso, Texas, to
the Sylmar warehouse before the raid.
   A Nov. 19 hearing was scheduled to set a new trial date.
   Each defendant except Chavez was charged with one count of
conspiracy and one count of possession with intent to distribute
the cocaine.
   McTague also was charged with possessing and intending to sell
44 pounds of cocaine, which was the sole charge against Chavez.
   At the time of the seizure, federal officials said the 20 tons
of cocaine was the largest amount of the drug ever impounded by
authorities, and that it represented about 5 percent of estimated
annual global production of the drug.
   The street value of the seized cocaine was estimated by
authorities from $2 billion to $20 billion.
   Authorities also seized $12 million in cash during the raid.

   Joe Smitherman, the seven-term mayor of
Selma, underwent successful treatment Wednesday for a blocked
coronary artery after suffering a heart attack, hospital officials
said.
   Smitherman was mayor during the 1965 civil rights marches and
again had to deal with months of racial protests earlier this year
over the firing of the city's first black school superintendent. He
was admitted to University Hospital on Tuesday afternoon
complaining of chest pains, hospital spokesman Hank Black said.
   Smitherman, 60, suffered a heart attack, but doctors
successfully cleared a blocked artery Wednesday with a tube, Black

   He said Smitherman was in fair condition and could return home
in a few days.

<HEAD>Barbara Roberts Got Late Start in Oregon Governor's Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Barbara Roberts never made it a secret she
wanted to be the first woman governor of Oregon.
   But she didn't expect to be running for the job this year. She
jumped into the race after Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt
unexpectedly announced in February he wouldn't seek a second term.
Roberts, a Democrat, moved to fill the void. On Tuesday, she
defeated Republican Dave Frohnmayer.
   Roberts, 53, grew up in a small Willamette Valley town and ended
up in Portland, where she began her political career.
   Her first exposure to the Capitol was in the early 1970s, when
she helped get a bill passed requiring special education classes
for emotionally handicapped children in public schools.
   She launched the effort because the older of her two sons is
autistic. She was a divorced mother ``with two kids and no child
support,'' she says.
   ``I found out that I could come into that process and literally
change the lives of thousands of kids,'' she says.
   She got help in her lobbying from veteran Democratic state Sen.
Frank Roberts of Portland, and they eventually married.
   Barbara Roberts' first elective office was a post on a
Portland-area school board in 1973.
   She served an appointed term as a Multnomah County commissioner
and in 1980 won the first of two terms in the Oregon House. In her
second term, she was the first woman to be House majority leader.
   Roberts was elected secretary of state in 1984 and easily won
re-election in 1988. The state constitution prohibits a third
successive term, and she had her eye on running for governor in
1994.
   Roberts is energetic and a vigorous campaigner. She established
familiarity with voters after crisscrossing the state on the speech
circuit many times as secretary of state.
   She's an unabashed liberal who emphasizes concern for the
downtrodden. She says she rejects the label, however, if it's meant
as support of higher taxes and more regulation of business.
   Her Republican opponent, Dave Frohnmayer, portrayed her as a
free spender with budget-busting plans.
   Roberts' candor sometimes left supporters nervous.
   Months ahead of the election, she endorsed a controversial
ballot measure to shut down the state's only nuclear power plant.
Later, she came out for a hard-fought measure to impose strict
recycling standards on packaging.
   Frohnmayer opposed both.

<TEXT>
   Mayor-elect Sharon Pratt Dixon on Wednesday
wasted no time acting on her pledge to overhaul the District of
Columbia government, urging that all of Mayor Marion Barry's
political aides quit.
   ``I am going to indicate to the mayor that I would like for him
to ask for the resignations of all the political appointees,''
Dixon said in the aftermath of her landslide victory over
Republican nominee Maurice Turner.
   ``If he won't cooperate in that regard ... then I am going to
urge the city council to forge a partnership that allows us to do
what the people of the District of Columbia clearly want.''
   The mayor-elect did not elaborate on what type of legislative
action she would seek from the council, but that 13-member panel
has in recent weeks passed bills designed to limit Barry's spending
authority during his last days in office.
   Several legislators said they were worried Barry would reward
friends and political cronies with pay raises and city contracts
while he still had the power to do so.
   Barry, who was defeated in his bid for a seat on the city
council, said during his concession speech Tuesday that he intended
to cooperate in the transition to the Dixon administration.
However, he declined to provide specifics and refused comment
Wednesday on Dixon's request for the departure of his political
lieutenants.
   Barry has appointed about 200 of his aides to high-paying
government posts. Many of Barry's top aides are also career
government workers and are eligible under city personnel rules to
take other government posts if Dixon wishes to replace them.
   Dixon, who won with 86 percent of the vote to Turner's 11
percent, becomes the first black female to lead a major American
city.
   She won after promising sweeping reform in a government many
believe is bloated and inefficient, including a pledge to cut 2,000
middle-level managers from the district's 48,000-member work force.

<TEXT>
   At an unusual prayer breakfast, South
African Foreign Minister Pik Botha urged three black African
leaders Wednesday to ``join hands'' in regional cooperation.
   Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the
heads of state as ``my African brothers'' during the informal
meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter.
   The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of
the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led
efforts to end apartheid in South Africa.
   The other two leaders were President Joaquim Chissano of
Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the
51-member Organization of African unity.
   President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting
``marks a new era in Africa.''
   The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a
further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its
anti-apartheid neighbors.
   Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk's recent
steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the
African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including
the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency
in black townships.
   The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its
headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this
year.
   Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid,
said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and
reconciliation.''
   Botha told the black African leaders that South Africa could
help economic development in the largely impoverished region,
adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.''
   ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa
and we are ready to play that role,'' Botha said.
   Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a
meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen
two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said,
but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host.
   Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana,
Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were
invited but did not attend.

<TEXT>
   NASA today set Nov. 15 as the launch
date for space shuttle Atlantis and its classified cargo, a spy
satellite that needed last-minute repairs and caused a one-week
flight delay.
   Atlantis had been scheduled to blast off Friday on the secret
military mission. But the Air Force last week delayed the flight
because of undisclosed problems that arose during cargo testing.
   The satellite aboard Atlantis reportedly is to spy on Iraqi
forces. Liftoff is scheduled for sometime between 6:30 p.m. and
10:30 p.m. EST; the exact time will not be divulged until nine
minutes beforehand.
   Atlantis was supposed to carry the spacecraft into orbit in
July, weeks before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but hydrogen leaks grounded
the shuttle. During the standdown, the satellite reportedly was
modified for information gathering in the Persian Gulf.
   Atlantis was cleared for flight during an Oct. 24 fueling test
that found no significant leakage. The shuttle Columbia, also
crippled for months by leaking hydrogen, was found to be free of
dangerous leaks during a similar test last week.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to send
Columbia on a long-delayed astronomy mission in early December. The
seven-man crew has endured four launch attempts since May, three of
which were halted by leaking hydrogen in the final hours before
liftoff.
   NASA likes to have at least three weeks between missions so
flight data can be analyzed. Officials have said they will try to
shorten that period by about a week so Columbia can be back before
Christmas, and the agency can shut down certain operations for
routine maintenance and avoid holiday pay.
   Before hydrogen leaks crippled two of NASA's three shuttles, the
space agency had planned nine launches for 1990. Six will be
achieved if Atlantis and Columbia go up as planned.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader to Visit Germany to Sign Treaty, Seek Economic Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Enjoying enormous popularity among Germans but
facing problems at home, Soviet President President Mikhail
Gorbachev plans to spend the first anniversary of the Berlin Wall
opening looking for economic help.
   Gorbachev, scheduled to arrive in Bonn on Friday, is likely to
be heaped with praise for his role in ending the Cold War. He may
get a cooler response to his requests for support for reform
efforts.
   He is believed to be seeking more credits from Germany to help
the Soviet transition to a market economy and modernize nuclear
power plants, among other programs.
   But German businessmen who were eager to rush into partnerships
with the Soviets last year, are more cautious now with reports of
growing Soviet unrest.
   ``The Soviet Union's internal development is so unclear that it
does not create a good climate for investments,'' says Karl-Hermann
Fink, managing director of the German East-West Trade Committee.
   ``We are heading for trouble. This is too much, too fast,'' said
Heinrich Vogel, head of the Federal Institute for Soviet and
International Studies. ``Nobody knows who will stand behind what is
decided in Moscow.''
   On Friday - the anniversary of the first openings in the wall
that divided Berlin - Gorbachev is scheduled to sign a
Soviet-German treaty that includes a non-aggression pact and other
provisions for financial and technological help for the Soviet
Union.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev plans to visit Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
hometown of Oggersheim near the Rhine River for informal talks.
   Although economic issues are likely to dominate the two-day
visit, other topics likely to be raised include the fate of Soviet
soldiers who have deserted in what used to be East Germany.
   The 20-year accord Gorbachev and Kohl plan to sign Friday is one
of the most expansive agreements ever worked out between the two
nations.
   The countries will pledge not to use force against each other
and to respect the boundaries of all countries in Europe.
   The treaty also creates the framework for German financial and
technological help for the Soviet Union, and for intensified
political and cultural ties.
   Both nations have strong historical connections, in peace and in
war.
   Writers Aleksandr Pushkin and Johann Goethe became close friends
in Weimar. Novelist Ivan Turgenev called Germany his ``second
fatherland.'' Russian writer Boris Pasternak studied philosophy in
Marburg.
   For Germans, Russia represented a land of great economic
opportunity with wide-open spaces their nation lacked.
   Catherine the Great, the German-born ruler of Russia at the end
of the 18th century, invited her former countrymen to settle land
along the Volga river.
   Their descendants, repressed under Stalin, now number in the
millions. Many want to emigrate to Germany.
   The 1922 Treaty of Rapallo, which outlined close military and
political consultations between Germany and the young Soviet state,
alarmed the rest of Europe. The word ``Rapallo'' still signifies
something sinister.
   Strong economic links emerged again with the foundation in 1949
of the Communist state of East Germany, which became the Soviet's
largest trading partner.
   Moscow was reluctant to agree to the Oct. 3 German
reunification, but agreement finally came in July.
   Now, some of Germany's European allies are worried about its
relationship with the Soviet Union.
   The French press referred to the July meeting between Gorbachev
and Kohl in the Soviet leader's hometown of Stavropol as
``Stavrapallo.''
   Germany has sought to reassure its western neighbors its
interest in the Soviet Union in no way reduces the commitment to
European integration.
   ``Germans have a special responsibility for their eastern
neighbors,'' said historian Juergen Kocka. ``We should take care of
the east, but not so that it disassociates us from the West.''

   An urban golfer's paradise is being planned for
a tree-lined spot in the East River under the shadow of a
psychiatric center, a sewage-treatment plant and the Fire
Department's training academy.
   It is a first for Manhattan. Sort of. The new course is to be on
Randalls Island, which sits in the East River but is considered
part of the borough of Manhattan.
   Golf came to the city in 1895, when the nation's first public
course was opened at Van Cortlandt Park. But that's across the
river and in the Bronx.
   The links plan approved by the Parks and Recreation Department
last week calls for a driving range, pro shop and 36 holes of
miniature golf on 17 acres of Randalls Island.
   The American Golf Corporation got the go ahead for the project,
which the company says will cost $2.7 million.
   The city expects to make up to $500,000 a year in revenues.
   ``The area is underused now, and the golf center will be a
terrific addition to the city park system,'' said Parks
Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum, who dismissed concerns that the complex
will take space away from ball fields and playgrounds.
   ``We aren't going to cut down any trees and we aren't going to
take away any ball fields for children,'' she said.
   ``What we're doing is simply letting the golfers of Manhattan
have their day.''

   A 730-foot tanker carrying more than 10 million
gallons of oil products ran onto a reef and was aground for nearly
11 hours before tugboats freed it in a rising tide today,
authorities said. There was no immediate sign of a spill.
   A pump room of the single-hull Star Connecticut took on 15 feet
of water in the accident Tuesday night, but the flooding was
controlled and a Coast Guard helicopter lowered pumps to the ship,
said Lt. Kent Youel, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   The ship ran aground a mile south of Barbers Point, about 10
miles west of Honolulu. The Star Connecticut, owned by Texaco, had
just left an offshore mooring and went aground about a mile away,
Youel said.
   After it was freed this morning, commercial divers checked the
underside of the ship for damage, Youel said. Their findings would
determine where the ship would be taken, he said. The tanker ran
aground shortly after leaving the Orion Independence refinery at
Barbers Point.
   The Coast Guard's main goal was to unload the oil, various types
totaling about 250,000 barrels, from the ship as quickly as
possible, Youel said.
   The grounding is near where another tanker, the Exxon Houston,
broke free from its offshore mooring in 1989, ran aground and
spilled 33,000 gallons of oil that fouled the shore.
   Aboard the Star Connecticut were low sulphur oil, high sulphur
oil, light naphtha oil and black oil, Youel said.

   Search teams and relief aid were
dispatched to remote sections of southern Iran on Wednesday
following a powerfu earthquake that killed at least 22 villagers
and left more than 12,000 homeless, Tehran radio reported.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said most of the victims were
children less than 12 years old who were sleeping when the quake
struck Tuesday evening. The radio said 100 people were seriously
injured.
   The crisis further strains Iran's relief agencies, still reeling
from a major quake in northern Iran in June which killed an
estimated 50,000 people.
   The temblor shook 18 villages around the city of Darab, about
600 miles southeast of Tehran, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency said.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said initial readings put the
magnitude of the quake at 7.0 on the Richter scale. Iran's
Geophysics Center of Tehran University said it measured 6.6.
   The news agency's casualty toll was slightly lower than the
radio report, suggesting the count was ongoing.
   It said two of the villages, Qareh-No and Do-Borj-E Fourk, were
razed. They had a combined population of more than 6,300 people.
   Tehran television said the other villages sustained 60 percent
to 90 percent damage, and that seven villages were without potable
water.
   The radio reported that schools, communication centers and
police offices were flattened. Roads to the villages were blocked.
   Rescuers worked round-the-clock searching for survivors, while
helicopters flew in blankets and tents and carried those injured to
hospitals, IRNA said.
   Earthquakes of 6 on the Richter scale can cause widespread,
heavy damage. A earthquake of 7 is considered major.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. For example, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake
10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   A quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck northern Iran
on June 21, killing an estimated 50,000 people and leaving 500,000
homeless.
   IRNA said the region hit by Tuesday's quake was rocked with
aftershocks, the strongest of which measured 5.6 and came almost an
hour after the main quake.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani sent Vice President Hamid Mirzadeh
to the region after allocating $13 million for disaster relief.
   Rafsanjani, who visited the northern Gilan and Zanjan provinces,
said only half of the homeless from the June quake have found
permanent shelter. He urged officials to speed up reconstruction
before temperatures plung below freezing in the coming weeks.
   Earlier this week he ordered all his ministers to visit the
stricken areas in the north to help speed up reconstruction.

   Voters may be enraged at wasteful government, high taxes and a
fouled environment, but ballot contests decided in 26 states showed
they're not about to rock the economic boat to solve those
problems.
   Environmentalists had hoped to buoy their cause with ``Big
Green,'' a sweeping California proposal that would have imposed a
wide and unprecedented array of restrictions on offshore drilling,
pesticide use and air pollutants.
   Instead, ``Big Green'' was done in Tuesday by big bucks: a $10
milliion campaign against it by various industries that apparently
convinced Californians that the potential cost of the measure would
be a crushing new burden in a sagging economy.
   The measure was trounced by nearly a 2-1 margin. And except for
Pacific Grove, Calif., where voters approved a $1.2 million bond to
protect a butterfly preserve, environment-related ballot issues
took beatings practically everywhere else: in New York, Oregon,
Missouri and Washington.
   Meanwhile, residents of Massachusetts and six other states
rejected stringent anti-taxing, anti-spending measures, apparently
heeding warnings from educators and local officials that the
resulting school and municipal cuts might be even worse than the
disease of government waste.
   Oregon, however, passed a tough anti-tax measure.
   Voters narrowly approved Measure 5, which will phase in a 1.5
percent ceiling on the property tax rate by 1995. It will cause
property taxes to drop an estimated 45 percent by 1995, and require
the Legislature to replace whatever money would be lost to schools
from the property tax cuts.
   In all, Americans decided 236 statewide ballot questions Tuesday
and scores of local contests.
   Arizonans may have lost their shot at being host to the Super
Bowl in 1993 after rejecting a proposal to make Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday a state holiday.
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue recommended
Wednesday that the game be played elsewhere after Arizonans decided
to remain one of just three states without a formal holiday
honoring the slain civil rights leader.
   Alaskans recriminalized private use of marijuana for the first
time in 15 years, while Maine voters abolished tough blue laws
forcing big stores to shut on Sundays. Florida voters decided to
become the first state to make a three-day wait on gun purchases
part of their constitution.
   Washington, D.C., voters turned back an attempt to restore the
right of homeless people to city-financed overnight shelter.
   Santa Clara County, Calif., rejected a stadium bond intended to
lure the baseball Giants from San Francisco, while San Franciscans
approved a measure allowing unmarried couples to register their
relationships with city officials but without conferring formal new
benefits. Seattle voters retained spousal benefits for unmarried
companions of municipal employees.
   Disgruntled Staten Island residents, long in the shadows of
other New York City boroughs, decided to study possible secession
from the Big Apple.
   Among other significant ballot measures:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -In New York, a $1.97 billion environmental bond lost narrowly
despite the strong backing of Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   -Voters in Washington rejected a proposal mandating land-use
plannin throughout the state.
   -Oregonians voted down strict recycling rules as well as a
proposal that would have shut down the Trojan nuclear plant, the
state's only nuclear power plant.
   -Missouri voters rejected a ``Natural Streams'' initiative to
regulate development along scenic waterways in the Ozarks.
   -South Dakotans turned down limits on mining in the Black Hills,
but approved regulating large-scale garbage dumps.
   -Besides ``Big Green,'' Californians rejected the ``Forests
Forever'' plan, which would have limited widespread logging.
   -But Arizonans and Minnesotans approved dedicating portions of
state lottery proceeds to preserving the environment.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXING, SPENDING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Massachusetts residents disapproved a $2.6 billion tax rollback
to 1988 levels. It would have been the nation's largest
voter-initiated state tax cut.
   -Californians narrowly defeated Initiative 136, dubbed ``Son of
Jarvis.'' The measure - named for the co-author of Proposition 13,
which started the nationwide tax revolt 12 years ago - would have
required a two-thirds legislative or popular majority for new
taxes.
   Californians also rejected two measures that would have
increased the state tax on alcohol.
   -Montanans turned down a measure that would have replaced their
state income, property and sales taxes in favor of a ``transaction
charge'' of 1 percent on all financial dealings.
   But they also rejected a measure boosting the state cigarette
tax 140 percent to 43 cents a pack, which would have been the
nation's highest.
   -Utah voters refused to abolish the state sales tax on food.
   -Nebraskans voted against a 2 percent limit on annual state and
local budget increases.
   -Coloradans rejected a measure requiring voter approval for any
state or local tax increase.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TERM LIMITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Californians voted to limit the number of terms state
politicians can serve to a total of six years - three terms - for
Assembly members and eight years - two terms - for state senators.
The eight-year limit also applies to statewide officers.
   The measure also eliminated the legislature's pension program
and cut its operating budget about 40 percent.
   They defeated another measure, backed by consumer advocate Ralph
Nader and Common Cause, to limit statewide officers to eight
consecutive years and allow legislators only 12 consecutive years
in each house.
   -71 percent of Coloradans voted for a limit of eight consecutive
years for holding a single state office.
   -Kansas City, Mo., residents limited city council members and
the mayor to two consecutive four-year terms. Council members can
run again after sitting out a term.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -In a race considered critical by the nation's education
establishment, Oregon defeated a plan to give up to $2,500 tax
credits to allow parents to send their children to any public or
private school they wish, or to teach them at home.
   -Arizona residents turned down a proposal to increase spending
on education by about $6 billion over 10 years.
   -Kansans defeated a plan shifting much of the governing
authority of existing state education boards to the legislature.
   -A Nebraska voted narrowly not to repeal a recently enacted
school finance reform package that featured higher sales and income
taxes in order to shift reliance away from property taxes.

   A congressman who switched to the
Republican party last year, thinking his southern Democratic
supporters would defect too, found out he was wrong.
   Rep. Bill Grant lost his bid for re-election Tuesday when
Democrat Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson defeated him in the race for
Florida's 2nd District.
   Complete unofficial results showed Peterson had 101,615 votes,
or 57 percent, to Grant's 76,518 votes, or 43 percent.
   Grant was seeking a third term.
   Eight of 10 voters in the district are registered Democrats, and
both parties sakey to whether ow the race as a ther southern
Democrats would be willing to defect to the GOP.
   Congress' inability to pass a budget and reduce the deficit
during much of October contributed to Grant's defeat, Peterson
said.
   ``The country came to a stop and Bill Grant was a part of
that,'' Peterson said. ``The party switch was a factor, but mainly
it was the way he did it.''

<HEAD>Hahn - That's Kenneth P. - Nabs County Assessor Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   County Assessor John Lynch frequently
reminded voters that County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn supported him
for re-election.
   But come Tuesday, Kenneth P. Hahn ousted Lynch from office.
   Confused?
   The county supervisor and Lynch's challenger share the same
first and last nameraft flew over the Station One Hotel before
plunging into the ocean, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Steve Honda. The
plane was not carrying any bombs, Honda said.
   Ron Welch and Greg White were working on a car in front of
White's apartment when the A-6 roared overhead. ``It was flaming
fully,'' said White.
   Lorraine Fortier, 24, was at the Station One Hotel.
   ``I was in my room when I heard this loud sound,'' said Ms.
Fortier. ``I've been here a couple weeks so I was used to the noise
the jets make taking off over the hotel and I knew this was not
right.''
   Ms. Fortier rushed to her balcony in time to see the jet slam
into the ocean.
   ``I saw this big flash of light - this big fireball - hit the
water and that was it.''
   Part of the plane's canopy and an ejection seat fell onto the
beach, Honda said, but no one on the ground was hurt.
   The Navy started an investigation, Honda said.
   The pilot was taken to Virginia Beach General Hospital for
observation and released within an hour, according to t. Terry
Evans, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air Force. The
bombardier-navigator was taken to a clinic at the Oceana base where
he was treated for cuts and released, Evans said.
   He said their names would not be released.

   Civil engineer Jim Allerton of Seattle didn't
vote.
   ``It's just sleazeball A or sleazeball B,'' he said.
   College student Jennifer Toledo didn't vote.
   ``I don't believe in Santa Claus. I don't believe in the tooth
fairy. I don't believe in politicians,'' she said.
   Food service manager Jim Madzinski didn't vote.
   ``Honestly, I'm not registered,'' he said. ``The last thing I
want to do is get pulled in for jury duty.''
   These Americans were among the estimated 110 million adults who
sat out Tuesday's election. They far outnumbered the 76 million who
voted.
   Were they sending a message?
   The experts aren't sure. Some see anger in the low turnout;
others just see indifference.
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, who provided the turnout estimates, said voter
turnout rose ``in places where there was something important to
decide.''
   In places where the public saw only messages framed by political
consultants and sensed that nothing real was at stake, turnout was
down, he said.
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, read
it somewhat differently.
   It's not that non-voters are turned off, Buchanan said, but that
they are untouched by government.
   ``Most people in America come close to regarding politics as
very distant from their lives,'' he said. ``It's just not an urgent
matter.''
   People are more likely to tune in when a president is being
elected, Buchanan said. Turnout always rises in presidential years.
   But Buchanan says it is wrong to assume that non-voters share
similar reasons for their failure to vote.
   Some are kept away by barriers such as registration requirements
and poll closing hours, he said.
   Some feel impotent, frustrated, certain their vote can't make a
difference.
   And some, especially young adults, 18-24, feel politics simply
has no relevance to their lives.
   ABC News polled 1,028 likely non-voters. It said the non-voters
expressed the same concerns about the course of the country and the
prospect of war as those who vote.
   Six in 10 said it is not true that all politicians are alike;
they said that it does matter who is elected.
   Among the non-voters who were registered, 30 percent said time
constraints would keep them from voting; another 22 percent cited
health.
   Whatever the reasons - some people think the United States
simply conducts too many elections for too many offices - turnout
is lower in this country than in any democracy in the world.
   This year, Gans calculates, the figure will be about 36.3
percent, the same as four years ago.
   Across America on Election Day, talking to Associated Press
reporters, non-voters tried to give their reasons. Most had a
``they're-all-bums '' quality.
   ``Why bother?'' asked Skyp Krantz, 43, of Dayton, Ohio, who
earns $9,000 a year as a record store clerk. He said he has never
voted. ``No matter who is voted in, once they are elected, they do
what they want or worse, what somebody with a lot of money wants.''
   In Albuquerque, N.M., appliance salesman Robin Smedley, 36,
abdicated purposely. ``I can voice my opinion by having no opinion
at all,'' he said.
   Kim Cruea, 26, a nanny who cares for four children in
Indianapolis, wasn't registered. But even if she were, she said,
``with all these horrible campaign commercials, I wouldn't know who
to vote for. They make everyone sound so horrible.''
   In Madison, Wis., college student Kevin Moore, 25, seemed to
confirm Buchanan's theory about the unaffected young. ``I'm just
not interested,'' he said while waiting to cross a street on his
bicycle. ``I don't think anyone running for office can do anything
for me.''
   In Traverse City, Mich., sewing store manager Beverly Kozacek
ticked off her reasons on her fingers.
   ``I did not vote because of the way the campaigns were run,''
she said, bending an index finger. ``I did not vote because I did
not like any of the candidates running ...''
   ``You know I could have voted,'' she said. ``I drove right by
the polling place and said, `I will not turn in.' There was just so
much negative everything this year.''

   Strolling arm-in-arm and carrying red carnations
in a Revolution Day parade, retired schoolteachers Lina Solomanaya
and Olga Stoyanovskaya appeared to be in a holiday mood. They
weren't.
   ``All my life I've been deceived,'' Mrs. Solomanaya said. ``I
was a Communist and I believed what they told me. I raised my
children that way, too. I sent them to the Pioneers and the
Communist Youth League.
   ``We have begun to open our eyes only in the last few years. We
know what happened in 1917, and we can see what it has brought us.
We just can't pretend anymore that it was right.''
   The Nov. 7 holiday traditionally has glorified the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution with a military parade through Red Square.
   But on Wednesday, in addition to the Red Square parade, tens of
thousands of Soviets marched through Moscow and other cities in
counter-demonstrations expressing anger and disillusionment.
   Increasingly, Soviet historians and politicians are publicly
declaring the revolution a failure. Some call it a noble, but
unsuccessful, experiment. Others call a criminal coup that blocked
the country's evolution toward parliamentary democracy.
   Mrs. Solomanaya, 61, and Mrs. Stoyanovskaya, 55, marched with
more than 5,000 people behind banners with slogans such as ``Nov.
7: A Day of Mourning for Russia.''
   The rally began a few blocks from Red Square, outside the
Communist Party headquarters, where radical politician Lev Shemayev
told the crowd: ``We no longer want to be guinea pigs in the giant
experiment forced on us by false Bolsheviks for the past 73
years.''
   It ended about one mile away at the apartment building where
dissident physicist and 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei
Sakharov lived before his death last December.
   Along the way, Mrs. Solomanaya and Mrs. Stoyanovskaya explained
why they have lost faith both in revolutionary ideology and
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``For 73 years, we thought we were moving to a brighter future -
and we never got there,'' said Mrs. Solomanaya, who taught
literature in a Moscow high school.
   ``They promised us free medical care, free educations, good
pensions. But all we got was crumbs,'' added Mrs. Stoyanovskaya.
   Passing a row of embassies, the two friends said Western
countries have a higher standard of living, more freedom and less
fear. They complained that sugar is rationed in Moscow, butter and
eggs have disappeared from state stores, and shopping is
humiliating.
   Mrs. Solomanaya said long lines have put the Soviet people in an
``evil'' mood.
   ``We are irritable, annoyed, vexed, because every step in our
lives has become difficult,'' said Mrs. Stoyanovskaya, a former
English teacher.
   Both women said Gorbachev failed to revive the economy.
   ``Gorbachev brought us free speech, which was something we never
expected, and we have to thank him for that,'' Mrs. Stoyanovskaya
said.
   ``But Gorbachev is like a weather vane, turning whichever way
the wind blows. First he supported the 500-day (economic reform)
program. Then he rejected it. He is pressured by the right, and he
gives in.''
   Mrs. Solomanaya said she is now pinning her hopes on reformers
in the Russian republic government, led by President Boris Yeltsin,
because they are willing to take more resolute steps toward
economic reform.
   But she said she expects conditions to worsen before getting
better.
   ``We are tired of socialism, communism, internationalism,'' she
said. ``All we want is a better life - not another `ism.'''

<HEAD>Voters in ``Butterfly Town USA'' Decide To Save Monarch Habitat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The migratory haven of thousands of
majestic monarch butterflies has been saved at the ballot box as
voters here approved bonds to purchase a habitat for the insects.
   Measure G, a $1.2 million bond issue, required two-thirds vote
to pass. Sixty-nine percent of voters favored the measure, and 31
percent voted against it.
   Developers and property rights groups opposed the revenue bond
issue to purchase and set aside a 2.7-acre habitat in this
community known as ``Butterfly Town USA.''
   But lovers of the graceful insect argued that protecting
privately owned Diveley Grove would help save the butterfly
population that winters in the grove and protect the town's love
affair with the orange and black butterfly.
   ``I just can't image Butterfly Town USA without butterflies,''
said Ro Vaccaro, member of the Friends of the Monarch.
   The grove of Monterey pine and eucalyptus trees is one of the
few remaining monarch wintering grounds in the western United
States.
   On the second Saturday of each October, school children dress as
butterflies and march through this seaside Monterey Peninsula town
of 16,000, spreading colorful wings to usher in the fall butterfly
season.
   The issue will raise the property tax rate by 1.5 cents per $100
of assessed valuation - about $15 a year on a $100,000 home.

   The Justice Department today announced a
70-count indictment against a Georgia man for the mail-bomb
killings of a federal appellate judge and a Savannah civil rights
lawyer.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and FBI Director William
Sessions announced the indictment, which was returned in Atlanta
against Walter L. Moody Jr.
   Moody, 56, is charged with mailing package bombs last December
that killed Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah, Ga., city
alderman and civil rights lawyer Robert E. Robinson.
   Both Vance and Robinson suffered fatal injuries by the force of
the blasts when they opened packages mailed to them less than a
week before Christmas.
   Moody, of Rex, Ga., is charged with murder of a U.S. judge,
which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. He also is
charged with sending package bombs to the court where Vance sat,
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and the Jacksonville,
Fla., office of the NAACP.
   Other charges alleged that Moody, who is in custody on another
federal case, mailed assassination threats to all of Vance's
colleagues on the 11th circuit.
   Six of the charges against Moody carry sentences of up to life
imprisonment, including allegations he mailed package bombs with
the intent to kill. The bombs found in the Atlanta courthouse and
the Jacksonville NAACP office were removed without causing any
injuries.
   Thornburgh said the bombings ``strike at the heart of our
American concept of the rule of law.''
   ``Those who would seek to attack the integrity and sanctity of
our legal system through violent behavior would undermine the very
foundations of our democracy,'' he said.
   Vance died after opening a package that was mailed to his home
in Mountain Brook, Ala.
   Moody and his wife, Susan, previously were accused of conspiracy
and obstruction of jusice in an alleged scheme to induce a federal
court in Macon, Ga., to vacate Moody's 1972 conviction for unlawful
possession of a pipe bomb.
   Moody was convicted of the explosives charge after a pipe bomb
went off in his home, injuring his then-wife, Hazel. He served two
years in federal prison for the conviction. Moody and his wife were
accused in July of persuading witnesses to sign false affidavits
and give false testimony.
   During the current investigation, there were reports that agents
seized 17 25-cent stamps showing the American flag over Yosemite
National Park from the purse of Susan Moody. All four mail bombs
bore the Yosemite commemorative stamps.
   Several news organizations received the letters from a group
calling itself Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System,
which threatened to kill lawyers, judges and NAACP officials.
   Investigators said the letters bore similar markings and were
sent from locations in Georgia.
   In the letters, the group claimed it ``assassinated Judge Robert
S. Vance and attorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocities''
to a white women who was robbed, raped and murdered in Atlanta in
1988.
   The letters also expressed anger over a school desegregation
case in DeKalb County, Ga., in which Vance participated as a judge.
The appellate panel ordered the school system to transfer white
teachers to schools with predominantly black student populations.

<HEAD>Ballot-Box Surprises Befuddle The Experts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of key races this year demonstrated
once again that polling may be more art than science.
   While most pr-election surveys were reliable, voters provided
enough ballot-box surprises to befuddle the experts.
   New Jersey's popular Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley got a scare
from a political unknown who took 49 percent of the vote.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, the combative conservative Republican from
North Carolina, burst the bubble of liberal Democrats - and exulted
over his 6-point margin of victory.
   And in Michigan, Republican John Engler pulled off a stunning
upset that blindsided even his own pollsters.
   Was Engler's razor-thin defeat of two-term Democratic Gov. James
J. Blanchard a surprise?
   ``Without a doubt,'' said John Wilson of American Viewpoint, who
did Engler's polling.
   Two weeks before the election, American Viewpoint said 53
percent of the voters were backing Blanchard, 33 percent Engler and
14 percent undecided.
   Wilson attributed the dramatic shift to complacency by Blanchard
and the challenger's tenacity and good organization in getting out
the vote on Tuesday.
   Engler is ``just not the kind of guy that loses,'' said Wilson.
``It was against all the odds.''
   Pollsters rarely admit to mistakes. There are as many
explanations as races when the pulse-takers are confounded.
   The Bradley contest is a good example.
   The former Rhodes Scholar and professional basketball star was
considered untouchable in New Jersey and a good bet for a
presidential bid somewhere down the road.
   Ironically, some believe his own popularity may have cost him
support.
   ``He's an incredibly popular candidate,'' said Janice Ballou,
polling director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers
University in New Jersey. ``Some people voted against Bradley to
send a message even though they liked him'' because they were
confident he would survive, she said.
   To Wednesday morning quarterbacks, the message was clear: no
taxes.
   Bradley was burned by a decidedly unpopular tax program pushed
by Democratic Gov. Jim Florio, who was not on the ballot.
   Two weeks before the election, the Eagleton Institute said
Bradley's lead over Republican Christine Todd Whitman was 62
percent to 26 percent with 12 percent undecided.
   But Ms. Ballou said her organization saw the tide shifting -
sort of.
   A week before the election, after Ms. Whitman stepped up her
television ads, she cut the lead almost in half. Bradley was ahead
50 to 33 percent, with 17 percent undecided.
   Then Eagleton, which had not budgeted any more money for the
race, stopped polling.
   ``Maybe retrospectively we should have continued to do it,'' Ms.
Ballou said. ``That's a tough call.''
   The Helms contest, perhaps the most closely watched in the
nation, had its own unique dynamic.
   Helms, who makes many a conservative look moderate, stepped up
his attacks in the closing days on Harvey Gantt by branding his
Democratic challenger a supporter of racial quotas. Gantt was the
first black mayor of Charlotte and made no secret of his
liberalism.
   ``Probably some white voters had second thoughts about voting
for Harvey Gantt. Race certainly played a role in that,'' said Neil
Newhouse of the Republican polling organization the Wirthlin Group.
   On election night, Helms came out 6 percentage points ahead and
gloated over the turnaround from late polls that showed him
trailing by as much as 9 percentage points.
   ``There is no joy in Mudville tonight,'' Helms told gleeful
supporters. ``The mighty ultra-liberal establishment ... and
commentators and columnists have struck out again.''
   Sometimes even candidates rely too much on polls.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said he felt confident staying in
Washington for much of the campaign homestretch because of what his
pollsters were telling him.
   ``We thought frankly that based on what we were seeing ... that
things were going pretty well,'' Gingrich said Wednesday.
   He won by less than a percentage point.

   Patience has become the political bedfellow
of Ben Nelson, who was not ready to claim victory Wednesday after
narrowly defeating Republican Gov. Kay Orr.
   ``Obviously, I'm elated, but I've got to tell you until those
absentee ballots are counted, I'm waiting,'' said Nelson, who had
to wait two months last spring before he was declared the victor by
42 votes in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.
   With all but about 9,500 absentee ballots counted, Nelson had
286,608 votes to Orr's 281,827. A recount would be required by
state law if Nelson's margin of victory dwindled to less than 1
percent of his total votes.
   The absentee ballots will be counted beginning Thursday when all
93 county canvassing boards meet. Secretary of State Allen Beermann
said he expected the absentee ballots to follow the pattern of the
counted votes.
   But Nelson, 49, wasn't taking anything for granted in his first
bid for public office.
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' said Nelson, an insurance
attorney from Omaha.
   Orr, 51, the state's first woman governor and the nation's
firest Republican woman elected governor, refused to concede defeat
in her bid for a second term.
   ``Obviously it doesn't look very optimistic, but we think we owe

   It was like father, like son, for a Udall, a Taft and a Mondale.
But a Chafee, a Chiles and a Mosbacher found a famous last name is
no guarantee of election.
   A bumper crop of political offspring ran on state and local
ballots Tuesday - including two sons of former Democratic vice
presidents in Minnesota, both of them successful. Ted Mondale, son
of Walter Mondale, ousted Republican state Sen. Phyllis McQuaid in
his first bid for office; Hubert H. Humphrey III easily won a third
term as the state's attorney general.
   Here are other younger-generation winners and losers:
   -Republican Robert Taft II was elected secretary of state in
Ohio, ousting Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. He is the
great-grandson of President William Howard Taft and the son and
grandson of U.S. senators.
   -Democrat Tom Udall won a race for attorney general in New
Mexico. His father is former Arizona Rep. and Interior Secretary
Stewart Udall.
   -Two young Kennedys were returned to office: Joseph P. Kennedy
II, son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, won a third term in
Congress from Massachusetts; Patrick J. Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, was unopposed for a second term in the Rhode Island House.
   -George Wallace Jr., son of the former longtime Alabama
governor, coasted unopposed to a second term as the state's
treasurer.
   -While his father, Lawton Chiles, was winning the Florida
governorship, Ed Chiles lost his race for a Florida Senate seat to
Republican John McKay. But the younger Chiles received 48 percent
of the vote in a heavily Republican district on the state's
southwest coast and said: ``I feel like a winner.
   -Lincoln D. Chafee, son of Republican Sen. John H. Chafee, was
defeated by Democrat Charles Donovan in his bid for mayor of
Warwick, R.I.
   -Rob Mosbacher, son of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, fell
short in his race for lieutenant governor of Texas. He was beaten
by Democrat Bob Bullock.
   Two political daughters met with varying results:
   -Democrat Kathleen Brown, whose father is former California Gov.
Pat Brown and brother is former Gov. Jerry Brown, ousted the
state's appointed state treasurer, Republican Thomas Hayes.
   -Republican Mary Mead, whose father, Cliff Hansen, was a former
Wyoming senator and governor, lost to the state's current governor,
Democrat Mike Sullivan.

<HEAD>US to Withdraw All Jet Fighters From Philippines Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All U.S. jet fighters based in the Philippines
will be withdrawn by next September, the Pentagon announced
Wednesday on the eve of a new round of negotiations on the future
of American bases there.
   The 48 aircraft will be removed from Clark Air Base along with
more than 1,800 Air Force personnel, leaving a U.S. military
airlift command unit, training units and special operations forces
at Clark, the Pentagon said. Between 7,500 and 8,000 U.S. Air Force
personnel currently are based at Clark.
   The decision was conveyed to Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul
S. Manglapus by Richard L. Armitage, the presidential special
negotiator on U.S. basing arrangements in the Philippines,
according to a statement issued by the Pentagon.
   In Manila, Manglapus described the planned pullout as a
``partial victory.''
   ``It's their privilege to withdraw,'' Manglapus said. ``It's
certainly a step forward.'' He did not elaborate.
   Armitage arrived in Manila on Wednesday to resume negotiations
with Manglapus Thursday on the future of Clark and five other
American military facilities in the Philippines.
   A leasing agreement on U.S. use of the installations is due to
expire next September; Manila wants the U.S. military phased out by
then, but the Bush administration has proposed a withdrawal period
of 10 or 12 years.
   President Corazon Aquino has set a January deadline for
completing the negotiations.
   The U.S. statement on removal of the 48 fighter aircraft said
the decision was unilateral and not a result of the base
negotiations. It added, however, that ``this decision was
influenced though not dictated by'' Manila's publicly expressed
position that the U.S. aircraft should be withdrawn by next
September.
   Lt. Col. Peg Bowman, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Pentagon,
said the 24 U.S. F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft in the 90th Tactical
Fighter Squadron at Clark will be removed in May 1991, as
previously announced. She said they will be taken out of the active
fleet and kept as potential replacements for other aircraft.
   The 24 F-4E Phantom fighter-bombers in the 3rd Tactical Fighter
Squadron at Clark will be withdrawn by next September. The Air
Force had planned to replace them with F-15E tactical fighters, but
Wednesday's announcement said the F-15Es would instead be based at
Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska.
   During a coup attempt in the Philippines last December, F-4E
Phantoms from Clark flew air cover for loyalist forces, helping
foil the revolt but also heightening political sensitivities over
the presence of U.S. forces in the former U.S. colony.
   U.S. allies are being assured that the move ``in no way
diminishes our commitment or ability to meet our responsibilities
in the Pacific,'' the Pentagon statement said.

<HEAD>Embattled Indian Government First Ousted by Parliament Vote</HEAD>

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's embattled
government Wednesday became the first ever ousted by a Parliament
vote, collapsing under political divisions and controversy over
religious and caste bloodshed.
   Following the vote, Singh convened his defeated Cabinet to
endorse his resignation letter to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
The two are expected to meet Thursday.
   ``We aren't going with our heads down. This is a struggle. We
struggled in government. We will continue outside,'' Singh said.
   The 11-month-old coalition government was shaken by continued
separatist struggles in Kashmir and Punjab states, rising prices
and Singh's program to raise the government job quota for low-caste
Hindus. The policy launched widespread clashes and a wave of
suicides among upper-caste Hindus.
   The government was ultimately crippled last month when a
fundamentalist Hindu group withdrew from the coalition in protest
over a mosque dispute, which has left more than 365 people dead.
   The 11-hour debate ended with a 346-142 vote against the
government, with eight abstentions. The vote was greeted with
cheers and the thumping of desks.
   It was the first time an Indian government was ousted by a vote
of Parliament since independence in 1947.
   ``The Lok Sabht ``unleashed every illicit force ... every raw
nerve was exposed,'' Gandhi said. ``This government has reduced the
credibility of this nation in the eyes of the world.''
   India's rules of succession in the event of the government's
fall are vague and leave some discretion to the president. By
custom, Venkataraman should give Gandhi first chance to form a new
government because his Congress party is the largest.
   Gandhi has said he doesn't want the job right now and will
support Chandra Shekhar's breakaway Janata Dal faction. Chandra
Shekhar is known to have 58 supporters from the Janata Dal.
Congress has 195 members in the 522-member Lok Sabha.
   Unrest over Hindu attempts to raze a mosque and build a temple
on the site raged even while lawmakers met to oust Singh's
government.
   Four more people were killed in Uttar Pradesh state and a
17-year-old student burned himself to death in New Delhi to protest
the government's opposition to the temple project in Ayodhya, about
300 miles east of New Delhi. Fundamentalist Hindus claim the
460-year-old mosque stands on the birthplace of the warrior-god
Rama. They want to destroy the mosque and build a temple.
   At least 368 people have died in the dispute since late October
across India, and others have been killed in related unrest in the
neighboring nations of Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
   Singh's government lost its majority in Parliament Oct. 23 when
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew following the arrest
of its leader while on a cross-country march to muster support for
the temple.
   Singh said he does not oppose building a temple, but he wouldn't
allow the Moslem holy place to be overrun. He turned the issue into
a battle to defend secularism against the Hindu radicalism.
   Since Singh's Aug. 7 announcement to guarantee about half of all
civil service jobs to low-caste Hindus, at least 67 students have
committed suicide and 67 have died in street clashes with police.
   About 82 percent of India's 800 million people are Hindus and 12
percent are Moslem.
   In Jammu-Kashmir state, where Moslem separatists seek autonomy,
at least 270 people have died this year. About 600 have been killed
in the northwestern Punjab state in violence linked to a separatist
struggle by Sikh militants.
   Singh likened the new government to a 25-horsepower vehicle
being dragged backwards by a huge trailer. He said Chandra Shekhar
had no mandate from the people to be prime minister, and accused
him of political opportunism.

<HEAD>Top Official Warns of Organized Crime in Former East Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Germany's top police official confirmed the fears
of many ordinary citizens when he said Wednesday that the eastern
half of the new nation could become a breeding ground for organized
crime.
   In recent weeks, German news media have been filled with reports
about crime bands moving into the former East Germany to gain
control of prostitution, gambling and even garbage dumping.
   The fears come at a time of upheaval in the former Communist
nation, marked by skyrocketing unemployment and the virtual
breakdown of the justice system.
   Right-wing extremism is also on the rise, and gangs of rowdy
soccer fans have been clashing outside hotly disputed games. Police
shot to death one soccer fan last weekend in the troubled city of
Leipzig.
   ``The developments in the five new states (of former East
Germany) are causing many of us to be concerned,'' said Hans-Ludwig
Zachert, president of the federal criminal police.
   ``These transitional difficulties form an ideal breeding ground
for organized crime,'' Zachert said during a forum discussion at
the police headquarters in Wiesbaden.
   The federal criminal police, known in German as the
Bundeskriminalamt, are the German equivalent of the FBI.
   Like many other developments in the rapid unification completed
on Oct. 3, violent and white-collar crime have caught many former
East Germans off guard.
   Zachert called for stepping up the crimefighting efforts
``within a very short time.''
   Under the Communist regime, an ever-vigilant secret police
apprehended most people likely to step out of line. The result was
a low crime rate that left women and children free to walk the
streets in complete safety any time of day or night in the country
of 16.6 million.
   All that began to change as the borders fell just a year ago
Friday. West Germans flooded eastward by the tens of thousands,
bringing criminals along with them.
   In fact, caretaker Premier Hans Modrow even said late last year
the Berlin Wall would stay up, in part to keep out lawbreakers and
illegal drugs.
   Complete statistics do not exist, although the few available
numbers start to tell the story.
   In the first nine months of this year, there were 1,400 armed
robberies and serious extortion cases in the former East Germany,
three times as many for the comparable period in 1989.
Seventy-seven of them were bank holdups, a once virtually
unheard-of crime.
   Financial scandals stemming from the July 1 merger of the two
countries' currencies are uncovered weekly.
   ``Mafia Heading East,'' is the way the influential newsmagazine
Der Spiegel headlined its comprehensive report on the organized
crime two months ago.
   Der Spiegel said ``swindlers, fences and con men'' were heading
to East Germany.
   ``Also the big-time crooks from the organized crime gangs have
discovered what is still East Germany as a market,'' Der Spiegel
wrote.
   Zachert said front men were already operating in the former East
Germany. They are trying to gain control over some urban areas in
hope of turning them in to Red Light districts complete with
illegal gambling.
   The former East German regime once profited handsomely by
selling dumping space to garbage companies from Western countries.
The discarded products included toxic wastes.
   Zachert says there are signs that organized crime elements have
been trying to muscle their way into the dumping arrangements to
make huge profits.
   He added that East Germans eager to acquire Western-style wealth
quickly may be drawn to organized crime.

   Six governors found themselves out of a job
Wednesday after elections that gave Democrats a new hold on two
high-growth Sun Belt states, Florida and Texas, while producing
Republican surprises in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The results in the governor's races didn't fully satisfy either
party but produced one clear winner - independents. Former
Republicans running as third-party candidates won in Connecticut
and Alaska.
   Voter anger over taxes and unease over the economy appeared to
be behind some of the incumbents' losses, including the ousters of
Republicans Bob Martinez in Florida, Kay Orr in Nebraska, Mike
Hayden in Kansas and Ed DiPrete in Rhode Island.
   The Democratic incumbents who lost, Rudy Perpich in Minnesota
and James Blanchard in Michigan, both were longtime political
fixtures who were seeking third terms and whose personalities had
become an issue.
   ``This is simply an overpowering moment,'' said John Engler, the
Republican winner in Michigan. A week ago he was far behind in the
public opinion polls.
   Sen. Pete Wilson's victory in California, keeping the state in
Republican hands for a third term, was the GOP's top priority,
party spokesman Charles Black said. Wilson defeated Democrat Dianne
Feinstein and now gets to appoint his own successor in the Senate.
   The victory also means Republicans will have veto power when
California's Democratic-controlled legislature draws new
congressional district lines. California stands to gain seven House
seats as a result of population shifts, and Texas and Florida also
will pick up seats.
   Republicans captured five statehouses that had been in
Democratic control: Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont, Michigan and
Minnesota.
   Massachusetts winner William Weld had campaigned with a call for
cutting state spending, but he appeared to benefit most from
lingering anger at retiring Gov. Michael Dukakis and a series of
mean-spirited remarks from Democratic nominee John Silber. Silber
had called Weld a ``backstabbing son of a bitch'' and an
``orange-headed WASP,'' and displayed startling anger in a network
television talk show interview three days before the election.
   Democrats captured seven governorships from Republican control.
They will replace retiring GOP governors in Texas, New Mexico and
Oklahoma, as well as the incumbents unseated in Florida, Kansas,
Rhode Island and Nebraska.
   One state was still in doubt, and seemed likely to remain that
way for a while.
   Arizona Republican Fife Symington led narrowly over Democrat
Terry Goddard, but he was below the majority required by a new
state law passed in the turmoil of Evan Mecham's impeachment two
years ago.
   Write-ins won enough votes to deny Symington 50 percent of the
vote. The Arizona law calls for a runoff, but no one knew when it
would be held.
   ``Overtime,'' declared Goddard. ``The rules of this game haven't
been written yet.''
   The results produced a net decline of one governorship for the
Democrats, to 28, and a drop of one for the Republicans, to 20, if
Symington prevails.
   The gains were the independents - in Alaska, former governor and
Nixon-era interior secretary Wally Hickel, and in Connecticut,
Lowell Weicker, reborn as an independent after losing his GOP
Senate seat two years ago.
   Numbers and independents aside, Democrats looked like the bigger
winners.
   Ann Richards' victory in Texas was a stinging embarrassment for
President Bush, who claims Texas as his home and spent the last
three days there stumping for Republican Clayton Williams.
   ``Bush doesn't make any difference,'' said Mark Gearan, director
of the Democratic Governors' Association. ``He doesn't have any
coattails and in some cases he burdened the candidates.''
   The overriding issue in Texas appeared to be Williams himself,
and the gaffes he committed in squandering a once-overwhelming lead
in the pre-election polls. The last straw may have come last week
when the millionaire oilman offhandedly admitted he paid no income
taxes in 1986.
   Williams acknowledged that his damage was mostly self-inflicted.
   ``Maybe I'm a little too open, maybe straightforward,'' Williams
said.
   The loss of Martinez to former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles in
Florida was also an embarrassment to Bush, who had made three
campaign visits to the state. The victory gave Democrats the chance
to claim they have halted - at least for now - Florida's clear
trend toward Republicans in recent years.
   ``I think all Republicans are breathing a huge sigh of relief
because there was so much doom-and-gloom going on,'' said Michele
Davis, director of the Republican Governors' Association.
``Obviously Texas was a heartbreaker, but Michigan takes a little
of that pain away.''
   Gearan said Democratic losses in Ohio and Michigan, and the
party's failure to regain Illinois, were in part due to a weakened
economy and increased burdens on state governments as a result of
10 years of Republican presidents. Democrats, he said, were blamed
for their states' economic troubles.
   ``We took the fall,'' he said.
   One of the most startling outcomes was in Minnesota. The winner,
Republican Arne Carlson, had been a loser in the GOP primary. But
he was placed on the general-election ballot just 10 days before
the election when the GOP nominee, Jon Grunseth, withdrew from the
race amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
   In victory, Carlson compared himself to Lazarus, the biblical
character who rose from the dead.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said Wednesday he will resign
as chairman of the Solidarity union he has led for a decade if he
loses Poland's presidential election.
   Walesa has also said he will step down if he wins Poland's first
popular presidential election on Nov. 25. His main opponent is his
former adviser, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Walesa told Solidarity's National Commission, meeting at its
Gdansk headquarters, that the union will have to battle the new
government to protect its interests and he does not want to be
accused of seeking revenge.
   ``The union will have to wage a fight and I do not want to lead
this fight so that people will not say that I am taking revenge,''
he said.
   Walesa was an unemployed electrician, fired for his political
activism, when he took charge of a shipyard strike that led to
Solidarity's creation in August 1980. He has been chairman of the
East bloc's first independent trade union ever since.
   Walesa is considered to be the front-runner in the six-way
presidential contest. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two
vote-getters will compete in a Dec. 9 runoff.
   Meanwhile, a government investigation into the former Communist
regime's attempts to thwart Solidarity has uncovered a plot to
kidnap Walesa and raid the Gdansk shipyard during the 1980 strikes.
   The probe also found evidence that the Communist government had
been preparing for martial law as early as fall 1980, more than a
year before the crackdown. In October 1980, a list of activists to
be interned was prepared, including all the leaders of the
then-opposition, investigators said.
   The secret police considered sending ``a police commando group''
to Gdansk to kidnap Walesa and strike committee members on Aug. 27,
1980, and bring them to Warsaw, Interior Ministry spokesman
Wojciech Wroblewski said Tuesday.
   The next step would have been to pacify Gdansk and the other two
Baltic port cities where the nationwide unrest was centered, he
said.
   The plan was dropped, and Walesa signed historic agreements with
Communist authorities four days later, legalizing the East bloc's
first independent trade union on Aug. 31, 1980.
   The report from the Interior Ministry, now under the leadership
of a civilian for the first time in five decades, confirmed long
circulated rumors concerning attempts to suppress Solidarity.
   Since the creation of the Solidarity-led government last year,
the Interior Ministry has been overhauled. The secret police have
been disbanded.

<HEAD>Major Redistricting Gains Bode Well For Future of Democratic Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats' romp for control of
redistricting cements the GOP as the House minority for the
foreseeable future and will allow Democrats to draw local political
lines to their advantage in many states.
   The Democrats gained a handful of new redistricting monopolies
Tuesday, most significantly in Florida and Texas, which will gain
seven of the 19 House seats likely to shift in 1992 to reflect
population shifts of the 1980s.
   Only Republican Pete Wilson's win in the California
gubernatorial race kept a disheartening day for the GOP in the
costly, decade-long redistricting battle from turning to total
disaster.
   ``The greatest area of Democratic victory,'' was Democratic
Party Chairman Ron Brown's assessment of the redistricting fight.
   It's hard to argue with him, although Republicans did.
   ``Our party is very well positioned not only for 1992 but for
the rest of this decade,'' said Charles Black, chief spokesman for
the Republican National Committee.
   Black's assessment was based on the GOP's having a voice in
redistricting for 231 of the 435 congressional districts, roughly
65 more than 10 years ago.
   But given the overwhelming re-election rate of incumbents, the
true battlegrounds are in the states gaining or losing seats, an
area where Democrats clearly will have an edge. And for most of the
1980s Republicans said their chances of becoming the House majority
and making inroads at the state legislative level rested on their
success in redistricting battles this year.
   Overall, Democrats emerged from Tuesday's vote with
redistricting monopolies in 17 states. Republicans control the
process outright in just three, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont,
none of them major redistricting battlegrounds.
   Democrats also have an edge of sorts in many of the states where
power is shared because they control or were likely to control 74
of the nation's 99 legislative chambers, a gain of five chambers.
   Eight states are expected to gain seats after the 1990 Census
and Democrats control the redistricting process outright in five of
those - Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
   By holding the sole pen in those states, Democrats should be
able to protect their House incumbents while drawing 10 new
districts favorable to Democratic candidates.
   California is projected to get seven new seats and Arizona and
Washington one apiece to round out the gainers.
   Wilson will be able to veto any plan drawn by the Democratic
legislature, which would send the fight to the courts. ``The
legislature next year will control the ink; Governor Wilson will
decide whether the ink dries or not,'' said the GOP's Black.
   Still, courts have tended to side with legislatures, so Wilson's
best bet might be to strike a deal with Democrats.
   The Washington remap is done by a bipartisan commission. Control
in Arizona will be split, with the outcome of the undecided
governor's race to decide which party gets two of the three seats
at the table.
   Redistricting power is crucial in the states losing seats - and
therefore House incumbents - too.
   Control is split in all of the big losers - New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. Eleven of the 19
shifting seats will come from these five states, three from New
York and two each from the rest.
   At first glance it appeared Republicans could boast about gains
here by virtue of taking the governor's office in Michigan, Ohio
and Massachusetts from Democratic hands and holding onto the top
job in Illinois.
   But with the exception of Massachusetts, redistricting power was
shared in those states even before Tuesday's vote because of split
control of legislative chambers.
   Two Republicans and one Democrat likely will be squeezed from
New York's House delegation while each party faces the loss of a
seat in Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
   And Massachusetts was likely to pencil out a Democrat anyway
when it loses a seat, unless veteran Republican Rep. Silvio Conte
retires, so the GOP's win in the governor race there, while
significant, likely will not impact congressional redistricting.
   Democrats will decie who loses out when New Jersey, West
Virginia, Kentucky and Louisiana each erase a House seat in two
years. Power over the remapping is shared in the other states
expected to lose a seat, Montana, Iowa and Kansas. Democrats held
none of the three seats at the redistricting table in Kansas on
Monday but on Wednesday had two: the governor's office and the
Kansas House.

<HEAD>Richards Got Help From Democrats, Opponent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Ann Richards once said President
Bush was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' In Clayton
Williams, she found an opponent capable of putting his foot in his
mouth and shooting it too.
   Williams, a millionaire Republican oilman, admitted as much
Wednesday after being beaten by Richards in the Texas governor's
race.
   ``I just would shoot myself in the foot and then I'd load up and
try it again,'' Williams said. ``I hold no blame against anyone.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Richards had
1,909,929 votes, or 51 percent, to Williams' 1,813,405 votes, or 49
percent.
   Williams' campaign, which spent more than $20.4 million, had
everything money could buy and enjoyed a 15-point lead in the polls
with just six weeks to go.
   But he couldn't stop making the gaffes that dated bac to March,
when he likened bad weather to rape and said if it was inevitable,
``just relax and enjoy it.''
   More followed. And in the campaign's final week, he made two
major missteps.
   First, he admitted on a statewide TV broadcast that he didn't
understand the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot
concerned with gubernatorial appointments.
   Then Friday, with the polls opening in only 84 hours, he
acknowledged that he had paid no income taxes in 1986.
   A CBS-TV exit poll said 25 percent of Tuesday's voters made
their choice in those last seven days.
   Williams said he didn't see defeat as rejection of his values
but conceded, ``Maybe I'm a little too open, maybe straightforward.
If there's anything that we've proven, it's that I'm not a
politician.''
   For her part, Richards did many things well.
   First, she raised more money than skeptics had thought she
could. While being outspent nearly 2-to-1, she still raised more
than $11 million, putting her on a par with the 1986 candidates,
Mark White and Bill Clements.
   She mobilized women. The CBS poll showed Richards capturing 61
percent of the women's vote, including 21 percent of Republican
women.
   She found issues that struck a nerve - improving education,
getting control of soaring health insurance rates and her
experience in government.
   And she rallied the Democrats she needed. She carried East and
South Texas, and the CBS poll found her winning 67 percent of the
Hispanic vote and 89 percent of the black vote.
   Down the ballot, Texas voters sent some mixed messages.
   Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, who reportedly may be readying
for a 1996 presidential bid, breezed to re-election with more than
60 percent of the vote over Democratic state Sen. Hugh Parmer of
Fort Worth.
   Democrats again won many of the statewide offices they've held
for more than 100 years, including lieutenant governor, attorney
general and comptroller.
   But the GOP in January will take control of two offices they
haven't held this century - treasurer and agriculture commissioner.

<TEXT>
   Republicans celebrated their first gubernatorial
victory in 20 years Wednesday as the election of William Weld, a
mild-mannered former federal prosecutor, helped Massachusetts take
on the long-lost look of a two-party state.
   ``There was the notion that Republicans just couldn't get it
together,'' said George Bachrach, a former Democratic state
senator. ``That notion has been blown out the window.''
   The political tremor was felt not only in Weld's narrow victory
over Democrat John Silber in the governor's race, but also in a
dramatic power shift in the state Senate.
   The GOP entered this week's election holding just nine seats in
the 40-member body, but unofficial returns Wednesday boosted that
number to at least 14, enough to sustain a veto and give Weld some
leverage against the Democrats.
   Republicans also gave Democratic officeholders some surprising
scares, such as the congressional races in which Reps. Chester
Atkins and Gerry Studds both narrowly survived before joining the
other nine House incumbents from Massachusetts who were re-elected.
   The campaign took such a toll on Atkins that he announced
afterward he planned to step down as state Democratic chairman.
   ``There is only so much punishment any one individual can
endure,'' he said.
   Republicans had high expectations this year. Democratic Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis was not seeking re-election, with his popularity
and the state government both in a shambles after he lost the 1988
presidential race.
   Both Weld and Silber, on leave as Boston University president,
offered voters sharp alternatives to the Dukakis administration.
   Their contest drew a record number of voters for a
non-presidential election. According to unofficial returns with 97
percent of the precincts reporting, approximately 2.27 million
voters cast ballots for governor, marking about a 70 percent
turnout.
   Weld received 1,140,403 votes, or 50 percent; Silber received
1,067,103 votes, or 47 percent. Independent High Tech candidate Len
Umina picked up 64,048 votes, or 3 percent.
   ``I think there was a very anti-Democratic spirit running in
this state,'' Silber said.
   A Republican, Joseph Malone, will be watching over the purse
strings as state treasurer, filling a spot that Democrat Robert Q.
Crane filled for 26 years before his retirement this year.
   ``There was a very clear mood among the public for a change,''
said Senate Minority Leader David Locke. ``People are absolutely
fed up with what's going on. They began to recognize the product of
overwhelming one-party control.''
   In ballot issues, Massachusetts voters rejected by a 3-2 margin
a $1.2 billion tax rollback that critics said would plunge the
feeble state economy into ruins.
   And in Boston, activists trying to carve out a separate,
predominantly black city failed again at the ballot box. The
proposal has lost twice before, and this time supporters failed in
a non-binding referendum that would have requested a feasibility
study of the plan.

<TEXT>
   The powerful leader of a black sect was arrested
Wednesday and charged with directing the slayings of 14 people,
including ``white devils'' who were slain in initiation rites and
whose ears were cut off.
   A federal grand jury here indicted Yahweh ben Yahweh - ``God,
son of God'' in Hebrew - and 16 followers of his secretive
Miami-based Yahweh cult for allegedly using murder, fire bombings
and extortion to build a business empire and keep followerng a hearing
Friday. Yahweh, who faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted on
all charges, was expected to waive removal proceedings from
Louisiana, said Rubin.
   Four of the 17 defendants were still being sought, according to
the FBI.
   The Yahwehs consider themselves the true chosen people, and
Yahweh ben Yahweh is their self-appointed leader, who in the past
has referred to all whites as devils.
   But recently the Yahwehs, who have claimed about 10,000 members,
have diminished their anti-white beliefs, and have won a reputation
as hard workers who built a modest empire of 27 small inner-city
businesses and properties. The Yahweh properties' tax value is
almost $3 million, but the market value is believed to be more.
   Their enterprising spirit, strict religious practices, promotion
of family values and strong opposition to drugs has won them
support in many areas of the black community. Mayor Xavier Suarez
recently attended a ribbon-cutting at a new Yahweh store with
Yahweh ben Yahweh, who has also received civic honors for
rebuilding the inner city.
   But the indictment says the businesses were built in part by the
threat of violence, and by extortion of contributions from
reluctant black neighborhoods. The charges include fire bombing
homes after people opposed fund-raising efforts.
   The sect first became widely known in 1986 when it took over a
drug-infested Opa-locka apartment complex, violently evicting the
residents and promising to make it into a crack-free haven. Two
residents who resisted were shot to death, and Yahweh member Robert
Rozier, a former St. Louis Cardinals defense end, was convicted in
the slayings.
   Rozier - who could have faced the electric chair - also
confessed to two other killings, and Rubin said he agreed to
provide much of the evidence against Yahweh in exchange for a
22-year sentence.
   Most of the victims were Yawheh members who left or opposed
their leader, according to the indictment. Some were shot, others
decapitated and some were beaten to death, according to the
charges.
   But seven white men were killed by those applying to join the
``Brotherhood.'' Entering the secret group within the sect required
a ritual killing, sometimes of a ``white devil.''
   Yahweh ordered the ears cut off of some victims as proof they
were killed, according to Lehtinen.
   The three-count federal indictment naming Yahweh and his
followers accused them of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and
extortion charges for crimes committed in Dade and Palm Beach
counties from 1981 to 1987.

<HEAD>Democrats See Sun Belt Breakthrough: GOP Says It Wasn't `Too Bad'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats boasted Wednesday of a Sun Belt election breakthrough
that could buoy their presidential prospects in 1992. Republicans
gained two late upsets to go with a win in California and claimed,
``we didn't do too bad'' despite mid-term setbacks.
   Still, a Democratic celebration was in full swing.
   ``George Bush is in a slide. There's absolutely no question
about it,'' said Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.
   The White House saw it differently, as a midterm election with
something for everyone, and said it could not be interpreted as a
referendum on Bush's popularity anyway.
   For winners everywhere, the day after brought exultation. ``An
overpowering moment,'' said John Engler, elected governor of
Michigan in a long, late count over Democratic incumbent James
Blanchard.
   From the disappointed, there were generally gracious comments.
Said Democratic Rep. Jim Bates, trailing narrowly in California,
``If the voters decide to make a change, that's what democracy is
all about.''
   After weeks of talk that voters were angry about Congress'
performance and ready to make changes, about 96 percent of
incumbents won re-election.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell and House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, their majorities strengthened in the 102nd
Congress, went to work on an agenda for the next two years. Brown
predicted it would center on economic themes.
   ``The debate over the budget was the best thing that happened,''
he said of the October political free-for-all in which Bush
abandoned his no-new-taxes campaign pledge.
   In the ensuing scramble, Democrats jumped on a theme of ``tax
fairness,'' depicting themselves as defenders of the middle class
and Republicans as protectors of the rich.
   A day after the polls closed, there were four races unsettled.
   Arizona's gubernatorial contest appeared headed for a runoff
after neither Democrat Terry Goddard nor Republican Fife Symington
amassed 50 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
   Three California House races were too close to call, two of them
involving Democratic incumbents.
   In all, Democrats emerged from the elections with a 56-44
majority in the Senate, a gain of one seat. They were adding nine
seats to their House majority for a likely edge of 268-167. Their
major congressional disappointment: GOP Sen. Jesse Helms'
bigger-than-expected re-election in North Carolina.
   Democrats took seven governorships away from Republicans,
including Bush's home state of Texas, where Ann Richards vanquished
Clayton Williams, and Florida, where Lawton Chiles ousted Gov. Bob
Martinez.
   Pete Wilson defeated Dianne Feinstein to keep California in
Republican hands. And the GOP took away five statehouses from the
Democrats, including Ohio and Michael Dukakis' Massachusetts.
Engler's win was an upset, and Arne Carlson won Minnesota in a race
so close it wasn't called until well after dawn.
   With independents Lowell Weicker and Wally Hickel winning in
Connecticut and Alaska, Democrats held 28 governorships for sure
and the Republicans 19. If the GOP wins Arizona, where its
candidate was leading narrowly but heading for the runoff, that
would mean a loss of one for each party.
   Both sides claimed gains in the race to control the
redistricting of House seats before 1992. Democrats emerged with
complete control over reapportionment in Texas and Florida, which
together will gain seven seats, and in 15 other states. Republicans
have outright control in three states, and Wilson's victory gave
then a share of the power with the Democratic legislature in
California, which gains seven seats.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony noted House Democratic gains of two seats in
the South and declared an end to the gradual move toward the GOP
there. ``Realignment is dead,'' he said. ``The Republicans will
have to find a new slogan.''
   ``You win some and you lose some,'' shrugged Bush spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, and he and party spokesman Charles Black said
Republicans beat the historical averages for midterm losses by the
party in the White House.
   Bush ``campaigned hard in Texas and lost, campaigned hard in
California and won,'' Fitzwater added, speaking of two key
gubernatorial races.
   But Brown chortled that Bush ``campaigned heavily for 18
candidates and 14 of them lost.'' Asked why the Democrats lost
California, he replied, ``George Bush didn't stay long enough.''
   Outgoing Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste tried to blame Democratic
gubernatorial losses in New England and the industrial Midwest on
Republican economic policies. ``Democrats may be paying a price for
the weakening of the national economy,'' he said. ``It would be
ironic if those Democrats who have been carrying the burden of
Republican parties for the last decade'' would pay the price for a
recession.
   Fitzwater said Bush was looking forward to working with the new,
Democratic majorities in Congress, but also predicted the election
results would not affect the president's ability to sustain any
vetoes.
   ``It means the veto will continue to be a legislative strategy
tool. The president's been very successful in that regard,
upholding some 16 vetoes in his first two years,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alaska Voters Approve Measure to Recriminalize Marijuana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaskans have voted to again make private
possession of marijuana a crime, striking dwn the nation's most
liberal pot law.
   Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure.
   For 15 years, Alaska law has permitted adults to possess less
than 4 ounces of the drug in their homes and other private places.
   Ballot Measure 2 will make possession of small amounts of
marijuana a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a
$1,000 fine. The new law takes effect in late February.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Marie Majewske, the Anchorage
grandmother who led the initiative campaign. ``I have great faith
in the people of this state. I truly believed they would do the
right thing.
   ``I think that this will say to people that the law didn't work,
and we need to be looking in the other direction, toward a
drug-free environment for our children. The only way to do that is
to tell them it's illegal.''
   The race was closer than most observers expected. Polls had
shown the measure supported by a nearly 2-to-1 margin as late as a
week ago.
   ``It certainly doesn't look like a mandate, does it?'' said
Glenda Straube, campaign manager for Alaskans for Privacy, which
led opposition to the measure.
   Straube said the measure will be challenged in court based on
the strong privacy clause in the Alaska Constitution.
   ``We've had people around the state call and volunteer to be
arrested'' for a test case, she said.

   Three years ago, the Schnick family
awoke to a shooting spree that killed seven of them and put one on
death row. Tuesday, the family learned five members from three
generations were killed by a truck.
   ``When I heard it on the radio this morning, I knew. I just knew
it was them. I knew they were dead,'' said Wilma Ducker, whose
daughter, Sharon Schnick, 45, and three of her daughter's children
were killed in the wreck.
   Mrs. Ducker said Sharon Schnick and her family had spent the
night with her mother-in-law, Alline Schnick, 65.
   Alline Schnick was the driver of the car that apparently ran a
stop sign at a highway intersection about 15 miles north of
Springfield and collided with a tractor-trailer truck.
   Alline Schnick also was killed in the wreck. The other victims
were Sharon Schnick's children, age 9, 5 and 19 months, said Polk
County Coroner Sidney Pitts.
   The only two survivors from the car were Sharon Schnick's
husband, Gary M. Schnick, 42, and their 4-year-old son.
   None of the Schnicks was wearing a seatbelt, Missouri State
Highway Patrol Cpl. Tim Selvey said.
   Gary Schnick underwent surgery at a Springfield hospital and was
listed in critical condition. Their surviving son was listed in
serious condition.
   Gary Schnick's brother, James Schnick, is on Missouri's death
row for an early morning shooting spree in 1987 in which his wife
and two nephews were killed. He was charged but not tried with the
shooting deaths of four other family members in the spree.
   James Schnick was a dairy farmer in Elkland, Mo., about 20 miles
east of Tuesday's accident.
   James Schnick first told authorities that he had killed one of
his nephews in self-defense. He contended the 14-year-old nephew
had killed his own family and then tried to kill him. Police later
found out the nephew died trying to fend off an attack by James
Schnick.

   Voter surveys said economic concerns were evident. Republican
governors Mike Hayden of Kansas, Kay Orr of Nebraska and Martinez
all raised taxes, and all were swept out. New Jersey Democratic
Sen. Bill Bradley's close call seemed to reflect anger with a tax
increase engineered by Democratic Gov. Jim Florio.
   There will be four new faces in the new Senate. The list
includes Republican Reps. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Hank Brown of
Colorado and Larry Craig of Idaho, all of whom succeeded retiring
GOP lawmakers. The fourth is Paul Wellstone, a liberal who defeated
Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota.
   Wilson's election in California will mean a Republican
replacement for his Senate seat.
   Wilson won instant national standing with his victory, while
Richards' victory in Texas and Chiles' in Florida gave Democrats
their biggest wins of the night.
   New Republican governors include: Jim Edgar in Illinois, William
Weld in Massachusetts, Engler in Michigan; Carlson in Minnesota;
George Voinovich in Ohio and Richard Snelling.
   New Democrats include: Chiles, Richards, Zell Miller in Georgia,
Joan Finney in Kansas, Ben Nelson in Nebraska, Bruce King in New
Mexico, David Walters in Oklahoma, Bruce Sundlun in Rhode Island
and Richards in Texas.
   The number of women in the House shrank by one to 28, in part
because several veteran Republicans chose to run for the Senate
instead. They all lost.
   The number of black members of the House rose by one to 25,
including Gary Franks of Connecticut, the first GOP black elected
to the House since 1935.
   The overall re-election rate for House members hovered at 96
percent.
   Not counting the California races that were undecided, the
incumbent House losers totaled 13, four Democrats and nine
Republicans.
   Some were tinged by controversy, including Democratic Rep. Roy
Dyson of Maryland, a hawk on military matters who disclosed he was
a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War, and Arlan Stangeland
of Minnesota, who made sveral hundred long distance telephone calls
to a female lobbyist on his government credit card.
   Republicans won a signal victory in Massachusetts, where they
increased their minority strength in the state senate from nine to
16. That's enough to force a roll call on any vote, if not to sway
the outcome.

   An array of economic concerns aggravated by a
heavy dose of voter exasperation left some political careers in
ruins Wednesday and others on the brink.
   ``Economic concerns are paramount in the minds of people,'' said
Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll. ``The deficit,
savings and loans, increases in taxes, recession, worries about
unemployment - that's what people talk about'' when asked
open-ended questions about their discontent.
   Although abortion did not play a consistent or decisive role in
the elections, it was mentioned much more frequently in exit polls
this year than in 1988 in response to questions about what mattered
most to people.
   Andrew Kohut, president of Princeton Survey Research Associates
Group, attributed the higher frequency to the Supreme Court's 1989
Webster decision giving states more authority to restrict abortion.
   ``It wasn't the dominant issue in every race, but it was in the
top tier in most of the key races,'' Kohut said. ``It's now an
important basis by which people make choices about candidates.''
   In most parts of the country, exit polls - mirroring national
polls - suggested that economic themes were the dominant influence
on voter decision-making.
   The themes took a variety of turns.
   Six incumbent governors were ousted, among them three who were
blamed for higher taxes and two who suffered from the effects of
slumping economies. The same problem almost spelled doom for Maine
Gov. John McKernan.
   And two potential Democratic presidential contenders, Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey and Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, won by less
than the landslides they had anticipated. Anger about higher taxes
was a chief reason.
   Even in Texas, where the strong personalities of the
gubernatorial candidates overshadowed other issues, economics came
into play - particularly after multimillionaire Republican Clayton
Williams said he had paid no taxes in 1986. The information was
perfect fodder for Ann Richards' victorious populist pitch, modeled
on the ``fairness'' theme national Democrats have been trying to
push.
   ``If you're going to look for one issue that seemed to have some
clout in 1990, you'd have to say it was taxes. Voters punished
governors who raised taxes. No doubt about it, taxes continues to
be an issue out there,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of The
Political Report.
   Some analysts said governors were paying for the Reagan
administration's federalist policies.
   ``Reagan transferred the authority and the responsibility and
the fiscal burdens to the states, and the governors were forced to
raise taxes,'' said Larry Sabato, an analyst at the University of
Virginia.
   Given the chance to raise taxes on themselves, voters in four
states said no.
   They did, however, reject drastic tax cuts or government limits
in four out of five states where such measures were on the ballot.
And at least two winning governor candidates - Illinois Republican
Jim Edgar and Florida Democrat Lawton Chiles - carefully avoided a
promise of no new taxes.
   ``If you can convince people that tax money will be well spent,
they will vote for it,'' said Newport. But he added that ``in
general the American public is not in favor at this point of
increased taxes. More and more when we talk about Congress, people
talk about ineptness and inability to get things done. They don't
think it's efficient to send more money to people who are bungling
and not managing it well.''
   Voter restiveness over Congress - an Election Day poll put its
approval rating at 18 percent - translated into only a few surprise
defeats. But victory margins were lower and challengers nearly
overcame apparently safe incumbents in Kentucky, Maine, Georgia and
elsewhere.
   In addition, turnout appeared to be slightly elevated in New
England, the region with the deepest economic problems.
   ``Clearly in New England, where an independent candidate was
elected governor in Connecticut and a socialist was elected in
Vermont, there was a lashing out at politicians,'' said Kohut. ``In
other areas of the country, where things are not quite as bad,
there was less of that.''

   President Bush's struggle to put more
Republicans in Congress was a resounding flop, portending tougher
battles ahead with Democratic lawmakers and tripping warning alarms
for Bush's re-election campaign next year.
   While the president's men tried their best to put a positive
spin on Tuesday's elections, some Republicans grumbled they would
have fared better had Bush stuck by his no-new-tax pledge.
   ``The tax issue was the one thing the Republicans had going for
them and he gave that away and didn't replace it with anything,''
complained Lyn Nofziger, who was White House political director for
Ronald Reagan.
   ``He's got to begin to put his base back together,'' Nofziger
said. ``The base that elected him in 1988 is really kind of
shattered.''
   GOP political consultant John Sears said Bush's flip-flop on
taxes gave Democrats a good campaign issue and emboldened them to
challenge him.
   ``Democrats see there isn't any penalty for attacking the
president,'' Sears said. ``They were fairly docile for the first
year or so.''
   David Mason, a political analyst for the Heritage Foundation,
said, ``It was not bad (for Bush) for an off-year election overall.
The big question was what would have happened if the president had
stuck to his no-new-tax pledge.
   ``If he can't get a more defined message in 1992 than he did
this year, he's going to have a problem,'' Mason added.
   In the most extensive midterm campaign of any president, Bush
made 115 stops for Republicans over the course of a year and helped
raise nearly $90 million. Everywhere, he implored Americans to
chase out the Democrats from Congress and the state capitals and
put the Republicans in charge.
   Voters ignored Bush's plea.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown chortled that Bush
``campaigned heavily for 18 candidates and 14 of them lost.''
   Bush's reversal on taxes and the confusion about his position
during the budget negotiations cost him dearly, raising questions
about his credibility and ability to govern.
   His poll ratings dropped nearly 20 points, then leveled off and
began to inch back up before the elections.
   ``Generally speaking, you don't win points by raising taxes,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged. ``That's
been clear.''
   Nofziger said Bush ``has got some fence-mending to do. He can't
afford to alienate people any further. He's got to go get a hold of
things again.''
   Yet, some analysts say Bush should not be blamed for the losses,
particularly in states like Texas where Republican gubernatorial
candidate Clayton Williams's campaign was plagued by clumsiness and
misstatements.
   ``It would be very hard to blame George Bush for Clayton
Williams' defeat in Texas,'' said Stephen Hess, an analyst at the
Brookings Institution. ``He did that all by himself.
   ``Ultimately, all the candidates lost by themselves yesterday,''
Hess said.
   Democrats strengthened their hold on the House and picked up one
seat in the Senate with the defeat of Republican Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota.
   In the governors' races, Democrats shoved Republicans out of
office in Texas and Florida, two states where Bush had campaigned
hard. Fitzwater called the results ``two sentimental losses.''
   On the other hand, Republicans held on to the governor's office
in California, the biggest prize of the midterm elections, and in
Illinois. They also picked up governorships in Ohio and
Massachusetts. California and Ohio were deemed ``sentimental
victories.''
   ``All in all,'' Fitzwater insisted, ``it looks like a pretty
standard off-year election that has something in it for
everybody.''
   The Democrats emerged with a stronger hand to battle Bush on
vetoes. They are expected to have a 268-167 majority in the next
House and the Senate lineup will favor the Democrats 56-44.
   ``There's no question (but that) he'll have to have a little
more aggressive strategy and he may have to go to a veto
strategy,'' said Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   Richard Viguerie, a hardline conservative leader, said the
elections ``should be a wakeup call for George Bush. He is in
serious trouble. ... The Republican Party under his leadership is
in serious, serious trouble.''
   Ohio's retiring Gov. Richard Celeste, head of the Democratic
Governors Association, said, ``We have an opportunity to do what
was inconceivable six months ago - that is defeat a Republican
president.''
   The Heritage Foundation's Mason said, ``The good news for Bush
is that a couple of his potential opponents didn't come out so
well. (New Jersey Sen. Bill) Bradley is going to look a lot weaker
on the national scene and (New York Gov. Mario Cuomo) didn't do
nearly as well as anyone expected.''

   A computer hacker is answering telephones
for the Boston Bar Association as the penalty for unleashing a
rogue virus into a nationwide computer system.
   Robert Morris, 24, a former Cornell University student, began
the work several weeks ago, said Francis Moran, executive director
of the bar association.
   In May, Morris became the first person convicted under the 1986
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a felony to
intentionally gain unauthorized access to federal computers.
   A federal judge sentenced Morris, who lives in Cambridge, Mass.,
to 400 hours of community service and three years' probation. He
was fined $10,000.
   As an experiment on Nov. 2, 1988, Morris used a Cornell computer
to unleash a rogue program, called a ``worm,'' into a nationwide
network linking 180,000 computers. He was later suspended from
Cornell.
   Prosecutors alleged Morris, son of the National Security
Computer Center's chief scientist, did at least $165,000 worth of
damage.
   Morris is appealing his conviction.

   The nation's farm population dipped again last
year, but more people than ever were living in small towns, distant
suburbs and the rest of rural America, the government reported
Wednesday.
   Farm people declined by 150,000 to an estimated 4,801,000 in
1989, a decrease described by the report as ``not a statistically
significant difference'' from 1988.
   The new estimate put the farm population at 1.9 percent of the
U.S. total of more than 248.2 million people, the smallest share on
record.
   In 1980, the 6.05 million on farms represented 2.7 percent of
the 221.7 million people in the United States. And at the turn of
the century, the 1900 census showed 29.9 million living on farms,
39.3 percent of the population of 76 million.
   The annual report was released by the Census Bureau of the
Commerce Department and the Economic Research Service of the
Agriculture Department.
   Overall, the rural population was estimated at more than 66.2
million, up from just under 64.8 million people in the 1988 survey.
   The rural population includes those in living in the open
countryside and small towns not in the suburbs of large cities.
Large cities and their suburbs, plus towns of 2,500 or more, are
considered urban.
   As used in the report, the farm population consists of those
living on farms in rural areas, but does not include the relatively
few who live on farms in urban areas. A farm is defined as a place
that sold agricultural products worth $1,000 or more in the
previous year.
   Felicia LeClere of the Economic Research Service, one of the
authors, said there were no real surprises in this year's figures.
   ``The things that have come out have been long-term trends, and
none of them has been surprising,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   LeClere cautioned that all the figures are subject to revision
when the official 1990 census results are available next year. She
is confident that the annual figures are on track, however.
   Department officials have noted the increase in rural population
- rising by 12 million people since 1950 - and point out that urban
sprawl and a willingness of city workers to commute greater
distances have been important factors.
   One possible effect of the 1990 census is a reclassification of
some of these distant areas from rural to urban. That could show up
later as a slowdown in rural growth.
   The report said the largest share of the rural population, about
44 percent, continues to be in the South. That has been the case
since the first U.S. census was taken in 1790.
   ``Although the regional distribution of the rural population
changed only slightly in the last 40 years, the regional
distribution of the farm population shifted markedly,'' the report
said.
   In 1950, one-third of all farm people lived in the Midwest and
slightly more than half in the South.
   ``A rapid decline in the Southern farm population, rather than
growth in the Midwest's farm population, reversed the regional
rankings,'' the report said. ``Half of the total farm population
now lives in the Midwest, and less than a third lives in the
South.''
   Other observations in the report included:
   -Farm people continue to be older than the non-farm population
in general, with a median of 38 years in 1989, compared with 32.5
years for non-farm. A median age means half of the people are
older, half younger. Non-farm refers to urban plus rural non-farm
people.
   -Last year 97.4 percent of farm residents were white, and 1.8
percent were black, compared with 84 percent white and 12.5 percent
black in the non-farm population. The remainder were described as
of other races.
   -Only 2.9 percent of the farm residents were of Hispanic origin.
   -Nearly 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were
married and living with spouses in 1989, compared with 55.4 percent
of the non-farm people.

   An artist from Vermont won the Interior
Department's annual duck stamp competition Wednesday with her entry
showing a pair of King Eider ducks.
   Nancy Howe of East Dorset, Vt., was selected from among 626
contestants who had entered the contest that determines the design
of the 1991-92 stamp. Wildlife artists from around the country
annually compete for the right to have their design on the stamp.
   Ms. Howe, 40, will receive a pane of her winning stamp.
   Although the government provides no monetary reward for the
design, a number of artists have earned as much as $1 million from
the sale of limited-edition prints, according to officials of the
Fish and Wildlife Service, which sponsors the contest.
   The sale of duck stamps have earned $350 million for the
Interior Department since 1934 with much of the money going to
preserving millions of acres of wetlands and wildlife refuges.
   The stamps must be purchased by any hunter of waterfowl who is
16 years of age. But the artistic stamps also attract stamp
collectors and thousands of people who buy them to financially
support federal wildlife conservation programs.

   Ambitious Democrats with White House dreams
won their re-election campaigns but some will have to deal with
home-state problems and live down embarrassingly small victory
margins.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has kept himself on everyone's
list of presidential hopefuls for most of a decade, managed only 53
percent of the vote. In neighboring New Jersey, Sen. Bill Bradley
anticipated a landslide but got only 51 percent against a political
unknown.
   ``That doesn't look like presidential timber in 1992 to me,''
said Charles Black, communications director of the Republican
National Committee.
   History shows close races or even losses at the state level
don't drive a spike through a politician's heart. Richard Nixon
rebounded from losing the presidency and then the California
governorship and went on to win the White House.
   And National Democratic chairman Ron Brown said that two years
from now, ``I can't imagine that anybody will be asked what
perentage did you win by the last time you ran.''
   Regardless of his margin, Cuomo must deal with massive budget
problems in his home state before turning his sights on Washington.
He kept quiet Wednesday.
   Bradley, once a national voice on tax policy, kept mum through
much of this fall's congressional debates on the topic and became a
target of backlash against Gov. Jim Florio's tax increases.
``Voters were sending a message to Florio through Bradley,'' said
Larry Sabato, an election expert at the University of Virginia.
   Bradley on Wednesday declared again that his only plans were to
serve another six years as New Jersey senator. His media adviser,
Michael Kaye said the closeness of this year's race will be quickly
forgotten.
   ``He's not a candidate in 1992 and if he becomes a candidate at
a later date, they sure won't go back six years and replay what
happened in his race in 1990,'' he said.
   Exit polls by CBS in both New Jersey and New York showed a
plurality of voters thought Cuomo and Bradley would not make good
presidents.
   A big margin didn't guarantee a clear path to the primaries.
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas won handily with 57 percent of the
vote. But along the way he promised he'd serve his four-year term.
He'd have to break that promise to seek the presidency in 1992.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., was re-elected to his House seat.
He ran for president in 1988 and then was elected the House
Majority Leader after promising not to run for the White House
again in 1992 - a pledge other House Democrats have said they'd let
him break.
   Prospects of another run for the Democratic nomination by
Tennessee Sen. Al Gore certainly weren't hurt by the fact he got 70
percent of the vote.
   ``Now that it's over, I'll sit down and think about running (for
president), but I don't have any plans,'' Gore said. ``I haven't
ruled it out at all.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa became the first Democrat ever
re-elected in his state. On Wednesday, Harkin seemed to have the
1992 Iowa caucuses in mind.
   ``I intend to be active in the next couple of years in the
presidential process,'' he said.
   Democratic chairman Brown claimed Wednesday that Bush, who
seemed invincible a few months ago, looked beatable in 1992.
   ``I believe yesterday was a referendum on the leadership of
George Bush. he failed that test. It was, in effect, a no
confidence vote for his ... domestic agenda.''
   ``He said, `Send us more Republicans.' The American people sent
him more Democrats. I think George Bush is frankly hurt,'' Brown
said.
   But Black responded that ``Bush wasn't on the ballot
yesterday.'' If he had, and had faced the likes of Cuomo or
Bradley, ``they would have had their clocks cleaned,'' he said.
   On the Republican side, some winners probably had thoughts of
succeeding Bush in 1996.
   The eventual presidential ambitions of Republican Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, certainly were not dampened by his 62 percent
margin in that important state.
   Republicans also took over the governorship of several long-time
Democratic states, creating a new class of potential presidential
candidates.

   Hollywood tourists took a close-up
look Wednesday at a scene of destruction requiring no special
effects: the gutting of the Universal Studios backlot.
   Leaving promptly at 9:30 a.m., trams full of visitors rolled
around smoldering remains of sets from such popular films as ``The
Sting,'' ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and the ``Back to the Future''
series.
   ``The show must go on. The show will go on,'' said one tour
driver who gave his name as Larry. ``The idea is to show you all of
our backlot, only a small portion was actually damaged.''
   The only big attraction not operating the day after the blaze
was the King Kong exhibit featuring a fire-belching ape with
banana-breath.
   Studio officials said the attraction should be open in a few
days.
   Some visitors said the fire gave the tour, the third most
popular theme park in the nation, added appeal.
   ``It encouraged us to come,'' said Carolyn Garrahan of Cape Cod,
Mass., who took the tour with her husband, Tom. ``We wanted to see
the damage. We wanted to see what's left of the place.''
   Chris Bridge, who traveled with his family of four from
Australia, came to Universal City especially for the studio tour.
   ``We saw all the smoke last night,'' he said. ``It was a great
show. Much better than the elections.''
   The studio reeked of smoke and a few visitors complained of the
acrid smell. Indeed, tour driver Larry made light of some of the
damage.
   ``We have a lot of great picture-taking opportunities on the
tour today,'' he said with a laugh.
   One attraction that was not functioning was a home facade from
which flames normally leap through windows. That facade wasn't
damaged by the Tuesday night blaze, but other sets burned like
kindling.
   ``We've lost the sets, but the area will live forever on
films,'' a guide told visitors.
   More than 5 million tourists visited the studio tour last year,
and trams were filled to capacity Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Voters made few changes in Maine's
political scene, but the state's commerce was changed dramatically
by the repeal of a ``blue law'' banning sales on Sunday.
   U.S. Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, who's a former governor, failed
Tuesday in his attempt to unseat Republican Gov. John R. McKernan.
Voters re-elected U.S. Sen. William S. Cohen and six-term U.S. Rep.
Olympia J. Snowe, both Republicans.
   The Sunday sales question was forced to a vote through a
petition drive bankrolled chiefly by the state's major shopping
malls and department stores.
   Supporters of the repeal argued that citizens should be allowed
to decide for themselves whether they want to shop on Sundays.
   The opposition was led by small-store owners, who feared
competition from larger businesses. They argued repealing the law
would commercialize a day that families can spend together.
   Maine and North Dakota are the only states outlawing sales on
Sundays.
   Maine's law closed stores with at least 5,000 square feet of
floor space, except between noon and 5 p.m. on Sundays between
Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Brennan's congressional seat went to Democrat Thomas H. Andrews,
a state senator who handily defeated David F. Emery, a former
congressman and Reagan administration official.

   ``Uncle Buck'' and ``Evening Shade,'' two new
CBS situation comedies, will swap places on the network's schedule,
CBS announced Wednesday.
   ``Evening Shade,'' in which Burt Reynolds heads an all-star cast
in the comic doings of a small Arkansas town, will move to 8 p.m.
EST Monday, leading off the network's strong sitcom lineup that
night.
   ``Uncle Buck,'' a spinoff from the like-named theatrical hit,
will move into the 8 p.m. EST Friday slot. The television version
stars Kevin Meaney.
   The network has picked up both series for an entire season.
   The move followed a trial run for ``Evening Shade'' on Monday,
where the series won the highest rating of any program on any
network in the time period this season, said CBS senior executive
for program planning, Peter Tortorici.
   ```Uncle Buck' has been successful in attracting a broad and
younger audience to CBS, and we feel that it will continue to grow
in strength on Fridays at 8 p.m., a time when kids clearly control

<HEAD>NASA Sets Nov. 15 Launch Date for Atlantis</HEAD>

   After months of delays, NASA will
try to launch Atlantis next Thursday with a Pentagon spy satellite
that reportedly will gather intelligence information in the Persian
Gulf.
   NASA, meanwhile, also reported Wednesday that a special
investigative team found no pattern in a series of accidents
involving shuttle equipment.
   Atlantis was supposed to blast off in July with the spy
satellite, but the shuttle was grounded by hydrogen leaks. During
the grounding, the spacecraft reportedly was modified to spy on
Iraqi forces.
   NASA had rescheduled the launch for Friday after a fueling test
last month found Atlantis to be free of dangerous leaks. The Air
Force last week delayed the flight, however, because of undisclosed
problems that arose during cargo testing.
   Columbia, also crippled for months by leaking hydrogen, was
cleared for flight during a similar fueling test last week. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to send
Columbia on its long-delayed astronomy mission in early December.
   Columbia's seven-man crew has endured four launch attempts since
May, three of which were halted by leaking hydrogen in the final
hours before liftoff. Improperly installed seals accounted for some
of the leakage in the engine compartment.
   The investigative team, led by veteran astronaut John Young,
identified nine accidents involving shuttle equipment during the
past 13 months, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight
program. In one case, workers left a 9-foot-long, aluminum beam in
Atlantis' engine compartment last month, resulting in minor damage.
   ``They couldn't find a common thread that said the training was
bad or the workers were sleepy or they were overworked,'' Lenoir
said.
   Although the team found ``sometimes we're a little sloppy,'' the
conditions observed did not differ from findings of earlier
investigative boards during the past 1{ years, Lenoir said.
   The team recommended that more technicians be trained in
specialized rather than generic jobs, and that communications be
improved among workers, Lenoir said.
   ``A couple of the techs that they talked to felt like mushrooms
... that we perhaps don't often enough let the whole workforce know
the big picture,'' Lenoir said.
   The team also stressed the need for realistic scheduling, Lenoir
said. Before hydrogen leaks crippled two of NASA's three shuttles,
for example, NASA planned nine launches for 1990. Six will be
achieved if Atlantis and Columbia go up as planned.
   Shuttle director Robert Crippen said the 1991 flight schedule
still was being finalized.
   ``We're trying to lay out the flights, using the experience base
that we've had in the past, so we can be more realistic and
anticipate some things that are taking longer than what we'd
planned,'' Crippen said.

   Money wasn't necessarily everything in this
year's elections as some low-spending candidates ousted incumbent
governors and members of Congress.
   As usual, however, the overwhelming majority of incumbents, with
their huge fund-raising ability, were victorious.
   One of the highest profile races saw Sen. Jesse Helms buying
massive TV time and defeating Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt.
The Republican senator had raised $11 million, as of the
mid-October deadline for federal financial disclosure reports, to
Gantt's $6 million.
   ``The overwhelming campaign finance advantage held by
congressional incumbents dominated and controlled the races,'' said
Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance watchdog group
Common Cause.
   In some races, however, winners upset better-financed opponents
- notably Paul Wellstone over Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz in
Minnesota, former Sen. Lawton Chiles ousting Republican Gov. Guy
Martinez in Florida, and Democratic challenger Joan Finney beating
Gov. Mike Hayden in Kansas.
   In Rhode Island, the tables were turned with Republican Gov. Ed
DiPrete being outspent 2-1 - and defeated - by Democrat Bruce
Sundlun.
   In Texas, Democrat Ann Richards beat Republican oilman Clayton
Williams despite Williams' heavy spending, incl million of
his own money.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., withstood a challenge from wealthy
businessman James Rappaport after Rappaport poured more than $3
million in personal loans into his campaign. Kerry, who reported
raising more than $5 million as of mid-October, still outspent
Rappaport, who had raised $3.7 million by the same time.
   ``Today in Massachusetts, we have proven that money can't buy
you a U.S. Senate seat,'' Kerry said after winning.
   The outcome in the New Jersey Senate race was noteworthy for how
close challenger Christine Whitman came to defeating incumbent
Democrat Bill Bradley - despite Bradley's huge spending edge.
Bradley, who spent $12.6 million to her $1 million, according to
figures supplied by their campaigns, won by just two percentage
points.
   In a case similar to Bradley's, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, barely
kept his seat against a much poorer challenger. By mid-October, the
incumbent had raised $1.3 million against $274,000 for Democratic
challenger David Worley.
   ``Worley had problems with money. He might have been able to
beat Gingrich easily'' with better financing, said Sabato.
   But the overall pattern of incumbents raising the most money and
holding their seats held true.
   In the Florida governor's race, Chiles defeated Martinez
although Chiles imposed a $100 limit on donations to his campaign.
While Martinez had a 2-1 money edge over Chiles, the Democrat - by
virtue of his reputation as a former senator - was in a better
position to do without the extra money than most challengers would
need.
   In Minnesota, Wellstone beat Boschwitz after a campaign in which
the senator raised nearly $5 million by mid-October to less than
$800,000 for Wellstone.
   ``Our campaign really relied on the shoe leather power of just
volunteers,'' Wellstone said.
   Victories such as Wellstone's ``show that money is not always
the price of admission. Special circumstances mean that voters do
what they want to do,'' said Larry Sabato, a professor of
government at the University of Virginia.
   Across the country, however, only 13 of 406 House members who
had sought reelection were defeated, not counting two undecided
California races.
   Several of the 13 heavily outspent their victorious opponents,
including Reps. Bill Grant, R-Fla.; Roy Dyson, D-Md.; John
Buechner, R-Mo.; Doug Walgren, D-Pa., and Robert Kastenmeier,
D-Wis.

   Environmentalists say they are already
preparing for 1992 following the defeat of California's landmark
``Big Green'' environmental initiative.
   ``It's going to be a longer battle than we'd hoped,'' said Susan
Birmingham of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ``The
challenge for us is to keep pounding away.''
   Backers and opponents of Big Green offered conflicting
explanations for its proposal's defeat Tuesday.
   State Chamber of Commerce President Kirk West, co-chairman of
the campaign against the initiative, said he thought his forces
``convinced the voters that it tried to do too much, covered too
many subjects.''
   But environmentalists said voters defeated ``Big Green'' because
of unfounded fears fostered by opponents that it would hurt their
pocketbooks. Activists vowed to press their cause.
   ``Big Green'' would have provided $300 million in bond money to
buy and preserve ancient redwood forests. It aimed to slow global
warming by curbing auto and other emissions. And it would have
banned oil development in state waters and barred pesticides
suspected of causing cancer.
   Proponents, who spent $4.5 million, said the initiative would
have saved Californians several billion dollars a year in energy
and health costs.
   Corporations, including major oil companies based outside the
state, spent $10 million condemning the measure as an economic
disaster. Its controls would have increased gas, electricity and
food prices while falling short of environmental cleanup goals,
they said.
   Three other environmental proposals were toppled along with Big
Green, which lost by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.
   Fifty-three percent of the voters opposed ``Forests Forever,''
which would have restricted clear-cutting of forests and authorized
$740 million in bonds for the purchase of old-growth redwoods.
   Two industry countermeasures to ``Big Green'' and ``Forests
Forever,'' with far weaker controls on timber and pesticides, were
also soundly rejected.
   Polls showed that the maze of four conflicting initiatives
confused voters, a hazard that analysts predicted could lead to
general rejection of the measures.
   ``I don't think that anybody who voted against `Big Green' voted
for polluted air or cancer-causing chemicals,'' said Bob Hattoy of
the Sierra Club.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp, also a primary sponsor
of the measure, said voters were almost universally conservative
when it came to spending money on new programs because ``of a
confluence of events.''
   ``I think the invasion of Kuwait, the beginning of the
recession, the national budget crisis, the state budget crisis -
all those things have scared people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration banned 223
ingredients in over-the-counter drugs Wednesday, saying
manufacturers had offered no proof they were effective for problems
they were supposed to treat.
   The ingredients ranged from pine tar in dandruff fighters
through dehydrated garlic in digestive aids to aspirin in
medications for external use.
   The FDA did not ban the ingredients entirely, just in certain
uses. For example, aspirin may still be used in products for pain
relief taken internally, because it has been shown to be effective
pain reliever.
   The over-the-counter drug industry said most of the ingredients
already had been withdrawn, but some familiar drugstore and
supermarket products still will be affected, the agency said.
   For example, Tegrin Lotion, sold for use against psoriasis, may
no longer contain allantoin. Also Packers shampoo and soap may not
contain pine tar, and Donnagel, used to treat diarrhea, may no
longer include atropine sulfate, hyoscyamine sulfate and
scopolamine hydrobromide.
   The ban becomes effective in six months. The agency said none of
the ingredients posed a safety problem in any of the banned uses.
   The ruling is part of an 18-year-long review of about 300,000
nonprescription products that were on the market in 1972.
   As part of its effort to complete that review, the agency last
week proposed to ban 111 drug ingredients in over-the-counter diet
products. Most companies have stopped using those ingredients,
industry officials said.
   Manufacturers have been on notice since May that the agency
wanted to ban the list of 223 ingredients, and most have
reformulated their products, said Jack Walden, a spokesman of the
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
   ``Overwhelmingly, this is a housekeeping action,'' he said.
``The industry long ago came into compliance ... It affects
products now on the market very, very little.''
   Dean Siegal, a spokesman for Block Drug Co. Inc., which makes
Tegrin Lotion for psoriasis, said the company has been
reformulating its product and expects to have a new one out soon.
``This is not new news,'' he said.
   But Walden said that some companies disagree with the FDA's
assertion that the action was being taken ``based on the absence of
substantive comment or failure to submit new data.''
   ``Some of our companies disagree that they failed to submit data
and are in contact with FDA on this matter,'' Walden said.
   He did not identify those companies, the products or
ingredients.
   Other banned ingredients are used in, among other things,
topical acne drug products, antiperspirant products, cough and cold
medications, laxatives, nailbiting and thumbsucking deterrents,
poison treatments asnd drug products used to help people stop
smoking.
   Within a few months, the agency expects to be about halfway
through the massive review of nonprescription products it began in
1972, said spokeswoman Bonnie Aikman.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a fighting
mood amid talk of a move to oust her, on Wednesday defended her
brake on the European Community's drive toward closer unity.
   ``You don't secure the sort of Europe we want by a policy of
always going along with what others propose simply for fear of
being left out,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a major speech after the
opening of a new yearlong session of Parliament.
   ``We want to work closely with our European friends ... but we
also want to preserve our national currency and the sovereignty of
this House of Commons,'' she said.
   On the gulf crisis, she declared: ``Time is running out for
Saddam Hussein. ... Either he gets out of Kuwait soon or we and our
allies will remove him by force and he will go down to defeat.''
   Rank-and-file Conservative Party legislators waved their
programs in support as Mrs. Thatcher rose to address the Commons
for the first time since her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned
last Thursday in protest of her combative stance on Europe.
   Howe, who remains a legislator, listened impassively from near
the back of the packed rows of leather benches behind the prime
minister.
   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock twitted Mrs. Thatcher that her
``government is divided right through the middle.''
   ``The British people will get rid of you at the general election
as soon as you have the guts to call it!'' he shouted, struggling
to make himself heard above the jeers of Conservative legislators.
   The bad-tempered exchanges erupted hours after Queen Elizabeth
II opened the parliamentary session with the traditional glittering
pageantry.
   The monarch, dressed in a flowing white gown and red robe and
wearing the jewel-encrusted imperial crown, outlined an
exceptionally light legislative program for the coming year in a
speech written by the government.
   Proposals included a measure to permit privately financed road
building and new anti-terrorism legislation for Northern Ireland.
The government also will reintroduce a bill that would allow it to
try suspected Nazi war criminals. The measure was previously
defeated in the unelected House of Lords.
   The slim legislative program would leave Mrs. Thatcher free to
call an election next year, a year before her third five-year term
expires.
   However, with a dispute over the pace and extent of European
union - on top of economic troubles - the Conservatives are running
as much as 20 points behind Labor in opinion polls.
   The annual election among Tory legislators for the party leader
- who is automatically the prime minister - is set for Nov. 20.
Mrs. Thatcher moved it from Dec. 5, and the new date was widely
seen as a move to cut short campaigning time for rivals.
   But the half-dozen potential heavyweight rivals, who include
Howe and ex-Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, have said they
will not challenge this year. They apparently fear they cannot get
sufficient votes.
   Mrs. Thatcher, isolated 11-to-1 in the European Community,
rejected a plan approved at a summit meeting last month for a
single currency and closer political ties. She sees the moves as a
surrender of Parliament's sovereign powers.

<TEXT>
   Pete Townshend, guitarist for The Who, has
divulged his bisexuality in a interview in a new book in which he
says ``I know how it feels to be a woman.''
   Townshend, who has been married to Karen Astley since 1966 and
has three children, revealed that he has been involved in
homosexual relationships in the past.
   He made the statements in the new book, ``Rock Lives: Profiles
and Interviews,'' a collection of interviews by music writer and
radio host Timothy White.
   ``I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman,''
Townshend said in an interview with White that ran on White's radio
show in September 1989. ``And I won't be classified as just a
man.''
   Townshend said his aversion to the macho rock star ethos
surfaced publicly in the ``Rough Boys'' song on the 1980 album,
Empty Glass.
   Townshend called the song a ``coming out, an acknowledgment of
the fact that I'd had a gay life, and tht I understood what gay
sex was about.''
   ``It was a real acknowledgment of the fact that I'd been
surrounded by people that I really adored - and was actually
sexually attracted to - who were men. And that side of me that
responded to those people was a passive side, a subordinate side.''
   Townshend, who was surprised to find a strong female audience
with his solo LP, said he believes he drew women because he was
``honest. Not necessarily by saying, `I am gay.' But just by being
honest about the fact that I understand how gay people feel and I
identify.''

<TEXT>
   The last U.S. game of the world chess
championship began Wednesday with organizers and aficionados
declaring the American segment of the tournament a success.
   Defending champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov
were tied at 5{-5{ before Game 12 began.
   Each of the players won one game. There were nine draws.
   ``There was a lowered expectation about turnout when we started
but we've been delighted at how many people showed up from all over
the world,'' said Adam Black, a spokesman for championship
organizers. ``Interest has not waned. People have called and come
from all over.''
   The second half of the championship begins Nov. 24 in Lyons,
France. The first player to gain 12{ points wins the championship
and $1.7 million of a $3 million purse. Opening ceremonies in
France were scheduled for Nov. 23.
   Serious chess players and casual observers, paying $25 to $100
for tickets, crowded the Hudson Theater and adjoining Hotel
Macklowe in midtown Manhattan during each of the 12 games in New
York.
   Several analysis rooms, where chess grandmasters explained and
dissected moves, were filled almost every night. About 500
journalists covered some or all of the games.
   Grandmaster Patrick Wolff, who did commentary during the
matches, said the biggest surprise was the disparity in the games.
   Wolff said that the first four games could be considered the
best first four games in world championship history. But games six
through nine were ``terrible,'' he said. The final games were a
slight improvement, Wolff said.
   Chess experts had expected Kasparov to maintain a substantial
lead over Karpov, but Karpov surprised them by more than holding
his own, Wolff said.
   The two, known for their dislike of one another, nonetheless
were polite during the 12 matches in New York.
   ``They've been cordial to each other,'' said Wolff. ``Of course
they don't like each other but they've played so much they're used
to each other.''

   Democrats pointed Wednesday to their
strengthened majorities in the House and Senate as evidence of a
new mandate to carry their ``fairness'' theme forward in 1991.
   With House Democrats padding their 259-176 edge by an expected
nine seats and Senate Democrats expanding their majority by one in
Tuesday's elections, the party held its tightest grip on
legislative power in more than a decade.
   ``I think the issue of fairness and balance of burden sharing
was well received,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and
that will be reflected in any new tax legislation that may arise
next year.
   Foley said in a telephone interview that he was not predicting
new taxes, but added: ``Some would predict the surcharge on
million-dollar incomes has not disappeared from the scene.''
   He said Democrats also saw the election results as impetus to
pursue their agenda of health care, education and infrastructure
improvements in the coming session of Congress.
   Republicans dismissed any notion that the outcome represented a
mandate. They said their losses were a victory of sorts because
they fell short of the level normally suffered by the party that
holds the White House in non-presidential elections.
   The Democrats also took aim at President Bush.
   ``Americans read George Bush's lips yesterday, and they made it
clear they didn't like his message,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony,
D-Ark., chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee.
   ``All over the country, voters snubbed candidates Bush
campaigned for, showing Bush has no coattails,'' Anthony said at a
post-election news conference.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown called the
congressional budget debate that ended barely a week before
Election Day the most significant issue in this year's voting, and
in particular the idea of taxing those most able to pay.
   ``George Bush clearly demonstrated that they are on the side of
the rich and we are on the side of the working man and woman,''
said Brown, reiterating a familiar theme that the party believes is
working to its advantage.
   Brown said Democrats owed their success to an agenda that calls
for aid for education, jobs and health care. ``Voters looked to
Democrats to fight for the bread-and-butter issues that Bush finds
so distracting and beneath him.''
   The results reflect ``an anti-incumbent sentiment, and the
incumbent who turned out to be the biggest target was the
president,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., head of the party's
Senate campaign arm.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the losses
weren't ``due to any kind of national trend, I don't think, or
issue, so much as it was something about (each) individual
member.''
   But Michel added: ``It sure as heck doesn't make the job any
easier'' of carrying forward Bush's legislative agenda in the next
two years.
   Democrats also were gleeful at the close call suffered by Rep.
Newt Gingrich, the combative No. 2 Republican leader in the House.
Gingrich won by less than 1,000 votes, and his Democratic opponent,
David Worley, requested a recount.
   The ambush by Worley clearly caught Gingrich by surprise. One
GOP official said the Georgian's polls showed him ahead with 57
percent support just a few days before the election.
   ``Newt Gingrich now becomes target No. 1 for 1992 if he wins the
recount,'' Anthony said.
   The outcomes in two California districts remained up in the air,
with two Democratic incumbents - Reps. Doug Bosco and Jim Bates -
trailing by narrow margins.
   If those seats were to fall the way they were leaning, the final
House lineup for the 102nd Congress would be 268 Democrats and 167
Rpublicans.
   Several races remained subject to possible recounts, including
the 52-vote margin by which Joan Kelly Horn, a Democrat, appeared
to have defeated two-term Republican Rep. Jack Buechner.
   In the Senate, the only shift was in Minnesota where college
professor and political unknown Paul Wellstone dealt a stunning
upset to two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rudy Boschwitz. That
left the Democratic majority at 56 to 44.

<HEAD>Wilson Elected California Governor; Big Green Environmental Measure
Fails</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's new governor, Republican Pete
Wilson, is heading to the capitol in Sacramento surrounded by
Democrats in most top state offices and facing a hostile
Legislature.
   With a handful of precincts and an estimated 500,000 absentee
ballots remaining to be counted Wednesday, Wilson had 3,473,487
votes, or 49 percent, to Democrat Dianne Feinstein's 3,287,109
votes, or 46 percent. Three minor party candidates divvied up the
remaining 5 percent.
   But Democrats increased their majorities in both houses of the
Legislature, won five other statewide offices and were leading
narrowly in a sixth statewide race.
   In state and local ballot propositions, voters said ``No'' - no
to environmental initiatives, no to all state and most local tax
increases, no to an unprecedented number of bond issues, and no to
the existing leadership of the Legislature.
   The omnibus ``Big Green'' environmental initiative, Proposition
128, was defeated by a 2-1 margin. Big Green was a sweeping plan to
phase out cancer-causing pesticides, ban chemicals that harm the
ozone, and reduce emissions of gases that contribute to global
warming.
   But voters also rejected two alternative initiatives by timber
and agricultural interests and Proposition 130, a parallel forest
protection measure.
   Penny-a-drink and nickel-a-drink alcohol tax increases, a
statewide sales tax hike for anti-crime programs and 12 of 14
statewide bond issues were defeated by voters in the first massive
rejection of statewide bonds in California history.
   Santa Clara County voters rejected a proposal to raise utility
taxes to finance a stadium to lure baseball's San Francisco Giants.
   Altogether, 22 of the 28 statewide propositions were turned
down. Of all of the high-profile statewide initiatives, the only
one that passed, Proposition 140, had a strong negative message to
politicians of both parties.
   Proposition 140 will force every current member of the state
Legislature out of office by either 1996 or 1998, eliminate
legislative pensions and slash the Legislature's budget and staff
by about 40 percent.
   For the 57-year-old Wilson, who unsuccessfully sought the
governor's office twice before, in 1978 and again in 1982, before
switching to a successful race for the U.S. Senate, his victory is
not without some dark political clouds.
   Wilson faces an estimated deficit of $500 million to $2 billion
in the state budget he must submit five days after his Jan. 7
inauguration. And he faces a Legislature in which leaders of both
parties fought the term limits measure which Wilson endorsed.
   As close as the governor's race was, the race between Democrat
Arlo Smith and Republican Dan Lungren for attorney general was
tighter. The winner may not be known for another week.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Smith led Lungren 47
percent to 46 percent. Election officials said as many as 500,000
absentee ballots, which traditionally favor Republicans, remained
to be counted.
   Controller Gray Davis and Secretary of State March Fong Eu, both
Democrats, were also re-elected. Davis defeated Eu's Republican
son, Matt Fong, for controller.
   Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown, the daughter of former
Gov. Pat Brown and sister of former Gov. Jerry Brown, defeated
Republican incumbent Thomas Hayes for treasurer.
   Although Democrats won the lion's share of California races
Tuesday, Wilson's victory as governor gives Republicans hope for
some gains in 1992, since he will hold veto power over the new
districts which must be drawn next year to reflect population
shifts in this year's federal census.
   California's congressional delegation will increase from the
current 45 to 52 or more seats in 1992.

<HEAD>Bennett To Leave Drug Czar Job This Month, White House Confirms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 14th graf bgng, `Dogoloff said,' to FIX to 20 months in
office, sted 18</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett is resigning as the first
director of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy after
leading what the White House called ``a turnaround'' in the battle
against the drug scourge.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush will
formally accept Bennett's resignation in a ceremony at the White
House on Thursday.
   Fitzwater denied that the resignation was prompted by threats,
saying that Bennett ``has lived with threats of a kind ever since
day one of the job.''
   A successor for the job has not been named, the spokesman said.
   Bennett leaves office only two weeks after another senior
administration official, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, became
the first member of Bush's cabinet to resign.
   Bennett, a former secretary of education, became director the
nation's anti-drug efforts at the beginning of the Bush
administration. He helped to coordinate some 27 departments and
agencies involved in the drug war.
   ``The president feels that Bill Bennett has provided
extraordinary leadership and service to the country during his
tenure as drug czar,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``Two years ago this country viewed this problem as impossible
to deal with and with no end in sight,'' the spokesman said.
``Today there has been a turnaround. There is strong bipartisan
support in the Congress for drug programs and there is growing
evidence that society is beginning to turn away from the drug
scourge.''
   However, leading House Democrat John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan
said Bennett ``was the personification of a drug strategy of the
last 10 years that failed.''
   Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee
that created the drug office, said Bennett's resignation ``provides
the opportunity for someone without Bennett's partisan
politicizing, more sensitive to the problems of the chronically
addicted, minorities, and the poor in urban areas, and cognizant of
the need for economic rather than military foreign drug
assistance.''
   An administration official who ask not to be identified said
that Bennett feels he ``has done all that he told the president he
would get done. He feels he's done what he came to do in the job
and it was time to get on with his life.''
   Lee I. Dogoloff, executive director of the non-governmental
American Council for Drug Education, said that Bennett's plans to
leave ``have been rumored for some time'' among groups in America's
war on drugs.
   ``It's not surprising,'' said Dogoloff. ``I talked to him
several months ago and he said then that he had not taken a
lifetime assignment.''
   Dogoloff said that many in the field give Bennett high marks for
accomplishment during the 20 months since he was confirmed as the
nation's first drug czar. The position was created in the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988.
   ``He can feel good that the numbers are turning around in the
drug war,'' said Dogoloff. ``We haven't solved the problem, by any
means, but the data shows it is getting better.''
   Recent reports show that the number of patients treated for drug
overdose in the nation's hospitals has gone down and that there is
a reduction in the purity of cocaine available on the streets.
Dogoloff said that professionals regard these as important signs
that the drug problem ``is trending downward.''
   Threats against Bennett have intensified in recent days, but an
official said they have always been there.
   ``There was a nut who called in, and there were bomb threats
when he was in Alaska,'' he said. ``They did beef up security
some.'' Bennett campaigned in Alaska for a law that would make
illegal the possession of small amounts of marijuana.
   ``I don't think these threats influenced his decision to leave.
He's tough as nails. But he does have a family,'' said the
official.
   ``Anybody who has that job is a target,'' said Dogoloff.
   Bennett is married and has two small children.
   Published reports have suggested that Bennett's replacement may
be former District of Columbia superior court judge Reggie Walton,
who is now associate drug control director for state and local
affairs in Bennett's office.
   The Washington Times said former D.C. police chief Maurice
Turner, defeated Tuesday in a bid for Washington mayor, is also a
possible candidate for the job.

<HEAD>Burned Studio Lot Held Some of Hollywood's Most Famous Sets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Universal Fire</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arsonist visited Hollywood's
biggest fantasy factory with a dose of reality, a backlot inferno
that destroyed some of Universal Studio's historic sets.
   Tuesday night's fire destroyed New York Street, where parts of
``The Sting'' were filmed, and the ``Dick Tracy'' facades.
Brownstone Street and Courthouse Square, where Michael J. Fox rode
his jet-powered skateboard in ``Back to the Future Part II,'' was
damaged.
   Surviving tour attractions included the simulated earthquake
ride, the shark-snapping Jaws exhibit, the flash flood area, the
parting of the Red Sea, the ice tunnel, the ``Psycho'' house and
Bates Motel.
   Also untouched by flame were such famous television and movie
locations as Colonial Street, where Beaver Cleaver and Marcus Welby
lived, the fictional town of Amity and the area where ``Murder, She
Wrote'' is filmed, the Six Points, Texas, Old West section and
Little Europe, where the 1930s film ``Frankenstein'' was filmed.
   Warner Bros., Paramount and Goldwyn have suffered devastating
fires over the years, and Universal was equally vulnerable. Film
studios, with their wooden sets baked dry by the sun, are a
firefighter's nightmare.
   Fortunately, firefighters were able to save all but four acres
of the 420-acre complex.
   Universal has operated continuously from its opening on March
15, 1915, pouring forth entertainment that ranged from two-reel
Westerns to ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' the biggest mneymaking
film in history.
   The studio also has produced thousands of television shows, from
``Leave It to Beaver'' to ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   From its earliest years, Universal profited by showing tourists
how movies are made. Founder Carl Laemmle charged 50 cents for
tourists to stand on a platform and watch silent movies being made.
   Millions each year now pay $22 ($16.50 for children) to
experience the Universal Studios Tour.
   A German immigrant, Laemmle opened his studio on 230 acres of
mountainside ranch five miles north of Hollywood, persuading the
city of Los Angeles to let him call it Universal City.
   The hillsides were ideal for Westerns, and there was ample space
to build sets for spectacles such as ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   The studio grew, but Laemmle was never able to match the class
products of MGM, Paramount, Fox and Warner Bros. The company
stumbled along, saved from bankruptcy by Deanna Durbin in the '30s
and Abbott and Costello in the '40s.
   After MCA, a former talent agency, acquired Universal in 1962,
the studio's rickety bungalows were bulldozed, giving way to a tall
glass building known as the Black Tower.
   Sound stages were modernized and attractions built to enhance
the studio tour. Two hotels, an amphitheater, a multi-screen movie
theater complex and restaurants now stand atop the summit of the
studio.
   Universal television has long been a steady moneymaker. The film
division has had ups and downs, but periodically produces block
busters like ``E.T.'' ``Jaws,'' ``Back to the Future,'' ``The
Sting,'' ``Animal House,'' ``On Golden Pond,'' ``Smokey and the
Bandit'' and ``Twins.''
   Universal has remained the most picturesque of all studios with
its sprawl of sets, ranging from the big city streets used for
``Dick Tracy,'' the town square of ``Back to the Future,'' the
Bates Motel of ``Psycho,'' plus waterfalls, lagoons, western towns
and cowboy trails.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Lifts Pakistan's State of Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted
Pakistan's 3-month-old state of emergency on Wednesday, his first
day on the job.
   The emergency, which gave the army sweeping powers to suspend
individual rights to maintain law and order, was imposed on Aug. 6
- hours after Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed for alleged
corruption.
   In a speech broadcast on state television and radio, Sharif said
he wanted the new government headed by his right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance to begin in ``an open atmosphere of human
freedom.''
   ``Democracy and fundamental rights are synonymous. There is no
justification for continuing the emergency during the tenure of an
elected government coming to power with the support of the
masses,'' Sharif said.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan declared the emergency shortly after
ejecting Ms. Bhutto's government on charges of corruption,
incompetence and abuse of power. He cited internal and external
threats.
   The emergency would have expired in another month.
   Sharif, a wealthy 41-year-old industrialist, was a protege of
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who ruled Pakistan for 11 years until his
death in a still unexplained plane crash in August 1988.
   As chief minister of eastern Punjab, the powerhouse of Pakistani
politics, Sharif was Ms. Bhutto's chief rival during her 20 months
in power.
   He orchestrated the alliance's overwhelming victory over Ms.
Bhutto and her populist Pakistan People's Party in the Oct. 24
parliamentary elections.
   Sharif was elected prime minister on Tuesday, commanding
two-thirds of the 217-member National Assembly, or the lawmaking
lower house of Parliament. He was sworn in later that day as the
head of Pakistan's fifth freely elected government in 43 years.
   With the transfer of power completed, Sharif said the emergency
was no longer necessary.
   ``It does not behoove an elected prime minister to depend on the
crutches of extraordinary laws to maintain law and order in the
country,'' he said in the speech, delivered in the Urdu language.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, deposed as
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader in the 1968 Soviet
invasion, said Wednesday he felt no anger against the current
Kremlin leadership.
   ``My presence here as well as the changes that take place in
Czechoslovakia are ... due to the changes in the Soviet Union,''
said the 68-year-old Dubcek, who became the Czechoslovak parliament
speaker after last November's ouster of the nation's Communist
government.
   The invasion by Soviet troops and other Warsaw Pact soldiers
ended Dubcek's careful attempt at democratization known as the
``Prague spring.'' He was expelled from the Communist Party and
eventually found a job as a mechanic with a state-owned forestry
firm.
   ``I don't feel any personal resentment,'' he said, citing Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   ``The Soviet Union is no threat. ... We should focus on what we
have in common and not on what divides us,'' he said.
   Dubcek, who was invited to the Netherlands by Dutch Parliament,
will be meeting with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek on Thursday.
   Czechoslovakia is especially interested in Dutch electronics and
pollution control expertise, Dubcek said.
   Like many other Eastern European countries, Czechoslovakia
struggles with environmental problems linked to antiquated
industry.

   A prosecutor on Wednesday sought the
indictment of two alleged Japanese terrorists for the bombing of a
USO club in 1988 that killed an American servicewoman and four
others, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   Assistant Prosecutor Alfonso Barbarano requested the indictment
of Junzo Okudaira, 43, and Fusako Shigenobu, 45, reputed members of
the Japanese Red Army, the dispatch said. The two have been
fugitives for years.
   The U.S. servicewoman and four Italians were killed and 15
people were wounded when a car bomb blew up in front of the USO
Club in Naples on April 14, 1988.
   Investigators believe Okudaira has been involved in other terror
attacks, including one on the U.S. Embassy in Rome in 1987 that did
not injure anyone. Shigenobu has been identified as the leader of
the Japanese Red Army, which is linked with terrorist groups in
Lebanon.
   The Naples bombing coincided with the second anniversary of the
U.S. bombing of Libya. That attack was in retaliation for what the
U.S. government called Libyan support of terrorism.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's information minister, reacting to
a saber-rattling speech Wednesday by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, said she was mentally unbalanced and possessed
by the devil.
   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency,
Minister Latif Nassayif Jassim said Mrs. Thatcher's statements in
general on the gulf crisis were hysterical in tone and did not
befit the office of prime minister.
   Her speeches, ``filled with rancor and hatred toward the Iraqi
people, and her continued calls for beating the drums of war
unequivocally show beyond a shadow of a doubt that this woman ...
has lost her mental balance,'' the statement said.
   Jassim said the only explanation for a woman advocating war was
that ``the devil has found a comfortable dwelling within her mind
and conscience.''
   The Iraqi minister said his country viewed Mrs. Thatcher's
statements with ``disdain and indifference,'' and that her
popularity in Britain would not be boosted by fighting or calling
for war.
   In Parliament on Wednesday, Thatcher warned Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that he will face a military strike if he does not
withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   ``The implacable message of this House must be: Either he gets
out of Kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by force
and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences,'' she
said. ``He has been warned.''
   Britain has about 10,000 troops with 120 tanks in Saudi Arabia,
as well as 10 warships enforcing the U.N. trade embargo imposed on
Iraq after it seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   A Sotheby's auction of contemporary art brought
in $19.9 million, about half the amount expected in an end to a
recent price explosion, the auction house said.
   Sotheby's had expected the Tuesday sale to bring $39.6 million
to $52 million.
   ``The contemporary art market over the last few years has been a
price explosion, and what we have seen tonight is a return to price
levels of about November 1988,'' said Diana Phillips, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's.
   The sale of 34 works of contemporary art brought prices back to
earth, Phillips said. Forty three other pieces did not draw minimum
bids and were not sold.
   The highlight of the auction was a 1961 work by American artist
Robert Rauschenberg, ``Third Time Painting.'' It fetched $3.08
million from a private European collector, said Phillips. The
estimate on the Rauschenberg was revised downward Monday, from
$4-$5 million to $3-$4 million.
   The Rauschenberg, showing a clock, a chain, a shirt and a broken
bottle neck, is combines oil, paper, fabric, wood, metal and glass.
   The sale of other works also reflected the soft market, pulling
down prices that increased about 20 times since 1984, most
dramatically in the past two years, Phillips said.
   The second highest price of the evening - $2.6 million - came
for French painter Jean Dubuffet's ``Maison Sondee,'' a 1961 Paris
scene. The oil on canvas was bought by a Chicago dealer.
   The third highest priced work, auctioned for $2.3 million, was
another Dubuffet, ``Vaches Au Pre.'' The oil on canvas painted in
1954 depicts one of Dubuffet's favorite subjects, cows.
   The American painter Cy Twombly's 1967 oil on blackboard,
``Untitled,'' sold for $1.9 million.
   ``Most of the sale was bought by private collectors who are
serious and committed,'' Phillips said. ``The speculators who have
been present during the price explosion were completely absent from
tonight's activity.''
   ``Many of the lots that did not sell were by artists whose works
have gained quickly in value over the last few years,'' she said.

   President Bush probably will meet with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Paris this month, the White House
said Wednesday.
   The meeting would come during a five-nation trip that also will
mark the first visit to Czechoslovakia by an American president.
   It would be Bush's fourth summit with Gorbachev, following talks
in Malta, Washington and Helsinki.
   While no date has been set for a meeting with Gorbachev, Bush
will be in Paris from Nov. 18 until Nov. 21, when he flies to the
Middle East to visit U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and confer with
leaders there and in Egypt.
   In Paris, Bush will attend the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe and sign a treaty to cut non-nuclear
forces in Europe.
   Bush will leave Washington Nov. 16, flying overnight to Prague
and arriving there early the next day.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president
would express strong support for the democratic revolution in
Czechoslovakia and throughout Eastern Europe and deliver a major
speech about the democracy movement.
   Bush also will make brief remarks in Wenceslas Square, where
hundreds of thousands of people gathered last November to begin the
so-called Velvet Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the
country's hardline communist rulers.
   Fitzwater noted that Czechoslovakia is suffering economic
problems compounded by a reduction in Soviet energy deliveries and
the loss of Iraqi oil. ``We're working through various
international financial organizations to help Czechoslovakia bridge
this energy gap and I'm sure this will be part of the discussion,''
Fitzwater said.
   En route to Paris on Nov. 18, Bush will stop in Germany for
several hours to visit the city of Speyer and to visit with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl at his home in suburban Oggersheim.

   Many hundreds more combat troops from the
Marine Corps Reserve are likely to be ordered to active duty for
Operation Desert Shield, an official said Wednesday.
   The Marines on Tuesday said 824 reservists, including 633 combat
specialists, were being activated to become part of a specially
tailored 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade that is undergoing desert
warfare training in California.
   Those were the first combat reserve forces to be put on active
duty in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Col. Russell Appleton, head of manpower policy and planning at
Marine Corps headquarters, said in an interview Wednesday that
reserves will be used to help form expeditionary brigades to
replace units scheduled to rotate out of the gulf area.
   The Marines have not said when the first units deployed in
Desert Shield will return home, but it appears some may be brought
back after serving about six months.
   Appleton said the call-up of reservists for the 5th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade is a model of how Marine combat reserves are
expected to be used for Desert Shield.
   ``You're seeing the tip of that spear'' of reserve deployments,
he said, adding that he could not comment on any reserve call-ups
beyond those announced Tuesday.
   ``Fifty-seven percent of our force is overseas,'' he said. ``If
you've got to replace that force then the math says there aren't
enough active duty units out there to do that,'' and so a sizeable
number of reserves will be needed.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has authorized the Marines to call
as many as 3,000 reserves to active duty for 90-day periods.

   A car bomb exploded Wednesday near the
unoccupied office of a Syrian-backed militia in east Beirut,
killing three people and injuring seven, police said.
   Members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party left the office
only hours before the explosion of more than 100 pounds of dynamite
packed into a sedan.
   The group occupied the office in the predominately Christian
sector after the Oct. 13 downfall of rebel Christian Gen. Michel
Aoun. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the
bombing in the Aukar area.
   The office belonged to Christian warlord Samir Geagea's militia
until Jan. 30, when Aoun's forces ousted Geagea's troops from the
Metn mountains.
   A police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules
identified the victims as the owner of a bakery and his two
children. Among the injured were three Lebanese reporters working
for the conservative daily Ad-Diyar.
   The police spokesman said investigators estimated 110 pounds of
dynamite was concealed in the trunk of the beige-colored car that
carried no plates. He refused to give further details.
   The office is in the suburban district of Aukar, about six miles
northeast of Beirut. The suburb is the site of the closed American
Embassy.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
mandate.

<HEAD>Hrawi Sets 10-Day Deadline to Unite Beirut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi's government on
Wednesday set a 10-day deadline for Christian and Moslem militias
to withdraw from Beirut so that the city can be reunited as a
demilitarized zone.
   Unifying the war-battered capital, divided into Christian and
Moslem sectors since April 1975, is a key element in an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's protracted civil war.
   A statement issued after a two-hour Cabinet meeting said the
final stage of creating a demilitarized ``Greater Beirut'' will
begin on Saturday and is scheduled for completion Nov.19.
   The major militias on both sides agreed to withdraw their
fighters and weapons from the city after the Syrian Army crushed
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun on Oct. 13, removing the main obstacle
to the peace plan.
   But Wednesday's statement was the first time the government has
set a deadline for the reunification process that began immediately
after Aoun was defeated in a fierce eight-hour battle that left at
least 550 people dead.
   In the last few weeks, much of the Green Line that divided the
capital has been dismantled and there are no longer any
restrictions on travel between the Christian eastern sector and the
Moslem west side.
   Wednesday's statement did not specify the exact boundaries of
``Greater Beirut.''
   But earlier statements by government officials said it would
extend from the Dog River north of Beirut to the Damour River south
of the city, and six to nine miles inland from the Mediterranean.
   The government did not say what would happen if its deadline was
not met. But the Syrians, the main powerbrokers in Lebanon, have
40,000 troops in the country and have pledged Hrawi all the backing
he needs to implement the peace plan.
   Hrawi is trying to rebuild the Lebanese Army, for years
fractured along sectarian lines. At present, military sources said
he has an effective combat force of only about 9,000 Moslem troops
under his army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud.
   Until he can reunify the army, which had a nominal overall
strenth of about 42,000, Hrawi will be dependent on the Syrians for
his military muscle.
   Although the main militias have gone along with the plan to
demilitarize the capital, most are hesitant about handing over
their weapons and disbanding so state authority can be extended
over more of the country.
   The main militias are the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces,
a pro-Syrian splinter faction called the Lebanese Forces-Executive
Authority, the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Hezbollah or Party of God,
the rival Syrian-backed Shiite Amal movement and the Druse Moslem
Progressive Socialist Party.
   Wednesday's statement said: ``Any attempt to obstruct or stall
the process of creating Greater Beirut will be dealt with severely.
There shall be no tolerance.''
   It said Justice Minister Edmond Rizk had been authorized to take
legal procedures to confiscate $116 million and several million
French francs in local and foreign bank accounts held by Aoun and
his aides.
   Aoun took refuge at the French Embassy on Oct. 13 and France has
granted him asylum.
   But the government has said he will not be allowed to leave
before he faces trial on a variety of charges, including the
alleged theft of $75 million of state funds.

<HEAD>Supporter Makes Appeal on Behalf of Ex-Guatemalan Dictator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supporter of retired Gen. Efrain Rios
Montt has lodged a last-ditch appeal to block Sunday's presidential
election because the former dictator is barred from running, an
official said Wednesday.
   Rios Montt was banned by the courts because the constitution
bars candidates who previously took power by force. The latest
appeal is given little chance of success.
   Prior to the ban, polls showed Rios Montt as the leading
candidate for president, winning support among voters tired of
corruption and crime.
   The director-general of voter registration, Felix Castillo
Milla, said he has passed the petition for nullification to the
Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The tribunal has three days to act on
the petition, which was filed by Francisco Fuentes Parra, a
legislative candidate who supports Rios Montt.
   President Vinicio Cerezo, who finishes his five-year term Jan.
14, is the first civilian elected president in 17 years in this
country shaken by a leftist guerrilla insurrection for the past
three decades.
   Rios Montt headed a military junta that overthrew President
Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, an army general elected as president
in March 1982. The military forced Rios Montt out of power in
August 1983.
   Rios Montt has accused Cerezo of planning to fix the elections
in favor Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the presidential nominee of
Cerezo's centrist Christian Democrats.
   
   Rios Montt claims he was robbed of victory when he ran for
president on the Christian Democratic ticket in 1974, with the
election fixed to put conservative Gen. Eugenio Kjell Laugerud in
power.
   The former dictator has now broken with the Christian Democrats.
He has been trying to run at the head of a ticket by a three-party
conservative coalition.

<HEAD>Engler Says Narrow Win Still a Mandate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov.-elect John Engler said Wednesday that he
defeated Democratic incumbent James Blanchard because Michigan
voters wanted property tax cuts and better schools.
   ``That's what winning is all about. Winning is the mandate,''
Engler said of his 19,134-vote upset of Blanchard. ``The taxpayers
have spoken out. They want more of a tax break and parents want
better schools for their kids.''
   The victory made Engler, the state Senate majority leader, the
first challenger in 28 years to bounce out an incumbent Michigan
governor. It returned the governor's office to GOP hands after
Blanchard's two terms of Democratic rule.
   Final unofficial returns showed Engler with 1,279,745 votes to
1,260,611 for Blanchard.
   Blanchard delayed his concession until 19 hours after the polls
closed, saying he wanted to double-check the vote tallies.
   But at a brief appearance at the Capitol in Lansing, Blanchard
said it appeared Engler's slim margin would hold up. He offered his
congratulations and said he accepted the voters' decision.
   ``The job of being governor is a great challenge, a great
responsiblity. anything I can do to make the transition smoother I
will do,'' Blanchard said.
   The final margin was the smallest since the 8,618 margin of the
1952 gubernatorial contest.
   In the Senate race, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting,
Democratic incumbent Carl Levin defeated Republican challenger Bill
Schuette by a 58-to-42 percent margin.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Army transport helicopter carrying
three crewmen crashed Wednesday night in the sea between Corinth
and Athens, officials said. No survivors were found.
   A spokesman for the Athens Region Control Center that monitors
Greek air traffic said the UH-1 Huey helicopter vanished from radar
screens at 6:20 p.m. in the Saronic Gulf near Corinth, about 47
miles west of Athens.
   An officer of the Isthmia port police said rescue vessels found
wreckage near the islet of Evreos in the Saronic Gulf.
   ``They found fragments, but there are no signs of survivors,''
he said by telephone, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The helicopter was based at Hellenikon U.S. Air Force base near
Athens, the traffic control spokesman said, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Two Army warrant officers and a sergeant were on board the
aircraft, the Pentagon in Washington said.
   The copter was enroute to Athens from Spain when it crashed, the
Pentagon said.
   The semi-official Athens News Agency, however, quoted unnamed
Greek military sources as saying the helicopter was flying in from
Italy when a malfunction forced it to land at the island of Othoni,
just north of Corfu.
   The helicopter's mechanic repaired the malfunction and the
helicopter refueled at Corfu before departing for Athens, military
sources said.

   Aides to Sen. Jesse Helms said Wednesday
that the incumbent's victory showed that he represents North
Carolina's conservative values.
   For his part, defeated Democrat Harvey Gantt said he may have
underestimated the impact race would have in the election.
   ``I think that it just shows ... that the people in this state
are traditional conservatives and that Sen. Helms represents their
traditional family values,'' said Helms' spokeswoman Beth Burrus.
``I think with the strong voter turnout, you can definitely say
that the people in this state want Sen. Helms representing them.
   ``It was a classic campaign between a conservative and a
liberal. The turnout (which topped 60 percent) gave you a true
picture of what North Carolina wanted.''
   Gantt, who's black and a former Charlotte mayor, said he knew
that race would be a factor but did not realize it would be such a
key factor.
   ``We have always factored in the fact that race would probably
play a role in this election ... we obviously may have
miscalculated on how much it would play a role,'' Gantt said at a
news conference in Charlotte.
   He said he had pledged not to raise race as an issue. ``And we
didn't. Sen. Helms did,'' he said.
   State Republican Party Chairman Jack Hawke said late polls and
the late adjournment of Congress that gave Helms only eight days of
full-time campaignin helped fire up the Helms forces.
   ``All we heard out in our areas was that Helms couldn't be
beat,'' Hawke said. ``People would want to know why we were so
worried because Helms was going to win.
   ``But then there was that late poll that showed Helms behind by
8 percent, and all of a sudden people were calling us asking what
they could do,'' Hawke said. ``And just about the time people were
starting to get interested, Helms came back from Washington and got
our people stirred up.''
   State Democratic Party Chairman Lawrence Davis said the Gantt
campaign, despite the loss, had helped pull together factions
within the party.
   ``I think we're more unified today than we've been in a long
while,'' Davis said. ``People are disappointed, to be sure, but you
don't have the bickering we had after 1988 when groups were
pointing fingers at each other.''
   Gantt's 48 percent share of the vote was the same as former Gov.
Jim Hunt, who lost to Helms in 1984. On Tuesday, Helms garnered
1,080,208 votes to 974,701 for Gantt.
   In the end, Hawke said, voters saw the Senate race in
conservative and liberal terms.
   ``I think if Gantt had been a little more of a moderate, Helms
would have been in real trouble,'' Hawke said. ``But the choice was
between two people who were at opposite ends of the spectrum.''

<TEXT>
   Black nationalist Nelson Mandela on Wednesday
accused the West of hypocrisy and prejudice in responding to
Kuwait's occupation, saying Iraq is being singled out because its
people are ``brown-skinned.''
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, said
Western governments had made no objections when U.S. forces invaded
Grenada or Panama and had tolerated the Israeli occupation of Arab
territory.
   ``But now, the whole of the West is screaming and sending
armies'' because of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Mandela said.
   He emphasized that he did not condone Iraq's actions and
expressed hope the confrontation could be solved peacefully.
   Mandela, however, suggested that Iraq was being treated
differently because its people were ``brown-skinned.''
   During his international tours to raise support for his
organization, Mandela has generally avoided comments apt to stir
controversy on matters unrelated to his anti-apartheid struggle.
   However, while in the United States earlier this year, he
praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro for his support and expressed
approval for Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The comments upset many Americans.
   In Paris on Wednesday, Mandela also said he had received a
positive response from President Francois Mitterrand to his request
that France help finance housing, jobs and education for ANC
members and their families as they resume their lives in South
Africa after exile or imprisonment. The ANC is the leading South
African group opposing the white-led government of that country.
   Mandela conferred for 40 minutes with Mitterrand at the close of
a three-week trip to Asia and Europe.
   Speaking to reporters after the talks, he declined to single out
France for criticism in regard to the Persian Gulf crisis. But he
said: ``We reject the hypocrisy of the West.''
   France has deployed 13,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf region
as part of the multinational force. More than 25 countries,
including the United States, have sent troops there to counter
Iraq.
   Mandela said he is not worried that South Africa might be pushed
out of the world spotlight because of the crisis and the gradual
dismantling of apartheid, South African's system of racial
separation.
   He said the leaders he met during his trip responded positively
to his appeal for aid, although he declined to give details.
   He also declined to comment on the government's handling of the
criminal case against his wife, Winnie. She faces charges in
connection with the abduction and killing of a teen-age black
activist.
   ``I am convinced of my wife's innocence, and I welcome the
charges,'' Mandela said. ``For the first time, she will have a
chance to defend herself.''
   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, reiterated
his position that economic sanctions against South Africa should
remain in effect, despite the numerous reforms by President F.W. de
Klerk. Mandela said the international sanctions should end only
when the last vestiges of apartheid are gone and the black majority
has full voting rights.
   The ANC and other opposition groups are now negotiating with the
government to give majority blacks a say in the country's political
system.

   Hundreds of supporters of slain Rabbi Meir
Kahane rampaged through Jerusalem on Wednesday, shouting ``Death to
Arabs!'' as the anti-Arab crusader was buried.
   Kahane, 58, was shot to death Monday by an Arab-American in New
York.
   The rioters attacked Arabs, smashed shop windows and clashed
with police after breaking away from a funeral procession of
thousands of Israelis, some of whom toted assault guns.
   Police reported four Palestinians and two policemen were
injured, and hospital officials said two of the Arab victims were
stabbed. Israel radio said many more Arabs were injured in
beatings. Jerusalem police said they arrested 13 rioters.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed for restraint, saying in
a statement on Israel radio that ``those harming security and
public order first of all harm Israel and assist our enemies.''
   Near the Givat Shaul cemetery where Kahane was buried, a
civilian and two soldiers tried to help an Arab who lay
unconscious. A crowd of Kahane supporters shouted: ``He's dead,
he's dead, the dirty Arab is dead!''
   As the stricken man showed signs of life, the crowd tried to
hold back an ambulance. Police forced them back.
   While Israeli politicians of every stripe condemned Kahane's
murder, a debate in Parliament still brought out mixed emotions
over the Brooklyn-born rabbi who espoused violence and the mass
expulsion of Arabs from territories ruled by Israel.
   The establishment shunned him for his extreme anti-Arab views,
but a chief rabbi and two Cabinet ministers came to the funeral.
The Parliament that had outlawed him as a racist stood in silence
for him on Tuesday.
   Both officials and newspaper editorials warned Kahane's murder
could worsen violence between Jews and Arabs.
   ``This is the danger engulfing us now - that Kahane's murder
will spark a dizzying cycle of further murders,'' the daily Yedioth
Ahronoth wrote.
   ``The fear is that this act of murder will intensify the racist
tendencies of our two people,'' Police Minister Roni Milo said.
   But he added a warning: ``The state of Israel, as a democratic
state, will defend its citizens and will cut off the hand of those
who wish them ill.''
   Police brought in hundreds of reinforcements to prevent
violence, but supporters of Kahane's anti-Arab Kach faction ran
though the streets attacking Palestinian passers-by and shops
employing Arab workers.
   The angry Kach followers also stoned an Israeli television crew,
beat the reporter with the crew, and tried to invade Israel TV
headquarters. Hadassah Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said one
policeman was hit on the head with a stone and the other was
knocked off his horse.
   One Arab ran through a shopping mall chased by several Kach
loyalists who shouted ``Death to terrorists!'' A shopkeeper gave
him refuge and police rescued him.
   Kahane, who led the militant Jewish Defense League in New York,
immigrated to Israel in 1971 and later founded Kach to spread his
call for expelling all 2.5 million Palestinians from Israel and the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He openly encouraged his supporters to retaliate for attacks on
Jews by assaulting Arabs at random.
   Police said more than 15,000 Israelis took part in the
procession or the funeral at a yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, run by
the Kach faction. Men in the black hats of Orthodox Jews mixed with
Kach men wearing the movement's yellow T-shirt.
   Frenzied followers waited outside the yeshiva, shouting ``Meir,
Meir!'' as the rabbi's coffin arrived after a flight from New York.
Thousands of American Jews attended a memorial to Kahane on Tuesday
in New York.
   At the Jerusalem funeral, Kach activist Yekutiel Ben-Yaakov
echoed the vow of revenge voiced by Kahane's supporters since his
death.
   ``We will let our friend the submachine gun talk for us. We will
let our friend the knife talk for us,'' Ben-Yaakov told the
thousands jammed in the streets around the yeshiva.
   The procession took three hours to wind along a major boulevard
to the municipal cemetery.
   Marchers carried blue-and-white Israeli flags and yellow banners
emblazoned with the Kach symbol of a clenched fist set in the
Jewish Star of David. Some supporters waved signs saying
``Transfer,'' a euphemism for Kahane's call to expel the
Palestinians.
   Science Minister Yuval Neeman and Absorption Minister Rabbi
Yitzhak Peretz came to the funeral, along with Israel's chief
Sephardic rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu.
   In his eulogy, Eliahu appealed to the mourners to leave
vengeance to God.
   Neeman, an ultra-rightist, was turned away amid shouts of
``leftist, leftist!'' He told Israel's army radio he had come to
represent Shamir's government.
   ``I meant to eulogize Rabbi Meir Kahane, may God avenge his
blood,'' Neeman said, using a traditional Jewish phrase in cases of
violent death.
   In Parliament, conservative lawmaker Hanan Porat of the National
Religious Party recalled that it was traditional to refer to the
dead as holy.
   ``All the same,'' he added, ``I confess that it is not easy for
me to talk about Rabbi Meir Kahane, of blessed memory, as holy.
That's not easy for me.''

<HEAD>Goddard, Symington Battle For Governorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Fife Symington nursed a tiny lead over
Democrat Terry Goddard early today in a nip-and-tuck race for
governor but the margin was so thin that a recount - and a runoff -
are likely.
   Symington hoped for an outright victory.
   ``Frankly, I think we're going to do it but it's not sewed up
right now,'' he told supporters at 3:30 a.m. ``I think it would be
in everyone's best interest if we went to bed.''
   Goddard gave his troops a similar message.
   With all but six of 1,958 precincts reporting, Symington led
Goddard by 3,589 votes out of more than 1.03 million counted.
   More than 10,000 votes went to seven write-in candidates,
including Max Hawkins, a former aide to impeached Gov. Evan Mecham
aide. Hawkins entered the race after the primary, saying he wanted
to offer an anti-abortion alternative.
   Some of the uncounted precincts were from rural counties where
Goddard was running ahead of Symington. And an estimated 300
ballots were reported missing from a Phoenix precinct considered
Goddard territory.
   Hundreds or thousands of absentee ballots remained to be
counted.
   Even if Symington's lead held up, it appeared to be too little
to forestall a runoff mandated by the state constitution for
elections in which no candidate gets an absolute majority.
   Goddard, a former Phoenix mayor, had been heavily. But
Symington, a millionaire Phoenix developer, spent almost twice as
much as Goddard. And the state has 91,000 more registered
Republicans than Democrats.
   The Legislature has never passed laws to implement a runoff and
elections officials estimate it could take months before one could
be held.
   The state's sitting governor, Rose Mofford, is supposed to leave
office in early January, but would likely stay on if a runoff is
required.
   Mofford, who succeeded Meacham after he was impeached.
   Neither of Arizona's two U.S. senators was up for re-election,
and none of the state's congressmen faced more than token
opposition.
   Symington and Goddard, both Harvard graduates from prominent
families, shared pro-choice stands on abortion and supported a
Martin Luther King state holiday, which voters rejected Tuesday.
   Symington, 45, complained that Goddard raised city taxes and
fees as mayor. Goddard pointed to Symington's directorships of two
savings and loans that later failed and suggested in television
commercials that Symington's development company was in financial
trouble.

   Several activist groups united
Wednesday as a nationwide opposition movement and warned of a
possible comeback by former Communist rulers.
   In a statement covering the front page of the mass-circulation
daily Romania Libera, the Civic Alliance said the Communist Party
was recovering from last year's revolution that drove it from
power.
   One Alliance source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the coalition intended to begin a nationwide investigation to
determine the exact role of former Communists in the governing
National Salvation Front. He gave no further details.
   The Front took power during December's revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It then won a landslide
victory in May elections and controls about two-thirds of the seats
in Parliament. Its leader, Ion Iliescu, became Romania's president.
   Opposition groups have accused Iliescu, a former Ceausescu
minister, of maintaining old totalitarian structures under a
different name and of secretly holding Communist beliefs. Iliescu
has repeatedly denied the charges.
   Ludovic Tarca of the Timisoara Society, one group in the
Alliance, said the new coalition would ``breathe new life into the
civil opposition.''
   ``We want not power itself, but to keep those in power in check,
whatever their party, and correct their mistaken policies,'' Tarca
said.
   Other members said the group might become a political party in
the future.
   The new Civic Alliance includes the intellectual Group for
Social Dialogue, the Timisoara Society, the Nov. 15 group from the
central city of Brasov and other non-parliamentary groups.
   Its membership also lists well-known opposition figures, such as
Bucharest Student League President Marian Munteanu and former
dissident writer Ana Blandiana.
   The Timisoara Society - named after the Western city where the
December revolution began - has demanded that former high-ranking
Communists be banned from public office.
   Union leaders have also mounted a series of strikes in recent
months to demand the ouster of former Communists. They say the
ex-Communists have retained power in the bureaucracy and impeded
reforms.

   Conflicting stories emerged Wednesday about El
Sayyid Nosair as the alleged assassin of radical Rabbi Meir Kahane
began to recuperate from a bullet in the neck.
   Nosair, whose condition improved from serious to fair Wednesday,
was described by many acquaintances as a man who kept to himself.
But New York Newsday reported one former employer fired him partly
because his efforts to convert fellow workers to Islam interfered
with his work.
   Nosair, 34, of Cliffside Park, N.J., was shot by a U.S. postal
police officer after he allegedly killed Kahane, an anti-Arab,
ultraright-wing Zionist, Monday night.
   Nosair was charged with murder, attempted murder, assault,
unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon and of a
defaced weapon. The murder weapon, a .357 Magnum revolver, had its
identification numbers filed off.
   Newsday cited sources it did not identify as saying Nosair had
no arrest record and neither the FBI nor the CIA had heard of him
before Kahane was shot.
   Tuesday, FBI agents and police removed a file cabinet, several
boxes and a target drawn on white plasterboard from Nosair's home.
   Records in this country showed Nosair was born in Port Said,
Egypt, on Nov. 16, 1955, and graduated from a college in Cairo,
where he studied industrial engineering.
   However, Gen. Ahmed Zaatar, an assistant to the interior
minister of Egypt, said Wednesday that government records in Port
Said showed no record of a man born there with that name, or
spellings close to it.
   Immigration records indicate Nosair entered the United States
through New York on a visitor's visa July 14, 1981; married a U.S.
citizen, Caren Ann Mills, in 1982; became a permanent resident of
Pittsburgh in 1983 and became a naturalized citizen in September
1989.
   The New York Post said Nosair met the woman he married at a
Pittsburgh mosque. Newsday said they met while taking night classes
at a university there.
   Nosair's first job in Pittsburgh was as a diamond setter at St.
Clair's Jewelers.
   ``He came here as a very naive, very nice young man from a
foreign country,'' said Barbara Ausman, his supervisor. ``And he
had a very high opinion of himself.''
   His goal, she told Newsday, was to get rich and return to Egypt.
   Ausman said Nosair had tremendous national pride as an Egyptian
and seemed reluctant to adjust to American customs.
   Ausman said Nosair was fired from the jewelry store in 1983.
   ``We dismissed him for two reasons: in part because of his lack
of ability to develop his skills,'' she said. ``But also because he
would consistently try to convert people to his way of religion.''
   In 1986, Nosair moved to Jersey City, N.J.
   Debra Ragab, 39, superintendent of a Jersey City apartment
complex where the family had lived, said the murder charge was ``a
surprise to us, to everybody,'' including Mrs. Nosair.
   The Nosairs moved to Cliffside Park about a year ago with their
daughter, Nora, 11, and two sons, Abdul Aziz, 7, and Abdul Rahman,
5.
   Nosair used a relative's New York City address, however, to
obtain a city job in April 1988 as a heating and air conditioning
repairman.

<TEXT>
   The political ghost of impeached Gov. Evan Mecham
is haunting Arizona politics again, forcing a gubernatorial runoff
between Republican Fife Symington and Democrat Terry Goddard.
   The problem is that no one knows how or when to hold the runoff
because the law requiring one doesn't deal with the specifics.
   As a result, officials say, Gov. Rose Mofford will have to stay
on as a caretaker after her term expires in January. Mrs. Mofford,
the secretary of state, was elevated to the governor's office when
Mecham was impeached and ousted two years ago. She did not seek a
term of her own.
   Mecham lost out in the GOP primary in a comeback bid.
   Arizona voters also defeated two ballot measures that attempted
to create a paid holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
   In the governor's race, Symington, a millionaire developer, led
Goddard, a former Phoenix mayor, by 4,296 votes. With all but one
precinct reporting, Symington had 522,320 votes and Goddard had
518,024.
   But with more than 11,300 write-in votes for seven minor
candidates, Symington won't have more than 50 percent of the votes
cast, as needed.
   The requirement, inspired by Mecham's 1986 win in a three-way
race and added to the state constitution in 1988, forces a runoff
between the two top vote-getters unless on candidate gets an
absolute majority.
   Officials have to resolve about 5,200 questioned ballots and
finish tabulating the write-ins before they can issue an official
statement, but Assistant Secretary of State Karen Osborne said a
runoff is likely.
   ``The figures all point to that,'' Secretary of State Jim
Shumway agreed.
   Political leaders, meanwhile, huddled over a possible special
session to write laws for a runoff.
   Among the questions is whether an annual January purge of voting
roles would disenfranchise would-be voters and whether those who
registered too late for Tuesday's election should be allowed to
vote in the runoff.
   There are logistical problems as well.
   Because of past complaints involving minority voters, changes in
Arizona voting laws must be reviewed by the U.S. Justice
Department.
   One of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday plans went down by a
3-1 margin, as expected. The other, expected to win narrowly, lost
by about 11,000 votes. Observers attributed the defeat to the
possibility that the National Football League would move the 1993
Super Bowl from Arizona if the measure failed.
   ``They tried to leverage the public and that just won't work,''
said Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson.

<HEAD>Former Vermont Gov. Wins Back Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Richard Snelling will get the
chance to do things his way again when he takes back his old office
in January.
   Despite leaving office while the state faced a $35 million
deficit, Snelling campaigned on the theme that his successor,
Democratic Gov. Madeleine Kunin, had mismanaged the state's
finances. Snelling, a Republican, was governor from 1977-84.
   With all precincts reporting, Snelling had 109,195 votes, or 52
percent; Democrat Peter Welch, a former state senator, had 97,101
votes, or 46 percent. Kunin did not seek a fourth two-year term.
   Snelling is assuming the helm of a state struggling with a
sagging economy, which he says is in recession. He predicted he
will have to work with the Legislature to bail the state out of a
pending deficit that could climb higher than $20 million this
fiscal year.
   But he sets about the task armed with a successful business
resume.
   Snelling, 63, was born in Allentown, Pa., one of nine children
who learned about politics from their father, a scientist.
   ``Every major political event during my childhood was debated at
the family table,'' Snelling recalled recently. ``Can you imagine
nine kiddies around the table with a guy with two (doctorates) at
the head of the table saying, `Why did you say that? What's the
proof of that?'''
   He received a degree in government and economics from Harvard
University in 1948. After leaving Harvard, Snelling bought a
bankrupt Philadelphia seed and garden supply company with his life
savings of $10,000. Two years later, the company went bankrupt
again.
   But he went on to make millions after founding Shelburne
Industries, a ski equipment and power tool company, in 1958. His
children now control the company.
   That same year he entered the Vermont Legislature, where he
served for two more terms in the mid-1970s and rose to become
majority leader of the Vermont House.
   In 1966, Snelling ran for governor against Democrat Philip Hoff
and lost by about 21,000 votes. He went on to win the post 10 years
later and held onto the job until stepping down in 1984.
   Snelling returned briefly to the public scene in 1986, running
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt. He lost by more than 56,000 votes.
   Referring to his political losses, Snelling said, ``In both
cases, what I told myself was that it would be nice to win, but the
civic duty was being the champion of a point of view. When I
started running 1{ years ago, it was a similar thing.''
   Snelling has said that as governor, he plans to work to create
more jobs in the state, revamp education funding to provide
poperty tax relief and control state spending.

<HEAD>VRS, Joint Venture on Exit Polls and Projection, Works - With A
Hitch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new joint venture by the four networks for
exit polls and projections got its trial by fire on election night
and proved again an ancient political adage: You win some, you lose
some.
   ``We made projections in 80 to 85 races last night,'' Warren
Mitofsky, executive director of the Voter Research and Surveys
project, or VRS, said Wednesday.
   ``On calls, we were outstanding. I've never made that many close
calls in one night. I've never had to,'' said Mitofsky, who headed
CBS' election unit for more than 20 years.
   But a national exit poll, a kind of snapshot of the electorate
and its attitudes which other news organizations bought from VRS,
wasn't distributed because of technical difficulties.
   ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN each have paid $3 million for exit polls
and projections through 1992 in all Senate, House and governor's
races, as well as some state and local races of national interest.
   Tuesday night, VRS called 67 Senate and governor's races.
   CNN, which previously had never had fast access to exit poll
results, ``was pleased with the output of VRS in making state race
calls and, by and large, with the state race analysis,'' said Tom
Hannon, CNN's elections unit chief and a board member of VRS.
   The national exit poll of voter attitudes, a component of the
House races' exit poll, wasn't finished in time for Wednesday's
editions of The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today,
the only newspapers which bought it.
   There were 14 newspaper among about 60 non-member news
organizations which bought state poll results from VRS, the
cooperative said.
   Mitofsky said the national poll delay stemmed from the
``weighting'' of data to reflect national proportions.
   ``In other words,'' Mitofsky said, ``if the Northeast is a
fourth of the nation, you want the Northeast to be a fourth of the
poll. And you can follow that down to the precinct level.
   ``In applying that weighting, we ran into some computer
programmng errors,'' he said. ``The poll could have been used
without weights at all, but we didn't think that was the best use
of the data.''
   The poll was released to the three newspapers in time for
Thursday's editions, VRS officials said.
   Mitofsky and other VRS officials said time constraints
contributed to VRS' problems.
   VRS was conceived as a cost-saving cooperative venture between
competitors, and negotiations to establish it began after the 1988
elections but concluded only in February of this year.
   ``We did this whole project in five months less than I told
everybody we needed to do it,'' Mitofsky said. ``I think the fact
that we got a late start needs to be weighed into that equation.''

<TEXT>
   The test of an American cruise missile
over northwestern Canada was aborted in midflight Wednesday because
of technical malfunctions, officials said.
   Maj. Luigi Rossetto of the Canadian forces base at Cold Lake
said the test was canceled because of technical problems between
the cruise missile's guidance system - which was being tested - and
the B-52 carrying the weapon.
   The B-52 returned to base, K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in the
upper peninsula of Michigan, where the missile's guidance system
will be examined.
   Rossetto said no further tests on the missile were planned, but
that more may be held in the spring on other cruise missiles.
   The tests are permitted under a Canada-U.S. agreement signed in
1983 and renewed in 1988. They have drawn protests from peace
groups and the Northwest Territories government, and a
demonstration was held Wednesday at the Alberta legislature in
Edmonton.
   Military officials say the Canadian North is ideal for the tests
because the terrain is similar to that of the Soviet Union.
   A simulated launch sequence began about 12:30 a.m. EST when the
B-52 bomber carrying the missile reached the Beaufort Sea, 1,360
miles northwest of Edmonton.
   The flight path turned south from the Beaufort along the
Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta, where the test was terminated
about 3:30 p.m. EST.
   The test was originally scheduled for Oct. 30, but was postponed
five times because of technical problems and poor weather.

   Sen. Bill Bradley said Wednesday that
his narrow victory reflected voters' anger at higher state taxes
and a campaign that failed to talk about people's main concerns.
   ``You're in this job, you're in the line of fire,'' he said.
``In good times you ride, in bad times you take the hit. I offer no
excuses at all.''
   Bradley defeated Republican Christine Todd Whitman by slightly
more than 50,000 of the2 million votes cast in the race. But the
two-term senator said he would have done nothing differently and
refused to discuss the $2.8 billion tax package imposed by Gov. Jim
Florio that fueled the anger.
   ``I sensed no deep-seated attack on me for something I had done.
Maybe it's for what I needed to do,'' Bradley said the day after he
defeated Mrs. Whitman with 50 percent of the vote to her 47
percent.
   She made the principal issue of her campaign Bradley's refusal
to comment on Florio's tax plan.
   ``What people want is for politicians to talk about problems
that really affect people's lives,'' Bradley said, like finding
quality education and coping with housing, health care and fuel
costs. ``I think the campaign generally on both sides did not
engage those issues.''
   ``My sense is that the senator didn't take his constituents
seriously,'' said Richard Roper, director of the Council on New
Jersey Affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.
``I'm suggesting his agenda should have had a bit more depth in
view of his years in the Senate.''
   Overall, though, Roper discounted the effect of the campaign on
Bradley's long-term political prospects, including the presidency.
   Bradley repeated Wednesday that he was firm about completing his
six-year term.
   ``I don't think that the public cares a great deal about
re-election margins,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington.
   She cited the example of Gary Hart's slim 1980 Senate victory.
``In the 1984 New Hampshire primary, I didn't hear a lot of voters
saying he barely squeaked through in Colorado,'' she said.
   Michael Kaye, Bradley's California-based media consultant,
predicted that Bradley's near-miss would quickly be forgotten.
   ``He's not a candidate in '92,'' Kaye said. ``And if he becomes
a candidate at a later date, they sure won't go back six years and
replay what happened in his race in 1990.''
   Kaye said the campaign may have failed by emphasizing Bradley's
record on the environment and children.
   ``It was not pertinent to what people were feeling and what
their anger was,'' Kaye said.
   Mrs. Whitman, speaking at a Statehouse news conference, accused
Bradley of ``not talking to the issues voters wanted to hear.''
   Kaye said Bradley's advisers made an early decision not to
comment on state taxes and even when they realized that position
was hurting them, they didn't budge.
   ``We felt either way it was a loser,'' Kaye said.
   On the stump, Bradley tried to reassure voters about what he was
doing in Washington on their behalf. But he admitted he might not
have been able to convey on a broader scale that he had their
problems at heart.

<HEAD>Congress Rejects Trial for Peru's Garcia in Prison Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress narrowly voted Wednesday not to bring
criminal charges against former President Alan Garcia for his role
in the 1986 massacre of 250 rebel prisoners.
   After two days of often bitter debate, the Chamber of Deputies
voted 80-75 not to try Garcia, who left office on July 28. More
than 80 congressmen spoke during the session.
   The case involves the bloody repression of riots at three
maximum-security Lima prisons.
   Police and soldiers who put down the June 1986 riots killed 250
prisoners, mostly members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla
group. An investigation later found that many of the prisoners
apparently were executed after they surrendered.
   The votes in support of Garcia came mainly from his own
center-left Aprista Party, which controls 55 seats in the 180-seat
Chamber. Most other votes came from members of President Alberto
Fujimori's Change 90 party.
   Garcia could have faced jail if brought to trial on charges
involving the massacre. As a senator and former president he cannot
be prosecuted in a criminal court, but he earlier offered to waive
his immunity if Congress voted in favor of a trial.
   A minority report issued after a Senate investigation in 1987
blamed Garcia and his Cabinet for the killings.
   The report said Garcia's decision to cede control of the
situation to the military led to the massacre.
   After Garcia left office, Congress began a new investigation of
Garcia's role in the massacre.
   He has said repeatedly the investigation was aimed at damaging
him politically.
   He is still under investigation by a second congressional
committee for the possible misuse of public funds while in office.
   Many congressmen of Fujimori's Change 90 party had been expected
to support Garcia in the vote. Party members earlier voted to pay
debts left by Garcia's government.
   Though strongly opposed to Fujimori's economic policies, the
Apristas have mounted almost no effective opposition since he came
to power July 28.
   Only 36 years old when he took office in 1985, Garcia was the
youngest president in Peruvian history.
   The constitution bars presidents from holding office for two
straight terms, but Garcia is an early favorite to be elected again
in 1995.
   However, he would be prohibited from running again under a bill
introduced in the Senate on Tuesday to limit presidents to one term
in office.

   Richard Berendzen, who resigned as president

   The Washington Post said the settlement was authorized by the

saying ``the university as a policy does not discuss financial
arrangements between the university and its employees. That's the
same with the president or a secretary.''
   She said, however, that ``as of January, there will be no
relationship between the university and Richard Berendzen.'' The
university's executive committee met in closed session on Friday.
   Sources confirmed the $1 million sum was ``in the ballpark.''
   Berendzen last April resigned the presidency of the Washington
university he had held for 10 years and has not been actively
involved in administrative affairs. But he continued to hold
tenure. His salary had been about $140,000 a year.
   Susan Allen of Fairfax, Va., told police that Berendzen's calls
began in March after she placed an advertisement for home child
care in the Post. She said Berendzen graphically discussed
fantasized sexual relations with children.
   Police traced the calls to the university president's office.
Berendzen entered the sexual disorders clinic at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore and later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor
counts and was placed on probation.
   The hospital said in a statement that ``the phone calls appeared
to have been a troubled attempt to make sense'' out of sexual abuse
Berendzen suffered as a child. It said Berendzen ``is not a
pedophile and has no pedophilic interests. He does not have a
sexual disorder.''
   Berendzen characterized the calls as ``inappropriate and
grotesque'' and apologized to Ms. Allen. She has filed suit, asking
$4 million from Berendzen and $7 million from the university.
   Richard Marks, Berendzen's attorney, said the account of the
settlement with the university ``contains material inaccuracies,''
but he declined to say what they were.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to confirm or deny speculation
as it appears in the media,'' Marks said.

<HEAD>Minnesota's Wellstone Promises to Press Liberal Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota's new senator-elect said
Wednesday he'll press his liberal agenda with the same ``fast-paced
Paul'' style that produced his stunning upset of two-term
Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.
   ``I go to Washington with a pretty strong belief that things
need to be changed, that things need to be shaken up,'' said Paul
Wellstone, a Democrat.
   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich was also bounced out of office,
losing to Republican Arne Carlson, the state auditor who campaigned
just two weeks. Carlson, 52, replaced the party's nominee who was
driven from the race by allegations of sexual improprieties.
   Wellstone, 46, a political science professor, captivated
Minnesota voters with his infectious enthusiasm and a campaign run
by a covey of young volunteers, who Boschwitz credited with the
race's dramatic turnaround. Republicans once considered Boschwitz's
seat one of their safest.
   ``I thought he was going to be re-elected and I thought he was
going to be re-elected by more than a squeaker,'' said Republican
U.S. Rep. Bill Frenzel, who's retiring after serving Minnesota's
3rd District for 20 years.
   Wellstone got 52 percent of the vote Tuesday to Boschwitz's 48
percent with 99 percent of the state's precincts reporting.
Wellstone had 881,712 votes to Boschwitz's 828,432.
   ``My opponent ran a very aggressive and capable and resourceful
campaign,'' Boschwitz said Wednesday when he conceded the race.
``He outhustled us.''
   The GOP campaign also suffered from intraparty turmoil in the
Independent-Republican gubernatorial race, Boschwitz said.
   The governor's race was rated by many observers as the most
negative ever in Minnesota.
   Perpich was roundly criticized for publicizing divorce disputes
of his first GOP opponent, Jon Grunseth. Before Grunseth dropped
out of the race nine days prior to the election, he accused Perpich
of orchestrating allegations about skinny-dipping with teen-age
girls that drove him out.
   Perpich, governor for 10 years, declined to analyze why he lost.
   ``It's behind me,'' he said. ``We gave it all we could. We
worked very, very hard. It happens. Who knows why? This is not an
exact science.''
   Boschwitz outspent Wellstone 7-1, but the liberal activist
crisscrossed the state for months in a ramshackle bus and captured
the attention of voters with funny television commercials that
brought him national attention.
   College students thronged to his cause. His youthful workers and
supporters rocked the Capitol rotunda Wednesday with chants of
``Senator Wellstone, Senator Wellstone'' when he arrived to claim
victory.
   ``Politics is indeed not about money ... but the improvement of
people's lives,'' Wellstone said. ``These guys pulled it off. These
guys did it.''
   He expects to be a very outspoken member of the Senate in the
mold of liberal gadfly Howard Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat.
Metzenbaum often irritates colleagues by blocking special interest
bills and relentlessly pursuing liberal causes.
   ``I intend to go there and move quickly. ... I intend to be a
fast-paced Paul,'' Wellstone said.
   Boschwitz, who celebrated his 60th birthday Wednesday, said
he'll return to Minnesota and go into some business other than the
Plywood Minnesota chain of home-improvement centers that made him a
millionaire before he entered the Senate in 1978. Plywood Minnesota
is run by his four sons and wife, Ellen.

   A lawyer for a winery worker
convicted of killing seven people condemned a prosecutor for
showing a jury Wednesday a naked, bloody photograph of one of the
victims.
   Prosecutor Peter Bumerts pinned the photo of the dead 8-year-old
girl to a board near the jury box during the penalty phase of Ramon
Salcido's trial.
   Bumerts apologized to the jury ``for the difficulty you have in
looking'' at it.
   One of Salcido's lawyers, Marteen Miller, decried the move as a
tactic to imply his client sexually assaulted the girl, which was
never proved.
   ``The very fact that there are seven victims, and one happens to
have her legs spread and her genitalia showing, that's going to the
depth of the barrel as far as I'm concerned,'' Miller said outside
of the courtroom. ``This is just a red herring.''
   Salcido, 29, was convicted Oct. 30 of killing his wife, two of
his three daughters, his mother-in-law, her two daughters and a
co-worker.
   He also was convicted of attempted murder, including slashing
his third daughter's throat, during a rampage April 14, 1989.
   The jury must now decide whether Salcido gets the death penalty
or life in prison without parole. The prosecution wants Salcido
sent to the gas chamber.
   The defense has flown Salcido's mother in from Mexico to testify
Thursday for sparing her son's life. While a jury typically might
not heed a killer's mother, in this case ``she lost her
grandchildren, whom she loved very much,'' defense attorney Bill
Marioni said.
   The defense also called a former warden to testify that a
convict such as Salcido could be held safely in prison, and a jail
guard, Kenton Dunkle, who testified Salcido was ``congenial'' and
``a good inmate.''
   The photo of the girl, Salcido's sister-in-law, was not shown
earlier in the trial.
   Bumerts said the photograph illustrated Salcido's callousness
because he removed the girl's underwear and wiped his knife on it
after slitting her throat.
   Outside the courtroom, Bumerts said the photo ``shows the
insensitivity to human life that Mr. Salcido had. I think the jury
needs to remember who the victims in this case were.''
   ``Nonsense, absolute nonsense,'' said Miller. ``If you believe
that, I'll sell you some ocean view property in Arizona.''
   Judge Reginald Littrell told the jury there was no finding of
sexual abuse in the case but allowed the photograph to be shown.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev soght political harmony by
joining a Revolution Day march Wednesday but the mood was broken
when a man brandishing a hunting rifle fired two shots in Red
Square before he was hauled off.
   A group of plainclothesmen wrestled with the gunman, who shot in
the air and into the ground before he was carried away. No one was
reported hurt, and the chairman of the KGB security police
indicated the man was deranged.
   Besides the traditional military parade in Red Square, hard-line
Communists and radical reformers marched in Moscow and other Soviet
cities shouting slogans and carrying banners critical of
Gorbachev's moderate reforms.
   Gorbachev, struggling to forge a mainstream consensus in an
increasingly polarized society, said his reforms were ``understood
and accepted by the people.''
   ``We all now stand a real chance to transform our society into a
normal, healthy, just and ulimately prosperous society through the
second great revolution,'' Gorbachev proclaimed from atop Lenin's
Mausoleum on the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   Gray skies and snow flurries cast a somber mood as the Soviet
armed forces sent 8,500 troops and 250 armored vehicles thundering
across the cobblestones of Red Square.
   For the first time, the Soviets showed off a mobile SS-25
intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hurling a nuclear
warhead 6,300 miles. The system has been deployed since 1985.
   The theme was peace, however, and Gorbachev joined his political
foes, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov, in leaving the mausoleum and joining a civilian march that
began after the military parade.
   It was the first time Soviet leaders actually walked in the
march, the state news agency Tass reported.
   The three men, along with Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov, Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and others laid red flowers at Lenin's
tomb.
   The mood was broken by the markedly conservative tone of the
subsequent civilian marchers consisting of an estimated 100,000
marchers organized by Moscow Communist Party chief Yuri Prokofiev.
   Some carried portraits of dictator Josef V. Stalin, whom
Gorbachev scorned in his remarks, and two carried photographs of
naked women, suggesting variously that current leaders had ravished
or neglected the country. Other banners said:
   ``President: In our house, there is no butter, no meat and no
peace.''
   ``Gorbachev, you are scoring points abroad, but losing at
home.''
   About four minutes after Gorbachev went back on top of the Lenin
mausoleum, two shots were heard above the marching music.
   Plainclothes police, hundreds of whom line Red Square during
such public events, apparently grabbed the man as he leveled a
sawed-off hunting rifle toward the mausoleum about 80 yards away,
according to Tass.
   One officer shoved the man's arms up as one shot went off, then
others swarmed around and forced the barrel toward the ground as
the second shot was fired, said Rafik Nishanov, a parliamentary
leader who was on the mausoleum.
   More than a dozen plainclothesmen surrounded the 38-year-old
Leningrad resident and carried him horizontal into the adjacent GUM
Department store, as seen in a tape released by the Tass video
unit.
   KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, asked at a Kremlin reception
whether the man was sane, replied: ``Not in our our opinion ... but
we are investigating.''
   The national evening television newscast ``Vremya'' broadcast
videotape of the man being taken off by plainclothes security.
   After the official demonstration, Yeltsin addressed about 10,000
protesters who gathered near Communist Party headquarters, marched
past the KGB and ended up near the home of the late physicist
Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel Peace laureate.
   Yeltsin and Popov also joined another more radical
counterdemonstration that entered Red Square two hours after
Gorbachev and other leaders left.
   Those demonstrators demanded Gorbachev resign.
   ``The country is on the verge of a civil war,'' said one of the
organizers, Telman Gdlyan. He also compared the government with a
``fascist'' regime. Tass said his remarks ``insulted the Soviet
president.''
   Official parades were held in other big cities, although
anti-Communists tried to ban or disrupt some of them.
   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, locally organized defense
units clashed with Soviet paratroopers who reportedly tried to
storm a conservatory in Vilnius, the independent Baltic News
Service reported.
   In neighboring Latvia, army troops were deployed to ``protect''
the official parade. In the third Baltic republic of Estonia, the
official parade was nearly ignored and no counterdemonstration was
held, the report said.
   Thousands packed Leningrad's Palace Square, where the 1917
revolution was centered, for a protest after the official parade.
   In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, the military parade proceeded
peacefully, said a visiting U.S. scholar. About 5,000 people met
later for an anti-Communist rally.
   In the Caucasian republic of Georgia, where non-Communists won
recent elections, the military parade was held on an army base.
   Officials canceled part of an official parade in Azerbaijan out
of fear it would turn into a protest, Tass reported.
   In Moldavia, where recent ethnic strife has left at least four
dead, the capital Kishinev was quiet with no parade. But in the
eastern region where Slavic separatists are opposed to Moldavian
nationalism, tens of thousands of people staged pro-government
rallies, Tass said.

   Andre Roussimoff, better known as
wrestler Andre the Giant, was fined $100 and ordered to pay $233 in
damages to a television station over a scuffle with a cameraman
last year.
   Roussimoff was found guilty of criminal mischief in a non-jury
trial. A judge fined the 7-foot-4, 540-pound wrestler Tuesday.
   Roussimoff was charged in a scrap with former KCRG-TV cameraman
Ben Hildebrandt, just after Roussimoff was defeated in a
professional wrestling match in Cedar Rapids.
   He contended Hildebrandt videotaped the match without
permission, but the cameraman said he was just shooting crowd
scenes when the wrestler put him in a head lock.
   Hildebrandt was treated for minor injuries and later left the
station to work on a congressional campaign.
   The judge found Roussimoff innocent of assault charges, saying
the wrestler didn't mean to harm Hildebrandt. The damages, to be
paid to KCRG, are to reimburse the station for fixing the camera.

<HEAD>Ousted Haitian President Wants Dec. 16 Elections Canceled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Former President Leslie Manigat,
who was ousted in a 1988 coup, said Wednesday he would sue
officials for barring him from running for the presidency. He also
said the Dec. 16 elections should be canceled.
   The country's Electoral Council on Tuesday disqualified Manigat
from running for president next month based on an article of the
constitution that says the president ``may not be re-elected''
unless five years have passed between terms.
   The council barred 11 other presidential hopefuls from the race,
including many officials of the oppressive Duvalier regime that
ruled this poor Caribbean nation for 29 years. Fourteen candidates
remain.
   In a statement read to the press, Manigat said the elections
should be declared ``null and void'' because he never resigned from
the presidency and he had not completed his term in office. He said
these factors made the constitutional article cited by the
Electoral Council inapplicable.
   Manigat was elected Jan. 17, 1988, in what are generally
considered army-rigged elections, held after a massacre at the
polls the previous November canceled the balloting.
   Most Haitians stayed home and did not vote in the January
elections, fearing for their lives. Although he was regarded a
puppet of the army, Manigat was ousted six months after taking
office and deported.
   A former history professor, he has lived in exile in the United
States until his return in October. The interim government of
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot tried several times to deny him
re-entry permission for ``reasons of state.''
   ``The injustice the council has committed will fall on its
head,'' said Manigat. He called for ``a vast national protest''
against the decision.
   Election officials said the 1987 constitution did not make
provisions for coups. Thus, the issue of Manigat's eligibility to
run for president is not completely clear.
   ``Manigat must accept that he is an ordinary citizen and conform
his desire to the reality of the electoral law,'' said human rights
activist Jean-Claude Bajeux, who co-leads a socialist party.
   Roger Lafontant, who was the head of brutal Tonton Macoute
militia that enforced the Duvalier rule for nearly three decades,
was also barred from running for president on technicalities under
the election law.
   He said Tuesday he would appeal the decision to the Supreme
Court.
   In 1987, the barring of Duvalierists led to the killing of 34
voters at the polls in the aborted election.
   Many Haitians worried the new disqualifications would provoke
the revenge of Duvalier supporters. But there have been no
incidents.
   There are 200 to 300 observers already in the country as part of
an international team from the United Nations and the Organization
of American States that is to monitor the elections.
   The Duvalier dictatorship ended when Jean-Claude Duvalier fled
to exile in France in 1986. But Haiti has continued to be plagued
by political violence.
   The current government is the fifth since Duvalier was deposed.

<HEAD>Amoco Pipeline Leaks More Oil Than Expected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crude oil that leaked from an Amoco pipeline
and fouled 35 miles of the Chariton River totaled 44,000 to 66,000
gallons, officials said in an estimate up sharply from earlier
figures.
   The oil may spread south another 20 miles, reaching the Missouri
River by Thursday, the state Department of Natural Resources warned
Wednesday. The Chariton River runs from Iowa to the Missouri River.
   Amoco Corp., which owns the pipeline, originally estimated that
Monday's oil leak sent 21,000 gallons into the river in
north-central Missouri, fouling about 10 to 15 miles.
   William Palmer, a spokesman for the state agency, said the
spill's effect, not its size, made it very significant.
   ``Each spill is different; the Chariton River is very low, which
concentrates the effect of the oil on wildlife,'' he said.
   The agency also advised cities that may have to shut off water
intakes because of the oil to immediately pump as much water into
reservoirs as possible.
   Dave Abshear, an Amoco spokesman, said oil company officials
believe there has been no damage to fish or wildlife.
   ``That's untrue,'' Palmer said. ``We have seen dead fish and
stressed fish coming to the surface and gasping for air. We're very
concerned about mammals and fur bearers and waterfowl migrating at
this time.''
   The Department of Conservation stocked the river with otters in
recent years. Several nearby state wildlife refuges attract
thousands of migrating waterfowl, and some of them pass over and
use the Chariton.
   Amoco work crews were on the scene of spill Wednesday with
vacuuming equipment. The company said the cleanup could take about
a month and Amoco would cover all costs.

   Two freight trains collided Wednesday,

   The Santa Fe Railway trains crashed about 4:10 a.m. A westbound
train left a siding too early and smashed into a passing eastbound
train, said Santa Fe spokesman Mike Martin.
   Four locomotives and at least six freight cars derailed. Diesel
fuel from a locomotive ignited but firefighters prevented the blaze
from spreading.
   The collision left Santa Fe's main transcontinental line blocked
until sometime Thursday, said police Sgt. Tim Slane.
   About 100 gallons of spilled diesel fuel was mopped up, but
removal of the wreckage could not begin until National
Transportation Safety Board investigators arrive from Washington,
Slane said.
   The wreck occurred in an area of light industry in Corona, a
city of 61,000 in Riverside County, about 45 miles east of Los
Angeles.

   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a leader in the
Christian unity movement, has become the first woman minister
nominated for chief executive of the National Council of Churches,
it was announced Wednesday.
   A search committee recommended the 58-year-old minister as the
new general secretary of the council, the country's largest
ecumenical organization. Founded 40 years ago, the council includes
most major U.S. Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations.
   The nomination goes before the council's general board at a
meeting Nov. 14-16 in Portland, Ore. While other nominees may be
offered from the floor, historically the search committee's choice
has won election.
   A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Ms. Campbell holds ministerial
credentials in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and
American Baptist Churches (U.S.A.).
   She is currently U.S. staff officer of the World Council of
Churches.
   Offering prayers for the ``vision and the spiritual strength''
to handle the new task, Ms. Campbell said, ``Never during the 20
years that I have worked within the ecumenical movement have I
sensed a time when unity was more urgent. We are a nation on the
brink of war, faced with increased racism and economic
insecurity.''
   She would succeed James A. Hamilton, a council staff member and
United Methodist layman who has been interim general secretary
since July 1, 1989.
   While Ms. Campbell would be the first woman minister in the
post, it was held between 1974 and 1984 by an ordained Presbyterian
elder, Claire Randall.

<TEXT>
   Gov.-elect Jim Edgar began taking the reins of
state government Wednesday, and Paul Simon said his own landslide
may turn some heads in the U.S. Senate, where liberalism has been
considered out of vogue.
   After his narrow victory over Democrat Neil Hartigan in
Tuesday's election, Republican Edgar said he would begin work on
cabinet appointments and other personnel decisions by naming a
transition team.
   Democrat Simon, who trounced Lynn Martin, a Republican
congresswoman, said: ``I think the margin of victory really does
say that someone who stands for the things that I stand for can win
and not just eke out a victory.''
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Simon had 2,076,358
votes, or 65 percent, and Martin had 1,120,717 votes, or 35
percent.
   ``It says something to my colleagues who are concerned about
whether they can vote for or against some social legislation,
whether it is politically acceptable to say we ought to be doing
more in education, health care and the environment, and have
government play a more leading role than has been the trend,''
Simon said.
   Edgar repeated his campaign assertions that the state will face
a tight budget. He hopes to shift about $100 million in state money
next year to provide more money for mental health, child-abuse
prevention, prisons and other programs.
   Edgar said he was fortunate to win in an election that saw heavy
Republican losses in the Illinois House and the shift of a
congressional seat in northwest Illinois from the GOP to the
Democrats.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Edgar had 1,634,524
votes, or 51 percent, to Hartigan's 1,537,174 votes or 48 percent.
Edgar succeeds four-term GOP Gov. Jim Thompson, who's stepping
down.
   In other major races, Republican Lt. Gov. George Ryan was
elected to the secretary of state post being vacated by Edgar, but
Democrat John Cox defeated Republican John Hallock to capture the
congressional seat Martin is vacating. Hallock had been favored
until he was battered by publicity about a child-support dispute
and a ticket for driving 107 mph.
   Democratic victories in state legislative races also gave the
party a veto-proof 73-45 majority in the state House of
Representatives with reapportionment to be considered next year.
   Two congressional Democrats, veteran Frank Annunzio of Chicago
and freshman George Sangmeister of Mokena, also survived stiff
challenges as their party widened its majority in the state's
congressional delegation to 15-7.

<HEAD>Documents Quote Hirohito as Saying He Feared Coup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The late Emperor Hirohito said shortly after World
War II that he had not opposed attacking the United States because
he feared civil war might otherwise break out in Japan, according
to documents released Wednesday.
   In an eight-hour conversation with aides about his role before
and during the war, Hirohito also rejected the Japanese tradition
that reveres the emperor as a living god, according to a transcript
reported by Japanese media.
   The conversation was held in spring 1946, when Allied Occupation
forces were considering whether to charge the emperor with war
crimes. The discussions appear to have been part of preparations by
aides for a possible trial.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the transcripts were recorded
by Hirenari Terasaki, a former diplomat. Terasaki also translated
for the emperor in some of his meetings with Douglas MacArthur,
supreme commander of the Allies during the postwar occupation of
Japan.
   The broadcasting corporation said that when Terasaki died, the
transcripts of the conversation were given to his daughter, Mariko
Terasaki Miller, who lives in the United States and recently
rediscovered the documents.
   ``If I had tried to veto the beginning of the Pacific War, a
coup d'etat would have occurred, and my trusted aides would have
been killed. My life also could not have been guaranteed,''
Hirohito said. He was referring to fears of an uprising in Japan's
powerful military.
   ``Even if that were acceptable, a violent civil war would have
occurred, resulting in a tragedy several times worse than the
recent war (World War II), and leading to circumstances that the
war would not have ended. I believe that Japan would have been
destroyed,'' Kyodo News Service quoted the transcripts as saying.
He appeared to be referring to the possibility of a civil conflict
between those Japanese who favored going to war and those who did
not.
   Japanese officials met and decided to attack the United States
shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The radio network quoted Hirohito as saying he did not halt the
war later because he feared the public might believe the government
had given in to the United States, despite Japan's strong army and
navy.
   Before he died in January 1989, Hirohito made few public
statements about his role during the war. However, he had
consistently said he did not intervene in the war plans because he
could not, as a constitutional monarch, interfere in decisions made
by the government.
   ``To my knowledge, I have not heard him say that (refer to a
possible coup) before,'' said Otis Cary, a professor at Kyoto's
Doshisha University and an acquaintance of the emperor.
   In contrast, Cary said, Hirohito took a strong role in 1936 in
putting down a coup attempt within the army.
   ``But by December 1941, the situation was so tight. The military
had complete hold on the government,'' Cary said in a telephone
interview. ``The emperor just held his peace.''
   The transcript quoted Hirohito as telling the five aides that it
was ``troubling'' for him to be referred to as a living god.
   ``Biologically, I have the same body as ordinary people, so I am
not a god,'' Kyodo quoted the transcripts as saying.
   Although Hirohito is considered to have renounced his divinity
in a New Year's message in 1946, Japanese rightists have maintained
he did not explicitly deny his prewar status as a Shinto God in the
Japanese translation of those remarks. The comments were originally
written in English and probably intended primarily for Western
consumption.
   Critics charge that next week's enthronement ceremonies for
Emperor Akihito, Hirohito's successor, will violate Japan's postwar
constitution by once again linking the emperor with the Shinto
religion. Akihito's formal coronation has been delayed more than a
year by an official period of mourning.

<HEAD>Daily News Says Parent Company Determined To Keep Publishing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News said Wednesday that top officers
of its Chicago-based parent company remain determined to keep
publishing the tabloid in the face of a 2-week-old strike.
   Tribune Co. Chairman Stanton Cook and President Charles Brumback
visited the newspaper Tuesday and also reaffirmed support for Daily
News management, the newspaper reported.
   Labor leaders contend the Tribune Co. provoked the strike to try
to break the unions and, failing that, fold the money-losing
newspaper.
   Brumback conceded some advertisers pulled out and distributing
the newspaper was a major problem. But he said during a meeting
with senior editors, ``This is a great city and a great franchise
for us,'' the News said.
   He also said departed advertisers were saying, ``If you win,
we'll be back with you.''
   Brumback said claims that he and Cook were calling the shots
were ``baloney,'' adding that publisher James Hoge was in charge
and that ``this is a New York situation and it will be solved by
the Daily News management in New York.''
   A group of clergymen, expressing concern over the economic and
social damage of the strike, came to the News building Wednesday to
urge the News to return to negotiations with its unions. The
clergymen criticized union violence but aimed most of their barbs
at the company.
   Speaking for a clerical ``Coalition of Conscience,'' the Rev.
James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister of Riverside Church, said that
the tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees
``seriously undercuts management's claim to be bargaining in good
faith.''
   Rabbi Balfour Brickner of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue said
the group wanted to meet with Hoge to offer help in ending the
strike.
   Lisa Robinson, a spokeswoman for the News, said, ``This company
is not anti-union. We have negotiated for the better part of this
year and continue to be open to the bargaining process. That is the
place to resolve differences with the parties directly involved.''
   The Tribune Co. also owns the Chicago Tribune and The Orlando
Sentinel.
   The News, the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily, has
been publishing during the strike, which began Oct. 25. The
newspaper says 150 of 350 Newspaper Guild editorial workers have
returned to work.
   The newspaper is difficult to find in many areas of the city.
Dozens of newsstand owners say they stopped carrying the News
because of threats.
   The strike began when a dispute involving the drivers' union led
some deliverers to walk off the job. The News responded by bringing
in replacement workers and the strike spread to eight of nine other
unions, representing 2,100 workers who had been without contracts
since March 30.
   The News insisted during negotiations that it could not survive
without ending what it called union featherbedding.

   A musical revue with specialized appeal, ``Those
Were the Days,'' has opened at Broadway's Edison Theater.
   About two-thirds of the show, which arrived Wednesday, is in
Yiddish. There are little stories in English, introducing songs
sung in Yiddish. Or jokes in English - except for a Yiddish
punchline.
   The five performers have charm. Mina Bern, a senior citizen,
sings and talks with sweet spunk. Robert Abelson, also
silver-haired, has enough voice to sing a creditable ``Largo al
Factotum'' from ``The Barber of Seville.'' Bruce Adler has the
dance steps to propel himself around the stage to ``traveling
music'' as fast as a unicycle rider.
   Eleanor Reissa and Lori Wilner were effective, particularly as
hungry, poor boys in a duet that translates as ``Who Will Laugh
First?''
   Act 1 included songs and stories from an Eastern European Jewish
settlement ``in the time of cobblestone pavement and horse-drawn
carriages.'' The scenes, unrelated, sound like the Yiddish raw
material for ``Fiddler on the Roof.''
   There was the couple who wanted to marry but her mother thought
a tailor wasn't good enough and his father deplored her lack of
dowry. Both parents gave in.
   Act 2, titled ``The Music Hall,'' had more lively music, with
fewer introductions and less English. Some songs were familiar to
an older audience, even one that didn't know Yiddish: ``I Wish I
Were Single Again,'' ``My Yiddishe Mame,'' ``Bei Mir Bistu Schoen''
and, of course, ``Those Were the Days.''
   Reissa directed and choreographed as well as performing. Gail
Cooper-Hecht is credited with the many costumes.
   Moe Septee produced in association with Victor H. Potamkin,
Zalmen Mlotek and Moishe Rosenfeld.

   Iraq on Wednesday promised to free 120 hostages, including a few
Americans, but U.S. officials blasted Saddam Hussein for his
``cynical'' use of the captives and the foreign envoys who have
been seeking to free them.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said the United States is
sounding out member countries on a Security Council resolution that
would authorize the use of U.N. military force against Iraq. If
such a measure is adopted, it would be an unprecedented step in the
history of the United Nations.
   But the text of the resolution has not yet been circulated to
other Security Council members because Secretary of State James A.
Baker III is overseas trying to line up support for it, said the
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We know they've got it on paper, but it would be absurd for
them to pass it (the text) around until they've got all the crucial
support lined up,'' said one official.
   Baker, off on a weeklong tour that has already taken him to the
Mideast, is now in Moscow.
   In Washington, a Pentagon source said late Wednesday that the
Bush administration has decided to send additional armored
divisions soon to beef up the 230,000 U.S. and 70,000 other
multinational forces in Saudi Arabia. The source said most of the
troops and tanks would come from Europe.
   Earlier, in some of her strongest remarks of the 3-month-old
Persian Gulf standoff, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
warned Saddam that ``time is running out'' for a peaceful solution.
   Mrs. Thatcher told British lawmakers they must send the Iraqi
president the message that ``either he gets out of Kuwait soon or
we and our allies will remove him by force and he will go down to
defeat with all the consequences.''
   ``He has been warned,'' she added.
   The Iraqi information minister denounced Mrs. Thatcher, saying
she was mentally unbalanced and possessed by the devil.
   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency,
Minister Latif Jassim said Mrs. Thatcher's statements were ``filled
with rancor and hatred toward the Iraqi people'' and did not befit
the office of prime minister.
   He said ``her continued calls for beating the drums of war
unequivocally show beyond a shadow of a doubt that this woman ...
has lost her mental balance. ... The devil has found a comfortable
dwelling within her mind and conscience.''
   Her saber-rattling sent oil prices surging upward. At the New
York Mercantile Exchange, a key market, contracts for December
delivery of light sweet crude oil were up $2.68 at $35.31 per
barrel a the close of the session on Wednesday.
   In Iraq's latest round of hostage-freeing, 74 Japanese nationals
arrived Thursday in Tokyo from Baghdad. Their arrival was televised
nationally. The official Iraqi News Agency said 100 Germans and 20
other foreigners, including an unspecified number of Americans,
Britons and Italians, would be released.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. officials
had not yet been notified about plans to free any Americans. He
denounced Iraq's ``cynical bartering'' of captive foreigners, who
were trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq did not say when the 120 would be freed, but suggested it
would be soon. The announcement marked the second time in two days
Baghdad agreed to release a large group of captives in response to
an appeal by a former foreign leader.
   The White House on Wednesday took aim at such missions, saying
the foreign envoys were being manipulated by Saddam.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater singled out former West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who interceded on behalf of the
Germans, and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who
won the Japanese hostages' freedom.
   ``Clearly, these people are being used. And we want to point
that out in the strongest terms,'' Fitzwater said. He accused
Saddam of ``cynical attempts at propagandizing this situation'' in
a bid to ``build legitimacy for his government.''
   Iraq still holds hundreds of Japanese and German hostages, along
with other ``guests'' from other countries.
   Japan denied having changed its gulf stance to win its citizens'
freedom, but word that the Japanese hostages would be freed came
Tuesday, just came as Tokyo said it was abandoning its proposal to
send Japanese troops to the gulf region.
   The Iraqi news agency said the German hostages would be freed to
reflect ``appreciation for the German policy, which does not
support trends toward war.''
   Baker, meanwhile, told reporters in Turkey that the United
States ``cannot rule out the possible use of force'' in the gulf.
Later, he flew to Moscow, where is is to hold talks Thursday with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Baker is trying to win a Soviet commitment to go along with a
United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf
region. He won a similar pledge a day earlier in a meeting with the
Chinese foreign minister, U.S. officials said.
   The Soviet Union and China are both permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, and their support would be
essential for any new anti-Iraq resolutions.
   Gorbachev's envoy Yevgeny Primakov, who has met with Saddam
twice in the past two months, said he told the Iraqi leader he
would be attacked if he did not leave Kuwait.
   ``I put it like this to him: `If you do not withdraw, you will
face a military strike against you,''' Primakov told reporters
Wednesday at a Kremlin reception.
   In other developments:
   -A U.S. military source in Bahrain said Navy warships diverted
the German vessel Red Sea Europa last weekend after chemicals
intended for Iraq were found aboard, in violation of the global
sanctions. The source, who demanded anonymity, did not know what
the chemicals were.
   -Iraq calls the hostages its ``guests,'' but it apparently means
paying guests. The Dutch government said Wednesday it had paid part
of a $50,900 hotel bill for Dutch hostages being held at a luxury
hotel in Baghdad. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Dutch government was billed
despite earlier Iraqi assurances that the foreigners would be put
up for free.

<HEAD>Shipwrecked Firefighters Saved by Pilot Seeking Whales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYPORT, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three firefighters battling sharks after
their boat sank on a fishing trip were rescued when scientists
flying in search of whales spotted their makeshift raft in the
Atlantic.
   Mike Davis, John Kaplan and Al Bourgeois left Mayport Tuesday to
go fishing. One of two motors on their 30-foot fishing boat broke
down and the other one failed. Soon, waves came along that flipped
the boat and tossed the men into the water.
   The boat sank.
   Davis was in a wetsuit and had his spear gun, so he began
swimming the 16 miles to shore. He encountered sharks.
   ``One shark was real excited about me,'' Davis said.
   The 9-foot predator followed him until Davis, 37, struck at the
shark with his spear and it swam away, he said.
   Meanwhile, Kaplan, 35, owner of the lost boat, and Bourgeois,
30, clung to a raft of coolers, life jackets and marker floats.
   Twice, boats passed within 30 yards of them. Kaplan fired a
pistol into the air, but the people on the boats were blaring music
and, apparently oblivious of the men, passed them by.
   The pair drifted for four hours when Chris Slay, a researcher
from the New England Aquarium searching in an airplane for whales
with two other scientists, spotted Kaplan and Bourgeois.
   The plane's pilot, Hugh Rawls, contacted the Navy, which called
the Coast Guard.
   ``It we hadn't had professional observers, we would have never
seen them. They looked like a speck,'' Rawls said Wednesday.
``Those poor fellows were hanging on to an ice chest.''
   ``Seeing that plane pass us and then turn around - that was like
being born again,'' Bourgeois said.
   Ten minutes later a helicopter plucked them from the sea.
   During the search for Davis, Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class
Martin Callender was in the bow of a boat when he saw a flash in
the water. It was the sun glistening off Davis' fluttering fins.
   ``I found him because of his fins. I don't think I would have
seen him otherwise,'' said Callender.
   Davis was found about 1{ miles southwest of the other two men.
   All three men were in good condition.
   They said they'd like to meet whoever saved them, and maybe
throw a party with the pilot as guest of honor.

<TEXT>
   A reclusive Georgia businessman with a history
of criminal charges was charged Wednesday with mailing package
bombs that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   Walter L. Moody Jr., 56, long the prime suspect in the case, was
accused of mailing bombs last December that exploded when they were
opened by their recipients, Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance and
Robert E. Robinson, a Savannah alderman and civil rights lawyer.
   The bombs bore marked similarities to one that Moody was
convicted of possessing in 1972, according to federal authorities.
   The indictment, announced in Washington by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and FBI Director William Sessions, also accused Moody of
mailing similar bombs to the Atlanta court where Vance sat and the
Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   Those bombs were defused without causing any injuries.
   The 70-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Atlanta also accused Moody of sending assassination threats to
Vance and his colleagues on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and
mailing a tear-gas bomb to the NAACP regional office in Atlanta.
   Six of the charges, including murder of a federal judge, carry
sentences of up to life imprisonment. He also was accused of
transporting explosive material with the intent to kill and mailing
the bombs with the intention to kill.
   Thornburgh called the bombings acts that ``strike at the heart
of our American concept of the rule of law.''
   ``Those who would seek to attack the integrity and sanctity of
our legal system through violent behavior would undermine the very
foundations of our democracy,'' the attorney general said.
   The indictment capped a massive investigation conducted by the
FBI, postal inspectors and other federal law enforcement agencies
that involved a meticulous examination of millions of court
documents, bomb fragments and other physical evidence.
   Moody has been known to be a prime suspect in the case since
February when FBI agents searched his home in Rex, Ga.
   The FBI also searched the home and business of Robert Wayne
O'Ferrell, an Enterprise, Ala., junk dealer who had written
numerous letters to the 11th Circuit.
   Thornburgh refused to comment when asked if the indictment meant
that O'Ferrell had been cleared as a suspect. But the attorney
general noted that the indictment charges that Moody acted alone.
   Asked if he expected any more charges, Thornburgh said: ``Not
soon.''
   Defense attorney Bruce Harvey said he planned for Moody to plead
innocent to the charges, ``There's absolutely no question about
that.''
   O'Ferrell's attorney, Paul Harden of Evergreen, Ala., said FBI
and Justice Department authorities told them officially Wednesday
that O'Ferrell was ``no longer a suspect and that he is out of the
case.''
   Describing O'Ferrell as a ``very religious person,'' Harden said
he was ``happy and content'' at the turn of events. ``He just
thanked God it was over.''
   Vance died Dec. 16, 1989 after opening the parcel at his home in
Mountainbrook, Ala. Two days later Robinson, an NAACP leader, was
mortally wounded when he opened a package that had been sent to his
law offices, the same day a bomb was found at the 11th Circuit
courthouse in Atlanta.
   The next day another bomb was found at the NAACP office in
Jacksonville.
   The pipe bombs contained the same brand of powder and had
improvised detonators made with the barrels of ball-point pens,
according to the indictment.
   Moody was also charged with sending a Dec. 21, 1989 letter to an
Atlanta television anchorwoman threatening to kill more NAACP
leaders.
   The indictment also accused Moody of sending letters in August
1989 to the 11th Circuit and 14 television stations around the
country threatening poisonous gas attacks on large population
centers.
   Neither Thornburgh nor Sessions would say whether the killings
were racially motivated, although the FBI director had indicted
earlier that race was a possible factor in the case.
   Moody has been in federal custody since July when he and his
wife, Susan, were indicted on charges of trying to suborn perjury
and tamper with witnesses to induce a federal court to vacate his
1972 conviction.
   Moody and his wife, who has petitioned for divorce, are
scheduled to be tried Nov. 27.
   Friends have described Moody as a loner. A psychiatric
evaluation ordered since his indictment last summer concluded that
between 1967 and 1988, ``there may be reasonable cause to believe''
he suffered from mental illness.
   The 1972 conviction arose from charges that Moody made the bomb
with the intention of sending it with an extortion note to an
automobile dealer who had repossessed his car.
   Moody was acquitted of manufacturing the bomb but found guilty
of possessing the device, which exploded and seriously injured his
first wife.
   A 1983 trial of attempted murder charges against Moody ended in
a hung jury.

<HEAD>U.S. Circulating Resolution Authorizing Use of U.N. Force in Iraq</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with other developments. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States has prepared a Security
Council resolution authorizing the use of U.N. military force
against Iraq, a step unprecedented in the history of the United
Nations, diplomats said Wednesday.
   The U.S. Mission has not circulated the text to other Security
Council members because Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
overseas lining up key support for it, the diplomats said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``We know they've got it on paper, but it would be absurd for
them to pass it around until they've got all the crucial support
lined up,'' said one official.
   U.S. officials in Washington who were close to the situation,
also speaking anonymously, confirmed the account.
   One State Department source, speaking privately, insisted,
``There is no U.S. draft on use of force at this point.''
   A document is not technically a ``draft,'' however, until it has
been introduced before the council.
   Baker said in Turkey that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2
``is, after all, the first real crisis of the post-Cold War era,
and it is very important that when the United Nations takes action
and passes resolutions, those resolutions and the act be
implemented.''
   Iraq has defied 10 Security Council resolutions. They include
demands that it free all hostages, withdraw unconditionally from
Kuwait and permit the restoration of Kuwait's government.
   ``Obviously, we want to see a peaceful, diplomatic and political
solution to this problem,'' Baker said, but added:
   ``It is the view of our president and the United States that we
cannot rule out the possible use of force before we see that the
matter is resolved peacefully,'' he said.
   Baker flew to Moscow on Wednesday to continue his diplomatic
initiative on the Persian Gulf crisis, which includes rallying
support for the use of U.N.-sanctioned military force. He then
travels to Paris and London.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has told Parliament
that either Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``gets out of Kuwait
soon or we and our allies will remove him by force, and he will go
down to defeat with all the consequences.''
   On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen indicated to
Baker that his country would not oppose a resolution authorizing a
military strike to force Iraq out of Kuwait, U.S. officials said.
   Qian, who met for two hours with Baker in Cairo, did not
explicitly approve sending troops into action.
   ``We'll have to wait and see,'' Qian told reporters. China is
one of the five U.N. Security Council members with veto power over
resolutions; the others are the United States, Britain, France and
the Soviet Union.
   Iraq seized oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2 and then annexed it. The
United Nations responded by mandating an embargo on trade with Iraq
and ordering it responsible for war damages.
   The Pentagon says more than 230,000 U.S. forces are now in the
region, leading a multinational force of about 300,000 troops. They
face an Iraqi force of about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq.
   Baker's talks in Moscow are the final essential link in the
chain of support Washington needs to take the next step on the
resolution, circulating it among the Permanent Five council
members.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in a Sept. 25
speech to the General Assembly, hinted at a U.N. military
operation, saying ``the United Nations has the power to suppress
`acts of aggression.'''
   ``There is ample evidence that this right can be exercised,'' he
said. But such an step should come only after all peaceful,
non-military forms of pressure have been applied, he insisted.
   The Security Council has never had a unified military command;
the closest approach was in the Korean War, when it authorized the
United States to command the U.N. forces repelling North Korea's
invasion.
   That was only possible at the time because the Soviets were
boycotting the council to protest Taiwan's being seated as the
delegation from China.
   The new U.S. draft resolution marks the first time the Security
Council would approve of U.N. military force under Article 42 of
the U.N. Charter.
   Article 42 permits the council to ``take such action by air,
sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore
international peace and security.''
   ``Such actions may include demonstrations, blockade, and other
operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United
Nations,'' it says.
   In other developments:
   -The head of the U.N. committee monitoring sanctions against
Iraq said she feared some of the medicine amassed by Baghdad since
Iraq invaded Kuwait could be used to make biological or chemical
arms. Medicine is excluded from the economic embargo against Iraq.
Ambassador Marjatta Rasi of Finland said she had no evidence
medical supplies had been diverted for chemical warfare, but she
wanted her panel to have oversight over ``dual use'' medicine.
   -The Palestine Liberation Organization asked the Security
Council to send unarmed U.N. observers to the Israeli-occupied West
Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem to protect Palestinians. Israel
has rejected such a demand, saying it would violate its sovereignty

   Three rare baby Chinese alligators
that were stolen from a breeding farm turned up Wednesday outside a
post office in a paper bag.
   The babies, about a foot long, were covered with a brown
sweater. A note attached asked the finder to return them to the St.
Augustine Alligator Farm.
   The note indicated the person knew nothing about two missing
baby Siamese crocodiles stolen the same time Sunday night, said
Bill Puckett, a spokesman for the farm.
   The returned alligators, believed to be extinct in the wild,
were dehydrated but in good condition, he said. ``We're very glad
they came back so quick.''
   An anonymous telephone caller told the alligator farm Tuesday
that the missing reptiles could be found in a paper bag between two
dirt mounds along a particular road. Reptile curator Greg Lepera
found nothing there and the area had just been mowed.
   Debris was scattered everywhere. It didn't look good for the
gators.
   Another call came to the farm, giving another location, where
they were found by Hastings postal clerk Larry Prevatt.
   The reptiles were hatched in a breeding program conducted with
the Bronx Zoo, Puckett said.

<HEAD>Three Convicted in 21-Ton Cocaine Haul, Mistrial for Three Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men arrested in the 1989 seizure of
21.4 tons of cocaine were convicted of drug trafficking and
conspiracy.
   The jury returned guilty verdicts Tuesday on all charges against
Carlos Tapia Ponce, 69, and his two sons-in-law, Jose Ignacio
Mauricio Monroy Iniguez, 37, and James Romero McTague, 42, the only
U.S.-born defendant.
   Each faces 10 years to life in prison and up to $4 million in
fines. Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 28.
   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. declared a mistrial for
three other defendants after the jury deadlocked on charges against
Hector Tapia Anchondo, 39, Hugo Fernando Castillon Alvarez, 33, and
Miguel Garcia Chavez, 35.
   Prosecutors would not comment except to say they will seek a new
trial for the three. A Nov. 19 hearing was scheduled to set a new
trial date.
   Eight of the deadlocked jurors favored conviction. Juror Keith
Murphy said the four jurors who favored acquittal did not consider
the evidence fairly.
   ``They were biased against police officers,'' he said.
   The September 1989 cocaine seizure occurred in a warehouse in
suburban Sylmar. The cocaine was wrapped in one-kilogram packages
stored in hundreds of cardboard boxes. Authorities also seized $12
million cash during the raid.
   During the trial, which started Sept. 19, federal prosecutors
characterized Tapia Ponce, a retired Mexican customs inspector, as
``the overseer and patriarch'' of the drug trafficking ring.
   The ring used big-rig trailers to ship 77 tons of cocaine from
El Paso, Texas, to the Sylmar warehouse before the raid. The drugs
then would be distributed to buyers, prosecutors alleged.
   Each defendant except Chavez was charged with one count of
conspiracy and one count of possession with intent to distribute
cocaine. Chavez and McTague were charged with possession with
intent to sell 20 kilograms of cocaine.
   At the time of the seizure, federal officials said the quantity
of cocaine was the largest ever impounded by authorities and that
it represented about 5 percent of an estimated annual global
production of the drug.

   William J. Bennett plans to resign within a
week as President Bush's chief lieutenant in the war on drugs,
believing the strategy he designed is working, an administration
source says.
   ``He set out to do a task, he's done it, and he's seeing the
fruition of it,'' the source said Tuesday. ``Now he's going on to
the next phase of his life.''
   The source said Bennett also has been subject to increasing
threats to his safety recently.
   The administration plans a ceremony, possibly before Friday, to
announce Bennett's departure, 18 months after being confirmed in
the post, said the source, who demanded anonymity. The Washington
Post was first to report the resignation, in today's editions.

   Democrats are celebrating a strengthened hold on Capitol Hill
and the takeover of governors' offices in high-growth Sunbelt
states. They swiftly proclaimed the midterm election results ``a
vote of no confidence in President George Bush.''
   In an election framed by fear of recession and war, by
unhappiness with taxes and politicians, governors took a beating.
But despite talk of anti-Washington sentiment, the 102nd Congress
will look much like the 101st.
   Of the 32 senators who sought re-election, 31 won easily. Only
Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz was uncertain of keeping his seat.
In the House, the re-election rate for incumbents was 96 percent.
   With several House races still to be decided, Democrats added 10
seats to their formidable margin of control. That includes Bernard
Sanders of Vermont, who was elected as a Socialist but says he will
participate in the Democratic caucus.

   MOSCOW (AP) - Soviet leaders commemorated the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution today with the traditional Red Square parade, while
anti-government demonstrators played funereal music and unfurled
anti-Communist banners.
   For the first time, alternative demonstrations had been
officially sanctioned in Moscow for Revolution Day.
   Independence-minded Baltic republics told their residents to
boycott the holiday by going to work. And even official media
questioned the wisdom of holding a celebration amid mounting
political, economic and ethnic turmoil.
   Moscow authorities appealed for peaceful demonstrations, hoping
to defuse tensions between Communist Party supporters and radicals
who contend the 1917 revolution served only to throw Russian
civilization into decline.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane shook their fists
and vowed revenge at the funeral of the assassinated militant
leader. Police stepped up security at Arab and Israeli diplomatic
offices and Jewish newspapers.
   Mainstream Jewish leaders in New York and Israel, where the body
of the 58-year-old anti-Arab extremist was flown for burial today,
appealed for calm.
   The alleged assassin remained in serious condition at Bellevue
Hospital. El-Sayyid A. Nosair, 34, of Cliffside Park, N.J., was
identified as a Moslem immigrant from Egypt who repaired air
conditioners for the city of New York.
   Police said they had not established any links between Nosair
and terrorist groups.

   When conditions looked threatening, Marvin
Lender's parents left Poland in 1927 for America, escaping
subsequent persecution and likely death under the Nazis. To him,
something similar could happen again.
   He's doing his utmost to avert the possibility.
   A wealthy, highly successful businessman, he has dropped it all
to help fund history's biggest Jewish exodus - this time from the
Soviet Union to Israel.
   ``They're at risk,'' he said. ``There seems so much that tells
us we could be reliving history again. Enough Jews have died, 6
million in the Holocaust. We can't allow Jews to be killed again.''
   Swift and still swelling in size, the immense immigration to
Israel is being heavily supported by American Jews.
   ``We believe it's saving lives,'' said Lender, national chairman
of United Jewish Appeal, which this year has raised an extra $450
million to help finance the huge resettlement.
   ``Never in history has there been anything as massive as this,''
he said, noting that 101,736 have moved to Israel so far this year.
The number is expected to exceed 160,000 by year's end and to total
a million through 1992.
   That would increase Israel's 3.5 million population by almost a
third. Another 40,000 Soviet Jews are being admitted annually to
the United States.
   `The political situation is so tenuous that we have to act
quickly to get people out,'' Lender said in an interview. ``As long
as the doors don't close, we have that sense of urgency. No one
knows what may happen tomorrow.''
   Lender of New Haven, Conn., has been in Israel five times this
year and the Soviet Union three times. He believes a majority of
the Soviet's approximately 2 million Jews will want to leave.
   ``I don't see many wanting to sty there,'' he said, adding that
the spread of wider Soviet freedoms has unleashed anti-Semitic
groups and incidents, reflecting anti-Jewish attitudes embedded in
Russian history.
   ``The good news is that the gates are open, and the bad news is
that it has allowed hate groups to come out of the shadows,'' he
said.
   Asked if Jews had any obligation to stay there under their
ancient biblical mandate to be a ``light to the nations,'' rather
than withdrawing into tiny Israel, he said:
   ``We have to look at realities. I don't think Jews should stay
in a place where they're not wanted or it's dangerous. If they're
not allowed to live as Jews, then that light is not just dimmed,
but shut off.''
   The biblical responsibility is accepted as a permanent duty, he
said, but to pursue it ``we have to be able to express ourselves in
an open environment.''
   He said that possibility remains clouded in the Soviet Union,
gripped by economic distress and political turmoil in which hate
groups such as Pamyat vilify Jews as scapegoats for problems.
   ``There is no question that a real struggle is going on in the
minds of many Soviet Jews about whether to leave their country,''
Lender said. ``It's been their home for hundreds and hundreds of
years.
   ``You don't pick up and leave home unless there is a real
reason.''
   In some cases, he said,, it divides families, younger
generations from the older. And strain is keen in leaving a
familiar environment and going to a different land of different
language and ways.
   ``They would stay where their roots are if they were not in
danger, if they were allowed to live in peace as Jews,'' he said.
   He added that the UJA-Federation Campaign also is providing
funds for renewing and building Jewish community in the Soviet
Union, where Judaism has been suppressed for 70 years but where new
opportunities have opened to practice it.
   ``Some are hoping to stay there if their lives are not
endangered,'' Lender said. But the Soviet Union, with its new
freedoms, demonstrations, crime, food shortages and factionalism,
``is not so safe anymore,'' he added.
   He said that 70 percent of Soviet Jews entering Israel say they
have experienced some form of anti-Semitism, from abusive epithets
to torching of their apartments.
   Lender, 49, whose immigrant father's tiny backyard bakery
eventually expanded into a nationwide $65 million-a-year
baked-bagels enterprise sold to Kraft in 1984, now concentrates on
community work, mostly raising UJA funds.
   The regular UJA budget this year is $765 million to strengthen
Jewish life here and abroad, plus $450 million added this year for
the massive ``Operation Exodus'' of Soviet Jews.
   ``When we have an opportunity to free people,'' he said, ``we
can't sit by and not do it. I don't want to look at my kids five
years from now when they asked what I'd done, and have to sy
nothing.''

   The year was 1945 and a strike stopped newsstand
distribution of all the newspapers in New York City for 17 days.
   In hindsight - in the aftermath of a series of strikes which
helped drive a passel of papers out of business, in the midst of an
epochal strike that may do the same to the Daily News - it doesn't
seem that bad.
   The strikers were deliverymen, whose demands included wage
reopening as soon as World War II federal economic controls were
lifted.
   Backshop unions and editorial workers stayed on the job. The
papers were printed and were available to anyone who went to the
papers' offices. For those who couldn't, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia
read the funnies on radio.
   There were nine general newspapers in Manhattan, including the
two with the biggest circulations in the nation, the Daily News and
the Mirror. Lively local dailies were thriving in Brooklyn, the
Bronx and Queens.
   Labor wanted a bigger share of what appeared to be an
ever-growing pot.
   Patrick Loughlin signed on as an assistant junior pressman as a
teen-ager in 1947. ``I would have a job for life, I figured,'' he
said.
   Instead, at 61 Loughlin is a walking history of labor strife and
bad times in the New York newspaper industry. Three papers he
worked for since have folded and now he's on strike at the Daily
News.
   The forces that upset Loughlin's calculations in the pressroom,
as well as publishers' plans in boardrooms, were stirring.
   Readers would be moving from city to suburbs. Television would
claim more of the public's time and attention and more advertisers'
dollars. Technology and automation would make many workmen
obsolete.
   Four decades of acrimonious labor-management conflicts would
follow, highlighted by major strikes in 1962, 1966 and 1978. Only
three of the old newspapers survived, the Daily News, New York Post
and The New York Times. A newcomer, New York Newsday, pushed into
town in 1983.
   The New York Sun's 116-year independent existence ended with its
sale to the World Telegram in January 1950. Six months later the
amalgam, the World-Telegram &amp; Sun, was struck by the New York
Newspaper Guild, the reporters' union.
   It was the first strike called under a mutual-aid alliance
between white-collar and blue-collar newspaper unions. The
mechanical workers refused to cross the reporters' picket line and
the newspaper was shut for 10 weeks.
   Determined not to let the unions whipsaw them with selective
strikes, the publishers took a
strike-against-one-is-a-strike-against-all position.
   On Dec. 8, 1962, the automation-threatened printers' union,
headed by Bertram Powers, struck and shut down the News, Times,
World-Telegram &amp; Sun and Journal-American. Five other papers - the
Post, Herald Tribune, Mirror, Long Island Press and Long Island
Star-Journal - closed down immediately in a show of publisher
solidarity.
   Combined, they had been turning out 5.7 million newspapers
daily.
   When the strike ended 114 excruciating days later, loss
estimates ranged from $190 million to $250 million. Lost ad revenue
and newsstand sales totaled $108 million and 19,000 workers lost
$50 million in wages.
   And some lost readership was never recovered.
   Unknowable consequences of the strike resulted from the blackout
in the city's cultural life - first-novels unreviewed, art shows
unreported. Bert Lahr's great performance was for nought when ``The
Beauty Part'' opened in a virtual vacuum on Broadway and closed
quickly.
   In October 1967 when Hearst's New York Mirror folded. Its
circulation had been 800,000, second in the nation only to the
Daily News's 2 million.
   Three more newspapers, the Herald Tribune, the World-Telegram &amp;
Sun and the Journal-American, also succumbed to the times and a
debilitating strike.
   The three papers announced March 21, 1966 that they would merge
into a single company and publish the Trib in the morning and a
combined afternoon paper to be called the World Journal.
   The union response was a strike just as the new venture was
about to begin. Anticipating that half of 1,800 Guild employees
would be let go in the merger, the Guild walked out at the three
papers over the issues of which workers would keep their jobs and
what compensation the others would get.
   The strike lasted 135 days, a record walkout against a newspaper
at the time. Along the way, the Herald Tribune died. The surviving
entity began publishing an afternoon paper named the World Journal
Tribune, shortened conversationally to ``the Widget,'' in September
1966.
   Less than eight months later, the Widget was gone, and 2,600
employees were looking for new jobs.
   The Long Island Star-Journal called it quits during a printer
strike in 1968. Its companion paper in Queens, the Long Island
Press, succumbed in 1977 after seeing its circulation shrink from
440,000 to 257,000 in seven years.
   Automation had enabled the News to publish without printers when
hit with 17-day strike in May of 1974. In the spring of 1977, the
Guild struck the News briefly; the paper published for two days,
until the drivers walked out.
   The Post, the News and the Times went into another bruising
labor battle in August 1978 over what they called featherbedding in
their back shops.
   Unilateral imposition of new pressroom work rules touched off an
88-day strike. At the end, Nov. 5, 1978, the papers achieved their
objective, but at a cost of guaranteeing work for all 1,500 current
pressmen for six years and loss of about $150 million in
advertising and circulation revenue.
   An uneasy peace prevailed until a minor dispute escalated into
war at the Daily News on Oct. 25, and another New York paper went
to the brink.

   Next Monday, Big Bird, Ernie, Oscar the Grouch
and others will start their 22nd season wandering along that public
television path that kids of all ages know as ``Sesame Street.''
   There'll be a few changes. Two teen-agers are joining the cast.
So is a Claymation creature, Cecille Ball. Oscar's mother will come
to visit. Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams each will be in two
``Sesame'' shows.
   And the new ``Street'' season will concern race relations. It
will try to show pre-schoolers that it's the heart and mind, not
skin color, that matters - even though, as Kermit the Frog so
eloquently sang it once, it's not easy being green.
   Next Monday also will be a special occasion for Joan Gantz
Cooney. It'll be her first season as the ex-chairman of the show's
producer, Children's Television Workshop. She turned the reins over
last month to David Britt, a veteran CTW executive who has been
with the production company for 18 years.
   But she's staying with CTW, and especially with ``Street,'' she
says, because ``I want to work entirely on the creative side and
the strategic planning side.''
   Her renewed involvement with ``Sesame Street'' is due ``in some
degree'' to the death last May of Muppet-master Jim Henson, who
created a number of characters for the show, including Kermit.
   Although the series has an extensive tape library of Henson's
characters, ``I want to make sure that the relationship with the
Muppeteers continues very strong, and that we create, maybe, new
characters,'' she says. ``I'm interested in seeing that the show
stays very contemporary.''
   It is that, having gone from four to five basic educational
goals its first year to a teach-while-entertaining ``curriculum''
for pre-schoolers that Cooney estimates has covered 200 topics.
   They include sibling rivalry, pre-science, death, adoption and,
of course, love.
   Last season, the series, which is seen in 80 countries and still
is aimed at children 2 to 5 years old, began segments set in a home
day-care center for tykes.
   That was done and remains in the series ``because it's something
our audience can identify with,'' says ``Street'' executive
producer Dulcy Singer. Increasing numbers of kids wind up in
day-care centers or after-school programs because their parents,
whether divorced or still married, must work to make ends meet.
   ``Children are much more in day care and after-school programs
now,'' says Cooney, who because of that has two projects afoot,
neither intended for TV.
   One is to develop after-school ``packages'' using CTW's other
educational shows, ``Square One'' and ``3-2-1 Contact,'' ``to tutor
kids in math and science, kids staying after school because their
parents work,'' she says.
   The other is a planned pilot program in which ``Sesame Street''
materials and books would be used for children's activities in
Dallas day-care centers.
   Also afoot for next season, but on PBS, is an as-yet untitled
literacy series to teach reading and writing skills to children 7
to 12 years old, she says.
   As with the major networks, cable, independent stations and
videocassette players have bitten into PBS' audience, and ``Sesame
Street'' has been among the shows affected. But not so much in the
morning, Cooney says.
   The real ratings drop of ``Street'' is due mainly to cable's
Nickelodeon channel aimed at viewers 2 to 15, she says. It occurs
in the afternoon when older children come home from school and
commandeer the TV set.
   At such times, she says, ``the little kid that might want to
watch `Sesame Street' is overpowered by his or her older sibling.''
   Pondering ways to deal with this and other problems will be part
of her work now with the company she co-founded.
   ``It's like having a 22-year-old child,'' she said of her new
role at CTW. ``The child may not need you full time. But when the
child needs you, you're there for it.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``CHEERS,'' ``MURPHY BROWN'' GET THE ONCE-OVER: NBC tonight is
airing a one-hour retrospective of its top-rated ``Cheers.'' The
hour will be moderated by John McLaughlin, the keep-it-quick
discussion show host whose ``The McLaughlin Group'' series is a
fine example of how Washington journalists can be taught to
harrumph oudly, and on cue.
   Also tonight, Diane Sawyer is taking viewers of ABC's
``PrimeTime Live'' behind the scenes of CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' the
noted CBS comedy series about a network news magazine series. It is
not known if ``Murphy Brown'' later will go behind the scenes of
``PrimeTime Live,'' which is not a comedy series.

<HEAD>What's Hot in 1992? Could be the Drive to Limit Politicians' Terms</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It started as a sleeper among issues, but the
drive to limit politicians' terms is awake and kicking now, and the
people pushing the idea say they'll seek to put it on at least 15
state ballots in 1992.
   Claiming headway in both the victories and frustrations of
Tuesday's off-year elections, term-limit campaigners will meet in
Washington early next month to talk about their next steps.
   While the immediate target is the state legislatures, their
ultimate aim is to limit tenure in Congress.
   Term limits were approved on Tuesday in Colorado and California,
the two states that had the issue on the ballot and, for good
measure, in Kansas City, Mo., which put a ceiling on city council
tenure. Oklahoma voted for term limits earlier in the fall.
   And then 95 percent of the House incumbents who ran again won
again, an outcome one strategist said would help the push for
limits. ``Even in an anti-incumbent year, you can't beat 'em,''
said Eddie Mahe, a Republican campaign consultant and advisor to
Americans to Limit Congressional Terms.
   It is largely a Republican movement, although some Democratic
candidates signed on during the campaign. Measures that force
turnover would work to GOP advantage; they are outnumbered in the
legislatures as in Congress, and Democrats have just extended their
House control to 38 years.
   Proposed constitutional amendments to limit congressional tenure
to 12 years have, predictably, gone nowhere in Congress. The
measure approved in Colorado on Tuesday would apply to members of
Congress as well as state offieholders, and therefore it is
certain to be challenged in court.
   So the political pressure point is in states, especially those
that hold direct elections on such questions. Elsewhere, Mahe said,
the term limit drive will be pressed in the legislatures, where
lawmakers may be loath to limit their own tenure but likely to
approve a call for limits in Congress. That might just offer some
openings for ambitious state lawmakers who'd like to get to
Washington.
   In the three states that have approved term limits, the voters
overrode opponents who insisted that limits are no cure for the
ills of government, state or federal, and could make them worse.
Strong, seasoned legislators would be dismissed along with weak
ones, the opponents say, while bureaucrats and lobbyists would gain
even more clout.
   ``I think term limits is really a reaction against the fact that
so many of our congressional elections, and our other elections,
are not really competitive,'' said Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio,
chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.
   Mahe said that when, and if, more states impose limits, or at
least call for them nationally, Congress will start to feel the
political heat. ``Once those are in place at the state level, the
pressure at the national level is going to be geometrically
increased,'' he said.
   ``This is going to be an issue,'' says Vice President Dan
Quayle. ``You had the tax revolt in the 1970s and early 1980s, and
in the 1990s, I think, you're going to see the voter revolt.''
   Campaigning for Republican candidates this year, both Quayle and
President Bush pushed term limits. The 1988 Republican platform
endorsed limits on House and Senate tenure, without saying what the
ceiling should be. Quayle says he favors 12 years.
   ``All around this country there is a growing momentum for
limiting terms of legislators,'' Bush said before the elections.
``...Term limitation is an idea whose time has come, and I think
its time has come to Capitol Hill, frankly.''
   Quayle built part of his set campaign speech around the issue.
   ``The chairman, listen to this, the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee has been in the Congress longer than my
mother and father have been married. He had seven years of
seniority when I was born,'' he would say, drawing ripples of
laughter. ``I tell you, there is an idea that is sweeping this
country, and that is the idea that it is time to limit the
terms...''
   The chairman, Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., just won his 26th
term.
   But there is turnover, for all the power of incumbency, and more
than 60 percent of House members have been elected since 1960.
   Mahe said the organizations pushing term limits will seek
commitments from House candidates in 1992 that they won't seek to
serve more than a dozen years in Congress. ``When they're running
for the first time, 12 years looks like a long time,'' he said.
   To a veteran, though, it doesn't look that long. Former Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy, who also served in the House, once recalled
that he'd arrived as a foe of the seniority system.
   But the longer he stayed, McCarthy said, the more he saw the
wisdom of it.

<HEAD>Hobby Income Not Just `Fun Money'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American taxpayers who mix business with
pleasure have to be careful not to get tangled up with the Internal
Revenue Service.
   As old as that precept may be, it carries an up-to-date message
for ``moonlighters'' who earn income from a hobby or other sideline
activity.
   Whether the endeavor in questionreeding show dogs or growing vegetables
in your back yard,
Uncle Sam has a claim on any proceeds it brings in.
   The size of that claim may well depend on whether the enterprise
qualifies as a business or is deemed a not-for-profit hobby.
   In the case of a bona fide business, taxpayers are normally
allowed to write off all expenses, even if to do so produces a loss
that reduces their other taxable income.
   With a hobby, by contrast, expenses can be deducted only against
income from the activity itself. ``Hobby losses are considered
non-deductible personal losses,'' point out the authors of the
just-published 1991 edition of J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax.
   Just how do you distinguish between the two? Through legislation
and rulings over the years, a series of standards has evolved.
   First of all, any venture that shows a net profit for three out
of five consecutive years is presumed to establish itself as a
business in earnest.
   If you breed or train horses for racing or show, the requirement
is two years out of seven.
   In the event that those criteria aren't met, notes the United &amp;
Babson Investment Report, a Boston-based advisory service, ``the
status of an activity is judged on a case-by-case basis, since the
circumstances and facts of each are unique.''
   Among the yardsticks that can be applied: Is the venture
operated in a businesslike manner, with a substantial amount of
expertise, expenditure of time and effort and diligent
record-keeping?
   Does it hold out the prospect of some reasonable return on
investment? Is there a practical basis for hope that assets used in
the activity will increase in value?
   And, conversely, does it involve spending a lot of time in
pursuits that are recognized as sources of recreation and personal
enjoyment? Can the money it brings in make a real difference in
your personal financial affairs?
   ``While none of these tests alone would qualify an activity as a
hobby, the general picture that evolved from all the tests would,''
United &amp; Babson says.
   With all the effort that has been devoted to defining the
difference between hobby and business, the verdict often comes down
to a judgment call.
   Rest assured that the authorities are not hesitant to make such
rulings. Consider the case, cited recently by the accounting firm
of Laventhol &amp; Horwath in Philadelphia, of a telephone company
worker who moonlighted in a direct-marketing business.
   The first year the worker claimed business revenues of $981 and
deductible expenses of $23,000; the next year he listed revenues of
$867 and expenses of $17,000.
   Not a business, declared the IRS, and therefore ineligible for
the deduction of any expenses that exceeded income. A Tax Court
judge agreed, citing a lack of ``the requisite profit motive.''

<HEAD>Are We In A Recession?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time a recession is officially recognized
it may have been under way for as long as an entire quarter of a
year, and that presents a real problem for those in charge of
steering.
   It is, as has been obversed again and again, like trying to
steer a great ship on the basis of conditions in the channel behind
it, rather than on the traffic and other obstacles in the channel
ahead.
   It leads to a condition where the White House and Congress,
which determine fiscal policy, and the Federal Reserve, which keeps
its hands on the levers of monetary affairs, decline to use the
term recession when everyone else does.
   Both wait for verification from lagging indicators, from what
has already passed, rather than from indicators of what lies ahead.
   The White House says the economy is growing. The latest word
from the Fed is that it hasn't seen certain signs of recession. But
both are reading gauges of what has happened, but not of what is
likely to happen.
   In contrast, you can't find many private-sector economists who
aren't using the word recession.
   Market and consumer researcher Albert Sindlinger says the
recession is already 10 months old. Investment counselor Russell
Redenbaugh says that if we weren't in one before the budget
agreement, we are in one after it.
   Redenbaugh, partner and director of Cooke &amp; Beiler, Inc. of
Philadelphia, reasons this way:
   1. It was made posible by the increase in Social Security taxes
that began January 1.
   2. It was made more likely by the energy shock associated with
the tensions in the Middle East.
   3. It was made inevitable by the current round of tax increases.
   Economists for government and economists for the private sector
use the same economic reports to reach their conclusions, but
government workers tend to be less inclined to stick out their
necks and peer into the future.
   Private-sector economists often use their own studies. One of
these, a monthly and quarterly survey of about 2,000 small
businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business,
tells how confident business people are.
   That confidence level, to be released next Monday, is likely to
reach a 109-year low, making it quite easy to conclude that a
recession already is under way, to be announced later by the
government statisticians.
   Some private economists also discount and revise the official
figures. In fact, a survey of business economists earlier this year
showed a growing number of them do not believe some of the
government's figures are reliable.
   Sindlinger, whose own surveys of household buying power have a
30-year history, related some of his misgivings in his regular
report to clients this week. Here are two of them:
   -How can the Commerce Department say that wages in salaries in
September grew 5.83 percent over a year earlier, when the Labor
Department said that weekly earnings in the same month grew only 4
percent?
   -If September's retail sales, as announced by the Commerce
Department, were only 0.9 percent above last year, how can the same
department claim that September consumer spending was a relatively
strong 6.85 percent higher?
   Alan Cymrot, now a consultant but a former real estate executive
who bought and sold billions of dollars of real estate, has a
simple formula for those who want to reach their own conclusions
about the economy.
   First, he said, you must recognize that the American economy is
driven by the consumer, not by business and government. And what
drives the consumer? Wages do. And what is happening to wages, he
asks?
   He suggests that you might look at the latest statement from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among other things, it shows that
580,000 factory jobs have been lost since January 1989, 175,000 of
them in the past three months.
   In short, your own employment condition or that of your
neighbors might be as good an indicator as those belated official
recession announcements.

   Seventh-day Adventist women leaders are urging
members to stop tithing to the church until it agrees to ordain
women to the ministry.
   The board of the Adventist Women Institute also offered at a
meeting in Redlands, Calif., to accept such tithes in a special
escrow account until the church approves ordination of women.
   The Denver Post quoted Fay Blix, former institute chairwoman, as
saying: ``We've threatened this for a long time, and we are finally
realizing that the bottom line is green.''
   Most Adventists tithe, which means giving 10 percent of earnings
to the church. The church's general conference last summer voted to
continue its ban against women ministers.
   ``We just want to be treated as equals,'' said Vicki Danielson,
a Denver Adventist.
   Many women members were said to have started attending other
churches, and others to have quit tithing.

   TUPELO, Miss. (AP) - The executive committee of Christian
Leaders for Responsible Television has called off a boycott of
Burger King, only a month after it was invoked, saying the chain
has decided to be more selective about shows it sponsors.
   In previous monitoring, CLeaR-TV had found the company helped
sponsor two-thirds more sex, violence and provanity than the
average advertiser. The Rev. Billy Melvin, chairman of CLeaR-TV,
said the company has promised to support traditional American
values with its advertising dollars.

   CLEVELAND (AP) - The Roman Catholic Canon Law Society of America
has turned down a resolution calling for ordination of married men,
reversing a process begun two years ago.
   However, several members said the resolution was defeated
because of its poor reasoning, not its conclusions. Two years ago,
the society set up a commission to prepare a petition to U.S.
bishops favoring such ordinations.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Jewish leaders are commending Roman Catholic
Cardinal John O'Connor for suggesting the United Nation had made
Israel a ``scapegoat'' in condemning that country for killing
Palestinians during an Arab riot.
   In a column in the archdiocesan newspaper, O'Connor said it was
``too coincidental'' that the condemnation came under ``pressure to
maintain the solidarity of nations against Iraq.'' He said nobody
would profit by ``creation of scapegoats.''
   In ``a day when too many of Israel's friends seem to be turning
their backs on her,'' he wrote, ``I am proud to call myself her
friend, as I am proud to call many in the Arab world friend.''

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - The collapse of the communist
system in Eastern Europe has thrown supporters of liberation
theology into a quandary, says a veteran ecumenical social
activist.
   ``Those with a vision of a totally egalitarian society are a
little shocked,'' says the Rev. Paul Abrecht, director of the
social-action arm of the World Council of Churches for 33 years.
   He said in an interview that liberation theologians had believed
that a state socialist system in which all people share equally
could be achieved without totalitarian methods, but the collapsing
communist system made plain that was virtually impossible.
   Nevertheless, he said ``mixed economies that have developed in
the non-communist world are too materialistic and too individualic
to endure in a world which is seeking a more comprehensive sense of
community.''

<HEAD>Churches Assail New Movie Rating as Facade for Smut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some American church leaders say the movie
industry is pulling a deceptive ruse on the public, making the bad
look good by labeling the ugly with a pretty name.
   Such is the general assessment by a broad range of churches,
Protestant, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic, of the new system
under which previously X-rated movies now are rated NC-17.
   Terming the change by the Motion Picture Association of America
a surrender to ``sexually exploitative material,'' officials of the
U.S. Catholic Conference and the National Council of Churches said:
   ``It is an arrogant and ill-advised decision which deeply
affects the public good. It was made in isolation, without public
consultation. The change is neither in the public interest nor in
the best interest of the industry. ...
   ``Changing the name of the `X' category does not change the
nature of the material.''
   Southern Baptists, the largest denomination not in the council,
also endorsed the joint protest. The Rev. Richard D. Land, head of
that denomination's social-concerns agency, said:
   ``The change has all the appearances of watering down an
effective wall that helped people stay away from pornographic
materials.''
   Religious publications contended the change camouflages the
nature of the formerly ``X'' category so movie theaters would be
more apt to show such films.
   It gives movie-makers ``a `respectable' category for their
excesses,'' says the Rev. James M. Wall, editor of the ecumenical
weekly, The Christian Century. ``The restraint is removed.''
   Wall, a movie buff and chairman of the National Council of
Churches' Media Ethics and Advocacy Committee, said the change
basically is ``about what kind of world our children will live
in.''
   The Catholic Messenger, diocesan weekly in Davenport, Iowa, says
the ``marketplace now has more freedom than it had two weeks ago to
disturb your children's growth.''
   The editorial adds that films of ``sickening violence and the
debased or irreponsibile or glamorized fantasy use of sex'' will
now be ``much more widely distributed and shown.''
   The church critics aren't advocating censorship or government
curbs on films, warning that the change itself will provide
ammunition for ``thoe who already are calling for regulation of
the media.''
   ``That is unfortunate, because a voluntary system of
self-regulation that skirts constitutional concerns, yet affords at
least a minimum of protection to the public, is workable,'' the
interchurch statement says.
   The movie industry contends that the ``X'' rating has come to be
understood as indicating only pornographic films and thus has
downgraded some serious, adult films of artistic merit.
   Most theater chains don't show X-rated films and most newspapers
won't take advertising for them. Some newspapers, such as the
Birmingham (Ala.) News, extended the advertising ban to NC-17
films.
   ``Smut is still smut,'' the News editorialized.
   In the new system, films considered of some merit but whose
sexual or violence portrayals exceed limits for an ``R'' rating are
to be given the new ``NC-17'' rating, meaning no children under 17
are to be admitted.
   The ``R'' or restricted rating, meaning admission of youngsters
only if accompanied by a parent, is continued, with explanations
provided on why a film is placed in that category, such as its
depiction of sexual activity, violence, profanity, drug use or
suicide.
   However, no explanations will be given for ``NC-17'' films.
   The motion picture association said they would ``continue to be
evaluated as X-rated films have been in the past, that is, on the
basis that most parents would agree'' such films should not be
viewed by youngsters.
   Wall says ``poor enforcement policies'' of theaters indicate the
NC-17 age restriction won't be effective. Already, he writes, ``R''
pictures are ``easy for 13-year-olds to see, with or without their
parents.''
   James Arnold, a movie critic for many Catholic publications,
says much depends on theaters enforcing the specified restrictions,
but ``their track record is not encouraging.''
   The first movie to get the new NC-17 rating, ``Henry and June,''
features lovemaking between two women.
   In the new situation, Ted Baehr, publisher of Atlanta-based
Movieguide, was organizing a conference in Washington Nov. 16 of
religious and other groups to promote community-based rating boards
for movies.
   He said such boards are frightening to film industry officials.
   The joint Protestant-Catholic statement suggested similar steps,
urging local congregations and others in each community to
``monitor closely'' enforcement of restrictions for the ``newly
contrived NC-17 rating'' and others.
   Members of the Association of Theater Owners were asked to to
refuse to book NC-17 movies and newspapers were asked to reject ads
for such movies.

   It's not easy getting to Jose Zamora's house.
He and his neighbors prefer it that way.
   They are among about 400 people living in a migrant camp that
resembles a small city of makeshift homes assembled from sheet
metal, cardboard, plastic and plywood.
   The camp's residents are legal and illegal aliens, mostly from
Mexico, who try to get work as day laborers at private construction
firms or at large commercial nurseries nearby.
   The camp, which residents call Rancho de Los Diablos, or Devils
Ranch, is tucked away in a canyon near expensive homes in the
Fairbanks Ranch area. The only road leading to it is a 3-mile,
bumpy dirt trail. It's not easy to slip into this little community
unnoticed.
   ``Life here in this ranch is very tranquil,'' said Zamora, a
32-year-old mustached and muscular man from the state of Michoacan
in Mexico's interior.
   A metal chain and lock are used to protect his habitat, although
in most cases, it would be easier getting into some of the houses
by slicing through the cardboard walls.
   But no one has to worry about that, residents said.
   ``We live pretty much in peace. No one bothers anybody here.
Everybody minds their own business,'' Zamora said as he sat in his
hut, which has two makeshift beds, a nightstand, a chair and a few
odds and ends.
   He, like his neighbors, came to the United States in search of
jobs. Their stories mirror each other's. Most left families behind,
and any excess money they earn is sent home.
   ``There is not much work in my town and so I decided to come
here,'' said Selso Quiroz, a 19-year-old recent arrival from the
Mexican state of Oaxaca. He says he'll work at anything.
   ``My mother and father didn't want to let me come, but then they
said that I can take care of myself. I miss them a lot,'' he said
as tears welled in his eyes.
   Even though immigration officials know the location of the camp,
it rarely is raided. Agents say they don't have the manpower to
sweep it frequently.
   This migrant camp is unlike many of the others. The residents
are squatters, but not really. The owner of the land has allowed
migrants to stay on the property free of charge as long as they
keep the place clean.
   A half-dozen portable toilets are strategically placed in the
camp, which runs about 300 feet on either side of a trickling creek
for about half a mile.
   A 5,000-gallon tank of water is trucked in regularly. Residents
ferry the water back to their shacks in 5-gallon buckets.
   One of the only problems in the camp, residents say, is that
trash builds up on one side and is infrequently cleared away.
   Although many residents cook their meals in small campfires just
outside their huts, Gloria Torres recently joined her husband at
the camp and opened up a small restaurant in the middle of the
settlement. She sells beef-bean-and-rice dinners for $3 a plate.
   ``Business has been good,'' she said recently as she took a
break. Her stove is an upright 55-gallon drum that burns wood
placed in an opening of the barrel.
   Catering trucks frequently station themselves at the camp,
selling burritos, sandwiches, juices, soft drinks and beer.
Residents can even run up a tab until payday.
   There are recreational areas, including a small soccer field,
basketball court and volleyball net.
   On certain weekends, a ``swap meet'' is held where dealers sell
portable tape players, cassettes, jewelry, shoes and clothing.
   The little community even had a mayor once, but residents say he
returned to Mexico a few months ago and a successor has not yet
assumed the role.
   Some residents also are given English lessons twice a week by
volunteers.
   ``I really want to learn English because I like it and maybe
someday I can get a job here,'' said 6-year-old Nancy Torres, the
daughter of the restaurant owner.

<TEXT>
   Hsing Yun fled China in 1949 with only his
grey robe and cotton shoes. Today, he is a millionaire monk,
praised by some as a philanthropist, reviled by others a mail-order
preacher.
   He has more than 400,000 disciples in Taiwan, 27 monasteries
around the world and assets valued at more than $400 million.
   In two decades, Hsing Yun has fashioned a Buddhist empire that
stretches from Taiwan to Australia and the United States. He runs a
temple in Las Vegas and hopes to build a university in Los Angeles.
   Last year, the 63-year-old monk returned to China as a
philanthropist, drawing big crowds as he donated handsomely to
dozens of temples.
   His influence, popularity and cash won him a meeting with
China's president, Yang Shangkun, despite the fact that the
Communist Party strictly controls religion.
   To critics, who feel Buddhists should be austere, Hsing Yun is a
mail-order preacher who makes a fortune from contributors seeking a
fast route to Nirvana. He operates his temples as a big business,
they say, raking in profits with special prayer services for the
wealthy.
   Supporters say Hsing Yun offers free prayer services and free
Buddhist education to the poor, who include about 500 students at
his six Buddhist colleges.
   They also praise the monk's political acumen and his philosophy.
   Unlike the many Buddhist masters who instruct their disciples to
give up pleasures for a better afterlife, Hsing Yun teaches how to
achieve peace in a busy, industrial society.
   Hsing Yun has called on many world and religious leaders who
avoid visiting diplomatically isolated Taiwan. To the Taiwan press,
he is the island's ``super diplomat.''
   The monk's Hsi Lai Temple near Los Angeles has given refuge to
several dissidents who fled China after the June 1989 crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement. Earlier this year, Xu Jiatun, China's
top diplomat in Hong Kong, stayed at the temple after abruptly
leaving the British colony.
   ``If we live in reclusion and are concerned only about
cultivating ourselves, what do our nation and society want us
for?'' Hsing Yun asked during an interview. ``Money comes from all
quarters and goes to all rounds.''
   In Taiwan, huge crowds attend Hsing Yun's frequent rallies,
where he uses anecdotes from Buddhism to teach people how to build
happy families. He also uses radio and television to preach his
message.
   Hsing Yun was born into a peasant family in Jiangsu province,
became a monk at 12 in a monastery at Nanjing, central China, where
he took his current name. It means ``stars and clouds.''
   He fled to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949 after
Communist forces won the civil war. For two years, his main job was
to get water from a well for the monks and guests at a temple in
western Taiwan.
   In 1966, he used royalties from his writings to buy a mountain
in Kaohsiung in the south. In the following years, he used
disciples' donations and bank loans to build Fo Kuang Shan, or
Mountain of Buddha's Light, into a complex of temples, schools,
guest houses, an old-age home, a museum and cemeteries.
   Fo Kuang Shan has become a tourist attraction, with 10
glittering temples and a bronze Buddha 120 feet tall surrounded by
480 smaller ones at its feet.
   Inside the main temple are two pagodas 30 feet tall, each
illuminated with bulbs and engraved with 7,200 miniature Buddha
statues. Under computer control, they revolve and broadcast
Buddhist hymns.
   Hsing Yun, who retired as abbot of Fo Kuang Shan four years ago
but still controls temple business, says he lives a simple life and
uses his money to educate the public about Buddhism.
   ``Buddhism is a human religion,'' he said as hundreds of
disciples in black gowns prayed and sang hymns in a hall next to
his reception room. ``Monks and nuns must reach out and maintain a
world view.''
   One of his most ambitious plans is to open Hsi Lai University in
Los Angeles for Americans interested in religious studies.
   Next year, a department of religious studies will open in his
Hsi Lai Temple. Land still is being sought for the campus.
   ``Americans have built universities in China and Taiwan,'' he
said. ``We should also do something to help cultural exchange with
the West.''

   There has been no war along this boundary since
the United States intervened in Mexico's revolution more than 70
years ago. But that does not mean all is peaceful. This first in a
two-part series on immigration problems at the California-Mexico
border looks at violence along the world's busiest border crossing.

<TEXT>
   Oscar Lopez Medina sat atop a hill,
moments after slipping into the United States through a broken
fence. He surveyed the rough terrain on the horizon, keeping an eye
on U.S. Border Patrol vehicles cruising below him.
   Lopez, a 22-year-old from the Mexican state of Guerrero, was
waiting for darkness to fall so he could continue his illegal entry
into the United States.
   There was a time when Lopez' journey would have been easy. But
no longer. The San Ysidro-Tijuana crossing has become the busiest
legal and illegal border entry point in the world. Also one of the
most violent.
   The canyons separating San Ysidro, Calif., and Tijuana, Mexico,
are full of bandits, rapists and killers who prey on undocumented
workers making their way north to cities like San Diego, Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
   Eleven aliens have been killed along this 14-mile section of the
border in 1990, with the most recent victim a teen-ager shot by a
Border Patrol agent who claimed the boy had initiated a rock
attack.
   Hundreds more have been robbed, raped and beaten by bandits who
also strip the aliens of their clothes and cut off their hair.
   The violence has prompted police to supplement their patrols
with SWAT officers, and Border Patrol agents to install dozens of
floodlights to illuminate the once-dark canyons.
   It also has resulted in legislation to increase the 800-man
Border Patrol force in San Diego and sparked calls by a grassroots
group to revamp the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which
gave amnesty to some aliens and included employer sanctions.
   But the illegal aliens continue to cross by the hundreds of
thousands and the violence against them continues not only at the
border, but in the California communities where they look for work.
   ``I have heard that it is dangerous to cross, but what can I
do?'' Lopez said. ``I need to cross, to go find a job so I can send
money back home. If I make it this time, maybe I can bring my
family next year.''
   Authorities say that most of the violence against illegal aliens
is perpetrated by Mexican nationals who wait in the brush, attack
their victims and cross back into Tijuana. But migrant advocates
say the increased vigilance by Border Patrol and SWAT officers will
make the area even more violent.
   ``The lights that they put up will work for a little bit, but
the migrants and bandits are just moving to places where there are
no lights,'' said Roberto Martinez, who tracks border issues for
the American Friends Service Committee.
   ``It's futile and the violence will continue,'' he said.
   Border Patrol officials say the violence on the California line
is higher than in other sections of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico
border because of the number of people crossing, among them more
women and children.
   But Border Patrol spokesman Ted Swofford says that because of
increased patrols, the violence by bandits has decreased in recent
months.
   ``The bandits are still out there, but the incidents of
robberies, rapes and pillaging have gone down significantly,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, the number of arrests of illegal aliens has been
increasing slowly after declining when the immigration act was
enacted four years ago, Swofford said.
   For every illegal alien arrested, officials have said about
three get away. Those who do eventually end up looking for day
laborer jobs, making low wages that still are more than they can
make back in Mexico.
   During the day, people wanting to cross into the United States
begin arriving at various locations along the border. One of the
most popular spots in recent months has been a hilltop west of the
legal port of entry.
   Some wait in the hot sun while vendors, standing under blue
plastic tarps, sell cold drinks, food and sometimes even clothing.
   The migrants watch as Border Patrol vehicles scurry about a
half-mile below them. Slowly, the migrants make their way into the
bushes and brush as they try to zig-zag their way, with the help of
a smuggler, to Interstate 5 and their road north.
   As darkness falls, those at the top of the hill make a rush,
after first surveying the land to find the best route and then
trying to remember it at night.
   Some get through. But others are caught by the Border Patrol,
attacked by bandits lurking in the brush or, like 80 people in the
past four years, killed while trying to cross busy highways.
   Border Patrol officers say they, too, are the victims of
violence. So far this year, agents have been assaulted 217 times,
according to agency records.
   ``Most of the rock-throwing incidents are diversionary tactics
instituted by the smugglers themselves to get the agents' attention
so others can come help him and then they create a hole
somewhere,'' Swofford said.
   To protect themselves, many of the Border Patrol vehicles along
the border have been transformed into ``War Wagons,'' with metal
grills covering windshields and windows to protect them from the
rocks.
   But migrant advocates, including attorney Marco Lopez, said that
the Border Patrol agents frequently instigate trouble. For
instance, in one incident last year, a Border Patrol agent shouted
obscenities through his car's PA system at Mexicans on the other
side of the border.
   ``The officers themselves make it more violent,'' said Lopez,
who frequently represents victims of police or Border Patrol
shootings. ``It's a violent area and sometimes they are justified
in using force, but in some cases they are not.''
   Yet Assistant Chief Manny Guaderrama, who oversees the San Diego
Police Department's Border Crimes Intervention Unit, says officers
are saving lives.
   ``These officers do not provoke violence. They have received
special firearms training and they are real cool under fire, under
stress and they are not going to be provoked into jumping into
anything that shouldn't take place,'' Guaderrama said.
   The unit was formed after a similar one, the Border Crime
Prevention Unit, was disbanded in 1989 after 26 people were shot in
a five-year period. The BCPU was a cooperative program with the
Border Patrol. Now, police and Border Patrol officers work
separately.
   U.S. officials also have been trying to work with Tijuana police
and Baja California officials to set up a communications network
that will help in responding to border crimes.
   ``Our (national) capitals are too far away to impress upon them
the problems we have here,'' said Baja California Gov. Ernesto
Ruffo during a tour of the border recently. ``We need to work
together more closely to clear up some of these problems so we can
catch the bad guys.''
   Added San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who was with
Ruffo: ``This problem is like a toothache. You ignore it until it
gets bad. Now we have a situation that people on both sides of the
border can agree on - preserving human life.''

<HEAD>`Against the Law' Survives, Despite Low Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How good can you be if you're one of the
lowest-rated shows on prime-time TV?
   Very good, if you're ``Against the Law,'' the drama starring
Michael O'Keefe as a maddog kick-'em-in-the-crutches Boston lawyer
that very nearly died this fall at the tail of Fox Broadcasting
Co.'s Sunday lineup.
   ``It seems that maybe 10 o'clock on Sunday night is not the best
time for this show,'' Daniel Blatt, a former practicing attorney,
said with magnificent understatement just three weeks after taking
over as executive producer.
   In season-to-date viewership, ``Against the Law'' ranked 97th,
beating only the Fox documentary series ``American Chronicles'' and
a few other Fox shows now off the air.
   The show's protagonist, Simon MacHeath, is a less-than-heroic
figure. His courtroom tactics are nothing short of contempt. He
opened the pilot episode, for example, jailed for contempt, then
addressed the jury using a zucchini to simulate a tender portion of
his male client's damaged anatomy.
   ``MacHeath is inherently someone who understands the nature of
the way the system works,'' O'Keefe said.
   ``You're going to have to play their game, get better at it, and
punch wherever you can punch in order to make your points. Because
if you don't, you just run the risk of being another statistic. ..
.
   ``If you're going to win in a system like that, you're going to
have to just pull out all the stops. We might bend the
verisimilitude of the courtroom in order to make a point or two
about what happens, but most of the lawyers I know say `Right on.'
''
   Critical reaction to the show has been mixed. Some TV wrters
liked it very much, others not at all.
   And audiences didn't know what to make of it.
   Older viewers already had migrated from Fox to Sunday night
movies on ABC, CBS and NBC. Fox's hip, younger audience, coming
into the show after two solid hours of kinky comedies, hadn't a
clue.
   ``I think that's hurting us,'' O'Keefe said on Nov. 2. ``I think
that these comedies that are leading into us are not necessarily
the audience that's going to be interested in our show.''
   There's another reason, O'Keefe said.
   ``Fox will be the first to tell you that they haven't promoted
the show,'' he said. ``They have four shows that they promote in
order to ensure the success of their network: `Married ... with
Children,' `In Living Color,' `The Simpsons,' and `America's Most
Wanted.' That's their bread and butter.
   ``The initial thrust that the networks have is over,'' O'Keefe
said. ``Fox can begin to promote some of their smaller shows and
shift their schedules to adjust in whatever change they're going to
be making.''
   On Monday, Nov. 5, the ax almost fell.
   Fox told The Associated Press the show would go into hiatus,
with a ``re-launch'' sometime after the first of the year, maybe
even in the spring, when Fox has had good luck with replacement
shows.
   Overnight, Fox changed its mind and ``Against the Law'' won a
reprieve.
   ``Against the Law'' would replace the low-rated police drama
``DEA'' in the 9 p.m. EST Friday night slot, behind the
reality-based ``America's Most Wanted'' crime show, said Peter
Chernin, president of Fox Entertainment Group. ``We've always been
big believers in the show,'' Chernin said. ``I think it was just a
feeling that Friday at 9 p.m., it had a better chance.''
   ``DEA'' will return later this season, and ``Comic Strip Live''
slides into the vacated Sunday night slot, Chernin said.
   On Friday nights, ``Against the Law'' will compete with
younger-skewing comedies on ABC and NBC, and CBS' older-skewing
``Over My Dead Body.''
   Finally, ``Against the Law'' gets the chance to compete on its
own.
   The show was in trouble early in the season, signaled when
series' co-creator David Manson departed politely as executive
producer, citing ``creative differences'' with Fox executives on
the direction the show.
   Fox, which sees itself very much as the ``outsider'' television
company, had wanted a show about another an anti-establishment
rebel, Manson said shortly before his departure.
   ``What they felt was that a lot of the legal shows tend to be a
little staid and stuffy,'' he said. ``We wanted to be a little more
irreverent, a little more sardonic, and a lot more theatrical.''
   Blatt, the new executive producer, said his mandate is not to
change the direction or tone of the show.
   ``What I hope to try to do is to create realistic situations,''
he said, ``and place into those situations a lawyer who because of
his strong beliefs is willing to push the envelope as far as he can
to protect his clients.''
   Blatt also has retained an old friend, Harvard Law School
professor Gary Bellow, as legal consultant to the show.
   This pleases O'Keefe, the son of a law school professor and the
brother of a lawyer and a law school student.
   ``Bellow's a really serious national litigator,'' O'Keefe said.
``He travels all over the country litigating cases, accrediting law
schools and advising inept actors about the nature of trial
advocacy.''
   At the same time, however, O'Keefe believes that the show's
strength still will be to find the drama of the law and show the
absurdity of the system.
   ``People took us to task on certain issues,'' he said. ``I don't
think we're infallible in any means. Artisticially, legally, we're
certainly worthy of criticism. But the power of the show is
undeniable for those who have found it and watch it.
   ``And if they give us the chance to accrue the audience, they're
going to have like a critical and commercial success on their
hands. Then what're they going to do?''

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. plans to lay
off up to two-thirds of its investment banking division, sources
say, as the chairman of the Wall Street firm declared that
``business stinks.''
   The cuts, revealed Tuesday at the investment bank that touts
itself in ads as ``rock solid, market wise,'' are the latest in the
securities industry's devastating recession that has reduced
employment by more than 45,000 jobs since 1987.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street's big commodities markets have
decided to stay in the nation's financial center rather than flee
to New Jersey, giving a major boost to the city's sagging economic
fortunes.
   The decision Tuesday by the four exchanges, which trade products
from orange juice to crude oil, comes during a devastating
financial industry recession. The city and state gave the Commodity
Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York
Mercantile Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange $145 million
in tax breaks, land and other incentives to stay on Wall Street.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - United Press International has laid off more
employees, a day after company officials said the news service
faced liquidation unless remaining workers accepted a 90-day pay
cut of 35 percent.
   ``There have been some further dismissals in various departments
of UPI,'' spokesman Milt Capps said Tuesday. He declined to give
detais.

   ATLANTA (AP) - BellSouth Corp. said it will eliminate up to
3,000 management jobs through a special retirement option for
certain employees.
   The plan announced Tuesday, effective Dec. 1, is being offered
to management employees who are eligible for retirement, the
company said. It is a result of increasing competition in the
telecommunications field, said Roy Howard, senior vice president of
corporate human resources.

   ATLANTA (AP) - An Atlanta federal judge will hear a consolidated
lawsuit alleging collusion and price-fixing by some of the nation's
major airlines and their computerized fare network.
   The suit was formed when 31 claims filed nationwide were
consolidated Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia. It alleges the airlines use computers to
signal fare changes to each other, agree on price increases and
threaten fare cuts.
   The defendants are USAir, Northwest, Delta, Continental, United,
TWA and American airlines and the Washington-based computer
clearinghouse, Airline Tariff Publishing Co.

   LONDON (AP) - London's Stock Exchange confirmed it was
investigating more than a dozen suspected ``bear raids'' in which
stock manipulators illegally profit by spreading malicious rumors

   ``It is certainly true that there have been a growing number of
complaints,'' said a stock exchange spokeswoman who was not
identified, in accordance with exchange practice.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's largest airlines improved their
on-time performance in September, achieving their best record in
the past two years.
   They also set a record for the fewest reports of lost or
mishandled baggage. The Department of Transportation, releasing its
monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, said Tuesday the nation's 12
largest airlines reported that 84.3 percent of their flights
arrived on time in September.

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has entered into a
merger agreement to acquire The Wholesale Club Inc. for about $170
million, the companies announced.
   Wal-Mart President David Glass said Tuesday the Wholesale Club's
outlets and operations would complement Wal-Mart's Sam's Wholesale
Club Division and give the discount chain a significant presence in
new markets.
   The Wholesale Club operates 27 membership clubs in six states.
Sales for the six-month period ended Aug. 4 totaled $333 million.

   McGovern and his partners in the Stratford Inn filed the

   With big-money deals ``scarcer than a lizard's
smile,'' Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. is putting frowns on the
faces of its investment bankers.
   In the latest example of Wall Street's shrinkage, sources said
Prudential-Bache plans to lay off two-thirds of its investment
banking professionals. Other firms have made cuts in the
once-lucrative area recently, though not as large.
   The layoff sword hangs over almost all investment firms, and
Wall Street recruiters report an uptick in calls from anxious
executives. But many professionals fear leaving one firm for an
unsure fate elsewhere.
   ``The gloom is so widespread they're not sure about going
someplace they're unfamiliar with,'' said Howard Gabler, president
of GZ Stephens Inc., an executive recruiting firm.
   Industry powerhouse Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. last week said it was
reducing its investment banking force by 6 percent. Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. also recently laid off
investment bankers.
   Investment banking was the growth area of the 1980s, financing
mergers and acquisitions and raising capital for companies.
   First Boston Corp. is expected to lay off banking professionals
in coming weeks as part of a broad retrenchment. An executive who
asked not to be named confirmed that the firm reduced its
operations and information services staff by 50 employees on
Monday.
   ``True qualty people will be set loose,'' Gabler said. In past
cuts, ``the best people were still employed. Six months from now I
don't know whether that will be the case.''
   Employment industrywide has dived 17 percent to 216,000 at the
end of June from 262,000 in October 1987, according to the
Securities Industry Association. The reductions place the industry
at 1985 levels, still about 55 percent above total employment in
1980.
   Prudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
on Tuesday confirmed it was abandoning a four-year effort to become
an investment banking power, drastically reducing the size and
focus of the division.
   In a statement, Prudential-Bache did not specify the size of the
cuts but sources at the firm who spoke on condition of anonymity
said about 120 of 180 investment banking professionals would be
laid off. Additionally, an undetermined number of the division's
100 support personnel are to be axed.
   Prudential-Bache Chairman George Ball said in a memo to
employees last week that slumping business ``argues for a smaller,
leaner crew moving forward'' that will focus on specific industries
where the firm has succeeded in the past. He said the investment
banking division lost money last year and thus far in 1990.
   Ball blamed the problems partly on the division's lack of an
established client base. With business down across the board, firms
with longstanding clients are more likely to survive the industry's
recession.
   ``Solid investment banking deals continue to be scarcer than a
lizard's smile,'' Ball said in another recent memo. ``The fault
isn't our bankers'; it's environmental.''
   He said the overall industry is no better, as individual
investors and money management institutions are afraid to commit
money. ``Business stinks,'' Ball said. ``When the vacation season
ended, investors seemed to stay on the beach.''
   Prudential-Bache spent more than $110 million strengthening
investment banking to expand on its power as a retail brokerage.
But the expansion bid stumbled.
   The firm's investment banking division was ninth on Wall Street
based on market share for underwriting activity so far this year,
according to IDD Information Services. Prudential-Bache ropped to
13th in fees from corporate investment banking this year, down from
ninth in 1986.
   Cuts at the firm, which lost $51 million last year, also are
expected in other divisions, including risk arbitrage, which
involves speculative trading in the stocks of potential takeover
targets, another business that has faded.

   The city's victorious effort to keep Wall
Street's commodities markets from abandoning New York for New
Jersey could help induce other financial industry giants to stay,
analysts said.
   But city officials said companies shouldn't assume that a
package of $145 million in land, tax breaks and other incentives
given to the four commodities exchanges would be routine for every
company that threatens to leave New York.
   The decision Tuesday by the exchanges comes during a 3-year-old
financial industry recession and general economic malaise that has
resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in New York in recent
months.
   ``Had they lost this case it would have made holding on to some
others much more difficult,'' said Hyman Grossman, a managing
director of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which is reviewing the city's
credit rating. ``These things seem to go in waves and they feed on
each other.''
   Several financial firms are contemplating whether to stay in
Manhattan after their leases expire in the mid-1990s. One of major
concern is top Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which has
examined sites in Connecticut and met with city officials on
Tuesday to discuss its plans.
   With a budget crisis and gloomy economic forecast, analysts said
the city can ill afford to lose large players in the critical
financial industry. Already, PaineWebber Inc. and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. have relocated some departments across the Hudson River in New
Jersey.
   Securities and commodities industry employment was 136,900 in
September, down more than 15 percent from its peak of more than
161,000 before the stock market crashed in October 1987.
   In contrast to the rest of the industry, the four exchanges -
the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the
New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange -
have grown sizably since the crash.
   The city faced losing nearly 12,000 jobs and $1.3 billion a year
in goods, services and salaries generated by the industry, which
has been straining to expand in order to compete with rival
exchanges in Chicago and elsewhere. Employment is projected to soar
to up to 23,500 by the year 2000.
   Under the deal, New York state and city will provide $145
million in incentives for the exchanges to relocate from cramped
quarters at the World Trade Center to a new building to be
constructed on an empty lot nearby, to be completed by mid-1994.
The new site will triple the size of the exchanges' total space to
1.2 million square feet.
   The exchanges will receive $82 million in capital from the city
and state, while the city will own the land and building. The
exchanges also will get $32 million in real estate tax abatements
spread over 25 years, low-cost power, and some sales and mortgage
tax abatements.
   By keeping the exchanges, though, the city and state retain $165
million a year in tax revenues. Sally Hernandez-Pinero, deputy
mayor for finance and economics, said the city expects to recoup
the incentives within three and a half years.
   She said the incentives package would not be a guarantee for
other financial industry firms considering leaving New York. ``You
have to look at every case on its merits,'' she said. ``This is not
a precedent for everyone else.''
   The site at the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City,
N.J., was just one subway stop from New York's financial district
and offered a bigger trading floor - 100,000 square feet compared
with 75,000 at the Manhattan site.
   Despite a strong financial offer by Jersey City, officials said
the exchanges' 120-year history in New York's financial industry
was a deciding factor.
   ``New York is the financial capital of the world and ... if the
deals were comparable, we belonged here,'' Commodity Exchange
Chairman Martin Greenberg said. ``There were citizenship
concerns.''

   The gap between the European
Community's plan to cut farmers' subsidies and demands by the
United States and other major farm exporters threatens to stall
talks to overhaul world trade.
   An official of the 14-nation Cairns group of major agriculture
exporting countries called the EC proposal ``very disappointing.''
   ``It's a minimalist position,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   After 10 hours of bargaining Tuesday, EC agriculture and trade
ministers agreed to a proposal for a 30 percent cut in subsidies
for major crops over 10 years, beginning in 1986. Some reductions
have already been made.
   With the proposal, the EC will become the final major trade
partner to submit an offer to the trade talks, a four-year effort
by more than 100 countries to lower international trade barriers.
   The United States has proposed 75 percent cuts in farm income
supports and 90 percent reductions in export subsidies over a
10-year period beginning in 1991.
   The EC proposal does not cut export subisidies, which make it
easier for Europeans to sell their more expensive goods on world
markets.
   The ministers, who had failed in six previous attempts, worked
under intense international pressure to come up with an offer.
   Argentina, one of the Cairns countries, had threatened to walk
out of the broader Uruguay Round of trade talks if the EC did not
make a proposal soon. Other nations were seen moving in that
direction.
   The United States and other agriculture-exporting countries
regard farming as the key to success in the talks, which cover 15
areas ranging from textiles, telecommunications and services like
banking. The Uruguay Round, held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is scheduled to end with a final
set of meetings next month.
   EC officials fended off criticism that their proposal falls
short.
   ``It's a good, solid and sound proposal,'' said Ray MacSharry,
the top EC farm official.
   He said the Community plan was ``more realistic'' than the far
deeper cuts suggested by the United States and others. He called on
the other countries to make equally realistic offers.
   ``What I would say to the other partners is: `Match this before
you argue with it,''' MacSharry said.
   Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero said: ``It would be a
grave error on the part of our partners to judge that the position
of the Community is not a position of great openness and
ambition.''
   Last month, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills had dismissed
the trading bloc's proposal as inadequate. ``If we used that 30
percent figure, the United States could raise its levels of support
and protection,'' she said in Geneva.
   Tuesday's agreement ended a nearly month-long impasse on the EC
bargaining position.
   British Agriculture Minister John Gummer said the Community's
drawn-out discussions showed its trading partners that further cuts
would be very hard.
   ``It is clear from the negotiations that the European Community
(does) find reductions in support extremely difficult,'' he told
reporters.
   France and Germany had prevented agreement on an EC proposal by
insisting on a series of guarantees that the cuts would not be too
severe on farmers.
   In the end, the ministers adopted a list of assurances that
promised not only to compensate farmers for income losses, but also
to make sure that imported goods could not be sold more cheaply
than home-grown products.
   The agreement also pledged to limit the impact of the reductions
on poor regions of the Community and to soften proposed cuts in
olive oil and other products widely grown in Mediterranian
countries.

<HEAD>Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Posts Big Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan posted a
$352 million loss for the third quarter, indicating further
hemorrhaging at what was once the nation's most profitable thrift.
   The collapse of the nation's junk bond market helped bring
Columbia's losses to $1.4 billion for the last five quarters. The
loss for the third quarter amounted to $16.83 a share. In the first
nine months of the year, Columbia had a loss of $781.8 million, or
$38.37 a share.
   Columbia's junk bond collection, once estimated at $4 billion,
is now worth slightly more than half that amount.
   The thrift's latest loss, reported Tuesday, further increases
the ultimate cost to taxpayers should Columbia fail and be seized
by the government.
   Experts have projected that taxpayers would be forced to pay
between $500 million and $1 billion to cover the savings and loan's
federally insured deposits.
   Normally, Columbia would have been seized long ago. But
regulators have been working with thrift management to sell its
junk bonds privately so the government might escape being saddled
with them.
   In the third quarter, the market value of Columbia's bonds
plunged by $226 million, a drop that Columbia chief executive
Edward Harshfield called unprecedented. Harshfield stressed that
the thrift has sufficient cash to meet depositors' demands.
   Because of the huge numbers of companies that have defaulted on
the risky, high-yield junk bonds, their market value has been
severely diminished.

   Striking Daily News workers have pressured a
black journalists' organization into rescinding its offer to
provide the newspaper's management with a list of potential
replacement workers.
   The National Association of Black Journalists - which had agreed
to sell its list for $400 - withdrew the offer Tuesday.
   Meanwhile in Brooklyn, a grocery store was firebombed early
today, and the owner said he recently had received threats not to
sell the Daily News, officials said.
   The fire, set off by a Molotov cocktail, caused extensive damage
to the store and slightly injured three firefighters, said Fire
Department spokesman Lt. Frank Martinez.
   An incendiary device was thrown into the same store Friday but
caused no damage, said Sgt. Edward Burns, a police spokesman. The
owner, Salah Zamzemi, told police he had received threats and had
not been selling the newspaper, according to Burns.
   No suspects have been found in either incident, Burns said.
   Dozens of local newsstand owners say they have received warnings
not to carry the Daily News. At least one newsstand has been
firebombed.
   The decision by the black journalists' group was announced by
its president, Thomas Morgan, after striking workers held three
news conferences, sent him a telegram and telephoned him.
   ``There was a perception that this was seen as furthering
management's position. That was never our intention,'' Morgan said.
``We still feel our members have the right to make up their minds
about this issue.''
   The News had sought to buy membership lists from the black
journalists group, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists
and the Asian-American Journalists Association. Representatives of
the two other groups said they refused.
   ``We understand why the journalists' associations might not want
to offer even the appearance of taking sides in the dispute,'' said
James Willse, editor of the News.
   The first of 2,100 workers in nine unions struck the News on
Oct. 25 over what they said were unfair labor practices.
   Union members at the News, whose normal circulation of 1.09
million made it the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily, had
been working without contracts since March 30.

<HEAD>Report: Paley Estate Executors May Opt to Sell CBS Holdings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A heavy tax liability may prompt the sale of the
late William S. Paley's 8 percent stake in the media giant CBS
Inc., a published report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal said a sale seems likely because the
Paley estate, valued at about $550 million, must raise $190 million
to cover tax obligations.
   A sale of such a large block of CBS stock could rekindle
speculation about a takeover of CBS, which has long been the
subject of such rumors.
   Paley, the longtime chairman of CBS who built the company over
60 years, died last month. Much of his estate including 1.9 million
shares of CBS stock valued at nearly $300 million is to be divided
among his six children.
   But the Journal said people familiar with the situation said the
Paley estate's executors may take a vote next week on whether to
sell the CBS holdings.
   ``We will probably sell that whole block to pay the bills,'' the
story quoted someone identified only as a person with knowledge of
the estate's finances.
   A sale would mean the Paley family would cease owning any part
of the company Paley founded in 1928 and could put a large chunk of
CBS stock into the hands of a single buyer, the story said.
   CBS president and chief executive Laurence A. Tisch controls
Loews Corp. and its 24.9 percent stake in CBS and analysts say his
holdings is likely to insure that no unfriendly takeover of CBS
could occur.
   At the same time, analysts feel Tisch is unlikely to expand his
stake in the company becaus of federal regulations that govern a
``change of control'' of the company.
   CBS currently enjoys an exemption from rules barring owning TV
and radio properties in the same market, but that exemption would
be lost if a new owner would acquire a 25 percent stake in the
company.
   Company executives say privately that Tisch is committed to
improving CBS' performance in the primetime TV ratings and that he
is not likely to sell his stake until he accomplishes that task.
   Media analysts note that the depressed state of media stocks,
uncertainty over whether the major TV networks will be allowed to
have a financial stake in more of the programming that they run and
the prospect of a continuing weak advertising environment make it
an inopportune time for a sale.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
carryover of sporadic selling from Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.95 to 2,480.20
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 272 up, 466 down and
458 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be on hold awaiting the
results of a quarterly offering of bonds and notes by the Treasury,
which began on Tuesday and continues through Thursday.
   The refunding encompasses a record $34.25 billion in securities
with lives ranging from three years to just under 30 years.
   Investor demand for that enormous supply apparently has been
bolstered by expectations of new moves soon by the Federal Reserve

<HEAD>Premier Indicates Change in Policy Over Most-Promising Oilfield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng indicated willingness Wednesday
to give foreign companies a role in developing China's
most-promising oilfield, so far closed to foreign involvement.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li made the statement
during a meeting with the president of Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.,
Shinroku Morohashi.
   ``Morohashi said that Mitsubishi has a great interest in
expanding economic cooperation with China, especially in the
electric power, oil, chemicals and transport industries and
personnel training,'' Xinhua reported.
   Morohashi specifically mentioned the Tarim Basin in northwestern
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, saying Mitsubishi ``is
ready to participate'' in oil development there, Xinhua said.
   ``Li responded by saying these items hold great potential for
cooperation,'' Xinhua reported. ``He said he hoped that the two
sides would not only cooperate in new and big projects, but also in
the technical transformation of China's old enterprises.''
   A Mitsubishi spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Li gave ``a very good impression'' that arrangements could be
worked out for joint projects in the Tarim Basin. But he said the
officials did not discuss details or a possible timetable.
   Testing has indicated that the 560,000-square-kilometer Tarim
Basin is rich in oil and natural gas deposits. The official China
Daily said the region is ``very likely to become the country's
major oil and natural gas production center.''
   The newspaper said experts estimate the Tarim Basin has 12
billion tons of oil and gas reserves.
   China previously has allowed foreign involvement in offshore
drilling and exploration of small onshore deposits in the south,
but has been very protective of the Tarim Basin holdings, said
Edward Chow, spokesman for the U.S.-based Chevron Oil.
   He said several foreign companies are interested in oil
development in Xinjiang province, but they insist on arrangements
that would give them equity in the Tarim Basin oilfield if it
eventually can support commercial projects.
   Chinese officials have refused to allow such arrangements
because they want to control the natural resources of the Tarim
Basin, oil industry experts say.
   Chow said a foreign company willing to provide services and
technology without demanding equity in the Tarim Basin fields would
have the inside track in dealing with the Chinese.
   ``A lot of companies are interested, but they want different
ground rules,'' Chow said.

<HEAD>CF&amp;I Steel Files For Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CF&amp;I Steel Corp. and nine subsidiaries
filed petitions for reorganization Wednesday under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Frank Yaklich Jr., president and chief executive officer, said
the company will continue to operate during reorganization.
   CF&amp;I, baseed in Pueblo, is a major producer of steel products
for energy, transportation and agricultural markets.
   ``We filed Chapter 11 to resolve some financial problems,'' he
said. ``This action was taken only after all other options had been
exhausted. I want our employees, customers, shareholders and
suppliers all to know that CF&amp;I is a survivor and that we are
confident CF&amp;I will emerge from this new challenge a stronger,
better company,'' Yaklich said.
   The company's move toward bankruptcy protection began after it
was unable in September to make a $12.3 million payment on its
pension plan, an underfunded liability estimated at about $140
million. Since then, it has missed an October quarterly payment of
$1.8 million.
   A Chapter 11 filing gives a company a reprieve from its bills,
including such things as pension plan payments, while working out a
way to stay in business.
   The company blamed a series of outside economic problems that
occurred at the same time, including a deterioration in the energy
industry in 1982 and 1983 that led to a downsizing of the company.
   The company said the downsizing dramatically increased the
number of retirees, and reduced its ability to fund the plan.
   CF&amp;I said it will seek to terminate the plan in the future. The
company said if the plan is terminated, obligations to current and
future retirees would become the responsibility of the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government agency that insures private
pension funds.

<HEAD>City Fears Loss of Preeminence As Europe's Financial Capital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Currencies like the lira, mark, or franc could go
the way of communism in Europe.
   A plan adopted by the big European industrialized countries
would create a single currency controlled by a common central bank
as part of a move toward monetary and economic unity in the
continent.
   The ``City,'' Europe's largest financial center, wants in on the
deal. But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposes the current
proposal, and that upsets some City economists and businessmen who
worry they could be left in the cold.
   London is considered an anchor in the global trading day, which
starts in Tokyo and ends in New York.
   But already, ``the center of gravity of the European financial
system is shifting away from us towards Paris and Frankfurt, and
the City is rather nervous about this,'' said Alan Budd, a Barclays
Bank economist.
   Experts say resisting moves toward currency union would erode
Britain's largest industry. Financial services account for nearly
20 percent of the gross domestic product and support 12 percent of
the nation's jobs.
   So-called ``invisible trade,'' including banking, finance,
insurance and business services, earned more than half of Britain's
foreign earnings of nearly $390 billion last year.
   Kenneth Wright, a director of the British Invisible Exports
Council, said: ``We're worried.''
   Currency union has emerged as the focus of a long-running,
deeply divisive debate within the governing Conservative Party over
Britain's role in the 12-nation European Community.
   At a summit meeting in Rome last month, 11 of the leaders voted
to begin the second stage of European Monetary Union on Jan. 1,
1994. That stage includes the establishment of a European central
bank, followed by the creation of a single currency.
   Britain recently fulfilled its commitment to the first stage by
entering the EC's exchange rate mechanism. Under the mechanism,
Britain's pound sterling is allowed to fluctuate no more than 6
percent from an agreed-upon exchange rate.
  But Mrs. Thatcher voted no to a commitment to stage two, saying
it was premature to set a date when the community still hasn't
decided exactly what the second stage will entail.
   ``The fact that the 11 other members of the community are
spearheading the (EMU) move ahead means the City ought to be part
of it,'' Sir Michael Butler, chairman of Hambros Bank Ltd., said.
   Being left out ``certainly would have adverse effects,'' he
said.
   A committee made up of 18 City heavyweights and chaired by
Butler has agreed unanimously that Britain should play a full part
in the creation of EMU and its operation.
   Wright said the City backs a plan advanced by Mrs. Thatcher and
Chancellor John Major for a ``hard ECU'' - a European currency unit
that would be used as an alternative 13th currency.
   That plan, developed by Butler and a colleague, envisions the
common currency evolving into a single currency after some years.
   But if European leaders decide on one new currency to replace
the existing 12 right away, that would be acceptable to his
industry, Wright said.
   ``The majority of the City does want to be a part of monetary
union,'' he stressed.
   Butler sees little sentiment in the financial district to
support Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to join a European central bank
or to abolish the pound sterling.
   London's preeminence as a financial center already faces rising
competition, and the increasing economic focus on the continent
doesn't help.
   Commanding the attention these days are the planned creation of
a pan-European, trade barrier-free marketplace of 320 million
consumers by the end of 1992; the unification of already
economically dominant Germany; and the rebuilding of Eastern
Europe.
   Because London's stock market and other financial services are
better automated, more sophisticated and less regulated than in
other capitals, the City now handles more foreign exchange, bond
and share trading than any other European city.
   London also is the center of European banking, with more than
500 banks; the home of the world's largest insurance and shipping
markets, and a major commodities center.
   Monetary union would radically alter the financial services
industry in Europe. There would no longer be trading, for example,
between Italian lire and German marks. Bonds would be issued in the
single currency, and Europe would have a uniform interest rate.
   If Britain stands aside, Wright said, the City would have to
find ways to compete as an outsider. But many players would simply
move to the continent, Butler said.
   An obvious effect of being an outsider would be to raise the
City's operating costs, Wright said. Transactions would have to be
converted into pounds, adding the cost of commissions and the delay
of additional paperwork.
   Players also would have to cope with any differences in the
regulations of the Bank of England and the European central bank.
   Nonetheless, at least one expert believes Britain could flourish
as an offshore financial center for a unified continent.
   Noting Switzerland's success as a financial center outside the
EC, private economic consultant Tim Congdon said, ``It isn't at all
the case that if Britain refuses to take part (in EMU) that the
City would become a backwater.''
   He said he believes Britain could compete from the outside by
continuing to offer more relaxed bank cash reserve requirements and
higher interest rates.

<HEAD>GM Venture in Czechoslovakia Expands Automaker's Presence in
Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Wednesday announced a
further expansion into Eastern Europe with a transmission and
vehicle assembly agreement with the government of Czechoslovakia.
   GM will hook up with Bratislavske Automobilove Zavody factories
in Bratislava to make 250,000 transmissions for GM's Opel AG
factories in Europe. The partners also will assemble a small number
of Opel cars to distribute in Czechoslovakia.
   GM, the largest automaker in the world, has been eyeing the
former Eastern European bloc not only as an expanding market for
its products but as a largely untapped manufacturing base.
   Within the last year, as Eastern Europe's Communist regimes
began falling and new markets opened up, GM has announced
manufacturing projects for Hungary, the Soviet Union and eastern
Germany.
   In Eisenach, in the former East Germany, GM and Automobilwerke
Eisenach began building Opel Vectra cars on Oct. 5, two days after
German unification. The two companies plan to build automobile
components later.
   By the mid-1990s, GM is expected to begin making the Opel Kadett
four-door sedan in eastern Germany. There is a possibility a new
factory will be built to handle the expected production increase
that will be needed with the Kadett.
   The largest project by far is the $1 billion project between GM
and Volga Auto Works of the Soviet Union. There, GM will supply
engine control systems Volga needs to sell its Lada cars in Europe
and other markets.
   In Hungary, GM will make 200,000 engines a year and 15,000 Opel
cars in a joint venture with the state-owned truckmaker RABA,
beginning in 1992. The engines are destined for GM assembly
operations elsewhere in Europe and the cars initially are to be
sold only in Hungary.
   Details of the GM-BAZ project in Czechoslovakia still must be
worked out, GM spokesman Jack Harned said Wednesday. There is
existing space for the new transmission and vehicle assembly work
at BAZ's plants.
   ``There obviously will be some significant investment in
equipping,'' Harned said.
   Chrysler Corp. has planned a joint venture to make minivans in
Austria. Ford Motor Co. is looking at vehicle assembly plants in
Eastern Europe, but so far is concentrating its efforts in Western
Europe.

<TEXT>
   The long-awaited agreement by European Community
ministers on farm subsidies improved the mood among negotiators
Wednesday at vital world trade talks. But not by much.
   ``It keeps the talks alive, although only just,'' said a source
at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is sponsoring
the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.
   The EC's submission of its offer to cut farm subsidies by 30
percent seems to open the way for genuine hard bargaining in the
talks, which are due to finish in less than a month.
   ``We hope things can now change. We hope that we can make
progress in the next few weeks,'' Brazilian ambassador Rubens
Ricupero said in an interview.
   But wide rifts loom in other key sectors. Attempts to reduce
trade restrictions on textiles are fraught with the most problems.
Talks on new rules on services have run into late hurdles, and
negotiators are struggling to find common ground in other areas.
   Ministers are scheduled to meet Dec. 3-7 to agree on a package
of accords covering 15 sectors. Draft texts are due by Nov. 23.
   The talks, launched in Uruguay in 1986, are the most ambitious
attempt ever to liberalize global commerce and boost world economic
growth. If they fail, analysts expect a surge in protectionism and
damaging trade wars.
   The talks have not been smooth, particularly those in
agriculture. Argentina, which has threatened to walk out if
trade-distorting subsidies are not slashed, dismissed the EC offer
even before it was announced.
   Officials from the United States and Australia also termed the
EC proposal unacceptable. The United States and other farm
product-exporting nations want 90 percent cuts in export subsidies
and 75 percent cuts in import barriers and internal supports.
   GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel starts top-level discussions
on agriculture Thursday. But these will merely determine whether
countries will be prepared to negotiate on the EC offer, according
to one source.
   However, another source said there was ``very, very guarded
satisfaction,'' that the EC had issued a proposal at all, thus
enabling talks to resume in other areas.
   Trade in textiles will also be the subject of secret
negotiations conducted by Dunkel at GATT headquarters on Lake
Geneva.
   Although there is consensus that existing restrictions on trade
in textiles should be phased out, there is no agreement on how
quickly.
   Developing countries want rapid action. They accuse
industrialized nations, under pressure from powerful domestic
textile lobbies, of lacking political will in pushing the
negotiations forward.
   Talks to help liberalize the $600 billion annual trade in
services have also hit snags. Realizing that some industries may
lose long-standing benefits, the United States, and to a lesser
extent the EC, have started pressing for exemptions to the planned
rules, especially in shipping, aviation and telecommunications.
   Other difficult areas include duties against dumping, the
practice of unloading goods on foreign markets at lower prices than
they're sold domestically.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with end of trading in Europe.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly weaker in Europe today,
hitting new postwar lows against the German mark and Swiss franc
amid concerns over the U.S. economy and the election results.
   Gold prices were higher in generally light European trading,
supported by the weaker dollar and news about the Middle East
crisis. Gold is considered a safe-haven investment in times of
political uncertainty.
   With the U.S. economy continuing its slide, the currency markets
expect the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates in an effort to
stimulate business activity. Lower U.S. interest rates make the
dollar less appealing to foreign investors.
   Dealers said the dollar's losses were also fueled by news that
Democrats gained in state and congressional elections on Tuesday.
Democratic economic policies are perceived to be more likely to
lead to higher inflation, which erodes purchasing power and could
making the dollar worth less.
   The dollar fell in hectic late afternoon trading, briefly
touching 1.4770 marks before settling at 1.4820. That still broke
the previous postwar low of 1.4875 set Tuesday.
   The dollar fell against the Swiss currency to close at 1.2435,
below the previous postwar low of 1.2505 also set Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 127.55 Japanese yen from
127.20 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London it rose to 128.15
yen, and in New York at midday the dollar was quoted at 128.85 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9760 from $1.9635 late
Tuesday, and in New York at midday, sterling was quoted at
$1.97035.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
4.9715 French francs, down from 4.9885; 1.6712 Dutch guilders, down
from 1.6768; 1,113.75 Italian lire, down from 1,116.75; 1.1627
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1609.
   Other midday quotes for the dollar in New York included: 1.4843
German marks, 1.2485 Swiss francs, 1,113.35 Italian lire and 1.1618
Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $387.25 a troy ounce,
up from $380.25 late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $386.75, up from
$379.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.51 to close at a bid
$383.64.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.28 a
troy ounce, up from $4.18 bid late Tuesday.

   The stock market fell today in a carryover of
selling from Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 17.08 points on
Tuesday, dropped 28.96 to 2,456.19 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 442 up,

   Analysts said the market appeared to be on hold awaiting the
results of a quarterly offering of bonds and notes by the Treasury,
which began on Tuesday and continues through Thursday.
   The refunding encompasses a record $34.25 billion in securities
with lives ranging from three years to just under 30 years.
   Investor demand for that enormous supply apparently has beenbolstered
by expectations of new moves soon by the Federal Reserve

   Talk has spread in the past week or so that the Fed is worrying
more about countering the effects of recession and less about
combating inflationary pressures.

   A security guard was arrested
today on suspicion of torching the historic Universal Studios
backlot where Warren Beatty flirted with Madonna in ``Dick Tracy.''
   Michael J. Husto, 40, of Tujunga was booked for investigation
of arson and held in lieu of $1 million bail in the
multimillion-dollar fire, said Deputy Rich Erickson of the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   ``He was on duty when the fire started and after questioning he
was arrested early today at the studio,'' the deputy said. ``We
won't disclose a possible motive.''
   Huston is an employee of Burns International Security Services,
which is under contract by Universal. He had been on the job one
month, said Dan Slusser, general manager of Universal City Studios.
   The John Landis movie ``Oscar,'' a production of the Walt Disney
Co. and starring actor Sylvester Stallone, was the only film
shooting on the backlot at the time of the fire, said Slusser.
Actual filming had stopped for the day before the fire began and
Stallone was not present.
   ``We lost the entire set and are going to shut down for a week
to 10 days. We have to build New York Street somewhere,'' said
``Oscar'' publicist Spooky Stevens. ``We also lost 21 vintage cars,
the camera equipment, props, every bit of wardrobe.''
   The blaze damaged the studio tour's King Kong attraction, which
features a 37-foot mechanical gorilla that appears to shake
tramloads of tourists.
   Hundreds of firefighters backed by water-dropping helicopters
put out the windblown flames about three hours after the fire broke
out at the 420-acre studio, Hollywood's biggest and longest-running
movie factory. Universal Studios is visited by millions of tourists
each year.
   ``It roared through the sets like a wildfire. It's like a
blowtorch when the wind pushes the fire up against these
structures,'' said Los Angeles County Battalion Chief Al Bennett.
   Most of the damage was to the sunbaked wooden facades along the
route of the studio tour, the third most popular tourist attraction
in the nation.
   ``A lot of the streets are pretty well destroyed and are going
to have to be rebuilt,'' Bennett said.
   Among outdoor sets destroyed or damaged were New York Street,
where parts of ``The Sting'' were filmed, Brownstone Street, and
Courthouse Square, where Michael J. Fox rode his jet-powered
skateboard in ``Back to the Future Part II.'' The ``Dick Tracy''
set also was gutted, county fire inspector Jim Gandee said.
   But it was ``business as usual'' today with the first tour tram
leaving on schedule at 9:30 a.m., said studio publicist Joan
Bullard. She said about 20 percent of the 420-acre property was
burned and estimated damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   ``We are extremely disappointed to have lost history,'' Bullard
said.
   But she said only one ``attraction,'' or amusement-park-like
feature of the tour, was damaged - King Kong. ``The mechanical part
of that works, but there was water damage and we are checking the
structural integrity of the building,'' Bullard said.
   Fire officials said the earthquake ride also was damaged, but it
worked normally today.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. One firefighter
was slightly injured.
   Studio executives toured the $630 million theme park today to
assess the damage.
   ``Everything looked like charcoal briquets,'' said Rusty
Gilligan, who lives near the back lot. ``It was just a wreck.''
   The flames, fanned by winds gusting up to 50 mph, were doused as
they crept up to two film vaults. The Universal film library, which
includes ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Jaws'' and ``Twins,'' is
worth hundreds of millions.
   The film library is vital to acquisition talks between
Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. and MCA Inc., Universal's
parent. Matsushita has been discussing a multibillion-dollar buyout
of MCA for several months.
   The studio nestled in the Hollywood Hills 10 miles from downtown
Los Angeles features a seven-hour journey through the backlot and
includes a guided tram tour that takes viewers into sets and a
simulated earthquake.
   About 200 Universal employees and about 160 people at two
restaurants on the studio grounds were evacuated after the fire
broke out at 7:18 p.m.
   ``We really had a fire storm. ... It's a miracle that some
firefighters didn't get seriously hurt,'' Freeman said.
   At the nearby Universal Hilton, where the Californian Republican
party had its election night headquarters, traffic tie-ups caused
by the fire prevented some GOP supporters from reaching the hotel.
   The fire is not the first to strike Universal. In 1987, a stage
used for the 1959 epic ``Spartacus'' erupted in flames. Damage was
put at $2.5 million.
   Universal Studios, founded by Carl Laemmle, opened in 1915. It
did not gain recognition until the 1920s, when it produced several
now-classic silent films, including ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
and ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
   Universal is also home to such film classics as ``Psycho,''
``Jaws,'' ``Out of Africa'' and ``To Kill A Mockingbird.''
   Current TV shows shot at Universal include ``Major Dad,''
``Murder She Wrote,'' ``Coach,'' ``Quantum Leap,'' ``Lassie'' and
``Matlock.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rebound on Soviet Buying Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rebounded from eight-month
lows Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation the
Soviet Union is in the market of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal.
Grain futures closed narrowly mixed.
   Soybeans opened slightly higher following news reports the
Soviet Union might have bought 200,000 metric tons of South
American soybean meal earlier in the week.
   Speculation of Soviet interest in U.S. soybeans mounted as
commercial grain dealers, including Cargill Inc., became large
buyers of soybean futures contracts, analysts said.
   Slack export sales of soybeans and soymeal have been factors in
the soybean market's recent decline, which included a drop on
Tuesday to $5.75} a bushel, the lowest daily settlement of a
near-month contract since mid-March.
   Buying interest in soybeans was limited by expectations that the
Agriculture Department will significantly increase its U.S. soybean
crop estimate in a report due Thursday.
   A survey of private grain analysts yielded average estimates of
1.84 billion bushels for the 1990 soybean crop and 7.98 billion
bushels of corn compared with last month's USDA projections of 1.82
billion bushels of soybeans and 8 billion bushels of corn.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent lower to \ cent higher
with the contract for December delivery at $2.65} a bushel; corn
was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.30\ a bushel;
oats were 1 cent higher across the board with December at $1.21 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6\ cents higher with November at
$5.82 a bushel.

   The stock market dropped sharply today,
unsettled by rising oil prices and fears of war in the Middle East.
   Traders in the oil and securities markets appeared to believe
the chances had increased of an outbreak of hostilities in the
Persian Gulf.
   Warnings of war were seen in comments by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain and a confidant of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery jumped more than
$2.50 a barrel, surpassing $35 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Otherwise, analysts said the stock market was on hold awaiting
the full results of a quarterly offering of bonds and notes by the

   Japan's Missho Iwai will sell $52 million
in parts to Tehran for a petrochemical plant abandoned by another
Japanese consortium, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the parts were for the
trouble-ridden Bandar Khomeini petrochemical plant, the largest
project of its kind in the gulf.
   IRNA said Missho Iwai and a number of other Japanese firms are
to grant millions of dollars in credit to Iran in exchange for
exports of liquified natural gas.
   Nissho Iwai will replace all components of the complex destroyed
in the 1980-88 war with Iraq.
   Mitsui, a Japanese consortium, started building the plant in
1974 as a joint project with Iran's state-owned National
Petrochemical Co.
   The complex was 80 percent completed in 1980, but work had to be
stopped due to heavy attacks by Iraqi bombers.
   Mitsui refused to finish the plant after the August 1988
cease-fire on grounds that it was not economically feasible.
   In February, Mitsui paid Iran $900 million to pull out of the
project. The French consortium Technip has been awarded the
contract to finish the project.

   Subsidiaries of German and British
companies are merging their U.S. telephone switching gear
operations to form the third-largest supplier of such equipment in
North America, the companies said Wednesday.
   Siemens AG of Germany and Britain's GPT are negotiating the
merger of their North American public telecommunication equipment
divisions, Siemens Communications Systems and Stromberg-Carlson
Corp., to chase U.S. industry leaders American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. and Northern Telecom.
   GPT is owned jointly by Siemens and General Electric Co. PLC of
Great Britain.
   ``It really does create a company of some merit, some
credentials in the United States, and I think changes the nature of
this whole third-vendor competition,'' said Van Cullens, senior
vice president of marketing and business development for the new
company, Siemens Stromberg-Carlson.
   It may take a month or two for the corporations to sign merger
documents, but he said, ``We're operating on the basis that for
operational purposes and practical purposes it is done.''
   Volker Jung, president and chief executive officer of Boca
Raton-based Siemens Communications, will be the CEO of the merged
companies, they said.
   The new entity will design, develop, produce and sell
computerized public telephone switches, packet switches and
transmission systems, the companies said in a joint news release.
   The majority of the joint venture's 4,000 employees are in
Florida,Arizona, New Mexico and New York. The sales and marketing
staffs of the two companies will be merged.
   Stromberg-Carlson and Siemens Communications have supplied phone
switching systems to several regional U.S. telephone companies.

   Oil prices shot up nearly $3 per barrel
Wednesday after British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned
that war could be near in the Persian Gulf.
   The surge gained momentum when a confidante of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said the countdown for confrontation had
begun, resurrecting anxiety among oil traders that the flow of
petroleum supplies would face disruptions.
   Traders were also responding to reports that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III had given Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an
ultimatum for vacating Kuwait, though Baker denied the reports.
   Light sweet crude closed $2.68 higher at $35.31 per barrel for
December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil had opened 28 cents lower at $32.35 a barrel, then moved ahead
by more than $3 to the day's high of $35.45 before settling back.
   Contracts for delivery in later months all moved higher, many by
the daily limit imposed by the exchange of $1.50 a barrel.
   Mrs. Thatcher's saber-rattling was directed at Saddam and came
as a new session of the Parliament got under way.
   ``The implacable message of this House must be: either he gets
out of Kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by force
and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said. ``He has been warned.''
   ``The market's rallied on Thatcher's comments,'' said Thomas P.
Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.,
in Hoboken, N.J.
   The foreign reports on Baker also pushed up prices, as did the
advance release of an editorial to be published Thursday by Makram
Mohamed Ahmed, editor of the weekly al Mussawar magazine and a
close associate of Mubarak.
   ``It seems like we are now entering the countdown for war which
has become inevitable,'' Ahmed wrote. It was not immediately clear
whether this was his personal interpretation of the crisis or the
view of the Egyptian government.
   Regardless, the escalating words of war on Wednesday injected
new life into a crude market that had been sluggish for more than a
week.
   ``It's the whole rhetoric for the whole day,'' said Brendan
Dolan, a broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It doesn't look
good right now. All signs are pointing to a confrontation.''
   Other traders cited perceptions that any attack involving U.S.
forces would occur after Tuesday's elections.
   Refined petroleum product futures and natural gas also jumped
higher Wednesday.
   Home heating oil shot up 6.33 cents to 92.71 cents a gallon on
December delivery contracts, with all later contracts higher.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 3.44 cents to 91.19 cents a gallon on
December delivery contracts, with all later contracts moving up by
their daily limit of 3 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas for December delivery was up 6.7 cents to $2.45 per
1,000 cubic feet. Most later contracts traded higher.

   USF&amp;G Corp. slashed its dividend and announced
a $75 million cost-cutting program Wednesday on the heels of a $15
million third-quarter loss, a move cited by one analyst as good
news for the diversified financial services company.
   USF&amp;G said it cut its quarterly common stock dividend to 25
cents a share effective Jan. 31, 1991, down from 73 cents a share.
   The company also said its chairman, chief executive and
president, Jack Moseley, 59, was retiring early. A successor for
Moseley, who has served in those posts since 1981, has been found
and will be announced in several weeks, the company said.
   ``The extended duration of the present trough in the property
and casualty market and the economic uncertainty resulting from a
general business downturn required these extraordinary actions,''
the board announced.
   The Baltimore-based company, which focuses on property, casualty
and life insurance, said the moves were designed to conserve
capital and make the company more competitive.
   John Bailey, a stock analyst with the Washington brokerage house
Ferris, Baker Watts, said the dividend cut was expected, but the
austerity program was not.
   ``This is a positive step because it's decisive action to deal
with a difficult situation,'' Bailey said. ``I think the jury is
still out on whether it will be effective.''
   Except for the fourth quarter of 1989, USF&amp;G had not earned
enough to pay its dividend since the beginning of 1989, Bailey
said. That hurt its ability to write new insurance coverage because
it drained capital, he said.
   Insurance premiums move cyclically, with prices declining as
more insurers enter the market and compete for business. Once
prices drop low enough, however, the weaker insurers are weeded out
and prices begin to rise, Bailey said.
   ``USF&amp;G is in a situation that when that upswing in prices
happens, they might not be able to take advantage of it,'' he said.
``With the moves they take today, they improve their position to
take advantage of rising prices.''
   USF&amp;G said it would cut $75 million through layoffs and
attrition at all levels and in all segments. USF&amp;G spokeswoman
Kerrie Burch-DeLuca said layoffs and other cost-cutting measures
would not be announced until after the new chairman takes over.
   For the third quarter, the company said it lost $15 million, or
22 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $17 million, or 25
cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue in the
quarter rose to $1.15 billion from $1.14 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months, USF&amp;G earned $41.0 million, or 35
cents a share, up from $15 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue was $3.42 billion for the first nine months of 1990, from
$3.41 billion a year earlier.
   USF&amp;G reported a $5 million loss in its financial services
segment and a 4.8 percent decline in its equity portfolio, which
comprises 13 percent of its $11.1 billion in invested assets.
   USF&amp;G also said it had put aside $18 million in its real estate
loan loss reserve fund, money used to cover non-performing loans,
compared with $10 million in the same period last year. USF&amp;G,
which has $13.9 billion in total assets, said it has a $1 billion
real estate portfolio, including $490 million in participating
mortgage loans.
   USF&amp;G stock fell 10 percent Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange amid speculation about a dividend cut, closing at $12.25.
It fell again Wednesday, to $11.625.

<HEAD>Polish Tradesmen Get On-The-Job Training in Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Easing Poland's severe housing shortage is the
idea behind a program that sent Polish tradesmen here for hands-on
experience with construction equipment.
   The program, sponsored by the Coca-Cola Co., the AFL-CIO and the
U.S. Labor Department, stems from the government's encouragement of
American efforts to help Eastern Europe shift to a free-market
economy.
   As part of the program, 10 workers from Poland have spent two
months working side-by-side in Chicago with five American experts
in iron-working, bricklaying, carpentry, electrical work and
plumbing.
   They will return to Poland at the end of the week to put their
new skills to work.
   Outside Warsaw, in the small city of Praga, they will teach
their new skills to other laborers at a new center being
established by the Labor Department and the AFL-CIO.
   The center, scheduled to open at the end of the year, will be
outfitted with equipment provided by several U.S. companies.
Coca-Cola is giving $150,000 to pay for the 10 workers' salaries
for two years.
   ``This is important because it will help improve the standard of
living in Poland,'' said Mirek Napiorkowski, a 38-year-old plumber
from the Warsaw area who is participating.
   ``At present some families have waited as long as 30 years for
an apartment,'' Napiorkowski said Wednesday through an interpreter.
   He and eight other workers selected by Poland's Solidarity union
arrived in Chicago in early September, and joined Polish-speaking
American workers selected by unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO.
   They worked on construction projects throughout the Chicago
area, selected as the training site because of its large Polish
population, said Michael Semrau, an assistant vice president at
Coca-Cola.
   Housing is scarce in Poland due to a lack of materials and a
work ethic shaped by nearly 50 years of Communist rule, said Ray
Robertson, general vice president for the Iron Workers union.
   Many families live in cramped flats with relatives, waiting
years for their name to be called from a waiting list for housing,
he said.
   Robertson, who visited Poland in May with union leaders, said
workers there told him their motto had been ``pretend to work for
pretend wages.''
   ``When we were there in May it was like stepping back 45-50
years,'' he said Wednesday. ``There were apartment buildings that
were started in 1981 and still not completed.''
   Many Polish construction practices are considered backward by
American standards, said electrician Ziggy Kaminski, a native Pole
who lives in suburban Chicago and is helping train the visitors.
   Unlike the United States, where electric wiring is hidden inside
narrow pipes installed between walls, ``they have open wiring, just
installed inside the walls, which is unsafe and doesn't look too
good,'' Kaminski said.
   ``A lot of methods (the Poles learned) were completely new to
them,'' he said.
   Also new to the Poles was labor relations, American style.
   ``We feel there is respect among the various trades as well as
between worker and superintendent,'' said Marion Polinski, a
35-year-old Warsaw plumber.
   ``Everyone treats everyone else as a human being, not as number,
therefore it enhances their production,'' Polinski said.
   Semrau said the program also will benefit Coca-Cola by providing
skilled workers for new bottling plants it plans to open in Poland.

<HEAD>Canadian Cabinet Rejects Proposed Settlement of Lobster Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian board on Wednesday rejected a proposal to settle a
free trade dispute between lobstermen in the United States and
Canada.
   Canadian fishermen are allowed to keep and sell smaller lobsters
than their U.S. counterparts. Representatives of the U.S. and
Canadian lobster industries recently had proposed increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along Canada's Atlantic Coast to the
U.S. level of 3\ inches.
   The proposal also called for creating a joint U.S.-Canadian
committee to discuss lobster management issues and for both
countries to work together to promote and market lobsters.
   But on Wednesday, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie announced
in Ottawa that the country's federal cabinet had rejected the
proposed settlement.
   John Kearney, a spokesman for the Maritime Fishermen's Union in
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, hailed the decision.
   ``We have no biological reason in Canada for increasing our
minimum size,'' he said. ``We have a whole range of management and
regulatory measures ... that are non-existent in the United
States.''
   But lobster industry officials from Maine predicted a worsening
of relations between the two countries because of the decision.
   ``For them to pull out of it means there's going to be more
bickering and fighting among all the various factions of the
industry,'' said William Anderson, a lobsterman from Lubec and
chairman of the state's Lobster Advisory Council.
   To U.S. fishermen, the dispute over size is much more than
academic because they compete against Canadian lobstermen who sell
the majority of their catch in the United States.
   ``It's a big deal because so many lobsters fit into that size
range. Lobsters that are just over that (minimum) measure make up
the majority of the catch,'' said David Dow, executive director of
the Maine Lobster Institute, a scientific and educational
organization that fosters cooperation in the lobster industry.
   At the urging of U.S. lobstermen, President Bush signed
legislation last December banning the import of live Canadian
lobsters that are smaller than the minimum U.S. size.
   Ottawa contended the new law violated the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement and would cost the industry $30 million of its $180
million live lobster industry. But an international panel ruled in
late May that the U.S. law did not violate the pact.
   The proposal rejected Wednesday called for increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along Canada's Atlantic Coast to the
U.S. level of 3\ inches from the crustacean's eye socket to the
edge of its body where the tail begins.
   Currently, Canada has a range of minimum sizes from 2{ inches to
3 3-16 inches, depending on where the lobsters are caught.
   Some Canadian lobster industry officials were upset by their
country's decision. The nation's largest lobster exporter,
Clearwater Fine Foods of suburban Bedford, Nova Scotia, has long
supported raising size limits for what it says are conservation
reasons.
   ``There is no competent biologist who advises other than the
desirability of raising size imits,'' company spokesman Doug
Robinson told Canadian Press on Wednesday.
   ``The bottom line is most lobsters now caught are immature. They
have not spawned,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended moderately lower against most
currencies in volatile trading Wednesday, bouncing off early-day
lows with a buying spurt prompted by Middle East saber-rattling.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Currency traders sold aggressively on concerns over a U.S.
economic slump, which led to fears that the Federal Reserve would
move to lower interest rates in order to stimulate business
activity. Lower interest rates generally diminish the value of the
dollar.
   Also pushing the dollar down was news that Democrats gained in
state and congressional elections on Tuesday. Democratic economic
policies are perceived to be more likely to lead to higher
inflation, which erodes purchasing power and could making the
dollar worth less.
   However, heightened fears of war in the Persian Gulf sent the
dollar bouncing back. In some of her strongest remarks of the
3-month-old Iraqi standoff, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher told British lawmakers Iraq will have to be removed
forcefully from Kuwait if it doesn't leave peacefully.
   ``Dealers are still strong believers in the dollar as a refuge
during times of uncertainty,'' said Robert Hatcher, a corporate
dealer at Barclays Bank PLC. ``This market is still very very
uncomfortable selling dollars with a heightened possibility of war
in the Middle East.''
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at
128.73 yen, up from Tuesday's 128.15. In overnight trading in
Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.55 Japanese yen from 127.20 yen late
Tuesday, and in London, it was quoted at 128.15 yen.
   The British pound rose to $1.9690 in New York from $1.9657 late
Tuesday, and in earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.9760
from late Tuesday's $1.9635.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.4874 German marks, down from 1.4927; 1.2485
Swiss francs, down from 1.2545; 4.9870 French francs, down from
5.0055; 1,116.0 Italian lire, down from 1,121.0; and 1.1671
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1630.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 4.9715 French francs, down from 4.9885; 1.6712 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.6768; 1,113.75 Italian lire, down from
1,116.75; 1.1627 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1609.
   Gold moved erratically in domestic trading. It fell 30 cents a
troy ounce to $386.30 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $386.70,
up $1.10.
   Analysts said gold was influenced by internal market
supply-demand factors that pulled it in different directions, after
rising on fears of war escalation in the Middle East.
   In earlier trading in London, gold rose to a late bid price of
$387.25 a troy ounce, up from $380.25 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the
metal rose to a closing bid of $386.75, up from $379.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.51 to close at a bid
$383.64.
   Silver rose on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.267 a troy
ounce, up 3.3 cents. In London, silver bullion rose to a late bid
price of $4.28 a troy ounce, up from $4.18 bid late Tuesday.

   CBS Inc. shares edged higher Wednesday amid
speculation over whether executors of William S. Paley's estate
will decide to sell the late CBS Inc. chairman's 8 percent stake in
the media company.
   But CBS executives and media analysts said even if the stock
were sold, chances were slim it could lead to an unfriendly bid for
control of the company, a frequent subject of takeover rumors.
   The Wall Street Journal reported a sale of the stock seems
likely, partly because the Paley estate, valued at about $500
million, must raise $190 million to cover tax obligations.
   Pat Gallagher, executive director of the William S. Paley
Foundation and one of six executors of the Paley estate, said he
could not confirm the tax liability figure but called suggestions
the stock may be sold ``pure speculation.''
   CBS stock closed up 50 cents at $158.62{ on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday. It traded as high as $162 earlier in the day.
   Paley, longtime chairman of CBS, died last month. Much of his
estate including 1.9 million shares of CBS stock valued at nearly
$300 million is to be divided among his six children.
   But the Journal quoted unidentified people familiar with the
situation as saying the Paley estate's executors may vote next week
on whether to sell the CBS holdings.
   ``We will probably sell that whole block to pay the bills,'' one
of the people, described as knowledgable about the estate's
finances, was quoted as saying in the Journal account.
   Arthur Liman, another executor of the Paley estate, said the
executors have made no decisions on how to handle the estate's tax
liability.
   He said the executors meet regularly, but that no special
meeting has been set yet on what to do with the CBS stock.
   Gallagher noted that the estate also includes numerous other
securities and investments, including artwork and real estate, that
could be used to satisfy any tax obligations.
   CBS spokesman George Schweitzer said even if the stock were
sold, it would not be something that could affect control of CBS.
   CBS president and chief executive Laurence A. Tisch controls
Loews Corp. and its 24.9 percent stake in CBS. That stake, combined
with stock held by employees and investors who support Tisch
effectively blocks any unwelcome bids for control of the company,
media analysts say.
   State takeover laws in New York, where CBS is based, require an
unfriendly bid to win the support of two-thirds of a company's
common stock.
   ``Tisch has de facto control of CBS,'' said John Reidy, who
follows the media business for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Company executives say privately that Tisch is committed to
improving CBS' performance in the primetime television audience
ratings where it trails NBC and he is unlikely to sell - if he ever
does - before accomplishing that.
   The depressed state of media stocks might make them seem
atractive investments. But media analysts say the low stock values
stem from weak advertising revenues and restrictions that limit TV
networks' financial stakes in the programming they carry, making it
an inopportune time for a takeover.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. said Wednesday
its quarterly profit rose 6 percent and credited its move to
diversify beyond military work.
   For the quarter ending Sept. 30, Rockwell said profits were $133
million, or 56 cents per share, on sales of $3.21 billion. That
compares with $126 million, or 50 cents per share, on sales of
$3.27 bilion for the same period last year.
   The company said its electronics business, the company's largest
sector, was driven by commercial orders in the fourth fiscal
quarter.
   The year's results ``confirmed the important shift in Rockwell's
business, with strong contributions coming from our commercial and
international markets and with electronics continuing to be our
largest sector,'' Donald R. eall, chief executive, said in a
statement.
   For the 1990 fiscal year, profits were $624.3 million, or $2.56
per share, down 15 percent from 1989 profits of $734.9 million, or
$2.87 per share. But 1989 profits included a pre-tax gain of $161.5
million from the company's sale of its measurement and flow control
division. Without that gain, 1989 profits were $630.9 million, or
$2.47 per share.
   Sales for fiscal 1990 were $12.3 billion, down 1 percent from
$12.5 billion during fiscal 1989. If the division sale is excluded
from 1989 sales, fiscal 1990 sales rose slightly.
   Rockwell is involved in electronics, aerospace, automotive and
graphics businesses.

   A guard was arrested Wednesday for
allegedly torching the historic Universal Studios backlot, gutting
sets used for ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Back to the Future'' and an
unfinished Sylvester Stallone movie.
   Michael J. Huston, 40, of Tujunga was booked for investigation
of arson and held in lieu of $1 million bail, said sheriff's Deputy
Rich Erickson.
   ``He was on duty when the fire started and after questioning he
was arrested early today at the studio,'' Erickson said.
Authorities refused to disclose a possible motive.
   Huston is an employee of Burns International Security Services,
a New Jersey firm contracted by Universal. He had been on the job
one month, said Dan Slusser, general manager of Universal City
Studios.
   ``We are all saddened as a result of this fire and arrest of one
of our security officers,'' said Burns' Western States president,
William Ewing.
   Damage to the studio, visited by 5.1 million tourists a year,
was expected to be in the millions of dollars, but Slusser said it
would take days to make an assessment.
   MCA Inc., Universal's parent company, said it believes the loss
is fully covered by insurance.
   Although rubble continued to smolder, the studio's popular tram
tour went ahead as scheduled Wednesday morning, a day after the
wind-driven fire.
   Leaving promptly at 9:30 a.m., trams full of visitors toured the
charred remains of the sets from such classic films as ``The
Sting,'' ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' and the ``Back to the Future''
series.
   ``The show must go on. The show will go on,'' said one tour
driver who gave his name only as Larry. ``The idea is to show you
all of our backlot, only a small portion was actually damaged.''
   In fact, the only principal attraction not operating was King
Kong, featuring a fire-belching ape with banana breath.
   Studio officials said the attraction should be reopened in a few
days.
   The John Landis movie ``Oscar,'' a production of the Walt Disney
Co. starring Stallone, had finished filming for the day just hours
before the fire.
   ``We lost the entire set and are going to shut down for a week
to 10 days. We have to build New York Street somewhere,'' said
publicist Spooky Stevens. ``We also lost 21 vintage cars, the
camera equipment, props, every bit of wardrobe.''
   For almost three hours Tuesday night, flames fanned by 50 mph
winds spread through the 75-year-old Hollywood landmark.
Firefighters extinguished the four-acre blaze shortly after 10 p.m.
   Among outdoor sets damaged were New York Street, where parts of
``The Sting'' were filmed, Brownstone Street and Courthouse Square,
where Michael J. Fox rode his jet-powered skateboard in ``Back to
the Future Part II.'' The ``Dick Tracy'' set was gutted, county
fire inspector Jim Gandee said.
   Favorite tour attractions survived, including the simulated
earthquake ride, the shark-snapping Jaws exhibit, the flash flood
area, the parting of the Red Sea, the ice tunnel and the ``Psycho''
house and Bates Motel.
   Also untouched were Colonial Street, where Beaver Cleaver and
Marcus Welby lived, the fictional town of Amity and the area where
``Murder, She Wrote'' is filmed, the Six Points, Texas, Old West
section and Little Europe, where the 1930s film ``Frankenstein''
was filmed.
   The studio nestled in the Hollywood Hills 10 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles features a seven-hour tour through the
backlot.
   The flames were doused as they crept toward two film vaults. The
Universal film library, which includes ``E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Jaws'' and ``Twins,'' is worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   The value of the library is vital to acquisition negotiations
between Japan's Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. and MCA Inc.
Matsushita has been discussing a multibillion-dollar buyout of MCA
for several months.
   One firefighter was slightly injured with face and hand burns.
   The fire was not the first at Universal. In 1987, a stage used
for the 1959 epic ``Spartacus'' ignited, causing $2.5 million in
damage.

   The Eastern Airlines bankruptcy judge
overstepped his authority when he blocked machinists from engaging
in violent and disruptive strike tactics, a federal judge ruled
Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand of Manhattan vacated an
injunction that had barred certain strike activity by the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Sand ruled that the order could have been issued by a federal or
state judge, but not by a bankruptcy judge.
   He said the bankruptcy order violated the 1932 Norris-LaGuardia
Act, which mandates that a party involved in a labor dispute cannot
be granted an injunction until ``reasonable efforts'' are made to
settle differences through mediation or arbitration.
   Eastern filed for voluntary bankruptcy several days after the
machinists' unions went on strike in March 1989.
   The injunction by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland
specifically barred machinists from disrupting Eastern's activities
by shouting, holding mass pickets that blocked traffic, vandalizing
property or assaulting non-union workers.
   ``Nothing in this opinion should be taken to be condonation of
any unlawful acts committed by strikers at different airports
around the United States,'' Sand said in a 23-page decision.
``Eastern is free to seek other forms of remedies in federal court
and all types of relief in state court.''
   Lifland had issued the injunction after holding an extensive
hearing about violent strike tactics at airports in New York and
Georgia.
   At La Guardia Airport in New York, machinists discouraged
passengers from flying with the airline and tried to block
non-union employees from reporting to work, according to the
decision.
   Other strikers flooded bathrooms in the Eastern terminal and
sabotaged luggage conveyer belts with glue, it said.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the airline planned to appeal
Sand's ruling.
   Repeated calls to the union headquarters in Washington were not
answered.

   Northrop Corp. will close its missile plant
in nearby Newbury Park and eliminate 800 jobs, company officials
said Wednesday.
   The work will be transferred to Northrop factories in Hawthorne
and Pico Rivera as part of a company streamlining prompted by
cutbacks in defense spending, said Northrop spokesman Tony
Cantafio.
   ``The company has to be sized right in the current defense
market,'' Cantafio said.
   By the end of next year, the defense contractor will have closed
the 28-year-old Newbury Park plant, a unit of the company's
Aircraft Division, Cantafio said. The 670,000 square-foot plant
about 40 miles west of Los Angeles will be sold.
   ``We eliminate unnecessary duplication of functions and
facilities,'' said Northrop chairman Kent Kresa in a written
statement. ``We improve our ability to develop ... strategies in a
