<HEAD>Study: No Need for Urgent Bypass Surgery in Most Angina Patients</HEAD>

   Men with clogged heart arteries and mild chest
pain can be safely treated with medicines alone, and bypass surgery
does not help them live any longer, a 10-year study concludes.
   The study, released Wednesday, shows that doctors need not rush
to perform this common form of surgery to save the lives of those
with relatively non-severe disease.
   The results are part of the Coronary Artery Surgery Study, an
experiment in which 780 people with chest pain and clogged arteries
were randomly assigned to get bypass surgery or drug treatment.
   Bypass surgery has long been used to relieve angina, the chest
pain that results when the arteries that feed the heart become
plugged with fatty buildups. Surgeons use pieces of vein or artery
to reroute blood around the clogged sections.
   At the time the study began in the mid-1970s, doctors wondered
whether the surgery would improve the outlook of people with bad
arteries who had only mild pain.
   The first data from the study, released five years ago, showed
that people treated with drugs lived just as long as those getting
bypass. And the latest data shows that there is no longer-term
advantage to bypass in these people, either.
   ``It's remarkable that there was no difference in total
survivorship of these patients after 10 years,'' said Dr. Lawrence
S. Cohen of Yale University, a co-author of the study. About 80
percent of both groups were still alive.
   Despite their heart disease, these people's hearts beat
normally. The study showed that bypass does improve lifespan for
those angina victims whose heart's pumping power has been weakened
by heart attacks.
   The results were released at the annual scientific meeting of
the American Heart Association.
   ``It's fair to say it is not necessary to have an intense
movement to surgery. People can watch patients and make judgments
based on a variety of factors,'' commented Dr. William B. Kannel, a
founder of the long-running Framingham Heart Study in suburban
Boston.
   Bypass is one of the most common forms of major surgery in the
United States. An estimated 353,000 of the operations were
performed in 1988.
   Since the study began, the treatment of angina has changed
considerably. Doctors now have a new class of drugs, called calcium
channel blockers, as well as another way of improving the heart's
blood flow, a procedure called angioplasty. In this common
treatment, doctors use balloons to squeeze open the clogged
arteries.
   Angioplasty is less expensive and far easier to recover from
than bypass. New studies are under way to see how the two kinds of
therapy compare over time.
   The new options have given doctors the opportunity to try less
drastic ways of controlling chest pain and reserving bypass surgery
for when these approaches fail.
   ``Most cardiologist would agree that it is possible to control
the symptoms of the vast majority of angina patients medically,''
said Kannel.

<TEXT>
   Bernardo Bertolucci admits putting his cast and
crew through an ordeal to make ``The Sheltering Sky,'' a film about
an American couple seeking to revive their marriage deep in the
Sahara.
   The film was to have a gala premiere tonight at the year-old
Opera-Bastille.
   Based on Paul Bowles' best-selling novel by the same name, the
film stars Debra Winger and John Malkovich as Kit and Port Moresby,
sophisticated New York artists who go into the African desert to
save their failing marriage.
   It is due to open in the United States in mid-December.
   Bertolucci told reporters after an advance screening Wednesday
that the cast and crew of 120 battled desert heat and flooding
caused by the first rains in the region in two years.
   The storms swept away roads and bridges, stranding equipment
trucks, the cast, crew and even Bertolucci himself.
   ``It was a hard movie to make. The sweat isn't makeup, it's real
sweat,'' he said. ``The dust is real dust and the flies are real
flies.''
   Ms. Winger said filming on location in the desert added a
special quality to the movie.
   ``I had always felt a pull to the desert, whether in south
western United States or the Negev,'' Ms. Winger said. ``But the
Sahara was really something different, it was much rougher than I
expected.''
   She said she was unable to return to the United States when
filming ended last January. Instead, she put a pack on her back and
traveled through Niger for three weeks.
   ``Only then could I face coming home. I had the desert inside of
me,'' she said.
   Bertolucci said he was attracted to ``The Sheltering Sky,''
which became something of a cult book when published in 1949,
because ``after `The Last Emperor,' I was really interested in
doing something that didn't have a lot of actors and a lot of
costumes.''
   He cast Bowles in a small role in the film.
   Its exotic locations included the dusty, mud-built town of
Agadez, Niger. Fifty Tuareg tribesmen, nomads who spend their lives
in constant search of water and pasturage, traveled 3,000 miles to
be cast as extras.
   Most of them had never seen a camera or automobile and were not
able to digest the production's butter and mayonnaise-smeared
sandwiches.
   Despite the exotic landscape, Malkovich said ``The Sheltering
Sky'' involved common themes.
   ``The film is set in a different place, in a different time, yet
it's a common story of the human condition in terms of the way
people live,'' he said.
   When the book was published, Bertolucci recalled, ``Bowles said
Kit and Port were a couple from the future. But their malaise is
something very modern, it's something I see around me all the
time.''
   ``The film is not about the impossibility of love - they love
each other deeply - rather it's about the impossibility of finding
happiness inside a love relationship,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake centered off
Indonesia's Sumatra island shook much of southern Thailand on
Thursday but there were no reports of damage or injuries,
Thailand's Meteorological Department said.
   The quake measured 6.0 on the Richter scale and was centered in
the Andaman Sea abut 410 miles southwest of Thailand's southern
island of Phuket, the department said.
   It said it had received reports that tremors were felt in
high-rise buildings in Phuket and nearby Songkhla province as well
as in Bangkok.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater. A magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas,
while a magnitude 7 can inflict widespread, heavy damage.

<HEAD>Treaty to Cut European Weapons Still Unfinished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next Monday, in a glittering ceremony in
Paris, the United States, the Soviet Union and their military
allies plan to sign the most sweeping agreement in history to
reduce weapons arsenals.
   But the treaty to slash arms across the vast expanse of Europe -
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union -
is simply not ready.
   Confident Bush administration officials, only four days short of
the deadline, expect to have all the details cleared up in time.
And yet, they have been flashing the same confidence for months -
and come up short.
   Some of the unresolved issues are technical and a few are more
than that. For instance, officials still have not agreed on how to
verify that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw
Pact eliminate the tanks, anti-aircraft artillery and other
non-nuclear arms they have agreed to junk in the interest of a
calmer Europe.
   Also not settled is how much the hard-pressed Soviets will pay
to melt down tanks and inspect stockpile reductions.
   ``They are up against the wall financially,'' a sympathetic U.S.
official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``I don't see a
big problem out there.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was unable to
say how the verification issues would be resolved by the time
President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the
leaders of the 15 other NATO and five other Warsaw Pact nations
sign the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement.
   Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III left his senior
arms control experts behind in Moscow when he could not crack the
final issues with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Those experts managed to clear up differences over the aircraft
to be eliminated.
   But verification problems still hang over the Paris ceremony.
Also, even though Baker worked out with Shevardnadze new figures
for the number of tanks and other non-nuclear weapons to be left on
the flanks of Europe, the terms still must be ratified by Turkey
and Norway.
   The last-minute shift in weapons quotas for the outermost of the
four European zones is based on a reduction of tensions in Germany.
Once considered the likeliest flashpoint, the region now is
basically serene. East Germany, the staunchest Soviet ally, has
merged with West Germany.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, gave way to pressure from their own
allies last week and agreed they could have larger quotas of the
arms permitted the Warsaw Pact under the treaty.
   The differences are minor. For instance, the Soviets now will
have 13,150 tanks instead of 13,300.
   This pleases the Bush administration because it considers
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania unlikely to
fight alongside the Soviets in the now-remote possibility of war.
   U.S. officials are remarkably serene in their confidence the
treaty will be ready by Monday. ``Basically, it's buttoned up. It's
going to be signed,'' an official said.
   Also due for signing by the members of the two alliances is a
non-aggression declaration. It ``will, in a sense, bury the Cold
War hatchet,'' Baker said at a White House news conference
Wednesday.
   Far from complete, meanwhile, is another treaty that was
destined for signing at a U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow next month.
That one would reduce the two superpowers' long-range nuclear
bombers, missiles and submarines by about 30 percent.
   Bush had hoped to sign the accord with Gorbachev, but there
seems to be no hope remaining for an accord by year's end.
   Baker and Shevardnadze, and their arms control experts, have
been unable to resolve three major issues.
   They are:
   -The kinds of testing and other restrictions to impose on the
154 heavy, ground-based SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles
the Soviet will retain under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against numerical weapons limits established in
the treaty.
   -The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies. This issue primarily
concerns arms Washington would like to turn over to Britain outside
the treaty's limits.

   To celebrate the 300th anniversary of
newspaper journalism in America, historians took a look at this
country's first newspapers and found them to be bad role models:
elitist, racist, venomous, biased and worshipful of kings.
   ``Outrageously partisan,'' is how David Paul Nord, associate
professor of journalism at Indiana University, characterized them
at a day-long discussion on the roots of the American press
Wednesday.
   And troublemaking. When the people of this continent looked for
``treason, sedition, fragmentation, dissension, disintegration,
degeneration, disunion, anarchy or chaos,'' he said, ``they usually
saw it first in the newspaper.''
   He said the New York Evening Post, forerunner of today's New
York Post, was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton's faction of
the Federalist Party for a single purpose: to destroy Thomas
Jefferson, who won the presidency in the election of 1800.
   ``If that purpose required the editor to vilify his party's
opponents as liars and traitors, to attack the president as a moral
degenerate with a slave harem, or to shoot a Republican dead in the
street in a duel, so be it,'' said Nord. ``That was what newspaper
work was all about in 1801.''
   Moreover, said historian Charles E. Clark of the University of
New Hampshire, the earliest newspapers, written for the elite by
elitists, shared some assumptions that were far from democratic.
   They believed, he said, in the superiority of the white race
over the colored races; of the English over other nationalities,
especially the French; of Protestantism over Catholicism; in
capital punishment and in ``male governance of the family as
necessary for effective social order.'' And, ``they adored the
king.''
   The session, for scholars and journalists, was sponsored by the
Gannett Foundation and the American Antiquarian Society to
commemorate the appearance of the first American newspaper,
``Publick Occurrences, Both Forreign and Domestick.''
   It was issued in Boston by printer Benjamin Harris on Sept. 25,
1690, eight decades before the American Revolution.
   Publick Occurrences promised to come out once a month ``or, if
any glut of occurrences happen, oftener,'' but didn't live up to
the promise. Issue No. 1 was the last. The authorities of
Massachusetts colony suppressed it as unlicnsed, printed ``without
the least privity or countenance of authority.''
   What's more, they said, it contained ``sundry doubtful and
uncertain reports.'' No more newspapers were published here until
1704.
   For all the early press' weaknesses, two contemporary
journalists - author Patricia O'Brien, former political
correspondent for Knight-Ridder Newspapers, and Les Payne,
assistant managing editor at Newsday - found some useful linkages
between early and contemporary journalism.
   Ms. O'Brien said Benjamin Harris could serve as a model because
of his ``audacity'' in printing without government permission in
the first place and his ``lack of reliance on official sources,'' a
lack she said barely exists in Washington journalism today.
   Payne said journalists always have liked to say their mission is
``to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,'' but it
isn't necessarily so.
   He said newspapers in the 18th century and those published today
have in common a tendency ``to comfort the comfortable and ignore
the afflicted.''

<HEAD>Democrats: Give Sanctions Up to 18 Months Before Military
Offensive</HEAD>

   Congressional Democrats are counseling
President Bush to give international sanctions against Iraq as much
as 18 months to take effect before considering military moves in
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   At a White House meeting Wednesday, House Speaker Thomas Foley
and others asked Bush to be patient. Foley suggested that the
economic embargo may take many months longer to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, according to a senior congressional source.
   Afterward, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., issued
a statement calling for ``a policy of patient strength, permitting
the economic sanctions ... to work.''
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said, ``I'm terribly worried about
the direction they're going'' in the administration.
   The sanctions were imposed with broad international support
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. They have largely shut
down commerce in food, oil, weaponry and other goods.
   In separate closed-door briefings, senators and House members
heard from Secretary of State James A. Baker III and from Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney. But some left with fears the administration
is edging ever closer to war.
   Rep. David Obey, who attended the White House meeting, said,
``I'm pessimistic about the possibility of avoiding war, based on
the tone of conversation coming from administration officials.''
   ``If we're going to be the champions of impatience, we're going
to send our kids into a lot of bloody battles,'' Obey, D-Wis.,
added.
   Sen. Wendell Ford of Kentucky, the newly elected No. 2
Democratic leader in the Senate, said war would only split America
apart. ``I think there's no question about it. This is not a
Grenada or a Panama. It's a Vietnam with sand.''
   Ford added: ``I would prefer to let (the sanctions) run for a
year and win without bloodshed.''
   Baker said the sanctions ``are beginning to bite.'' But asked
whether they would be enough to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, he answered, ``I don't think we
can say that today with certainty.''
   Analysts say Iraq's civilian factory production has been sharply
curtailed and some food shortages are occurring, but sanctions have
been slow to affect the military. They point out that Iraqis,
having just lived through an eight-year war with Iran, are used to
finding substitutes for goods in short supply and making do
without.
   Following the briefing by Baker and Cheney, Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., said the embargo appears to be holding but is taking
longer than expected to show signs of impact.
   ``The embargo is not a quick solution,'' Sasser said. ``My
counsel is patience, that we continue the sanctions with the full
realization that it may take months, perhaps even a period of a
year or two.''
   But some Republicans balked at such a long commitment, saying
Americans would have no patience for leaving troops in place
through 1991.
   That is ``far beyond the time frame I thought appropriate,''
said House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. Such a long
wait would require ``shoring up the American public's attitude''
toward the gulf deployment.
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas added: ``If the American
people are frustrated already, after three-plus ... months, what
are they going to be a year from now?''
   Michel said Bush justified his latest military buildup - the
near-doubling of the U.S. force in the gulf region - by pointing to
Saddam's potential stranglehold on oil and on the economies of many
nations.
   Bush told the lawmakers that ``we haven't crossed any particular
Rubicon here'' with the latest troop deployment, Michel said,
reading from his notes of the meeting.
   ``This was no petty aggression on the part of Saddam Hussein,''
Bush told congressional leaders. ``If we don't take heed now, we'll
pay dearly later.''
   The administration and Congress also clashed over the
president's obligation to seek permission before undertaking any
offensive military moves. Lawmakers reiterated their constitutional
right to declare war. Baker said Bush would follow the
Constitution, but pointedly added, ``It's a question of what the
Constitution requires.''
   With House and Senate hearings on gulf policy scheduled as early
as next week, the idea of calling Congress back into an emergency
session appeared to have fallen from favor.
   Meanwhile, a nationwide poll of 1,020 Americans that was
commissioned by arms control advocates found that most oppose going
to war with Iraq even if the standoff continues early next year.
   The poll, conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.,
said 44 percent favor continuing the sanctions and 14 percent want
U.S. troops withdrawn from Saudi Arabia. An additional 30 percent
would choose war, but only if allies and the United Nations
approved first; and 8 percent chose war even without approval.
   The poll, financed by the Professionals' Coalition for Nuclear
Arms Control, was conducted Friday through Tuesday and had a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher set off to a
European summit in Rome last month, it looked like business as
usual: another spat with the continentals, more ``Maggie Isolated''
headlines, and home.
   But the Oct. 27 meeting of the European Community leaders was
for Mrs. Thatcher the crest of a slippery slope, and provoked the
most serious challenge to her leadership through 11 years in power.
   Now Mrs. Thatcher is fighting for her political survival.
   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine announced Wednesday
that he will challenge her on Tuesday for the leadership of the
Conservative Party and the prime ministership.
   Things of course had not gone that wrong that quickly for the
Iron Lady.
   The crisis is a culmination of economic troubles at home and a
questioning of what was once a major Thatcher asset - the gritty
nationalism she calls ``batting for Britain.''
   Mrs. Thatcher returned from Rome in a feisty mood, saying the 11
other leaders were living in ``cloud cuckoo land'' for agreeing to
set up a single currency, perhaps by the year 2000.
   It is a move she rejects as undermining national sovereignty and
leading to a federal United States of Europe.
   ``No, no, no!'' she shouted Oct. 30 in the House of Commons
about proposals for greater political union of the 12-nation
community.
   Two days later, her deputy prime minister Sir Geoffrey Howe,
veteran of more than 30 summit meetings by her side, resigned.
   He said he could take it no longer.
   As Thatcher loyalists waited with trepidation for Howe to
elaborate, the Tories were driven into a humiliating third place in
a special parliamentary election in the northern city of Bradford.
   Bradford, which the Tories had held since 1983, was the latest
in a string of electoral drubbings. It came just weeks after the
Conservatives lost a previously safe south England district,
Eastbourne.
   Then on Tuesday, Howe unleashed one of the most scathing attacks
ever delivered on a British prime minister by a senior colleague.
   He accused Mrs. Thatcher of creating a ``nightmare image'' of
Britain's European partners, and said life in her 22-member Cabinet
was an intolerable struggle between loyalty to her and to Britain's
interests in the European Community.
   ``The time has come for others to consider their own response to
the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I have myself wrestled
for perhaps too long,'' Howe said.
   The Howe move tipped Heseltine into the challenge.
   He is the first political heavyweight to run against Mrs.
Thatcher since she became party leader in 1975. She led the Tories
from opposition to government in 1979 and on to two more election
victories.
   Europe was the catalyst.
   But when did things really start to go wrong? Was it last year
when she sacked Howe as foreign secretary, leaving him to brood
with a big title and no apparent job?
   Or in October 1987 when the government, fearful of a post-Black
Monday recession, sparked a credit boom and set off inflation with
lower interest rates?
   Or was it, as Howe claims, Mrs. Thatcher's refusal five years
ago to link the pound to Europe's other major currencies as a curb
on inflation?
   At the root of the Thatcher crisis is the sense that her
free-market revolution isn't working any more, and disaffection in
a party facing the prospect of defeat by the revamped Labor Party
at the next general election. It must be held by mid-1992.
   Inflation, the ill Mrs. Thatcher set out to conquer with her
austere economic policies, is at nearly 11 percent while high
interest rates persist. For 16 months the Tories have trailed Labor
in polls.
   The prime minister is also being blamed for a major vote-loser,
a new per capita local government tax - known as the poll tax -
which Heseltine has promised to review.
   Heseltine claims more than 100 sure votes from among the 372
Conservative legislators who elect the party leader. Thatcher's
campaigners say she'll roll up the 214 votes needed for an outright
win on the first ballot and more.
   But nobody knows. And a second ballot Nov. 27 would attract more
contenders, possibly from within the Cabinet, shattering what unity
is left and deeply wounding Mrs. Thatcher even if she survives.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of this year's Thanksgiving
proclamation issued Wednesday by President Bush.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the first Presidential Thanksgiving Day proclamation, George
Washington observed that ``it is the Duty of all Nations to
acknowledge the Providence of Almighty God, to obey his Will, to be
grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and
favor.'' As a people who have long enjoyed unparalleled material
prosperity and the priceless blessings of peace and freedom, we
Americans cannot fail to fulfill this great, yet joyous, duty.
Thus, we pause each year on Thanksgiving Day to express our
gratitude for the goodness and generosity of our Creator and to ask
His continued protection and guidance in all our endeavors, both as
individuals and as a nation.
   The observance of Thanksgiving was a cherished tradition in
America long before George Washington called his countrymen ``to
the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent
Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.''
Indeed, we trade the tradition of giving thanks back to some of the
earliest settlers in this country - not only the Pilgrims at
Plymouth but also early colonists at Jamestown, New Amsterdam, and
St. Augustine. With hands clasped in prayer and hearts full of
gratitude, these men and women gave public thanks to God for having
been sustained through times of hardship and peril.
   William Bradford's account of the experience of the settlers at
Plymouth Colony is not only a moving description of the trials of
emigration to a wilderness but also captures their profound faith
and contains a timeless exhortation to succeeding generations:
   ``Being thus passed the vast ocean ... they had now no friends
to welcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their
weatherbeaten bodies, no houses or much less towns to repair to ...
And for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters of
that country know them to be sharp and violent ... Besides, what
could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness? ... Neither
could they, as it were, go to the top of Pisgah, to view from this
wilderness a more goodly country to feed their hopes, for which way
soever they turned their eyes (save upwards to the heavens) they
could have little solace or content ... What could now sustain them
but the spirit of God and His grace? They cried to the Lord, and He
heard their voice, and looked on their adversity. Let them
therefore praise the Lord, because He is good, and His mercies
endure forever.''
   The historic observance of a day of thanksgiving at Plymouth in
1621 was one of many occasions on which our ancestors paused to
acknowledge their dependence on the mercy and favor of Divine
Providence. Today, on this Thanksgiving Day, likewise observed
during a season of celebration and harvest, we have added cause for
rejoicing: the seeds of democratic thought sown on these shores
continue to take took around the world. In Central and Eastern
Europe, in Latin America, and elsewhere, courageous men and women
are beginning to reap the blessings of freedom and self-government.
Peoples who once suffered under the heavy yoke of totalitarianism
have begun to claim the liberty to which all are heirs.
   Our gratitude for the rights and opportunities we enjoy as
Americans may be measured by how carefully we use the preserve
these gifts, as when we cultivate in our children a love of freedom
and an understanding of the responsibilities that freedom demands
of us. We tend the precious blossom of our liberty when we recall
the example of our ancestors and strive to ensure that our own
lives are firmly rooted in faith. Like our forebears, we must
cherish the values and beliefs that are the foundation of strong,
loving families and caring communities and recognize the importance
of learning and hard work, because these are the wellspring of
progress and prosperity.
   The great freedom and prosperity with which we have been blessed
is cause for rejoicing - and it is equally a responsibility.
Indeed, Scripture tells us that much will be asked of those to whom
much has been given. Our ``errand in the wilderness,'' begun more
than 350 years ago, is not yet complete. Abroad, we are working
toward a new partnership of nations. At home, we seek lasting
solutions to the problems facing our nation and pray for a society
``with liberty and justice for all,'' the alleviation of want, and
the restoration of hope to all our people.
   This Thanksgiving, as we enjoy the company of family and
friends, let us gratefully turn our hears to God, the loving Source
of all Life and Liberty. Let us seek His forgiveness for our
shortcomings and transgressions and renew our determination to
remain a people worthy of His continued favor and protection.
Acknowledging our dependence on the Almighty, obeying His
Commandments, and reaching out to help those who do not share fully
in this nation's bounty is the most heartfelt and meaningful answer
we can give the timeless appeal of the Psalmist: ``O give thanks to
the Lord for He is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.''
   Finally, on this Thanksgiving Day, let us also remember all
those Americans abroad who labor to advance the ideals for which
this great nation stands. Whether Peace Corps volunteers or
military or diplomatic personnel, these selfless individuals often
accept great personal risks and sacrifices to serve our country.
Let us remember, in particular, those Americans held hostage and
members of the Armed Forces serving in the Persian Gulf region. On
this day, let us pray for their well-being and their safe return to
the United States. And let us be thankful that such fine men and
women are still willing to answer the call of duty to country and
to defend the cause of liberty.
   NOW, THEREFORE, I, George Bush, President of the United States
of America, do hereby call upon the American people to observe
Thursday, November 22, 1990, as a National Day of Thanksgiving and
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many
blessings God has bestowed upon us.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set by hand this fourteenth
day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the
two hundred and fifteenth.

<HEAD>Teacher Gets 20 Years For Molesting Boys</HEAD>

   A 63-year-old former teacher accused of
molesting two generations of his male students drew 20 years in
prison and a $25,000 fine.
   Douglas Marks, who was sentenced Wednesday, had pleaded guilty
to molesting four elementary school boys between 1985 and 1989. The
fathers of two of those boys said they, too, had been victims of
Marks years ago.
   Court records cited 22 instances of molestation dating to 1956,
most too old to prosecute. Prosecutor Richard Llewellyn said he has
found 45 victims.
   ``Last week I spared you a mini-trial. I can't spare you any
longer,'' Judge Frank Davis said. At a hearing last week, the judge
refused to let some of Marks' victims testify, saying, ``I wasn't
going to embarrass this poor man any more.''
   The former teacher is a member of a prominent local family that
owns substantial ranch property and a sawmill. About 40 people
watched the sentencing, including Marks' brother, former speaker of
the Montana House Bob Marks.
   Marks had built a reputation as a devoted and selfless teacher
in Boulder, though questions about his behavior were raised as long
ago as 1959.
   He was forced to resign a high school post that year after three
boys said he molested them. He later taught at nearby Clancy and
returned to Boulder in 1965 at an elementary school. He resigned
after the latest charges surfaced.
   The onetime student whose tip led to the educator's prosecution
said he was satisfied with Marks' punishment. Paul Myrhow, 24, was
molested by Marks in 1980 and reported him five years later. It was
only last year that Marks was charged.
   ``I'm not pleased that the delays took place,'' Myrhow said,
``but I am very pleased with today's results. I think they're
fair.''
   Myrhow said he felt some townspeople knew Marks was molesting
students and did little or nothing to prevent it, but that he
wasn't bitter about the handling of the case.
   ``I have to live in that town,'' he said. ``I spend a lot of
time there and have a lot of friends.''
   Marks should be eligible for parole in about five years,
Llewellyn said. While on parole, he will be forbidden from contact
with anyone under 18.
   The fine will pay for counseling for Marks' victims and other
young people involved in sex crimes.

<HEAD>Scientists Find First Biological Abnormality in Brains of
Hyperactives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported finding what may be the
best evidence yet that an abnormality in the brain causes
hyperactivity, an inability to pay attention, sit still and behave.
   The study found it may be hard for hyperactive people to
concentrate because the parts of their brains that control
attention don't work as hard as normal.
   ``This is the first large study of hyperactivity that shows some
sort of metabolic abnormality,'' said Dr. Alan J. Zametkin, who
directed the research at the National Institute of Mental Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   Brain scans of adults afflicted with the disorder since
childhood showed that their brain cells were 8 percent less active
than those of normal people. The reduction was especially dramatic
in the parts of the brain that control attention and inhibit
behavior.
   Hyperactivity, known technically as attention
deficit-hyperactivity disorder, is the most common mental illness
of childhood, afflicting 2 percent to 4 percent of school-age
children.
   The disorder makes children inattentive and impulsive. They tend
to blurt out answers in school, run into the street without looking
and fidget, squirm and jump about. Their hot tempers and
disobedience make them difficult for parents and teachers to
handle.
   About half the time, the disorder persists into adulthood, and
victims are more likely to have run-ins with the law and abuse
drugs and alcohol.
   About three-quarters of victims improve when given mild
stimulant drugs, such as Ritalin, that help them concentrate. Just
why these medicines work is unclear.
   Zametkin said he hoped the latest findings will reduce the
stigma attached to being treated for this disorder by showing that
it involves a biological abnormality.
   His research, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, was conducted on 25 adults who had been hyperactive since
childhood. They were also parents of hyperactive youngsters.
   The researchers compared the metabolism - the rate at which
energy is used - in the brains of the hyperactive adults and 50
normal people. They found that brain activity was significantly
lower among hyperactives in 30 of 60 regions of the brain.
   In particular, they noticed reductions in the premotor cortex
and the superior prefrontal cortex. These parts of the brain
control attention. Damage to them can result in distractibility,
inattention and difficulty controlling inappropriate behavior.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gabrielle Weiss of Montreal
Children's Hospital said the findings ``represent a clear advance
in our understanding'' of hyperactivity. But whether low metabolism
is the ultimate cause of hyperactivity is still unclear.
   ``I'm not going to say it's the cause,'' said Zametkin. ``We
have to look at young kids and people with the non-genetic form of
the disorder. But it's possible this has something to do with the
cause.''
   Dr. Paul H. Wender of the University of Utah said a biological
abnormality may not turn out to be the basic cause of
hyperactivity. Instead, the cortex may be sluggish because of
faulty control signals from a more primitive part of the brain.
   ``If the more primitive centers don't tell the guys upstairs to
wake up, they won't have attention,'' he said. ``But the problem is
not in the cortex. It's the guys downstairs.''

<HEAD>U.S. Negotiators to Push Limited Mining Moratorium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they will oppose a proposal
to make Antarctica a world park permanently off limits to mining,
urging instead a limited moratorium on oil drilling and other
minerals development.
   The issue will be debated at talks opening Monday in Santiago,
Chile, among the 24 countries with voting rights under the 1959
Antarctica Treaty.
   Environmental activists said they regretted the U.S. decision to
line up against the world park idea backed by France, Australia and
New Zealand.
   The head of the U.S. delegation, Assistant Secretary of State
E.U. Curtis Bohlen, said Wednesday that a long-term moratorium was
the ``likely middle ground'' between those nations wanting to block
mining forever and those, like the United States, unwilling to rule
it out.
   ``At the moment we have no legally binding controls,'' Bohlen
said in a telephone interview. ``A legally binding moratorium of 30
years is clearly a big step forward.''
   Will Martin, director of the Wilderness Society's Antarctica
project, said the United States should be seeking the greatest
possible protection for Antarctica, a frozen but fragile continent
larger than the United States and Mexico put together.
   ``The proposal for a 30-year moratorium would appear to be in
favor of the Antarctic environment, but when you examine the
proposal it turns out to be footdragging rather than leadership,''
Martin said.
   The Antarctica Treaty nations held a minerals convention in
Wellington, New Zealand, in 1988, aiming to impose international
controls on any prospecting and development.
   But opinion turned against the Wellington convention, which
environmentalists argued would encourage mining. Australia and
France led a campaign for a permanent ban on minerals development
instead.
   Just before adjourning last month, Congress passed two bills
opposing any minerals development in Antarctica. President Bush has
not said whether he will sign them.
   The Interior Department prefers a moratorium as short as five
years and has urged Bush to veto the legislation, department
spokesman Steve Goldstein said.
   ``We have environmental and national security concerns,''
Goldstein said. ``If we sign a moratorium for a longer length of
time, then that could hamper us in our work with other countries.''
   Because of the huge expense of operating in Antarctica, minerals
development is not expected to be worth the effort for decades to
come. It is not even clear how much oil, precious metals or other
minerals might be found there.
   A key issue in Santiago is likely to be what happens once a
moratorium ends.
   Bruce Manheim, a lawyer and scientist with the New York-based
Environmental Defense Fund, said he hoped the countries will not
approve ``a road map to development that kicks in after 30 years.''
   Some nations, he said, were likely to propose that a moratorium
be extended automatically unless all the treaty members agree to
lift it. Manheim is a member of the U.S. delegation for the talks
opening Monday.
   The 24 nations that are consultative parties to the treaty with
voting rights are Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Belgium, Britain,
Chile, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, South
Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, South Africa, the Soviet
Union, Spain, Sweden, the United States and Uruguay.

<TEXT>
   Almost everything is secret in Iraq today,
including the rain.
   Weather forecasts are not reported on the grounds they could be
helpful to the U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   It was the same during the 1980-88 war with Iran.
   Telephone directories, never exactly widely distributed, are now
highly prized because they too are restricted.
   You can't buy a street map of Badgdad, a city of 4.5 million
people, because they could help enemy agents find their way around
on sabotage missions.
   Importing typewriters - if you can get around the U.N. embargo -
is banned because the Iraqis consider they can be used for
subversive purposes.
   Saddam Hussein, a life-long conspirator, knows that well. He
used to hammer out propaganda tracts in his younger days when he
was underground with the Baath Arab Socialist Party, which was
outlawed at the time.
   To import a typewriter means going through the time-consuming
process of getting a security police permit, which are about as
rare as gold dust.
   Residents can't even get a duplicate key of their apartment made
without permission from local authorities.
   Stationary stores with photocopying machines display a list of
items people can't copy - personal identification documents,
military papers, military identification cards, school examination
questions and passports.

   Saddam is omnipresent as president of Iraq, chairman of the
ruling Revolutionary Command Council, secretary-general of the
ruling Baath Socialist Party, field marshal and commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, latter-day Nebuchadnezzar, and in his latest
official metamorphosis, a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed.
   His face peers from wristwatches, cigarette lighters and badges
worn by top Baath Party members.
   His photos are everywhere - in homes, offices, restaurants,
hotels and shops as well as in every issue of The Baghdad Observer,
the English language daily.
   At the telephone center, posters of Saddam show him speaking on
a phone. Outside the Teachers' Union office, he's pictured sitting
behind a desk writing.

   Getting an entry visa to Iraq was difficult even during the best
of times. These days it's even harder. But getting out can be even
more problematic, as the hundreds of Western hostages held in Iraq
well know.
   No one can leave the country unless they have an exit visa,
possibly the most prized possession in Iraq today.
   At the airport, travel papers and passports are scrutinized at
five different points by stern-faced secret police agents and
immigration officials.
   On the Iraqi Airways flight to Amman in neighboring Jordan, a
half-dozen armed sky marshals constantly give passengers the
once-over.

   The Iraqi authorities are obsessive about security and secrecy.
Wiretapping is pervasive. Hotel rooms are bugged. People talk in
whispers when they discuss politics or the Persian Gulf crisis.
   It is an accepted fact that foreigners' telephones are tapped.
Lines are disconnected if people talk in a language the
eavesdroppers don't understood.
   When a reporter called his home in India and started speaking in
Bengali with his wife, the line went dead. There are no Bengali
interpreters in Baghdad.
   On Fridays, the Moslem Sabbath, international calls are
restricted to 10 minutes because there are not enough people to tap
all the calls.

   Iraqis are encouraged to spy on each other. Schoolchildren are
even urged to tell what their parents say at home.
   As Iraqis tell it, two officials spotted each other dining with
western reporters in one of the fish restaurants along the banks of
the Tigris River that flows through Baghdad.
   Both dutifully reported the fact to the Al-Amn, the secret
police. Both were promptly transferred to remote towns.

   Baghdad taxi drivers with foreign passengers are required to
report their movements, listing how long they stayed at each stop.
   One cabbie working for a U.S. television network was kept in a
security police lockup for three nights after someone reported that
he'd taken a camera crew without an Iraqi official guide.
   No taxi can go to the airport with journalists unless they have
written approval or are accompanied by an Iraqi official.
   Most journalists covering news conferences or official functions
form a ``delegation'' and travel in a group.
   ``Why you are not in delegation?'' reporters are asked if they
insist on trying to see a government official on their own.

   It used to be that couples striving for
parenthood said so with a blush and a demure ``We're trying.'' Now
three Iowa couples are forgoing such niceties in a radio contest to
see who conceives first.
   ``It's not really anything different than what other people do,
it's just that we're telling the whole world that we're trying to
have kids,'' said Roger Fouche.
   Fouche is one of three husbands entered in the Breeders Cup
contest sponsored by KRNQ-FM, which has offered prizes to the first
couple to conceive. A similar competition is being run by a radio
station in Pensacola, Fla.
   The Iowa contestants' efforts are being performed behind closed
doors, thank goodness. But every Friday morning the couples go on
the air to talk about their experiences, and the women take
pregnancy tests at the station.
   When a pregnancy is confirmed by a doctor, the winner will
receive a $1,000 savings bond, six months' diaper service and a
crib.
   ``We had been trying for about five months, so we figured we
might as well win some prizes while we're trying,'' said Fouche's
wife, Ann, 27.
   ``I called my dad. He's from Illinois. He thought it was a riot.
My in-laws got into town, they were gone over the weekend, and
their best friends handed them the newspaper article. They were
shocked. Everyone's found out one way or another.
   ``It's the non-traditional way.''
   The Breeders Cup kicked off last Friday. Each woman took a
pregnancy test in the morning and the couples all had a free stay
in a hotel that night.
   ``The whole thing started when the morning guys started talking
about Connie Chung,'' said Scott Schubert, KRNQ sales manager. ``We
thought, why not have a contest to see who can beat Connie Chung.''
   The CBS newswoman said earlier this year she was cutting back
her on-air duties to concentrate on getting pregnant.
   The Breeders Cup was open to married couples without children.
Nearly 20 applied. The Fouches, who live in Des Moines, Lisa and
James Machamer of Des Moines, and Wayne and Colleen Tendall of
Johnston were chosen by lots.
   ``I wanted something that was just kind of wacky,'' said
Machamer, 22. We've been trying for five, six months now. Not that
it will spur us on or anything, I just thought it would be fun.''
   Fouche, 27, said he's not embarrassed to talk about his efforts.
   ``I don't know if we really get into sex habits, but if you're
having kids or want kids, you're obviously having sex,'' he said.
   Asked if the contest has made any difference in his ``trying,''
Fouche said, ``Things have definitely improved.''
   In Florida two weeks ago, WTKX-FM said it would award its Gulf
Coast Breeders Cup and $1,000 to the first of three couples to
conceive.
   The station is giving its contestants ``love enhancers:'' a
water bed, a night in a hotel, a seafood buffet, a gift certificate
from a lingerie shop, champagne, candles and green M&amp;Ms.
Contestants will be chosen starting Nov. 26.

<HEAD>NATO Grapples With a New Strategy For New Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUNSSUM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's military planners face a
curious task. As member nations extend a hand of friendship to
Moscow, the planners are mapping a new strategy for defending
against the Red Army.
   The Soviets remain Europe's biggest military power.
   Emerging details of the new NATO strategy show an emphasis on
smaller, more flexible integrated armies and on rapid deployment
capabilities to areas that might be threatened. Nuclear weapons
will play a smaller role.
   The strategy, ordered by NATO leaders at a London summit in
July, remains largely under wraps.
   It assumes that Soviet forces do not pose the threat they did
under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's predecessors, but emphasizes that the
Western alliance must remain strong in case of a sudden change in
policy by Moscow.
   ``NATO is not on the rocks,'' said Gen. Hanns-Henning von
Sandrart, who commands more than half a million NATO troops in
central Europe.
   The military threat may have lessened but ``nobody says that as
a consequence of what happens in the East we should abandon NATO,''
the German general told reporters recently in his home near his
headquarters in this southern Dutch town.
   The new planning comes amid unprecedented changes.
   Next week, NATO and the nations of the disintegrating Warsaw
Pact are to sign a treaty in Paris limiting battle tanks, armored
combat vehicles, artillery, combat planes and assault helicopters
across Europe.
   Under the treaty, the 16 allies of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization will remove 8,000 pieces of military equipment, the 16
Warsaw Pact nations about 100,000.
   Deployments on each side are likely to ultimately fall below the
20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces,
2,000 combat aircraft and 6,800 attack helicopters allowed under
the treaty.
   Moscow has already promised to withdraw all its forces from the
soil of its former allies by 1994.
   And because of changed deployments in Eastern Europe, NATO
planners believe the warning time the alliance would have of an
attack from the East is now days or weeks, rather than the minutes
it counted on previously.
   The new defense strategy will reflect a reduced reliance on
nuclear arms.
   The United States will not modernize its short-range Lance
missiles and nuclear artillery shells, leaving only aircraft
carrying free-fall bombs in Europe. Chances of deploying a new
air-to-surface missile are seen as slim.
   In the alliance's new plans, no NATO commander will feel the
changes more than von Sandrart.
   The German general commands eight army corps, 560,000 troops, on
what was once Armageddon's doorstep: the area including Germany,
Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands that was expected to bear
the brunt an armored Warsaw Pact assault.
   But his eight corps in NATO's central region - three German, two
American and one each from Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands -
have become anachronistic.
   ``I can see the central region going down to four, maybe five
corps, within three years,'' von Sandrart.
   The remaining corps - 300,000 troops - would each comprise three
multinational divisions of 25,000-odd troops. Most would be
``guard'' forces. Others would be division-strength, ``rapid
reaction forces.''
   Von Sandrart said, ``There is a strong case for more
multinational integration of forces.'' Currently, NATO operates a
``layer cake'' of national forces, deployed side-by-side.
   With more multinational integration of forces would come a
greater integration of arms, a goal that has long eluded NATO.
   The alliance's members make four different main battle tanks
that fire different shells.
   Half a dozen make communications systems unable to ``speak''
with each other. None are compatible with NATO's own communications
system.
   Key to NATO's new strategy remains the notion, enshrined in the
NATO treaty, that an attack against one ally ``shall be considered
an attack against them all.''
   Military planners do not see the end of the Cold War undermining
NATO's relevance as an outfit for military and political
consultations, one that links the United States to Europe and is a
guarantee against a military mobilization in any one country.
   While the allies agree events outside NATO's borders, notably in
the Middle East, affect their interests, the alliance is unlikely
to engage in joint operations, although the issue is under debate.
   ``That is a highly political question,'' said von Sandrart.
``First our political masters will have to come to grips with
that.''
   At any rate, NATO's new strategy does not foresee an
``out-of-area'' presence of NATO troops under allied command.
   Joint out-of-area operations do not enjoy much support in NATO
capitals, said Simon Lunn, deputy secretary general of the North
Atlantic Assembly, a consultative body of lawmakers from the NATO
nations.

<HEAD>Repetitive Motion Disorders Rise Sharply in 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Americans who developed
repetitive motion disorders on the job jumped 28 percent in 1989,
accounting for nearly all of the increase in workplace injuries
last year, the government says.
   About 147,000 repetitive trauma disorders among American workers
were reported last year - 32,000 more than in 1988, the Labor
Department said Wednesday.
   Repetitive motion disorders include illnesses such as carpal
tunnel syndrome, which causes pain in the wrists and forearms. The
disorders often are suffered by workers on assembly lines who
repeat the same motions with their arms and hands throughout the
day.
   The Labor Department said there were 284,000 reported cases of
occupational illness and 6.3 million job-related injuries among
workers in private industry in 1989. That was 136,000 more than the
241,000 illnesses and 6.2 million injuries in 1988.
   Although total injuries and illnesses increased by about 2
percent last year, their rate of occurrence in the labor force -
8.6 per 100 fulltime workers - was the same as in 1988. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics said the increase in numbers of injuries and
illnesses tracked the increase in employment and hours worked
proportionately.
   The survey found about 3,600 work-related deaths. But the agency
cautioned that the estimate is probably understated because its
survey was not large enough to accurately track all fatalities.
   The AFL-CIO, which represents 14.2 million unionized workers,
estimates that 10,000 American workers are killed on the job each
year and 70,000 are permanently disabled.
   Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell, who heads the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said he was
disappointed there had been no decrease in the rate of on-the-job
injuries and illnesses.
   ``These results highlight the challenges that continue to face
employers, employees and OSHA,'' Scannell said.
   Injuries from accidents at work are reportable if they result in
death, loss of consciousness, restricted work activity, a transfer
to another job or medical treatment beyond first aid.
   Almost half of the 6.3 million injury cases were serious enough
for the injured worker to have work activity restricted or to lose
work time. Those cases resulted in about 57 million lost workdays
in 1989, the Labor Department said.
   Manufacturing had about 20 percent of the private sector
employment in 1989, but slightly more than 33 percent of total
reported injuries. In contrast, the services industry had nearly 30
percent of the employment total but only 16 percent of the injury
cases.
   Nine individual industries reported at least 100,000 injury

<HEAD>Battle Shaping Up Over HDTV Technology Choice</HEAD>

   Television manufacturers, broadcasters and a
prestigious university plan to square off next year over whose
state-of-the-art technology will bring high-definition TV to
America by the mid-1990s.
   The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced an
April 8, 1991, start date for a year-long series of tests to
determine which of five competing systems should be the U.S.
standard for HDTV. The FCC should decide the issue by June 1993.
   The applicants include the Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Europe's
major TV manufacturers, which already are beginning to implement
their own systems overseas.
   The commission also said it will test a sixth proposal, a
partial HDTV system being proposed by a David Sarnoff Research
Center consortium that includes Thomson Consumer Electronics and
NBC.
   HDTV promises crystal-clear pictures and compact disc-quality
sound by cable, satellite or through traditional broadcasters such
as ABC, CBS and NBC. Its advocates say it could be a
multibillion-dollar industry on its own by the year 2000 and
possibly revitalize a lagging U.S. electronics sector.
   HDTV entertainment programs are expected to appear by 1995 - for
those able to afford it. In Japan, where HDTV already is being
delivered an hour a day to satellite dishes, HDTV sets cost $17,800
and up.
   Besides giving the public a sharper view of ``Roseanne,'' the
advanced television has potential military, educational and medical
applications
   U.S. testing originally was to have begun this year, but the
schedule slipped because of changing proposals from nearly a dozen
interested companies and unexpected difficulties in developing
proper testing equipment.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the test schedule was ``ambitious
but realistic.''
   He cautioned, however, that the FCC should not rush to judgment
on an HDTV standard. At the same time, he said the nation cannot
afford to wait too long to launch HDTV.
   Japan expects to have fulltime coverage in 1992, and Europeans
are expected to be able to watch the 1992 Olympics on a European
HDTV system.
   The testing will take place at the Advanced Television Test
Center in Alexandria, Va. It will run for about two months for each
proposal, in conjunction with Cable Labs, the cable industry's
research arm. Viewer-testing of the proposals will follow in
Canada, along with field testing here.
   Five of the six applicants are proposing to completely or
partially use the computer-precise technique of digital
electronics, as opposed to the current analog systems.
   The six applicants, in the order of testing, are: the David
Sarnoff Research Center; Japan Broadcasting Corp.; General
Instrument Corp.; Zenith Electronics Corp.; N.A. Philips Consumer
Electronics Co.; and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Sikes said other applicants could be considered in the testing
if they come up with different technology ``that appears to offer
important benefits to the public.''
   In order not to make millions of existing TV sets obsolete, the
commission says the winning HDTV system must use a ``simulcast''
technique. TV stations would have to broadcast two signals - one on
its regularly assigned channel in today's format known as NTSC and
the other in high-definition on a separate channel.
   Although Congress has provided some money for U.S. HDTV research
through the Defense Department and other agencies, the American
electronics industry is basically going it alone against foreign
competitors that are being heavily subsidized by their governments.

<HEAD>More Equality is Hallmark of 1980s Education Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education reforms of the past decade sparked a
move toward greater equality rather than greater excellence, the
head of the nation's largest testing organization says.
   Gregory R. Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service,
released a series of reports Wednesday that showed ``considerable
reductions'' in the educational achievement gaps between
17-year-old black students and white students. However, they showed
little progress in reducing gaps between Hispanic and white
students.
   Paul Barton, director of ETS' Policy Information Center, said
officials plan to investigate whether immigration trends had
anything to do with the difficulty of closing the gap between
17-year-old Hispanics and whites.
   ``The hallmark of the decade was a move toward greater equality
rather than a move toward greater excellence,'' said Anrig.
   ``It's going to take some time for the results of reform efforts
undertaken in the 1980s to appear,'' said Anrig. ``The declines of
the 1970s were the result of a loosening of standards in the 1960s.
Thus, for most students, improvements that may result from reforms
of the 1980s probably won't appear until the mid-1990s.
   ``Minorities, however, can be justifiably proud of their
steadily improving academic achievement during this period of
sweeping change,'' he said.
   The assessment was based on results of the National Assessment
of Educational Progress, a congressionally mandated exam of
children age 9, 13 and 17, and on results of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test taken by students who plan to go to college.
   Between black and white 17-year-olds taking the NAEP tests, the
report found that in reading, the gap declined from 50.6 scale
points in 1980 to 20.3 in 1988, a 60 percent drop. The scale is
from 0 to 500.
   In science, the gap narrowed from 57.4 scale points in 1977 to
44.7 in 1986, a 22 percent decline. In mathematics, there was a 23
percent decrease in the gap, from 37.5 scale points in 1978 to 28.9
scale points in 1986.
   In SAT scores from 1980 to 1990, the black-white gap narrowed by
22 points in verbal and 16 points in math, a decrease of 20 percent
and 13 prcent, respectively.
   The report said there now is little difference in the percent of
16- to 24-year-old blacks and whites getting a high school diploma;
the 6 percentage point gap in 1980 was reduced to 2 percentage
points in 1989. However, far fewer blacks went on to college, ETS
said.
   The report said Hispanic 13-year-olds were the only age group
that showed improvement on the NAEP test. The gap between their
performance on the test and that of 13-year-old whites was reduced
by 43 percent in math and by 22 percent in science.
   With the SAT scores, there was about a 10 percent reduction in
the gap between Mexican-American and white students in verbal and
math results, and a 11 percent reduction in the gap between Puerto
Rican and white students on the verbal test. There was virtually no
reduction in the gap on the math test.
   Barton noted that throughout the decade, females continued to
outperform males in reading. In mathematics, males led females, but
the gap was small. The gap favoring males continued in science and
females outperformed males considerably in writing, although the
gap narrowed a little.
   ``The performance gap between the Southeast and Northeast also
narrowed by 57 percent in mathematics, 44 percent in civics, and 30
percent in science,'' said Barton.
   In other findings, the report said that by the end of the 1980s,
42 states raised high school graduation requirements and 47 states
had installed statewide student testing programs. In addition,
sweeping changes in teacher standards were adopted in 39 states.
Many states also adopted statewide education accountability
systems.
   Stricter attendance policies were adopted by 73 percent of high
schools, 61 percent of middle schools, and 46 percent of elementary
schools. Longer school days also were reported in 40 percent of
high schools.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Against Yen, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the yen Thursday in
Tokyo, while share prices fell.
   The dollar closed at 129.30 yen, up 0.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 129.05 yen. It opened at 129.20 yen and ranged between
128.95 yen and 129.35 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 449.96 points, or 1.88
percent, closing at 23,487.48. The index lost 36.23 points, or 0.15
percent, the previous day.
   Dealers said the dollar was trading in a tight range below the
130-yen psychological barrier in part due to continuing uncertainty
about U.S. interest rates.
   Market players have been expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to
lower interest rates in an effort to boost the nation's weakening
economy.
   Many participants tried to push the dollar as high as 129.80 yen
so that they can take profits while they were also afraid of a
demand for the dollar as a safe haven, dealers said.
   ``Investors are more interested in the European currencies,''
said Masato Hayashi, a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   The yen was gradually strengthening against the German Mark,
dealers said.
   On the stock exchange, traders said share prices were lower
across the board due to selling by market players discouraged by
the yen's weakness.
   ``There was little buying incentive in the market, and it will
get worse toward the weekend,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with
Daiwa Securities Co.

<HEAD>GOP Wants Democrats to Stop Griping, Share Responsibility in Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   By raising the spectre of a declaration of
near-war against Iraq, congressional Republicans are pressuring
Democrats to stop carping and share some political responsibility
with President Bush.
   It's time to ``put up or shut up,'' was how Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole put it, making clear that ``shut up'' was his
preferred option.
   As public support for Bush and America's Persian Gulf operation
has softened, Democrats have become increasingly bold in finding
fault with the president's handling of the crisis.
   Democrats have been supporting the overall policy but taking
shots at Bush for new troop increases, failure to justify his
actions, and failure to consult adequately with Congress.
   ``I think the president must explain more completely his policy
to the American people, and he has a constitutional responsibility
to consult more widely with Congress,'' House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Wednesday, adding that Democrats
otherwise support a policy of ``patient strength.''
   To Republicans, the Democratic position is to look good for
supporting the president, and provide themselves political cover in
case the whole operation turns sour. And Republicans are tired of
it.
   ``Almost daily, there's some senator out there saying or some
member of the House saying, `Well, he's not doing this right or we
didn't know this or we should have been consulted on this,''' Dole
said. ``We can't have it both ways.''
   The appearance of partisan divisions prompted Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., an influential foreign policy expert, to suggest
this week that Congress come back into special session to consider
the equivalent of a declaration of war.
   ``So long as Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world have any
doubt about the unified resolve of the United States in this
matter, the chances for miscalculation and tragic mistakes loom
much too large,'' he said.
   Democrats, seeking to maintain their current advantages,
answered Lugar's proposal by announcing they would hold hearings.
But that wouldn't accomplish the same purpose.
   ``If you could have hearings and have a consensus with everybody
agreeing on it, fine,'' said Mark Helmke, a consultant and former
top aide to Lugar. ``(But) the issue's been aired out pretty
heavily. What we want is a resolve.''
   Bush will consider after Thanksgiving whether to call for such a
session, Dole said Wednesday after meeting with the president.
   Dole himself, however, expressed doubts about the idea. He and
other GOP and Democratic leaders expressed worry that a special
session would only enhance political gamesmanship, harming U.S.
efforts to present a united front to the world and maintain
pressure on Saddam.
   ``How do you have a consultation in the American tradition
without sending the wrong signal to Saddam Hussein? I think that's
the $64 question,'' Dole said.
   ``I have been concerned that our position could be greatly
weakened by a growth of partisanship on this issue,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Despite the Democrats' sniping, Gramm said he did not believe
they would risk undermining troops in the field for partisan gain.
``Many Democrats are biting around the edges but they're not
willing to bite off a big chunk,'' he said.
   Democrats didn't argue with that assessment, and leaders of both
parties were steering away from Lugar's idea Wednesday unless
things change.
   ``I don't think you could pass a pro- or anti-(war)
resolution,'' said a top aide to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   And since Congress would be pressured to pass something, the
result likely would be ``some high, lofty resolution ... the
interpretation of which is left up in the air,'' he said.
   Foley said he would not put Democrats ``in a position where they
could potentially embarrass themselves.''
   Helmke said those misgivings made it all the more imperative
that Congress vote on the matter.
   ``If members don't have the guts to say what they think, then
that should be revealed to the public,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Head of S&amp;L Trade Group Once Shunned by Industry Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chairman of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions was once shunned by the trade group's leaders
for warning, correctly, that the government fund protecting the
industry's deposits was bankrupt.
   That was in 1985. Now, five years later, the organization has
turned to tough-talking Donald Shackelford to lead the industry
next year, when it will be fighting for its very survival.
   Shackelford, chairman of State Savings Bank in Columbus, Ohio,
one of the nation's strongest S&amp;Ls, closed the group's 98th annual
convention Wednesday by declaring the era of the ``fast buckaroos''
to be over.
   In the mid-1980s, when Shackelford was feuding with league
leaders, the group was fighting to keep its members from paying to
clean up the mess. Now, he told S&amp;L executives, ``Our policy has to
be defined to be totally consistent with public policy.''
   Shackelford praised provisions in last year's law requiring
thrift owners to invest more of their own capital. That has
succeeded in curbing the irresponsible growth of the industry, he
said.
   ``We want capital standards that are as high as anybody who
takes your mother's money, depositors' money,'' he said. ``The new
guys coming in, the fast buckaroos - that's over.''
   However, the new law has failed to attract the investors needed
to reduce the government's risks, Shackelford said, and surviving
S&amp;Ls must attract new capital if taxpayers are to be insulated from
future losses.
   ``The only way to get government out is to get private capital
in. There aren't three sources. It's either private money or the
government's money. There is no Tinkerbell coming to put money
in,'' he said.
   In an interview after his speech, Shackelford criticized rules
which force thrift institutions to concentrate 70 percent of their
assets on housing even when real estate markets are in the
doldrums.
   And he said would-be investors have been scared off by
uncertainty over whether the government will try to take a bigger
share of the profits from the industry-owned Federal Home Loan
Banks, which supply funds to S&amp;Ls.
   In addition, regulation of S&amp;Ls has gone from tough to mean in
some cases, he said.
   ``We've got a regulatory climate now that people are running
around trying to cover their rear ends so much they're going to get
diaper rash,'' he said. ``You've got to learn to distinguish
between double parkers and rapists. You don't have to be for either
one, but you have to treat them differently.''
   Shackelford is vaulting over Robert B. O'Brien, chairman of
Carteret Savings Bank, Morristown, N.J., who asked to remain as
league vice chairman while he works to solve the debt problems of
Carteret's holding company.
   Meanwhile, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, former chairman
of First Nationwide Bank, a San Francisco S&amp;L, warned that the cost
of dealing with failed S&amp;Ls is still growing.
   ``I believe we're facing a problem north of $500 billion,'' he
said. ``I believe the thrift situation has the potential and even
the probability ... to make our country a second-rate power.''
   Frank, unlike many at the convention, said thrifts must remain a
separate industry from commercial banks, supervised by their own
regulator and dedicated to providing financial services to
households, as opposed to businesses.

   Police have charged the son of Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan with raping a woman last weekend in her
home.
   Robert Jeffrey Lujan was picked up for questioning at his
parents' Alexandria home about 7 p.m. Wednesday. He later was
arrested and jailed, said Robert Mains, a police communications
supervisor.
   Lujan's parents have said their son has denied the allegation,
according to Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for the Interior
Department.
   ``Their son has told them that it (the sex) was consentual,''
Goldstein said late Wednesday. ``Mr. Lujan has determined that he
will not interfere with the due process of the law. He hasn't even
been down to the jail this evening because he does not want to give
any sense of impropriety.''
   Mains said the victim alleges the attack occurred about 4:30
a.m. Sunday in the same high rise building where Lujan lives with
his parents.
   Goldstein confirmed local television reports that the
unidentified victim told police she was raped after she awoke to
find a man burglarizing her home.
   Goldstein said the younger Lujan was in his mid-20s, but he did
not have his precise age. Mains said he did not know Lujan's age.
   His parents ``are quite concerned,'' Goldstein said. ``It's
difficult because he's secretary of the interior, but he's still a
parent.''
   Lujan planned to be at work today, Goldstein said.
   ``It's a personal matter, and the secretary plans to go on with
business as usual,'' he said.

   A Texan faces up to eight years in
prison and a $1 million fine for bilking two banks by posing as a
nobleman from France's wealthy Rothschild family.
   A federal jury deliberated an hour Wednesday before convicting
Maur Rothschild, 38, of fraud. Rothschild, who changed his name
from Mario Cortez Jr. and had claimed to be a baron, faces
sentencing Jan. 30.
   Defense attorney Matthew Martin said the banks were partly to
blame.
   ``Don't you know the folks at these institutions began to
salivate when they heard a member of the internationally-known
family of Rothschild had come to Durham,'' Martin said. ``The banks
were involved in his fantasy as well.''
   The charges involved credit and credit-card applications at the
Duke Federal Credit Union and Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. in 1987 and
1989. Rothschild signed applications as Baron Maurice de
Rothschild, once listing his mother as Baroness Maurie de
Rothschild.
   The prosecution refused to say how much money Rothschild
obtained, but it was believed to be thousands of dollars.
   Rothschild testified that he was a psychologically troubled man
who got caught up in his fantasies. He said that the banks
pressured him into taking loans and never verified his identity.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney John Stone said Rothschild was
``nothing more than a con man'' who finally got caught.
   Rothschild said that while he was a student at Duke University
in 1987 he began to believe he was a member of France's
Rothschilds. He said he had been abused as a child and had
undergone extensive therapy and ``basically it got to a point where
I lived out my fantasies.''
   Rothschild also faces state charges that he fraudulently
obtained $1,200 from a cancer fund in Durham in 1989.

<HEAD>Standoff Over Temple Mount Killings Ends With Agreement On U.N.
Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council and Israel have
agreed that a U.N. envoy will visit Israel to discuss ways of
protecting Palestinians, the U.S. ambassador says, in an apparent
end to a bitter standoff.
   Israel's refusal to allow a U.N. visit after police killed at
least 17 Palestinians during last month's Temple Mount riot had
threatened Arab-U.S. unity in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said Wednesday after meeting
with the 15 council members that ``I detected a very strong note of
interest in the council in the mission going ahead, so I assume it
will go ahead.''
   Israel's international isolation has increased since it refused
to cooperate with a Security Council request to send U.N.
investigators to check on the Oct. 8 slayings at Temple Mount in
Jerusalem's walled old city.
   The United States joined the other 14 council members in voting
unanimously Oct. 12 to condemn Israeli security forces for firing
on Palestinian demonstrators and again a week later to criticize
Israel for refusing to receive the U.N. mission.
   Last weekend, Israel suggested that U.N. envoy Jean-Claude Aime
could visit Israel, but only if he discussed the Palestinian
problem as he did in June, not probe the killings on the Temple
Mount.
   ``The position of the government of Israel was read out'' to the
council in private on Wednesday, said Pickering, speaking in his
capacity as president of the Security Council during November.
   ``Everybody concluded that that didn't set any conditions for
the mission,'' he said.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will have to approve
of sending Aime. Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for the
secretary-general said the U.N. chief does not accept conditions on
missions he sends to foreign countries.
   If the Security Council does not see Israel's invitations as
setting conditions, presumably Aime's mission can proceed.
   Aime was in Israel in June to investigate the killings of seven
Palestinians by an Israeli in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion
on May 20 and subsequent riots in the occupied territories in which
the army shot and killed 20 Palestinians.
   Israel has argued that accepting a Security Council
investigation on the Temple Mount incident would threaten the
country's claim to sovereignty over predominantly Arab east
Jerusalem, where the Temple Mount is located.
   The Jewish state captured the eastern sector of the city from
Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and later annexed it. The
annexation is not recognized by the United States, United Nations
or most other nations.
   Israel also seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the war, but
did not annex them. For nearly three years, Palestinians have been
in revolt in the territories, seeking to end Israeli occupation.

   McDonald's Corp. is hoping the health-conscious
will want to sink their teeth into a new super-lean hamburger that
replaces some of the fat with an algae product.
   The Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast-food giant announced Wednesday it
is test marketing the 91 percent fat-free burger in 54 franchises
in the Harrisburg, Pa., area.
   ``We're excited about it and are very optimistic,'' said Chuck
Rubner, a McDonald's spokesman. ``They like the taste of the
product and they like the fact that it's a low-fat alternative.''
   The Lean Deluxe quarter-pound burger with condiments has a 10.5
percent fat content and 310 calories. That compares to a 20.7
percent fat content and about 410 calories in the McDonald's
regular Quarter Pounder.
   ``That's unbelievable,'' said Michael Jacobson, director of the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group in
Washington. ``Obviously, I'd have to taste it, but it could be the
best burger on the market in terms of fat content.''
   The patty is composed of 90 percent lean beef, 9 percent water
and 1 percent seasonings, Rubner said. Carrageenan, a gumlike algae
product used in meats and other foods to bind ingredients, is
listed as one of its seasonings.
   The secret to the hamburger is the carrageenan - hailed by the
beef industry as revolutionary - because it binds the patty
together much as fat would, said Mary Adolf of the Beef Industry
Council of the Meat Board.
   The board funded Auburn University work to develop the low-fat
beef, and McDonald's was the first to test-market it.
   ``It's very similar in taste and texture to a standard-type
ground beef patty,'' Adolf said.
   Nutrition experts welcomed the development but cautioned that it
is one new product in a menu loaded with fat and cholesterol.
   ``One has to look at a food's place in relation to the total
diet,'' said Karen Miller-Kovach, spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Association.
   ``If you go into a restaurant, order the (fat-free) burger and
an extra-large order of fries, then you may not be doing yourself
any favor.''
   The new hamburger also does little to reduce sodium content,
said Jacobson.

   Bottles of Beaujolais popped open across France
today as this year's production of the fruity red wine was released
to rave reviews.
   Experts hailed the 1990 Beaujolais as among the best, thanks to
grapes with a high sugar content because of a drought.
   ``It's a very good year, with a very good aroma,'' said Michel
Pouilhis, an accountant, after a few glasses of the ruby-red
vintage at Le Lutin wine bar and restaurant. ``But what's most
important is the tradition. The French love tradition.''
   That tradition dictates that sales of Beaujolais are embargoed
until midnight of the third Thursday in November.
   The Japanese, usually the first in world to taste Beaujolais
because of the time difference (eight hours ahead of France), will
have to wait until Nov. 22 before raising Beaujolais in a
``kampai'' (cheers).
   The Tokyo government has suspended cargo flights into Japan for
the next week as a security measure for a series of enthronement
rituals for newly crowned Emperor Akihito.
   Philippe Girard, owner of Le Lutin, near the Arc de Triomphe,
lives and breathes by the Beaujolais tradition, even bottling it
himself after buying it by the barrel.
   ``I spent six hours washing 70 bottles yesterday,'' Girard said.
``I take it seriously. The proof is that while I was bottling I
didn't drink a single drop. And then, at one past midnight, clack!
- I offered a glass, on the house, to every customer here. Now
that's tradition.''
   A widespread and highly orchestrated advertising blitz heralds
Beaujolais' arrival each year. ``It's the biggest commercial
publicity operation ever invented in the world,'' said Girard.
``It's big business.''
   But there is nevertheless a genuine eagerness surrounding its
arrival.
   ``It's like a nationwide festival, a second July 14th,'' said
wine merchant Patrice Marcoue, referring to national celebrations
marking the French Revolution.
   Marcoue, who owns the Caves Mermoz wine cellar in Paris' chic
St. Honore district, was delighted with Beaujolais 1990.
   ``Like the last two years, it is superb,'' he said. ``It's
fruity, low in alcohol and rolls on the tongue.''
   Other oenophiles are describing this year's vintage in Gallic
sensual terms: ``racy,'' ``tender,'' ``full-bodied'' and
``well-formed''.
   The wine is named after the Beaujolais region in eastern France
near the Swiss border, where 8,900 acres of vineyards yield the
unassuming wine with a worldwide following.
   ``It's not a noble wine,'' said Marcoue. ``It goes well with
sausage.''
   Yet more than half of the 75 million bottles produced this year
will be exported to 80 countries, led by Germany, Britain, Japan
and the United States, according to the Interprofessional Union of
Beaujolais.
   American wine lovers almost missed Beaujolais this year because
of the presence of the banned fungicide procymidone. Washington and
Paris haggled briefly before agreeing on the exports.
   The wine costs $4 to $7 per bottle in France but a whopping $27
per airlifted bottle in Tokyo. Prices in the Japanese capital tend
to sink to about $8 for later arrivals.
   The ``very good'' vintages are this year, 1985 and 1989. 1987
was considered average, and 1984 below par.
   Bistros and restaurants across France prepared for their annual
deluge of longtime clientele and old friends wanting to taste the
wine on its first day.

   Complaining that the selection process
too often puts personality ahead of grades, some high schools
around the country are dropping or considering eliminating their
National Honor Society chapters.
   Hampshire Regional High School last week joined those that have
withdrawn from the 22,000-chapter NHS, a program that high school
students with a ``B'' average have listed on their college
appliations for the past 70 years.
   The school complained that entrance requirements of character,
leadership and service are too subjective
   ``Too often selection becomes a matter of personality,'' said
Deborah Niswonger, chairwoman of the school board that oversees
645-student Hampshire High. She said the non-scholastic criteria
rule out too many ``serious students.''
   At the urging of teachers, including the NHS adviser, the board
voted to install its own honor society, with grades the only
criteria. ``Our faculty really cares about kids and not just one
kind of kid,'' Niswonger said.
   Hampshire was the only school in the past year to quit the
society, said Dale Hawley, director of student activities for the
National Association of Secondary School Principals. The
association has overseen the NHS since a group of high school
principals in Pittsburgh started the student recognition group in
1920.
   Although schools have wide latitude in using the selection
criteria, they cannot base their decision soley on academics,
Hawley said. ``We are looking for the total child, who is
outstanding both in and out of the classroom,'' he said.
   And deportment counts.
   ``Local faculty councils tolerate different levels of
behavior,'' Hawley said. ``But there are a lot of smart people, who
may be working hard, but not chosen, because they have not
demonstrated strong character.''
   It's those criteria that moved Hampshire and other schools to
opt out of the society.
   Cony High School in Augusta, Maine, hasn't had an NHS chapter
for at least seven years and ``hasn't missed it,'' said Principal
Charles Adams.
   ``People felt the issues of leadership, character, service, and
whatever were too difficult to quantify,'' he said.
   Instead, the top 10 percent of each class at the 1,000-student
school are ``Cony Scholars'' and get a pin and a gold cord at
graduation.
   Roger Lonbaker, principal at T. F. Riggs High School in Pierre,
S.D., said, ``If I was a betting man I'd bet there isn't a school
that has a National Honor Society chapter that hasn't at some point
in time considered changing.''
   His 550-student school will continued in the organization
``until we really find it is too frustrating,'' Lonbaker said.
   The move to buck the NHS at Hampshire High began after a parent
wanted to know why a child had been rejected. The five-member
faculty selection committee had no written records and said it
couldn't recall why.
   Hawley said national guidelines call for secret elections with
no explanation for why students are rejected. There is no
opportunity for appeal.
   The student president of Hampshire's NHS chapter said she was
disappointed to see it go. ``I just feel they are taking away an
honor,'' said Amy Christienson. ``It's a distinguished group and
people in the school know that.''
   But Aaron Domina, another NHS member, said he supported the
move.
   ``The way it is now, there are people who have high averages,
who aren't honored,'' he said.

<HEAD>Van Gogh Drawing Sets World Record Price at Christie's</HEAD>

   An ink image of summer fields, sketched by
Vincent van Gogh with a reed he cut from the banks of a French
canal, sold at auction for $8.6 million - the highest price ever
paid for a drawing.
   ``Garden of Flowers'' was sold Wednesday to an anonymous bidder
at Christie's auction of modern and Impressionist art. The bid
topped the auction house's pre-sale estimate of $5 million to $7
million.
   The sale of the van Gogh came in the midst of what art experts
say is a slumping art market.
   The previous record for a drawing was for a Raphael sold at
Christie's London in 1984 for $4.77 million.
   Van Gogh drew the work in 1888 with a reed cut by the banks of
one of the canals near Arles in the south of France. At the time,
he needed to save money on the more expensive oil and canvas
supplies.
   In a letter to his brother, Theo, the artist wrote about the
energetic ink strokes he used to draw a field and houses in Arles:
``I have just sent off three big drawings, and the little cottage
done vertically is, I think, the best.''
   The rest of Christie's auction Wednesday was further proof of
the softening art market. Many of the finest works of the late 19th
and early 20th centuries sold below the pre-sale estimates - or not
at all.
   One surprises was the failure to sell van Gogh's oil ``Vase with
Cornflowers and Poppies,'' which was estimated to be worth $12
million to $16 million. The highest bid was about $9 million, below
the minimum price.
   ``The grim reaper has taken his toll,'' said Christie's
president Christopher Burge. ``Areas of the market that have been
pushed to extraordinary heights have been eliminated. ... We're
seeing speculators disappearing and other traditional collectors
reappearing.''
   The highest price of the evening was paid for Fernand Leger's
oil ``Houses Beneath the Trees,'' which sold for $9.9 million to an
unidentified American dealer. The estimated pre-sale price was $10
million to $12 million.
   Of 47 works offered, 15 failed to sell because they didn't meet
the confidential minimum price set before the auction. Of the 32
works that sold, 17 matched or surpassed the pre-sale price
estimates, Christie's said.
   The total sale for Wednesday night was $92.3 million.

<HEAD>Pipeline to Carry Canadian Gas to Northeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new $583 million pipeline linking the
Northeast to Canadian natural gas fields could start trimming the
region's dependence on imported oil within as little as a year, its
developers say.
   After four years of contentious debate among environmentalists,
homeowners and rival energy suppliers, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission on Wednesday unanimously approved the
Iroquois pipeline project.
   ``Canada is going to play a role in our natural gas supply in
the future and I think the Iroquois pipeline is going to be an
integral part of that,'' said FERC board member Jerry Langdon.
   Ultimately, tight energy supplies in New England, New York and
New Jersey outweighed the concerns of pipeline opponents. They
ranged from wildcat oil drillers in the Southwest to psychologist
Dr. Joyce Brothers, whose Hudson Valley estate in New York would be
crossed by the line.
   Nearly half of New England's primary energy needs are now met by
oil. The region, for example, uses oil to generate nearly a third
of its electricity, compared to only 2.8 percent nationwide,
according to Iroquois.
   Existing gas pipelines to the Northeast from U.S. gas fields
have been running at capacity for years. FERC is considering many
applications to expand existing pipelines but Iroquois is the only
totally new line proposed for the region.
   Robert J. Reid, president of the Iroquois Gas Transmission
System, a consortium of U.S. and Canadian gas companies and
utilities based in Shelton, Conn., said the consortium hopes to
have gas flowing to New York and New England by November 1991 and
to complete the line by January 1992.
   The pipeline will extend 370 miles from the St. Lawrence River
through the woodlands of upstate New York, beneath the Hudson
River, into affluent sections of western Connecticut and across
Long Island Sound to Long Island.
   It is designed to deliver 575 million cubic feet of gas daily,
or enough to meet the energy needs of 1.5 million homes. Some of
the gas will go toward electricity generation rather than home
heating and industrial uses.
   TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., one of Iroquois' several owners,
estimated the new line will generate $1 billion per year in exports
for Canada. Canada has been supplying natural gas to the United
States since the 1960s, but mostly in the West and Midwest.

<HEAD>AIDS Panelists Differ on Time Spent to Weigh Steroids Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a scientific panel that drafted
guidelines for adding steroids to the treatment of a killer
pneumonia in people with AIDS disagree over whether they took too
long to come up with teir findings.
   ``In retrospect, it should have happened more quickly,'' Paul
Meier, professor of statistics at the University of Chicago and
vice chairman of the 17-member panel, said Wednesday.
   However, Dr. Henry Masure, the panel's chairman and chief of
critical care at the National Institutes of Health, called the
three months for the review ``a relatively short period.''
   ``I don't think it will ever get much faster,'' he said. Since
steroids weaken the immune system, ``the whole concept of giving
steroids to someone with AIDS is very novel and controversial.''
   AIDS activists had charged that the panel - organized by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the
University of California at San Diego - took too long.
   The broad outline of a consensus on the steroid issue was
reached May 15, but it wasn't until late August that the panelists
agreed on technical details, such as who should get the therapy and
in what doses.
   On Oct. 10, the institute sent an alert to 2,600 physicians
informing them that recent studies had found benefits among some
patients with pneumocycstis carinii pneumonia whose treatment was
supplemented with steroids.
   Dr. Samuel Bozzette, assistant professor of medicine at the
University of California at San Diego and a panel member, said that
``in a perfect system, it could have been shorter, but it was not
an unreasonable amount of time.''

   A Soviet man who claimed he had a bomb
hijacked an Aeroflot passenger jet on a domestic flight and forced
its crew to fly to Helsinki, where he surrendered to police on
Thursday, national radio reported.
   None of the 66 passengers or six crew members aboard were hurt,
the report said. The hijacked aircraft landed at 5:30 a.m.
   Police Chief Commissioner Kauko Karhuviita said the Tupolev
aircraft had been en route to Moscow from Leningrad when the
hijacker threatened to blow it up.
   ``The hijacker wanted to fly to Stockholm but the plane landed
here. The situation is under control now,'' Karhuviita said in a
radio interview.
   ``All the passengers are out of the plane and we are holding the
hijacker ... It seems he will want to apply for political asylum,''
Karhuviita said.
   Three Soviet planes have been hijacked to Finland this year.
   The government extradited two hijackers and refused political
asylum for a third, who is in police custoday.
   Three planes have been hijacked to Sweden, where authorities
returned two to the Soviets and allowed one to stay.
   Finland's practice has always been to return hijackers to the
Soviet Union. Sweden previously allowed hijackers to stay.
   The return of two men this year reflected Swedish recognition of
human rights gains in the Soviet Union and a desire to deter other
hijackers.

<HEAD>Lawyer Blocks Ventilation Standards That He Calls Deadly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for an anti-smoking group has blocked the adoption of
national ventilation standards that he said could have caused
thousands of deaths from second-hand cigarette smoke in public
buildings.
   The proposal ``misrepresents the available scientific evidence,
misleading engineers, developers and building code authorities into
believing that they can ... permit `moderate amounts of smoking'
while avoiding significant adverse health effects'' from
second-hand smoke, attorney Richard Daynard wrote in an appeal to
the American National Standards Institute in New York.
   The standards institute said Wednesday it sustained Daynard's
appeal and did not adopt the standards.
   Daynard charged that the proposal reflected the aims of the
tobacco industry, which had sought to soften ventilation
requirements in buildings where smoking is allowed.
   ``The tobacco industry almost succeeded in pulling off a
tremendous coup,'' said Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products
Liability Project in Boston. ``They were using the standards to
cast doubt on the evidence that environmental tobacco smoke causes
disease.''
   The Tobacco Institute has been sending employers a letter that
says, in part, ``Where ventilation is adequate and ventilation
systems are properly maintained, tobacco smoke is not a problem.''
The letter bases that conclusion on the proposed ventilation
standards.
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute in
Washington, denied that the institute had tried to influence the
standards, and she dismissed Daynard's concerns.
   ``Daynard would have us with a smoke-free society,'' she said.
``His position has always been that you cannot protect people from
anything. Daynard is really out in left field on this issue.''
   The dispute over the standards represents a major battle over
smoking that took place almost entirely outside the public's view,
Daynard said.
   ``It's an interesting glimpse into a hidden government which
nobody elected and was not appointed by anyone we elected, but sets
the standards which govern the way we live, the air we breathe,''
he said.
   The standards were written by a committee appointed by the
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers in Atlanta.
   ASHRAE then submitted the standards for adoption by the American
National Standards Institute, a private group that establishes a
wide variety of industrial and consumer standards. Its standards
are often written into law.
   The institute's adoption of the ventilation standards would have
enabled employers to defend themselves against charges they were
endangering employees by allowing smoking in their buildings,
Daynard said.
   He said it is now likely the standards will be changed to
reflect concerns about the toxic effects of cigarette smoke. That
could force many employers to ban smoking or face liability for the
harm that tobacco smoke causes, Daynard said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Research
Council have estimated that second-hand smoke causes 3,800 deaths
in nonsmoking Americans each year.
   A study presented earlier this year by Stanton Glantz and
William Parmley of the University of California at San Francisco
estimated that passive smoking causes 32,000 heart disease deaths
in nonsmokers each year and 53,000 deaths overall.
   The chairman of the ASHRAE committee that drafted the standards,
John Janssen, a Honeywell engineer in Minneapolis, denied that the
tobacco industry influenced the standards. ``They aren't all that
interested,'' he said.
   Janssen said the committee included three nonvoting members who
have done business with the tobacco industry, including a
consultant hired by the Tobacco Institute to represent industry
concerns. One voting member also reviews grants for the Center for
Indoor Air Research, a tobacco-industry supported organization in
Linthicum, Md.
   Members of anti-smoking groups did not regularly participate in
the deliberations, Janssen said.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 13</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll in the country's
worst massacre rose to 13 today when police found human remains in
the debris of a house the killer set ablaze before opening fire on
his neighbors.
   The remains were believed to be those of two 11-year-old girls
missing in the 23-hour siege that ended Wednesday the South Island
seaside hamlet of Aramoana.
   Discovery of the two bodies raised to 13 the number of people
slain by 33-year-old David Gray before police killed him in a
shootout. Two children were wounded by Gray, who wiped out nearly
half of Aramoana's population.
   Gray began his killing spree Tuesday night by setting a
neighbor's house on fire, then opening fire on people who arrived
to try to extinguish the blaze. The motive for his actions remains
unclear.
   Police kept the town cordoned off today except for forensic
experts, government officials and journalists.
   Gray, who holed up in his home before fleeing to a house on the
edge of town, used high-powered rifles to shoot neighbors and keep
police from reaching victims scattered on the lawn of his house and
a nearby street.
   Detective Chief Inspector Peter Robinson told a news conference
today that after police riddled with tear gas and shot the house to
which Gray had fled, he emerged shouting ``Kill me, Kill me'' and
firing a rifle from his hip.
   Fatally wounded, the gunman remained ``very active'' and
criticized police for not finishing him off. ``He was quite
possessed,'' Robinson said. ``He was extremely strong and very
hyped up.''
   The village lies on a point in an area of steep hillsides and
sandy marsh about 20 miles north of Dunedin on the island's
southeastern coast.
   It comprises just five streets and was home to about 25 people
before the massacre. Most of the houses are vacation homes, not
fully occupied this time of year.
   Among those killed were a couple and one of their two children,
with their 4-year-old son hospitalized with a stomach wound. They
were visiting for the day to work on their boat, according to the
couple's nephew.
   A man who lived in the house Gray torched also was shot dead,
and his daughter and a friend's daughter, both 11, were missing and
presumed dead in the fire. The man's 9-year-old daughter was
recovering from a gunshot wound.
   A psychiatrist and four parents helped console children at the
143-student primary school in nearby Port Chester, where the
students included two 6-year-olds who were killed and the two
missing girls.
   The unemployed Gray, who had an obsession with guns, was
reported upset over the recent death of his mother. Some neighbors
also pointed to a long-simmering dispute between Gray and the
victim whose house he burned.

   Kuwaiti officials say resistance fighters
have smuggled out computer records on Kuwait's entire pre-invasion
population, helping frustrate Iraqi efforts to erase all traces of
their society.
   The 25 computer discs are said to contain the names and
fingerprints of the entire population before Iraq's assault.
   They are in New York, and Kuwaiti officials want the United
Nations to take custody of a set until the current crisis is over,
the ambassador of Kuwait's government-in-exile, Mohammad A.
Abulhasan, said Wednesday.
   ``We have discovered from the first two weeks of the Iraqi
aggression that there is a deliberate plan for changing the
demographic status of Kuwait by destroying records,'' he said.
   Abulhasan began circulating the text of a proposed resolution on
Wednesday which would call on U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar to take possession of a copy of the tapes for
safekeeping.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the proposal for the
United Nations to take possession of the records ``seems to us a
very good idea.''
   One mainframe computer had all Kuwait's demographic records,
Abulhasan said. ``Armed with that fact, we were able through the
resistance movement to get out these records, which are electronic
discs,'' he said.
   The records were hidden during the first week of the occupation,
Abulhasan said. ``Fifteen days ago, we managed to get them out of
Kuwait.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the oil-rich
emirate.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile and the U.N. Security Council are
concerned over Iraq's attempt to convert occupied Kuwait into a
province of Iraq and to move 150,000 Iraqis into buildings vacated
by fleeing Kuwaitis.
   Exiled Kuwaitis accuse the Baghdad government of trying to
repopulate their country with supporters of President Saddam
Hussein.
   The underground movement salvaged information on all 1.75
million residents of Kuwait, Abulhasan said. He said the
information was current with names, addresses and fingerprints.
   The records will help ``to differentiate between the Kuwaitis
and the non-Kuwaitis'' when the crisis is over and might be the
basis for compensation claims, he said.

   A strong earthquake jolted the
northern part of Indonesia's Sumatra Island and shook high-rise
buildings in Thailand and Malaysia today, but officials said no
casualties or damage were reported.
   The quake caused momentary panic during the morning rush hour in
the North Sumatra capital of Medan, police there reported.
   It struck at 9:34 a.m. and was measured at 6.2 on the Richter
scale by monitors in Indonesia and Malaysia and at 6.9 by
seismological agencies in Thailand and the United States.
   Monitors put its location in the Andaman Sea, between Sumatra
and the peninsula on which Malaysia and southern Thailand are
located.
   In Bangkok, Thailand's Meteorological Department received
reports that tremors were felt in high-rise buildings in Phuket and
nearby Songkhla province as well as in Bangkok, about 430 miles
north of Phuket.
   In Kuala Lumpur, the tremors sent office workers scurrying down
to the street from many high-rise buildings.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times
greater. A magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas,
while a magnitude 7 means a major quake capable of widespread,
heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   The inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper
says he's ready to take on nearly two dozen other automakers after
accepting a $10.2 million settlement with Ford Motor Co. for
infringing on his patents.
   ``Maybe I got to first base,'' Robert Kearns, 63, of Houston,
said after agreeing to the settlement Wednesday.
   Intermittent wipers, now standard or optional equipment on
nearly all cars sold in the United States, automatically start and
stop at intervals.
   Kearns is claiming in separate lawsuits that 19 automakers
infringed on his patents for the intermittent wipers. The inventor
patented the device in 1967 and shopped them around to automakers.
He started the lawsuits 12 years ago.
   ``I don't think the goal was the magnitude of the money,''
Kearns said. ``What I saw as my role was to defend the patent
system. If I don't go further, there really isn't a patent
system.''
   Chrysler Corp. may be the next defendant up for trial, but a
spokesman indicated the automaker may settle.
   ``Because of the Ford settlement, we're encouraged that we will
probably be able to reach agreement with Mr. Kearns without
extended litigation,'' said Tom Houston.
   Originally, Kearns sought $141 million from Ford. In July, a
jury ordered Ford to pay $5.2 million, plus interest, for patent
infringement, for a total of $8.5 million to $11.5 million. Kearns
appealed the award; the settlement came before the appeal could be
decided.
   ``We're pleased to be done with the litigation,'' said Ford
attorney Malcolm Wheeler. ``We still believe that if we had another
shot at it, the patents would have been held invalid.''
   Bill Durkee, one of Kearns' attorneys, said Ford ``got away with
more than they should. They made a profit from their
infringement.''
   Ford Motor Co. dealers have sold an estimated 20 million Ford,
Lincoln and Mercury cars with intermittent wipers. After legal
defense costs, the settlement nets Kearns 33 cents per car.
   If the Ford settlement pattern were followed with Chrysler's
estimated 13 million cars with intermittent wipers, it would work
out to about $4.3 million without legal fees.
   Durkee said Chrysler probably would be the next legal target.
Durkee said Chrysler has agreed not to contest the validity of
Kearns' patents, an argument that took up time in the Ford trial.
   Kearns had claimed he installed a set of intermittent wipers on
a Ford and took it to the automaker. Kearns, a professor at Wayne
State University in Detroit at the time, said he was led to believe
Ford would buy his invention by the number of questions engineers
asked.
   When that failed to happen, he sued.
   Kearns said he plans to pay off some legal debts and, perhaps,
buy a house in Texas. And he'll continue the legal battles to
protect his patent.
   ``They (lawyers) are running a business,'' he said. ``I'm
running a cause.''

<HEAD>Celebrities Say: Butt Out For Smokeout</HEAD>

   Broadway's Carol Channing said Cupid and fear of
smelling like a sewer led her to quit smoking.
   Hockey star Rod Gilbert said he gave up cigarettes after getting
bopped by his big brother.
   And Broadway actress and singer Karen Akers, who performed in
``Grand Hotel,'' summed up the depth of her anti-smoking
convictions this way: ``I even want my ex-husband to quit.''
   Stars from television, stage, sports, music and politics turned
out Wednesday at American Cancer Society offices in New York to
promote today's Great American Smokeout and say why they kicked the
habit or never started.
   The Smokeout, sponsored by the American Cancer Society, is held
the third Thursday in November to get smokers to quit. This is the
14th annual Smokeout.
   ``When I was 30 and doing eight shows a day, I smoked three
packs a day,'' Channing said. ``I couldn't get into a bathtub
without an ashtray, a match and a cigarette.''
   A warning from her doctor got her thinking about quitting, but,
she said, Cupid deserves the real credit. ``I met my future husband
and he didn't smoke. ... I didn't want to smell like an old sewer
around somebody I was stuck on.''
   Lung surgeon Dr. Bill Cahan of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center told the crowd that Sammy Davis Jr., Yul Brynner and Leonard
Bernstein couldn't attend because they are dead from smoking.
   ``I see the end result of smoking all too often,'' Cahan said.
``As a matter of fact, I've named my surgery room `Marlboro
Country.'''
   Gilbert said at age 12 he stole a pack of cigarettes from his
older brother. When he found out, Gilbert said, ``He took me
upstairs to the bathroom and hit me on the head with his fist ...
and then said, `Get up, I'm going to hit you again.'''
   Gilbert left cigarettes alone until he opened a restaurant after
retirement from hockey.
   ``I guess I felt deprived from the time I was 12,'' he said. He
quit two years ago after having some polyps removed.
   Rapper LL Cool J never was and never will be a smoker.
   ``Smoking is the pits. It's terrible. It's garbage. I hate it.
Get rid of them,'' Cool J said before punching the giant cigarette
box off the stage and into a sound man.
   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
disease, scientists say. The surgeon general has warned of the
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine.

   Sylvester Stallone's sister says it bothers
her that people think the ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo'' star is dimwitted
and self-absorbed.
   ``People think he is really a jerk,'' ToniAn Stallone said in a
taping of the ``Geraldo'' show, which airs Friday. ``It's kind of
sad in a way, because he really struggles against that. I think,
now that he's getting older, he would like to be more respected.''
   Miss Stallone said her brother went to college in Switzerland
and attended the University of Miami. ``I'm proud of him and when I
was little, growing up - there's a big age difference between us -
he was my hero,'' she said.
   Appearing with Miss Stallone on the show were Cher's sister,
Georganne LaPiere, Barbra Streisand's sister, Roslyn Kind, and
Jerry Hall's sister, Rosy Hall.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the dollar moved higher following remarks by the
French economics minister, Pierre Beregovoy, that he expects a
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized countries finance
ministers in the ``coming weeks'' to discuss the dollar's weakness,
   The statement was interpreted as a sign of France's growing
irritation over the dollar's decline, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 129.30 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 129.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.4780 German marks, up from 1.4715

<TEXT>
   Is there a movement under way to keep
Pete Rose out of the Hall of Fame?
   Some members of a committee recently formed to review the Hall's
eligibility guidelines certainly think so. One committee member
called the action taken by the Hall of Fame ``a little
suspicious,'' and another said it's a ``thinly veiled attempt to
keep Rose out.''
   William Guilfoile, the Hall's associate director, said a
nine-member panel of baseball executives and writers will meet in
December or January to look at the way the writers' and veterans'
selection committees choose Hall of Famers.
   The timing of the move raised suspicions among the Baseball
Writers' Association of America, whose 450 members elect players to
the Hall. Rose, the game's all-time hit leader, is eligible for
election in 1992, five years after his last game as a player.
   ``We've been voting since 1935 and there have never been
questions about the way we've been conducting our elections,'' Jack
Lang, executive secretary of the BWAA, said Wednesday. ``Suddenly,
a year before Pete Rose comes up for election, they want to review
our process. It makes us a little suspicious.''
   Guilfoile said the panel was not being convened exclusively to
consider the Rose case. But ``if someone on the committee wants to
discuss it, I'm sure they will be able to,'' he said.
   Sportswriter Frank Dolson of The Philadelphia Inquirer, selected
by the sportswriters' group to serve on the committee, disagreed,
saying the committee is ``just a thinly veiled attempt to keep Rose
out.''
   ``He's eligible in '92, nd you have to ask yourself how it
would look if they have to give a plaque to someone who's been
banned from the game,'' Dolson said. ``What they'll probably do is
make it impossible for us to vote on someone who's banned from
baseball.''
   Rose is serving a prison term in Marion, Ill., for cheating on
his taxes and has been banned from the game for life for gambling.
Nothing in the current rules excludes him from being elected to the
Hall of Fame, Guilfoile said.
   Rose set several records in a 24-year career with Cincinnati,
Montreal and Philadelphia, including most hits (4,256), most
singles (3,215), most games (3,562) and most seasons with 200 or
more hits (10).
   He was considered a shoo-in for the Hall until 1989, when
then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti banned him from the game.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that
Germany is ready to send the Soviets emergency supplies in case of
a food crisis, and a newspaper said Washington is drawing up plans
to provide food and medical aid.
   There is concern that the Soviet Union could face serious
shortages of food and other essentials this winter, causing extreme
hardship and possibly provoking civil unrest.
   Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, said Eastern European nations
also could face severe problems this winter and that he would like
wealthy industrial states to be ready to help out.
   The German leader said that in his talks last weekend with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he promised that Germany
would assist the Soviet Union financially ``to the best of our
powers.''
   He said Germany will be sending a group of ``high-ranking
experts'' to advise the Soviets as they attempt the transition from
a socialist command economy to a free-market system.
   Kohl noted that Germany has already promised massive amounts of
assistance for the Soviets - so far about $19.5 billion.
   He promised that Germany will send emergency shipments of food
to the Soviet Union ``in case of acute supply crises.''
   The chancellor said that in his talks with President Bush this
Sunday at Kohl's home in Oggersheim, he will urge that all Western
industrial nations be ready to help out the economically embattled
former Soviet bloc.
   ``I will discuss with President Bush how the Western industrial
lands can effectively and jointly support the reform processes'' in
Eastern Europe, ``especially in view of the severe winter standing
before the reform states,'' said Kohl.
   Britain's leading business daily, the Financial Times, said
today that the United States already has made plans to aid the
Soviets.
   The Times, without revealing its sources, said that reports this
week that Moscow and Leningrad may have to introduce food rationing
before Christmas heightened White House concern about internal
instability in the Soviet Union.
   The paper said U.S. officials have spoken with allies about the
possibility of international humanitarian aid such as food,
medicine and clothing this winter, but that the means of
coordinating the effort remains unresolved.
   In his speech, Kohl appealed for people who were East Germans
until last month the have patience with the huge presence of Red
Army troops that are to be pulled out over the next few years.
   ``We want the Soviet soldiers and their families to feel good
during their remaining time here,'' said Kohl.
   There has been growing intolerance for the troops among Germans
in the eastern part of the country. In addition, there are reports
of rising crime and desertion among the Soviet soldiers
   The Soviets have agreed to withdraw their army in eastern
Germany by 1994.

   Practically the entire nation had clear skies and looked for
unseasonably high temperatures today as a high-pressure front move
warm air east from the Plains.
   Except for some clouds and fog over Oregon and Washington, skies
were generally clear across the continental United States today.
   Several inches of snow were expected in the mountains in
Washington tonight, and rain was forecast for central California
and Nevada.
   But elsewhere the forecast was for sunny skies and temperatures
as much as 30 degrees above normal.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s across most of the East
Coast and Midwest, the 80s across the South and Southwest, the 60s
in the Northeast, and the 50s and 60s in the Pacific Northwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 90 at Borrego

<HEAD>Strike-Bound Newspaper Reportedly Hiring Drivers as `Bait'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two workers hired as Daily News drivers say they
were really brought in as ``bait'' to get film of strikers
attacking them.
   The two, who have since quit, said they and others were given
video and still cameras and sent out to deliver papers and collect
money from vendors - and be attacked by union members.
   ``We were bait,'' said Jim McCully of Clarksville, Tenn. ``The
bottom line was that we were supposed to be cheese for rats.''
   He and a man from Lexington, Ky., who asked not to be
identified, said in today's The New York Times they answered an ad
in a Kentucky newspaper promising a ``prestigious security
position.''
   But after they got to the New York area, they learned the real
nature of the jobs, they said.
   McCully said he and others were told by a representative of
Securex, the Kentucky security firm that recruited them: ``Your job
is to get documentation on film of union members breaking your
necks.''
   Securex general counsel Bill Crabtree refused to discuss any
connection between the firm and the Daily News.
   ``We have hired vendors from places around the country,'' said
Daily News spokeswoman Lisa G. Robinson. ``We told them to avoid
confrontation, not to carry weapons.'' She would not discuss Daily
News security operations.
   The strike, which began Oct. 25, has been marked by dozens of
reports of violence. The Daily News has reported damage to 76 of
its trucks, and police say 39 vendors have reported being
threatened or having their newspapers taken.

   Palestinians flew their outlawed national flag
from rooftops today and marched through villages chanting
anti-Israeli slogans, defiantly celebrating the second anniversary
of their declaration of independence.
   Army curfews covered most of the Gaza Strip and more than half
of the West Bank, confining more than 1 million Palestinians to
their homes.
   The army closed all schools and declared the Gaza Strip and all
West Bank cities sealed military areas to keep journalists out.
   For the past two days, soldiers have fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to break up marches and demonstrations that were held early
in anticipation of the curfews. They also reportedly carried out
widespread arrests of activists.
   The underground leadership of the nearly 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising called for three days of celebrations, starting today.
They mark the declaration of independence issued Nov. 15, 1988 by
the parliament-in-exile of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In the West Bank village of Tamoun, nationalist songs sounded
from a loudspeaker in the main square. ``We will challenge the army
and its tanks with our war of the knive and the war of the
street,'' one lyric said.
   Twelve masked activists wearing black and khaki uniforms marched
through the village. They brandished knives, unfurled Palestinian
flags and sprayed graffiti.
   The pro-PLO leadership of the uprising allowed shops to stay
open all day during the celebrations, giving respite to a
population worn down by the numerous general strikes that are part
of the intefadeh, or uprising.
   Many cars flew balloons in the Palestinian national colors, army
radio said.
   In Bethlehem, one of the few West Bank towns not under curfew,
Palestinian flags fluttered from rooftops. Near the Church of the
Nativity, where tradition says Jesus was born, shoppers crowded the
outdoor market, taking advantage of all-day shopping.
   The independence declaration, which implied recognition of
Israel, gave Palestinians in the occupied lands a psychological
boost but brought few changes in their daily lives.
   The declaration was recognized by Arab and many Third World
countries but rejected by Israel and Western nations.
   Army radio reported that in the past week, troops raided more
than 400 West Bank villages and arrested scores of Palestinians
seen as potential inciters.
   An army official said the report was exaggerated.
   ``Certainly, there was an effort to go into many villages over
the past couple of months to look for wanted people,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``But I don't know anything about the army going into 400
villages,'' he said.
   The official said the army viewed widespread curfews as the most
effective way of preventing violence and insisted they were not
collective punishment.
   ``Curfews are not intended to wear down the population. That
type of claim could have been made two years ago, but that is not
at all the case today,'' he said.
   Troops dynamited three homes in Gaza's Bureij refugee camp of
Palestinians suspected of participating in the stoning death of an
Israeli soldier in the fall. The demolitions brought to 15 the
number of houses destroyed as punishment for the soldiers' killing.
   During the uprising, the army has destroyed or sealed more than
500 Palestinian homes to punish uprising suspects. Western
countries and international organizations have condemned the tactic
as a human rights violation.
   At least 773 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987.
   Fifty-two Israelis have died in the violence.
   In addition, 299 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration.

<TEXT>
   The man who tried to shoot at Soviet leaders
during last week's Revolution Day parade had been planning to kill
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for more than two years, Soviet news
reports said today.
   Alexander A. Shmonov, a 38-year-old unemployed man from
Leningrad, was charged with attempted terrorism in the Nov. 7
shooting on Red Square.
   Police say Shmonov managed to fire two shots, but was prevented
by police from targeting Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders, who
were observing the traditional military parade from atop Lenin's
Mausoleum. No one was hurt.
   Col. Pyotr Sokolov, a top KGB investigator, told the newspaper
Glasnost that a body search of Shmonov turned up a note confirming
that Gorbachev was his intended victim.
   ``The note was prepared in advance in case of his death during
the assassination attempt,'' Sokolov was quoted as saying in a Tass
news agency report of the interview. ``In the note, Shmonov
explicitly set out his criminal intentions as regards to the Soviet
president.''
   According to Glasnost, the shooting took place just 46 yards
from the mausoleum. Police said an officer had noticed Shmonov
pulling out a hunting rifle and aim at the Soviet leaders on the
mausoleum.
   The officer forced the gun barrel skyward before Shmonov fired
the two shots. He was then grabbed by more security men.
   ``Shmonov said he had been preparing this assassination attempt
for more than two years,'' Sokolov told the newspaper. ``During
that time, he acquired an imported double-barreled hunting rifle
and practiced rapid firing.''
   Another newspaper, Rabochaya Trybuna, said Shmonov had a hunting
license and bought the weapon legally for $1,600.
   ``He went to a public library to read about the correct way to
prepare a cartridge and asked some questions of hunters who were in
the store,'' the newspaper said.
   ``To carry the gun into Red Square, he sawed off the butt and
fixed a kind of pocket made of rubbery material inside his
jacket,'' the report said, quoting an official in the state
prosecutor's office.
   The newspaper said Shmonov, who is being held in a KGB
investigation ward, arrived in Moscow on Nov. 6 and rented an
apartment.
   ``The owner told him it wouldn't be easy to get into Red Square,
so he spent the night reading newspapers describing meeting places
for people participating in the parade,'' the newspaper said.
   Sgt. Andrei Mylnikov, the policeman who subdued Shmonov during
the shooting, said in an interview with Moscow News on Wednesday
that the gunman told investigators: ``I wanted to kill Gorbachev.''
   Shmonov joined a delegation from the Bauman region during the
parade marking the 73rd anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution.
   The shooting took place five minutes after Gorbachev, Yeltsin
and other officials returned to the mausoleum after marching with
pro-Communist demonstrators.
   The last reported attempt to assassinate a Soviet leader was in
1969, when a Red Army officer tried to kill party chief Leonid
Brezhnev.
   The gunman, Lt. Viktor Ilyin, missed and killed a chauffeur and
wounded three other people. He spent 21 years in a psychiatric
hospital and was released in February.

   Mickey Spillane has written a special
potboiler for South Carolina troops in Saudi Arabia, and those who
solve the mystery have a chance to win free air travel or hotel
accommodations.
   ``This little story is just a way to keep the guys reminded of
Myrtle Beach,'' said the author, a World War II fighter pilot and
resident of nearby Murrells Inlet.
   The mystery contest designed to entertain members of the 354th
Tactical Air Force, based at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, features
eight weekly installments with clues leading to the whereabouts of
a former South Carolina beauty queen after a fictional kidnapping.
   The story will be sent to military officials via facsimile
machine for distribution to the aspiring pulp-fiction detectives.
   Those who put together the clues qualify for a grand prize of
two round-trip air tickets and several runner-up prizes of hotel
accommodations.
   ``Once they get home, they'll be able to go on a vacation or
take a trip to visit their parents, whatever they want,'' said Maj.
John Elrod, who came up with the idea.

<HEAD>Local Officials Appeal for Government Help in Typhoon-Hit Areas</HEAD>

   Local officials today appealed for
help in areas ravaged by Typhoon Mike which killed more than 140
people as it swept across the central Philippine islands.
   Cebu, the country's second major port city, remained without
drinking water, telephones and electricity two days after the storm
struck, said Sen. John Osmena, who returned from the stricken area
350 miles southeast of Manila.
   Nearly 50 passenger, cargo and Philippine navy ships sank during
the storm, most of them in Cebu's port. Typhoon Mike's ferocious
winds also blew a Panamanian cargo ship, causing it to slam into
the Mactan bridge and making it unpassable to truckloads of
supplies in and out of the city.
   ``It's like we were hit by an atomic bomb,'' Osmena said after
returning to Manila. ``There is not a single electric pole nor tree
still standing up. Everything was blown down.''
   Osmena complained that there has been no help from the central
government despite President Corazon Aquino's declaration of a
state of calamity in Cebu and other provinces.
   ``I don't know what that declaration means,'' Osmena told
private radio DZXL. ``Up to now, we don't know what she has done
for us. This is the problem with this government. It dilly-dallys a
lot about everything.''
   He said there is a food shortage in Cebu province and water is
being rationed. Queues for gasoline and fuel were half a mile long,
he added.
   In nearby Negros Occidental, Cabinet members met with
businessmen who urged the government to supply the province with
fuel to salvage the prawn industry that was damaged by the typhoon.
   The typhoon destroyed $1.6 million worth of prawn ponds and
infrastructure needed by the industry, the island's second largest.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Cancels TV Shows After Priesthood Sex Reports</HEAD>

   Catholic officials have canceled plans
to allow a TV station to broadcast holiday church services
following the station's broadcast of a controversial report on sex
in the priesthood.
   Bishop Louis E. Gelineau of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Providence said the three-part series ``Love in the Rectory'' was
offensive and an injustice to Rhode Island's nearly 500 priests.
   The report by WPRI-TV included an interview with a former priest
who said he was not celibate and eventually married a former nun.
It also discussed cases involving priests convicted of having sex
with children.
   Galineau said he was canceling plans to have WPRI broadcast
Thanksgiving and Christmas services at which he was to say Mass.
   ``I must now re-evaluate the official relationship between
ourselves and your station,'' he said in a letter to Robert Finke,
the station's vice president and general manager. He also demanded
an on-air apology.
   The station, which said it received dozens of letters praising
and criticizing last week's series, issued a statement during
Tuesday's evening news program that offered a partial apology.
   ``If viewers were offended by the frankness of the series or its
title, we apologize, but Channel 12 felt the issue was one that
needed to be addressed,'' evening news anchorwoman Karen Adams
said.
   ``We felt it was necessary to run the story,'' Finke added in an
interview Wednesday.
   But Galineau complained that the series was packaged in a
``provocative way'' designed to boost ratings.
   ``I cannot ignore the fact this this is `sweeps week' and the
obvious connection between increased viewership and advertising
rates for the evening newscasts,'' he wrote. Sweeps week is a
period when competition for TV ratings is particularly fierce.

   Police say they have arrested a man known as the
``pope of pot'' whose drug ring sold about $40,000 worth of
marijuana a day through a toll-free number: 1-800-WANT-POT.
   Michael Cesar, 48, was arrested Wednesday with seven alleged
accomplices after narcotics officers raided an apartment, said
police spokesman Scott Bloch.
   During the raid, police confiscated at least 7 pounds of
marijuana and $3,000 in cash, Bloch said.
   Cesar, alleged head of the drug ring, said he belongs to an
organization called ``The Church of Realized Fantasies,'' Bloch
said.
   The operation, which took in $40,000 a day in marijuana sales,
received orders by telephone through the toll-free number, Bloch
said.
   Callers were directed to certain streetcorners in lower
Manhattan, to which couriers were then dispatched on bicycles to
deliver the order, he said.
   The eight arrested are all charged with conspiracy to sell
marijuana and criminal possession of marijuana, Bloch said.

<HEAD>Soviet Airliner Hijacked to Finland; Two Americans Aboard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who claimed he had a bomb
hijacked a Soviet airliner to Finland today and surrendered without
incident to authorities. Most of the passengers slept through the
ordeal.
   It was at least the seventh time a Soviet jet was commandeered
to Scandinavia this year by young Soviet men trying to flee their
country.
   Finnish police said the 31-year-old hijacker, who turned out to
be unarmed, offered no resistance at Helsinki Airport and asked for
political asylum.
   None of the Aeroflot jet's 65 passengers or six crew members was
injured. Two Americans were among the 15 Westerners aboard the
plane.
   ``Everything was very quiet when we left Leningrad at 5 a.m. and
I had no idea we had been hijacked until I saw flashing lights and
police cars outside on the runway,'' said Jack McLaughlin, a
businessman from Boston.
   ``I did see a young fella in red sneakers going up and down the
aisle a couple of times, but he looked no different from any normal
passenger,'' said Charles Erven of Racine, Wis.
   ``Most people were asleep anyway, so we didn't really know what
was going on until after we landed,'' he said.
   Police said the Soviet man hijacked the twin-engine Tupolev 134
while on a flight from Leningrad to Moscow, threatening to explode
``a plastic bomb.''
   Criminal Police Inspector Pertti Lehtonen said in an interview
that the hijacker had demanded to go to Stockholm, Sweden. It was
not immediately clear why the plane landed in Helsinki instead at
5:30 a.m.
   Lehtonen said the Western passengers had been heading for Moscow
to make international flight connections.
   Substitute flights were arranged in Helsinki and most of the
non-Soviet passengers had left by midday. The Americans were
heading for Prague.
   ``We were very fortunate ... I guess things could have turned
out really differently,'' Erven said.
   Lehtonen said the Soviet passengers and crew members would take
the Tupolev to Moscow after police questioned them.
   Erven and McLaughlin said they did not know about the repeated
hijackings of planes to Finland and Sweden this year by young men
trying to flee the Soviet Union. ``I was in a rush and would not
have taken the train in any case,'' McLaughlin said.

   Firefighters hoped lighter winds and
lower temperatures would linger long enough to help them battle a
34,000-acre timber and grass fire near the Missouri River.
   About two dozen hunters fled their backcountry camps late
Tuesday when the wind-whipped fire raged through the remote Gates
of the Mountains Wilderness and adjacent Beartooth Game Range in
western Montana.
   Lorraine Parrish, a spokeswoman at the Interagency Dispatch
Center near Helena, said the wind died down unexpectedly Wednesday,
and snow was falling on some areas of the fire.
   The fire broke out late Tuesday in the rugged Big Belt Mountains
about 35 miles northeast of Helena. Officials said record-high
temperatures, extremely dry conditions and winds as high as 30 mph
helped the fire spread before the situation improved Wednesday.
   Gov. Stan Stephens on Wednesday called out the National Guard to
help the 400 firefighters and support personnel fight the blaze.
   The cause hasn't been pinpointed, but officials think the blaze
may have started in a hunting camp.
   Lewis and Clark County authorities said all the hunters known to
have been in the area were accounted for, and no injuries had been
reported.
   Several hunters at the Elkhorn Creek campsite had no time to
leave and spent several hours lying in a creek, waiting for the
flames to pass.
   Others fled on horseback, leaving behind most of their
belongings, and spent the night trying to keep ahead of the blaze.
``We had a big fire going behind us to lighten things up,'' said
hunter Gary Phillipe. ``That baby, it was like a full moon.''
   Butch Hestekin of Great Falls said a wall of flames ``just
whipped across the tops of the trees'' at his hunting camp. In the
rush to save their lives, Hestekin's hunting party abandoned five
pickups and all their belongings.
   ``The cinders were falling on us,'' said Lynn Dumas, another
hunter. ``We had five minutes' warning - just about enough time to
saddle a horse.''
   At least 30 homes were evacuated east of Wolf Creek, and the
fire got within about two miles of the small town of Craig, which
is protected by the Missouri River.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is prepared for a
political battle when he addresses the legislature on Friday, but
is confident his views will prevail, the leader of Italy's
Communist Party says.
   Achille Occhetto, who met for 2{ hours with the Soviet leader,
said today that Gorbachev was candid about the problems, both
economic and political, facing the country and predicted that the
next 18 months would be crucial to the program of perestroika, as
Gorbachev's reform program is called.
   On Wednesday, angry members of the national legislature
abandoned the agenda set by the Supreme Soviet's Presidium and took
to the floor with demands that Gorbachev report to them on his
attempts to hold the country together and his recent meeting with
Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin.
   After 362 legislators out of 378 present voted in support of the
demand, Gorbachev agreed to address the Supreme Soviet on Friday,
Tass said.
   ``I feel Gorbachev is self-confident and ready for political
battle,'' Occhetto told reporters. ``I feel he will be the master
of the situation.''
   Occhetto said that Gorbachev told him that the next 18 months
would be extremely important for his economic and political reforms
and play ``a decisive role in the future of the country.''
   Tass, in a political commentary, said Friday's speech was
tantamount to a ``moment of truth'' and that Gorbachev would most
likely offer specific remedies to put new life into the moribund
economy.
   ``Will Gorbachev justify the expectations?'' the official news
agency said. ``The most radical-minded critics express doubt on
that score, pointing out that Gorbachev - a consumate master at
subtle multi-option moves - lacks resoluteness when hard decisions
need to be made.''
   On the other hand, Tass said, Gorbachev is making some headway
in his reform program given the many vital tasks that he must
perform, including time- consuming foreign affairs and domestic
disputes with the restive republics.

<HEAD>Risk from Tainted Transfusion High, Low for Health Care Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The risk to health care workers exposed to
AIDS through cuts is low but nine of 10 people who receive
AIDS-tained blood through transfusions will become infected by the
deadly virus, two studies say.
   The studies compare the minuscule amount transmitted through a
needle puncture to the relatively high amount of the AIDS virus
found in blood transfusions.
   In one study, researchers found that 90 percent of 124 people
who received tainted transfusions became infected with HIV, the
AIDS virus. Within three years, 13 percent developed AIDS,
researchers said.
   In a second study, scientists reported that health care workers
had a 0.56 percent chance of infection after they were injured and
exposed to the AIDS virus.
   The studies are published in today's Annals of Internal
Medicine.
   As of October, 154,917 Americans had contracted AIDS. Of those,
3,826, or 2.4 percent, were infected through transfusions. Three of
37 health care workers infected through occupational exposure have
developed the disease, said the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   For up to four years, researchers tracked recipients of blood
later found tainted by the AIDS virus.
   Of the 111 who became infected, nine have developed AIDS. Three
died. Almost half received transfusions for surgery.
   ``It's important not to have any illusions about how infectious
HIV is. If it's there (in the transfusion), you'll get it,'' said
the study's lead author, Dr. Elizabeth Donegan of the University of
California at San Francisco.
   Today, experts estimate one in 150,000 units of blood is
contaminated with AIDS.
   The risk to health-care workers is much smaller, according to
the second study. Of the 1,344 National Institutes of Health
workers reporting 179 cuts or punctures over six years, only one
became infected, said the study by NIH and Johns Hopkins
University.
   The study said 243 workers were exposed to the AIDS virus,
usually through splashes of patient fluids to the mouth or eyes.
None has shown signs of infection.
   ``There is a risk, but you have to keep that risk in
perspective,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. David Henderson of
the NIH.
   Health care workers who have begun wearing gloves, masks and
gowns for certain procedures should continue to do so, Henderson
said.
   And while health care officials may find the low risk
reassuring, they should not make light of those workers who fear
the risk.
   ``While the risk is small, there is some risk and the risk is
real,'' said AIDS researcher Dr. Robert Klein, co-author of an
editorial accompanying the two studies.

   Iraq said today it will try President
Bush for ``inhuman policies and planning aggression against the
people of Iraq.''
   The trial will begin Dec. 10 in Algiers in an Arab court, the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
   The agency quoted the secretary-general of the Arab Jurists
Federation, Shibeeb al-Maliky, as saying the proceedings would be
held in accordance with rules used by the Nuremberg courts that
tried Nazi war criminals.
   ``Mr. al-Maliky added that the court would listen to Iraqi, Arab
and international witnesses with regard to charges against Bush,''
INA said in a dispatch late Wednesday.
   The verdict will be relayed to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and international groups concerned with human
rights, the agency said.
   Officials in Baghdad announced in September that they would put
Bush on trial for alleged human rights violations after Western
leaders said President Saddam Hussein should be tried for war
crimes.
   The trial was postponed twice. Officials said they had
difficulty trying to organize sufficient witnesses and jurists to
hold the trial in Iraq.

   The son of Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan Jr. was ordered held without bail on a rape charge today
after prosecutors alleged he was a danger to society.
   The $2,500 bond set for Robert Jeffrey Lujan, 28, following his
arrest Wednesday night was revoked by Alexandria Judge Daniel
O'Flaherty.
   Prosecutor Randy Sengel argued that the younger Lujan should not
be free on bond because he was a danger to society. Sengel said
police have evidence Lujan broke into a woman's apartment while
armed and raped her. According to a police report, he was armed
with a shotgun.
   Lujan did not enter a plea to the charge. O`Flaherty scheduled a
preliminary hearing for Friday.
   Lujan's parents have said their son denied the allegation,
according to Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for the Interior
Department.
   ``Their son has told them that it (the sex) was consentual,''
Goldstein said late Wednesday. ``Mr. Lujan has determined that he
will not interfere with the due process of the law. He hasn't even
been down to the jail this evening because he does not want to give
any sense of impropriety.''
   Robert Mains, a police communications supervisor, said the
victim alleges the attack occurred about 4:30 a.m. Sunday in the
same high rise building where Lujan lives with his parents.
   Goldstein confirmed local television reports that the
unidentified victim told police she was raped after she awoke to
find a man burglarizing her home.
   His parents ``are quite concerned,'' Goldstein said. ``It's
difficult because he's secretary of the interior, but he's still a
parent.''
   ``It's a personal matter, and the secretary plans to go on with
business as usual,'' Goldstein said.

<HEAD>Plan to Charge Some Soviet Rail Passengers Hard Currency Scrapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government commission today ordered the Railroad
Ministry to cancel a plan that would have charged passengers hard
currency, rather than rubles, for train trips out of the country.
   The new pay schedule had been scheduled to begin today. The
policy would have been a hardship for many Soviets because the
official exchange rate makes it difficult for them to afford hard
currency.
   The government's Foreign Economic Commission, part of the
Council of Ministers, said the plan was ``unfounded'' and told the
railroad minister to rescind it. A Tass report on the development
gave no further explanation.
   The dispute between the two government bodies is another sign of
the growing dissension in the Kremlin.
   The Railroad Ministry had said it would take the step because it
had to pay foreign companies in hard currency for using their
railways.
   It said it had no foreign currency of its own to pay the bills,
so it was forced to ask passengers to pay in hard currency.
   At the same time, the state airline Aeroflot is considering
accepting only hard currency for trips abroad.

   War against Iraq could be a lesser evil than
allowing Saddam Hussein to get away with his aggression against
Kuwait, the Archbishop of Canterbury said today.
   ``The world faces a very somber situation,'' the archbishop,
Robert Runcie, told the General Synod of the state Church of
England.
   ``If it comes to war in the gulf crisis, non-combatants will
most certainly be killed and maimed and bereaved ... we must set
aside romantic ideas of a surgical strike,'' said Runcie, who was a
tank officer decorated for bravery in World War II.
   He said the economic sanctions on Iraq must be given time to
work. But, he added, ``despite all the horrors and misery that war
would certainly involve, we have to face the fact that it could be
the lesser of two evils.''
   ``Of one thing I am quite sure: whilst we must use every means
short of war to enforce the U.N. policy, it would be foolish to
rule out the use of force in the last resort.''
   The archbishop, spiritual head of the Church of England and
leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, was a Scots Guards
officer when he led a tank unit across the Rhine and into the
German heartland in 1945.
   He won the coveted Military Cross for rescuing one of his
crewmen who was trapped in a burning tank, and the next day he blew
up a German gun emplacement which had knocked out five tanks.
   In his presidential address to the synod's regular November
session, Runcie acknowledged that some members of the synod of 574
bishops, clergy and laity disagreed over whether military action
against Iraq was justifiable.
   ``Though war is only rarely just, it can be justifiable,'' he
said.
   He said that threatening Saddam with a war crimes trial, as
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has done, would not encourage him
to leave Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
beginning a new round of consultations with other nations as the
Bush administration tries to solidify support for its toughening
stand against Iraq.
   Baker will meet over the weekend with the foreign ministers of
three African countries as well as Romania and Finland. All are
members of the U.N. Security Council, where the administration
intends to seek approval to use force to liberate Kuwait if
peaceful approaches fail.
   The secretary told reporters at the White House on Wednesday
that his aim is to build ``an appropriate political and military
foundation'' to use force against Iraq. Many countries that share
U.S. disapproval of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait are reluctant to
go to war until diplomacy is given every chance to work.
   In Brussels, where he headed today, Baker will meet on Friday
with the 12-nation European Community, which is providing aid to
countries whose economies are suffering because of their adherence
to a trade embargo against Iraq.
   Last week, on a trip to the Persian Gulf and Europe, Baker lined
up the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France to go along with the
resolution. As permanent members of the Security Council they could
have killed it with their veto.
   The three African countries Baker is soliciting are Ethiopia,
Ivory Coast and Zaire. Enlisting them to support the United States
would give the toughened American stance broader approval among
neutral and Third World nations.
   Baker will meet with the African foreign ministers in Geneva on
Saturday. He then will fly to Paris and meet with the foreign
ministers of Romania and Finland. On Sunday, he will hold nother
session with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   From Monday through Thursday next week, Baker will assist
President Bush at a 34-nation summit in Paris, where a landmark
treaty to reduce NATO and Warsaw Pact tanks and other non-nuclear
weapons will be signed.
   After accompanying Bush to Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Baker will
then go to Colombia the following weekend to confer with President
Cesar Gaviria. Colombia also is a member of the Security Council
this month.
   At his news conference Wednesday, Baker said the administration
had not decided to use force, but wanted that ``hypothetical''
option to be credible in hopes of persuading Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to give up Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey and the exiled
government of Kuwait all assured Baker during his recent eight-day
trip to the Persian Gulf and Europe that they would not oppose the
resolution.
   In the meantime, King Hassan of Morocco is trying to organize an
Arab summit to head off war with diplomacy.
   ``We are in favor of any diplomatic approaches that can move us
in the direction of a political and peaceful'' settlement, Baker
said. ``But we are not in favor of diplomatic approaches that call
for partial solutions.''
   Baker was referring to the longstanding U.S. demand that Iraq
withdraw its troops unconditionally from Kuwait before any
discussion on related issues are held. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S.
ally against Saddam, has taken the same position with regard to an
Arab summit.

   Police fired bullets and tear gas today
to quell rioting Hindus and Moslems who fought each other with
knives, stones and glass bottles. At least 12 people were injured,
police said.
   A day earlier, the wave of religious violence sweeping the
nation touched the capital for the first time when armed Sikh and
Moslem mobs attacked Hindus and pillaged their houses, killing at
least six people, police said.
   Also Wednesday, Sikh separatists in Punjab state shot and killed
seven bus passengers after hijacking the vehicle at gunpoint,
police said today.
   More than 385 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed
nationwide in the religious violence sweeping India over the past
month.
   No deaths were reported in violence today in two predominantly
Hindu neighborhoods of the capital. In another part of the New
Delhi, Sikh youths stoned buses and Hindu-owned shops.
   In Sadar Bazaar, a middle-class neighborhood and the flashpoint
of Wednesday's violence, Moslems set fire to a Hindu's bicycle
repair shop today, residents said on condition of anonymity.
   Hindu mobs retaliated by setting fire to a monument at a Moslem
saint's grave and two nearby Moslem houses, other residents said.
   No one was injured in the incidents, but enraged residents
hurled stones, soda water bottles and waved knives and daggers at
each other. Police fired into the air and used tear gas to disperse
the mobs, police said.
   ``We have now learned how to live. They (the Hindus) have
removed the fear of death from our hearts,'' said Zahid Hussain, a
meat exporter, speaking on the terrace of his two-story house.
   On the street below, a car had been smashed, its seats and
stereo ripped out. Shattered glass and bricks carpeted the road.
   Deputy Commissioner of Police Bhimsen Bhassi said six people
were wounded in the police firing and five people were injured in
the stone throwing.
   Earlier, police used bamboo canes to disperse Hindu residents
who defied a curfew and came out of their houses to hurl stones and
soda water bottles.
   At least one person, a middle-aged Hindu man, was seen bleeding
from the head after police lashed out with their canes to disperse
the crowd.
   In Tilak Nagar, 10 miles southwest of Sadar Bazaar, Sikh
students hurled stones at buses and Hindu-owned shops after their
principal made an anti-Hindu speech today, a police official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the mob
of about 800 youths damaged eight buses and six shops in Tilak
Nagar, a predominantly Hindu middle-class neighborhood.
   Wednesday's trouble began when about 15,000 Sikhs and Moslems
held a meeting in a mosque to express solidarity of India's
minorities against rising fundamentalism by part of the Hindu
majority.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent, while Sikhs are about 2 percent. Most
of the rest are Christians or Buddhists.
   It is the first time in recent memory that Sikhs and Moslems
have banded together against Hindus. The Sikh religion has roots in
Hinduism and Islam.
   Bhassi said many of the Moslems and Sikhs at Wednesday's meeting
were armed with knives, daggers, swords and pistols and they later
attacked Hindus living near the mosque.
   He said two Hindus and one Moslem died of stab wounds, two
Moslems died of bullet wounds and a Hindu police officer died after
being hit on the head with a stone. Press Trust of India put the
toll at seven but gave no details. At least 25 people, including
seven policemen, were injured.
   Clashes between Hindus and Moslems peaked two weeks ago when
Hindus stormed a mosque in Ayodhya. Hindus want to build a temple
on the site, which they claim is the birthplace of Lord Rama, a
popular Hindu god.
   In Punjab, four Sikhs in a jeep blocked the bus near the village
of Katora, said regional Senior Superintendent of Police Anil
Sharma. They then forced the motorist to drive the bus off the main
road and opened fire on the passengers.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent nation in
Punjab since 1983, blaming Hindus for discrimination. At least
2,770 people have died in the separatist campaign this year.

   Gainesville murder suspect Edward Lewis
Humphrey was sentenced today to the maximum 22 months for beating
his grandmother after his lawyer said no private psychiatric
hospital could be found for him.
   Circuit Judge Theron Yawn said last week he was inclined to
order a mental commitment rather than prison for Humphrey. But
Public Defender J.R. Russo said today that some hospitals rejected
Humphrey outright and the only ones that would admit him would
charge $600 to $1,000 a day, more than the family could afford.
   Humphrey, 19, nodded when his 79-year-old grandmother blew him
as kiss as he entered the courtroom but was generally oblivious to
the proceedings.
   He mostly stared off into space as the judge imposed the maximum
prison term, to be served, at least at the start, in the prison
system's psychiatric facility.
   Humphrey, a sometime University of Florida student with a
history of mental problems, has been labeled a suspect in the
slayings of five students near the campus in Gainesville during the
last week in August. But he has not been charged in those cases.
   Humphrey has been jailed on $1 million bond since the beating
Aug. 30.
   His grandmother, Elna Hlavaty, told a deputy that night that her
grandson had beaten and chowill go toward electricity generation rather
than home
heating and industrial uses.
   TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., one of Iroquois' several owners,
estimated the new line will generate $1 billion per year in exports
for Canada. Canada has been supplying natural gas to the United
States since the 1960s, but mostly in the West and Midwest.

<TEXT>
   Sexual barriers in America are coming down
slowly but surely, even though there is still a long way to go,
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor says.
   ``We will have a female president some day,'' O'Connor said.
``But we're not there yet.''
   ``As society sees what women can do, and as women see what women
can do, there will be more women out there doing things, and we'll
all be better off for it,'' O'Connor told students Wednesday at
Washington University in St. Louis.
   As more women enter fields such as law, medicine and olitics,
more women will become influential members of society, she said.
   ``Power is the ability to do. It is in this sense that women can
become increasingly powerful,'' said O'Connor, the first woman to
serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   There are still too few women judges, O'Connor said. She cited
figures showing that less than 10 percent of federal judicial
officers and state appeals judges are women.
   Women make up 20 percent of all lawyers, but are only 6 percent
of law firm partners and 11 percent of tenured law professors, she
said.
   O'Connor gave the keynote address at a conference, sponsored by
the Monticello College Foundation and Washington University,
titled: ``Women in power; is the view different?''

<TEXT>
   The National League of Cities will consider
moving its 1991 convention from Phoenix because the state does not
have a paid holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., league
officials said.
   The league's board will decide whether to move its convention
during a meeting Dec. 1 in Houston, said Don Borut, the league's
executive director.
   Last week, Arizona voters rejected two propositions that would
have created a statewide paid King Day. As a result, the National
Football League has threatened to pull the 1993 Super Bowl out of
the state.
   The National League of Cities' board voted in 1987 to hold the
1991 convention in Phoenix, but with the condition that the
decision would be reconsidered if Arizona did not create a paid
King holiday.
   ``I was advised that we have a very long and uphill road to
climb'' to keep the convention, said Phoenix Mayor Paul Johnson.
   Johnson blamed rival cities that are interested in having the
event for the movement to pull the convention from Phoenix.
   Larry Hilliard, vice president of the Phoenix &amp; the Valley of
the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau, said Wednesday, ``It has
not been canceled and we're still maintaining a dialogue with the
National League of Cities.
   The convention is expected to draw 10,000 visitors and to
generate $6.9 million in revenues, Hilliard said.
   Johnson said he and City Council members will lobby board
members by phone and at the Houston convention, stressing that
Phoenix has a paid King holiday.

   A new law requiring states to suspend the
driver's licenses of all convicted drug offenders or lose some
federal highway funds may not help the war on drugs, an official of
the National Governors' Association says.
   There is no data proving that mandatory license suspensions,
imposed first in New Jersey, prompts people to turn away from
drugs, said Nolan Jones, staff director for the association's
justice and public safety committee.
   ``It sounds like a good idea, but let's see if it's working''
before forcing every state to enact similar rules, Jones said.
   The measure, included in the fiscal 1991 transportation
appropriations bill, applies to all states and all illegal drugs,
including the 10 states where possession of small amounts of
marijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered an
infraction of the law.
   The legislation drew little attention when it was approved
during a flurry of activity Oct. 27 as Congress rushed to leave
town. President Bush signed it into law Nov. 5.
   The bill calls for withholding 5 percent of federal highway
funds starting Oct. 1, 1993 from states that fail to require
six-month driver's license suspensions for everyone convicted of
any drug offense. The cut would increase to 10 percent on Oct. 1,
1995.
   ``Numerous states have driver's license revocation laws, but
they don't go as far as this calls for,'' Jones said in an
interview. ``That points to why we are against the whole issue of
mandates when looking at this sort of problem.''
   About half the states allow suspension of drug offenders'
licenses, but only four require such suspensions for drivers of all
ages and only New Jersey has a six-month minimum, according to the
American Legislative Exchange Council. The minimum is four months
in Georgia and three months in Colorado and Pennsylvania.
   The legislation does have a way out for states that want all
their federal highway funds but don't want to require license
suspensions: their legislatures must vote specifically against
requiring the suspensions and their governors must go on record in
agreement with that position.
   ``This forces the states to be accountable,'' said a Bush
administration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We're
not going to force you, but if you don't want to do it, you'll have
to be public about it.''
   In states where they can't agree - for example, the governor
wants to suspend licenses but at least one chamber of the state
legislature does not - the federal highway funds would be cut.
   The measure's sponsor, Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., said
his main targets were New York and California, which have
decriminalized minor marijuana possession.
   Both states also have splits in party control: In California,
the Democrats control the legislature and the governor is a
Republican; in New York, the governor is a Democrat and his party
controls the state assembly while Republicans control the state
senate.
   Arnold S. Trebach, president of the Drug Policy Foundation and
an American University professor of public affairs, said the
measure ``is only one of many passed during recent anti-drug war
hysteria that is creating a police state in America in the name of
controlling drugs.''
   ``People are soon going to realize that what their legislators
have created for them under the drug laws is an absolutely
intolerable situation,'' said Trebach, whose foundation urges
treating drug abuse as a medical issue, not a law enforcement
problem.
   Solomon said he pushed the measure to crack down on casual drug
users.
   ``Seventy-five percent of the drug purchases in America are done
by casual drug users, and that's white, upper-middle-class
Americans that drive their Pontiac Firebirds into the ghetto and
buy these killer drugs,'' Solomon said.
   ``You don't see the murders take place out in the suburbs, but
it's the casual drug user who supplies the demand for these
drugs,'' he said. ``If you do away with the demand for drugs, then
the drugs will dry up in this country. ... When it starts to affect
their livelihoods, maybe then they'll stop using these drugs.''
   The license suspensions won't necessarily affect their
livelihoods, however, because they could receive limited permits
enabling them to continue commuting to work, Solomon said.
   The money at stake is substantial.
   The Federal Highway Administration will distribute some $12.3
billion to the states this year. Of that total, California will get
the biggest slice, some $1.1 billion. New York will get $666
million.

   A minor earthquake shook pictures off
walls in two central Oklahoma communities early today but experts
said there was no connection with a potential major quake on the
New Madrid Fault.
   The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the quake registered 3.6 on
the Richter scale of ground movement. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can
cause slight damage. A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest
normally felt by humans.
   The National Weather Service said it had received reports of a
tremor about 5:45 a.m. that was felt in Rush Springs, about 40
miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and Lindsay, about 28 miles south
of Oklahoma City. The geological survey said the quake was centered
5 miles north of Lindsay.
   ``Police departments in those areas indicate that pictures fell
from walls, objects were knocked off tables and out of cabinets and
many residents were awakened,'' the weather service said in a
statement.
   Geological survey director Charles Mankin said earthquakes are
common in Oklahoma, with a couple a week detected by sensitive
seismographs.
   ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6,'' he said. ``But a small
earthquake in that area is not unusual.''
   Larry Thompson of KBLP radio in Lindsay said the station was
flooded with calls after the tremor was felt.
   At the police department, dispatcher Lois Knapp said the shaking
lasted about two seconds.
   ``This police department is cement and brick and rock, and it
moved,'' she said.
   There has been increased concern about a Midwestern earthquake
since a New Mexico climatologist projected that there could be a
major one in early December along the New Madrid Fault, which runs
from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark. The projection, based on the
fact that tidal forces will be particularly strong early next
month, is disputed by most scientists.
   Mankin said there was no link between today's quake and the New
Madrid Fault.
   ``Most of the earthquakes in Oklahoma we have not been able to
relate to faults,`` Mankin said. ``They're very shallow earthquakes
and we know they're from some ground adjustment, obviously, but we
can't relate them to some fault.''
   In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the
Richter scale struck the New Madrid Fault, ringing church bells in
Washington, D.C., more than 850 miles away.
   Jim Lawson, chief geophysicist at the geological survey, said
earlier this week that even if a major quake occurred along the New
Madrid Fault, its effect in Oklahoma would be negligible.

<HEAD>U.S., Saudi Forces Begin Exercise in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads thruout to UPDATE with amphibious landing exercise
beginning. Edits to trim. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER BURNS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Saudi forces today began a six-day amphibious exercise
in the Persian Gulf, codenamed ``Imminent Thunder'' and involving
1,000 U.S. Marines, 1,100 aircraft and 16 ships.
   Iraq has termed the exercise a ``provocative act'' because it is
being held close to occupied Kuwait.
   Also today, Syria and Egypt rejected a proposed Arab summit on
the Persian Gulf crisis, effectively killing chances for the
gathering that Morocco's king said was possibly the last chance for
peace.
   Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
became the latest Arab leaders to join Saudi Arabia in rejecting
the summit. They said they were doing so because Baghdad insisted
upon keeping Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it would not participate in the
summit unless Baghdad promised beforehand to leave Kuwait, which it
invaded Aug. 2.
   In other developments:
   -Two American diplomats arrived in Amman, Jordan, on today's
regularly scheduled flight from Baghdad. The State Department said
on Wednesday two Americans were to leave Iraq, but did not release
their identities or further details.
   ``I'm not a hostage,'' said one, who was carrying an orange bag
that looked like a diplomatic pouch. Two other Americans arrived
from Iraq on Wednesday.
   -Hundreds of America's most powerful tanks began rolling into
the Saudi desert, adding more power to the growing U.S. deployment
in Saudi Arabia as Washington seeks U.N. authorization to wage war
on Iraq.
   -A poll sponsored by an arms-control group found that most
Americans oppose going to war without a congressional declaration
and nearly half prefer to give a U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with
Iraq more time.
   -The state Iraqi News Agency announced that President Bush will
go ``on trial'' in absentia next month in Algeria for ``inhuman
policies and planning aggression against the people of Iraq.''
   The trial will begin Dec. 10 in Algiers in an international
court of justice, INA said. It quoted the secretary-general of the
Arab Jurists Federation, Shibeeb al-Maliky, as saying the trial
would be held in accordance with rules used by the Nuremberg courts
that tried Nazi war criminals.
   The exact location of Imminent Thunder was not revealed because
of military policy, and a news blackout was imposed for the initial
phases of the operation.
   No live ammuniton will be fired in the operation. But it will
involve the largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise
since U.S. forces were deployed in the region in August.
   There have been three previous amphibious exercises in the
Persian Gulf, but they were believed to have been held further
south. The Washington Times reported on Wednesday that Imminent
Thunder would be held 10 miles from Kuwait. Iraq called that a
provocation.
   The first of several hundred khaki-colored M1A1 Abrams tanks, to
be repainted in desert camouflage, rolled off a ship in Saudi
Arabia on Wednesday night. The tanks will replace M1 tanks in all
front-line Army units in the country, with better protection from
chemical and biological warfare, a larger gun and thicker armor.
They will face Iraq's Soviet-made tanks.
   ``The M1 is better than anything the Iraqis have,'' said Army
spokesman Maj. Douglas Bidle, 38, of Arlington Heights, Ill. ``The
M1 gave us an edge. This is a better tank, so obviously this is an
even better edge.''
   Jane's Defense Weekly reported last month that 350 M1s would be
swapped for M1A1s. The Pentagon has said all tanks will be switched
by the end of the year.
   About 230,000 U.S. troops have massed in the region, joined by
about 100,000 soldiers from more than two dozen other nations
standing up to Iraq.
   The Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, on Wednesday accused the
United States of seeking to dominate the world oil market.
   ``The main U.S. objective in the region is to control oil wells
and dictate oil policies,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
Aziz as saying.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Tuesday that a
worldwide recession could result if Iraq is permitted to gain
control of the Persian Gulf's vast oil reserves.
   Last week, Baker won qualified support from the Soviet Union,
China, and France for a U.N. resolution authorizing the use of
force to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait. They are permanent members
of the Security Council with Britain and the United States, and as
such could veto any resolution.
   Chinese diplomatic sources said last week the Chinese foreign
minister, visiting Baghdad, told Iraqi officials China would not
veto a resolution authorizing force.
   But today, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it had not told
Baghdad how it would vote. It said the issue was not even raised.
   It was not clear whether the Chinese government was simply
unwilling to show its hand, in keeping with its usual policy, or
whether the diplomatic sources were incorrect.
   Some congressional Democrats are counseling Bush to give
international sanctions as much as 18 months before considering an
attack.
   The new poll, sponsored by The Professionals' Coalition for
Nuclear Arms Control, indicates most Americans are opposed to going
to war even if the standoff has not changed by January.
   It found that 62 percent of the 1,020 people interviewed approve
of Bush's handling of the crisis, but that 71 percent think
Congress must approve sending U.S. troops into battle.
   The national telephone survey found that 44 percent favor
continuing the economic sanctions even if the situation remains
unresolved by February. Fourteen percent favored a U.S. withdrawal.
   Thirty-eight percent believe the United States should attack
Iraq.
   The survey, conducted Friday through Tuesday, had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points.

   A summary of the Christian heritage in America
was modified by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops today to recognize
abuses that occurred in the early days.
   The document, ``Heritage and Hope: Evangelization in America,''
was drawn up to mark next year's 500th anniversary of Christopher
Columbus' landing on these shores.
   Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy of Miami, head of a committee that
drafted the pastoral letter commemorating the coming of Europeans
to America, said it has undergone major revisions.
   It deals with concerns of ``native Americans, Hispanics, blacks,
Asians,'' he said, adding that putting it together has been a
``learning experience.''
   ``We do not glorify every act of the church,'' he said. ``We do
not excuse our mistakes.'' But the document also brings out
Christianity's positive contributions in early America.
   McCarthy said it is urgent that the positive side be heard in
marking the anniversary. He told the annual meeting of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops:
   ``Already strong forces have gathered to characterize
Christianity in the ugliest terms while the reality of the church's
commitment in the Americas is unparalleled in the annals of human
history.
   ``For good or bad, our history is as it was, but the future
opens before us and beckons us to bring Christ into generations
born and unborn.''
   The bishops yesterday adopted their first comprehensive
guidelines on human sexuality, calling it a ``wonderful gift'' and
emphasizing chaste disciplines to nurture it.
   ``We do not fear sexuality, we embrace it,'' the bishops said in
both lauding that universal human endowment and reaffirming
traditional church restraints in expressing it.
   In the 185-page assessment of sexuality, approved Wednesday to
guide education on the subject, the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops added:
   ``We are dealing with a divine gift, a primal dimension of each
person, a mysterious blend of spirit and body, which shares in
God's own creative love and life ....
   ``What we fear at times is our own inability to think as highly
of the gift as does the God who made us sexual human beings.''
   While maintaining long-established church disapproval of
premarital and extramarital sexual intercourse, the document does
so in gentle, reasoned tones, and somewhat tempers past strictures
against homosexuality.
   ``Such an orientation, because not freely chosen, is not
sinful,'' said an amendment added in a motion by Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago and several others.
   It came after Bishop Raymond W. Lessard of Savannah, Ga., sought
unsuccessfully to insert a 1986 Vatican declaration calling
homosexuality a ``strong tendency'' toward `intrinsic moral evil''
and an ``objective disorder.''
   Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco called that a
philosophical analysis that has been misunderstood as meaning such
people were ``intrinsically disordered and bad.''
   ``Every human being has some disordered tendency,'' such as
toward anger and greed, Quinn said.
   The Vatican statement was put in a footnote, along with an
explanation that it was not meant to demean individuals. It has
caused ``untold damage,'' pushing ``many over the brink to confront
the church head-on,'' said Auxiliary Bishop Peter A. Rosazza of
Hartford, Conn.
   Another flurry erupted over the document's reiteration of the
church ban on contraception. Surveys indicate that a large
proportion of Catholics reject the ban.
   Bishop Kenneth E. Untener of Saginaw, Mich., noting that
dissenters are asked to prayerfully reconsider, said they might
respond: ``We will if you will.''
   He said the Holy Spirit acts through people, the sense of the
faithful, and the bishops had better listen to them to maintain the
church's credibility. ``If we don't, it will cause great damage to
the church at large,'' he said.
   Several bishops sharply criticized the guidelines, saying
parents had not been widely consulted and predicting that many
would pull their children out of Catholic schools because of them.

   Four black adults were killed
and two children wounded today when gunmen fired on a family
sleeping in a minibus at a violence-torn squatter camp near
Johannesburg, police said.
   The assailants used AK-47 assault rifles in the pre-dawn attack
at the Zonkwezizwe squatter camp southeast of Johannesburg, police
said.
   Three women and a man were killed, and a 4-year-old child and
8-month-old baby were seriously wounded.
   Police gave no motive for the attack, but 16 people, including
the latest victims, have been killed in factional fighting at the
camp in the past week.
   Authorities did not say why the people were sleeping in the
minibus, but the squatter camp is overcrowded and shelter is in
short supply.
   More than 800 blacks have died in factional fighting outside
Johannesburg since August.
   Most of the violence has been between supporters of the African
National Congress led by Nelson Mandela and Zulus who back the
Inkatha Freedom Party. Both sides oppose apartheid, but differ over
tactics and plans for a future South Africa.
   Police also said authorities found the body of a black man who
had been stabbed to death in Wembezi, northwest of Durban.

   Syria, Egypt and Kuwait today joined
Saudi Arabia in rejecting a proposed Arab summit on the Persian
Gulf crisis, effectively killing efforts to bring Arab leaders
together to avert war.
   Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said
Baghdad's insistence on keeping Kuwait made it necessary for them
to reject the meeting.
   The Kuwaiti government - exiled in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia - also
voiced its objections to the meeting today because of Iraq's
refusal to withdraw.
   The summit was proposed Sunday by King Hassan II of Morocco, who
called it a ``last chance'' for peace.
   ``Presidents Assad and Mubarak expressed their regret over
Iraq's rejection of any political settlement that aims at restoring
the situation in Kuwait to what it was prior to Aug. 2,'' said a
statement released by Assad's spokesman.
   Both Syria and Egypt have contributed troops to the
300,000-strong U.S.-led multinational force confronting Iraq, which
invaded and annexed Kuwait Aug. 2.
   On Wednesday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal,
said the only way a summit could succeed would be for Iraq to agree
in advance to withdraw from Kuwait. Iraq has made clear it would
not make such a promise.
   The Soviet Union sent high-level envoys to the Middle East this
week, among efforts to promote the summit.
   Before leaving Rabat, Morocco, today after a three-day visit,
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said: ``The
essential is to act quickly for a peaceful solution. It's not too
late, but time is pressing.''
   The Kuwaiti and Saudi government have said that an Arab solution
has already been proposed - by an Arab League summit in August that
ended in disarray. At that meeting, 12 of the 21 League members
voted to condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and approve the dispatch
of foreign forces o defend Saudi Arabia.
   Iraq, Libya and the PLO voted against the resolution. Jordan,
Sudan and Mauritania had reservations, and Algeria and Yemen
abstained. Tunis was not present.

   Pilot error is suspected in the crash
of an Italian jetliner trying to land at Zurich's international
airport, killing all 46 people aboard, including six Americans,
authorities said today.
   The Alitalia DC-9, arriving on a 50-minute flight from Milan,
skimmed treetops before its fiery crash into a wooded hillside on
Wednesday night, five miles short of Kloten airport, police said.
   Josef Meier, a spokesman for Swiss air traffic control
authorities, told a news conference that witness accounts suggested
several causes for the crash and that no possible theories,
including terrorism, were being ruled out.
   But Meier said radar data ``suggest the pilot misjudged his
altitude.'' He said the plane was flying about 1,000 feet below the
normal altitude during the landing approach.
   He said the plane was not yet within reach of an airport radar
beacon enabling it to lock onto a landing path.
   Radio contact was normal until two minutes before the crash and
controllers received no distress signal, officials said.
   The Swiss Federal Meteorological Office said visibility at the
time of the crash was good - up to 10 miles, with light rain and
light winds.
   Investigators reported finding one of the two flight recorders,
or ``black boxes,'' which track flight data and cockpit
conversations and hoped to learn more about the crash's cause from
them.
   About 300 police and rescuers worked at the muddy crash site
today, salvaging wreckage and retrieving charred bodies for
identification.
   Officials said all 40 passengers and six Italian crew members
were killed. In Rome, a preliminary count by the airline said six
U.S. citizens were among the dead, but the passenger list it
released gave only last names and first initials without
nationalities.
   The jet cut a swath into the forest and broke up on impact,
witnesses said. Smoking pieces of wreckage, covered with
firefighting foam, were strewn around a muddy hillside.
   ``The plane was burning like a volcano,'' said Hanni Steffen, a
resident and medic who rushed to the crash site.
   Debris was strewn over an area of 50 by 120 yards, police said.
   Alitalia identified the American victims as Karel Forman,
Stephen Ritter, John Stuckey, Paul Vaughan, William Briggs and
Jerry Bass. It had no further information.
   Three of the Americans worked for the Mobil Corp. in Macedon,
N.Y.: Briggs, 52, of Newark; Forman, 32, of Clifton Springs, N.Y.;
and Vaughan, 38, of Fairport, N.Y. The company provided their ages
and hometowns.
   A team of Italian investigators sent by Interior Minister
Vincenzo Scotti arrived early today to help in the inquiry. At
Linate Airport in Milan, where the flight originated, officials set
up a crisis unit to provide information and take calls from worried
families and friends.
   Alitalia said the DC-9 was built in 1974 and was last inspected
Nov. 4.
   Flight commander Raffaele Liberta, 47, was a 20-year Alitalia
veteran who had flown more than 10,000 hours during his career.
   The last major crash involving an Italian airliner occurred Oct.
15, 1987, when an ATR-42 turboprop of the carrier ATI, an Alitalia
subsidiary, crashed near Como on a flight from Milan to Cologne,
Germany, killing 37.

<TEXT>
   China has conveyed through the United
States that it will veto any attempt by South Korea to gain
separate membership in the United Nations, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Joongang Daily News said in a Washington-datelined story
that the United States, acting on a South Korean request, had asked
if the Beijing government would block an effort by Seoul to join
the world body this year.
   South Korea and its rival, Communist North Korea, currently hold
observer status in the 159-member world body. South Korea has no
diplomatic relations with China, which is closely allied with North
Korea.
   North Korea opposes separate U.N. membership for the two Korean
states, claiming such a measure would perpetuate the division of
the peninsula. Instead, it has proposed that both Koreas share a
single U.N. seat with revolving representation.
   Since improving ties with the Soviet Union and China, South
Korean officials have said they would stand a better chance of
joining the United Nations. They have indicated they would apply
for U.N. membership this year.
   The Soviet Union and China have veto powers as permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council.
   South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the
Soviet Union Oct. 30. Last month, it signed an accord to exchange
trade offices with China.

   Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem
cleric renewed his appeal today for the release of all hostages
held in Lebanon, calling their detention inhumane.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual mentor of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, spoke to reporters after
meeting the relatives of four Iranians missing in Lebanon.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for
the Shiite extremist factions holding most of the 13 Western
hostages in Lebanon, including six Americans.
   Fadlallah made several such statements in the past that appeared
to have had no immediate impact on the kidnappers, despite the
weight of his religious position.
   However, when a group calling itself The Organization of Islamic
Dawn released former American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank
Reed in April, it said its reasons included the ``behests of senior
religious leaders.''
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today sentenced Jose Dionisio
Suarez Esquivel to 12 years in prison for conspiring to assassinate
onetime Chilean Ambassador Orlando Letelier.
   Suarez admitted in September that he gave a blasting cap to
former Chilean intelligence agent Michael V. Townley, who allegedly
masterminded the assassination.
   Letelier and an associate, Ronni Moffitt, were killed Sept. 21,
1976, when a bomb exploded beneath his car on Embassy Row.
Letelier, Chile's ambassador to Washington from 1971 to 1973, was
an outspoken critic of the right-wing military government of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Defense attorney Paul Goldberger asked the judge to ``show some
leniency'' in sentencing Suarez, noting that he has a wife and an
infant son. ``This is not the type of case in which the parole
board would give him an early parole,'' Goldberger said.
   But U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. said the victims
should be remembered.
   ``I could not forget them,'' Robinson said. ``Don't think his
(Letelier's family didn't love him any less. I also could nt
forget Ronni Moffit and her husband.''
   Under a plea agreement approved by Robinson, Suarez, 51, faced a
maximum 12 years in prison for his role in the crime. Under the
agreement, authorities dropped charges against Elizabeth Gongora
Suarez, his wife, of concealing a fugitive, officials said.
   Goldberger argued that Townley, the alleged mastermind behind
the plot, received only 10 years, and former Chilean army Maj.
Armando Fernandez Larios received just seven years. Goldberger told
the court it would not be fair to give Suarez more time than the
others.
   Fernandez defected from Chile in 1987 and pleaded guilty to
being an accessory after the fact in the conspiracy. Fernandez
implicated two of his superiors in the Chilean intelligence agency
and Pinochet in the coverup of the Chilean military's involvement
in the crime.
   The two Chilean military officials have been charged with
participating in the killing but the Chilean government has refused
to extradite the men.
   Pinochet remains head of the Chilean army and military courts
have jurisdiction over the two officials, Gen. Juan Manuel
Contreras Sepulveda and retired Lt. Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, the
former head of the Chilean intelligence agency.
   Outside the courtroom, Goldberger said ``the appropriate
sentence would have been no more than Townley got.'' However, he
added that Robinson was a fair judge who merely decided on the
maximum prison term.

Treaty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators reached
tentative agreement today on reducing non-nuclear weapons in
Europe, diplomats said.
   Hungary's chief negotiator, Ambassador Istvan Gyarmati, said the
last minor disagreements were worked out at a plenary meeting of
the 22 nations belonging to the two military alliances.
   Other diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
a tentative agreement had been reached.
   The treaty allows each side to keep 20,000 battle tanks. It also
limits each to 30,000 armored combat vehicles, 20,000 pieces of
artillery, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters.
   With the treaty scheduled for signing in Paris on Monday - the
first day of the 34-nation Conference on Security and European
Cooperation - diplomats at the Vienna talks had been under pressure
to reach agreement.
   U.S. officials said in Washington on Wednesday that substantive
questions remained, including verification that the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact actually were destroying tanks,
anti-aircraft guns and other non-nuclear weaponry.
   But negotiators in Vienna said the issues were relatively minor,
and U.S. officials predicted the treaty would be ready for signing
on Monday.
   Gyarmati said negotiating teams had sent copies of the draft
agreement to their capitals, and senior officials there had until
later today to register objections.
   After that, the treaty would be considered final. Chief
negotiators were scheduled to initial copies Sunday before the
accord is signed a day later.
   According to the treaty, in January 1989 the Warsaw Pact had
51,500 tanks and Nato had about 16,400; the Warsaw Pact had about
22,400 armored combat vehicles, NATO 4,100; the Pact had 43,400
pieces of artillery and NATO had 14,400. In addition, the Warsaw
Pact had 3,700 helicopters and Nato had 2,400.

<TEXT>
   Nigerian jets from a West African
task force bombed Liberia's rebel-held port of Buchanan, and the
rebels said several people were killed and a U.S. relief ship
destroyed.
   Nigerian Ambassador Joshua Iroha, the chief political
representative of a five-nation West African army in Liberia,
confirmed Wednesday's bombing. He said the raid was to stop weapons
shipments to rebels led by Charles Taylor.
   The task force ``is not obliged to tell anyone when it is
carrying out military operations, and whoever was at the port of
Buchanan when the bombing was carried out was just unlucky,'' Iroha
said in an interview.
   ``There are more weapons in the containers at the port of
Buchanan than food ... any international relief organization that
wants to help Liberians must use the free port of Monrovia,'' he
said at his base in Freetown.
   The U.S. ship was carrying relief supplies of food. It was not
immediately known how many people were aboard the ship or what
happened to them.
   The West Africans have forced Taylor's rebels out of Monrovia,
where there are between 150,000 and 200,000 civilians. Most people
in Liberia are behind the lines of Taylor's guerrillas, and
Buchanan has the largest concentration of civilians after Monrovia.
   Humanitarian organizations like the U.S. Catholic Relief
Services and the Belgian branch of Doctors without Borders have
been working on both sides to aid people dying of starvation,
disease and, lately, from the West African bombing raids.
   Three warring Liberian armies have killed about 10,000 civilians
since rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 23. More than half of
the population of 2.3 million has fled the country or is displaced
inside Liberia.
   It was not possible to get independent confirmation of the
casualties in Wednesday's bombing.

   An earthquake shook Manila and the
Philippines' northern province Thursday, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties.
   The quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale, according to Leo
Bautista, a spokesman of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology
and Seismology. She said the epicenter was about 31 miles northeast
of Manila.
   An earthquake that measured 7.7 on the Richter scale on the same
fault line, the Philippine fault line, killed nearly 1,700 people
and caused widespread destruction in the northern Philippines in
July.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one digit means the ground motion is
10 times greater. A magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.

   Six people have died of cholera in north
Lebanon and 35 others have been hospitalized with symptoms of the
deadly intestinal disease, health authorities said Thursday.
   The Islamic Hospital in Tripoli, the provincial capital of north

leaking sewage that contaminated wells in Tripoli and two nearby
villages.
   ``The sewage system in the north is so old and has been leaking
in several parts,'' said a hospital spokesman, who spoke on

   The Health Ministry in Beirut sent a team to Tripoli to follow
up the cases. At least eight people died of cholera in north
Lebanon in September. The spread of the disease at that time was
also attributed to leaking sewage.

<TEXT>
   Two opinion polls published today indicate the
general public prefers Michael Heseltine over Margaret Thatcher,
but the prime minister said that after 11 years in office she is
not intimidated by his challenge.
   Speaking in the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher attacked
Heseltine's proposals for education funding and expressed
confidence that she would win the leadership vote on Tuesday. If
she does, she remains prime minister; if Heseltine does, he takes
over the top job.
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the small Liberal Democratic party,
teased the prime minister by holding up a 5-year-old newspaper
interview headlined: ``Maggie: I'll Go in Five Years.''
   ``What made her change her mind?'' Ashdown asked.
   Mrs. Thatcher said:
   ``I confess that that wasn't the foremost thought in my mind at
this present time. ... After three general election victories,
leading the only party with clear policies, resolutely carried out,
I intend to continue.''
   Heseltine, a former defense secretary, is the first serious
challenger to Mrs. Thatcher since she became Conservative Party
leader in 1975 and prime minister in 1979.
   Zeroing in on Heseltine's proposal that the national government
assume the costs of education, she said that would ``either mean a
huge increase in income tax, or a substantial reduction in monies
available for other services.''
   Two opinion polls published in newspapers today showed that
Heseltine was more popular than Mrs. Thatcher with the general
public.
   However, one poll, published in The Guardian newspaper, showed
that Mrs. Thatcher is still the overwhelming favorite of
Conservative Party voters.
   Heseltine, who submitted his nomination papers to party
officials this morning, argues he is more likely to lead the
Conservatives to victory in the next general election, which must
be held by mid-1992.
   A poll of 1,084 people published in The Independent newspaper
showed the Conservatives trailing Labor by 14 percentage points
with Mrs. Thatcher at the helm. But, when the poll asked how people
would vote if Heseltine were Conservative leader, the gap shrank to
five points.
   The poll, conducted Wednesday by National Opinion Polls, had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percent.
   The Guardian, which polled 1,446 people, found that Heseltine
was favored when respondents of all political stripes were
questioned, but that Mrs. Thatcher came out ahead when only
Conservatives were asked.
   Heseltine was the first choice of 29 percent of the whole
sample, four points ahead of Mrs. Thatcher. Among Conservatives,
however, Mrs. Thatcher was chosen by 59 percent to Heseltine's 18
percent.
   ``The poll underlines the cruel choice facing Tory MPs,'' the
Guardian reported. ``If they vote to keep Mrs. Thatcher, they will
persevere with a leader who among the electorate attracts much the
greater hostility of any contender. If they ditch her, they will
deeply disappoint many committed supporters.''
   The margin of error for the poll, conducted last weekend by
International Communication Marketing Research Ltd., was not
reported.
   A third poll of 240 of the 373 Conservative lawmakers, taken
between Monday and today by Press Association, the British news
agency, found that Heseltine faces defeat Tuesday.
   Press Association forecast that Mrs. Thatcher would win 53.3
percent of the vote and Heseltine would get 19.2 percent. But 27.5
percent of the Members of Parliament questioned refused to reveal
their positions.

<HEAD>Premier Calls for Emergency Measures to Deal With Grain Surplus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng has called for emergency measures
to handle grain overflowing storage spaces after China's record
harvest, an official report said Thursday.
   Li urged ``the mobilization of all social forces,'' and
suggested building new permanent storage facilities, putting up
temporary grain storage tents, and renting warehouses and empty
buildings from other enterprises.
   The official Chinese media have reported for months that
mountains of grain have been left out to rot throughout the
country.
   Official statistics indicate that 30 million to 40 million tons
of grain, representing 7 percent to 9 percent of this year's
harvest, is unsheltered because of a severe shortage of granaries
and other storage space.
   ``At the moment, the lack of granaries is a glaring problem. The
grain departments alone cannot solve this problem,'' a report on
the front page of the People's Daily paraphrased Li as telling
local officials at a national conference on grain production in
Beijing on Wednesday.
   Li also said farmers should be encouraged to find ways of
storing their own grain.
   More than half of China's granaries are over 20 years old. The
government says it plans to build new grain depots capable of
storing 25 million tons of grain over the next five years.
   Already this year, the state has allocated $126 million to build
granaries to store 8 million tons of grain, official reports said.
   Storage is only one problem created by the bumper crop, which is
expected to top 462 million tons. China's largest previous grain
harvest was 407 million tons in 1984.
   Farmers also are confronting low prices, and in some cases no
buyers, for their grain.
   Chinese farmers can sell their harvest on the free market after
meeting a state-set quota. But two consecutive years of bumper
harvests have caused free market grain prices to drop.
   The state has raised its purchasing price for grain, but not
enough to cover the rising costs of fertilizer and other outlays.
   To help make up for the drop in the market price, the state this
fall started buying grain in excess of the quota at a slightly
higher price than it paid for grain due to the state.

   Leaders of the 250,000 high school students who
marched this week for a better education today demanded the
government immediately spend millions of dollars in an emergency
fund on the overcrowded school system.
   Education Minister Lionel Jospin met with a delegation of 20
students representing the two main moderate and leftist
organizations that have emerged in four weeks of protests.
   Delegates said before the talks started that $1 billion that
Premier Michel Rocard earmarked on Wednesday from the 1990 budget
wouldn't be enough.
   Leaders of the moderate Federation Independant des Lyceens said
they would ask for an additional $777 million during the talks.
   Another organization led by the Communist Party's youth movement
also declared a higher sum would be necessary.
   Both groups basically seek more teachers, smaller classes, more
innovative education and better security at schools in tough
neighborhoods where crime and drugs are growing problems.
   A march on Monday by 250,000 students in Paris and the provinces
deteriorated into widespread vandalism in the capital.
   Several hundred members of youth gangs exploited the crowd on
the Left Bank to break windows, loot shops and burn or otherwise
damage 190 cars.
   At least 140 police officers were injured in rock and tear-gas
battles with the rioters. Special courts on Wednesday jailed or
fined 53 youths arrested during the incident.
   Though Jospin and President Francois Mitterrand promised Monday
to take steps to meet student demands, their leaders have vowed to
keep up pressure until concrete measures are approved.
   The students plan to stage what they hope will be a peaceful
sit-in Friday before the National Asssembly. They had earlier
planned a march, but changed their tactics after Monday's rioting.
   The marches and accompanying violence are putting pressure on
Rocard's government, which already faces a no-confidence test next
week over plans to reform social security.
   His quick cash injection, targeted specifically at high schools,
will add an extra $444 million dollars to this year's $20 billion
budget deficit.
   The students won broad public support as accounts emerged of
graffiti-scarred high schools with holes in the roofs, exposed
wires, shortages of desks, violence against teachers and pupils,
extortion, and drug use.
   The marches began last month after a student was raped in a
lavatory in the gritty Paris suburb of St. Ouen. Most of the nearly
daily protests have been peaceful.

   President Bush met today with leaders of some
of the nation's largest corporations and banks as part of a series
of private sessions to help him gauge whether the economy is in a
recession.
   The president is trying to decide what steps he might be able to
take to help soften the impact of the current slowdown, said a
White House official.
   The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
today's meeting follows a meeting on Wednesday between the
president and bank regulators and administration economic
officials.
   John G. Medlin Jr., president and chief executive officer of the
First Wachovia Corp., said that the group of executives gave Bush a
generally gloomy assessment of the economy with many expressing the
belief that the country has either slipped into a recession or is
on the verge of a downturn.
   Medlin said that Bush gave no indications of what the
administration may be proposing in an effort to lessen the severity
of any downturn and spent most of the session listening to what the
business executives had to say in describing economic conditions.
   ``The president just listened. He didn't give us his views,''
Medlin said. ``He was very sincerely looking for views out in the
real world.''
   The White House officials said that Bush likely will hold
another meeting with executives on Friday.
   The White House refused to release a list of those meeting with
Bush, saying the sessions were private. ``It's an opportunity for
the president to hear them (the business leaders). These are
listening sessions,'' the official said.
   The sessions are an outgrowth of a meeting Bush had over the
weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, chief White House economist
Michael Boskin, Budget Director Richard Darman and Vice President
Dan Quayle.
   The president, at a news conference last Thursday, said he was
``concerned about an economic slowdown in the economy.''
   ``I want to be sure that, to the degree a president can do
something to soften the blow or to stimulate economic growth, that
he tries to do it,'' Bush said at the time.
   White House officials today referred to those news conference
remarks when asked about the series of meetings.
   Today's session is ``one of a series of private meetings the
president is having to discuss the status of the economy with
inside and outside experts,'' the White House official said.
   ``He likes to keep in touch,'' the official added.
   Although administration officials have not used the word
``recession'' to describe the current slowdown, many private
economists have suggested that the economy may already be in a
recession - or at least teetering on the edge of one.
   And Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, has offered far gloomier assessments of economy's
condition in private meetings than in his public appearances,
administration sources said.

   Four protesters were charged with misdemeanor
trespassing after being caught on the Nevada Test Site minutes
before a British nuclear weapon was to be detonated deep beneath
the desert floor.
   The four were released on their own recognizance after an
appearance Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt.
   Scientists detonated the nuclear after a delay of more than two
hours, which government officials attributed both to technical
problems and the search for the infiltrators near ground zero.
   The device, with an explosive punch up to 12 times the force of
the World War II atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was detonated at
11:17 a.m. Wednesday after the four were removed by security
officers.
   ``We're very pleased with the success of the protest,'' said
Junior Bridge, a spokeswoman for the Greenpeace environmental
organization.
   It was the second time in three years that anti-nuclear
activists have infiltrated the sprawling secret desert site to
delay a nuclear test.
   Motion from the blast was felt at Las Vegas City Hall, about 105
miles away, and atop the city's highrise hotels. It measured 5.1 on
the Richter scale at the National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo.
   Energy Department officials rejected Greenpeace claims that the
four protesters were near ground zero until they popped into view
of cameras monitoring the blast site during a technical hold in the
countdown six minutes before detonation.
   The nuclear device was buried 1,900 feet deep in a shaft filled
with concrete.
   DOE spokesman Jim Boyer said intruders could be nearly on ground
zero and the blast would ``just shake them up a lot.'' But Energy
Department spokesman Chris West has said that someone standing on
ground zero could receive a jolt from the blast strong enough to
break their legs.
   All British nuclear tests are conducted in Nevada under a mutual
defense treaty with the United States.
   Wednesday's test was the eighth this year at the Nevada site and
the 707th since testing began there in 1951. The last previous test
was Oct. 12.

   Increased forest fires, less snow, warmer
lakes and fewer trout in Ontario may give a glimpse of what will
happen if the Earth warms as a result of the greenhouse effect,
Canadian researchers say.
   Scientists at the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans
report Friday in the journal Science that lakes monitored for more
than 20 years in northwestern Ontario have been slowly changing as
temperatures rise, snowfall declines and fires ravage nearby
forests.
   D. W. Schindler, leader of the group, said the study does not
claim that the changes are due to the greenhouse effect, but that
the changes could be a preview of what is to come if the Earth does
warm up.
   ``This is by no means the only period that has warmed for a
prolonged time or at the rate that we're seeing,'' said Schindler.
``Our point is...to show what increasing warming and drying, which
we would see with a greenhouse effect, would do to lakes and their
watersheds.''
   The greenhouse effect refers to global warming that is caused
when the atmosphere is enriched with carbon dioxide and some other
manmade gases that affect the movement of solar radiation and heat.
The so-called greenhouse gases allow sunlight to pass through the
atmosphere and strike the Earth. But the gases can prevent heat
from radiating back out into space, thus trapping thermal energy
about the planet.
   An increase in carbon dioxide is related to the burning of
fossil fuels, such as coal and oil.
   The Canadian study shows that snowfall and other precipitation
has decreased since the mid-1970s in the lakes in the Ontario study
area. As a result, water runoff into the lakes has declined and
this, in turn, has affected the lake chemistry. The waters have
become clearer.
   Drier weather has led to more forest fires, some burning over
millions of acres in the watershed feeding the lakes. This also
changed the chemistry of the lakes and caused an increase in
evaporation by allowing winds to more directly blow on the lakes.
   Schindler said air and water temperatures have increased, on the
average, about 3.6 degrees during the study period.
   Snow, which once blanketed the area from fall to spring, now is
sparse, with midwinter melts occurring most years.
   The lakes also lose their ice cover about 20 days earlier in the
spring, said Schindler. This allows the lakes to absorb more solar
radiation in the spring and thus warm up sooner and reach a higher
temperature.
   Plant life has increased and changed in the lakes, due to the
clearer water and warmer temperatures. This could provide more food
for some fish and small organisms, but the warmer water may also
cause major shifts in the types of fish, said Schindler.
   ``We may have increased productivity from the lakes, but there
may be some pretty dramatic species changes,'' he said. ``What may
be good trout lakes now may become good bass lakes. But we would
have to stock them because the bass would not invade naturally.''
   Schindler emphasized that his group is only reporting the
observed effects of temperature and precipitation changes, not
guessing on what is causing it.
   ``I'm not going to speculate if this is due to increases in
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, or if it is a natural
phenomenon at this point,'' he said.
   But Schindler said that the study does show that the changes
brought about by the greenhouse effect will be many, varied and not
altogether predictable.
   ``Our record indicates that it will not be a simplistic
response,'' he said.
   Schindler was on the staff of the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans when the study was conducted, but is now a researcher at the
University of Alberta in Edmonton.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Earth's beauty, and environmental threats to
its survival, are vividly displayed in ``Blue Planet,'' a $5
million giant-screen movie filmed by astronauts aboard seven space
shuttle flights.
   The 42-minute film is opening this month at IMAX and OMNIMAX
theaters in 14 U.S. and Canadian cities. It will be shown in at
least 11 other cities during the next four months before being
shown internationally next spring.
   ``We hope the audience will come out of the film feeling
concerned about protecting the Earth. It's our only home,'' said
Graeme Ferguson, producer of ``Blue Planet'' and co-founder of IMAX
Systems Corp. of Toronto.
   The movie gives viewers ``a real good feel for the perspective
shuttle crew members have from low Earth orbit,'' said astronaut
James Buchli, 45, a Marine colonel who helped shoot the film during
Discovery's March 1989 mission.
   ``It's hard not to appreciate the grandeur of our Earth from
that perch,'' Buchli said by phone from Johnson Space Center in
Texas. ``You have a powerful feling of how insignificant each of
us is with respect to the world as a whole.''
   The camera used to make ``Blue Planet'' was invented in 1967.
IMAX film has a frame size 10 times larger than conventional 35mm
movie film, providing intense detail and a wide-field view that can
be projected onto a giant screen.
   ``Blue Planet'' depicts the natural and human forces that shape
Earth's environment, using IMAX and still photography from space
and a variety of film shot on the planet's surface and beneath the
sea.
   From space, the movie shows peaceful, almost alien scenes of
volcanoes, eerie lightning flashes, puffy thunderclouds and giant
swirling hurricanes. Then the film moves to the ground, capturing
the violence of those natural processes with help from a powerful
sound system.
   The movie was directed by four-time Oscar-winning sound designer
Ben Burtt, who did sound effects for the ``Stars Wars'' trilogy and
``Indiana Jones'' films.
   The main message of ``Blue Planet'' deals with human damage to
the environment: topsoil from farms washing down the Mississippi
and Yangtze rivers, destruction of Madagascar forests, vast
stretches of city lights gobbling energy, and a pall of smoke
obscuring the Amazon Basin as rain forest goes up in flames.
   The space scenes in ``Blue Planet'' were shot during seven
shuttle flights between 1984 and April.
   Ferguson, 61, also produced ``The Dream is Alive,'' the 1985
film that has been seen by more than 25 million people worldwide
and was the first to use IMAX cameras aboard shuttles. He
co-produced ``Hail Columbia!'' the 1982 IMAX film about the first
shuttle mission. An IMAX camera wasn't aboard that flight.
   Lockheed Corp. paid most of the $5 million cost of ``Blue
Planet.'' Other sponsors were the Smithsonian Institution's
National Air and Space Museum, IMAX Systems and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Ferguson said the next IMAX film is a bit less cosmic: a
90-minute feature on the Rolling Stones' concert tour.

<HEAD>Administration Takes New Aim At Public Power Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is preparing a plan to
cut public power subsidies but expects strong opposition from
beneficiaries of the low-cost energy, lawmakers say.
   The proposals explore selling public power to the highest
bidder, as well as including a surcharge to bring prices up to
market levels in areas where the subsidized power is sold below
cost.
   ``Auctioning off federal power at market rates is a radical,
radical notion,'' said Paul Reiten, an energy expert for Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore. ``For instance, Southern California could come in
and outbid the Northwest ... and leave the Northwest with a power
shortage.''
   The Office of Budget and Management, offering suggestions for
President Bush's new National Energy Strategy, outlined the
money-saving options last week in recommendations to the Energy
Department.
   OMB and DOE officials declined comment on the plan, but the
American Public Power Association provided a copy of the memo to
The Associated Press. It was confirmed by aides to Hatfield.
   ``This proposal eliminates multibillion dollar energy
consumption subsidies at a time when DOE is expanding energy
conservation subsidies,'' the OMB memo said.
   The agency acknowledged the plan would ``not be accepted by
interest groups receiving the subsidies. The beneficiaries have a
well-organized and strong nationwide constituency and are
represented by powerful lobbying organizations.''
   Presidents Reagan and Bush previously have recommended saving
money by raising interest rates or speeding up debt payments for
the nation's five public power marketing administrations.
   The biggest, the Bonneville Power Administration, provides about
half the Pacific Northwest's power, serving about 8 million
consumers.
   Hatfield said he believes the plan would boost wholesale public
power rates in his region by more than 30 percent and residential
rates by nearly 20 percent.
   ``This isn't a budget deficit measure, this is a proposal for
social and economic disaster in the Pacific Northwest,'' Hatfield
said.
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., a member of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, said any federal gains through reduced
subsidies would be more than offset by shortfalls in tax receipts
as a result of the economic impact on the Northwest.
   ``It is a shortsighted, stupid, monomania idea in the mind of
some troll in OMB,'' Swift said.
   The OMB memo said the power administrations ``provide subsidies
for the well-to-do at the expense of the taxpayers in cities and
poorer areas of the country.'' The below-cost sales have cost the
federal treasury $4 billion since the dams were built, the agency
said.
   BPA has the greatest installed generating capacity among the
five administrations, 22,900 megawatts.
   But the plan also would address Western Area Power
Administration, 10,400 megawatts; Southeastern Power
Administration, 3,090 megawatts; Southwestern Power Administration,
2,150 megawatts; Alaska Power Administration, 108 megawatts.
   It takes about 1,000 megawatts to meet the energy needs of a
city the size of Seattle.

<HEAD>Poll Says Two-Thirds Feel Health Care System Not Working Well</HEAD>

   Most Americans are disillusioned with the
current health care system and favor rationing, although no one
strategy has majority support, according to a survey released
Thursday.
   The poll, conducted for Northwestern Life Insurance Company,
found just 30 percent of those surveyed agreed that the country's
health care system is working well, while 67 percent disagreed.
   More than 9 in 10 agreed that health care costs - expected to
reach $650 billion for the nation this year - are rising out of
control and that the country's health care system needs major
changes to control costs.
   While more than two-thirds of those surveyed said they were
confident their health care costs would be taken care of if they
became seriously ill today, 60 percent worried that would not be
the case in the future.
   Ninety-four percent said health care should be available to
everyone regardless of ability to pay, but 52 percent said people
who can pay should be able to buy extra care if they want it.
   Michael Conley, senior vice president for group insurance at the
Minneapolis-based Northwestern Life, said this seeming
contradiction is probably because Americans ``are still forming
their values on rationing.''
   But panelists who spoke after the poll results were presented
said they were surprised that people think rationing is a new
concept. They suggested that people have different interpretations
of what it means.
   ``We really do ration health care now ... by limitations on
access'' to health care, said John Golenski, president of the
Bioethics Consultation Group Inc. of Berkeley, Calif., and an
architect of Oregon's plan to revamp its Medicaid program.
   An estimated 31 million to 37 million Americans are uninsured.
   The survey focused on beliefs about rationing in general and did
not ask more broadly what kind of changes in the current system
people would like to see.
   The poll found that 85 percent agreed with at least one of six
rationing concepts presented, but a majority could not agree on any
one strategy.
   The strongest support, 44 percent, was for idea that treatments
or procedures that are rationed or denied should be denied to
everyone, regardless of ability to pay.
   Forty percent said availability of publicly funded health care
should be based on the chance of success of the treatment, and 29
percent said smokers should be denied public funds for health care
for treatment of illness caused by smoking.
   More than a quarter said children should be given priority for
services and 16 percent said rationing should apply only to those
using public funds.
   Also, half said they would trust a panel of medical
professionals to make rationing decisions.
   The poll, conducted by Project Research Inc. of Minneapolis,
involved telephone interviews with 500 adults in August and
September. The margin of error was 4.5 percent, officials said.

   Thrift regulators are demanding a record $6.8
billion from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for alleged junk bond
fraud. The collapsed investment firm says it's being made a
scapegoat for the savings and loan debacle.
   The claims filed in federal Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday accuse
Drexel and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, of
``plundering'' more than 40 failed thrifts through racketeering,
fraud, bribery and numerous other crimes.
   The allegations brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp. are by far the largest damages
sought in the S&amp;L crisis, which is expected to cost taxpayers more
than $500 billion over 30 years.
   They also, for the first time, pin much of the blame for the
crisis on Drexel.
   The 60-page court filing, released today, claims Drexel starting
in 1982 ``spread a gospel of greed'' and illegally made billions of
dollars by inducing S&amp;Ls to use their federally insured deposits to
buy junk bonds.
   ``The exposure of Drexel's and Milken's criminality destroyed
the illusions surrounding junk bonds that Drexel and Milken had
sought to create,'' the filing said.
   The agencies charged Drexel manipulated junk bond prices,
arranged secret securities ``parking'' deals, ran sham
transactions, bribed favored customers and controlled a network of
S&amp;L customers to sustain a fictitious market.
   The filing lists 41 failed thrifts with junk bond losses
totaling more than $330 million and seeks $1.25 million more in
damages for the lost value of current holdings. An additional 18
failed thrifts have separate non-junk bond claims. Institutions
from 18 states and the District of Columbia are included.
   The alleged damages sought are tripled under federal antitrust
and racketeering laws, for a total of $6 billion. The agencies also
seek $800 million for the alleged illegal activity unrelated to
junk bonds.
   A separate claim for more than $4.5 billion was filed on behalf
of Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Los Angeles, which has
not been taken over by the government.
   The largest claimed loss is $56.2 million by Imperial Savings
Association of San Diego and the smallest $27,500 by Charter
Savings Bank of Newport Beach, Calif. The filing seeks $150 million
for alleged securities fraud by Drexel against Capital Bank &amp; Trust
Co. of Washington, D.C.
   FDIC and RTC chairman L. William Seidman said the agencies
``still have much more to do to ensure that we identify and recover
all the losses caused by Drexel. The American taxpayers ... expect
no less from us.''
   Drexel said in a statement that it ``has become a convenient
scapegoat for the S&amp;L crisis as various agencies and branches of
the government attempt to deflect their own responsibility.''
   ``Regardless of the number of zeros in the claims ... Drexel
intends to vigorously defend against them,'' the firm said. ``In
court the conduct of regulators and others chiefly responsible for
the S&amp;L debacle will be the real issue.''
   Drexel, which sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
February, already faces billions of dollars more in claims in more
than 100 lawsuits filed by investors, shareholders and former
clients.
   Milken has pleaded guilty to securities violations and is
awaiting sentencing next week.
   The FDIC insures deposits for the nation's savings and loans.
Resolution Trust oversees the thrift bailout and has taken over
more than 100 failed S&amp;Ls.
   Drexel handled most of the $15 billion in junk bonds bought by
thrifts. But the junk bond market collapsed about a year ago,
devastating the securities' value.
   The claims are far larger than a $1.1 billion racketeering
lawsuit filed by the government against Lincoln Savings and Loan
head Charles Keating and others.
   But the FDIC and Resolution Trust are not expected to get
anything near $6.8 billion.
   Lawyers for Drexel and those who have sued the company are
negotiating a fixed amount to be set aside to settle more than 100
lawsuits and the federal claims.
   In addition, Drexel's assets, not counting the value of its junk
bond portfolio and certain stock investments, total only about $3
billion, against $2.85 billion in liabilities.
   Drexel and Milken have denied any role in the S&amp;L collapse, and
a March 1989 report by the congressional General Accounting Office
concluded that junk bonds had not contributed to the S&amp;L crisis.
   But the S&amp;L industry was criticized for dealing in junk bonds,
which offer high yields at high risk. Under last year's federal
thrift bailout bill, savings and loans must sell their junk bond
holdings by 1994.
   The FDIC and RTC alleged among other things that Drexel made
misrepresentations about the bonds and gave payoffs to managers of
some S&amp;Ls.
   Drexel also allegedly engaged in anticompetitive practices and
threatened companies that did not retain Drexel as an investment
banker.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A woman found guilty of murdering a
former boyfriend by spoon-feeding him food laced with arsenic
``just loves people'' and shouldn't be put to death, her daughter
told a jury today.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, was convicted Wednesday in the death
of Raymond Reid in 1986.
   As Mrs. Moore's sentencing hearing got under way this morning,
Vanessa Woods said her mother cared for Ms. Woods' premature baby
when it was born several years ago ``like its mother.''
   ``My mother is just the same today as she always is,'' she said.
``She just loves people.''
   Mrs. Moore also is charged with murder in the poisoning of her
first husband in 1973 and with assault for allegedly poisoning her
current husband after their honeymoon last year. No trial dates
have been set in those cases.
   Another character witness at the hearing, jailer Carolyn
Hinshaw, told jurors today that she and Mrs. Moore get down on her
knees every morning and evening and pray during in the 1{ years
Mrs. Moore has been in jail.
   ``All I knew about her is what I read in the paper,'' Mrs.
Hinshaw said. ``She wasn't there very long before her concerns for
other people became very evident.''
   The only options before the jury were life in prison or death,
which is carried out by injection or gas in North Carolina.
   The only woman executed in the United States in the last 15
years was also a North Carolina woman convicted of fatally
poisoning a boyfriend with arsenic. Velma Barfield was put to death
in 1984.
   The jury convicted Mrs. Moore on Wednesday after six hours of
deliberations over two days.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Moore killed Reid to gain part of his
estate, feeding him spiked, home-cooked food while he lay dying
from arsenic poisoning in the hospital. His symptoms had been
mistakenly diagnosed as a rare nerve and muscle disease.
   Mrs. Moore testified last week that she is lovingly cared for
the three men she is accused of poisoning.
   ``I know arsenic was found in these three people, but I know
that I didn't do it,'' she said. ``I've never physically harmed
other people.''
   Mrs. Moore's estranged husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore, who was
hospitalized for arsenic poisoning last year, told a newspaper
Wednesday that he was against execution. ``I would be more at peace
with a life sentence than the death penalty,'' Moore told the
Roanoke (Va.) Times &amp; World-News.
   Moore, who is living on disability and had to resign from his
position at the Carolina United Methodist Church of Christ near
Burlington because of the effects of the poisoning, said he had
been confident that Mrs. Moore would be found guilty.
   ``I felt the jury could have made the decision walking down the
hall to the jury room,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys tried to blame an acquaintance of Mrs.
Moore's, Garvin Thomas, who is now dead.
   They produced a rambling, five-page letter in which he allegedly
confessed to the crimes, but handwriting experts differed on
whether Mrs. Moore or Thomas could have written the letter.
   Officials exhumed five bodies while investigating the case,
including those of Mrs. Moore's father, a former mother-in-law of
hers and a former co-worker.
   They found arsenic in the remains of Mrs. Moore's father, but
she was not charged in his death.

   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' last week had its
largest audience in more than four years and won the ratings race
for network morning shows for the 45th consecutive week.
   A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates on Thursday showed ABC's program won
easily over NBC's ``Today,'' averaging a 5.2 rating to a 3.5. ``CBS
This Morning'' had a 2.6 rating. Each ratings point represents
931,000 homes.
   Ratings were up for ``Good Morning'' and ``Today.'' NBC's
once-dominant show fell behind ``Good Morning'' in January after
the much-publicized replacement of co-anchor Jane Pauley by Deborah
Norville.
   Last week's ratings for ``Good Morning America'' were the show's
highest since the week that ended April 21, 1986, ABC said. The
show also had a 5.2 rating then, but a ratings point at that time
represented 859,000 homes.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Grow Amid Concern About Further Production
Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories grew 0.5 percent in
September, the government said Thursday, leading some analysts to
express concern the buildup could lead to further production cuts
and loss of jobs.
   Economist Evelina Tainer of the First National Bank of Chicago
noted that industrial production in October already dropped 0.8
percent, its sharpest cutback in nine months.
   ``It's consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into
a recession and growth will be negative in the fourth quarter,''
she said.
   Analysts said the inventory level itself had not reached a
dangerous level although continued vigilance was needed to prevent
an even deeper reduction in output.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots in September totaled a seasonally adjusted $811.5 billion,
up from $807.5 billion the previous month.
   But the accumulation slowed from a 0.7 percent gain in both July
and August, the largest increases since an 0.8 percent advance in
July 1989.
   Business sales dipped 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$548.7 billion, down from $551.5 billion a month earlier.
   It was the first decline in sales since a 0.4 percent drop in
July and the largest since a 1.0 percent decrease last April.
August sales had jumped 2.1 percent.
   The ratio of inventories to sales edged up to 1.48 from a 1.46
level in August. The ratio means it would take 1.48 months to
exhaust the backlog of goods at the September sales pace.
   Still, the ratio was down from its recent peak of 1.54 in July
1989 and economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New
York said businesses are now able to react more rapidly to economic
developments and avoid serious buildups.
   The ratio reached a high of 1.74 in January 1982 during the last
recession.
   ``I think you'll see inventories coming down, but coming down
coincident with a slowdown in sales,'' Niemira said, noting that
retail purchases last month slowed to a 0.1 percent increase from a
1.3 percent advance in September.
   In both months, however, the sales gains were fueled by high
gasoline prices, rather than volume. When the gasoline component
was excluded, retail sales actually fell 0.1 percent last month
while rising just 0.9 percent in September.
   All categories posted inventory gains - manufacturers, up 0.6
percent, and wholesalers and retailers, up 0.4 percent each.
   At the same time, manufacturers' sales fell 0.7 percent while
wholesalers posted a 1.8 percent decline. Sales at the retail level
jumped 1.3 percent.

<HEAD>Cuban Exile Sentenced in Death of Former Chilean Diplomat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban-born man who pleaded guilty to
conspiracy in the 1976 assassination of former Chilean Ambassador
Orlando Letelier was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. called the deaths of
Letelier and an aide, Ronni Moffitt, a ``cold, ruthless act of
terrorism'' before sentencing Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel to the
maximum prison term allowed under a plea agreement.
   Suarez, a member of the Cuban National Movement, was described
by his attorney as an anti-Castro Cuban.
   ``In all his political zeal, he turned to one of the few
countries in the world'' that could have given him freedom,
Robinson said referring to Suarez's move to the United States. But
``he chose not to be as free'' as everyone else, the judge said.
   Letelier and Moffitt were killed here Sept. 21, 1976, when a
bomb exploded beneath the former ambassador's car. Letelier,
Chile's ambassador to Washington from 1971 to 1973, was an
outspoken critic of the right-wing military government of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Suarez, who had been a fugitive for a dozen years, in September
admitted giving a blasting cap to former Chilean intelligence agent
Michael V. Townley, who allegedly masterminded the assassination.
   In exchange for Suarez's plea, authorities agreed to drop
charges of concealing a fugitive against his wife, Elizabeth
Gongora Suarez, officials said.
   Suarez, 51, will be eligible for parole after serving nine
years.
   Two other people have been convicted in connection with the
bombing. Townley was sentenced to 10 years, while former Chilean
army Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios received seven years.
   Fernandez defected from Chile in 1987 and pleaded guilty to an
accessory after the fact. He implicated two of his superiors and
Pinochet in the coverup of the Chilean military's involvement in
the crime.
   The two Chilean military officials have been charged with
participating in the murder, but the Chilean government has refused
to extradite them.

<HEAD>Social Workers Say Parents Shouldn't Spank Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slapping or spanking children only encourages them
to think violence is an acceptable form of behavior, says a social
workers' group.
   The National Association of Social Workers, which previously
opposed corporal punishment in schools, has passed a resolution
rejecting physical punishment for children in the home.
   Since the policy was passed in August, the Silver Spring,
Md.-based group with 130,000 members has been promoting its
resolution nationwide.
   ``Beating a child, whipping a child, spanking a child is really
not a rational way of teaching a child how to change his or her
behavior,'' said Isadora Hare, staff director of the group's
Commission on Education.
   ``What you do is breed resentment in the child and anger towards
you which is going to come out in more undesirable behavior. What
is important is to teach a child why behavior is unacceptable.''
   The no spanking policy and alternative means of child discipline
is being discussed the group's annual meeting this week in Boston.
   Nineteen states ban corporal punishment in schools, Hare said.
But dissuading parents from hitting their children will be tough in
a country where such discipline is widespread, largely because of
religious beliefs, she said.

   Fred the cockatoo from the Robert Blake TV
series ``Baretta'' was found this morning, a day and a half after
being stolen from the San Diego Wild Animal Park, officials said.
   The missing cockatoo was one of three that portrayed Blake's pet
during the 1970s series, in which the actor played a streetwise
police officer.
   Police spokesman Bill Robinson said that Scott Forester and
Johnny Martinez told police they spotted the bird in the middle of
a road this morning, less than a mile from the Wild Animal Park.
   Forester and Marintez returned the bird, which appeared
unscathed, to the park.
   The winner of a Patsy - the animal equivalent of an Academy
Award - Fred had been performing in shows at the park for the last
six years.
   The 30-year-old bird was taken from a holding cage kept in the
rear area of the park's bird show theater sometime between Tuesday
evening and Wednesday morning, when the theft was discovered,
Robinson said.
   Park spokesman Tom Hanscom said Fred was the only bird taken
among 40 in the holding cages.
   The cockatoo is owned by Ray Berwick and Associates of Westlake
Village, which contracts with the Wild Animal Park to provide
trained animals for the park's show. The company provided the
cockatoos for the ``Baretta'' series and brought Fred to the Wild
Animal Park, an affiliate of the San Diego Zoo, in 1984, Hanscom
said.
   Because of Fred's training and star status, the bird had an
estimated value of $15,000. Typically, sulfur crested cockatoos can
be obtained for about $2,000.
   Hanscom said Fred can talk in simple phrases, coughs, and
laughs.

   Here are lists of savings and loans the
government regulators allege were defrauded by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   The lists consist of 41 failed thrifts with junk bond losses, 18
failed thrifts with other claims against Drexel and a separate
claim on behalf of Columbia Savings and Loan Association, which has
not been taken over by the government.
   The claims were filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Resolution Trust Corp. in U.S. Bankruptcy Court late Wednesday
and released publicly Thursday.
   For the junk bond losses, the list contains the thrift name,
location, size of losses and total current junk bond holdings at
cost. The additional claims list the alleged wrongdoing and amount
of claim.
   The list does not reflect the total $6.8 billion being sought
against Drexel. That includes the cost of junk bonds still held by
the S&amp;Ls, damages for defaulted bonds, insurance damages to be paid
to S&amp;Ls, tripled damages under federal racketeering and antitrust
laws, and other claims.
   The agencies noted that the data on some of the thrifts may be
incomplete because of difficulty obtaining complete records.

<TEXT>
   President Bush invoked emergency powers
Thursday authorizing the Pentagon to undertake military
construction projects in the Persian Gulf without advance approval
from Congress.
   Without the waiver, the Pentagon would have had to go through a
lengthy process of requesting authorization from Congress for each
construction project and then seeking an appropriation from
lawmakers to finance it.
   ``Operational requirements do not permit such an extended
process for construction of much-needed facilities,'' Bush said in
a letter to leaders of the House and Senate.
   Bush said his action will enable Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney ``to undertake military construction projects that he deems
necessary to respond to the threat caused by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.''
   Bush granted the waiver in an executive order under the
authority of the National Emergencies Act.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager identified as a suspect in
the slayings of five Gainesville college students was sentenced
Thursday to 22 months in a prison mental hospital for beating his
elderly grandmother.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, who has a history of mental problems,
also faces an assault charge in Gainesville and a 1988 attempted
rape and burglary case in Indian River County.
   Public Defender J.R. Russo told Circuit Judge Theron Yawn that
he could find no public treatment center willing to accept the
19-year-old University of Florida student. Private psychiatric
hospitals wanted $600 to $1,000 per day to treat him, more than his
family could afford, Russo said.
   Hospitals run by the universities of Florida, Miami and South
Florida refused to accept Humphrey for private commitment,
partially because of his notoriety, Russo said.
   Humphrey was convicted Oct. 10 on a charge of battery on a
person over age 65.
   The judge imposed the maximum prison term and recommended to the
state prison system that Humphrey serve it in the Corrections
Mental Health Institution at Florida State Hospital in
Chattahoochee.
   ``I look at it as a psychiatric care sentence,'' Russo said,
adding that he doesn't think Humphrey will serve any of his time in
a regular prison.
   Humphrey has been labeled a suspect in the slayings of five
students, some of them mutilated, near the University of Florida
campus in Gainesville during the last week in August. But he has
not been charged in those cases.
   He had been jailed in lieu of $1 million bond since the beating
Aug. 30 at his home in Indialantic, two days after the last two
bodies were discovered in Gainesville.
   Humphrey's grandmother, Elna Hlavaty told a deputy that night
that her grandson had beaten and choked her. But at the trial, she
testified she had fallen and hurt herself in the dark.
   Russo had argued for probation with temporary commitment to a
mental hospital, but the judge said he wanted a sentence somewhere
between probation and prison.
   Humphrey's family reacted angrily to the sentence, with his
79-year-old grandmother calling it a ``charade of justice.''
   ``It should have been thrown out. I was never beaten,'' she
said. ``That boy has done nothing wrong.''
   ``Any hope Ed had of being a normal person has been washed
away,'' said Humphrey's 22-year-old brother, George, choking back
tears.
   ``It's sad to see Ed sacrificed,'' George Humphrey said.
   Edward Humphrey nodded when his grandmother blew him a kiss as
he entered the courtroom but generally appeared oblivious to the
proceedings and mostly stared off into space.
   The judge also placed Humphrey on probation for 14 months after
his prison term with the condition that he continue psychiatric
treatment if needed.
   Humphrey was to transferred to an Orlando hospital for a
psychiatric evaluation and then to the state prison system's mental
health hospital within the next three days, Russo said.

   Singer Michael Jackson is negotiating a new
contract with CBS Records that would beat anything else out there.
   Jackson sent attorney Bertram Fields to New York this week to
team up with his contract negotiator, Allen Grubman. The pop singer
is asking CBS for a special production deal and royalties of more
than $2.50 per album.
   Jackson requested an advance against royalties of more than $18
million per album. Pop music royalties generally range from $1 to
$1.50 per album, including publishing royalties.
   Jackson also is seeking his own recording label, the Los Angeles
Times reported Thursday.
   The newspaper said Jackson wants a guarantee that his deal
outpaces that of any other pop singer, including his sister, Janet
Jackson, who is renegotiating a contract with A&amp;M Records.
   CBS Records spokesman Bob Altshuler declined comment on the
negotiations.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country singer Roseanne Cash says
Americans suffer from a ``cultural malaise'' that values money over
artistic creativity.
   ``We are becoming so heavily identified with that dollars and
cents mentality that we are numbing ourselves to the better half of
our nature,'' Cash told a national panel evaluating music education
in schools.
   She was one of 17 music professionals, educators and students
who addressed the panel from the National Commission on Music
Education.
   The panel will forward its recommendations about music education
to Congress and President Bush next year.

   PARIS (AP) - Actress Debra Winger couldn't shake the desert
after filming ``The Sheltering Sky'' in the Sahara. She put on a
pack and traveled for three weeks in the west-central African
country of Niger.
   ``Only then could I face coming home. I had the desert inside of
me,'' she said Wednesday at a screening of the movie, due to open
in the United States in December.
   Based on Paul Bowles' best-selling novel by the same name, the
film stars Winger and John Malkovich as Kit and Port Moresby,
sophisticated New York artists who go into the African desert to
save their failing marriage.
   Director Bernardo Bertolucci admits his cast and crew went
through an ordeal to make the film. He said the cast and crew of
120 battled desert heat and flooding caused by the first rain in
the region in two years.
   The storms swept away roads and bridges, stranding equipment
trucks, the cast, crew and even Bertolucci himself.
   ``It was a hard movie to make. The sweat isn't makeup, it's real
sweat,'' he said. ``The dust is real dust and the flies are real
flies.''
   Bertolucci aid he was attracted to ``The Sheltering Sky,''
which became something of a cult book when published in 1949,
because ``after `The Last Emperor,' I was really interested in
doing something that didn't have a lot of actors and a lot of
costumes.''

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Sound problems plagued a Billy Joel concert,
and the arena gave refunds to people who complained.
   The $23.50 ticket price was returned to 142 people who
complained during Joel's show at the Target Center, which opened
last month.
   Sound technicians checked into the complaints, found a couple of
dead spots, and corrected the problems, said Frank Russo, center
executive director.
   Some concertgoers in the affected sections were relocated to
unsold seats or private suites at Tuesday's performance, said Nancy
Bindas, director of marketing for the center.

   LANSING, Mich. (AP) - The law caught up to fugitive rocker Bob
Baldori in Toronto, but his lawer says the arrest was cordial with
officers asking for autographs and serenading him with his 1967
hit, ``Who Do You Love?''
   The FBI said the 47-year-old musician was arrested Wednesday by
immigration authorities and was expected to be sent back to
Michigan this weekend.
   Baldori, known as ``Boogie Bob,'' has been a federal fugitive
since February when he disappeared before his arraignment on drug
charges. Authorities seized 88 pounds of marijuana Jan. 16 from his
home near Lansing.
   His lawyer, Mark Fox, said Baldori and his girlfriend were
returning to their Toronto apartment when they were met by police
and immigration officials.
   ``There were about eight officers and most of them wanted his
autograph. Then they sang to him. They broke into `Who Do You
Love?''' he said.
   The song is a Bo Diddly classic. In 1967, Baldori and a band
called The Woolies recorded the song, which made the charts and was
the group's only hit.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) - Argentine writer Adolfo Bioy Casares on
Thursday was awarded the 15th Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered
the Nobel prize of literature in Spanish.
   ``I am overwhelmed with happiness and a bit flustered,'' the
76-year-old Bioy Casares said after the announcement. ``Literature
has been the most important part of my life.''
   He was in Madrid for a seminar on his work. The prize, with a
$129,000 award, is given by the Spanish Culture Ministry.
   Bioy Casares first won acclaim for his 1940 novel ``The
Invention of Morel,'' which formed the basis for Alain
Robbe-Grillet's 1961 film ``Last Year at Marienbad.''
   Also in the 1940s, he used the pseudonym Honorio Bustos Domecq
to publish two collections of short stories with fellow Argentine
Jorge Luis Borges, who later received the Cervantes prize.
   The first, ``Anthology of Fantastic Literature,'' was a
compilation of what later became known as magic realism.

<HEAD>Changes in Eastern Europe Seen Driving Down World Food, Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe
will drive down prices for food and energy worldwide, members of an
international panel of experts predicted Thursday.
   Increased grain production will mean the end of the common farm
policy that has helped keep prices high in the 12 western
governments of the European Community and elsewhere, said L. Alan
Winters of the University of Birmingham in Britain.
   The panel's report foresaw that the biggest food price effect
from the end of the Communist system would come in grain and dairy
products, because of the increased production expected. A 20
percent rise in eastern European milk production would be
equivalent to the same increase in the 12 European Community
countries, it said.
   ``Worldwide price reductions of at least 10 percent (for) wheat
and 9 percent (for) coarse grains would be necessary to absorb the
additional output,'' the panel added.
   Coarse grains are normally fed to farm animals.
   The Soviet Union produces large quantities of oil and coal;
Poland is also a big coal producer. Winters saw world supplies
increasing as eastern European factories become more efficient and
use less energy, and as new drilling methods increase Soviet oil
production.
   ``World oil prices could tumble, perhaps by as much as
one-fifth, squeezing high-cost producers such as (Britain), Mexico
and Texas and reducing OPEC's market power,'' the report said.
   OPEC is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   `Similarly, increases in East European output of coal and gas
will put downward pressure on world prices, even allowing for some
output reductions for environmental reasons, such as in East
Germany,'' it added.
   Members of the panel came from Britain, Switzerland, Italy,
Sweden, Norway and Belgium. It was organized by the Centre for
Economic Policy Research in London.
   The center is a network based on European universities. Its
report, the first of an annual series, was titled ``Monitoring
European Integration - The Impact of Eastern Europe.''
   Portes aid it was presented last week to authorities of the
European Community. He presented it to reporters Thursday under the
auspices of the Brookings Institution, a major private research
group.

   Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, saluted American
troops on Wednesday for defending freedom just as the Pilgrims did
in 1620.
   In a Thanksgiving message released eight days early, he said the
Americans defending Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert Shield have
shown the same courage as the Pilgrims who celebrated the first
Thanksgiving. The operation, he said, has become ``a symbol of
freedom around the world.''
   Here is the text of Schwarzkopf's message:
   ``In 1620 a group of courageous and determined men and women
traveled halfway around the world to restore their freedoms and
return to peaceful, just lives. Three hundred seventy years later,
another group of courageous Americans has again traveled halfway
around the world to the Arabian Gulf region to defend those same
eternal principles.
   ``As we take a brief respite from our important mission in order
to celebrate a harvest of blessings, I want all of you to know that
you have the country's deepest gratitude for the superb job you are
doing making Desert Shield a symbol of freedom around the world.
   ``For those of you deployed away from home, this will not be a
traditional Thanksgiving; but for everyone it will certainly be a
meaningful one, as each of you does your part to defend the ideals
that Americans have held so dear for generations. I salute and
thank everyone associated with Desert Shield for giving so much to
the country.''

<BYLINE>Post-Communist Army Trimmed Dramatically, To Become Defensive Force
^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's post-Communist army has been
trimmed by 100,000 soldiers and will be nearly halved to transform
it into the defensive force of a neutral country, the Defense
Ministry announced Thursday.
   Meanwhile, troops are being reoriented to defend the eastern
border with the Soviet Union as well as the western frontier as
they had before, officials said at a news conference.
   Military officials of the old regime are being replaced, with 62
percent of the Defense Ministry administration changed since
Solidarity took over the government last year, the officials said.
   They said any military role of the Warsaw Pact already has been
``frozen.''
   ``We hope that military power will never again be the weightiest
argument in European or world politics,'' said Vice Adm. Piotr
Kolodziejczyk, the defense minister who in July replaced the
longtime Communist defense chief, Gen. Florian Siwicki.
   Poland always maintained the largest army in the Warsaw Pact
after the Soviet Union.
   Now it will undergo a thorough transformation as it shifts to a
defensive orientation and sheds its political role, Kolodziejczyk
told reporters at his first news conference as defense minister.
   Troops will number 305,000 by the end of December, down from
more than 400,000 in 1988, he said.
   Planners have started intensive work on a new military model,
dubbed ``Armed Forces '90,'' that envisions an army of 230,000 to
250,000 highly mobile, well-trained, well-armed troops.
   Poland's defense will no longer be focused only on its western
border, the officials said. However, permanent redeployment of
divisions to the eastern border is too expensive now, although it
will be considered if budgets allow in the future.
   Kolodziejczyk said it would take no more than a day to move
troops to eastern Poland, adding ``despite the absence of people in
uniform in those regions, we care about assuring security and
people should be assured.''
   He rejected claims from candidates in Poland's Nov. 25
presidential election that democratic change has been too slow in
the military. He said 56 generals will have left by Jan. 1, when
there will be a total of 88, compared with 188 in 1984 and 96 in
Poland's last independent army on the eve of World War II in 1939.
   Deputy Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a civilian formerly
known as the spokesman for the long-banned Solidarity movement,
predicted that two military groups will exist after the demise of
the Warsaw Pact: NATO and the Soviet Union - or at least the
Russian republic.
   Poland will be a ``neutral'' country, not aligned with either,
he said.
   ``Poland will remain neutral in the sense that ... it does not
plan in the future to join NATO or to get into some kind of
military alliance with the Soviet Union which would make it
impossible for Poland to keep close to both the West and the
East,'' he said.
   Onyszkiewicz said the Warsaw Pact's military role has
essentially ended.
   ``At the moment, these institutions do not function. They are
completely frozen, and our armed forces are under absolute control
of the Polish command and the Polish political authorities,'' he
said.
   Poland sees the Warsaw Pact having a brief second life as a
consultative body. ``We think it is something relatively
short-termed, and this pact is of a transitional character, but we
think it can fill a certain political void which otherwise would be
created in Central Europe,'' Onyszkiewicz said.

   Barbara Bush, accompanying the president on an
eight-day trip to Europe and the Persian Gulf, will introduce
Czechoslovakian children to a book she ghost-wrote for the family
dog, Millie.
   Mrs. Bush will read to students at the Prague Middle School from
``Millie's Book.'' The book is a tongue-in-cheek insider's view of
life in the White House as seen trough a dog's eyes.
   Mrs. Bush's schedule in Paris, Prague, Germany, Cairo and Saudi
Arabia also includes time with the wives of heads of state and
visits to literary and cultural spots.
   She will get a taste of Saudi Arabian segregation of the sexes,
dining separately with the king's wife while their husbands eat in
another room.
   On the first day of the trip Saturday, Mrs. Bush will join the
wife of Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, Olga, for several
events in Prague.
   In addition to the visit to the middle school, the first ladies
will stop at a hospital for the mentally disabled, and take a
walking tour of the Charles Bridge, a pedestrian bridge with a
famous view.
   The Bushes travel then to Ludwigshafen, Germany, where Mrs. Bush
will have tea on Sunday with the wife of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
while their husbands hold talks.
   In Paris, where Bush will attend the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Mrs. Bush on Monday will join the spouses of
the other leaders participating in the 34-nation conference.
   The spouses will tour the historical Trianon Palace and attend a
luncheon hosted by Daniele Mitterrand, wife of the president.
   On Tuesday they will tour the Picasso exhibit at the Grand
Palais Museum and attend a luncheon hosted by Michele Rocard, wife
of Prime Minister Michel Rocard, and visit the Institute Pasteur
which is conducting AIDS research.
   The president and Mrs. Bush will travel to Saudi Arabia on
Wednesday and will spend Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, with the U.S.
troops sent by Bush to stand against the army of Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein.
   Mrs. Bush will have dinner in Jeddah on Wednesday night with
Princess Jawhara, the most recent of the three wives King Fahd is
known to have had. The president and the king will dine separately
for a working dinner.
   Women in Saudi Arabia are not permitted to take part in affairs
of state.
   The Bushes will stop in Cairo before returning home next Friday.
Mrs. Bush is expected to accompany the wife of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Suzanne, to a library and a school for blind
children.

<HEAD>Researchers: Most Cystic Fibrosis Occurs When Key Protein Misplaced
^Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST, time set by source</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most cystic fibrosis cases occur because cells
single out and block a crucial protein when it is misformed,
suggests a study that boosts prospects for developing treatment.
   Scientists had already linked cystic fibrosis to a malfunction
on the surface of cells. But the finding that the malformed protein
simply never shows up on the surface where it belongs ``was a big
surprise to us,'' said researcher Alan Smith.
   The finding supports the idea that cystic fibrosis may be
treatable by having patients inhale an aerosol to deliver the
protein into its proper place, he said.
   Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects about 30,000
children and young adults in the United States. Their lungs produce
a thick, sticky mucus that sets the stage for fatal lung
infections. Mucus elsewhere interferes with digestion.
   The abnormal mucus appears because cells cannot expel charged
particles called chloride ions, while they absorb other particles
called sodium ions too rapidly.
   That results from defects in the gene that tells cells how to
make a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator, or CFTR. The genetic defects lead to faulty versions of
CFTR.
   The new study suggests that most cases of cystic fibrosis occur
because these versions never reach their proper place on the cell
surface.
   The work is reported in Friday's issue of the journal Cell by
Smith and colleagues at the Genzyme Corp. of Framingham, Mass.
   ``It's a beautiful piece of work'' that ``allowed them to make
an important new hypothesis'' about what causes cystic fibrosis,
commented Dr. Michael Welsh of the University of Iowa College of
Medicine in Iowa City and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
   The work was done in monkey cells, and the hypothesis should now
be tested in cells from cystic fibrosis patients and healthy
people, he said.
   For the research, scientists injected cells in the laboratory
with genetic material that carried specific mutations, some of
which mimicked defects in the CFTR gene that cause cystic fibrosis.
   The mutation responsible for about 70 percent of cystic fibrosis
cases led to a version of CFTR that was incompletely processed by
the cell, scientists found.
   Normally, the cell adds carbohydrates to the backbone of the
CFTR protein. That is a two-step process, but the defective version
of CFTR completed only the first step, Smith said.
   Apparently it was recognized as abnormal by some sort of
``quality control mechanism,'' he said in a telephone interview.
The abnormal protein failed to continue on to take up its normal
position on the surface of the cell, he said.
   Genzyme scientists are studing the possibility of treating
cystic fibrosis by replacing the missing CFTR at the cell surface,
he said. ``This finding very much encourages us,'' he said.
   The idea would be to use a virus or some other targeting system
to deliver normal CFTR to lung cells, he said.
   That strategy had been discussed before, along with others such
as delivering normal CFTR genes to the cells, noted Robert Beall,
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's executive vice president for
medical affairs.
   The new work suggests that protein replacement ``may be a very
important option,'' he said.
   Smith said that the absence of CFTR at the cell surface does not
cause all cases of cystic fibrosis. The study found that two very
rare genetic mutations that cause the disease do not keep CFTR from
getting to the surface, he said.

   More than 100 Americans and their foreign-born

U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways flight, the State Department said
Thursday.
   Most are women and children who have been eligible to leave for
some time but decided only recently to do so, said deputy spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   Iraq has forbidden American men to leave Iraq and Kuwait except
for those with Arab ancestry. More than 100 American men have been
taken to military and industrial installations to deter a possible
U.S. attack on Iraq.
   After leaving Kuwait, the plane is scheduled to stop in Baghdad
before proceeding to London. It was not clear when the Americans
and their family members would arrive in the United States.
   Earlier charter flights have taken more than 2,000 Americans out
of Iraq and Kuwait. According to U.S. estimates, there are fewer
than 1,000 Americans left in the two countries.
   Some Americans, responding to an Iraqi invitation, are making
plans for holiday visits to family members trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait. The State Department is opposed to such travel, saying the
safety of the visiting Americans cannot be assured.

<HEAD>Doctors May Be Wrongly Evaluating Patients' Heart Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors may be giving bad advice about the dangers
of heart disease by not considering the interaction of risk factors
such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking, a doctor
said Thursday.
   ``Based on single factor determinations, they may be needlessly
alarming or falsely reassuring patients,'' said Dr. William B.
Kannel of Boston University.
   Kannel is one of the principal investigators with the Framingham
Heart Study, a 40-year-long study of 5,209 people in Framingham,
Mass., 25 miles west of Boston.
   The study has provided the information researchers use to
determine how much an elevated cholesterol level, for example, or
hypertension, increases a person's risk of heart disease.
   Kannel and the American Heart Association announced the
development of a ``risk factor prediction kit'' that will enable
doctors to better estimate patients' heart disease risks.
   The kit, based on the Framingham data, allows doctors to
calculate the heart disease or stroke risk associated with a given
combination of risk factors, Kannel said.
   ``We need a more efficient profile to pick out the ones who are
truly in jeopardy,'' Kannel said at the heart association's annual
meeting.
   He said 30 percent to 40 percent of Americans, for example, have
cholesterol levels high enough to require treatment.
   Many of those might not have substantially increased
heart-disease risks, however, Kannel said.
   A patient with mildly high cholesterol and no other risk factors
may have only one-tenth the increased risk of a patient with the
same cholesterol level who also has high blood pressure, is
overweight and smokes, Kannel said.
   ``The problem everybody hasn't fully appreciated is that the
risk varies over a 10-fold range'' for each single risk factor,
depending upon what other risk factors are found in combination
with it, he said.
   The major controllable risk factors for heart disease are
cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the
heart association says.
   Other risk factors can't be changed. Increasing age raises the
risk as does a family history of heart disease. And men have
substantially higher risks than women.
   The risk factor prediction kit takes into account age, sex,
cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking and the level of high-density
lipoproteins, the so-called good cholesterol.
   It shows, for example, that a 60-year-old man whose only risk
factor is an elevated cholesterol level of 240 has a 13 percent
chance of having a heart attack during the next 10 years.
   If his blood pressure is high, that risk could jump to 18
percent or 20 percent, and if he smokes it would be even higher.
   The risk factor prediction kit, which is intended for use by
doctors, will be followed by a similar kit intended to give
patients some idea of their risks so they can decide whether to see
a doctor for a better evaluation.
   ``Feeling well is no guarantee against a heart attack,'' Kannel
said. ``One in five men have heart attacks before age 60, and one
in three of them aren't going to make it out of the room,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Pilot error and technical failure
were cited Thursday as possible causes of the crash of an Alitalia
DC-9 jetliner that killed all 46 people aboard when it slammed into
a wooded hillside.
   Seven Americans were identified Thursday as being among the 40
passengers killed when Flight AZ404 from Milan crashed late
Wednesday five miles outside Zurich's international airport. Six
Italian crew members also died.
   Pope John Paul II sent a message of condolence to the victims'
families.
   Bodies remained trapped inside the fire-gutted wreckage 24 hours
after the crash. Police said identification could take weeks as
most victims were burned beyond recognition.
   White sheets concealed human remains scattered among charred
plane wreckage and scorched tree stumps on the rain-soaked ground
Thursday.
   A notepad that survived the inferno lay open among the debris.
The green, red and white Alitalia emblem was still visible through
ashes covering the jetliner's tail, which was lying upside down.
   Rain hampered efforts to retrieve the victims and inspect the
wreckage.
   Eugen Thomann, a Zurich police official, said it appeared all
victims were killed on impact.
   Zurich airport spokesman Andreas Meier said witness accounts
suggested several causes for the crash.
   But he said radar data indicated ``the pilot misjudged his
altitude.'' He said the plane was flying about 1,000 feet below the
normal altitude during the landing approach.
   Alitalia officials told Italian television that failure of the
plane's electronic navigation system was also a possibility.
   Meier said terrorism was being considered, but stressed there
were no indications the airplane was the target of an attack.
   Most of the passengers on the late-evening flight linking two
financial centers were probably businessmen and people on personal
visits, rather than tourists, he said.
   Investigators found both the aircraft's flight recorders, or
``black boxes.'' One recorder tracks flight data and the other
tapes cockpit conversations.
   Meanwhile, Italian government investigators arrived to assist in
the inquiry.
   Witnesses in villages near the scene of the crash said something
appeared wrong with the approaching aircraft.
   ``I ran outside because the plane was so loud,'' said one
resident, who insisted on anonymity. ``Then I saw that the plane
was flying unusually low and seemed to be swaying.''
   Other witnesses said the pilot seemed to rev the plane's engine
just before the crash. ``It sounded like a sudden roar,'' one
villager said. ``But then there was a thud and it turned deathly
quiet.''
   There were also accounts of fire and ``apparent explosions''
before the plane went down, but officials were unable to confirm
those accounts.
   ``I shudder every time I think how near the village the plane
crashed,'' said a shocked woman in Stadel, about half a mile from
the crash site.
   The two-engine jetliner was on schedule on its 50-minute flight
from Milan. The Swiss Meteorological Office said visibility at the
time of the crash was good, with light wind and light rain.
   Josef Meier (cq), a spokesman for Swiss air traffic control
authorities, told reporters radar records showed the plane was
horizontally on course but flying about 990 feet below the correct
altitude.
   Traffic was heavy at the time and controllers did not
continuously monitor the jet's height, he said, adding that this
was normal procedure.
   Radio contact was normal until two minutes before the crash and
controllers received no distress signal, officials said. They said
the investigation could take months.
   Alitalia said the DC-9 was built in 1974 and was last inspected
on Nov. 4.
   The flight commander Raffaele Liberta, 47, was a 20-year
Alitalia veteran who had flown more than 10,000 hours.
   The U.S. embassy in Bern identified the American victims as
Karol Forman, Paul Vaughan and William Briggs of New York state;
John Stuckey and Jerry Bass of North Carolina; Robert Anderson, an
American resident of Switzerland, and Stephen Ritter, for whom they
had no further information.

   U.S. Rep. Jim Bates, who was
reprimanded by the House for the alleged sexual harassment of staff
members, has been defeated for re-election, the county Registrar of
Voters said Thursday.
   Republican Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, a former Navy pilot,
received 50,335 votes, or 46.3 percent, to Bates' 48,676 votes, or
44.8 percent.
   The results of the election had been delayed while local
officials counted thousands of absentee ballots. Authorities said
about 200 absentee ballots remained outstanding and would not
affect the outcome.
   Bates, 49, the only Democratic congressman south of Los Angeles,
has declined to concede defeat.
   He was reprimanded by the House ethics committee, stemming from
complaints by two female staffers in September 1988 that he
sexually harassed them. The current election was the first time he
faced voters since the committee's decision.
   During the campaign, Bates said the reprimand was an old issue.
If voters were concerned about it, he said, they would have thrown
him out in the June primary.

   Wayne Johnson said he wanted the perfect

from a store. Now he'll be spending Christmas in jail.
   Johnson, 34, pleaded guilty Wednesday to shoplifting for taking
five $12.95 Bibles from a Waldenbooks store and has been sentenced
to two years in prison.
   Assistant District Attorney Ricky Raven said an off-duty police
officer who was working security at the store Tuesday night noticed
an odd bulge in Johnson's clothes and followed him outside.
   Johnson, who has been in and out of the Harris County Jail on
five separate misdemeanor theft cases since 1985, was arrested in

   The Republican National Committee is cutting
its staff 25 percent, a reduction party officials say is normal for
the start of a non-election year.
   ``We gear up in the even years and we gear down in the odd
years,'' said Mary Matalin, RNC executive director. The committee
has about 270 fulltime employees.
   B.J. Cooper, communications director for the committee, said a
comparable staff reduction occurred four years ago, after the 1986
midterm elections.
   Matalin and Cooper denied published reports the cutbacks were
forced by a disappointing fund-raising year or were ordered by
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   ``We're 100 percent supportive of their effort to shift gears,''
said Ed Rogers, White House political director. ``There was no
instruction to do anything out of here; it's part of a longstanding
plan. The White House was informed of it on an FYI basis the day
before yesterday.''
   The RNC had an operating budget for 1990 of $26 million and
raised more than enough to cover it.
   At the Democratic National Committee, spokeswoman Ginny Terzano
said no immediate cutbacks are planned. But the DNC is a much
leaner operation with only 100 fulltime employees.
   The Democrats raised just over $10 million in 1990, including a
record $2.7 million Wednesday night at the party's annual gala.

<HEAD>Gorbachev to Face `Moment of Truth' Before Legislature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be ready for political
battle when he addresses the legislature Friday and is confident
his views will prevail, said an Italian leader who met the Soviet
president Thursday.
   The official Tass news agency, in a commentary, said Gorbachev
would face a ``moment of truth'' when he speaks to lawmakers on the
crumbling economy and on campaigns by separatist-minded republics.
   Gorbachev agreed to address the legislators after lawmakers,
angered by the slow pace of reform, demanded a report on the state
of the union.
   They similarly wanted a report on Gorbachev's weekend meeting
with Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin. Yeltsin also
will speak to the national legislature Friday, Tass said.
   Achille Occhetto, leader of the Italian Communist Pary, met in
Moscow with Gorbachev on Thursday and said Gorbachev was candid
about the country's economic and political problems.
   Gorbachev predicted that the next 18 months would be crucial to
his political and economic reforms, Occhetto said. During that
time, the country will be trying to switch from a centrally planned
to a market economy.
   Soviet economists have predicted unemployment and inflation will
worsen during the transition. Some goods have disappeared from
stores and prices have risen fast, squeezing retirees and other
people with fixed incomes. In many cases, food is being rationed.
   ``I feel Gorbachev is self-confident and ready for political
battle,'' Occhetto said at a news conference. ``I feel he will be
the master of the situation.''
   Soviet television said Thursday that Gorbachev would speak to
the legislature about the ``sharply worsening'' conditions in the
country.
   According to Tass, legislators at the Supreme Soviet became
rebellious Wednesday and refused to discuss bills ``suggested from
above'' until a new treaty on relations between the Kremlin and the
republics is concluded.
   Many of the country's 15 republics, especially Russia, are
disregarding laws passed by the national legislature and decrees
adopted by Gorbachev and the Council of Ministers, or Soviet
Cabinet.
   The legislature of Russia on Thursday heard a report on the
economic and political situation in the republic from government
leaders, Tass said. It said the session was held behind closed
doors, and no details were released.
   A day earlier, the Russian government said a Soviet decision to
lift price controls on ``luxury goods'' would not be implemented in
the republic. The Moscow City Council seconded the Russian
government's action.
   One prominent Soviet politician said the military might have to
be called in to restore order.
   ``If the constitution is trampled upon and some forces -
separatists or other anti-socialist associations - attempt to
dismember this country or change its social system by force or
other anti-constitutional means, the armed forces can be used,''
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, a member of the national legislature and
Gorbachev adviser, wrote in the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   Moldavia's leaders also balked at freeing prices. Deputy Premier
Konstantin Tampiza told the Moldavian Parliament the measure was
``not even worth discussing, let alone ratifying'' until action is
coordinated with other republics, Tass said.
   The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan similarly decided to
defy the Kremlin. Its Parliament said the resolution freeing prices
would have no effect in the republic, the independent news agency
Interfax reported.
   ``Prices are rising, but wages stay the same,'' said deputy Lev
Trybnikov. ``It's not a market, but downright robbery.''
   The leaders of all Soviet republics were invited to attend
Gorbachev's speech, but one republic declined the invitation. The
Estonian News Agency said Arnold Ruutel, president of the Estonian
republic, would not attend because ``the Soviet constitution is not
valid on Estonian territory.''
   Battles were also raging within the Kremlin.
   A national government commission ordered the Railroad Ministry
to cancel plans to stop accepting rubles as payment for trips
abroad.
   The ministry had said passengers leaving the country would have
to pay in foreign currency starting. The government's foreign
economic commission, part of the Council of Ministers, told the
railroad minister to rescind it.
   Tass said the confrontations were part of the ``progressing
paralysis of power.''
   The news agency said Gorbachev's speech was expected to include
specific proposals to reverse the deteriorating situation in the
country.
   ``Will Gorbachev justify the expectations?'' Tass asked. ``The
most radical-minded critics express doubt on that score, pointing
out that Gorbachev - a master at subtle multi-option moves - lacks
resoluteness when hard decisions need to be made.''
   But, the news agency said, Gorbachev supporters in the Supreme
Soviet blame his heavy workload for delays in reaching accord with
the restive republics.
   ``He tries to reduce to the minimum even major visits abroad and
makes them mainly over weekends, leaving weekdays for tackling
domestic problems,'' Tass said. Such visits are essential, it said,
because ``Gorbachev remains the Soviet Union's only politician with
whom Western leaders agree to do business.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee today opened
politically-charged hearings into links between five senators and
the owner of a failed savings and loan and the panel's chairman
bluntly told the lawmakers that many people believe ``you sold your
office.''
   Four of the so-called Keating Five looked on as Sen. Howell
Heflin said, ``many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that
your services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed,
that you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good
names for contributions and other benefits.''
   Sens. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Democrats John
Glenn of Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona each listened intently as Heflin spoke in his
gravely Southern accent. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is
undergoing prostate cancer treatment, did not attend. All five deny
any wrongdoing.
   Committee counsel Robert Bennett jostled a boxed puzzle before
the committee members as he began his opening statement, saying he
would provide them with a picture that later pieces of evidence
would fill in.
   Bennett said Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle ``were important
players'' in helping Keating in his ``all-out war'' with federal
regulators. He said McCain and Glenn played lesser roles.
   Bennett said he did not contend it was improper for the senators
to hold meetings with federal regulators, but that it was up to the
panel to decide whether their actions were improper. He said
``there can be no doubt'' that the intent of each of the five
senators was to help Keating when they met with federal regulators
in 1987.
   The five senators received a total of $1.3 million in campaign
contributions or donations to their favored causes from Keating and
his associates. All contacted federal regulators on behalf of
Keating at a time when the government was considering whether to
seize the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine,
Calif.-based thrift institution.
   The thrift later collapsed at an estimated cost to the taxpayers
of $2 billion.
   Heflin told the five they would have the chance to say whether
the donations ``influenced your actions in any way.''
   He said lawmakers' activities legitimately include helping their
constituents and overseeing government institutions and added that
there is room for disagreement about conclusions in the case.
   Bennett said the evidence will be clear despite the refusal of
Keating to answer questions during the Senate inquiry. Keating has
been indicted in California on state securities fraud charges and
is awaiting trial.
   ``One could ask the question, `If Mr. Keating were here, would
you believe what he had to say anyway?''' Bennett said.
   The five senators have become a symbol of the massive savings
industry collapse, and the outcome of the ethics hearings could
intensify the political ramifications of what so far has been a
bipartisan scandal.
   In addition, the case has highlighted a political system that
gives lawmakers great latitude in contacting federal regulators on
behalf of constituents, at the same time they are dependent on
campaign contributions to mount their political campaigns.
   The hearings stemmed from a complaint last year by the citizens
group Common Cause. ``It's not just the five senators but the whole
Senate whose integrity and credibility is on the line,'' said Fred
Werthheimer, the organization's leader.
   Heflin and others on the panel said the case should not create a
standard that bars members of Congress from intervening with
federal agencies on behalf of constituents or campaign
contributors.
   ``A standard of conduct which would preclude members of Congress
from intervening on behalf of individuals who happened to have
contributed to or raised funds for their campaign is nonsensical
and unworkable under existing law,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., another member of the committee,
complained that panel has taken too long with the case. ``We should
have already taken certain ... actions,'' he said.
   Heflin, D-Ala., defended the panel's decision to hold the
hearings against charges of partisanship. ``On all the votes taken
by the committee ... not one was divided along partisan lines,'' he
said.
   With documents stacked several inches high on a table covered
with green felt, Heflin framed the issue that the ethics panel will
have to grapple with:
   ``The allegation in this case, that an individual used his
wealth to get preferential treatment from government officials in
the performance of their official duties, raises questions which
are as old as history, and issues that bear on the balance of power
among the branches of the federal government.
   The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or recommend
a more serious punishment to the full Senate.
   Each senator has denied any connection between Keating's money
and their meetings with regulators. The basic issue is whether any
violated Senate rules against exerting improper influence in return
for compensation.
   All except Riegle attended an April 2, 1987, meeting with Ed
Gray, then the top thrift regulator. All five attended another
meeting a week later with San Francisco-based bank examiners who
revealed that potential criminal actions by Lincoln were involved.
   McCain's top aide, Chris Koch, said McCain would make the case
that he ended his friendship with Keating on March 24, 1987, when
Keating asked the senator to negotiate with regulators on his
behalf.
   ``There's no smoking gun on Don Riegle,'' the Michigan senator's
lawyer, Thomas Green, said before the hearing. He contended that
Riegle's meeting with regulators was unrelated to a fund-raising
effort Keating directed for Riegle.
   DeConcini wrote a letter to about 5,000 supporters this week
denying wrongdoing.
   ``You may hear derogatory statements about me and my office, but
I can assure you that I have not betrayed my public trust, nor do I
intend to be intimidated from assisting constituents in their
dealings with our government,'' DeConcini said.
   Glenn has said in the past that he had no discussions on behalf
of Lincoln after the 1987 meeting when regulators said criminal
charges were possible.
   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said Cranston contends,
``I pocketed no money, I broke no law, I violated no Senate rule.
Those are undisputed facts.''

<TEXT>
   The city's coalition government collapsed Thursday
in a dispute over a violent police crackdown on hundreds of leftist
squatters living in abandoned buildings.
   The environmental Greens party said it was bolting the two-party
coalition led by Social Democrat Mayor Walter Momper.
   The Greens say they were outraged by the massive police
crackdown over a three-day period that led to a series of violent
clashes, resulting in more than 260 injuries and about 450 arrests
since Monday.
   Gerd Poppe, a Greens candidate for the Bundestag, the lower
house of the German parliament, said ``the unbelievable police
presence'' triggered the violence.
   But Momper and other officials blamed the leftists, veteran
radicals from former West Berlin's anarchist scene who are adept at
making firebombs and staging urban guerrilla attacks.
   Hundreds have moved into rundown, vacant tenements in former
East Berlin.
   Berliners will elect a new city government on Dec. 2, when
elections will also be held to elect a united German government.
   Momper likely would govern with a minority until then. The
Greens move is seen as largely a symbolic gesture of protest.
   City officials began evicting leftist radicals on Monday. A huge
protest turned into a rock-throwing spree that resulted in 160
injuries and 20 arrests.
   On Wednesday, police moved into Mainzer Street, where radicals
were living in 12 large tenement buildings.
   Police, bolstered by crack paramilitary troops from the federal
border patrol, rolled in Wednesday morning with armored personnel
carriers and bulldozers and evicted the radicals.
   The radicals responded with firebombs and rocks. About 325
people were reported arrested and more than 100 were injured.
   Tens of thousands of people marched through Berlin on Wednesday
night to protest the raid and the lack of affordable housing in
Berlin. Later, some protesters began throwing rocks and firebombs
at police. Police said about 100 people were arrested.
   The crackdown on squatters in Berlin triggered sympathy protests
in other cities Wednesday night. Police reported a rash of window
smashings and other vandalism, along with graffiti expressing
sympathy for the squatters, in the cities of Cologne, Wuppertal,
Duesseldorf and Muenster during the night.
   Affordable housing has long been a problem in wealthy western
Germany, where people who make lower-than-average wages often have
a difficult time finding adequate housing. Germany has one of the
highest standards of living in the world.
   Many of eastern Berlin's squatters are Westerners who have taken
advantage of the general laxness of government and law enforcement
in the eastern side of the city since East Germans overthrew their
Communist rulers last year.
   Momper on Wednesday accused the conservative federal government
of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of neglecting Berlin's housing problem,
made worse as West Germany assumed responsibility for decayed
housing in the east.
   Also Thursday, the government said it planned to send more
police into former East Germany to curb growing violence at soccer
games.
   The clashes, which began after unification Oct. 3, came after
years of relatively peaceful league matches disturbed only by
occasional rightist ``skinheads'' in the west.
   Earlier this month, however, police shot and killed a soccer fan
during one rampage in Leipzig. Last weekend, riots erupted in two
eastern German cities after league matches.
   Chief of Staff, Rudolf Seiters, did not say how troops would be
dispatched to try to maintain order, but the disappearance of the
German-German frontier has freed up hundreds of specially trained
border guards for other law enforcement duties.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet-led Warsaw Pact will stop
functioning as a military alliance next July, a Hungarian Foreign
Ministry official said Thursday.
   ``There is now consensus to end the six-nation organization's
military functions July 1,'' said the official, Istvan Koermendi.
``This includes ending the multilateral agreements on the basis of
which the pact functioned.''
   The pact, which began to crumble with last year's democratic
changes in Eastern Europe, has lost any real role as a
counterweight to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Poland's Deputy Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said in
Warsaw that the ``common position'' of Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary was to work toward abolition of the pact's joint military
command and staff.
   ``At the moment, these institutions do not function,''
Onyszkiewicz said. ``They are completely frozen, and our armed
forces are under absolute control of the Polish command and the
Polish political authorities.''
   But he said at a news conference that no date had been set to
disband the alliance: ``This does not mean ... a verdict on the
Warsaw Pact has been issued, that it will be dissolved within the
next few months.''
   Onyszkiewicz said a date could be fixed at an upcoming pact
summit. Koermendi said top leaders from the pact nations would
probably meet in Budapest before the end of the year, possibly in
early December.
   Hungarian officials had earlier said in private that the pact
would disband as a military alliance by next summer, describing its
future role as a loose political forum.
   But Koermendi appeared to be the first Warsaw Pact official to
publicly announce a date for the end of its military role. He first
mentioned July 1 on Wednesday, to Parliament's foreign relations
committee, and then again in an interview Thursday.
   The pact, formed in 1955 in the early years of the Cold War,
menaced the West into the late 1980s.
   Originally comprised of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, it was
reduced to seven nations after Albania withdrew in 1968 following
the pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and a long ideological feud
with Moscow.
   The unification of the Germanys left only six member nations
that often advocate positions closer to the West than Moscow.
   The 16-nation NATO and the Warsaw Pact formally plan to end
their adversarial relationship next week, at a 34-nation summit of
the Conference on European Security and Cooperation.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday the 22
countries belonging to the two alliances will sign a
``non-aggression declaration which will, in a sense, bury the Cold
War hatchet.''
   Another treaty to be signed in Paris reduces non-nuclear forces
in Europe.

   The villagers have been declared the winners of a contest
sponsored by the Bristol Bay Native Association to encourage
Bristol Bay region voters to go to the polls. The winning village

Director Terry Hoefferle.
   The village is about 70 miles north of Dillingham on the
Nushagak River and 275 miles southwest of Anchorage. The native
association plans to fly a plane filled with up to 80 turkeys to
the village by Thanksgiving.
   Native leaders, at the urging of elections officials, have

distribution to all, not just to those who voted. No buying votes

   Leningrad's City Council voted Thursday to join
the growing list of Soviet cities rationing food, while the United
States and other Western nations considered sending emergency aid.
   Starting Dec. 1, Leningrad will ration meat, poultry, butter,
flour and other staples for the first time since the Nazis
blockaded it during World War II.
   Rationing also had been under debate in Moscow's City Council,
but it decided Thursday to delay taking action.
   As the country's economic crisis deepens, the list of cities
rationing food, and the number of goods they restrict, has been
increasing rapidly.
   Ration coupons are now in use in many cities across Russia and
the Ukraine. Meat, sugar and vodka are the mostly commonly
restricted items. Eggs, butter and flour are also rationed in some
areas.
   In Kharkov, a Ukrainian city of 1.6 million people,
demonstrators blocked streets this week to protest rationing and
the lack of basic foods in state stores, the government newspaper
Izvestia said Thursday.
   No starvation, or even chronic hunger, has been reported. But as
the country moves toward a market economy, goods have disappeared
from state stores and prices in private farmers' markets have risen
fast, squeezing retirees and other people with fixed incomes.
   In a public opinion poll published Wednesday in the weekly
Moscow News, 62 percent of those questioned said they ``fear hunger
will begin in the Soviet Union in the next few months.''
   The survey was conducted in October by the All-Union Center for
Study of Public Opinion, one of the nation's most respected
pollsters. It queried 1,356 people in 11 regions. No margin of
error was given.
   In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday his country was
ready to send emergency supplies, if needed. He also said he would
urge all Western industrial nations to prepare to help the Soviet
Union and Eastern European countries, ``especially in view of the
severe winter'' looming.
   In Washington, officials said the U.S. government was
considering airlifting food and medical supplies to the Soviet
Union.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, one of the nation's leading
reformist politicians, pushed hard for his city's rationing
program. Without it, he warned Monday, the city of nearly 5 million
people could face hunger and civil unrest this winter.
   In recent weeks, Leningrad residents have had to stand in
two-and three-hour lines for bread. Many other necessities -
including eggs, sugar, cheese and sausage - have virtually
disappeared from stores, according to Maxim Korzhov, a Leningrad
journalist covering the city council session.
   ``People here are upset and worried about food,'' Korzhov said.
``The atmosphere is tense.''
   Hunger is an intensely emotional and politically volatile
subject in Leningrad because of the 1941-1944 siege, when an
estimated 600,000 people died, many from starvation.
   Korzhov said public support for rationing increased after stores
throughout the city ran out of bread on Nov. 5 and 6, when
residents stocked up for the Nov. 7 holiday, the 73rd anniversary
of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   For decades, bread has been cheap, wholesome and plentiful
throughout the Soviet Union, ensuring that even the poorest
segments of the population - students, pensioners and the disabled
- would not go hungry.
   This year, bread has periodically become scarce in many cities,
including Moscow.
   The Soviet Union's food problem stems not only from inadequate
harvests, but also from inefficient transportation, packaging and
distribution. By some estimates, 15 percent to 20 percent of many
crops is lost to spillage, spoilage and theft.
   Food supplies to big cities, particularly in the north, also
have been disrupted this year by the country's political
fragmentation. Some of the most fertile republics, including
Armenia, Georgia and the Baltic states, have stopped shipping meat,
dairy products, citrus or other items outside their borders.
   The Leningrad Soviet, or city council, voted 296 to 10 with 68
abstentions to allot each resident a monthly ration of 2.6 pounds
of meat, 1.1 pounds of poultry, and 2.2 pounds of sausage.
   In addition, each person will be allocated 10 eggs, 1.1 pounds
of butter, 2.2 pounds of dry cereal or pasta, 1.1 pounds of flour
and 11 ounces of vegetable oil.
   Leningrad, the nation's second-largest city, already issues
coupons for 4.4 pounds of sugar, two bottles of vodka and two
bottles of wine per person. Those rations will remain in effect.
   Residents will be able to buy their allotments at state
subsidized prices, which are quite low: $4.5 to $6.50 for every 2.2
pounds of meat, $2 for 10 eggs, $6.50 for 2.2 pounds of butter.
   If Leningrad residents want more than their rationed amounts,
they will have to pay market prices, which are often 10 times
higher. The city council voted to remove price restrictions on food
sold in state stores without ration coupons.

   Here is background information about the
Senate Ethics Committee's hearings on the ``Keating Five''
senators.
   The five intervened with federal banking regulators on behalf of
Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of the failed Lincoln Savings
and Loan. They also received $1.3 million in political donations
for their campaigns and causes from Keating and his associates.
   The five are: Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats
Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and John Glenn of Ohio.
   All have denied that the contributions influenced their
intervention, and say their discussions with federal regulators on
Keating's behalf amounted to routine help for a constituent.
   Keating and three top executives of his companies have been
indicted in California on state securities fraud charges. All four
are out on bail pending trial.
   All the senators except Riegle met on April 2, 1987, with Edwin
J. Gray, the top thrift regulator at the time. Gray said DeConcini
offered a deal on behalf of Keating that the other senators
supported. The senators vehemently denied that the offer was made.
   A week later, all five senators met with San Francisco-based
regulators who told the lawmakers that criminal referrals in the
case would be made to the Justice Department.
   Here are key details about the conduct of each senator:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>John Glenn</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The three-term senator attended both the April 2 and April 9
meetings, but said he had no further contacts with regulators after
April 9, 1987.
   He told regulators at the April 9 hearing, according to a
transcript, ``To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their
backs.''
   Keating and associates raised $34,000 in campaign contributions
for Glenn and contributed another $200,000 to a political action
committee supporting the senator's views. Glenn is up for
re-election in 1992.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Alan Cranston</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Cranston has announced he will not run for a fifth term in 1992
because of prostate cancer, and did not seek re-election as
majority whip this week.
   Cranston received $850,000 for three voter registration projects
he supported and $39,000 in campaign contributions from Keating and
his associates.
   Cranston continued to intervene with banking officials up until
the time Lincoln was seized by the government in April 1989. He
said the continuing contacts were made to encourage regulators to
approve a sale of Lincoln rather than take control of the thrift.
   In October 1987, Cranston wrote a memo to Keating that mentioned
both the donations and the senator's intervention for the thrift
owner.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dennis DeConcini</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Documents show the three-term Democrat, facing re-election in
1994, assisted Keating in his bid to have Gray removed from the
examination of Lincoln.
   DeConcini maintained his contacts with the regulators until the
takeover, pushing for a sale of Lincoln rather than a takeover.
   Shortly after the federal government filed a fraud and
racketeering suit in September 1989 against Keating and American
Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent company, DeConcini said he was
returning the $48,100 he received in contributions from Keating and
associates. He said there was a ``serious possibility that money
from Lincoln Savings may have been illegally funneled into a number
of political campaigns.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>John McCain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The only Republican among the five, the second Arizona senator
in the case says he and Keating became close friends after becoming
acquainted in 1981.
   McCain said he ended his relationship with Keating in March
1987, shortly before the two meetings with regulators. McCain said
the break occurred after he refused to negotiate with regulators on
Keating's behalf.
   The senator received $112,000 in campaign contributions from
Keating and associates, and said he would return the money if it
was found to have been diverted from Lincoln.
   From 1984 through 1986, McCain flew on Keating's airplanes for
vacation trips to the Bahamas. In May and June 1989, the senator
paid back $13,433 for the cost of the flights.
   Also, McCain's wife and father-in-law invested in a shopping
center that was managed by subsidiaries of Keating's company.
McCain said he was not involved in the investment.
   Now serving his first Senate term, McCain faces re-election in
1992.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Donald W. Riegle Jr.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee chairman acknowledged suggesting to
Gray that he meet with senators unhappy over Lincoln's treatment by
regulators. But he denied setting up the April 2 meeting, which he
did not attend, or the April 9 meeting.
   Documents revealed that in the two months before Riegle's April
1987 meeting with regulators, there was an extensive fund-raising
operation for the senator led by Keating, with assistance from
DeConcini.
   Riegle, who raised $78,250 from Keating and associates, said he
returned the money after learning the contributions had come from
individuals with a direct business affiliation with American
Continental, Keating's main company.
   Riegle has served in the Senate since 1976 and faces re-election
in 1994.

   Alydar the horse that ran second to
Affirmed in memorable 1978 Triple Crown races and became an
influential sire, was destroyed Thursday at Calumet Farms after
breaking his injured right leg.
   The 15-year-old Alydar, who sired such champions as Alysheba,
Easy Goer and Turkoman, kicked his stall door late Tuesday and
underwent surgery Wednesday.
   Dr. Larry Bramlage, who helped operate on the chestnut stallion,
said Thursday: ``It was either maintain him in a tranquilized state
... or wean him out of the sling. Fifteen minutes after it was off,
he slipped and fell, breaking his right femur.''
   The second injury was to the same leg.
   The horse was buried at the farm, where he had stood at stud
since 1979.
   Alydar and Affirmed began their epic duel in their 2-year-old
season and the rivalry culminated in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness
and Belmont Stakes. Affirmed won all three races by a total of less
than three lengths.
   Alydar had quite a few notable victories, including the Florida
Derby, Blue Grass Stakes and Arlington Stakes.

<TEXT>
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators reached
agreement Thursday on a treaty cutting non-nuclear weapons in
Europe, ending decades of Cold War discord between the military
alliances.
   Senior diplomats said negotiators from the 22 nations comprising
both alliances, had agreed on a final text for the most sweeping
weapons accord in history and had sent the treaty to their capitals
for approval.
   Last-minute objections from home were not expected. The 70-page,
English text was to be translated into the five other official
languages for initialing Sunday by delegation heads, the officials
said.
   The texts were to be formally signed a day later by heads of
states gathered in Paris for the 34-nation Conference on Security
and European cooperation. The Monday deadline had put the Vienna
negotiators under the gun.
   ``We actually had consensus on the big issues since the
beginning of October,'' said Hungary's chief negotiator, Ambassador
Istvan Gyarmati. ``But some relatively minor details needed ironing
out.''
   The treaty covers an area from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
mountains in the Soviet Union. It sets ceilings on non-nuclear
weapons systems, regulates troop movements, and permits mutual
inspections to verify that the terms of the treaty are not being
contravened.
   Negotiators originally had also sought agreement on troop
reductions, but participants agreed to suspend that track so the
treaty could be ready for signing at the Paris summit.
   Delegates were to reconvene in Vienna Nov. 29 to discuss cuts in
personnel.
   But a formal pledge in September by Germany to maintain no more
than 375,000 troops after unification on Oct. 3 eased fears of the
Soviet Union, which lost millions of people during World War II.
Delegates in Vienna said the issue of troop cuts had become
relatively unimportant.
   ``The importance of numbers of soldiers declines if they don't
have a gun to fire,'' said a negotiator with one nation in the
16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The treaty limits each side to 20,000 main battle tanks; 30,000
armored combat vehicles; 20,000 pieces of artillery; 6,800 combat
aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters.
   Those ceiling were agreed on earlier, and a negotiator from a
Warsaw Pact country said last-minute differences were relatively
arcane.
   ``There were things like a clearer definition of the southern
Leningrad (military) district,'' another delegate said on condition
of anonymity.
   The negotiations, formally known as the Conventional Force
Europe talks began March 9, 1989, after NATO and the Warsaw Pact
decided to scrap earier negotiations aimed at cutting conventional
troops and arms in Central Europe.
   Those talks were a victim of the Cold War; little substantive
progress was reached in 17 years of wrangling over a wide range of
issues, including existing troop strengths and means of
verification.
   NATO figures published two months before the new talks began
listed the following figures for the two military alliances.
   Main battle tanks: Warsaw Pact, 51,500; NATO, 16,424.
   Armored combat vehicles: Warsaw Pact, 22,400; NATO, 4,153.
   Artillery: Warsaw Pact, 43,400; NATO, 14,458.
   Helicopters: Warsaw Pact, 3,700; NATO, 2,419.
   Combat Aircraft: Warsaw Pact, 8,250; NATO, 3,977.
   But at the new talks the two sides decided to concentrate on
target strengths and ignore how many soldiers and weapons each side
had in an effort to avoid past deadlocks.
   Soviet political and economic reforms, which fed warming
superpower relations in the past year, gave the current talks even
more impetus and led to the swift progress that had eluded previous
attempts to limit weapons.
   The end of Communist rule in Moscow's former European satellites
this year also hastened the Vienna negotiations, with former Soviet
vassal states acting with increasing independence.
   Hungarian officials said Thursday that the Warsaw Pact - reduced
to six members with the unification of Germany - would cease its
military activities by July.

   A chemical plant explosion seriously
injured one worker Thursday and may have blown another into the
Missouri River, authorities said.
   The blast at Nutra-Flo Chemical Co. occurred as two workers
welded atop a silo-like storage tank, fire officials said. The tank
was about a third full of anhydrous ammonia, a toxic fertilizer.
   ``We believe the ignition source was a torch used on the top to
weld a ladder,'' said Fire Chief Bob Hamilton.
   One man fell from the tank and was hospitalized in serious
condition. The other welder was missing.
   Welding rods that officials believe had been used by the missing
worker were found along the river about 100 feet away. Rescuers
searched the river for the worker.

   President Bush, saying every American
``deserves to breathe clean air,'' on Thursday signed an extensive
overhaul of the nation's anti-pollution law to curb acid rain,
urban smog and toxic chemicals.
   Susan Merrow, president of the Sierra Club, described the Clean
Air Act of 1990 as ``a breath of fresh air after a 10-year smog
alert.''
   Bush said the bill, which updates and tightens federal air
pollution standards for the first time since 1977, was ``simply the
most significant air pollution legislation in our nation's
history.''
   ``This bill means cleaner cars, cleaner power plants, cleaner
factories, and cleaner fuels. And it means a cleaner America,''
Bush said at a packed White House ceremony.
   The goal of the legislation is to cut acid rain pollutants by
half, sharply reduce urban smog and eliminate most of the toxic
chemical emissions from industrial plants by the turn of the
century.
   The cost of adhering to the regulations is expected to be as
much as $25 billion a year.
   Environmental groups temporarily put aside their differences
with the president on other issues to praise his effort on clean
air. But they said the effectiveness of the legislation would
require aggressive implementation and enforcement by the federal
government.
   Richard Ayers, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition,
called the legislation ``cause for celebration and hope.''
   But Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action,
said Bush's signature marked ``only the first step toward cleaning
up our air. There are dozens of provisions that must be implemented
through regulation.''
   Industry representatives, facing large compliance costs, were
more muted in their approval.
   ``While business supports the act's clean air objectives, its
costs to American consumers and workers cannot be sugarcoated,''
said William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group,
a coalition of 2,000 businesses and trade associations.
   Bush's signature capped a decade-long debate over anti-pollution
rules. The legislation was the product of 16 months of intensive
wrangling among administration and congressional negotiators over
myriad technical provisions.
   The new law requires tougher emission controls on cars, and
requires service stations to sell cleaner-burning gas. It mandates
new equipment in thousands of businesses and factories to capture
smog-causing pollutants and toxic chemicals.
   It also requires coal-burning power plants to cut in half sulfur
dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain.
   Some of the new requirements will begin to be phased in within a
few years, but most won't be fully in place until the end of the
decade. Some cities with the worst smog problems have as long as 15
to 20 years to meet federal air requirements.
   Bush, fulfilling a campaign promise, proposed in July 1989 a
broad rewrite of the clean air laws. Earlier efforts to revamp the
laws had been blocked by strong opposition from economic and
regional interests and the Reagan administration.
   ``No American should have to drive out of town to breathe clean
air,'' Bush said. ``Every city in America should have clean air.
With this legislation I firmly believe we will. Every American
expects and deserves to breathe clean air.''
   But while some environmentalists praised the president for the
clean air legislation, others were harshly critical of his
opposition to designating Antarctica a wilderness preserve. Such
action would bar mineral and oil explorations.
   The Alliance for Antarctica urged the United States to change
its position as a multination conference began in Antarctica.

   The number of people with diabetes rose 17
percent in the United States during 1980-87, an increase federal
health researchers attributed Thursday to the aging of America.
   The largest increase was among white males, though diabetes
remains most prevalent among black females, the Centers for Disease
Control said in its weekly report.
   In a related report by the CDC, a study of diabetes in 1988-89
found that it was most prevalent in Eastern states, with the
highest rate in the District of Columbia. Diabetes was least
prevalent in Montana.
   The 38-state study of prevalence by race and sex found that
during the seven-year period the number of white males with
diabetes mellitus, the most common form of the condition, increased
33 percent - from 2.1 million to 2.8 million. The increase among
black females was 24 percent and black males 16 percent; white
females remained unchanged.
   Minorities continue to be more susceptible to diabetes, the CDC
said. In 1987, for example, the prevalence among black females was
more than twice that among white females - 50.9 cases per 1,000
black females compared with 23.4 per 1,000 white females.
Prevalence among black males was about one-third higher than for
white males, the CDC said.
   For the nation as a whole, the CDC said, diabetes increased from
5.8 million people in 1980 to 6.8 million people in 1987.
   The CDC's estimates were based on self-reported cases, which
health officials believe is about half the total cases. The report
was based on a household survey of 120,000 U.S. residents who were
asked if anyone in the family had diabetes during the previous 12
months.
   ``Most of it (the increase) is explained by the aging of the
U.S.,'' said David Olson, a statistician with the Atlanta-based
CDC's Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,
which prepared the report.
   ``Now there's a higher proportion of people with greater age,''
Olson said. ``With increased age there is a higher frequency of
diabetes.''
   Olson said health officials are not sure why diabetes occurs
more among minority groups, though some believe it is because
blacks, Hispanics and Indians tend to have less access to
preventive medicine.
   Dr. Jeff Newman, an epidemiologist at the CDC's chronic disease
branch, said the higher incidence of diabetes among minorities
probably explained the regional differences in the state-by-state
study.
   ``The states that have large proportions of these groups do have
a higher prevalence,'' he said.
   Newman said the state study was primarily for help in planning
local prevention programs, and he cautioned against drawing any
conclusions about anything in the states themselves that might be
increasing the risk of diabetes.
   The District of Columbia showed the highest prevalence, with 8.7
cases per 100 people. Other states with more than six cases per 100
included Michigan, with 7.1; Hawaii, 6.4; Alabama, 6.2; South
Carolina, 6.1; and West Virginia, 6.1.
   Montana had the lowest prevalence, with 2.8 cases per 100
people. Other states with fewer than four per 100 included
Minnesota, with 3.2; Maryland, 36; Oklahoma, 3.6; South Dakota,
3.8; Utah, 3.8; Arizona, 3.9, and Nebraska, 3.9.
   The CDC said that in 1987, costs associated with medical care
and lost productivity due to diabetes amounted to $20.4 billion.
   ``Based on the increase in the number of people with (diabetes
mellitus), the substantial economic and health care burden ... is
expected to increase,'' the CDC report said.

<HEAD>US Concerned About Shift Of Soviet Tanks To Siberia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the most sweeping arms reduction treaty in
history awaited President Bush's signature, U.S. officials on
Thursday registered concern about the transfer of thousands of
Soviet tanks to Siberia from Eastern Europe.
   The officials stressed that the tanks and other equipment
shifted east of the Ural Mountains could not be excluded from the
cutbacks required by the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.
   But they said the Soviets had given assurances that some of the
weapons were destroyed and most of the rest would be put to the
torch.
   The treaty is to be signed on Monday in Paris by Bush, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the leaders of 20 other NATO and
Warsaw Pact countries.
   It is the most ambitious arms control accord in history and was
aimed at reducing Cold War tensions between East and West. Even
before the treaty's conclusion the Soviets under Gorbachev
undertook major reductions in Eastern and Central Europe. The
treaty makes many of these cutbacks legally binding.
   With the signing deadline only four days away, U.S. officials
said some details still had to be ironed out. They mostly concern
procedures to verify that the reductions in tanks, anti-aircraft
artillery, armored personnel carriers, aircraft and helicopters are
carried out.
   Diplomats in Vienna said, however, that negotiators for the two
military alliances had reached tentative agreement on treaty terms.
   The treaty will allow NATO and the Warsaw Pact each to keep
20,000 battle tanks, 30,000 armored combat vehicles, 20,000 pieces
of artillery, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters.
   The cutbacks are far deeper on the Warsaw Pact side, and in that
sense represents a triumph for the Bush administration.
   But the transfer of Soviet tanks and other arms east of the Ural
Mountains - beyond the 2.5 million square miles covered by the
treaty - drew attention here even though the main U.S. goals had
been accomplished.
   ``This is not a new issue,'' a senior U.S. official told
reporters at the White House. ``We have made it clear to the Soviet
Union from the beginning that since the treaty deals only with
Europe, we wanted to ensure there would be no buildup in the Soviet
Union east of the Urals that would circumvent the treaty.''
   At the same time, the official said, the Bush administration had
put pressure on the Soviets to withdraw their forces from Eastern
Europe. As a result, tanks and other weapons were pulled back to
Siberia.
   That positions them beyond the area where East-West tensions
were high and where the United States wanted Soviet weapons held to
a minimum.
   On Sunday, the day before the treaty signing, the two alliances
will exchange information about the size of their non-nuclear
arsenals assigned to Europe. Then, over 40 months, they will be
obliged to destroy all weapons above the ceilings set by the
treaty.
   The restriction applies to material assigned to the European
arsenal that may have been moved elsewhere, including the tanks in
Siberia and tanks and other non-nuclear weapons the United States
has sent to the Persian Gulf in a military buildup designed to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``Obviously, we are concerned about movements to the East of the
Urals,'' said the senior official, whose identity was shielded
under White House briefing rules. ``The Soviet Union has assured us
that some of the equipment has already been destroyed and that much
of the rest will be destroyed.''
   The treaty will establish inspection procedures and other ways
of monitoring the cutbacks are carried out. The official
acknowledged that Soviet territory east of the Ural Mountains would
not be covered. But he said the United States had other detection
means of making sure the Soviets do not store tanks and other arms
in excess of treaty ceilings.

   The son of Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan Jr. was ordered held without bail Thursday on a charge of
raping a woman whose apartment he was accused of entering while
armed with a shotgun.
   Prosecutor Randy Sengel argued during a brief court hearing that
Robert Jeffrey Lujan, 28, posed a danger to society and should not
be allowed to remain free on bond.
   Sengel also said Lujan, known as Jeff, had been convicted in
1983 on a federal charge of cocaine possession.
   Alexandria Judge Daniel O'Flaherty revoked the $2,000 bond on
which Lujan had been released several hours after his arrest
Wednesday night.
   The judge scheduled a preliminary hearing for Friday.
   Lujan, who did not enter a plea, is charged with raping a
48-year-old woman who lives in the same high-rise apartment
building where he resides with his parents, police said.
   The woman told police she was awakened about 4:30 a.m. Sunday by
a man carrying a shotgun, authorities said. There was no sign of
forced entry into the woman's apartment, according to the police
report.
   Defense lawyer Robert Stanley Powell said Jeff Lujan was invited
to the woman's apartment for a drink on Saturday night and the two
had sex.
   ``They had both been drinking. They met up in the elevator and
she invited him in for a drink,'' Powell said. ``The only issue
here is one of consent.''
   Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Lujan was
with his parents at their apartment when he was arrested at 8 p.m.
Wednesday.
   The younger Lujan, a house painter, had recently moved back into
his parents' apartment in this Washington suburb, Goldstein said.
   Lujan kept to his normal schedule Thursday.
   Goldstein said the secretary didn't go to the jail Wednesday
night or to Thursday's hearing because he didn't want to be seen as
trying to influence the outcome of the case.
   ``It is difficult for the Lujans,'' Goldstein said. ``Any other
parents would have the opportunity to plead for their child. The
secretary recognizes that he is not any other parent.''
   The Lujans ``love their son and they are going to stand by
him,'' Goldstein said.
   Jeff Lujan, one of the secretary's four children, was sentenced
in 1983 to an unspecified term as a youthful offender for
possession of cocaine and use of a telephone in a drug transaction
in New Mexico. At the time, his father was a Republican congressman
from the state.
   He served was imprisoned for several months at a federal
facility in Englewood, Colo., Goldstein said.
   He originally had been charged with two counts each of cocaine
possession and trafficking, but pleaded guilty to the two
possession charges under a deal with federal prosecutors.
   His lawyer said Jeff Lujan also was convicted in 1987 of driving
while intoxicated and driving with a suspended license and served a
one-year prison term.
   At the time of the 1983 sentencing, Lujan said his son was being
treated for ``a big alcohol problem'' that came to light when he
was arrested on the drug charges.

   Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez
Assad of Syria on Thursday effectively killed efforts to bring Arab
leaders together in an emergency summit aimed at averting war in
the Persian Gulf.
   The two leaders said they rejected King Hassan of Morocco's call
for a summit because Iraq insisted on holding onto Kuwait. On
Wednesday, Saudi Arabia said it would not participate unless
Baghdad promised beforehand that it would leave Kuwait.
   Hassan proposed the summit Sunday as a possible ``last chance''
for peace.
   Mubarak, returning Thursday from a visit to Libya and Syria,
stressed that ``no one wants war,'' and he said he would continue
to make every effort to find a peaceful solution to the crisis
rather than ``open the doors of hell.''
   The Egyptian leader also said he had asked President Bush to
wait for three months before turning to military action to force
Iraq out of Kuwait. He did not say when he made the request.
   In Damascus, a statement released by Assad's office said the two
presidents ``expressed their regret for Iraq's rejection of any
political settlement that aims at restoring the situation in Kuwait
to what it was prior to Aug. 2.''
   Both Egypt and Syria have contributed to Arab forces among the
U.S.-led multinational force confronting Iraq, which numbers about
300,000.
   Assad and Mubarak's statement effectively killed any chance of
the summit taking place, despite the fact the fact that a few Arab
League members, including Sudan and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, had agreed to Morocco's proposal.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile also rejected the idea Thursday.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Mubarak told editors
traveling with him that he would ``undertake every possible
effort'' to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
   Hassan's proposal had raised interest in Moscow, and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent envoys to the region to sound
out leaders on the idea.
   But Mubarak's chief political aide, Osama el-Baz, said after a
meeting Thursday in Cairo with Soviet envoy Alexander Bologonov
that the possibility of a peaceful solution is ``getting smaller
every day.''
   Iraq itself has said it would attend a summit on condition that
earlier Arab League calls for its withdrawal from Kuwait be
scrapped.
   Twelve Arab League members, including Egypt and the gulf states,
voted at a summit in August to condemn the invasion of Kuwait and
approve the dispatch of foreign forces to defend Saudi Arabia.
   Iraq, Libya and the PLO voted against the resolution. Jordan,
Sudan and Mauritania had reservations, and Algeria and Yemen
abstained. Tunis was not present.

<HEAD>Again Americans Try to Butt Out During Great American Smokeout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS J. ROWE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A classical music radio station asked its listeners to ``bust
your butt for Bernstein,'' in honor of the late conductor, a heavy
smoker who died last month, and folks with smokes nationwide tried
to stop their tokes Thursday.
   As part of the 14th annual Great American Smokeout, the first 50
listeners to call New York City station WNCN-FM and pledge to quit
for the day received a compact disc of ``Leonard Bernstein's
Greatest Hits.''
   Anti-smoking advocates maintain that the effort to get people to
kick the habit for a day has seen such romantic images as the
Marlboro man and teen-age rebels fall into history's ashtray.
   ``It's a day of celebration,'' Surgeon General Antonia Novello
said in Washington. ``Because it's a time when smokers can realize
that the road to good health begins with one smoke-free day, and
then one more, and one more ...''
   It also was a day for rallies and other events from coast to
coast.
   The American Cancer Society again estimated that 18 million
smokers - more than one-third of the smoking population - would
attempt to quit at least for the day. Of that number last year, 5
million made it through the day and 3 million managed not to smoke
for four days or more, Ms. Novello said.
   The surgeon general has called for a smokeless society by the
year 2000. And in recent years numerous cities and counties have
enacted restrictive smoking laws. Taboo, too, is smoking on
domestic airline flights.
   ``You're more socially acceptable if you're a heroin addict,''
complained Patty Prickett, a California environmentalist who's
tried to quit smoking six times but still consumes two packs a day.
   Anti-smoking advocates and smokers' rights activists staged
separate rallies about an hour apart Thursday on opposite sides of
the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. Neither session drew large crowds.
   Anti-smoking groups objected to the Philip Morris Co.'s
sponsorship of a national tour of the Bill of Rights, which is
going on display Monday in Boston.
   ``Here you have Philip Morris, which is literally a drug-pushing
organization, profiting from drug addiction, wrapping itself in the
Bill of Rights,'' Ed Sweda, head of the Boston-based Group Against
Smoking Pollution, said in testimony before a Massachusetts
legislative committee.
   Philip Morris is running an extensive advertising campaign and
transporting an original copy of the Bill of Rights to all 50
states to highlight the 200th anniversary of the document's
ratification.
   Female doctors wearing lab coats and stethoscopes and health
advocates in tennis whites planned to picket Thursday night at
Madison Square Garden to protest Virginia Slims' sponsorship of the
women's tennis tournament there.
   In North Carolina, the nation's largest producer of flue-cured
tobacco, the Great American Smokeout constitutes the Great American
Fizzle year after year.
   ``It's always been our position that the American Cancer Society
should be spending its money on cancer research and cancer
treatments rather than public relations stunts,'' said Maura Payne,
a spokeswoman with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem.
   ``I think a lot of other states approach tobacco differently
than we do,'' said Lisa Poovey, a spokeswoman for the North
Carolina chapter of the American Cancer Society in Raleigh.
   ``I hear of some of the things the happen in other states,
particularly with anti-smoking groups, and think, `Gee, we'd get
mobbed if we did that here.'
   ``It's been our practice in North Carolina to approach smoking
as a pro-health issue and not an anti-smoking issue.''
   One Raleigh radio station gave out ``cold turkeys'' as a way of
promoting the smokeout.
   And in Charlotte, a smokeout supporter dressed as an
old-fashioned cigarette girl was taking cigarettes rather than
dispensing them. Smokers who handed over their cigarettes got a
balloon, gum or some other item in exchange.
   For some die-hards, however, all the hoopla was a drag.
   George Follman, vice president of a hang glider and windsurfing
company in Newport Beach, Calif., has smoked for 20 years. He's
even smoked while hang gliding.
   He quit a decade ago, but returned to it after a 1981 accident
while riding an ultralight airplane. He crashed in a rice paddy but
was unhurt.
   The first thing he did when rescuers came: Borrow a cigarette.
   His plans for the Great American Smokeout?
   ``I intend to smoke my brains out,'' he said.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday that
Germany will send emergency supplies to the Soviet Union in case of
a food crisis this winter.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said the Bush administration is
also developing contingency plans to provide emergency food and
medicine to the Soviet Union to tide it through the winter.
   The announcements came on the same day that Leningrad's City
Council voted to begin widescale food rationing on Dec. 1 - for the
first time since the Nazi siege in World War II.
   Kohl spoke during a special session of Parliament in which he
summarized his talks last weekend with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The opposition convened the session to discuss the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The chancellor told legislators that during talks with Gorbachev
on Friday he promised that Germany would assist the Soviet Union
financially ``to the best of our powers.'' The talks followed the
signing of a far-reaching cooperation and non-aggression treaty
between the two countries.
   Specifically, he said, Germany would send emergency shipments of
food to the Soviet Union ``in case of acute supply crises.''
   Concern has grown that the Soviet Union could face serious
shortages of food and other essentials this winter, causing extreme
hardship and possibly provoking civil unrest.
   European Commission President Jacques Delors earlier this week
said the fear of famine in the Soviet Union is one of the European
Community's biggest concerns. A European source said it will be one
of the main topics at an EC summit in Rome on Dec. 13-14.
   In Oxford, England, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced
Thursday that Britain will provide $39 million worth of expertise
to the Soviet Union over the next two years.
   He said help would be given in the areas of food distribution
and agriculture, energy, small business formation, and financial
services.
   The Foreign Office also said a similar fund for Eastern Europe
will be doubled to $58.5 million in fiscal 1991-2.
   U.S. officials said they are considering using U.S. emergency
disaster programs to help the Soviets, airlifting food and
medicine, and dispatching technicians to help solve transportation
problems. There is no decision yet to go ahead, the officials
stressed.
   President Bush is expected to discuss the situation with
Gorbachev next week during a 34-nation summit meeting in Paris.
   The U.S. officials said their plans for emergency aid were
prompted in large measure by fear that internal strife may escalate
in the Soviet Union. ``It's a tense moment, and it's anyone's guess
whether there is going to be some out-and-out confrontation,'' one
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Kohl also said Germany would send a group of high-ranking
experts to advise the Soviets during the transition from a
centrally planned socialist economy to a free-market system.
   He noted that Germany has already pledged $19.5 billion in
assistance to the Soviet Union.
   Kohl added that Eastern Europe cold also face severe shortages
this winter, and urged wealthy industrial states to be ready to
help out. He said he would raise the subject of aid during a
meeting Sunday with Bush in Oggersheim, in southwest Germany.
   ``I will discuss with President Bush how the Western industrial
lands can effectively and jointly support the reform processes (in
Eastern Europe), especially in view of the severe winter,'' he
said.
   Kohl also appealed to residents of what used to be East Germany
to be patient with the large number of Soviet troops still deployed
there. Under an agreement last summer that cleared the way for
German unification, the troops are to stay until 1994.
   ``We want the Soviet soldiers and their families to feel good
during their remaining time here,'' Kohl said.
   Intolerance has been growing toward the Red Army troops amid
reports of rising crime and desertion among the Soviet soldiers.
   During the debate on the gulf crisis, members of the governing
coalition urged greater support for the U.S. position on ending the
conflict.
   ``Has one so quickly forgotten the solidarity the United States
showed toward German unity?'' asked Michaela Geiger, a member of
the Christian Social Union, the conservative Bavarian sister-party
of Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   The opposition Social Democrats, led by former chancellor Willy
Brandt, proposed a resolution calling for maintaining international
political and economic pressure on Iraq, but disavowing any use of
force. The proposal was sent to committee for study.

<HEAD>Bears Can Be Saved Despite `Public Relations Problem,' Official
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's dwindling grizzly bear population
suffers from ``a public relations problem'' but can be saved from
extinction by concerted federal and state efforts, a government
bear expert said Thursday.
   ``Certainly we can do it,'' said Christopher Servheen,
coordinator of grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Timber and livestock groups have been cool to the recovery
program, he said, largely because ``grizzly bears have a public
relations problem - they are big, they are dangerous and they are
direct competitors with man.''
   But Servheen, of Missoula, Mont., told reporters after a meeting
designed to gather public comment on the recovery program that the
criticism will not block efforts to save the bears.
   The grizzlies went on the endangered species list in 1975 and
the government is required to fight to save them.
   ``There's no question that we are going to recover bears,'' he
said. ``What we're interested in now is public comment on how we
plan to do that.''
   The grizzly bear - Ursus arctos horribilis - once roamed western
North America from the Arctic Circle into northern Mexico. The U.S.
population was once estimated at 50,000 to 100,000.
   But the number of grizzlies in the United States has shrunk
drastically. Fewer than 1,000 remain.
   The main reason for the decline, according to federal officials,
is the shooting of bears for furs, sport, predator control and
fear. Another is loss of habitat to farming, grazing, human
settlements and water projects.
   The government has no intention of placing bears in areas where
they don't live now, Servheen said.
   Grizzlies live in Yellowstone, the Northern Continental Divide
area of Montana, the Cabinet-Yaak area of Montana, the Selkirks
vicinity of Idaho and Washington and the Northern Cascades area of
Washington. Bears also might be living in the Bitterroot Mountains
of Idaho and the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, but none has been
sighted lately.
   One female was recently brought into the Yellowstone area where
scientists are concerned about expanding the genetic pool, Servheen
said, adding that the service would like to take in three more.
   The service plans to keep gathering public comment on its plan
until February and produce a final version next spring. It will
decide then whether to start full-scale recovery operations in the
North Cascades and Bitterroot vicinities and whether to consider
such action in the San Juan Mountains.
   The 151-page plan envisions differing specific goals for each of
the ecosystems involved.
   In Yellowstone, for example, the objectives are 15 females with
cubs over a six-year average with the animals spread out over 15 of
the 18 ``bear management units'' and annual known bear deaths not
to exceed a total of seven or two adult females.
   Grizzlies are one of three types of bears found on this
continent. The others are the North American black bear and the
polar bear. Kodiak bears, close relatives of grizzlies, are found
on three islands off Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Former Contra rebels exchanged gunfire
with police and holed up in churches in several towns Thursday in a
fast-rising wave of violence that has left four police officers
dead and 23 people wounded.
   Police in Managua arrested a former Contra leader believed to be
involved in directing the violent rebellion that began Oct. 31 in
southeastern Nicaragua.
   Aristides Sanchez Herdocia, a right-wing hard-liner, was
political adviser to the now-disbanded, U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
resistance and a former member of its directorate.
   An Interior Ministry spokeswoman who demanded anonymity said
police who raided Sanchez's office early Thursday found ``a great
quantity of weapons and hand grenades'' and had other evidence
``involving him in the commission of grave crimes.''
   The casualties occurred late Wednesday in Sebaco, 50 miles north
of Managua, during a shootout between ex-Contra rebels and police.
It was the most violent incident yet in a series of protests that
appeared to be converging on the capital.
   Camouflaged army units with machine guns and rocket launchers
were called in late Wednesday to rout the rebels. It was the first
time the Sandinista People's Army has been deployed to try to quell
the two-week protest.
   The demobilized rebels, their supporters and the mayors of 16
towns in the region are demanding aid and land promised to the
former Contras as part of their agreement to lay down arms after a
decade of war against the former Sandinista government.
   They are also demanding that President Violeta Chamorro, who
defeated the Sandinistas in a February election, fire her
Sandinista army chief and two ministers.
   Mrs. Chamorro and Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado maintained
this week that there were ``dark forces'' manipulating the rebels
for political purposes. This was a veiled reference to Mrs.
Chamorro's vice president, Virgilio Godoy.
   Godoy, whose relations with Mrs. Chamorro have been severely
strained, has denied any behind-the-scenes involvement in what he
called ``a beautiful civic protest.''
   The government said Wednesday it had already distributed land to
most of the 20,000 Contras, who completed their demobilization in
late June.
   Sebaco is an important junction connecting large towns in
northeastern Nicaragua with the Panamerican highway, the most
important north-south artery in Central America.
   Regional police chief Sergio Gomez said the violence in Sebaco
began after about 300 rebel protesters placed boulders and trash
across the Panamerican Highway late Wednesday.
   He said police tried for more than three hours to persuade the
former rebels to clear the road. An Interior Ministry communique
said the talks were conducted in the presence of representatives of
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and the Organization of American
States' regional mission.
   Gomez said police began throwing tear gas at the blockade when
the negotiations failed. The protesters responded by throwing two
hand grenades and then opened fire with combat weapons.
   Four police officers were killed and 16 wounded in the ensuing
shootout. Seven civilians also were wounded, Gomez said.
   He said an undetermined number of the former rebels fled west of
the town and army units were called in. The 200 soldiers gained
control of the town Thursday, while additional army units chased
the rebels through the brush.
   An army intelligence source said an estimated 500 former Contras
had also gathered in the area around Waslala, a town in northern
Nicaragua near the Honduran border.
   Also Thursday, radio stations reported that demobilized Contras
were holed up in a church and the city hall building in Granada,
Nicaragua's second-largest city, 30 miles southeast of Managua.
   Another group had taken over a church, telephone building, bank
and other public offices in Nagarote, 30 miles northwest of
Managua.

Principles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops on Thursday told President Bush that a military
offensive against Iraq at this point could violate the church's
``just war'' standards.
   In a letter delivered to the White House, Archbishop Daniel E.
Pilarczyk of Cincinnati wrote:
   ``Because of the serious moral and human factors involved, we
ask you ... to intensify the determined and creative pursuit of a
peaceful solution that seeks to bring justice to the region without
resort to war.''
   The letter was dispatched after a closed-door discussion of
issue at the annual meeting of U.S. bishops here.
   Citing the church's age-old criteria of ``just war'' - that its
probable gains outweigh the resulting costs in lives, that civilian
areas not be targeted, and that war be a last resort - Pilarczyk
said:
   ``I fear that, in this situation, moving beyond the deployment
of military forces in an effort to deter Iraqi aggression to the
undertaking of offensive military action could well violate these
criteria, especially the principles of proportionality and last
resort.''
   Repeating earlier condemnation by the annual meeting of bishops
here of Iraq's aggression, hostage-taking and violation of human
rights and support for peaceful pressure on Iraq, Pilarczyk wrote:
   ``We urge our government and our allies to continue to pursue
the course of peaceful pressure and not to resort to war.''
   He said that considering the ``dangers and human costs which
could be the result of war in the Persian Gulf'' the nation ``needs
to continue to assess and discuss the ethical dimensions of this
difficult situation.''

   Evan Cattanach's job with a whisky
maker in the Scottish Highlands is nothing to sniff at.
   A $1 million insurance policy his employer took out on him
during a U.S. visit is proof of his value as a ``noser'' - the man
who ensures quality control by sniffing batches of the liquor.
   Cardhu is a small distillery, but the 166-year-old company
produces more than 1 million bottles of its single-malt alcohol a
year.
   Laboratory testing can determine a liquor's content, but it is
Cattanach's nose that determines whether each twice-monthly batch
of Cardhu will be saved for 12-year aging.
   ``You can do tests. But the brain tells you it's Cardhu,'' said
Cattanach, 55. ``I put a few drops on my hands. The alcohol
evaporates when I rub my hands together. It leaves behind the
subtle character flavor - the maltiness and earthiness.''
   Worldwide, about 150 people have jobs like Cattanach's.
   Cardhu took out the Lloyd's of London policy on Cattanach's nose
for his two-week American trip, scheduled to end next week with a
tour of a Kentucky distillery.
   During a visit to Los Angeles, Cattanach found Cardhu's
$25-a-bottle whisky served at a barbecue rib eatery. But to his
dismay, he said diners were ``sloshing ice in everything.''

   Palestinians celebrated the second anniversary
of their declaration of independence with fireworks and parades
Thursday, spurning Israeli efforts to squelch festivities.
   Most clashes between police and demonstrators were minor. A
4-year-old Palestinian boy was killed when struck in the head by a
stone, apparently thrown by Arabs, the army and Arab reports said.
   The army reinforced patrols and imposed curfews on all of the
occupied Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank, confining more than
1 million Palestinians to their homes. The areas were closed to
journalists.
   Israeli troops were drawn into cat-and-mouse chases with
Palestinian youths who held military-style parades, unfurled
outlawed Palestinian flags and distributed sweets to children in a
traditional gesture.
   After darkness fell, the bangs of firecrackers were heard in
Jerusalem and dozens of villages and refugee camps. Palestinians
lighted torches and released balloons from their roofs.
   A half-dozen minor skirmishes were reported in Jerusalem between
Palestinians and police. Several ended in showers of police tear
gas and rubber bullets.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said three
Palestinians were caught with bullhorns in the city ress Writer&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) - Best-selling author Bret Easton Ellis blasted
Simon &amp; Schuster on Thursday for the publisher's 11th-hour decision
to ax his new novel about a serial killer who mutilates women,
saying it smacks of censorship.
   ``If all this had been brought up 11 months ago, I would not say
that,'' Ellis said. ``But when it comes this late in the game and
it seems that it was done just because Marvin Davis does not
respond to this kind of fiction, then it is censorship.''
   Ellis was referring to the head of Paramount Communications
Inc., Simon &amp; Schuster's parent company. The publishing house
announced Wednesday it would not print Ellis' third novel,
``American Psycho.''
   Simon &amp; Schuster spokeswoman Barbara Reno said the company would
not comment on Ellis' charges.
   Chairman Richard E. Snyder told The Washington Post he was not
pressured by Paramount. He said he learned of the violent contents
of the book only recently and said editors who bought it made ``an
incorrect decision.''
   ``It was I who decided we should not put our name on this book.
It's a matter of taste,'' Snyder said. He said Paramount agreed
with his decision.
   ``I think it would have been a matter of taste if this had been
raised or discussed 12 months ago when the final draft was first
handed in, not after jackets were printed up, the book typeset, 250
bound galleys made,'' said Ellis, whose previous novels, ``Less
Than Zero'' and ``The Rules of Attraction,'' were also published by
Simon &amp; Schuster.
   ``American Psycho'' had a January publication date and was
scheduled to be shipped to stores next month.
   Ellis' book, which includes graphic passages of women being
dismembered and cannibalized, was criticized recently in Spy and
Time magazines.
   ``My response to both those pieces was that they verged on the
hysterical, mostly because the reviewers concentrated on 40 or less
pages of a 400-page novel, concentrating on 10 percent of the book
while ignoring the other 90.''
   ``I think it distorted what the book is really about and in some
strange way gave the impression that I was endorsing this kind of
violence, which if you read the book is clearly not the case,''
said the 26-year-old author.
   Ellis said Simon &amp; Schuster's action means the end of their
relationship. ``It's kind of sad. I've been with them since 1984
and I'm very close friends with my editor there. But I don't think
there is any chance I would ever publish another book there
again.''
   Ellis' publicist, Amanda Urban, said she is negotiating with
several other publishers who expressed interest in the book. She
would not elaborate.
   Urban said Ellis gets to keep his advance. A source involved
with the contract, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
advance was $300,000.

   Unseasonably warm weather expanded across the central United
States on Thursday with record highs from Colorado to northern
Michigan. Rain and snow were scattered over the Northwest.
   In more typical November weather, a storm was headed for Alaska.
Heavy rain fell on parts of the Hawaiian Islands.
   Temperatures reached as high as the 80s in the Plains and the
Midwest.
   A reading of 78 degrees in North Platte, Neb., tied a record on
the books since 1887. Pueblo, Colo., tied a record high of 80
degrees that has stood since 1894. The 61-degree reading in Sault
Ste. Marie, Mich., toppled a record set in 1918, the National
Weather Service said.
   Other record highs were: 63, Alpena, Mich.; 75, Colorado
Springs, Colo.; 69, a tie, Dubuque, Iowa; 53, Duluth, Minn.; 65,
Eau Claire, Wis.; 69, Flint, Mich.; 68, tie, Grand Rapids, Mich.;
64, Green Bay, Wis.; 67, tie, Jackson, Mich.; 69, La Crosse, Wis.;
68, Lansing, Mich.; 68, Madison, Wis.; 69, tie, Milwaukee, Wis.;
72, tie, Moline, Ill.; 69, tie, Rockford, Ill.; 70, tie, South
Bend, Ind.; and 65, tie, Traverse City, Mich.
   ``It's wonderful. It's the kind of weather I'd take all the time
if they'd give it to me,'' said Deann Beard, who barbecued hot dogs
with her daughter at Boom Island Park in Minneapolis, which had a
record high Wednesday of 71.
   The normal Nov. 14 temperature in Minneapolis is 42. Ten days
before the record high the city had 3 inches of snow.
   ``We've had multiple Indian summers,'' weather service
meteorologist Jim Mathews said in Minneapolis. ``If you had told me
in October that we'd have 70s in November, I'd have said you were
crazy.''
   Rain was scattered over southwestern North Dakota at midday and
over the northern coast of Washington state. Snow showers were
scattered over the Montana Rockies.
   Strong, gusty wind blew across Wyoming between Cheyenne and
Laramie during the morning. During the afternoon, high wind blew
across parts of Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Indiana. Wind gusted to
nearly 50 mph at Emporia, Kan., around midday.
   A winter storm watch was posted through Friday across sections
of northern and interior Alaska, with blizzard conditions expected
over the western Arctic Coast.
   Locally heavy rain caused minor flooding in the islands of
Hawaii after more than 8 inches of rain fell in 24 hours at
Mountainview and other locations near Hilo.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 in Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 29
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 86 at Harlingen,
Texas.

   A former Florida Ku Klux Klan
leader sought in his home state for the sexual battery of a
16-year-old girl has been arrested for panhandling in Canada,
authorities said.
   Donald Spivey was arrested Wednesday in the community of Spences
Bridge, about 120 miles northeast of Vancouver, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said. A Canadian immigration adjudicator scheduled a
closed hearing Friday to determine whether Spivey should be
deported to the United States for entering Canada illegally, said
Rob Johnston, Vancouver-area immigration manager.
   Spivey allegedly used the name William O'Shea when he entered
Canada on Oct. 24 at Osoyoos, about 160 miles east of Vancouver,
said Spences Bridge Constable Ray Watson.
   Watson said that when he checked Spivey's fingerprints with the
FBI, he learned he was wanted in Florida.
   Spivey, 41, recently was Grand Dragon of a Florida KKK group,
said Lynne Breidenbach, a spokeswoman for the Polk County sheriff's
office in Lakeland, Fla.
   A warrant for Spivey's arrest was issued April 18, charging him
with sexual battery, she said. The warrant set bail at $500,000.

<HEAD>USDA Considering Change In Milk Pricing Formula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to change the butterfat formula
used in determining milk prices paid to farmers is under
consideration, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said the proposed change is based on the
unanimous wishes of major sectors of the dairy industry that
testified a national hearing on July 31 in Alexandria, Va.
   The proposal, if adopted, would reduce the value of butterfat in
the pricing formula used under all federal milk marketing orders.
   ``Paying dairy farmers less for the butterfat in the milk they
sell to processors will recognize the lowered value of butterfat in
today's marketplace caused by consumers' changing preferences,''
Haley said.
   Currently, butterfat in milk is given a value according to a
``butterfat differential'' based on a fat content of 3.5 percent.
Milk with a higher percentage of butterfat gets a higher prices,
and milk with a lower percentage gets a lower price.
   The differentials are gauged in increments of one-tenth of 1
percent.
   Haley said the new formula would benefit milk wholesalers, or
``handlers,'' under federal milk marketing orders. The handlers now
are paying farmers one price for the butterfat in their milk but
can only sell surplus butterfat to butter plants at a lower price.
   Under the new formula, handlers would pay less for the
butterfat, but would increase the value of skim milk. Haley said
the overall net income to dairy farmers will remain the same.
   But use of the new formula is contingent on milk producers
approving the plan, he said. Producer approval will be determined
through six federal marketing order referendums.
   The federal marketing orders are a system used to set minimum
prices for milk that dealers must pay farmers. Although the orders
do not set retail milk prices, the minimums specified at the farm
are felt throughout the marketing chain.
   Officials said details of the proposed pricing formula will be
published in the Federal Register, the government's rule-making
document, on Nov. 19.
   The agency said copies of the proposal are available from any
federal milk marketing order office or from: AMS, USDA, Dairy
Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, D.C. 20090-6456. Telephone 202 447-6273.

<HEAD>Inquiry Told that Soviet Bloc Knew of Secret Network</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian official told a parliamentary inquiry on
Thursday that the Soviet bloc learned years ago about a network of
secret resistance groups in Europe reportedly set up with NATO and
CIA aid.
   The Western public is only learning now about the anti-communist
network.
   Adm. Fulvio Martini, chief of military intelligence service,
testified on the opening day of the inquiry that the other side
found out about the operation through its own spies.
   ``They surely knew about Gladio for a simple reason, because of
an espionage operation that had a certain importance in a NATO
country,'' Martini said, without going into specifics.
   Martini is in charge of Operation Gladio, the Italian branch of
the guerrilla network established at the dawn of the Cold War in
case of a Soviet invasion. Gladio is Italian for the double-edged
swords used by Roman gladiators.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti revealed the existance of the group
last month, many European governments have admitted similar
organizations were formed in their countries - sometimes with CIA
help. Several groups were later put under North Atlantic Treaty
Organization command.
   The Parliamentary Committee on Massacres is examining whether
Operation Gladio was linked to right-wing terrorism. Martini
strongly denied that it was. The admiral did not say exactly when
the Soviets learned about the guerrilla network.
   He told the commission that Warsaw Pact members themselves had a
form of Operation Gladio. He identified it as Spetnas - an acronym
for Spetsialnovo Naznacheniye, or special forces.
   But he said that unlike Gladio, it relied not on civilians but
on military forces who could form ``a kind of Fifth Column'' in
case of Western invasion.
   In Poland, Deputy Defense Minister Janusz Onyskiewicz said that
``we did not prepare for a guerrilla fight in case of invasion by
our country by the NATO army.'' He is a civilian appointed by the
post-Communist government.
   Revelation of the European networks has prompted an outcry in
Italy.
   Some politicians and news media speculated Gladio may have been
behind a series of unresolved terrorist bombings that occurred from
1969 through the early 1980s, when the Italian Communists came to
the brink of power. Most of the attacks were blamed on right-wing
groups.
   Martini admitted under questioning that Gladio documents
mentioned defending against ``internal subversion'' as well as
foreign invasion.
   But he denied any ``gladiators'' were involved in illegal
conspiracies.
   ``The structure and national breakdown of Gladio ... would be of
very little use for a coup or other internal subversion,'' he said.
   Of a total of 622 ``gladiators,'' 70 percent were based above
the Po River near Italy's northern borders, he said.
   ``Not one of the 622 was ever involved in any conspiracies or
plots,'' he said.
   He said Operation Gladio was ``frozen'' a month ago on
Andreotti's orders, but that authorities had let it decline for
years because of the reduced Soviet threat.
   Some members were apparently being recruited even in recent
years, however. The Italian newsweekly Europeo on Thursday
published what it said was a partial list of Gladio members. Among
them were a 22-year-old and a 23-year-old.
   Members of the commission said they were told the list was
genuine.
   In Britain, The Guardian newspaper quoted Gen. Sir Anthony
Farrar-Hockley, a former commander of NATO forces in northern
Europe, as saying a British group was formed to resist an invasion
by Communist forces.
   ``The original plan was to establish a network to arm guerrillas
from the civil populace while conventional forces were occupied
elsewhere,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The network is said to also have had branches in Germany,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Spain,
Greece and Portugal.
   In Italy, the resistance group was set up through a 1956 accord
between Italian secret services and the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency, Martini and parliamentary deputies said Thursday. It came
under NATO coordination three years later.
   Among questions raised by Gladio is what happened to some of its
139 arms caches hidden around Italy. Martini said the contents of
two of them were stolen.
   The hearing Thursday was closed to the public but reporters were
allowed to follow the proceedings on closed-circuit television.
   The broadcast was interrupted five times when the commission
decided that certain testimony involved state secrets.

   A leak of noxious sulfur dioxide
Thursday forced the evacuation of 1,500 McDonnell Douglas workers
and sent 40 people to the hospital with minor breathing problems,
officials said.
   The chemical, which can burn the eyes and throat, started
leaking at 9:45 a.m. from the valve of a 150-gallon drum between
two buildings at the sprawling aerospace plant, said fire spokesman
Hank Zavaleta.
   Firefighters evacuated people from the buildings while a
hazardous materials team cleaned up the area.
   Forty workers were taken to hospitals for observation or
treatment of minor inhalation problems, said McDonnell Douglas
spokesman Warren Lamb. There were no serious injuries.
   The leak's cause was not immediately known. The sulfur dioxide
was used to treat wastewater from metal finishing to make the water
safe enough to dispose.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The private group Public Citizen on Thursday
issued what it described as a clarification of a recent critical
report on the insurance industry, saying it did not mean to imply
that the American International Group was in danger of insolvency.
   In a letter to AIG Chairman Maurice R. Greenberg, Public Citizen
President Joan Claybrook also reiterated that Public Citizen finds
no need for policyholders to switch companies because of the
findings in its report.
   AIG released the letter, along with a statement describing the
Public Citizen report as ``irresponsible'' and objecting to ``any
suggestion ... that its financial condition was to any degree
imperiled or impaired.'' It said the consumer group had
``acknowledged ... that any such suggestion in the report was
neither intended nor accurate.''
   Public Citizen has previously acknowledged that it was mistaken
in saying in the report that the property and casualty surpluses of
Aetna and the ITT Hartford insurance group had declined.
   Public Citizen spokesman Bob Dreyfuss said the letter to AIG,
however, did not acknowledge any error.
   ``We didn't make any additional changes or corrections or
retractions at all in the report,'' he said. ``It was really a
simple clarification.''
   The report, issued on Oct. 15, said that five of the nation's
top 20 property and casualty companies would be subject to possible
insolvency in the event of a severe economic downturn.
   It said none of the companies was on the edge of insolvency but
``the underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly
evident.''
   The five were Aetna, AIG, Hartford, Liberty Mutual and United
States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty. The study said they each triggered four
of six factors that, by Public Citizen's analysis, would make them
vulnerable to insolvency in an economic downturn.
   One of the tests was whether they held less in surplus in 1982
than in 1972. Aetna and Hartford were both listed in this category,
but the group said a later re-calculation showed that their
surpluses had actually increased during the decade. Consequently,
it said, they should not have been on the list.
   In response to a question at a news conference when the report
was released, Ms. Claybrook said she would not advise people
holding policies with any of the companies to change to another
insurer. Instead, she said, they should write to their companies
and urge corrective action.
   In her letter to Greenberg, Ms. Claybrook said, ``AIG has
objected to references to it in the report. Public Citizen did not
suggest, or intend to imply, that AIG's financial condition is such
that it is in danger of becoming insolvent, nor did we intend to
cast doubt upon AIG's ability to meet its obligations. As Public
Citizen explicitly stated when the report was released, it finds no
need for policyholders to switch companies and does not dispute the
ratings that AIG has received from Moody's, Standard and Poor's and
A.M. Best.''
   AIG's statement said it had previously received and still holds
the highest rating provided by each of these organizations.

<HEAD>Report: Alcohol, Tobacco Firms Should Pay for Counter Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should require the alcohol and
tobacco industries to pay for advertising to discourage teenage use
of the ``gateway'' substances, a national panel said Thursday.
   The National Commission on Drug-Free Schools said the campaign
is needed because, while schoolchildren have curbed their use of
cocaine, marijuana and other illegal drugs, they stubbornly resist
calls to abstain from drinking and smoking.
   The panel suggested in a report that Congress enact a ban on
advertising and promotion of either or both of these products if
the industries fail to stop targeting youth by 1992.
   The report presents final conclusions of the 26-member
commission, co-chaired by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and
William Bennett, the outgoing director of the National Drug Control
Policy, on the problems of drugs in the nation's school.
   The key finding, after nationwide field hearings involving more
than 1,700 witnesses, was that while prevention efforts have had
some impact on the use of illegal controlled drugs, there has not
been the same success in discouraging use of alcohol and tobacco.
   ``For the past year, our commission has talked to hundreds of
students, teachers, and prevention specialists, and all of them
agree that alcohol is the drug of choice for young people,'' said
Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, a commission member.
   ``Most of the kids don't realized that alcohol and tobacco are
often gateways to other drug use,'' he added.
   The report, authorized as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1988, said illegal drug use decreased from 1981, when 66 percent of
seniors acknowledged use of an illicit drug, to a 51 percent rate
in 1989.
   Marijuana use within the previous 30 days among high school
seniors declined from 37 percent in 1978 to 17 percent in 1989.
Cocaine use within the previous 30 days among high school seniors
declined from a high of 6.7 percent in 1985 to a low of 2.8 percent
in 1989.
   Alcohol use within the previous 30 days among high school
seniors declined from 72 percent in 1978 to 60 percent in 1989. The
report said children as young as third-graders have used alcohol
and tobacco.
   Data from recent national surveys of high school seniors
indicate that about 19 percent reported having smoked cigarettes
and about 9 percent reported having drunk alcoholic beverages by
the sixth grade. About 3.3 percent of these students reported
having been drunk by the sixth grade.
   ``Alcohol and tobacco pose serious health hazards to young
people,'' said the report. ``Alcohol-related traffic accidents are
the leading cause of death among young people.''
   Among its recommendations, it said, ``the amount of funds from
the alcohol and tobacco industries should be sufficient to develop
and operate a substantial public education program to balance the
messages that have the effect of encouraging young people to drink
and smoke.''
   ``The counter-advertising campaigns could serve as remedial
education for young people who have been influenced to use these
drugs by exposure to advertising and promotion from these
industries over the years.''

   The network said the FBI agents had no warrant and acted over
the objections of a CNN attorney. It said it was demanding the
tapes be returned.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Scott Nelson confirmed authorities
obtained some CNN tapes without a subpoena.
   ``We were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for
analysis,'' Nelson said.
   The network said the Turner Security official called the FBI

   Sen.-elect Paul Wellstone has made it clear
that the Senate tradition of sidestepping personal attacks on
fellow senators will not affect his antagonism toward his new
colleague Jesse Helms.
   Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, said he has been
an opponent of the conservative North Carolina Republican since he
first heard Helms while studying at the University of North
Carolina in the 1960s.
   ``I have detested him since I was 19, and moreover I think he
won against Harvey Gantt on a blatantly racist campaign. Period.
It's true,'' Wellstone said at a news conference Thursday. Helms
won re-election last week by narrowly defeating Gantt, a black.
   ``I didn't come here to Washington to start talking differently
than I did in Minnesota.''
   Wellstone could be serving on at least one committee with Helms,
a possibility that Wellstone acknowledged would be ``interesting.''
   One of Wellstone's top priorities is a seat on the Agriculture
Committee. Helms is the panel's former chairman and now its No. 2
Republican.
   ``I think people in Minnesota expect me to come to the United
States Senate and every single time it's appropriate on the floor
of the Senate or wherever to take on Jesse Helms and present a very
different kind of vision of politics,'' Wellstone said.
   Helms, who has never met Wellstone, responded Thursday: ``I hope
that he will prove to be somewhat more stable. ... Otherwise he's
going to have a difficult time in the Senate.''
   Helms bristled at Wellstone remarks that Helms had ``minimized''
the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. ``He went off the
deep end,'' Helms said of Wellstone.

   Opponents of the Iroquois gas pipeline said
Thursday they will appeal a federal agency's decision to approve
the 370-mile pipeline.
   At least four groups planned to challenge the project by
questioning the procedures used by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
   The commission's approval cleared the way for construction to
begin on the $583 million pipeline from upstate New York, through
western Connecticut and under Long Island Sound to Long Island.
   The line will bring Canadian natural gas to utilities and gas
companies in New England, New York and New Jersey.
   Backers of the project say it will reduce dependence on Mideast
oil and provide a clean-burning energy alternative for heating and
electricity.
   Leading the opposition are domestic gas and oil prospectors and
suppliers who say the project has been given an unfair competitive
advantage over U.S. energy sources.
   A citizens' group opposes the decision on environmental grounds
and because of the disruption it may cause to property owners in
its path.

   Warplanes of the West African task
force in Liberia bombed the rebel-held port of Buchanan, and the
insurgents said people were killed.
   Rebels also claimed the Nigerian jets destroyed an American ship
carrying relief food in Wednesday's attack, but State Department
officials in Washington denied it.
   The officials said Thursday that one of two U.S.-owned Liberian
flag vessels at Buchanan sustained minor damage to a foremast. The
other was not damaged.
   The State Department said there reportedly were two Liberian
casualties, but gave no details. It said no American citizens were
involved.
   The U.S. government expressed its concern about the incident to
task force headquarters in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, the
officials said.
   The task force was sent to enforce peace in Liberia.
   The U.S. Catholic Relief Services and the Belgian branch of
Doctors without Borders are among the humanitarian organizations
that have been striving throughout Liberia to help people dying of
starvation, disease andin task force bombing raids.
   Joshua Iroha, the Nigerian ambassador ande chief political
representative of the five-nation West African army in Liberia,
said Wednesday's air raid was aimed at stopping weapons being
shipped to rebels led by Charles Taylor.
   Iroha said in an interview at his base in Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone, that the task force ``is not obliged to tell
anyone when it is carrying out military operations, and whoever was
at the port of Buchanan when the bombing was carried out was just
unlucky.
   ``There are more weapons in the containers at the port of
Buchanan than food ... Any international relief organization that
wants to help Liberians must use the free port of Monrovia.''
   The West Africans have forced Taylor's rebels from the capital,
where 150,000 to 200,000 civilians remain. Most people in Liberia
are behind the lines of Taylor's guerrillas. After Monrovia,
Buchanan has the largest concentration of civilians.
   About 10,000 civilians have been killed since rebels invaded
from Ivory Coast on Dec. 23. More than half of Liberia's 2.3
million people have fled the country or have been displaced inside
Liberia.

   Panel Opens `Keating Five' Hearing, Told Senators Helped S&amp;L Owner

<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee opened trial-like
public hearings Thursday on the ``Keating Five'' with the panel's
lawyer declaring the lawmakers helped the owner of a failing
savings and loan fight an ``all-out war'' with federal regulators.
   The senators also heard committee chairman Howell Heflin say
many Americans believe ``that you were bribed, that you sold your
office, that you traded your honor and your good names for
contributions and other benefits.''
   Special counsel Robert S. Bennett, said in his opening statement
that Sens. Alan Cranston and Dennis DeConcini ``were important
players'' in Charles J. Keating Jr.'s strategy to stave off federal
rules and that Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. ``played a much greater
role'' than he now contends.
   Speaking in a packed hearing room, Bennett said Sens. John
McCain and John Glenn played lesser roles. The lawyer spoke for
about five hours Thursday, and will resume Friday morning.
   Before Bennett spoke, the chairman of the six-senator committee,
Alabama Democrat Heflin, somberly told the subjects of the inquiry:
``Many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your services
were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that you sold
your office, that you traded your honor and your good names for
contributions and other benefits.''
   Keating contributed $1.3 million to campaigns of, and causes
favored by, the five senators.
   While Bennett denied his role was prosecutorial, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark. testily told him, ``You're beginning to reach
personal conclusions and deciding what is relevant and what is not
relevant.''
   Bennett responded ``It's less my conclusion and more the
objective evidence.''
   In his detailed comments, Bennett told the panel:
   -Despite Riegle's statements that he doesn't remember such
events, Keating offered to host a fund-raiser for Riegle at the
businessman's Detroit hotel; the senator set arrangements in motion
for an April 2, 1987, meeting between the four other senators and
the former top thrift regulator, and Riegle hid from his own aides
his role in arranging that meeting and the fund-raising purpose o
a trip to Keating's Phoenix-based company.
   -Cranston continued to contact federal regulators even though
former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt told the senator that Keating was
``a crook.''
   -Evidence shows that DeConcini offered a deal on behalf of
Keating to former top thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray, despite
DeConcini's denial of a quid pro quo. Three other senators at the
meeting refused to ``say flatly'' that DeConcini's version was
correct.
   -On Glenn, the lawyer ``knew of no evidence'' linking Keating's
contributions to intervention by the Ohio senator.
   -Glenn arranged and attended a lunch between Keating and
then-House Speaker Jim Wright in January 1988 to discuss S&amp;L
problems. Some time after the meeting, a Keating aide sent Glenn a
thank you note, saying ``Speaker Wright's interest was fantastic.''
   -On McCain: ``Was there anything improper about Sen. McCain's
conduct? The evidence discovered by the special counsel suggests
not.''
   Four of the five senators were present for the opening of the
hearing in the Senate Hart Office Building. Cranston, who said last
week that he will undergo treatment for prostate cancer, was not
there.
   The committee could vote to rebuke any of the five or to
recommend a more serious punishment to the full Senate, or to take
no action against any of them. All have denied wrongdoing.
   While Keating was enlisting the five senators and other
lawmakers as soldiers in his battle, he was liberally doling out
political contributions, Bennett said. It is the committee's role,
he said, to determine whether that money was driving the senators
to intervene with regulators on Keating's behalf - or whether they
were providing normal constituent service.
   Bennett said, ``I will give you many instances where acts and
money were discussed at the same time and indeed hundreds of
thousands of dollars in the case of Sen. Cranston passed in an
office in this building.''
   The lawyer held up jumbled pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and
promised to piece together evidence in the case just as someone
would complete the puzzle.
   The committee members and Bennett repeatedly described the
hearings as a fact-finding effort to determine whether the five
senators helped Keating because of the $1.3 million they received
from the former thrift operator and his associates.
   All five senators have contended they were helping Keating as
they would anyone - whether a contributor or not - who complained
of unfair treatment by federal regulators.
   For months, the news media have reported that Bennett
recommended to the committee of three Democrats and three
Republicans that McCain, R-Ariz. and Glenn, D-Ohio, be dismissed
from the case; and that the investigation be intensified against
Cranston, D-Calif., DeConcini, D-Ariz. and Riegle, D-Mich.
   In the mid-1980s, when Keating was fighting a rule by regulators
limiting risky thrift investments, he enlisted the support of the
five senators and many others.
   Placing his hand on stacks of documents Bennett said, ``It is
clear from the paper and testimony that Cranston and DeConcini were
important players in Keating's strategy.''
   Riegle, Bennett said, told the committee he played a ``minor and
largely passive'' role in helping Keating fight the regulators. But
he said there was ``substantial evidence Riegle played a much
greater role than he now recalls.''
   Bennett said McCain and Glenn did not play such large roles in
organizing the meetings with regulators in April 1987, ``nor did
they play meaningful roles following the meetings.''
   Bennett also appeared to back previous statements by Gray, the
former chief thrift regulator, that the senators had offered Gray a
dealon behalf of Keating.
   ``The regulators were asked to withdraw a regulation (limiting
risky investments by thrifts) at the request of a single company
and the company would do certain things in return,'' Bennett said.
   Gray has testified an offer was made at the April 2, 1987,
meeting he held with all of the senators except Riegle. According
to Gray, DeConcini made the offer, but DeConcini, Cranston, McCain
and Glenn all denied such a quid pro quo was offered.

<TEXT>
   Former President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua
held talks with Saddam Hussein on Third World revolutionary efforts
to resist U.S. influence, Baghdad television said Thursday.
   The Iraqi leader said his seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2 was a
victory for all Third World countries because it was important to
show that ``arrogant powers cannot violate small nations,'' the
television quoted him as saying. It did not elaborate.
   Ortega, who headed Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
administration, said he flew to Baghdad on Wednesday to express
solidarity with Hussein and the Iraqi people, according to the
report.
   It said the two men had a ``profound discussion'' covering the
problems of liberation movements in Third World countries trying to
combat U.S. hegemony.
   Saddam expressed his desire to settle the Persian Gulf crisis
through dialogue and in conjunction with other regional disputes,
especially the Arab-Israeli conflict. The United States and many
other nations opposing Iraq reject the linkage.
   Ortega was quoted as telling Saddam that the struggle for
freedom and independence in Latin America would continue, despite
changes in the international climate.
   The United States supported the Contra rebels who fought
Ortega's government in the 1980s. Ortega was defeated in February
elections by a U.S.-backed coalition.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities said Thursday
they had smashed a 30-member cocaine-smuggling ring whose leader
buried $43 million in drug money on a farm in Puerto Rico.
   The case caused a sensation last spring when it was disclosed
that residents of the Vega Baja coastal area had unearthed barrels
filled with $10, $20 and $100 bills and kept their windfall secret
for weeks.
   In all, residents made off with $11 million, which they put in
their bank accounts and bought everything from VCRs to luxury homes
before the authorities stepped in, according to the FBI.
   In a statement Thursday, the FBI said it had arrested or issued
warrants for 30 alleged members of the drug ring that amassed the
buried treasure in drug-running operations from Colombia since
1985.
   Fifteen suspects were charged Thursday in U.S. District Court in
San Juan and four others were already in jails in Puerto Rico and
New York, said FBI spokeswoman Juana Arriazola.
   Another suspect arrested Thursday in New York was awaiting
extradition, and two others were charged in Puerto Rico on
Wednesday, she said.
   Among the eight suspects still at large were reputed drug
kingpin Ramon Torres Gonzalez, on whose farm the cash-filled
barrels were hidden, and Iris Janet Concepcion Perez, alleged
co-leader of the drug ring, the FBI said.
   All 30 are accused under a 27-count federal indictment with
criminal enterprise and conspiracy to import and distribute
controlled substances. The indictment was returned Nov. 1 by a
federal grand jury in Puerto Rico.
   If convicted, the suspects face a minimum penalty of 60 years in
prison and a maximum sentence of life in prison, as well as a fine
of up to $10 million.
   U.S. Magistrate Jesus Castellano released seven of the
defendants who came into court Thursday on bail totaling $625,000
and jailed the others without bail. He set a court hearing for Nov.
21.
   The indictment alleges that Torres and his drug organization had
imported and distributed more than 4.5 tons of Colombian cocaine
into Puerto Rico and the United States since 1985.
   William Mitchell, head of the San Juan office of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration, said most of the cocaine was shipped to
Puerto Rico by way of neighboring Dominican Republic.
   ``Some (cocaine) was for the local market, but the majority went
to the states, principally New York and Philadelphia,'' he said.
   The drug ring amassed a fortune, of which $43 million in cash
was buried in 22 plastic drums on Torres' 9.7-acre farm in Vega
Baja, about 35 miles east of San Juan, authorities said.
   The FBI got involved in the case in April after authorities
learned that local residents had been using large amounts of cash
to buy houses, cars, VCRs, motorcycles, boats and jewelry.
   Residents took $11 million of the money before Torres allegedly
removed and hid the remaining $32 million, which has not been
found, the FBI said.
   The FBI said it had confiscated $4.5 million in cash and
property purchased with the stolen money. None of the residents
were arrested.

   Tens of thousands of Romanians rallied
against the government Thursday, turning an anniversary of the
first major protest against Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
into a denunciation of his successors.
   The rallies across Romania continued late Thursday night.
   They were sparked by the protest three years ago in this
southern Transylvanian town.
   But they were fueled by unrest over government reforms that have
tripled food prices, and by resentment over President Ion Iliescu's
having served as a Communist official years ago under Ceausescu.
   Demonstrators also took to the streets of the capital Bucharest,
Timisoara, Constanta, Ploiesti, Iasi and Sibiu, demanding Iliescu's
resignation.
   In Bucharest, up to 50,000 demonstrators converged on Palace
Square, where protesters died in last year's uprising, and marched
to government headquarters.
   The protesters, including many students, shouted anti-Iliescu
slogans and jeered the price increases. Thousands remained on the
streets Thursday night and about 300 demonstrators blocked traffic
on the main boulevard.
   More than 50,000 people rallied in the western city of
Timisoara, site of the massacre that spurred the revolution.
   The center of Ploiesti, 38 miles north of Bucharest, was also
blocked by demonstrators late Thursday night.
   But the focus of the rallies was Brasov, where thousands of
workers marched through the city center to commemorate the Nov. 15,
1987 riot against Ceausescu.
   Three years ago in Brasov, a man set himself afire on a hilltop
to protest Ceausescu's rule. Workers and others later attacked and
ransacked city hall. The dread Securitate secret police suppressed
the rallies.
   Scores of people accused of instigating the protests were
arrested, tortured and jailed.
   At Thursday's rally, former dissident Doina Cornea, among the
first to support the 1987 protests, joined crowds calling for
Iliescu's resignation.
   ``We do not need hypocritical, violent demagogues,'' Cornea told
demonstrators.
   Sorin Rosca said the newly established Civic Alliance opposition
group would organize committees nationwide to seek out remaining
Securitate agents and publish names.
   ``We are not dealing with the Communist phantom, but with a
neo-Communist reality,'' he told the crowd.
   Iliescu promised gradual reforms and social protection after he
won a landslide victory in May elections.
   But many Romanians accuse him and his National Salvation Front
government of allowing old-regime officials to remain in the
bureaucracy and of personally harboring Communist tendencies.
   Both president and government insist they have shed their
Communist past.

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher Vows to Stay on; Heseltine Says He Would Heal Rift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pledged Thursday
to stay on in office, while fellow Conservative Michael Heseltine,
the man who seeks to oust her, said he can unify their party's
``deep divide.''
   They traded campaign rhetoric on the day Heseltine formally
submitted his bid for leadership of the Conservative Party and the
government.
   Heseltine, once Mrs. Thatcher's defense secretary, will stand
against her in a ballot Tuesday of the 372 Conservative
legislators. It marks the first serious challenge to her leadership
since she took office 11 years ago.
   ``After three general election victories, leading the only party
with clear policies, resolutely carried out, I intend to
continue,'' she declared in the House of Commons.
   She was responding to an opposition lawmaker who held up a
5-year-old newspaper in which he said she'd promised to quit in
1990.
   Mrs. Thatcher also attacked a Heseltine proposal on education,
saying it would ``either mean a huge increase in income tax, or a
substantial reduction in monies available for other services.''
   Heseltine has suggested education should be paid for by the
national government, not through the unpopular new per-capita tax
on property dubbed the poll tax. He said Thursday he would review
the tax.
   The self-made millionaire said in an interview that he was
inspired to make his challenge by former Deputy Prime Minister
Geoffrey Howe's scathing attack on Mrs. Thatcher in the House of
Commons Tuesday.
   ``After Geoffrey made the speech, you couldn't say `Go on,
business as usual,''' Heseltine told Independent Television.
``There was a deep divide . ... We have to find a way of unifying
the party. ... I think I could do it.''
   He said that despite what Mrs. Thatcher achieved in the 1980s, a
growing number of people felt it was time to ``ask questions about
the 1990s, and it will need a new voice, a new language, a new
approach.''
   Earlier, he was heckled at a meeting of Conservative Party
workers in Paisley, Scotland, but by apparent outsiders, who
carried ``Socialist Worker'' placards.
   Heseltine snapped at them, ``You will never solve Scotland's
problems if your only contribution to the debate is a loud mouth
and an empty mind.''
   A poll of 240 Conservative lawmakers conducted Monday to
Thursday by Press Association, the British news agency, found
Heseltine facing a defeat. It reported Mrs. Thatcher winning 53.3
percent of the vote and Heseltine 19.2 percent. But 27.5 percent
refused to reveal where they stood.
   Heseltine needs 159 votes in the first secret ballot to force a
runoff, and says 100 lawmakers have pledged him support. Mrs.
Thatcher needs 214 votes to win outright.
   The Guardian newspaper published a poll of 1,446 people
indicating Mrs. Thatcher was still the overwhelming favorite of
Conservative Party voters.
   A poll of 1,084 people published in The Independent newspaper
had Conservatives running closer to the opposition Labor Party with
Heseltine as leader.
   The poll indicated the Tories now trailed Labor by 14 percentage
points. When the poll asked how people would vote with Heseltine as
Conservative leader, the gap shrank to five points.
   Much of Mrs. Thatcher's crisis is rooted in her party's 16-month
lag behind the Labor Party in opinion polls, mainly because of high
inflation, high interest rates and the poll tax.
   Division in her Cabinet over her attitude toward Europe's moves
toward economic integration helped precipitate the crisis in the
party as it looks nervously toward a general election which must be
held by mid-1992.
   Heseltine left Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 in a
Europe-related dispute.

   U.S. and Saudi Arabian forces
Thursday began a six-day amphibious exercise in the Persian Gulf
codenamed ``Imminent Thunder.'' Iraq called it a ``provocative
act'' because it was close to Kuwait.
   The exercise involved 1,000 U.S. Marines, 1,100 aircraft and 16
ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Midway, which arrived in
the region earlier this month.
   It was the largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise
since American forces began being deployed in the region under
Operation Desert Shield in early August.
   There have been three previous amphibious exercises in the gulf
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Iraq, but they were believed to
have been held farther south.
   While the exact location of Immninent Thunder was not revealed
under military policy and a news blackout was imposed for the
initial phases, a Pentagon spokesman said the exercise is centered
in eastern Saudi Arabia, about 100 miles from Kuwait.
   ``It is not right next to the Kuwaiti border,'' Lt. Cmdr. Edward
Lundquist said late Thursday in Washington. Press reports have said
the exercise would be 10 miles from the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.
   No live ammunition will be fired in Imminent Thunder.
   The exercise was not intended to provoke the Iraqis, said U.S.
Navy spokesman Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle.
   ``The purpose is to give participating forces training in oint
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills,''
he said. ``Exercise Imminent Thunder is part of our Desert Shield
training.''
   Military officials said there was no particular significance to
the name of the operation and that its timing was not linked to any
operational plans.
   But it is being held as the United States doubles the number of
aircraft carriers in the gulf region to six and sends in 150,000
additional military personnel to join the estimated 230,000 already
deployed. The entire U.S.-led multinational force arrayed against
Iraq numbers more than 300,000.
   The exercise was launched one day after British Defense
Secretary Tom King visited Saudi Arabia to discuss what
reinforcements Britain might send.
   The British have 16,000 personnel in the region, including the
9,000-man 7th ``Desert Rats'' Armoured Division, which became
operational Wednesday.
   King warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday: ``Time
is running out. We're not going to sit around forever.''
   Adm. Frank B. Kelso, the chief of naval operations who was in
the gulf visiting the destroyer USS O'Brien as part of an
inspection tour, refused to answer questions about Imminent
Thunder.
   ``We don't discuss details of future operations,'' Kelso said.
   He flew by helicopter out to the O'Brien, operating off Bahrain
to help enforce U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq to force it out
of Kuwait.
   Kelso said the additional three aircraft carriers on their way
means ``fundamentally, you have doubled your firepower.''
   The exercise included units of the Army, Navy, Air Force and
1,000 members of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Battalion. It also
included the Royal Saudi Air Force, and naval and marine units.
   Training will consist of an amphibious landing in eastern Saudi
Arabia with air cover and close air and naval support of ground
forces.
   Army Sgt. 1st Class Mickey Kershaw, 37, of West Islip, N.Y.,
said he felt it would be better to get on with the real fighting,
if there was to be any, instead of doing more training.
   ``It's a waste of time,'' he said of Imminent Thunder.
   He said he would rather fight Saddam's force now ``than do it
five years from now when this guy nukes me and the family I might
have.''

<TEXT>
   A small earthquake early Thursday in
central Oklahoma rattled nerves and caused some minor damage.
   The earthquake at 5:45 a.m. shook pictures off walls and knocked
objects off tables and shelves in the area of Lindsay, about 35
miles south of Oklahoma City. No serious damage or injuries were
reported.
   ``It felt weird because you could feel the building shaking. I
looked over on the wall and saw my calendar shaking,'' said Larry
Thompson, program director at KBLP radio in Lindsay.
   The Oklahoma Geological Survey said the quake registered 3.6 on
the Richter scale of ground movement and was centered 5 miles north
of Lindsay. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage. A
quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans.
   Geologists said interest in the temblor could have been fueled
by a quake projection for the New Madrid Fault in the Midwest in
early December.
   ``There's no correlation whatsoever,'' said Charles Mankin,
director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey in Norman.
   ``It's a completely different fault system,'' added Ken Luza, an
engineering geologist at the survey.
   New Mexico inventor Iben Browning has said there's a 50-50
chance of a major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault, which runs
from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark., hundreds of miles east of
Oklahoma.
   Most geologists have denounced Browning's forecast, but the
resulting controversy has kept earthquakes on the public mind
throughout the Midwest.
   Mankin said quakes are common in Oklahoma, with a couple
detected each week.
   ``We rarely record them as high as 3.6. But a small earthquake
in that area is not unusual,'' he said.

   President Bush said Thursday that he ordered a
massive increase in U.S. military power in the Persian Gulf instead
of digging in for a prolonged standoff because it is hard to keep
public support for a long-term struggle.
   ``I think holding public opinion forever in any country is very
difficult to do,'' Bush said in an interview with Cable News
Network on the eve of his departure for Europe and the Persian
Gulf.
   He was answering the question, Why had he decided on developing
a huge offensive capability for the possibility of a war rather
than laying preparations for a long stay in Saudi Arabia while
economic sanctions crippled Iraq.
   Bush said he would ``not put it in terms of time'' as to how
long he would wait for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``I don't think this matter is going to go on forever. As far as
I'm concerned, it's not.''
   Observing that he has probably not communicated to the public
his objectives in the Persian Gulf very well, Bush pledged not to
involve the country in a Vietnam-like war.
   ``I will not, as commander-in-chief, ever put somebody into a
military situation that we do not win - ever. And there's not going
to be any long drawn-out agony of Vietnam. So I reject the
parallel. But I can understand why people say that. Because they're
thinking, we don't want to have a drawn-out Vietnam.''
   The president spoke only hours after the chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Bush has
been inept in explaining his Persian Gulf policy to the American
people and must build a consensus for possible U.S. military
action.
   Recent congressional criticism of Bush's decision last week to
deploy an additional 200,000 U.S. troops to the gulf region to
provide offensive capabilities has called into focus the absence of
such a consensus, said Aspin, who supports the president's policy.
   Bush said has not decided yet to use military force against
Saddam and wants to ``preserve all options.''
   ``And one way to have a credible option is to have enough force
there to fulfill one's responsibilities if one has to exercise that
option. And that is what was behind my decision to move this amount
of force,'' he said.
   He said furthermore, he wanted to send a signal to Saddam that
``we are deadly serious'' about getting Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``And that message I hope will get out loud and clear to him
when he sees another hundred and some thousand of the best
equipped, best trained, best motivated forcs in the world up
against him,'' Bush added.
   Even if Saddam does withdraw from Kuwait and the rulers there
are restored Bush said, ``there would have to be some international
guarantees'' against Saddam's chemical weapons and his attempt to
develop a nuclear capability.
   ``I don't think the rest of the world would say this is good
enough, just what they call the status quo ante, going back to
where things were before the invasion,'' he said, without
specifying what the guarantees should be.
   Asked about public opinion surveys showing that public support
for his gulf policy was dwindling, Bush chalked it up in part to
``an enormous economic equation.'' He said the country is going
through ``an economic slowdown ... a disproportionate increase in
the price of oil that stems from what Saddam Hussein has done.''
   ``And it does mean jobs,'' he added.
   Reiterating that his motive is also to stand against Iraq's
agression, Bush said, ``If I haven't done as clear a job as I might
on explainihng this, then I've got to do better in that regard,
because I know in my heart of hearts that what we are doing is
right.''
   Bush, who has declined to say whether he would first go to
Congress before undertaking a military strike, said that he
recognizes Congress' constitutional right to declare war.
   ``And I have the right as commander in chief to fulfill my
responsibilities, and I'm going to safeguard those executive powers
and they have every right in the world to safeguard the powers of
the Congress,'' he said.
   ``President Bush has proven to be an inept communicator and has
failed to convey to the public why we are in Saudi Arabia,'' Aspin
said.
   Aspin said the president seemed on Wednesday to have allayed
lawmakers' concerns that he had decided to attack Iraqi forces.
   Now, Aspin said, ``somehow we've got to in Congress and in the
country come to the consensus with how we're going to deal with the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.'' And that will require better
communication from Bush, he indicated.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, interviewed by ABC News, said
he was holding hostages because their presence ``may help distract
anybody who may opt for war.''
   Hussein called on Bush to pledge not to attack Iraq, and added,
``An open pledge of this nature, a declared statement of this
nature, would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to leave
Iraq.''
   The State Department said no spokesman was available to comment
on Hussein's remarks.
   -Bush invoked emergency powers authorizing the Pentagon to
undertake military construction projects in the gulf region without
advance approval from Congress.
   -The House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee
announced that it will hold hearings on the economic impact of U.S.
involvement in the Middle East on Nov. 27 and Nov. 28.
   Aspin made his comments at a Capitol Hill news conference in
which he released an interim report card on the contributions U.S.
allies and other nations have made toward the gulf effort.
   ``The American people won't stand for our allies sitting out the
fighting while Americans are dying,'' Aspin said. His committee
will hold gulf hearings sometime after the Thanksgiving holiday, he
said.
   Aspin gave Turkey ``A-plus'' for its prompt response in shutting
down the oil pipeline from Iraq that runs through Turkey to the
Mediterranean Sea and for providing base facilities for U.S.
military units.
   Egypt also received an ``A-plus'' for its troop contributions.
   Aspin gave a grade of ``B'' to Saudi Arabia, complaining that
based on the amount of money the country has realized since the
crisis, now $150 million a day from increased oil prices.
   Some other grades:
   Japan, ``C'' for its financial contribution; the Soviet Union,
``B;'' Kuwait, ``A;'' Syria, ``B-plus;'' Yemen, Libya and Sudan,
all ``F.''
   The Pentagon said Tuesday the gulf states have contributed $6
billion so far.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after soldiers killed
six Jesuit priests in a massacre that received world attention, the
trial of those accused in the slayings has yet to start.
   The soldiers who pulled the triggers have confessed and are
likely to go to jail. But the senior officer charged in the deaths
may well go free, and the question of whether higher-ups were
involved is likely to remain a mystery.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday in
Washington:
   ``This brutal crime shocked the conscience of El Salvador and
the world. ... The United States insists on a full investigation
and prosecution. There is no issue regarding El Salvador to which
the ambassador and our embassy have devoted greater effort than the
pursuit of justice in the murder of the Jesuits.''
   The killings have cost El Salvador half of its $85 million in
American military aid planned for 1991 and called into question a
long tradition of substantial military impunity in human rights
cases. So far, no officer has ever been convicted of killing
civilians, though a few enlisted men have been.
   ``Those priests are causing us more problems dead than they did
alive,'' an army colonel said, commenting privately. He is one of
more than a dozen high-ranking officers who testified before Judge
Ricardo Zamora, the magistrate investigating the slayings and their
aftermath.
   The Jesuits, also professors at the Jesuit-run Central America
University, were killed five days after leftist rebels launched the
biggest offensive of their decade-old war against a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.
   The radical right and much of the military considered the
priests leftists for arguing that misery, injustice and repression
were the causes of the civil war. Conservative forces saw the war
as part of Communist expansion.
   The killings took place before dawn last Nov. 16. About 40
soldiers from the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion tramped across
the campus, pounded on the door and smashed windows of the Jesuits'
dormitory-like residence.
   According to statements by the soldiers, they roused the
educators and marched five of them to the yard behind the building.
The soldiers forced the five, including university rector Ignacio
Ellacuria, to lie face down.
   The soldiers said in their statements that Lt. Jose Espinoza
walked over to Pvt. Antonio Avalos who, along with Pvt. Oscar
Amaya, stood guard over the prostrate men.
   ``When are you going to proceed?'' Espinoza asked Avalos.
   Avalos said he took that as the signal to commence. So he and
Amaya fatally shot the priests in the head with their assault
rifles.
   The sixth priest, Father Joaquin Lopez, had been wounded in his
bedroom. He was finished off with four bullets when he grabbed the
foot of a soldier walking past him.
   Elba Ramos, the Jesuits' housekeeper, and her 15-year-old
daughter Celina, were murdered as they hugged each other on the
floor of a small bedroom. Espinoza said he was ordered by a colonel
who sent him to eliminate witnesses.
   Eight military men, including Col. Guillermo Benavides, are
under arrest and charged with the priests' murder. Another soldier
is a fugitive.
   Benavides did not take part in the killings but is accused of
ordering them.
   Father Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central
America, says the order maintains ``a hypothesis'' of guilt going
beyond Benavides. He said the Jesuits suspect a group of colonels
pressured Benavides to order the slayings.
   During 10 years of civil war, Salvadorans have suffered a wide
variety of right- and left-wing violence. Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero was gunned down by suspected right-wing triggermen as he
said Mass. Security forces raped and murdered three U.S. nuns and
their layworker companion. Soldiers and civilian death squads have
slain many common folk unknown beyond their hamlets, and Marxist
rebels have carried out their own killings.
   Last month, the U.S. Congress, which has bankrolled a succession
of Salvadoran governments, halved military aid for fiscal 1991. It
said the remaining aid would be cut if those responsible for the
Jesuit murders were not punished.
   Representative Joe Moakley, D-Mass., heads a U.S. congressional
delegation monitoring the investigation. In August he said:
``Salvadoran military officers have withheld evidence, destroyed
evidence, falsified evidence and repeatedly perjured themselves in
testimony before the judge.''
   Judicial sources say those who committed the murders likely will
get the maximum 30 years in prison.
   The only hard evidence incriminating Benavides is the testimony
of two lieutenants, among those charged with the murders. But under
Salvadoran law, testimony from a defendant is inadmissable as
evidence against a co-defendent.
   One judicial source said that if the case were to go to trial
tomorrow, and if the law were respected, Benavides would be
acquitted.
   But the Salvadoran judiciary is subject to political pressure.
The slain priests' colleagues predict Benavides will be convicted
simply because it is politically impossible to let him off.
   ``The armed forces need a scapegoat,'' said Father Rogelio
Pedraz, who runs the campus publishing house and who was not at the
residence the night of the massacre. He had left to pick up some
laundry.
   Until recently, Judge Zamora had hoped to start the trial this
year. Then a wrench landed in the works.
   Moakley on Oct. 18 revealed that U.S. Army Maj. Eric Buckland,
the adviser to the Salvadoran military who originally incriminated
Benavides, told FBI investigators in January that members of the
Salvadoran high command knew at least 10 days before the priests
were slain that Benavides intended to harm them.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce - then chief of the joint chiefs of staff
and now the Defense Minister - allegedly sent an envoy, accompanied
by Buckland, ``to calm down'' Benavides regarding the Jesuits.
   The affidavit containing that information, which Buckland later
recanted and which Ponce rejects as a lie, was not made available
to Moakley or Zamora until October.
   Zamora is planning to recall for further pre-trial testimony
some of those named by the U.S. major.

   President Bush leaves Friday on an eight-day
trip to the Middle East and Europe, becoming the first U.S.
president to visit front-line troops since Lyndon Johnson in
Vietnam. Before his Thanksgiving stop in Saudi Arabia, he'll sign a
historic East-West arms control agreement in Paris.
   The Persian Gulf crisis will dominate the tour, even while the
president is in Paris attending a 34-nation European summit.
   Aides said Bush would seek to coordinate his gulf policies when
he meets with leaders of the Soviet Union, Britain and France at
the three-day Paris gathering.
   In particular, U.S. officials said, Bush plans to sound out
these and other members of the 15-member U.N. Security Council on
wording of a proposed resolution to authorize force to drive Iraq
from Kuwait.
   Although the European summit is largely a celebration of the end
of the cold war, Bush is ``more than a one-topic president,'' said
a senior administration official.
   ``He understands the significance of what is going to go on in
Paris... By the same token, I am sure he will use opportunities as
they come along to discuss the gulf with others who are
attending,'' said the official, briefing reporters at the White
House on condition of anonymity.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew to Europe ahead of
Bush on Thursday to help lay groundwork on gulf policy. He was
meeting with foreign ministers of Security Council members,
including three African countries - Ethiopia, Zaire and the Ivory
Coast.
   Before leaving Washington, Baker said that while economic
sanctions against Iraq's Saddam Hussein seem to be working, ``the
real question is, are they working to achieve the goal'' of
Saddam's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Baker and Bush will link up again on Monday in Paris at the
beginning of the European summit.
   The centerpiece of the Paris session is a treaty sharply
reducing non-nuclear forces that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact
maintain in central and eastern Europe.
   It is the first major East-West agreement on conventional arms
since the end of World War II.
   In his session with Gorbachev early next week, Bush is likely to
discuss the condition of the troubled Soviet economy. The
administration is developing contingency plans to provide emergency
food and medicine to the Soviet Union to help it get through the
winter, officials said.
   The planning is based more on concern that disorders may
escalate than on food shortages, although they are severe, said the
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush was to leave Washington Friday evening for the trip, which
will begin with a one-day state visit to Prague, Czechoslovakia, on
the first anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution'' that ended years
of communist control.
   On Sunday, on his way to Paris, Bush will pay a five-hour visit
to recently reunified Germany. He will meet with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl at Kohl's home in a suburb of Ludwigshafen.
   After three days in Paris, Bush will begin the Middle East
segment of his trip. He will visit U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
on Thanksgiving Day.
   The president on Thursday invited top congressional leaders from
both parties to join him on Thanksgiving Day. Officials said it was
not yet known whether those leaders - House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. - would make the trip.
   The White House will not discuss specific sites for security
reasons, but Bush is expected to visit forces both on a naval
vessel and in desert encampments in Saudi Arabia.
   It will mark the first visit of a U.S. president to front-line
troops since President Johnson visited forces during a half-day
visit to Vietnam in 1967.
   Bush will wind up the eight-day trip with a stop in Cairo,
Egypt, on Friday, where he will meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.

   Atlantis lit up the sky in a rare
launch in darkness Thursday as it streaked into orbit on a secret
military mission that reportedly will send a satellite to spy on
Iraq.
   The shuttle thundered from its oceanside launch pad at 6:48 p.m.
EST, trailed by a 700-foot-pillar of flame. On board were five
astronauts who will deploy the satellite during the flight.
   Mission control's Jeff Carr described the launch as ``picture
perfect, absolutely no anomalies to report.'' He said the mission
commander described the liftoff as ``spectacular.''
   ``This was really just about as smooth a count and liftoff and
early few minutes of a mission as I've ever seen,'' said NASA
Administrator Richard Truly.
   The 100-ton spaceship was visible for miles as it rocketed into
the nighttime sky.
   It was the fifth after-dark launch in 37 shuttle flights. It
also was NASA's fifth launch for 1990 and the seventh and probably
last Pentagon mission to be shrouded in secrecy.
   Two minutes into the flight, Atlantis' two solid fuel rockets
burned out and dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. The shuttle reached
an undisclosed orbit 6{ minutes later on the thrust of its three
main liquid fuel engines, and all public communications with the
craft were cut off.
   Throughout the day, high crosswinds and low clouds threatened to
delay the launch, but the weather improved. The countdown also was
unaffected by a last-minute problem with a unit at the launch pad
used to cool the shuttle.
   A news blackout has been imposed on Atlantis' four-day flight,
during which the astronauts will deploy a satellite that sources
said is to spy on Iraq. Experts believe it is either a photographic
imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft.
   Atlantis carried a spy satellite into orbit during its last
flight in March.
   The shuttle's all-military crew, commanded by Air Force Col.
Richard Covey, has been waiting for months to fly this mission. The
flight was scheduled for July but was delayed indefinitely when
Atlantis was found during a fueling test in June to have dangerous
hydrogen leaks.
   It was the second shuttle to be crippled by leaking hydrogen.
Columbia's astronomy mission was scrubbed in May when the spaceship
sprang leaks during fueling.
   ``We finally got there, fixed the leaks, which is again a
testimony to the team,'' said launch director Bob Sieck. ``We do
find problems, they do occur. But we fix them, and we'll get on
with what we're supposed to do which is flying these machines
safely and successfully.''
   During the grounding, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration replaced Atlantis' external fuel tank, plumbing
between the orbiter and tank, and valve seals. In addition,
Atlantis' military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering
information in the Persian Gulf.
   Atlantis, like Columbia, was cleared for flight during a fueling
test last month.
   NASA set a Nov. 9 launch date for Atlantis, but the Air Force
delayed that mission because of undisclosed cargo problems. That
trouble quickly was resolved, clearing the way for Thursday's
liftoff attempt.
   Also on the crew are Navy Cmdr. Frank Culbertson Jr., pilot; and
Army Capt. Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine
Col. Robert Springer, all mission specialists.
   The Pentagon has imposed a news blackout on the flight similar
to its six previous missions. Because of the expense in maintaining
secure operations, officials said this would be the last military
shuttle mission to be conducted in secrecy.
   The Pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times in 1991,
but the cargoes in each instance will be unclassified. Military
officials will rely on unmanned rockets - primarily the giant Titan
4 - to carry other payloads into orbit.
   So far, the Air Force has sent up three Titan 4 rockets, the
most powerful unmanned launcher in the United States. The third one
blasted off Monday night from Cape Canaveral.
   Air Force Col. Frank Stirling, who heads the Titan 4 program,
said a fleet of unmanned rockets will offer greater reliability
than NASA's shuttle.
   ``We had in a sense committed all our resources for space access
to one program, the space shuttle with only four orbiters,''
Stirling said.
   ``With Titan we have a continuing production line with many
Titans available so that if we should ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Agrees on Maine Environmental Fine for Shipyard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has agreed that the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard must observe Maine environmental laws and that fines
and fees for past violations will total more than $1 million, state
officials said Thursday.
   Still pending was whether the state has the authority to collect
the money from the federal government.
   The agreement is part of a consent decree that settles nearly
all of the issues in the state's lawsuit against the Navy stemming
from violations of Maine's hazardous-waste laws at the shipyard in
Kittery, Maine's southernmost town.
   While the two sides agree on the fine total, the Navy still
reserves the right to have the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decide whether it actually has to pay, Maine Assistant Attorney
General Dennis J. Harnish said.
   ``Certainly the decision at the 1st Circuit will have a
substantial impact and this (consent decree) sets the stage for
that,'' Harnish said.
   At stake would be civil penalties of $887,200, and total
hazardous waste generator and licensing fees of $267,886, for a
total of nearly $1.16 million.
   Officials at the Portsmouth atomic submarine-repair facility's
public affairs office did not return telephone messages left
Thursday.
   Maine filed two lawsuits in 1986 asking that the shipyard be
required to clean up inactive solid waste and hazardous waste
dumps, including a landfill and a mercury disposal area.
   The state, in the suit that originated in York County Superior
Court, claimed that the Navy dumped hazardous wastes into a
treatment plant that could not handle them, gave wastes to
unlicensed handlers, illegally accepted wastes from other
installations and expanded its waste storage yard without the
state's approval.
   The state also charged that the shipyard was responsible for 14
oil spills and that it had not paid fees to the state for
generating hazardous wastes.
   In November 1988, U.S. District Judge Gene Carter rejected the
Navy's argument that the federal government had not waived its
immunity, allowing the state to impose its fines and fees.
   The Navy is appealing that ruling to the 1st Circuit Court, said
Harnish.

   Hindus battled Moslems with knives,
stones and glass bottles in New Delhi on Thursday and Sikh
extemists mounted other attacks in new religious and separatist
fighting, police and news reports said. At least 18 people were
reported killed Wednesday and Thursday in Punjab alone, the
Sikh-dominated state to the north.
   The violence pitted the Sikh and Moslem minorities against the
majority Hindus.
   Religious clashes sweeping India over the past month have killed
more than 385 people, most of them Moslems. The fighting was
sparked by a Hindu plan to take over a disputed mosque in the
northern town of Ayodhya.
   Hindus and Moslems, inflamed by religious fighting in the
capital that killed six people Wednesday, fought street battles in
New Delhi's Sadar Bazaar neighborhood.
   Police fired bullets and tear gas to stop the rioting in the
Hindu locale, and at least 12 people were wounded, witnesses said.
   Elsewhere in the city, Sikh youths stoned buses and Hindu-owned
shops.
   In Punjab, police said Sikh separatists shot and killed seven
bus passengers Wednesday. Eleven additional people were killed in
other violence in the state Wednesday and Thursday, the United News
of India news agency reported. Many of the victims were Hindus.
   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, who took office Saturday,
visited Sadar Bazaar on Thursday and blamed the violence on
infiltrators from Pakistan, UNI said. The government of V.P. Singh
was brought down by India's religious and caste feuds.
   UNI also quoted intelligence reports as saying Pakistanis
disguised as Sikhs had entered India to foment trouble.
   India has long accused Pakistan of abetting separatist revolts
and religious strife here. The two countries have fought three
wars. Pakistan, an Islamic nation, has denied the charges. New
Delhi has offered little proof.
   Violence broke out in New Delhi on Wednesday after about 15,000
Moslems and Sikhs met at a mosque in Sadar Bazaar to appeal for
solidarity of minority religious communities against what they
called rising Hindu fundamentalism.
   A group broke from the meeting and attacked Hindu homes and
shops. Three Moslems, two Hindus and a Hindu police officer were
killed in the rioting and gunfire, according to police count. Press
Trust of India said seven died.
   On Thursday, Hindu and Moslem mobs clashed again, defying curfew
orders restricting people to their homes.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi said at least 11
people were injured, six by police bullets and five in the rioting.
   Witnesses said many more were injured.
   In Tilak Nagar, a mainly Hindu locality 10 miles southwest of
Sadar Bazaar, Sikh students hurled stones at buses and Hindu-owned
shops after their principal made an anti-Hindu speech Thursday, a
police official said.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for in independent nation in
Punjab since 1983, accusing the Hindu majority of discrimination.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, Moslems
12 percent and Sikhs 2 percent.

<HEAD>Anti-Piracy Action Filed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. industries formally asked the
government Thursday to penalize Thailand for tolerating piracy of
American movies, music, books, computer software and trademarks.
   An unfair trade complaint was filed with the office of the U.S.
trade representative that could bring formal hearings and lead to
new penalties against Thai exports to the United States.
   The action was brought jointly by the Recording Industry
Association of America, the Motion Picture Export Association of
America and the International Intellectual Property Alliance,
representing more than 1,600 companies that produce and distribute
motion pictures, computers and software, television programs and
home videocassettes, music tapes, records and discs, books and
professional journals.
   The industries said the Thai government ignored an October
warning that the complaint would be filed unless the Thai
government met their demand for measures against ``unhindered
piracy'' which they say will cost them $70 million to $100 million
this year.
   Thai Embassy Commercial Counselor Wisitsee Chintana said the
October warning had been sent immediately to Bangkok and the
government was doing its best to solve the problem, including
drafting legislation for submission to parliament. She said she
could not comment further without knowing more about the complaint.
   After Thai Prime Minister Chattichai Choonhavan's White House
visit in June, there was some hope for a crackdwn against known
Thai manufacturers turning out tens of thousands of pirated music
audiocassettes daily., said Jay Berman, president of the Recording
Industry Association of America.
   But ``obviously the Thai government does not consider the issue
of sufficient importance to take action,'' he added.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Pictur Export Association,
called Thailand ''the worst offender of intellectual property
rights in Asia.''
   ``We regret the need to go to these lengths to get Thailand
simply to enforce its existing copyright law,'' he added. ``The
Thai government must be made to realize that we now have no
alternative but to ask our government to close the U.S. market to
important Thai exports like jewelry, textile products or blank
videotape, if immediate action is not taken to stem the more than
$130 million in losses our members have suffered over the last 10
years.''
   According to Valenti, ``illegal copies of American movies are on
sale throughout Thailand within days of their release in the United
States and well before their legitimate release in Thailand.
American movies are increasingly screened without license by
illegal Thai cable TV systems outside of Bangkok.''
   In 1989, the U.S. government put Thailand on a ``priority watch
list' because of the issue and withheld duty concessions on $165
million worth of Thai exports to the United States. No further
action was taken, however, and Thailand enjoyed a $1.4 billion
trade surplus with America for the year.

<HEAD>Ohio Court Throws Out Rap Group's Disorderly Conduct Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has cleared members of
the rap group NWA of a disorderly conduct conviction they received
after a June 1989 concert at Riverfront Coliseum.
   Three members of the Los Angeles-based group had been convicted
in Hamilton County Municipal Court. But the 1st Ohio District Court
of Appeals threw out the convictions Wednesday, ruling that the
entertainers did not break the law when they asked women in the
audience if they wanted to have sex.
   The appeals court ruled that the requests, made onstage during
the concert, did not break the law because they likely did not
inconvenience, annoy or alarm anyone.
   All five members of NWA were charged after police said their
remarks were obscene. The three members involved in Wednesday's
ruling - Lorenzo ``MC Ren'' Patterson, Oshea ``Ice Cube'' Jackson
and Todd ``Too-Short'' Shaw - were convicted by Judge Harry
McIlwain and fined $100 each.
   During the trial, both sides agreed that NWA asked women in the
audience if they wanted to have sex with rapper Eric ``Eazy-E''
Wright. But the defense argued that language did not constitute the
kind of ``fighting words'' required for a disorderly conduct
conviction.
   H. Louis Sirkin, the group's attorney, also argued that NWA's
comments were protected free speech under the First Amendment.
   The appeals court skipped the constitutional issues and reversed
the case on the evidence. Ohio law says disorderly conduct must
``recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.''
   ``We're thrilled,'' Jerry Heller, NWA's manager, said of the
decision. Heller said NWA members are busy in a Canoga Park,
Calif., studio recording two albums.

<TEXT>
   Pressure from the United States and Japan led
the World Bank to postpone $450 million in loans to Brazil,
officials said Thursday.
   These officials, who disclosed the delay on condition that they
not be identified, said the object of the postponement was to make
Brazil come up with some of the $8 billion in interest it owes to
commercial banks and has not paid for nearly a year and a half.
   Brazil's international debt totals $114 billion, the largest of
any third-world country. More than $67 billion, not counting the
unpaid interest, is owed to commercial banks. A large fraction of
that is owed to U.S. and Japanese banks.
   Zelia Cardoso de Mello, Brazil's minister of Economy, was
reported readying a new offer to the commercial banks.
   The World Bank's Board of Executive Directors, who represent the
143 owner governments, has been considering two new loans to
Brazil. One, for $300 million, would got to the Brazilian
government's National Bank for Economic and Social Development, to
help it lend more to private business.
   Another loan, for $150 million, had been destined for the
Brazilian government's secretariat of Science and Technology.
   The World Bank released a statement on Thursday saying that
these two loans had been approved but James Riddleberger, a bank
spokesman, said the statement was a mistake. The directors had not
approved any loan to Brazil, he said.
   Officials explained that an objection in the closed-door
directors' meeting had been raised by Japan, and the United States
backed the objection.
   The loans may be reconsidered in a week or two in light of
Brazil's talks in New York with commercial banks.
   The officials said the World Bank had been planning about $1
billion in loans to Brazil by the end of next March. Brazil already
owes the World Bank $8.1 billion and is not seriously behind on
those interest payments - new loans would not be considered if it
were.

   Convicted murderer Lawrencia
``Bambi'' Bembenek and her fiance, Dominic Gugilatto, have asked
permission to marry, Canadian jail authorities said.
   The Milwaukee couple remained in jail Thursday following their
arrest last month in this Canadian tourist city. They had lived and
worked here after Ms. Bembenek's escape from a Wisconsin prison.
   Thunder Bay Jail Superintendent John Mackenzie will make a
decision on the marriage request Friday morning, hours before
Gugliatto is scheduled to be deported to the United States, Deputy
jail superintendent Michael Coons said.
   If their request is approved, Ms. Bembenek and Gugliatto will be
married in a large office at the maximum security jail, Coons said.
   Gugliatto, 35, faces charges in Wisconsin of allegedly aiding
and abetting Ms. Bembenek's escape in Fond du Lac in southeastern
Wisconsin. The deportation was ordered after Canadian immigration
authorities determined that Gugliatto had worked in the country
without authorization.
   A hearing to determine whether Ms. Bembenek will be deported was
set for Nov. 22.
   Ms. Bembenek, a former model, Milwaukee police officer and
Playboy club waitress, created a media sensation when she escaped
from the Taycheedah Correctional Institution on July 15. Canadian
police captured her and Gugliatto on Oct. 17.
   Ms. Bembenek, 32, was serving a life sentence for the 1981
murder of her former husband's ex-wife.
   Coons said the couple made the request to get married while in
custody earlier this month.
   A husband-wife privilege that prevents spouses from being
compelled to testify against each other probably would not apply in
the case of Gugliatto and Ms. Bembenek because all the alleged
crimes occurred before marriage, said Fond du Lac County Sheriff's
Lt. Ed Sheppard.

<HEAD>CDC: AIDS Risk From Medical Waste Small, But Urges Better
Management</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday the
risk of getting AIDS from contact with medical waste is relatively
small, but it recommended hospitals try to reduce the amount of
waste generated.
   The waste report was based on a study presented to Congress
earlier this fall by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry, like the CDC an arm of the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The report, which measured the health impact of medical waste,
estimated that a maximum of four AIDS cases a year occur among
health care workers who suffer injuries from needles or other sharp
objects in waste from hospitals and doctors' offices.
   That would represent .01 percent of the 35,238 U.S. AIDS cases
reported to the CDC in 1989.
   The study also estimated that as many as 160 hepatitis B cases a
year, about .1 percent of the total, may occur because of contact
with medical waste.
   The CDC said the risk of these diseases from medical waste is
particularly small for the general public, which usually is not in
contact with these materials. Federal health officials in the past
have urged health care workers to take precautions, such as wearing
protective clothing, when dealing with medical waste.
   Though the report downplayed the health risk, it and the CDC
stressed the need for better management of medical waste, which
comprises about .3 percent of the 158 million tons of municipal
solid waste created each year in the United States.
   ``The most effective way of reducing medical waste is to reduce
the amount of waste created, on a small scale in homes and on a
large scale in health care operations,'' the CDC report said.
   The CDC urged more emphasis on recycling, reuse and reclamation
of medical waste.

   The surroundings of Greta Garbo's very private
life were sold Thursday for higher than expected prices during the
last of three auctions.
   The sales at Sotheby's brought an estimated $20.7 million,
including the auction house commission.
   ``The family is ecstatic,'' said Ted Kurz, lawyer for the Garbo
estate. He said the auction showed ``the public remembers Greta
Garbo and appreciates the fact that she was a great collector and
had a good eye.''
   Thursday's sale had been expected to draw about $700,000 to $1
million, but brought $2.5 million.
   The Tuesday and Wednesday portions of ``The Greta Garbo
Collection'' auction brought $18.2 million, with Renoir's 1889
portrait of his nephew fetching the highest price of any one piece
- $7 million. In addition, Renoir's ``Leontine and Coco Reading''
brought $5.7 million and Bonnard's ``Corn Poppies'' sold for $3.2
million.
   Thursday's auction was not about great works of art; it was
about the film legend herself and the elegant, serene world the
actress created in her Manhattan apartment for 38 years.
   None of her personal articles was for sale - no slouch hats,
dark glasses, Art Deco cigarette holders or turtleneck sweaters.
   The paintings of rose-filled vases, the gracefully carved Louis
XV chairs, the pretty porcelain and enamel boxes and the
morroco-bound books by Emerson, Hawthorne, Shelley, Goethe and
Schiller make the life of the film legend tangible.
   ``This is a personal collection. It reflects totally one
person's taste, vision, preference,'' Gray Reisfeld, Garbo's niece
and the sole benefactor and executor of her estate, wrote in the
auction catalog. Garbo died April 15.
   Small paintings and little porcelain boxes that were estimated
to sell for $100 to $200 sold for 30 times that amount. An oil
painting of a white terrier, valued at $600 to $800, sold for
$17,000. An oil still life of flowers in a basket, valued between
$100 and $200, sold for $3,000.
   The highest price paid for a painting at the sale was $170,000
for ``A Woman in White, Seated,'' an oil on canvas dated 1912 by
Albert Andre.
   ``She was mystical and exciting and extremely gifted,''
Constance Ford said of Garbo, after placing a winning bid of $2,250
for a pottery figure of a clown.
   Many Garbo fans were disappointed by the auction's high prices.
   ``I think she would have wanted someone like me to have
something, instead of the people who have all the bucks,'' said
Sherry Ostrow of West Orange, N.J.
   Garbo bought most of her paintings, furniture and objets d'art
on her legendary walks through Manhattan; in the art and antique
shops she frequented, she was known as ``Mrs. Brown'' or simply
``G.G.''
   She chose her own colors - mostly roses, salmons and greens -
arranged her furniture and hung her paintings herself.
   ``She had created this refuge and was proud of it,'' Gray oran,
Mrs. Reisfield's daughter and Garbo's great-niece, wrote in the
auction catalog.

<TEXT>
   Helicopters made repeated water drops
Thursday on a 34,000-acre wildfire nea the Missouri River in
rugged mountain timber considered too dangerous for fire crews to
operate on the ground.
   ``It's not a safe situation to try to put people in, so we're
going to try to drown that stuff out,'' said Bob Krepps of the U.S.
Forest Service.
   The aerial assault concentrated on the southern flank of the
fire near the boundary between the Gates of the Mountains
Wilderness and adjacent Beartooth Game Range in the western Montana
Rockies.
   It was a cool, windy day in western Montana, with temperatures
near 40 and gusts up to 30 mph.
   Stiff westerly winds fanned flames on the fire's eastern flank
as well, and crews were sent in to battle flareups, said Dave
Turner, a fire information officer at the Interagency Dispatch
Center near Helena.
   ``That's the most remote, the furthest (area of fire) away from
the fire camp'' and fire managers were considering setting up an
auxiliary or ``spike camp'' to put firefighters closer to the
action, Turner said.
   Officials expressed satisfaction Thursday at progress toward
containing the unusual late-season blaze.
   Turner said it was 20 percent contained by Thursday afternoon.
Krepps said that about 10 percent to 15 percent of the total fire
area still was burning actively, while the fire had burned itself
out on most of the rest of the 34,000 acres.
   ``We're down to the dirty stuff now of making sure things are
secure,'' Krepps said in a telephone interview from the fire
command post near Wolf Creek. ``We're hitting the hotter areas
today; then it's going to be cleanup for the next couple of days.''
   About 400 firefighters were called in to combat the blaze, which
broke out Tuesday in the rugged Big Belt Mountains about 35 miles
northeast of Helena. Authorities said it appeared to have started
accidentally at a hunting camp.
   At least 30 rural homes were evacuated and about two dozen
hunters fled the area Tuesday night, many on horseback. One group
of hunters survived the flames by jumping into a mountain creek.
   Firefighters have been hampered by limited daylight and
nighttime temperatures that dipped below freezing, but those same
temperatures helped to limit the spread of the fire, Turner said.
   ``What continues to be the problem are the dry conditions,'' he
said.
   Elsewhere, firefighters were sent home Thursday after containing
a 33,000-acre grass and timber fire on the Fort Belknap Indian
Reservation, about 190 miles northeast of the Missouri River fire.
   A skeleton crew of eight to 10 firefighters was to remain at the
scene Friday, said Jim Greene, a Department of State Lands official
who commanded the firefighters.
   The fire, which is believed to have started in a landfill near
the reservation town of Lodgepole, destroyed a trailer house, a
small barn and some outbuildings, and killed one cow, authorities
said.

   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops were told
on Thursday that their long, sidetracked struggle to delineate
church rights of women still is ``alive and well.''
   After seven years, ``the work continues,'' said Bishop Joseph L.
Imesch of Joliet, Ill., head of a committee striving to shape a
pastoral letter on women that would be fair to them.
   Past drafts of the proposed teaching letter have been widely
criticized as contradictory in asserting equal standing of women,
yet reiterating that they remain ineligible for the most
influential role, the priesthood.
   In a discussion of the difficulties with the letter at the
annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
Auxiliary Bishop Francis P. Murphy of Baltimore said:
   ``This is a very unhappy time.'' But he commended the continued
grappling with the issue.
   ``It has raised the consciousness of the church in this country
and thrown light on the equal or unequal experience of women in the
church and society,'' he said.
   Action on the letter initially had been scheduled at this week's
meeting of the bishops, but this was postponed in September by an
administrative committee.
   In a closing session of their four-day meeting, the bishops
also:
   -Approved principles for more gender neutral language in a new
lectionary, the cycle of Bible readings for worship service.
   Terms such as ``brethren'' would be rendered ``brothers and
sisters'' and ``man'' as ``people.'' Also, blanket pejorative
references to ``the Jews'' become ``the Jewish authorities'' or
``leaders.''
   -Modified a planned pastoral letter on the 1992 observance of
the coming of Columbus and Europeans to America, to recognize
abuses inflicted on American Indians and blacks.
   As for the pastoral letter on women, Imesch said, ``I want to
erase any doubt about the future'' of the project. He said
suggested changes were continuing to be received, and would be
considered.
   Asked afterward if there was any discomfort among the bishops,
one of the country's last exclusively male organizations, in trying
to define the place of women, he said:
   ``There's a great deal of uncomfortability.''
   He added that there has been much input from women in hearings
across the country. But he said ``it would be a miracle'' if the
drafters were able to overcome the hurdle of reconciling the
principle of women's equality with church rules barring their
ordination.
   But miracles can happen, he added.
   Dropping of the letter from the bishops' current agenda came
after the Vatican suggested prior consultation with bishops
conferences in other countries before taking action.
   Imesch told reporters some suggestions about the letter from
Rome might or might not be accepted, adding, ``We may not accept
all those locally or from Rome.''
   Pope John Paul II at one point ordered no more discussion of the
idea of women's ordination.

   Stripping Manuel Noriega of his fortune and forcing
him to accept court-appointed lawyers would be unfair and make the
U.S. judicial system look bad, some of the nation's top legal
scholars say.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler has set a Friday deadline
for Noriega's private attorneys to work out payment and resume
working on the drug-smuggling case. Otherwise, the judge will
appoint government-paid counsel for the deposed Panamanian
dictator.
   The Criminal Justice Act, which governs such appointments,
allows for only two or three relatively low-paid lawyers and a few
thousand dollars for investigating the case.
   Noriega's current lawyers object, saying the government reneged
on President Bush's pledge to give Noriega a fair trial. Some legal
experts agree.
   ``It's made it an unfair and unbalanced prosecution,'' said
Harvard University law Professor Alan Dershowitz. ``It's extremely
unfair to take a case where the United States has put incredible
resources and ask someone to defend it on the basis of the CJA
budget.''
   Cable News Network asked Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy on Thursday to let it broadcast tape recordings of
Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers.
   Network lawyers asked Kennedy to set aside a federal judge's
order banning such broadcasts. Kennedy referred the matter to the
full court and ordered lawyers for Noriega and the Bush
administration to file responses by noon Saturday.
   The FBI, meanwhile, said it had obtained CNN tapes taken from an
Atlanta hotel lost-and-found to see if they include portions of the
material involved in the court battle. The network protested that
the tapes were obtained without a warrant.
   The defense estimates that the Justice Department is using 25 to
30 lawyers and will spend up to $30 million to prosecute Noriega.
   University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar said the
case's investigative phase is often more important than the trial
in a complicated prosecution like Noriega's - and that's precisely
where court-appointed lawyers are at a disadvantage.
   Neal Sonnett, who recently ended a term as president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said the law's
allowable budget makes the case ``a mismatch.''
   He noted that the case already has shown it is forging new law
in many areas - the U.S. invasion of Panama, Noriega's status as a
prisoner of war and a head of state, the frozen accounts, and the
battle over Cable News Network's broadcast of taped telephone
calls.
   ``In a case of this magnitude, with all the issues at stake, the
United States should be bending over backward to ensure Noriega has
the lawyers of his choice,'' said Sonnett, who once worked on the
Noriega case.
   William Greenhalgh, a Georgetown University law professor, said
the case's prestige may allow the judge to find top-level lawyers
prepared to take the case, even at a fraction of their normal
rates.
   But he agreed that the investigative resources are inadequate,
and worried that Hoeveler is insisting on a trial by Jan. 28 or
shortly thereafter.
   ``I think it would be most unfortunate if (the judge) pushes
whoever he appoints to go to trial before they're ready,''
Greenhalgh said. ``If I got appointed to it, I would be filing a
huge motion for continuance.''
   Another issue disturbing the experts is that Noriega's pauper
status was created by the government. Soon after the invasion of
Panama, the Justice Department asked foreign nations to freeze 27
bank accounts holding about $20 million in money allegedly
controlled by Noriega.
   Hoeveler ordered that money freed in June, but prosecutors
responded that the foreign governments stepped in with their own
confiscation procedures, tying up the money indefinitely.
   Justice Department spokesmen refused to comment about
court-appointment law because of its application to the case.
   One of the few organizations favoring the law's use in Noriega's
case is the conservative Washington Legal Foundation.
   ``The Sixth Amendment entitles him to adequate counsel,'' said
the foundation's chief counsel, Richard Samp. ``It doesn't entitle
him to the best counsel he can get in the country.''
   But even Samp said he has doubts about freezing Noriega's assets
in the first place.
   ``I have qualms about any pretrial procedures in which the
government takes away people's assets,'' he said. ``Noriega ought
to have a chance to contest that.''
   One lawyer who knows the resources the government will use is
Jose Quinon, who unsuccessfully defended Colombian drug lord Carlos
Lehder Rivas, now serving a life sentence.
   Quinon, immediate past president of the Florida Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers, estimates Noriega's lawyers would need
$750,000 for investigations alone, but will be lucky to get $5,000
or $10,000 under the court appointment law.
   ``They'll convict him not because of the evidence, but because
the defense had inadequate resources,'' said Quinon.
   Most of the experts agreed that using court-appointed lawyers in
the high-profile case will look bad in the glare of international
publicity.
   ``This is the kind of case we should be showing the world how
fair we are and what kind of criminal justice system we have,''
Quinon said. ``But this whole thing is now an embarrassment not
only for the government, but the courts and society as a whole.''

   Settling Congress' last undecided race,
election officials said Thursday that Republican Randy ``Duke''
Cunningham defeated Democratic Rep. Jim Bates.
   A late tally of absentee ballots gave Cunningham, a former Navy
pilot, a total of 50,335 votes, or 46.3 percent, to Bates' 48,676
votes, or 44.8 percent, election officials said.
   California now has 26 Democrat and 19 Republican
representatives, a gain of one seat for the GOP.
   The results of the Nov. 6 election had been delayed while
officials counted thousands of absentee ballots. Authorities said
about 200 absentee ballots remained outstanding and would not
affect the outcome.
   Bates, 49, the only Democratic congressman south of the Los
Angeles area, had declined to concede defeat. It was his first
re-election campaign since the House ethics committee reprimanded
him for sexually harassing two female aides.
   During the campaign, Bates said the reprimand was an old issue.
If voters were concerned about it, he said, they would have thrown
him out in the June primary or in 1988, when harassment accusations
surfaced.

   Key national leaders on Thursday rejected a proposed emergency
Arab summit to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis. Despite Iraqi
protests, U.S. and Saudi forces launched ``Imminent Thunder'' - a
six-day amphibious exercise near Kuwait.
   President Bush, who leaves for Europe and the gulf Friday, said
he ordered the big buildup in U.S. military power in the area
instead of waiting out Iraq because it is hard to keep public
support for a long-term struggle.
   Bush was replying to a query in an interview with Cable News
Network on why he chose to develop a major offensive capability for
possible war instead of planning a long stay in Saudi Arabia while
economic sanctions cripple Iraq.
   Two more Americans arrived in Amman, Jordan, on a regularly
scheduled flight from Baghdad. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the
two were U.S. diplomats, but it was unclear whether they had worked
in Kuwait or Iraq.
   The Americans arrived along with 24 other foreigners - 22 Irish
citizens, one Dutch national and one Briton. They all were medical
personnel from a foreign-run hospital in Baghdad.
   Saddam Hussein said in an interview with ABC-TV he would release
the foreign hostages he is holding as ``human shields'' in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait only if Bush promises not to attack his country.
   ``Such an open pledge of this nature - a declared statement of
this nature - would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to
leave Iraq,'' the Iraqi president said.
   Iraq says it is holding hundreds of foreigners at strategic
locations such as military installations to protect against attack.
   Saddam, interviewed in a government guest house in Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital, said he regrets holding the hostages.
   ``This is the only decision which we have taken which rather
chokes us up,'' he said.
   However, he again asserted that the hostages were his best
protection against attack.
   ``The only justification for this situtation is that the
presence of these people may help distract anybody who may opt for
war. It may make them hesitate a little before jumping into a
decision of this nature,'' he said.
   As for dialogue with the United States, Saddam said he was
unwilling to meet Bush's demand that Iraq unconditionally withdraw
from Kuwait.
   ``This is not dialogue. These are preconditions imposed to
insure our capitulation,'' he said. ``We reject such
preconditions.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency announced Thursday that Bush
would go ``on trial'' in absentia next month in Algeria - for
``inhuman policies and planning aggression against the people of
Iraq.''
   The trial will begin Dec. 10 in Algiers, INA said, in what it
called an international court of justice.
   It said the verdict would be relayed to U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar and international groups concerned with
human rights.
   Iraq first spoke of putting Bush on trial in September, after
Western leaders said Saddam should be tried for war crimes.
   Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
became the latest Arab leaders to reject the emergency Arab summit,
which was billed by the king of Morocco as perhaps the ``last
chance'' for peace.
   Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not participate in the
meeting unless Baghdad promised beforehand to leave Kuwait, which
it invaded Aug. 2. Iraq made it clear that no such promise was
forthcoming.
   In a joint statement released in Damascus, Assad and Mubarak
said they also rejected the idea because of Iraq's intransigence.
And in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's government-in-exile also
objected, citing Iraq's refusal to withdraw.
   The objections effectively killed chances for the summit. A few
Arab League members, including Sudan and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, had agreed to Morocco's proposal.
   Both Syria and Egypt have contributed troops to the
300,000-strong U.S.-led multinational force confronting Iraq.
   The appeal on Sunday by King Hassan II of Morocco for Arab
leaders to gather provoked a flurry of diplomatic activity. Among
those trying to promote the summit was the Soviet Union, which sent
high-level envoys to the Middle East this week to discuss the idea.
   While the exact location of Imminent Thunder, which began
Thursday, was not revealed, and a news blackout was imposed for the
initial phases of the operation, a Pentagon spoesman said in
Washington the exercise was based in eastern Saudi Arabia, about
100 miles from Kuwait.
   The operation involves 1,000 U.S. Marines, 1,100 aircraft and 16
ships. Iraq has termed it a ``provocative act'' because it is being
held close to occupied Kuwait.
   There have been three previous amphibious exercises in the
Persian Gulf, but they were believed to have been held farther
south. On Wednesday, the Washington Times reported Imminent Thunder
would be held 10 miles from Kuwait. No live ammunition will be
fired in the operation, U.S. officials say. But it will involve the
largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise since U.S.
forces were deployed in the region in August.
   Imminent Thunder is not intended to provoke the Iraqis, said
U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle.
   ``The purpose is to give participating forces training in joint
and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills,''
he said.
   Military officials said there was no particular significance to
the name of the operation and that its timing was not linked to any
operational plans.
   The United States has doubled the number of aircraft carriers in
the gulf region to six, and ordered in about 200,000 additional
military personnel to join the estimated 230,000 already deployed.
The multinational force arrayed against Iraq numbers more than
300,000.
   In other developments, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
headed Thursday to Brussels, on his way to yet another round of
consultations with foreign leaders.
   Baker was to meet Friday with the 12-nation European Community,
which is providing aid to countries that have been hit hard by the
trade embargo against Iraq.
   Over the weekend, he was to meet with the foreign ministers of
three African countries as well as Romania and Finland.
   Elsewhere on the diplomatic front, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati was in Iraq on Thursday, meeting with Saddam and
visiting Moslem shrines.
   Velayati, the highest-ranking Iranian to visit Iraq since the
1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, said he had made it clear to
Saddam and other senior officials that Tehran wanted Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   The two countries fought each other for nearly a decade during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

   Federal health officials warn those with a taste
for the Southern delicacy chitterlings, pork intestines also known
as chitlins, avoid touching children while preparing the dish.
   The warning from the federal Centers for Disease Control follows
an outbreak of gastroenteritis among Atlanta area children during
the 1988-89 winter holidays.
   Fifteen children got sick, the CDC said. The infecting organism,
Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3, was transferred from raw chitterlings
to the children mainly through contact with food preparers.
   The organism, present in many chitterlings, causes fever,
diarrhea and abdominal pain, the CDC said.
   The CDC advises that those preparing chitterlings should
carefully wash their hands before touching children or anything
used by children and avoid letting children touch the raw
chitterlings.

   The National Council of Churches voted
Friday to urge the United States to halt its military buildup in
the Persian Gulf and begin withdrawing troops from the region.
   The only U.S. troops that should stay are ``those which might be
required and explicitly recommended by the Security Council of the
United Nations,'' the church council said in a policy statement
approved at its convention.
   ``We stand at a unique moment in human history, when all around
us seemingly impregnable walls are being broken down and deep
historical enmities are being healed,'' the council said. ``And
yet, ironically, at such a moment our own nation seems to be poised
at the brink of war in the Middle East.''
   The council said President Bush and Congress should use every
means to try to reach a peaceful settlement in the Persian Gulf,
including direct negotiations with Iraq.
   The council also expressed support for the holding of a U.N.
international conference aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace in
the Middle East.
   And it reiterated its opposition to the withholding of food and
medicine from Iraq, but added that it generally supports the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
   The council urged Iraq to release immediately all foreigners
held against their will in Kuwait or Iraq and called on Iraq to
immediately withraw its troops from Kuwait.
   The vote came after the head of a group of Christian churches in
the Middle East urged the council to launch a united effort to seek
peace in the Middle East.
   ``Many people forget that Christianity came from the Middle
East,'' said Gabriel Habib, general secretary of the Middle East
Council of Churches. ``How can we say to other people, `Love each
other, live in peace,' if we don't have peace'' where Christianity
began.
   The Middle East Council is a sister group of the national
council, which represents more than 42 million members of
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations in the United States.
   Habib also urged President Bush to talk directly to Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein. Bush risks taking the blame for any war if he
appears unwilling to exhaust all peaceful ways to remove Iraqi
troops from Kuwait, Habib said.
   The best route to a settlement, he said, lies with the United
Nations because it involves a cooperative effort among all nations.
   In other business, the national council nominated a New York
City minister to become the first woman to lead the council since
it was founded 40 years ago.
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, 58, was chosen by a 29-member
search committee to become general secretary. She was formally
nominated for the post Wednesday. An election was expected to
approve the nomination Thursday or Friday.

<TEXT>
   About 4,500 workers at the three largest
San Francisco Bay area daily newspapers threatened to go on strike
Friday for the first time since the 1960s unless their pay increase
demands are met.
   Negotiators for the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco
Examiner, San Jose Mercury News and unions met Thursday with a
federal mediator to discuss a union demand for a 20 percent salary
boost.
   The newspapers, which together have a daily circulation of more
than 1 million, completed settlement of non-economic issues during
an all-night session.
   About a dozen unions, representing workers from reporters to
delivery drivers to press operators set a 5 p.m. Friday strike
deadline last week. Union leaders Thursday asked reporters to begin
withholding their bylines from stories as a show of solidarity.
   ``Our leverage on the newspaper is the holiday season when ad
revenues are usually up,'' said Nell Chethik, chairman of the
Newspaper Guild local for the Mercury News.
   Richard Jordan, chief negotiator for the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which prints the Examiner and Chronicle, said: ``I'm
confident we'll resolve this without a strike.''
   Doug Cuthbertson, chairman of the Conference of Newspaper
Unions, added, ``Time is runing short; It's going to be very
tough.''
   In New York, workers at the Daily News have been on strike since
Oct. 25.
   The News brought in replacement workers and as the shutdown
spread to include about 2,100 employees. The News has continued to
publish since the violence-plagued strike began, using replacement
workers, Newspaper Guild members who crossed picket lines and
management.
   Most of the Bay area unions have worked without a contract since
Feb. 2. Workers voted Oct. 29 to authorize a strike. The walkout
deadline was set Nov. 9 after management refused to consider the
union wage proposal for a 20 percent pay hike and four-day work
week.
   Cuthbertson said the request ``was high, but you've got to start
somewhere.'' Management had not made a salary proposal public but
``we won't be proposing any wage freeze either,'' Jordan said.
   The top scale for reporters at all three newspapers is $800 a
week.
   Knight-Ridder, a multi-media conglomerate that owns the Mercury
News, earned a profit last year of $247 million with the Pulitzer
prize-winning Mercury News accounting for about 25 percent,
analysts said.
   Revenue estimates weren't available for two San Francisco
newspapers, privately held by the Hearst and Thieriot families, but
the unions and an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. of Chicago, said
both are profitable.
   The previous three-year contract for all three newspapers gave
employees a 3 percent to 5 percent annual raise.
   John Hammett, a Mercury News senior vice president, said he was
speaking for all three newspapers and the initial union pay
increase proposal was outrageous.
   The morning Chronicle, weekday circulation of about 560,000,
publishes jointedly with the Examiner on Sunday for a combined
circulation of about 725,000. The afternoon Examiner has a weekday
circulation of about 138,000. The two 125-year-old papers entered
into a Joint Operating Agreement in 1965 with only the editorial
departments separate.
   The last San Francisco newspaper strike came in 1968 when the
Examiner and the Chronicle didn't publish for 55 days.
   The last strike at the San Jose Mercury News came in 1959 when
the paper didn't publish for four months. The newspaper has a daily
circulation of about 275,000 during the week and about 329,000 on
Sundays.

   Adolf Rudnicki, a leading Polish writer
and essayist known for his complex characters and his depictions of
Jews during the Holocaust, has died in Warsaw, PAP news agency
reported Thursday. He was 78.
   Rudnicki, whose works were translated into English, French,
Hebrew, German and Russian, died Wednesday.
   His novels include ``The Golden Windows'' and ``The Merchant of
Lodz,'' which focus on the theme of Jewish suffering and
resistance.
   Although his best known works were published after World War II,
Rudnicki gained an audience in Poland in the 1930s with his novels
``The Unloved,'' a psychological study of two people in love, and
``The Rats.''
   Rudnicki escaped being killed as a Jew under the Nazi occupation
and survived to fight in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. His wartime
experiences permeated his work.
   PAP. called his ``Epoch of the Ovens,'' a series of short
stories, ``one of the most explicit testimonies'' on the Holocaust,
in which about 6 million Jews were killed by Hitler's Germany.
   According to one survey of contemporary Polish culture: ``The
deepest aspect of Rudnicki's work is keeping faith with the
persecuted and their fate. ... Their fate, a sort of death
sentence, is shown in a biblical perspective - a chosen people and
a doomed people.''
   No information was immediately available on survivors or funeral
arrangements.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio said Thursday he will
cut 8 percent from the New Jersey budget this year instead of
waiting a year.
   The governor said results of the Nov. 6 election in New Jersey
showed him he needs to demonstrate state government will cut back
immediately if a $2.8 billion tax increase is to prove palatable.
   Florio's fellow Democrats performed poorly or lost on Election
Day, which analysts saw as a voter protest to the tax hike.
   The 8 percent cut will affect all 19 state departments and could
include layoffs, Florio said. He would not speculate on how many
layoffs could occur among the 87,000 state employees or which
departments, if any, might be eliminated.
   ``We need to accelerate that cutting process if we're going to
respond to the people's challenge,'' Florio said. ``We need to
start saving money right now and not just be talking about it.''
   Florio asked officials gathered for a luncheon of the New Jersey
League of Municipalities to keep local spending down in conjunction
with the state's effort to cut costs.
   Florio suggested regionalization, the combining of services
provided by separate localities, as one way of cutting expenses and
thus reducing property tax increases.
   ``Property taxes soared by 108 percent during the last decade,''
he said. ``That's intolerable. It destroys communities and drives
people out of the neighborhoods they helped build.''

<HEAD>Hal Holbrook Stars as King Lear</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hal Holbrook is a towering King Lear - an old
man who slips in and out of sanity but who never forgets that he is
king and accustomed to having every word obeyed.
   One doesn't see Holbrook or his portrayals of Mark Twain or Abe
Lincoln in Shakespeare's ``King Lear'' on the off-Broadway
Roundabout stage. One sees Lear.
   In the play, which opened Thursday, Holbrook's Lear sometimes
pulls himself back from madness through strength of will. His hand
shakes at moments of anxiety and he shouts with authority when he
has lost power.
   But when when Cordelia is killed, he lays her down, gently
smooths her hair and makes the audience share a parent's unbearable
pain at the death of a beloved child.
   The production, directed by Gerald Freedman, doesn't have a
static moment. Audience attention can't flag; somebody or something
on stage is always moving.
   The evening's second most interesting performance is by Margery
Murray as Regan. John Woodson is on target as the Earl of Kent,
disguised as a hearty servant of King Lear. Ron Randell is the
other unwise old father, Gloucester. Christopher McCann is a
sharp-beaked, bright-eyed chicken of a person as Lear's fool, Gary
Sloan properly insolent as Goneril's steward.
   The words explain the duplicity of Gloucester's son Edmund (John
Hutton) but one doesn't feel the evil personality underneath when
he's lying to his father. Edgar, the brother Edmund is trying to
kill, is called too good to suspect evil. But Michael James-Reed,
though he hops around effectively in Edgar's near-nude disguise as
Poor Tom, plays Edgar as too much of a wimp.
   Gloria Biegler looks right as Cordelia - the excellent costumes
are by Robert Wojewodski - but has a bit of debutante manner.
   Holbrook first played ``King Lear'' in May in Cleveland. The
play, which opens the Roundabout's 25th anniversary season, runs
here through Dec. 9. Peter Aylward, who has a small role in the
production, plays Lear at Wednesday matinees.

   Saddam Hussein said Thursday he would release
his foreign hostages only if President Bush promises not to attack
his country and claimed that he needs nuclear weapons to balance
what he said were Israel's.
   ``Such an open pledge of this nature - a declared statement of
this nature - would be sufficient for us to allow all foreigners to
leave Iraq,'' the Iraqi president said in an interview with ABC-TV.
   The Iraqi government says it is holding hundreds of foreigners
at strategic locations such as military installations to protect
against attack. Hundreds also have also been released
intermittently the past few months, many at the request of
individual envoys.
   Saddam, interviewed in a government guest house in Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital, said he regrets holding the hostages.
   ``This is the only decision which we have taken which rather
chokes us up,'' he said. ``Not for fear of anybody but out of this
sense of respect for humanity.''
   However, he again asserted that the hostages were his best
protection against attack.
   ``The only justification for this situtation is that the
presence of these people may help distract anybody who may opt for
war. It may make them hesitate a little before jumping into a
decision of this nature,'' he said.
   On other topics, Saddam was asked why he sought nuclear weapons.
``Because Israel is in possession of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons. And Israel is following a policy of expansion at
the expense of the Arabs,'' he replied through an interpreter.
   ``So the way we see it is that peace sometimes dictates for a
kind of balance to be drawn.''
   Iraq has made several attempts to acquire equipment and
technology useful for producing nuclear weapons. In two notable
instances, U.S. and British authorities blocked a shipment of
fast-acting electrical switches, and U.S. authorities seized
high-temperature ovens that authorities said could have been used
for nuclear devices.
   Though many analysts have concluded that Israel either has or
could quickly produce nuclear weapons, Israel has never admitted
having them and has said Israel will not be the first to introduce
them into the Middle east
   The Arab fight against Israel also formed the basis of Saddam's
defenseof sheltering two men accused of many terrorist attacks:
Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas.
   Though the two may make ``mistakes,'' he said, ``Our view of
them is different from the way we view the same mistakes made by
someone whose land has not been occupied ... These are freedom
fighters and not highwaymen.''
   Bush has been leading the international stand against Iraq's
Aug. 2 takeover of neighboring Kuwait. More than 300,000 soldiers
from 26 nations, including 230,000 from the United States, have
massed in the gulf region. Last week Bush ordered in another
200,000 U.S. soldiers.
   Asked whether he was willing to discuss the Mideast crisis with
other leaders, Saddam said: ``We have been ready all along.''
   As for dialogue with the United States, Saddam said he was
unwilling to meet Bush's demand that Iraq unconditionally withdraw
from Kuwait before any discussions.
   ``This is not dialogue. These are preconditions imposed to
insure our capitulation,'' he said. ``We reject such
preconditions.''
   Asked whether his position in Kuwait is negotiable, he said,
``When I say something I mean it.'' He did not elaborate.

   NASA lost contact with Magellan for 40
minutes Thursday, halting the spacecraft's Venus-mapping mission
for most of the day as a nagging malfunction resurfaced for the
third time in three months.
   Engineers sent new commands to the spacecraft, successfully
pointing its main antenna toward Earth so it could resume its $744
million mission to make radar pictures and maps of Venus, said
Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan normally loses contact with Earth during part of each
orbit of Venus. But shortly after 9 a.m. PST, a ground tracking
station failed to regain Magellan's radio signal, meaning contact
was lost completely, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said in a statement.
   Contact was restored 40 minutes later when engineers locked onto
a radio signal that gives them information about the spacecraft's
health.
   The main, dish-shaped antenna still was pointed away from Earth
by a scant 1{ degrees. The antenna must be aimed precisely at Earth
so Magellan's pictures of Venus can be transmitted to Earth at a
very high speed using a narrow-beam radio signal.
   Mapping was halted for most of the day until the new commands
made Magellan point its antenna properly. Mapping resumed Thursday
night.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. NASA lost
contact with the spacecraft for roughly 11 hours starting Aug. 16,
just hours after Magellan made its first test pictures of Venus.
Communications broke down for another 17 hours beginning Aug. 21.
   Engineers repeatedly warned they might lose touch with Magellan
again, but Thursday's blackout was the first since Magellan
formally started its map-making mission Sept. 15.
   ``I always get really worried about these things, but I know in
my heart we can expect this to happen, and it's going to happen
again,'' Saunders said, adding that the engineers ``deserve a lot
of praise'' for restoring contact with Magellan so quickly
Thursday.
   Engineers still haven't learned the cause of the previous radio
blackouts, but a similar event probably caused Thursday's loss of
contact, NASA said.
   However, Thursday's blackout lasted only a short time because of
improvements in Magellan's safety systems that were made following
the August breakdowns, NASA said.
   At the time of Thursday's malfunction, Magellan had orbited
Venus 713 times and made pictures of the planet during 338 of those
orbits, experiment representative Steve Wall said.

   A replacement Greyhound bus driver
who told passengers he hadn't ``killed anybody yet'' as the bus
hurtled across western Montana and northern Idaho has pleaded
guilty to inattentive driving.
   Nick F. Eisenbarth, 29, of Spokane had been scheduled to stand
trial Wednesday on a charge of reckless driving, but pleaded guilty
to the lesser offense in an arrangement with prosecutors.
   Eisenbarth was fined $300 and sentenced to two days in jail with
credit for one day served.
   The plea bargain was reached because all the witnesses were from
out of state and it would have been too expensive to bring them to
Idaho for Eisenbarth's trial, said Robyn Dvorak, Kootenai County
deputy prosecutor.
   Greyhound Lines fired Eisenbarth after learning of the incident,
which occurred July 19 on a run from Missoula, Mont., to Seattle, a
company official said. He was arrested after authorities were
tipped off by a passenger who got off the bus in Coeur d'Alene.
   The bus line's 6,000 drivers went on strike March 2 over a
dispute in wages and job security. Eisenbarth was hired as a
replacement driver.
   Kootenai County sheriff's deputies spotted the bus speeding west
from Coeur d'Alene. After following the bus for two miles, deputies
ordered it to pull over.
   Frightened passengers said Eisenbarth drove at speeds up to 80
mph.
   The bus nearly sideswiped several tractor-trailers, tailgated
slower-moving cars until they changed lanes and sped through a
tight curve along Lake Coeur d'Alene at 20 mph over the posted
speed limit, passengers said.
   Passengers also said the driver got the bus stuck in a driveway
and cursed riders who complained about his driving.
   ``I haven't killed anybody yet,'' he was quoted as saying.
   During the ride, Eisenbarth said he couldn't slow down because
he had to stick to his schedule, passengers told authorities.
   The bus arrived in Coeur d'Alene 30 minutes early, a police
report said.
   Four of the 38 passengers complained of back and neck injuries
after being tossed around during the three-hour ride.

   Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. said
Thursday it's entering the American luxury car market with the
Diamante sedan.
   The Diamante, named after the Spanish word for diamond, will be
an American version of the Mitsubishi Motors' Diamante sold in
Japan, spokesman Kim Custer said.
   The car will cost between $20,000 and $30,000, he said.
   The Diamante is expected in U.S. dealer showrooms in April 1991
as a 1992 model, Custer said. It will be available in two models,
both with V-6 powerplants.
   ``The Diamante will become Mitsubishi's flagship vehicle,
creating a desirable and affordable choice among luxury sedans for
the upscale buyer,'' said Richard Recchia, executive vice president
and chief operating officer.
   Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, based in Cypress, Calif., was
established in 1982 by Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Tokyo, and sells
subcompacts, compacts, sport coupes, light trucks and sport utility
vehicles.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is expected to circulate
a Security Council resolution by the end of November to authorize
collective U.N. force to drive Iraq from Kuwait, diplomats said
Thursday.
   A senior U.S. official traveling with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in Europe said if other nations react favorably to the
idea during a new round of consultations, the Bush administration
will seek such authority from the United Nations.
   However, Yevgeny Primakov, the Soviet Union's top Middle East
envoy, said later Thursday the world should do ``everything
possible'' to encourage Iraq to leave Kuwait, including agreeing to
hold talks on the Palestinian question.
   Primakov, speaking in New York, reiterated the Kremlin's desire
to avoid a military conflict in the Persian Gulf. He said Iraq
should be given the opportunity for a ``face-saving'' withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Baker is on a diplomatic trip to shore up support for such a
``use of force'' resolution with foreign ministers from countries
on the Security Council.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that ``no
decision has been made'' on submitting a resolution.
   However, the official with Baker said,``If what we hear is
favorable from the countries that have been contacted so far and
then the ones (that will be consulted), that would be enough for us
to make the decision to go forward.''
   He said the United States would like to introduce the resolution
this month while it still presides over the Security Council.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States ``was still awaiting responses from two major
countries.'' He declined to identify them.
   ``We are obviously not talking about something that would
involve a United Nations command of our forces,'' he added.
   The official said the resolution would ask for authority to use
force if peaceful measures fail.
   He spoke to reporters Thursday aboard Baker's plane to Brussels,
Belgium. A transcript of his remarks was made available there.
   Graham Green, first secretary at Canada's U.N. Mission, said of
a resolution authorizing force: ``You are likely to see it this
month, but probably with a reference to a time limit on letting
sanctions work.''
   Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier added, ``You don't need a road
map to envision an 11th resolution.''
   Other diplomats concurred with that assessment, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The United Nations has passed 10 resolutions directed against
Iraq since President Saddam Hussein's troops invaded tht small
emirate Aug. 2.
   The ideal timing would be for the United States to introduce the
resolution just before the month ends, and then press aggressively
for its adoption when it is no longer president.
   In December, the ambassador of Yemen, the only Arab member of
the council, assumes the presidency, followed by Zaire in January
and Zimbabwe in February.
   The United States and Soviet Union both have drawn up proposals
for a ``use of force'' resolution, diplomats in New York and
Washington officials say.
   European diplomats who have seen the Soviet document say it
would put heavy reliance on the so-far passive Military Staff
Committee of the Security Council. They spoke on condition of not
being identified.
   That committee's function, under the U.N. Charter, is to
``advise and assist'' on its military requirements, including ``the
employment and command of forces placed at its disposal.''
   Since America has the great majority of troops in a
multinational force now in the Persian Gulf, it would be likely to
dominate any command structure.
   Baker now is seeking consensus on when to use force, Green said.
   The secretary meets Saturday in Geneva with the foreign
ministers of Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Zaire, all Security Council
members.
   Last week he lined up the Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France - permanent members of the Council who could have vetoed the
resolution.
   Baker flies to Paris to meet Sunday with the foreign ministers
of Romania and Finland, two more council members, and meet again
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Egypt, Turkey and the exiled
government of Kuwait assured Baker during his recent trip to the
gulf and Europe that they would not oppose the resolution.

   The FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes
and was checking whether they are related to the Manuel Noriega
recordings at the center of a court battle. The network protested
the tapes were obtained without a warrant.
   Cable News Network said the tapes were in a box of materials
related to the Noriega case that was removed from a hotel room that
had been occupied by one of its reporters. The room was in the Omni
Hotel, which is part of a complex that houses CNN's offices.
   It was not immediately clear whether the tapes taken were audio
recordings or videotapes. CNN President Tom Johnson and CNN chief
counsel Steve Korn said they didn't know the contents of the box.
FBI spokesman Scott Nelson confirmed that authorities obtained CNN
tapes without a subpoena, but he didn't know what kind of tapes
they were.
   ``We were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for
analysis,'' Nelson said.
   The network demanded that the materials be returned.
   CNN is seeking to overturn a federal judge's order blocking it
from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed
Panamanian dictator Noriega and his lawyers.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the complex, had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, the network said.
   The network said the FBI had no warrant and acted over the
objections of a CNN attorney who was present when the material was
taken by the agents. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a warrant
and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a warrant.''
   Johnson said he personally protested the FBI's action ``in the
strongest terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   The network said a Turner Security official called the FBI
because agents had told him they were looking for ``stolen
government property.'' The network said the material was not
stolen.
   Hotel security officers, believing that CNN reporter Marlene
Fernandez had vacated the hotel room, removed the box Monday and
turned it over to Turner Security, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said.
   Turner Security returned the box to the hotel security office on
Thursday and then brought FBI agents to the office and gave them
the box, according to Haworth and hotel officials.
   The box contained some papers and at least one videotape, said
Omni General Manager Bill Thompson, who saw the box handed over to
the FBI.
   Johnson said ``it's in dispute'' whether the room was vacated by
Fernandez, who normally anchors CNN's Spanish-language telecasts in
Washington but had been working on the Noriega case.
   Haworth also said ``the people who needed to know did not know''
that Turner Security, another subsidiary of CNN's parent firm
Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., had the box of materials in its
possession.
   The New York Times, citing a CNN source who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the tapes taken were not the Noriega tapes.
``The FBI did not get the main course,'' he said.
   The tapes at the center of the court battle are recordings of
phone conversations between Noriega and his lawyers. On Nov. 8,
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami barred CNN from
broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until
Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger
Noriega's right to a fair trial by compromising privileged
attorney-client discussions.
   CNN has refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler. On Thursday,
the network asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Anthony M. Kennedy,
to let it broadcast the Noriega-lawyer tapes.
   Earlier this week, lawyers for CNN and Noriega struck an
agreement under which the network will not broadcast tapes of
Noriega talking to his lawyers until receiving some word from the
Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state they are
talking to their lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include
conversations between Noriega and his defense team.

   Yevgeny Primakov, the top Soviet envoy for the
Middle East, said Thursday the world should do ``everything
possible'' to encourage Iraq to leave Kuwait peacefully, including
agreeing to talks on the Palestinian question.
   Primakov, a member of the Presidential Council that advises
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, reiterated the Kremlin's
desire to avoid a military conflict in the Persian Gulf. He said
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein should be given the opportunity for a
``face-saving'' withdrawal from Kuwait.
   But ``it's very difficult to make a distinction between
face-saving and rewarding him,'' he said at a news conference
before receiving an award from the Citizens Exchange Council for
promoting better U.S.-Soviet relations.
   In a later speech to the council, Primakov proposed a ``flexible
linkage'' between Iraq's withdrawal and a conference to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   ``We could inform him about our intentions to take steps toward
an international conference,'' he said.
   Saddam has demanded that a withdrawal from Kuwait be linked to
establishment of a Palestinain homeland. President Bush has
rejected placing specific conditions for an Iraqi withdrawal but
said other issues could be discussed after a pullout.
   Bush recently has bolstered U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, saying
the troops must be capable of launching an offensive action. U.S.
officials say they intend to add about 200,000 soldiers to the
230,000 already there.
   The Soviet Union is the past has indicated it might approve of
military action against Iraqi forces under a U.N. command if
peaceful measures fail.
   But Primakov said Thursday that ``we must do everything possible
to force a withdrawal ... everything in our power for a political
solution.
   ``The alternative is a military solution that would have
terrible consequences,'' not only in loss of life but in further
destabilizing the region, said Primakov, who has made two trips to
Baghdad to meet with Iraqi officials.
   As part of arranging a political solution to the gulf crisis,
Primakov also proposed establishing a ``scheme of regional
security'' that would include limits on Iraq's chemical weapons
arsenal and the withdrawal of the multinational military force
opposing Iraq.
   Meanwhile, the United States is expected to circulate a U.N.
Security Council resolution by the end of November to authorize
collective U.N. force to drive Iraq from Kuwait, diplomats said
Thursday.
   In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Primakov
said the Security Council should not be pushed into adopting such a
resolution while negotiations with Iraq are being pursued.
   Iraq invaded its tiny, oil-rich neighbor on Aug. 2 in a dispute
over oil, money and land.

   Congressional Democrats are counseling
President Bush to give international sanctions against Iraq as much
as 18 months to take effect before considering military moves in
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   At a White House meeting Wednesday, House Speaker Thomas Foley
and others asked Bush to be patient. Foley suggested that the
economic embargo may take many months longer to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, according to a senior congressional source.
   Afterward, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., issued
a statement calling for ``a policy of patient strength, permitting
the economic sanctions ... to work.''
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said, ``I'm terribly worried about
the direction they're going'' in the administration.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Thrift regulators are demanding a record $6.8
billion from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for alleged junk bond
fraud. The collapsed investment firm says it's being made a
scapegoat for the savings and loan debacle.
   The claims filed in federal Bankruptcy Court on Wednesday accuse
Drexel and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, of
``plundering'' more than 40 failed thrifts through racketeering,
fraud, bribery and numerous other crimes.
   The allegations brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp. are by far the largest damages
sought in the S&amp;L crisis, which is expected to cost taxpayers more
than $500 billion over 30 years.
   They also, for the first time, pin much of the blame for the
crisis on Drexel.

   LONDON (AP) - When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher set off to a
European summit in Rome last month, it looked like business as
usual: another spat with the continentals, more ``Maggie Isolated''
headlines, and home.
   But the Oct. 27 meeting of the European Community leaders was
for Mrs. Thatcher the crest of a slippery slope, and provoked the
most serious challenge to her leadership through 11 years in power.
   Now Mrs. Thatcher is fighting for her political survival.
   Former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine announced Wednesday
that he will challenge her on Tuesday for the leadership of the
Conservative Party and the prime ministership.
   Things of course had not gone that wrong that quickly for the
Iron Lady.
   The crisis is a culmination of economic troubles at home and a
questioning of what was once a major Thatcher asset - the gritty
nationalism she calls ``batting for Britain.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - To celebrate the 300th anniversary of
newspaper journalism in America, historians took a look at this
country's first newspapers and found them to be bad role models:
elitist, racist, venomous, biased and worshipful of kings.
   ``Outrageously partisan,'' is how David Paul Nord, associate
professor of journalism at Indiana University, characterized them
at a day-long discussion on the roots of the American press
Wednesday.
   And troublemaking. When the people of this continent looked for
``treason, sedition, fragmentation, dissension, disintegration,
degeneration, disunion, anarchy or chaos,'' he said, ``they usually
saw it first in the newspaper.''
   He said the New York Evening Post, forerunner of today's New
York Post, was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton's faction of
the Federalist Party for a single purpose: to destroy Thomas
Jefferson, who won the presidency in the election of 1800.

   WESTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) - Complaining that the selection process
too often puts personality ahead of grades, some high schools
around the country are dropping or considering eliminating their
National Honor Society chapters.
   Hampshire Regional High School last week joined those that have
withdrawn from the 22,000-chapter NHS, a program that high school
students with a ``B'' average have listed on their college
appliations for the past 70 years.
   The school complained that entrance requirements of character,
leadership and service are too subjective
   ``Too often selection becomes a matter of personality,'' said
Deborah Niswonger, chairwoman of the school board that oversees
645-student Hampshire High. She said the non-scholastic criteria
rule out too many ``serious students.''

   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - It used to be that couples striving for
parenthood said so with a blush and a demure ``We're trying.'' Now
three Iowa couples are forgoing such niceties in a radio contest to
see who conceives first.
   ``It's not really anything different than what other people do,
it's just that we're telling the whole world that we're trying to
have kids,'' said Roger Fouche.
   Fouche is one of three husbands entered in the Breeders Cup
contest sponsored by KRNQ-FM, which has offered prizes to the first
couple to conceive. A similar competition is being run by a radio
station in Pensacola, Fla.
   The Iowa contestants' efforts are being performed behind closed
doors, thank goodness. But every Friday morning the couples go on
the air to talk about their experiences, and the women take
pregnancy tests at the station.

<HEAD>High-Definition TV Producers Talk About the New Medium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An infinite series of rooms rolls by. A man and
woman levitate in the vaulted interior of the Chartres cathedral
and wheel in a somber, aerial pas de deux. M.C. Escher's
mathematical illusions come to life.
   These images are the hyperreality of high-definition television,
or HDTV, and it's here, now, so you'd better get used to being
massaged by a new medium.
   HDTV pictures are alive, stunning in the complexity of their
color and detail. Somewhere, Marshall McLuhan is laughing.
Television, the ``cool'' medium with its low-resolution picture, is
suddenly very, very ``hot.''
   ``There's a sense of being there, a sense of `now-ness,' a
certain believability about it that film or television just can't
do,'' said David Niles, a New York City-based producer who
specializes in HDTV.
   ``We're really sure now that we're looking at a whole new
medium, not just better television, better cinema,'' Niles said.
``The way that you see it is totally different.''
   ``We don't know too much about perception with this
technology,'' said Zbigniew Rybczynmski, a video artist based in
Hoboken, N.J., and winner of an Academy Award for his short film
``Tango.''
   ``The technology is a lot more than big television,'' said Barry
Rebo, who heads the first HDTV production company in the United
States. ``We're not in the television business,'' he said. ``We're
in the wide-screen, high-definition imaging business.''
   The work of these men and their collaborators is on exhibit at
the Museum of Broadcasting here through Nov. 24. They and their
works are at the cutting edge of a new technology whose owner's
manual still is being written.
   It boils down to resolution, the horizontal lines that
constitute a video image. A standard TV picture has 330 lines. A
typical VHS videocassette recorder has 240 lines - that's why VHS
images have a ``soft'' look.
   A top-of-the line Super VHS VCR or a LaserVision disc player put
out 425 lines of resolution. That's about 60 percent sharper than
VHS. The most advanced TV monitor you can buy displays about 700
lines of resolution.
   An HDTV signal is at least 1,125 lines of resolution, formated
with the 16:9 ``wide-screen'' aspect ratio, instead of the 4:3
proportions of our comfy old boob tube.
   In addition, the high-resolution electronic image is much easier
to manipulate than film or videotape. Special effects can get
spectacularly surreal.
   ``Since high definition is so new, there really aren't any rules
about what you can or can't do,'' said Niles.
   The analogy is that HDTV is to conventional TV as old-time
silent movies are to today's giant-screen theatrical movies shot on
70mm stock.
   That analogy breaks down, however, when cinema and TV
technicians try to use the new technology. As media maestro McLuhan
prophesied, eyes accustomed to the old media have trouble adjusting
to the new.
   ``It takes a long time to learn how to make high definition.
Simple things like making people laugh or scaring them is different
on high definition,'' Niles said. ``The jokes are bigger in
high-definition television. Timing that worked on television
doesn't work in high definition.''
   HDTV's startling reality leads to an unwilling suspension of
disbelief, a lessening of the intellectual distance between the
viewer and what is viewed, Niles said.
   ``It's changing the way you tell a story,'' he said. ``It
becomes more impressionistic, like something you dream.''
   Elsewhere in the world, HDTV is a multibillion-dollar industry.
   Japan's NHK, the national broadcasting company, airs a daily
hour of HDTV programming and is gearing up for eight hours a day.
   There are 78 high-definition theaters in Japan. The United
States has none, but Niles, who has refurbished New York's old Ed
Sullivan Theater, said he'll open an HDTV theater there with a
40-foot screen within months.
   ``Right now I can count on two hands the number of
high-definition producers in the world,'' Niles said. In the United
States, there are six and their output is small, he said.
   Here, HDTV is a buzzword for the United States' ceding to Japan
the leadership in electronic technology and consumer goods. That
was a decision made by U.S. industry and it's not really the
problem, Niles and Rebo said.
   ``We've made such a political battle out of it that the public
has a perception of high definition that is more myth than
reality,'' Niles said.
   ``Who's going to make the TV sets?'' he said. ``Who cares? Who's
going to make the programming? ... That's important.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   `AMERICAN CHRONICLES' TACKLES HEF: The life and times of Hugh
Marston Hefner, the man who created Playboy magazine in 1954, are
the subject of Saturday night's ``American Chronicles'' on Fox
Broadcasting Co.
   For the generation of American males who grew up within
Playboy's fantasy, it's good to see how well Hef has aged. For the
American woman, there's not much of interest here.
   There's an interview with Hefner that reveals very little.
There's footage and stills of him in younger days, remarkable
mostly for the startling style changes in hair, makeup and ladies'
foundation garments.
   Like Playboy and Hefner, the program is saucy in its use of
attractive young women in varying states of undress. And, like
Playboy and Hef, it is sadly irrelevant to the sporadic firefights
of the waning Sexual Revolution.

<HEAD>Recession: An Invisible Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is discussed somberly and ominously and
anticipated as if it were an impending earthquake or volanic
eruption. But when it actually occurs it provides no sign of any
sort by which it may be recognized.
   It is recession, a subject that would leave a gaping hole in
news reports if it couldn't be forecast, discussed, warned about or
looked back on. But when it comes and when it goes nobody knows,
and it makes no difference anyway.
   Yet, if there were an economic question of the day, so to speak,
the question of whether we're in a recession would win by default.
No other economic question is posed more often, or more often left
unanswered.
   Making the situation even harder to understand is that the
questions and the answers really have little or no significance
other than to satisfy the nagging desire for perfection in a very
imperfect economic science.
   The word ``recession'' is really just a technical word for a
weakened economy. It is not a scientific term in the same sense as,
for instance, superconductivity or hypertension, two other terms
used quite often today.
   It is very important to almost everyone when the economy
weakens. There is no question about that. But it matters little to
everyone or even anyone that the economy has crossed a somewhat
arbitrary line and entered recession.
   The definition most often used in declaring a recession to exist
is when the total output of goods and services, the so-called gross
national product, shrinks for two straight three-month periods.
   Using that definition, you are of course in recession before you
realize it, but so what? All along you might have thought the
economy was merely weak, as indicated by your paycheck, your job
security, your company's declining profits, your neighbor's layoff,
the decline of state tax revenues and so on.
   And, essentially, you were correct. The mere passing of a
technical line on the way down didn't change the economy a bit; it
didn't alter its appearance or its ingredients or make it any
better or any worse. Not at all.
   What it might have done is please those who had forecast a
recession was coming, displease those who said it wasn't, satisfied
economic technicians who made the discovery, endangered the
political future of some elected officials.
   But, unless the decline was abrupt, the declaration that a
recession existed probably had no greater impact on your wallet
than a comparable, non-recessionary economic weakening.
   The occasion leaves not a trace. There is no great change in the
month-to-month appearance or performance of an economy still
advancing at an annual rate of one-tenth of one percent and one
declining by the same amount.
   Crossing the recessionary line is a non-event, an odd contrast
to all the hulaballoo that precedes it. Far more important is
whether the decline continues and for how long, and whether it
deepens or weakens.
   Events on the way up from recession are similar. Nobody really
knows that the line is crossed until months afterward. And nobody
should really care. The important thing is that growth has resumed.

<HEAD>Winds of Freedom Blow for Cuban Jazz Trumpeter</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's only 90 miles from Cuba to Florida, but
it's taken Cuban jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval thousands of miles
- and many years - to make that short trip between two different
worlds.
   Considered Cuba's foremost jazz artist, Sandoval defected while
on tour in Italy with Dizzy Gillespie's United Nation Orchestra. He
turned up at the U.S. Embassy in Rome on July 22 with a small
suitcase and trumpet, requesting political asylum.
   At the same time, his wife, Marianela, and 14-year-old son,
Arturo Jr., who had been allowed to join him in Europe, sought
asylym at the American Embassy in London. Within days, they were
settled in Miami, with its large Cuban population.
   ``I didn't want my son to grow up there with all the problems,''
Sandoval said. ``The principle thing is to feel free. ... That's
No. 1.
   ``One of my dreams in life has been to come here to the United
States - the land of jazz, the music that I love.''
   As a jazz artist, Sandoval suffered for playing America's
indigenous music in a country whose communist government is
staunchly anti-Yankee. While performing his compulsory military
service almost 20 years ago, he was imprisoned for four months
after he was caught listening to a U.S. jazz broadcast.
   ``They said I was a jazz lover which meant that I was
pro-American,'' Sandoval said, in a telephone interview from his
home in Miami.
   ``I felt that I was losing my life, my time and my talent,
because there were so few opportunities to play,'' he said.
   Since coming to the United States, the 41-year-old Sandoval is
furiously making up for lost time.
   He has formed his own sextet with Cuban-American musicians in
Miami, and is currently touring Europe again with Dizzy's
multinational big band. He recorded a trumpet solo for Dave
Grusin's soundtrack for ``Havana,'' the soon-to-be released film
about 1950s Cuba starring Robert Redford.
   In March, he plans to perform a Haydn trumpet concerto with the
London Festival Orchestra. He also has appeared with the BBC
Symphony in London and the Leningrad Symphony.
   But what distinguishes him is his Latin-style jazz trumpet,
blending blazing Afro-Cuban and salsa rhythms with bebop
influences, spiced with ear-bursting high-note playing.
   On a recent Monday night in New York, Sandoval's cheeks puffed
out and turned bright red as he hit stratospheric notes in guest
appearances with two fellow Cuban expatriates, veteran conga player
Mongo Santamaria and saxophonist Paquito d' Rivera at the Village
Gate.
   Standing backstage enjoying the proceedings was Gillespie, 73,
who befriended Sandoval during a visit to Cuba in the 1970s and
later introduced him to American audiences.
   ``He's one of the real phenomenons of these times. ... He's
unbelievable; it's a pleasure to work with the guy,'' Gillespie
said of his younger protege.
   ``He's the definitive Cuban trumpeter of the 1990s. He has that
real Cuban soul ... and he has the knowledge of the work of all the
major trumpet players of the last 40 or 50 years.''
   Gillespie is widely credited with pioneering the marriage of
jazz and Afro-Cuban music when he recruited the legendary Cuban
conga player Chano Pozo to play in his bebop big band in 1947.
   Sandoval was born in 1949 in the town of Artemisa, about 30
miles outside Havana. His father was a car mechanic, his mother a
housewife. At the age of 12, he began playing trumpet in his town's
marching brass band, often performing at political rallies in the
early days of the Cuban revolution.
   His life changed when he heard a 1947 bebop recording featuring
Dizzy and saxophonist Charlie ``Bird'' Parker.
   ``It was around 1964,'' Sandoval recalled. ``I got crazy when I
heard that. ... I said it's impossible to play like that. That
bebop music infected me in my brain.
   ``Dizzy will be my hero forever. I admire him as a genius
musician and a great person. ... To play with him and have the
chance of being his friend is the most important thing that has
happened in my life.''
   But it wasn't easy for Sandoval to pursue his passion for jazz.
There was no jazz on the radio, and the U.S. trade embargo and
travel restrictions made records hard to come by.
   He and a small circle of friends shared the treasured jazz
recordings brought back by the occasional traveler to the West, and
he managed to be influenced by Louis Armstrong, Clifford Brown,
Woody Shaw, Miles Davis and other American jazz trumpeters.
   Sandoval studied classical trumpet at the National School of Art
in Havana, and in the late 1960s began performing with the Cuban
Orchestra of Modern Music, using it as a cover to play some jazz.
   In 1973, after completing his army service, he joined d'Rivera
and other young musicians in founding Irakere, a seminal band which
modernized the link between jazz and Cuban music, using electronic
instruments along with traditional Cuban drums. The Grammy-winning
band became one of Cuba's most popular musical exports, winning
acclaim in Europe and the United States.
   Sandoval left Irakere in 1981 to form his own jazz group because
he wanted to play more of his own compositions. The Ministry of
Culture gave him little support, because it wanted him to stay in
Irakere.
   ``I had to fight for everything, even getting the instruments
was hard,'' he said. The government buys instruments and parcels
them out among preferred musicians; Sandoval had to buy most of his
equipment abroad.
   Sandoval planned his escape for years, stashing some of his
possessions with friends in Europe whenever he had the opportunity
to tour. But he waited for the opportunity to get his wife and son
out of Cuba before defecting.
   Before he began a six-month European tour in May, he told the
Ministry of Culture he wouldn't go - and they would lose their
share of his earnings - unless his family could join him for a
vacation.
   The Cuban government reacted to his defection by issuing a
statement: ``In times of danger, rats abandon the ship to drown
themselves in a sea of infinite shame.''
   Sandoval is trumpeting his freedom, vowing to blow harder than
ever now that he has the chance to play his music anywhere he
wants.
   ``I play with all my head and my heart,'' said Sandoval. ``I put
all my life into the hole of the mouthpiece. I explore my life
through my trumpet.
   ``When I play, I always think I'm going to die the next day, so
I put out everything I've got.''

<HEAD>Former Red Cross Worker Helps Restore War's Ruins</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   George Esper, who covered the Vietnam War for
The Associated Press from 1965 until its end in 1975, interviewed
former Red Cross worker Cherie Rankin before her return to Vietnam.
Here are her reflections of her journey into the past.

   Like a growing number of Americans who
served in Vietnam, Cherie Rankin returned there after 20 years to
help rebuild a small part of what the war destroyed.
   In doing so, she also restored a part of her life.
   ``I think what it means is there's been enough distance from the
trauma to make it safe for people to deal with it,'' she said. ``It
means relations between our two countries are going to improve.''
   For six weeks, Ms. Rankin, a former Red Cross worker, labored in
the punishing sun mixing mortar to help build a medical clinic near
Hanoi destroyed by U.S. bombers.
   At the end of October, she came home to the United States for
the second time, a ``twice-in-a-lifetime experience.'' She cried
for the living she left behind this trip. The last time, in 1971,
it was for the dead.
   Two decades ago, she brought back with her the images of war,
orphans scorched by napalm and blinded by bombs. This time, she
came back with images of carefree, curious, clinging children who
followed her wherever she went.
   Returning home, she clutched a hat full of love: the conical hat
her Vietnamese co-workers signed as a remembrance on the day the
clinic was finished and they parted with warm embraces and tears.
   ``There was a lot of crying that day,'' she recalled.
   In a sense, her return was part of a broader pilgrimage by
Americans in recent years. Their return is a sentimental journey, a
reconnecting with their past, when they were young men and women
undergoing a transcendent experience.
   Ms. Rankin was only 24 then. For more than 10 years after she
came home the first time in September 1971 after a year's tour,
thinking about Vietnam made her sick to her stomach. She threw up
at a reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984.
   Today, at age 44, she said Vietnam revisited has probably
exorcised the demons from her mind that even counseling couldn't
capture. Ms. Rankin herself is a psychotherapist.
   ``I think it has probably put a closure on it in a way that it
hadn't before,'' she said. ``I probably will never use the word
`resolve.' It's not something I want to have resolved. I don't ever
want to forget the pain of the war because I might become
complacent about war.''
   Her return helped change the images in her mind of napalmed
babies, starving children and the poverty and sadness she read in
the faces of the Vietnamese when she was there two decades before.
   ``What I see now is ... happy children, sparkle and twinkles in
the eyes of the people going on with their lives,'' Ms. Rankin
said. ``There's still incredible poverty, but it's not so dirty.
They're not starving because they grow their own food and are able
to do that now.
   ``They still don't have things, still live in small homes and
they don't have access to good medical care. But it's not the same
kind of thing that happened during the war when they were displaced
from their ancestral roots and their agricultural attachment to the
land.''
   Ms. Rankin was part of a group of seven American civilians and
military veterans who paid their own way to Vietnam to build badly
needed medical facilities. They were the third team of Americans to
return under the auspices of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration
Project in Garberville, Calif.
   Only non-governmental American organizations can give Vietnam
humanitarian aid since the two governments have no diplomatic
relations and the United States has imposed a trade embargo on the
country.
   Ms. Rankin said most of the Vietnamese expressed interest in
restoring relations so there could be free trade, communications
and travel.
   ``They really are puzzled by our continued boycott of them and
they were constantly in wonder of us,'' she said. ``It was
impossible to walk down the street without being surrounded by
adults as well as children.
   ``I think that I - and it's probably true for the other veterans
that went with me - represented something bigger to the Vietnamese.
The people we met saw us as representatives of our government. So
there was a sense ... that things were softening. ... Fifteen years
is long enough to hold a grudge.''
   Kevin Bowen, a veteran and co-director of The William Joiner
Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, said Americans returning to
Vietnam are finding it a way of healing some of the mental wounds
of the war.
   ``I think for veterans in this country, it's important to get
this episode behind us,'' said Bowen, who has made five trips back
to Vietnam. ``We need to have different relations with Vietnam and
with our past and not an angry, vindictive relationship. We're not
just punishing Vietnam. We're punishing ourselves.''
   Ms. Rankin returned to Vietnam with the intention of mourning
the men whose hands she held as they lay dying and the Vietnamese
orphans she embraced - the blind, the legless, the retarded.
   She had detached herself from her feelings during the war in
order to do the job of building morale among the GIs.
   This time, work got in her way.
   ``I didn't really have a lot of time,'' she said. ``The work was
very exhausting. We also had a lot of demands on our after-hours
time, going to meet their governing bodies, to functions and to
cultural events.''
   But she cried when she said goobye to her Vietnamese friends at
the clinic and when she visited the grounds of the Sacred Heart
Orphanage in Da Nang, where she had tended the children in her free
time.
   The orphanage was almost exactly as she remembered it. But the
children had been moved to another home south of Da Nang. In one of
the many ironies of Vietnam, Sacred Heart now is home for old
people who have nobody, their children killed in the war.
   After the clinic was built, Ms. Rankin spent two more weeks in
Vietnam. She retraced her wartime steps in what was then South
Vietnam, basking in the moments that almost seemed unreal - and
remembering.
   The sites stepped out of history to meet her: Marble Mountain,
Monkey Mountain, China Beach.
   She recognized them all.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gloom has replaced the euphoria
that enveloped Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution a year ago.
Economic worries abound and Slovak nationalism threatens to split
the country.
   Ordinary people are fearful without the economic security the
old communist system provided. Economists forecast that
unemployment and inflation will rise rapidly as the nation converts
to capitalism.
   President Vaclav Havel, the former dissident playwright who
personified the ``velvet revolution,'' has acknowledged the
national malaise.
   ``A question is looming over this state: whether it is dying due
to its own faults,'' he said in a television speech Oct. 28, the
72nd anniversary of Czechoslovakia's birth. ``We do not have too
many reasons to be satisfied.''
   Such national uncertainty has seldom been matched since the
Czechs and Slovaks joined in 1918, after centuries of domination by
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to create Czechoslovakia.
   The two nations were separated by the Nazis during World War II,
and afterward, Czechoslovakia spent 40 years as part of the Soviet
bloc.
   Now, with the disintegration of the communist empire, Slovak
separatism is resurgent and the threat of another separation has
become real.
   Slovaks make up about one-third of the 15.5 million people and
occupy the more rural eastern part of Czechoslovakia. Under the
centralized communist government, nearly all Slovak affairs were
decided in Prague, the federal capital.
   Discord between Czechs and Slovaks seemed non-existent a year
ago; they filled the streets together to bring down the old regime.
   Czechoslovakia's revolution began Nov. 17. 1989, when police
brutally beat thousands of students demonstrating for more rapid
democratic change of the kind that was transforming Poland, Hungary
and East Germany.
   The police brutality inspired street protests that toppled the
Communist Party Politburo seven days later. Before the end of the
year, Havel and fellow dissidents were in power.
   Havel visited several countries in the ensuing months. Back
home, the mood remained euphoric, with rising crime and increasing
nationalism seen as relatively minor problems accompanying the
revolution.
   Because about 5 million Czechoslovaks were at least indirectly
beholden to the communists, the interim government's campaign
against the party was not entirely successful.
   In elections June 8, Havel's Civic Forum and Public Against
Violence, its Slovak sister organization, won 57 percent of the
vote. The turnout was 97 percent.
   The first economic shocks came after the elections. Food prices
were raised, gasoline prices went up 50 percent and train fares
doubled. Disillusionment spread and many people had a sense of
betrayal.
   ``We disregard our everyday worries for the sake of discussing
privatization ... leaving the spiritual values aside,'' Daniela
Kolarova, an actress and member of Parliament, said earlier this
year. ``We keep hearing the argument that, once the economy starts
functioning, there will be time for the soul.''
   Slovak nationalists have held mass demonstrations for months. In
mid-November, thousands of Slovaks marched in Bratislava, capital
of Slovakia, demanding secession. They were angered by their
regional government's efforts to reach agreement on power sharing
with the Czech and fed administrations.
   Some members of the Slovak parliament also have demanded a
separate nation.
   The resurgent Slovak separatism cast a cloud over the 72nd
anniversary ceremonies and led Havel to appeal for cooperation.
   ``I believe our reason, our sense of togetherness, our
responsibility, culture as well as the instinct for
self-preservation will prevail,'' he said in the televised address.
   Some people old enough to remember the two separate nations seem
to be preparing for the memory to become reality again.
   ``It just may be that the end of the communist excursion into
history could bring the end of the Czechoslovak experiment, too,''
a 78-year old Czech told a reporter who asked his opinion.

<HEAD>Arms Cuts Will Erase European Fear of Surprise Attack</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 5th graf to CORRECT Friday to Thursday</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A landmark arms treaty cutting non-nuclear
forces in Europe is far from the final step in disarmament, but it
offers one overarching reward: the end to fear of a massive
surprise ground attack.
   It also may open the way for the eventual elimination of U.S.
and Soviet nuclear weapons from Europe, some analysts believe,
although that issue is strongly debated.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe, or CFE, treaty scheduled to
be signed Monday in Paris alters the military balance in Europe
mainly by erasing Moscow's ability to mass huge numbers of tanks
and other heavy armor in central Europe.
   ``It is the definitive end of the surprise attack option'' for
the Soviets, said Jonathon Dean, a former U.S. representative to
East-West conventional arms negotiations.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators in Vienna reached tentative
agreement Thursday on the last details, diplomats said.
   Hungary's chief negotiator, Ambassador Istvan Gyarmati, said the
last minor disagreements were worked out at a plenary meeting of
the 22 nations belonging to the two military alliances.
   Other diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
a tentative agreement had been reached.
   From the start of the Cold War and the creation first of NATO in
1949 and then the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance, the military
landscape of Western Europe has been dominated by fear of a ``bolt
from the blue'' communist-bloc ground assault.
   To eliminate that perceived threat, the CFE treaty - limiting
the weapons of 22 countries and covering European territory from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains - requires the Soviets to
drastically reduce their forces, includin:
   - Tanks, from about 41,000 before the treaty negotiations began
in 1989 to 13,150. Moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in
the territory covered by the treaty to about 21,000, mainly by
moving its best models east as replacements for older ones.
   The allowable number tanks for all of Eastern Europe will be
20,000. The United States and its NATO allies also will be allowed
20,000 tanks. That will require a cut of about 4,000 for NATO,
although more than 1,000 of the top-of-the-line American M1-A1
tanks already are being moved from Europe to Saudi Arabia.
   - Armored combat vehicles, from the 32,300 now deployed by the
Soviets to 20,000. NATO will not have to make any cuts in this
category, which includes such war-fighting machinery as the U.S.
Bradley Fighting Vehicle used to move infantry, protect maneuvering
tanks and help consolidate gains in an offensive.
   - Artillery pieces, providing the essential firepower for a
combat operation, from about 52,000 for the Soviets before the CFE
negotiations began, to 13,175. The Soviets already have reduced to
18,300. NATO will stay at its current level of 18,500.
   Those three weapon categories - tanks, armored combat vehicles
and artillery - are especially important to the military balance in
Europe because they form the core of non-nuclear offensive
capability for both the Soviets and NATO.
   Once the treaty is implemented, neither side will be able to
marshal enough firepower within striking range of the other to
launch a land invasion without setting off warning bells months, or
even years, in advance, analysts say.
   Because most of the cuts will be made by the Soviets, no
significant cost savings will be felt immediately by the NATO
countries, according to the Institute for Defense and Disarmament
Studies, a research group based at Brookline, Mass.
   The treaty does not include cuts in military personnel in
Europe. A U.S.-Soviet agreement last February to limit each side to
195,000 foreign troops in central Europe, plus an additional 30,000
U.S. troops elsewhere in Europe, has been abandoned. The plan was
overtaken by events, including the Soviets' declared intent to
withdraw all their forces from central Europe within four years,
the newly unified Germany's agreement to limit the size of its
armed forces, and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact as a coherent
military force.
   Just last month Washington announced it would unilaterally
withdraw 40,000 troops from Western Europe and close some of its
bases there. Then on Nov. 8, President Bush ordered about 100,000
U.S. Army combat forces from Europe to Saudi Arabia as
reinforcements against Iraq. That cuts U.S. Army strength in Europe
by one-half, although it was presumed that some of those troops
would later return to Europe.
   Most of the weapons to be withdrawn from Europe under the CFE
treaty will be destroyed, although the treaty permits some to be
converted to non-military or military support purposes.
   Neither the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact partners nor the
United States and its NATO allies will be required to destroy any
attack helicopters limited by the treaty. Those in excess of the
2,000 permitted by the treaty can be converted to noncombat roles.
   For other combat aircraft, the Soviets will be required to
eliminate about one-third of their inventory in the area covered by
the treaty. No cuts are required of the NATO countries because they
already are well below the treaty limit of 6,800 combat aircraft.

<HEAD>Wendie Jo Sperber Sheds Reluctance About Leading Role in `Babes'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendie Jo Sperber had misgivings about taking
the leading part in the Fox Network's ``Babes'': She's always been
a supporting player, and it was the first time her weight had any
bearing on a role.
   The series, about three overweight sisters sharing an apartment,
began with a heavy emphasis on fat jokes, but has become the story
of three women who could be any size, trying to juggle their lives
and relationships in close quarters.
   ``Fat is not really what it's about now,'' Ms. Sperber said
during a recent rehearsal break. ``The original script for the
pilot had a lot of fat jokes. But it was rewritten and by the time
we did the pilot, I said, `Wow, this is great.' Then when I saw it,
I realized there were still fat jokes in there. ...
   ``But it's really about their love and struggle and survival.
It's a more sensitive subject than I realized. It's like, `Gee, can
I laugh at her?'''
   In the Thursday night comedy series, Ms. Sperber stars as middle
sister Charlene, Susan Peretz plays the oldest sibling, Darlene,
and Lesley Boone is the youngest, Marlene.
   ``In the pilot, Darlene pours a whole box of cereal into a
bowl,'' Ms. Sperber said. ``An overweight person would laugh at
that. Maybe a thin person wouldn't think it funny. Even the bed
collapsing - they're all things that could happen. You don't have
to pound people over the head. But you can't ignore the fat jokes.
And we do make the jokes ourselves. It's not someone else joking
about us.''
   The actress points out that Valerie Harper's Rhoda is fondly
remembered from ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' yet all of the
laughs were at fat jokes until Miss Harper lost weight.
   Ms. Sperber previously played somewhat offbeat supporting
characters in such TV series as ``Bosom Buddies,'' ``Freestyle,''
``Women in Prison'' and ``Private Benjamin.''
   ``I was in the Army, in prison and lived with two men in drag,''
she said. ``I was an evil troll with a rose nose in a PBS show for
children, `Freestyle.' We've all had those kind of roles. In
`Babes,' I seem to have broken my stream of strange things.''
   Nonetheless, playing the straight lead for a change took a
little getting used to.
   ``The producers wanted me to play the role I'm now playing, but
I wanted to read for Darlene,'' she said. ``I felt it was more like
what I was used to playing. I'd always been the character who comes
on, says her lines and leaves.
   ``Charlene is kind of set up as the leading lady. That's more
pressure on my shoulders than I'm used to. But Charlene is like the
Mary Tyler Moore who's at the center. I'm really like a straight
man. She's the stable one, the logical one. I said, `How boring.'
But it's a sitcom and everybody's funny. Now I'm having a great
time.''
   Ms. Sperber is married and has two children - both born since
her last series, ``Women in Prison.'' She identified her husband
only as ``Richard, who's in public relations.''
   ``Charlene is really happy, really content,'' she said. ``She
has a great boyfriend, a great job. She's probably happy her
sisters have moved in with her. She has a lot of confidence and
self-esteem and a good self-image. I wish I had more of her
contentment about myself.
   ``Everyone is so wrapped up in looks today - come on, it's our
lives. It's ridiculous the way people will wreck their day or week
about their looks. Calm down. Don't be suicidal over such things.''
   Raised in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, Ms.
Sperber began her career appearing in theatrical films after she
was spotted by a casting director in a Hollywood play while still
in high school.
   ``A casting director came around and that's how I got `Grease,'
'' she said. ``I was a dancer and I worked one day, then I got
`Corvette Summer.' I never went back to `Grease.'''
   She was a fanatic Beatles fan in ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand,'' a
man-hungry woman at a USO dance in ``1941,'' and appeared in such
other movies as ``Moving Violations,'' ``Bachelor Party'' and
``Used Cars.''
   In ``Bosom Buddies,'' Ms. Sperber was the only one who knew Tom
Hanks and Peter Scolari were in drag so they could live in an
all-women residence.
   She was one of Lorna Patterson's barracks buddies in ``Private
Benjamin.''
   ``Lorna Patterson said the lines and I did the facial
expressions on `Private Benjamin,''' she said. ``My last series was
`Women in Prison.' I lived in a cell. I had a lot of power. I was
the leader of the pack. I had a TV, a VCR, a microwave.
   ``When I talk about it it sounds like a funny show, but it
wasn't. When you're doing a show, you don't know if it's good or
not.''

<HEAD>Turtles Nest More Peacefully With Ban on Hunting</HEAD>

   Hosts of olive ridley turtles crawl
from the thundering surf, in a season more peaceful than the last,
to lay their eggs on a beach that stretches to the horizon.
   Olive ridleys were butchered by the tens of thousands a year
ago, but in May, the government forbade the killing.
   Fishing boats no longer prowl the waters off the main nesting
beach. The slaughterhouse 12 miles away is silent and abandoned,
its roof collapsed inside the concrete-block walls.
   Not all the danger is gone, however.
   Biologists working out of a nearby camp still race egg thieves
to the nests. Authorities recently confiscated 944 skins,
representing half as many dead turtles, in a village up the coast
known in the past for clandestine slaughter.
   Fishermen who lived by killing sea turtles have few
alternatives.
   Those in the cooperative at San Agustinillo, where the
slaughterhouse sits derelict, were well off last season. Now, they
wonder how to feed their families.
   ``We all know the ecologists have money to take food home every
day without any problem, and they've put us on a diet,'' Silverio
Alvarez said of the pressure to stop the killing of sea turtles.
   By all accounts, there are more turtles this year - in part
because of the ban and in part, it seems, because it's just a good
year for turtles.
   ``I think I could definitely say the death toll has decreased,''
said Georgita Ruiz, a veterinarian who has studied turtles for 13
years.
   ``There are more turtles nesting on the beach than in previous
years. They have natural surges in nesting activity, but I think
it's logical that if there isn't as much disturbance where they're
going to nest, you're going to see more.''
   She added, however: ``People are still people and they're still
hungry. They're going to beg, borrow, steal or kill to get what
they need.''
   Ms. Ruiz runs the Pronatura conservation organization's turtle
program at Escobilla, 300 miles southeast of Mexico City on the
Pacific coast of Oaxaca state.
   Elpidio Marcelino Lopez said the 10 to 15 boats he saw capturing
turtles 200 yards off the beach last year aren't there this season.
Marcelino is a biologist from Oaxaca State University who has spent
several seasons at the Escobilla camp.
   Conservationists say some killing continues despite the ban
decreed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   ``We know there are two clandestine slaughterhouses,'' said
Homero Aridjis, president of the Group of 100 environmental group.
   He said they were discovered on secondary nesting beaches, one
of which also is used by leatherback turtles. Aridjis said there
was no indication how many turtles were being processed there.
   Biologists move the eggs from nests on the beach to nursery
areas at the camp.
   ``If we had 200 nests, they'd steal 201,'' Marcelino said of the
egg thieves.
   Mexico was the world's leading killer of sea turtles and Japan
its biggest customer.
   The victims generally were olive ridleys, the most numerous of
the seven species of sea turtles. Six of the seven species are
found in Mexico.
   What makes olive ridleys special are their arribadas, mass
nestings that occur about once a month from July to December.
Biologists estimate 75,000 nested on 1{ miles of the Escobilla
beach during the October arribada, more than in all of 1988 and
more than half the 1989 total.
   Marcelino also said more are nesting between arribadas this
year.
   Pairs of turtle tracks make stripes on the beach, one from the
water, the other returning, their edges scrolled like ocean waves.
The tracks going up the beach are a bit deeper, because of the 10
pounds of eggs in a 100-pound turtle.
   If there is only one track, a turtle is at the end of it. Her
back flippers, curled like hands, scoop out a hole where she lays
100 or so eggs the size of pingpong balls. Then she fills the hole,
tamping down the sand, and heads back to the sea.
   Olive ridleys have nine other major nesting beaches worldwide,
but the level of killing wiped out the two or three other major
sites in Mexico.
   ``There was no reason to think Oaxaca wouldn't go the same
way,'' Ms. Ruiz said.
   An estimated 70,000 turtles were killed in 1989. The legal
limit, divided among licensed cooperatives, was 23,000.
   In addition to forbidding the olive ridley kill, the
presidential decree increased the government commitment to enforce
bans on killing other turtle species and the taking and selling of
eggs, shells, skins and other products. It also supports research.
   In San Agustinillo, there were two things to do: capture turtles
or work at the slaughterhouse. Both stopped at the end of May.
   ``Sometimes we borrow money, or you don't eat beans, you eat
tortillas, just to buy school supplies for the children,'' said
Alvarez, the idle fisherman.
   He said he had earned about $140 from turtles during peak
months, as much in five days as fish brought the rest of the month.
With their minds on nesting, turtles are easy to grab.
   Shark fishing, a likely alternative, means going so far to sea
you can lose sight of land, he said, more fuel and maintenance for
the boat and, without a radio, more danger.
   New boats, motors, trucks and nets the government Fishing
Department gave cooperatives do not make up for the loss, Alvarez
said.
   Fishermen contend there are plenty of turtles. Those outside
cooperatives are blamed for much of the illegal killing, before the
ban and now.
   ``Even with all the vigilance we have, the nesting beaches are
very extensive,'' said Myrna Wong of the Fishing Department. ``You
can't cover all of it at the same time.''
   Todd Steiner, director of the sea turtle project of Earth Island
Institute, agreed the ban had been effective, but also said: ``I
think if the international environmental community goes to sleep,
all the turtles will get is a temporary reprieve.''
   On a busy Saturday in Mexico City's Tepito market, famous for
contraband, four vendors hawked turtle eggs, a delicacy, at three
for the equivalent of $1.70.
   Businesses were required to register their turtle products after
the decree, but there was no deadline on selling non-perishable
products. That makes tracing new stock, an indication of poaching,
more difficult.
   Authorities have confiscated large amounts of tortoise shell, a
product of the hawksbill, but Homero Aridjis, president of the
Group of 100 environmental organization, said it still is available
in stores.
   Two men selling part-turtle boots were certain they wouldn't run
out.
   ``There's always clandestine trade,'' Hector Guevara said,
making a gesture under the table.

   Elpidio Marcelino Lopez cut the lights
of his red, three-wheeled dune cycle amd skimmed over the dark sand
in friendly pursuit of olive ridley sea turtles.
   Any day, the turtles were expected to have an arribada, a
nesting on the beach at night by the tens of thousands. Marcelino's
mission was to learn whether it had begun.
   ``There's one laying eggs,'' he said, gesturing toward loose
sand above the high-tide mark without breaking speed. ``There's one
covering the nest.''
   Another olive ridley climbed from the rolling surf.
   Marcelino is one of 10 biologists from universities, the
Pronatura conservation organization and federal Fishing Department
who work at Escobilla, site of 80 percent to 90 percent of the
olive ridley nesting in Mexico.
   After turtles lay their eggs and return to the sea, Marcelino
and the others dig into the sand elbow deep, remove the eggs and
rebury them in a nursery area at the camp. Otherwise, looters will
get them by morning.
   In 42 days, slate-colored hatchlings the size of silver dollars
will emerge and head for the sea. It will be the last time on land
for most of the males, which will grow larger than dishpans but may
not reproduce for 20 years.
   Because moving the eggs cuts the survival rate by about half,
some biologists favor leaving them alone and putting even more
patrols on the beach.
   Besides counting the nests every hour and moving the eggs,
biologists check adult turtles for tags and attach new ones.
   ``Our function here is to see that the greatest number possible
get to the sea,'' Marcelino said.
   He is from a farm near Jamiltepec, 125 northwest of Escobilla,
the fifth of 11 children, and understands the people who take eggs
or used to capture turtles.
   ``I want very much to save the turtle, but to help people at the
same time,'' Marcelino said. He favors allowing some killing
because ``there aren't sources of jobs on the coast.''
   Three miles down the beach, Marcelino turned the dune cycle
inland, taking a trail back to camp through morning glory vines and
seaside cactus.
   The turtles arrived for their arribada six days later.

<HEAD>Army Reserves: A Constant Challenge for Israeli Men and Families</HEAD>

   Every few months, Lenny
Labensohn digs his olive-drab uniform and army boots out of the
closet. He packs a shaving kit, tosses in a deck of cards and
becomes a soldier again.
   ``Milu'im'' - reserve duty - is the backbone of the citizen army
that defends the Jewish state. Every able-bodied Israeli male up to
age 55 is obliged to give a month or two of active service a year.
   Most Israelis see it as a mixed blessing. While it disrupts
their lives and exposes them to physical danger, it also offers an
escape from job and family pressures into the clubby embrace of old
army buddies.
   It is common to see graying men in army fatigues hitchhiking
home toting M-16 rifles, but Israelis insist theirs is no garrison
state. If anything, they feel it gives the army a more human face,
makes it reflect society's values.
   Nowadays, society is deeply divided by the Palestinian uprising.
The schism inevitably has reached the reservists, who are called
increasingly into confrontation with unarmed Arab rioters.
   Few have refused outright to do the job, but newspapers report a
new trend called ``gray refusal'' - finding excuses to avoid
postings in the occupied territories. Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper
quoted officers as saying thousands of ``milu'imniks'' had taken
this route.
   Israeli men serve three years in the regular army. Women serve
two years, but few do reserve duty.
   According to the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, the army
can triple its size by calling up 370,000 reservists within a few
days.
   In wartime, reservists are summoned at a moment's notice, but
otherwise the brown envelope containing the ``milu'im'' notice
usually arrives six weeks in advance, along with instructions on
limbering up for army life.
   Reservists may be posted anywhere from the guerrilla-prone
Lebanese border to a Palestinian refugee camp in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   Since the army's philosophy is to treat reservists like
grownups, it isn't particular about long hair or shabby boots.
   ``I enjoy putting on a uniform and stopping being a couch
potato, and going out there and living in nature, knowing my body
can still do it,'' said Labensohn, a paratroop sergeant who
immigrated from Canada 25 years ago.
   At 47, he could ask for a less demanding task, like guard duty,
but Labensohn feels he's delaying a midlife crisis.
   ``The minute they tell me they don't need me anymore, then what
the hell good am I?'' he said.
   Labensohn, who in civilian life makes promotional films for
Jewish fund-raisers, sees reserve duty as a social leveler.
   ``You have hotshot lawyers from big corporations in Tel Aviv,
simple salesmen and bus drivers all in one unit,'' he said. ``I
would never meet with these kind of people otherwise. ... Everybody
feels good about everybody.''
   In quiet periods, reserve duty averages 30 to 40 days a year.
But an old saying defines the Israeli citizen as a soldier on
extended leave, and many served unbroken tours of up to six months
during and after the 1973 Middle East war.
   At the height of the Palestinian uprising, an average of 10,000
men were on duty in the West Bank and Gaza and reserve tours were
extended.
   Natti Gefen, a 37-year-old decorator, said Palestinians find the
reservists easier to get along with than young regular army
soldiers. He spoke of Arabs who would make a half-hour detour to a
roadblock manned by reservists.
   ``They see us as suckers,'' he remarked while on duty in Gaza.
``They told me they think we are weak soldiers because we are too
good to them.''
   The transformation from office desk to field post is abrupt.
Milu'imniks do hard physical work, sleep in tents, eat army chow.
   Between patrols, Gefen's comrades relaxed in their small base on
a hillock overlooking 60,000 Palestinians crowded into the Jabaliya
refugee camp.
   Bank teller Ephraim Dekastro played mah-jongg with computer
operator Miki Amir. They have been in the same unit for 17 years.
   On average, the The Gaza troops were a 90-minute drive from home
and could expect two furloughs a month.
   Miki Amir said the men can talk openly about intimate problems
because they have been comrades for so long.
   ``Our fences come down and it lets us share things that you
don't even tell your neighbors, sometimes even your wife,'' he
said.
   On some tours, the men patrol the Syrian border or spend a dusty
month training in tanks. Like most Israeli men, they have fought at
least one war, but their four reserve tours in three years have
been spent chasing stone-throwing Palestinians.
   They man roadblocks and patrol Jabaliya's alleys in jeeps,
dodging firebombs and stones.
   Nine of the 12 soldiers killed in the uprising were reservists.
   ``Death is always on your mind,'' said Dani Ben-Tal, a
free-lance writer who recently spent 30 days on the Syrian border.
``That is the reality of life in Israel. It is because of this
reality that we are in milu'im.''
   Reservists are compensated for lost earnings, but not for
overtime and perks. Gefen, the decorator, said he had to stop
accepting new commissions two weeks before every tour.
   Call-up dates can be negotiated and exemptions are available to
those who can prove severe financial or family problems, but men
liable for reserve duty need their commanders' permission to travel
abroad. Students find their studies severely disrupted.
   After the average reserve tour was raised from 40 to 62 days in
1988, wives mounted an organized protest. Duty time has been
trimmed to 42 days.
   ``I learn to function very well without him,'' said Labensohn's
wife, Judy.
   ``I can finagle the bank manager to increase our overdraft. I
can kick the washing machine into doing a rinse. I can take the
puppy to the vet with all three kids and no crying, and I can even
convince the crooks at the garage that consumer awareness has hit
Israel.''
   ``Lenny goes to the army and comes home and then goes to the
army again,'' she said. ``It has a rhythm, like the seasons, but
the encounter with death snickers from every little brown
envelope.''

<TEXT>
   There is a growing perception within the Bush
administration that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's power
is ebbing, leading U.S. officials to open lines of communication to
other levels of the Soviet system.
   Some U.S. officials are searching for ways to shore up
Gorbachev's beleaguered regime, while at the same time trying to
position the United States for a possible realignment of political
power in the Soviet Union.
   ``The evidence is clear that power is now moving out of the
central government to other levels, or even out of government
altogether,'' said one U.S. official who agreed to discuss the
issue on condition his name not be used. ``The focus now is in the
republics.''
   Another official said the administration is not worried - at
least not at this point - about the Soviets' ability to live up to
their international agreements or about any desire to change their
strategic posture.
   International confidence in the Kremlin's peaceful intentions
will be on display this week when President Bush, Gorbachev and the
leaders of 32 other nations gather for the signing of a long-sought
agreement to reduce conventional forces in Europe and end the
military faceoff that divided East and West throughout the Cold
War.
   The Bush administration doesn't doubt the Soviet regime's will,
one source explained, but added: ``The danger is that Gorbachev may
lose the ability to make decisions and carry them through.''
   That official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the United States is now working with reform leaders in the Russian
federation, the Baltics and elsewhere, partly in hopes of shoring
up Gorbachev's political standing at home.
   ``By helping the reform movement at various levels, we help
Gorbachev,'' the official said. ``It gives us other access, more
information about what's going on, plus it's neutral-to-beneficial
for Gorbachev because we're supporting Gorbachev. It doesn't
undermine him.''
   Fourteen of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics have
declared sovereignty or, in a few cases, their intention to seek
complete independence from Soviet rule. Boris Yeltsin, president of
the Russian federation, which accounts for roughly half the Soviet
population, is threatening to institute his own reforms that could
establish an economic system independent of the central government.
   The deteriorating Soviet economy is at the root of much of the
public's unhappiness with the central government.
   In one sense, the shift of power away from the center ``is quite
consistent with democratization,'' which the U.S. government has
supported wholeheartedly, one analyst observed. But he added that
it complicates Western efforts to support reform.
   ``We recognize that imbalances and uncertainty can lead to
instability,'' the source said. ``There is a potential for a very
high level of frustration, public indignation, a volatile situation
if economic deterioration continues.''
   Demonstrators from both the left and right showed their anger
with Gorbachev and the economic calamity in Revolution Day
demonstrations Nov. 7 marking the 73rd anniversary of the Russian
Revolution.
   John Hardt, a specialist in Soviet affairs at the Library of
Congress, said Gorbachev does not appear in imminent danger. He
retains control of the police, the military and the KGB, the secret
police agency responsible for state security, Hrdt noted.
   ``The levers of power are quite clearly in Gorbachev's hands,''
he said, adding that the Soviet leader was able to implement
massive military reductions and set a new course for Soviet policy
in the Middle East, neither of which could be expected to garner
strong support from the military establishment or government
bureaucracy.
   But Hardt acknowledged that Gorbachev is threatened by crises
rippling through Soviet society and that his popularity inside his
own country is extremely low compared to his status elsewhere in
the world.
   ``Gorbachev's power is becoming more diffuse,'' said a State
Department official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But
we want to be careful not to sell him short. He's shown he can
accomplish a great deal, even against tremendous inertia and
resistance.''
   ``Time will tell,'' the source said, ``whether this master of
the old political system can master the new'' one he has installed.
   A source familiar with foreign policy strategy discussions at
the top levels of the administration said there does not appear to
be an imminent threat to Gorbachev.
   ``There is no apparent challenger, no alternative, no reason to
expect military intervention,'' the source said. ``What is more
likely is that it will become harder for him to exert influence.
   ``To a degree, that's a natural result of increasing pluralism,
and we applaud that. But what's difficult is the institutional
structures have not had much time to develop, and that makes for an
unstable situation.''
   The United States, several sources said, is continuing to
support Gorbachev while trying to establish contacts at other
levels, particularly where it can encourage economic reform and
creation of market forces.
   ``Arms control agreements still have to be negotiated at the
central government level,'' one source explained. ``But we can
provide technical cooperation and support economic activity at both
levels.''
   The Soviet republics are in some ways similar to the states of
the United States in that they have government structures that
mirror the one in Moscow. Under Gorbachev's predecessors, the
Kremlin dictated practically all policy to the republics, but it
clearly can no longer do that. Today, under pressure from
nationalists and malcontents in almost every republic, it is
struggling to keep the union from splintering along republic or
ethnic lines while it negotiates a new balance of power between the
center and the republics.
   The shift in power complicates the effort to back Gorbachev and
his reforms, one source said. ``No one has much experience in
making changes of this sort.''
   ``Gorbachev's ace in the hole is that he is the only Soviet
leader who has made it on the world stage,'' said another official.
``True, that doesn't put food on the table, but many realize they
need the West if they're going to improve and modernize their own
situation.
   ``Much of the Soviet leadership recognizes this, even if they
don't like it. So Gorbachev has a strong card to play in foreign
relations.''

<HEAD>New Survey Says Cattlemen Care About Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle producers have said for years they care
about the environment and do a lot to protect the soil, water,
grass and crops that keep them in business. Now they are seeking to
prove it.
   The National Cattlemen's Association, which represents 250,000
producers throughout the country, says a new survey shows a growing
number of cattlemen are ``active conservationists'' who care about
land and water resources.
   But that does not mean all cattle producers are in a single
herd.
   Critics contend that many cattle producers overgraze pastures
and ranges, allow feedlot runoffs to pollute streams, and have poor
track records in the use of agricultural chemicals.
   They also say - wrongly, according to cattlemen - that eating
red meat is unhealthy, besides being hard on the animals.
   Since 1980, the survey found that about 30 percent of the
producers have increased the number of man-made stock ponds, areas
with newly planted trees, wells and other water developments, areas
that support wildlife, and dikes, levees and waterways.
   In addition, the report said, 27 percent of the producers plan
to increase their use of such conservation practices in the next
five years.
   The private survey done for the association was conducted in
July and August among a random sample of 700 producers in 48
states. The sampling involved cattle producers with more than 100
head, and did not include large commercial feedlots.
   John Lacey, association president, said the survey showed that
``conservation and protection of land and water are a part of the
cattleman's way of life'' as well as a business venture.
   ``A cattleman depends on the land for his livelihood, and, to
assure a livelihood for future generations, he must protect and
improve the environment for which he is responsible,'' Lacey said.
   The survey shows that 86 percent of cattle producers grow crops
or hay used as feed. Of these, according to the report, 60 percent
``have held the line on use of feed crop production in the past 10
years, and 25 percent have reduced the amount of chemicals they
use.''
   As for wildlife habitat, 80 percent of those surveyed have areas
on their farms and ranches that support wildlife, and 31 percent
have increased those ares in the last decade. Further, 39 percent
plan to increase wildlife areas in the next five years.
   The association, whose organizational roots go back to 1898, has
gone on the offensive on a broad front in recent years to defend
the cattle industry against what many of its members consider
unfounded and stupid allegations.
   As a result, the association has distributed information aimed
at dispelling what it considers falsehoods or slanted claims about
the beef industry. For example:
   -On the average, only 4.5 pounds of grain are used in producing
one pound of beef, retail weight, not the 16 pounds often cited by
critics who claim fattening cattle on grain is a waste of food
needed by hungry nations.
   ``World hunger is not caused by shortage of grain in the world,
but rather is a result of poverty, lack of buying power and
problems in food distribution.''
   -Cattle are efficient users of resources. Grazing cattle more
than doubles the U.S. land area that can be used to produce food.
Ruminants - grazing animals with four stomachs - allow food to be
harvested from more than one billion acres of range and pasture
land in the United States.
   ``At least 85 percent of this grazing land is too high, too
rough, too dry, too wet or too cold to grow cultivated crops.
Additionally, cattle consume crop residues and food byproducts that
otherwise would be wasted.''
   -The total amount of water used in on-farm production of
grain-fed beef averages 200 gallons per pound of carcass beef, not
the 2,500 gallons often cited by critics.
   ``Water for cattle production is not used up. It is quickly
recycled as part of nature's hydrological cycle.''
   -Most of the energy used in cattle production is solar energy
used in growing grasses and forage crops, as well as feed grains.
Grazing alone supplies 57 percent of the feed energy used in
producing beef cattle.
   ``The fossil fuel energy used to produce 70 pounds of beef,
retail weight, the average U.S. per capita consumption, is
equivalent to 12-25 gallons of gasoline per year. This is just
one-fifteenth of a gallon for four ounces of beef - one serving.''
   Beef production accounts for less than 0.5 percent of total
energy use in the United States.
   One of the thorniest criticisms comes from animal rights
advocates who contend livestock producers subject animals to
unnecessary hardships and inhumane practices.
   In its pamphlet ``Myths and Facts About Beef Production,''
printed on recycled paper and complete with footnoted references,
the association said ``inhumane practices are not only morally
wrong, they are not economic'' for producers.
   ``Any type of abuse or neglect or harmful practice is
counterproductive,'' the association said. ``If cattlemen are to
remain in business and remain on their farms and ranches, they must
be efficient producers.''
   It added: ``That requires proper feeding, health maintenance,
care and handling. Management of cattle involves hands-on care.
Cattlemen and cattlewomen, not machines, monitor, feed and care for
their livestock.''

<HEAD>War Powers Ambiguity Likely To Last Through This Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Democratic leaders looked at the prospect
of an emergency session of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis,
they saw an old, intractable dilemma over warmaking power. So
Congress will investigate instead of trying to legislate.
   A question of presidential and congressional powers that has
gone unresolved for 200 years isn't about to be settled in a
special session while U.S. forces are at risk against Iraq.
   There have been repeated attempts to amend the creaky, usually
irrelevant war powers system that already is on the lawbooks, none
successful. And what couldn't be done in tranquil times, when the
issues were hypothetical, can hardly be accomplished in the midst
of a giant military buildup in the Middle East.
   When congressional leaders reminded President Bush that Congress
has the power to declare war, he took out his own copy of the
Constitution, said he understood that, and reminded them that it
also makes him commander in chief.
   He also said he has made no decision to take military action and
would consult with them before using force. While he made no
commitment to seek congressional action in advance of a response to
Iraqi provocation, his assurances satisfied the Democrats, at least
for the time being.
   So the push for a special session of Congress to debate and act
on the Gulf crisis - an idea launched by Republicans - has been
shelved. There will be congressional hearings on the
administration's military and diplomatic policy toward Iraq. And
the administration has repeated its promise of continuing
consultation with House and Senate leaders.
   The escalated debate last week was prompted by the president's
plans to nearly double the size of the U.S. force deployed in Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf, reinforcements the administration said would
provide an offensive capability for use if needed.
   That seemed to be a threat aimed at Saddam Hussein, to turn up
the pressure for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. But the message
stirred concern in Congress, where Democrats like Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said there had
been a fundamental change in policy, to an offensive mission of
liberating Kuwait.
   He said that was a casebook example of a situation in which
Congress should be called upon for a declaration of war - something
that has happened only five times in U.S. history.
   Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana took the lead in
proposing a special session of Congress, which he said should act
to authorize U.S. operations in a manner that would display
American unity and staying power.
   The White House said a special session was unnecessary because
there is no war and the president wants to avoid one.
   And the Democrats weren't enthusiastic about the idea, either.
Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the majority leader, said there
should be no special session without a clearly defined purpose.
Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley said he wasn't going to put
Democrats in a potentially embarrassing position.
   Congress already has voted its overwhelming approval to the
Persian Gulf operation, in resolutions adopted in October that
declare support for continued action by the president ``to deter
Iraqi aggression and protect American lives and vital interests,''
in accord with United Nations decisions and with U.S. legal
requirements.
   Mitchell said there was no way to read into the October
resolutions any approval for offensive military action. They were
adopted only after repeated declarations that Congress was not
approving anything like the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, the 1964
measure later cited by the White House as the equivalent of a
declaration of war in Vietnam.
   The Democratic preference is to wait while international
economic sanctions take their toll on Iraq and, presumably, force
Saddam to yield, it takes 18 months or more.
   While Republican congressional leaders say that's too long, the
White House isn't talking about specific time frames, only about
maintaining the pressure on Saddam Hussein. And, as Mitchell said,
that doesn't take congressional approval.
   ``Obviously ... a president need not get a prior act of Congress
to issue a threat,'' Mitchell said.
   He is supposed to get approval for deployment of American forces
in hostilities ``or into situations where imminent involvement in
hostilities is clearly indicated.'' That's the 1973 war powers law,
enacted over presidential veto, opposed by every administration
since. That measure requires congressional approval in order to
keep U.S. forces in such circumstances for more than 90 days, but
it never has been enforced.
   In this case, Bush advised Congress that he did not believe
involvement in hostilities was imminent. That stands, although the
troops involved are receiving the additional pay that goes with
facing possible hostilities.
   Force, after all, is an administration option, ``a clear and
unmistakable signal,'' according to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III. The challenge to Bush is to keep the pressure on by
making that worry Iraq without shaking his backing at home.

<HEAD>Building Blocks of Bandelier Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BENKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caves were a cinch to
carve in the soft volcanic-ash face of Bandelier, meaning these
centuries-old Indian ruins are just as easily erased by fire and
erosion.
   ``The erosion itself is starting to threaten some of the ruins
in the back country, and that is unacceptable,'' said Roy Weaver,
superintendent of Bandelier National Monument, the park in the
Jemez Mountains 45 miles west of Santa Fe.
   The park boasts 3,000 to 5,000 archaeological sites dating from
1100 to 1760, including remnants of three-story pueblos that had as
many as 400 rooms. But time, weather and the effects of man's
encroachment are slowly eating away at Bandelier's building blocks.
   Outside the visitors center in Frijoles Canyon are the ruins of
a village called Tyuonyi, an ellipse of dwellings around a central
religious chamber, or kiva, into which people descended by ladder.
   Tourists may stroll through Tyuonyi on an asphalt path and peer
down into the excavated kiva. They also may visit dwellings carved
into the soft volcanic ash, or tuff, on the north wall of Frijoles
Canyon.
   ``With primitive tools - like a good, hard oak stick - you could
literally hack yourself a cave into the walls,'' said Bob Powers, a
National Park Service archaeologist who is heading a study of
Bandelier.
   Ladders are provided for visitors to climb into some caves. One
series of ladders leads to a restored kiva cut 140 feet high in the
cliff's face. Visitors may enter the kiva.
   Last year, 322,000 people wandered through, Weaver said.
   In contrast, Frijoles Canyon had a population of probably no
more than 700 people at its peak, around 1300 to 1550, Powers said.
Around 1550, Tyuonyi was abandoned. The reasons remain unclear.
   ``My gut feeling is that a combination of overhunting, overuse
of natural resources, a growing population and a lot of competition
from other pueblos throughout the Rio Grande Valley may have made
the area not very viable economically,'' Powers said.
   Cochiti Pueblo, still flourishing nearby, is believed to have
evolved from this settlement. A Cochiti Indian first led Swiss-born
anthropologist Adolf Bandelier into cave-studded Frijoles Canyon in
1880, who called it ``the grandest thing I ever saw.''
   His 150th birthday, Aug. 6, was celebrated this summer at the
park, which will be 75 years old in February.
   Powers' crews completed their fourth year of field work here in
August and return in the spring for their final year. Their
findings have yet to be analyzed.
   ``Our major focus is to try and figure out why the big pueblos
that appear in the early 1300s, why those were built,'' said
Powers. ``Why did they all move in together in these big communal
pueblos?''
   That was a major change in their cultural habits, he said.
   ``One factor almost certainly is a growing population,'' he
said. ``As population increases, there are not as many resources.''
   The crews have been mapping the thousands of caves and other
ruins that dot the monument's 32,737 acres, trying to stay ahead of
the erosion that periodically sheers off pieces of the cliff.
   ``We have two kinds of erosion. One is visitor-induced. The
other is based on previous land-management abuses,'' he said.
``This goes back over 100 years. Because of the overgrazing and the
elimination of fire, the natural grasses which were quite extensive
at the time have been eliminated.''
   He said overgrazing stopped 60 years ago, but much of the damage
already was done.
   ``The ground is uncovered, and erosion is occurring. We're
losing in some areas a tenth of an inch (of soil) per year right
now,'' he said.
   A management statement published last April said: ``The erosion
problem must be addressed immediately or severe, irreversible
damage will occur to the park's pinon-juniper ecosystems and
possibly to thousands of associated archaeological sites.''
   Weaver said he doesn't know what the federal budget has in store
for him, so he doesn't know what crews will be able to do about
erosion.
   Controlled burning, thinning of too-dense trees and replanting
grasses all take money.
   Fire-suppression has caused an overproliferation of pinon and
juniper, scrub trees that actually heighten fire danger, Weaver
said.
   In 1977, a fire burned through ruins on nearby Escobas Mesa. The
intense heat and firefighting efforts that included heavy equipment
turned much of the ruins into dust, said Judy Miles, field director
for the archaeological study.
   Those ruins, like Tyuonyi and the other ancient villages of
Bandelier, had been made of bricks of tuff, Powers and Miles said.
   The tuff was created by two series of cataclysmic eruptions 1.4
million and 1.1 million years ago that formed the nearby Valles
Caldera. Tuff is a mixture of frothy glass bubbles, glass shards,
crystal fragments and bits of rock, said Wolf Elston, a geologist
at the University of New Mexico. Heat bursts the bubbles, he said.

<HEAD>Panic Attacks Keep Thousands From Malls, Off Roads</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Americans are too afraid to
get into their cars, shop at the mall or even venture out of the
house, worried they'll suffer a panic attack.
   ``It's a horrible feeling,'' said Ann, a 51-year-old Richmond
real estate agent. ``I feel like I'm losing control. I feel like
the world around me doesn't exist and I feel like I'm going to
die.''
   Ann, who asked that her last name be withheld, said the panic
attacks began when she was about 8, but she was too afraid to tell
anyone.
   ``I didn't even tell my parents,'' she said. ``We're very good
at faking things. I didn't know whether I was mentally unbalanced.
People with panic attacks are good liars, good excuse-makers.''
   Ann had trouble going to the beauty parlor or sitting through a
Sunday church service. She started avoiding the places where she
had the attacks, places where she felt closed in.
   About 3 million people suffer from panic attacks, said Dr.
William T. Riley, co-director of the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at
the Medical College of Virginia.
   ``Most people have experienced at least one or two panic attacks
in their lifetime,'' he said. ``For it to be something that we
consider a disorder, that we need to treat, people need to
experience about one a week.''
   The symptoms often mimic a heart attack. They include chest
pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling and sweating,
nausea and abdominal distress.
   The disorder is known as agoraphobia when people start avoiding
places where they experience the attacks.
   Panic disorders seem to develop primarily in people in their
20s, Riley said. It can strike anywhere, anytime. Evidence suggests
people inherit a predisposition to panic attacks. Othe factors
indicate outside stress contributes to the problem.
   ``A lot of the people who have panic disorders had problems with
separation from mom and dad early on,'' he said. ``They had
difficulty with being left at the baby sitter, difficulty going to
school by themselves.''
   The attack can last 15 to 30 minutes, and more often than not,
people can disguise the fact that they're having one.
   ``On the outside, all they'll usually see in these folks is that
they look hotter, more sweaty. They'll shake a little bit and have
some difficulty talking.
   ``A lot of time they can keep working or hold it together.''
   The two most frequent things people with panic attacks avoid are
driving and shopping malls.
   ``They're real afraid of being trapped and having this panic
attack happen in front of a bunch of people, where they can't get
out,'' Riley said. ``Malls are very crowded and there aren't a lot
of exits. They're OK in a shopping center. They can get to the
doors quick.''
   This month, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first
medication for the treatment of panic disorders. Xanax, known
generically as alprazolam, had been used to treat clinical anxiety
and anxiety associated with depression.
   The drug is manufactured by Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich.
Executives there said a biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is
believed to be one of the causes of panic attacks. Xanax can block
the attacks by interacting with several different systems in the
brain.
   Patients also must learn how to control their behavior, Riley
said. They learn relaxation techniques, they learn how to talk
themselves out of the episode. Then, they begin to try to tackle
the things they're most fearful of.
   ``If they're fearful of driving because they started to have
these panic attacks, we start working on the drive,'' he said. ``If
they're fearful of going to the mall, a first step may be nothing
more than driving there, sitting in the parking lot for five
minutes and going back home.''
   Agoraphobics also attend support group sessions. For example, in
Richmond about 700 people belong to Agoraphobics Building
Independent Lives.
   The treatment is effective about 70 percent to 80 percent of the
time, Riley said.
   Ann, who has been working closely with Riley, said she has
gotten to the point where she can go to the grocery store, a
discount store and even the beauty salon.
   ``I took my car through the carwash by myself two weeks ago,''
she said. ``I'm still having trouble with the interstates, because
you can't get off of them until the exits.''
   Her most recent assignment was to drive the interstate a little
each day.
   ``You take a little bit at a time,'' she said. ``If you do it
without anxiety, you've really done something.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists are searching for ways to improve
the humble sweet potato, a nutritious vegetable that may have a
future beyond the Thanksgiving table - in fancy restaurants and
outer space.
   Melvin Hall, a horticulturist at the University of Georgia's
Coastal Plain Experiment Station in Tifton, said scientists in
several states are trying to develop new varieties that give
growers higher yields and are more resistant to insects and
diseases.
   Sweet potatoes, a subterranean relative of morning glories, are
high in carbohydrates and vitamins, and Hall believes they could
appeal more to health-conscious consumers.
   ``A lot of time people think sweet potatoes are things you eat
when you're about to starve to death,'' he said. ``We'd like to
think of the sweet potato as something you can find in a fancy
restaurant.''
   Hall tries to develop improved varieties through genetics
research. Each year, he plants 10 to 12 acres and then evaluates
the results. He bakes and tastes the most promising sweet potatoes.
   He said it's difficult to conduct genetics research with sweet
potatoes because they have six sets of chromosomes, compared to
only two in humans.
   ``It's complicated to mathematically figure out what will
happen,'' he said. ``We have to have thousands and thousands of
seeds to come up with new genetic combinations that might be better
than what we already have.''
   Scientists in North and South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Alabama are conducting similar breeding tests. Researchers in
other states share information on yields and quality.
   Hall said scientists at Tuskegee University in Alabama are
working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on a
sweet potato for space.
   The sweet potato is one of the few plants that is 100 percent
edible, and space travelers could eat the stems and leaves, leaving
no waste.
   ``We don't normally think of the vines, but in some parts of the
world, they're considered a delicacy,'' Hall said.
   The most popular variety is the Jewel, a sweet potato that has
been around for at least 20 years. Scientists released the
Beauregard a few years ago in Louisiana, but growers are still
evaluating it.
   North Carolina is the nation's top producer. Louisiana is
second, and Georgia, California and Texas vie for third.
   With the emphasis on health foods, Hall said, people are
beginning to see the benefits of eating sweet potatoes, which are
used in soups, souffles and ice cream.
   ``I think the interest in health will at least keep the
consumption level stable and hopefully ... people will come to see
these as not only healthy, but delightful,'' he said.

<HEAD>Turkey Struts Its Stuff Year Round Nowadays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ben Franklin wanted the turkey to be our
national bird, for some reason finding it more respectable than the
eagle. He failed, but Americans are gobbling up turkey like never
before.
   It now appears as sausage, ground up, as cutlets or as boned
roasts, cooked into meatloaf, cut up in salads, tossed with pastas
or piled onto sandwiches.
   Thirty years ago, 90 percent of all turkey sold in the United
States was consumed in November and December, according to the
National Turkey Federation. Today, health-conscious consumers are
drawn to turkey's low fat content (as little as a third that of
beef), and 60 percent of our turkey is eaten during the other 10
months of the year.
   Annual consumption has jumped from 10 pounds per person in 1980
to an estimated 19 pounds this year.
   At this time of year, however, it is the groaning Thanksgiving
table that the turkey most often graces. Rick Rodgers, author of
``The Turkey Cookbook,'' estimates 45 million whole turkeys are
eaten that one day.
   Rodgers offers 14 recipes for cooking the whole bird, including
Texas turkey with chili powder, peppers and onions; a Bayou-style
roast turkey; and an Italian version with lemon, rosemary and
roasted potatoes.
   But he says the juciest, crispest turkey is roasted unstuffed,
with herbs and aromatic vegetables placed in the cavities.
   November is the busiest month for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hot Line, with 16,000 calls last
November. About half the callers talked to a person; the rest heard
recorded messages on food safety, said the hot line's manager,
Susan D. Templin.
   The privately operated Butterball Turkey Talk-Line already has
``had just a deluge of calls this year,'' said Marge Klindera,
assistant supervisor.
   She cites a few reasons for the early calls: the popularity of
turkey, troubles getting through when the line was busy last year,
and a calendar Butterball is giving away.
   In its 10th year, the Turkey Talk-Line could receive its
millionth call this season, Klindera said. It is staffed by 44
nutritionists and home economists.
   Some recommendations for handling turkey:
   - To thaw a frozen turkey, keep it refrigerated one day for each
five pounds. Or place it in its wrapping in a sink and cover with
cold water. Change the water every half-hour, planning on 30
minutes per pound.
   - Fresh turkeys should be bought only one to two days before
cooking. Whole frozen turkeys will last a year frozen at zero
degrees.
   - Wash hands, utensils, counters and sinks that have come in
contact with raw turkey. ``Whenever you're handling a raw product,
you need to be worried about bacteria,'' said Templin. ``Around the
holiday, pople are preparing larger amounts of food, preparing
ahead, putting food out for large groups. So there's a lot of areas
where people can make mistakes.''
   - Stuff a turkey just before it is cooked.
   - Do not roast turkey overnight in a low-temperature oven.
Turkey should be cooked at 325 degrees or higher to prevent
bacteria growth.
   - Remove stuffing right after cooking. Do not leave a cooked
turkey at room temperature for more than two hours.
   - To cook a turkey ahead, cook to internal temperature of 180
degrees. Carve meat, except legs, thighs and wings. Refrigerate.
Reheat in 325-degree oven.
   - After dinner, cut meat from bones and refrigerate meat up to
four days or freeze.

<HEAD>Leaping into Exercise May Leave You Hurt
^Eds: A version on sports wires as BC-Lifestyle Sports.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRA DREYFUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exercise is one of those good things that you
can get too much of, and beginning exercisers should realize it,
experts say.
   The new demands on their bodies may unmask hidden medical
problems or break something that had been OK until they suddenly
put too much stress on it, they say.
   Beginners often ``don't know how, they don't know how much is
too much, or how to progress with it,'' said Dr. Douglas B. McKeag,
professor of family practice and coordinator of sports medicine at
Michigan State University.
   Experts say people should ease into exercise, increasing their
regimen by no more than 10 percent in time or distance each week.
   Exercise should start with a warmup, in ``an effort not to jump
start the body,'' and rip a muscle that's unprepared for maximum
exertion, he said. If you want to stretch, do it slowly and gently,
he said, adding that he's ``more and more convinced that stretching
is less and less important.''
   Similarly, a beginner can exercise too frequently, too long or
too intensely. McKeag recommends every other day, t a heart rate
of at least 60 percent of your maximum (the maximum is computed
from the number 220 minus your age), for at least 15 minutes a day.
   Pushing beyond that, he said, can lead you into injuries that
strike the area you use the most. Bicyclists get knee pains,
runners get shin splints, tennis players get tennis elbow, swimmers
get sore shoulders - they all are listed as overuse injuries,
McKeag said.
   The doctor strongly recommends a cooldown - a slow easing off
from your exercise peak.
   ``When major cardiac events occur as a result of exercise, it
happens right after exercise,'' he said. Quitting cold sends your
blood pressure bouncing like a yo-yo, as your body reacts to the
changes in blood pressure that result.
   Another problem is that people who didn't know they had heart
disease may find it when they add the stress of exercise, said Dr.
William L. Haskell, professor of medicine at Stanford University
School of Medicine.
   ``A fair number of middle aged men or older have underlying
atherosclerosis not evident on a day-to-day basis,'' he said.
   People who most need to be aware of this have high blood
pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco addiction, or a family history
of heart disease, he said.
   If you are middle aged and don't have those risk factors, you
shouldn't have a problem with an exercise program that starts
slowly and progresses, Haskell said.
   But he still advises a visit to the doctor before starting an
exercise program.
   A stress test, in which a patient commonly exercises on a
treadmill while medical experts monitor the body's response, is a
common method to identify people with increased risk. But one
researcher says it's overdone.
   ``As a cardiologist, that's a financial boondoggle,'' said Dr.
Paul E. Thompson of Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I.
   Only a few people die because exercise triggered some underlying
condition, he said.
   In a 1982 study of deaths while jogging, Thompson, an associate
professor of medicine at Brown University, concluded Rhode Island
was averaging one man dead for every 7,620 men who jogged per year.
After eliminating the cases in which the joggers knew they had
heart disease, the study found only one death for each 15,600 men.
   Based on those figures, the stress test may not be worth the
$300 or so that it costs, he said.
   On the other hand, he said, pay attention to a tightness or
choking feeling in your chest: It's a sign of heart trouble.

<HEAD>Blood Substitute Shows Promise, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemical cousin of Teflon is showing promise as
a blood substitute in animals and may one day help stroke patients,
a researcher says.
   ``It's chemically pretty inert - pretty non-toxic - (and) could
be stored fairly easily without fear of contamination with virus or
bacteria or dirt,'' said Robert A. Linsenmeier, associate professor
of biomedical engineering and neurobiology and physiology at
Northwestern University.
   The blood substitute is made of a class of chemicals called
fluorocarbons. Teflon is also a fluorocarbon, a carbon-based
compound in which most or all hydrogen ions have been replaced by
fluorine atoms, Linsenmeier said.
   Different fluorocarbons have different physical properties, he
said, adding that the blood substitute he and his colleagues are
testing is a thick, milky fluid made by Alliance Pharmaceutical
Corp. of San Diego.
   In stroke patients, doctors may one day be able to inject some
of the artificial blood soon after the stroke and boost the oxygen
supply to affected brain tissue.
   The findings in tests on eight cats by Linsenmeier and Thomas K.
Goldstick, professor of chemical engineering and biomedical
engineering, were to be presented this month by their
co-researcher, Rod Braun, at the annual meeting of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers in Chicago.
   Now, only one form of artificial blood is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for use in humans - a fluorocarbon emulsion
called Fluosol, said Gary Schaer, director of the cardiac
catheterization laboratory at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical
Center in Chicago.
   But Fluosol is not effective in general transfusions, he said.
It is only useful in tiny quantities to keep heart muscle supplied
with oxygen during cardiac angioplasty.
   Schaer cautioned that any type of artificial blood still
undergoing only animal tests is years away from potential use in
humans.

<HEAD>Genes May Be Key to Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 percent of people probably carry a genetic
susceptibility to the most common forms of skin cancer no matter
how fair their skin is, researchers reported.
   Scientists from the University of Miami and the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Miami reported in the Journal of
Investigative Dermatology that there is a genetically distinct
group inclined to develop skin cancer.
   Scientists have known for some time that too much sun can cause
skin cancer, but the research team concluded a genetic
predisposition in tandem with overexposure also may play a role.
   Dr. Howard Koh, associate professor of dermatology and medicine
and public health at Boston University, was not familiar with the
study but noted the importance of such research.
   ``Skin cancer is the No. 1 cancer in the United States estimated
at up to 600,000 cases a year,'' Koh said. ``Non-melanoma skin
cancer rarely kills a person but its impact on quality of life and
the morbidity of it is really considerable.''
   Dr. J. Richard Taylor and colleagues studied people using
ultraviolet light exposure and a drug to test the body's immune
response. Neither the drug nor short bursts of ultraviolet light
exposure were harmful to study participants, he said.
   Study subjects who never had skin cancer developed a rash that
showed they had the immune system cells needed to fight a
cancer-causing assault. None of the volunteers who previously had
cancer developed the rash, Taylor said.

   A federal bankruptcy judge kept Eastern Airlines
alive Wednesday night by allowing the carrier to withdraw $15
million from an escrow fund.
   The judge, however, expressed doubts the struggling carrier's
recovery plans will work.
   Eastern's trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., asked U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland to let the airline tap $30 million out of
an escrow account immediately. Shugrue also said Eastern will need
to get another $40 million in late December and $10 million in
early January. The account presently has $273.6 million, he said.

   DETROIT (AP) - Early November sales of North American-made
vehicles rose a slim 2.4 percent despite a drop in sales of
gas-gulping light trucks, the automakers said.
   Sales of trucks, which until this year had been increasing
steadily since the mid-1980s, have been falling off as gas prices
rise in the wake of the Middle East crisis. The increase during the
Nov. 1-10 period this year, announced Wednesday, came against a
relatively weak period last year when customers shied away from
showrooms featuring new 1990 models with sticker prices higher than

   Kuwait Airways soon plans to resume service into
the United States as it expands symbolic efforts to keep flying,
even though occupying Iraqis have pirated most of the oil-rich
emirate's jet fleet.
   ``It's a mini-operation,'' said Gerard Tateossian, manager of
the government-owned airline's U.S. offices. ``We can still run our
airline and have the Kuwaiti flag flying all over the world.''
   After Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, they seized the
airport in Kuwait City along with 15 planes from the fleet of 23
once held by Kuwait Airways, Tateossian said. The eight jets still
in the fleet are the ones that happened to be out of the country.
   ``Fifteen of them have been looted by aggressors, taken away to
Baghdad,'' Tateossian said. ``There is no place else they can go.
We have indications that there is nothing at the Kuwait airport.''
   Kuwait Airways announced through newspaper advertisements
Wednesday that it soon would resume service to New York, one of its
key foreign destinations.
   ``Until we're able to welcome you to Kuwait, welcome aboard,''
the ad states. It calls the new service ``a symbol of the
perseverance of Kuwait.''
   ``We resumed operations already out of Cairo to the Gulf on the
18th of October,'' Tateossian said in a telephone interview. ``We
will be resuming out of the United States sometime at the end of
this month or the beginning of December.''
   The New York flights will include twice-weekly trips from
Kennedy airport to London, Bahrain and Bombay, he said. There will
be an additional flight leaving once a week that goes from Kennedy
to London, Cairo, Bahrain and Bombay.
   The flights will be handled by crews who were with the planes
that escaped the invasion, as well as some workers who got out on
their own, Tateossian said.
   Kuwait Airways said its ticketing offices in Washington,
Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto remain open. Those cities
were never destinations.
   The state-run carrier is now an airline without a country, as
its corporate offices are set up in Cairo and its hub is now
Bahrain.
   Previous service into various African, European and Asian
destinations has not been restored.
   Kuwait Airways hopes it can make its skeletal service turn a
profit, but the U.S. manager said the most important consideration
is to just show that it can still fly.
   ``The first operations were up to 54 percent occupancy,''
Tateossian said.

<HEAD>Icahn May Seek Seats on USX Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn, USX Corp.'s largest
shareholder is threatening to seek seats on the giant steel and
energy company's board if it ignores his latest call for
restructuring.
   In a letter to USX Corp. Chairman Charles Corry, Icahn praised
plans announced last month to transfer its steel operations into a
separate company. Those plans could result in a sale of the steel
division, the biggest steelmaker in the country.
   But Icahn called on USX to distribute the proceeds from the sale
of the steel business to shareholders as a special dividend.
   ``My USX stock is not for sale, and I will not even consider
selling it until USX supports a meaningful restructuring plan that
benefits all shareholders,'' Icahn said in his letter.
   The letter, dated Nov. 13, was disclosed Wednesday in an Icahn
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
   A spokesman for USX, Don Herring, said the company had no
comment on the matter.
   USX stock closed at $32.12{, up 37{ cents at the end of trading
Wednesday.
   Icahn, a takeover strategist who runs Trans World Airlines, has
been a thorn in the side of USX management for years. He had been
laying low since last May, when his proposal to spin off most of
the USX steel business in the form of a shareholder dividend was
rejected by other stockholders.
   Icahn has said he considers steel a drain on USX's Marathon Oil
Co. and Texas Oil and Gas Co.
   Icahn, who controls 13.3 percent of USX's common stock, said he
was creating an independent committee to ``assist all stockholders
of the company in having meaningful input'' on issues such as
separating the steel and energy businesses, dividend policy and
corporate governance.
   The committee, consisting of law, government and business
professors at Harvard and Stanford universities and the University
of Chicago, would seek election to the board of directors at the
1991 annual meeting ``unless the USX board adopts a meaningful
restructuring plan and corporate governance changes,'' according to
Icahn's five-page letter to Corry.
   Icahn also said the committee would seek a shareholders' list
and begin canvassing USX shareholders as soon as practical about
its proposals, which include the possible sale of all or part of
its energy operations; and eliminating the shareholder rights plan,
or ``poison pill'' defense against possible takeovers.

<HEAD>Colorful Figure in Boesky Scandal Gets Prison, $1.68 Billion Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge gave John A. Mulheren Jr. a
366-day prison term and a $1.68 million fine for stock
manipulation, saying the former friend of famous Wall Street felon
Ivan Boesky deserved incarceration.
   ``Anyone who tampers with the integrity of the stock market will
go to prison,'' Judge Miriam Cedarbaum decreed Wednesday in
pronouncing sentence on Mulheren, a flamboyant 41-year-old
speculator convicted with Boesky's help.
   When asked for his reaction to the sentence, Mulheren responded
in the same easy-going manner with which he conducted himself
during his trial: ``Nobody likes to go to jail, right?''
   Mulheren's prosecution received widespread attention because it
featured Boesky's first public testimony in Wall Street's insider
trading scandals. He was freed pending appeal of the charges.
   He was the only person implicated by Boesky - the ex-speculator
whose admissions led to several prominent indictments - to go to
trial rather than strike a plea agreement.
   A jury in July found Mulheren guilty of charges he helped Boesky
drive up the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. stock in 1985. He faced a
maximum of 20 years in prison.
   If his conviction is upheld, it is unlikely Mulheren will serve
the entire sentence because he will be eligible for parole after
serving four months. Cedarbaum also gave Mulheren credit for time
served in 1988 in connection with an alleged plot to shoot Boesky.
   Mulheren's attorney, Thomas Puccio, said he believed Mulheren
was in federal custody for about two months for that incident,
which later was settled with Mulheren agreeing to three years of
probation.
   Mulheren did not address the court before sentencing. He relied
on statements by Puccio, who asked for leniency because Mulheren
suffered from manic depression and because of his many charitable
acts.
   ``The most we have here is someone who momentarily strayed and
committed one act on one day against a lifetime of honesty and
respectability,'' Puccio said.
   Prosecutors had charged that Mulheren bought 75,000 Gulf &amp;
Western shares at Boesky's behest, driving the stock to $45 a
share, the price at which Boesky wanted to sell about 3.5 million
shares back to the company.
   Cedarbaum said the fine of $1.68 million represented the losses
sustained by investors who bought Gulf &amp; Western stock during the
time of the manipulation.
   Boesky agreed in November 1986 to plead guilty to one count of
lying to federal investigators and pay $100 million in fines. He
was released from federal custody in April after serving two years
of a three-year term.
   The high point of the trial came when Boesky was called as a
prosecution witness against Mulheren, his former business associate
and friend. Boesky admitted in testimony that he traded suitcases
stuffed with cash for confidential information about imminent
takeovers.
   Mulheren, a laid-back multimillionaire who often flew by
helicopter to his trial, flouted convention in court as he had in
his Wall Street career. During testimony, Mulheren wore a tennis
shirt, blue jeans and boat shoes.
   At sentencing, Mulheren also dressed casually in an open-necked
pink shirt and khaki pants.
   In 1988, after learning Boesky had implicated him, Mulheren was
arrested leaving his Rumson, N.J., mansion carrying a loaded
assault rifle and army fatigues. Police said he planned to shoot
Boesky.
   State authorities in New Jersey last year dropped weapons
possession charges against Mulheren as a part of the settlement
that included probation. Mulheren's lawyers blamed the incident on
his failure to take lithium prescribed to treat manic depression.
   Some criminal charges against Mulheren remain because the jury
was unable to reach a verdict on 26 additional counts of securities
fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping violations.
   Cedarbaum declared a mistrial on that portion of the case and
the government has yet to decide whether to retry Mulheren on the
pending counts.
   Mulheren's co-defendant, Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader
at Mulheren's defunct firm Jamie Securities Co., was acquitted of
all conspiracy and record-keeping violations charges brought
against him.

<HEAD>Early-November Sales Up, Despite Big Chrysler Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers reported a 2.4 percent rise in
the number of North American-made cars and trucks sold in early
November, despite a big decline posted by Chrysler Corp.
   Within hours Wednesday of Chrysler reporting a 21.3 percent
decline in its vehicle sales during the period, the struggling
automaker issued a new incentive package including cash rebates on
all of its minivans. It's the second time in history that's been
done.
   Chrysler's car sales fell 9.1 percent while sales of its trucks,
including the company's minivan line, plummeted 33 percent.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, said their
car and truck sales during the Nov. 1-10 period rose 7.4 percent
and 4.7 percent respectively, compared with the same time last
year.
   Combined, the Big Three and the seven Japanese companies selling
cars and trucks made in North America said their average daily
sales rate rose to 26,817 vehicles during the period this year
compared with a rate of 26,194 a day in early November last year.
   Car sales jumped 8 percent over a relatively weak period last
year, but truck sales dropped 6.4 percent, mainly because of the
sag in Chrysler sales.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said Wednesday the truck sales
declines were noted across-the-board, with no one particular
vehicle suffering a significantly larger slump than others.
   Shortly after reporting its car and truck sales, Chrysler issued
a new incentive program that included rebates on standard-wheelbase
minivans. Chrysler has commanded a lion's share of the minivan
market ever since it introduced its popular vehicles in late 1983.
   But recently, as the number of companies marketing minivans in
the United States has grown, Chrysler's share of the market has
shrunk. Nonetheless, the company still controls more than 45
percent of the market.
   Chrysler said it would offer a $1,000 discount on 1989 and 1990
models of its popular minivans between now and Dec. 16. Previously,
the company offered $500 cash rebates on extra-length minivans.
That incentive also was boosted to $1,000.
   Jakobowski said as much as 40 percent of the minivans sold
during the early-November period were 1989 or 1990 models. Chrysler
shut down its two minivan assembly plants for a month apiece to
retool for 1991 models, which cut supplies of the newly redesigned
models.
   Also on Wednesday, Chrysler boosted rebates on its Jeep line of
sport-utility vehicles and some of its Jeep and Dodge pickup
trucks.
   The only other time Chrysler has offered a rebate on its
minivans, which were introduced in late 1983, was during a six-week
period beginning in mid-December last year. Sales of the popular
light trucks soared during the rebate period, but plummeted when
the rebates expired.
   The early-November sales period last year was one of the weakest
of 1989. Many consumers who had planned to buy cars in the fourth
quarter of last year pushed up their purchases to the third quarter
to take advantage of incentives and avoid price increases due with
the 1990 models.
   Incentives still are in effect, but they don't have the drawing
power they once had.
   So far this year, car and truck sales by the 10 companies have
dropped 3.6 percent compared with last year, with car sales down
3.8 percent and truck sales 3.3 percent.

<HEAD>Man Who Won Computer Chip Patent Says He's Done it Again</HEAD>

   Gilbert Hyatt, the engineer who was granted a
patent last summer for the computer microprocessor after a 20-year
battle, says he's done it again.
   Hyatt announced Wednesday at the Comdex Computer Show that he
recently received a patent for a technology that triples the speed
of one of the most widely used types of computer chips.
   Hyatt said his modification of Dynamic Random Access Memory
chips, or DRAM, eliminates unnecessary operations in the chips to
achieve the greater speed.
   DRAMs are among the most common types of computer chips, used in
products ranging from personal computers to printers to some home
electronics equipment.
   They temporarily store bits of data that are needed to perform
various operations.
   By speeding them up, computers could perform calculations more
quickly. That's because the speed of microprocessors, the
``brains'' of personal computers, has outpaced the ability of DRAMs
to feed them data.
   Hyatt said he plans to license the technology to the computer
industry, much like he is seeking licenses for his 1968 invention
of the microprocessor.
   One industry analyst, Millard Phelps, of the San Francisco
brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said Hyatt's latest invention could be
a major advance - provided his chips don't have too many drawbacks.
   ``It sure makes you wonder what is the tradeoff,'' Phelps said.
   Hyatt, however, said he achieved the speedup without sacrificing
any other characteristics of the chips. He said he uses
off-the-shelf DRAMs in his technique.
   Hyatt said he plans to use any royalties he receives from his
two patents to help other small inventors. He said small inventors
tend to get trampled by major companies and overlooked by the
government.
   ``I hope to do my part in helping the little guy from what I
learned in my 20-year fight,'' he said.
   Hyatt, of La Palma, Calif., fought with the U.S. Patent Office
and major computer chip makers until he was granted his
microprocessor patent in July.
   The patent award called into question the computer industry's
official history, which says the microprocessor was invented by
several Intel Corp. scientists.
   Hyatt declined to comment on the amount of royalties he was
seeking on the patent, beyond calling them ``significant.''
Industry analysts estimate he could get several million dollars a
year from major microprocessor makers.
   Hyatt has said that he sought his patent more to set history
straight than for riches. He said he has earned a living by
consulting to the aerospace industry while continuing to work on
inventions in his home lab and seeking the patents.
   Despite his long ordeal with the microprocessor, Hyatt supports
the cumbersome U.S. patent-granting system.
   ``It's to the credit of the patent system that eventually right
prevails,'' he said.

   Pan Am Corp. finalized its deal to sell
important trans-Atlantic routes to UAL Corp. in a $400 million
package that will give United Airlines a strong presence flying
across two oceans.
   Now, United might run into troubles with the British bureaucracy
as it seeks to keep flying the old Pan Am routes into Heathrow
Airport, the most desirable destination in London. Some airline
analysts believe the British will insist that United fly into
Gatwick Airport instead.
   The Teamsters union at Pan Am had also voiced objections to the
deal, saying the struggling carrier was not getting enough cash for
the London routes. But Pan Am said the deal also involved a
marketing agreement through which the rival airlines will
coordinate some flights and attempt to feed passengers to one
another.
   The two carriers signed the final papers on the deal late
Wednesday night, the deadline for its completion, Pan Am spokesman
Jeff Kriendler said. The airlines did immediately release details
of pact as it was announced early today.
   The agreement was put in question over the weekend when it was
announced that TWA had proposed merging with Pan Am if the
arrangement with United fell through. If the papers hadn't been
signed by Wednesday, the United deal could have been terminated and
TWA's offer might have come into play.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn offered Pan Am securities with a face
value of $300 million and $150 million in cash if it didn't sell
the routes to United's parent, UAL Corp.
   Completing the deal marks a major expansion by UAL. United
bought Pan Am's prized Pacific routes five years ago for $750
million and has since become a key airline in that part of the
world.
   The deal, originally announced late last month, provides for UAL
to acquire Pan Am's U.S.-London routes, except for those from Miami
and Detroit.
   It also provides for UAL to buy gates, hangar and office space
at San Francisco and Washington's Dulles International airport, two
Boeing 747 jumbo jets and spare parts.
   Also Wednesday, federal transportation officials gave final
approval to United's planned new routes between Chicago and Tokyo.
The Department of Transportation approved the routes over the
objections of American Airlines, which had sought to offer the
service.
   Pan Am has said it will concentrate on one major European hub,
Frankfurt, as well as strengthen schedules to other European
cities, including Oslo, Zagreb, Hamburg, Amsterdam and Nuremberg.
   In addition, Pan Am has said it will increase its Miami presence
by adding long-haul flights from that city to Latin America.
   The agreement with UAL also includes reciprocal participation in
each other's frequent flier programs and coordination of their
schedules at Miami, as well as to Central and South America from
the West Coast.

<HEAD>GM Fighting Tariff on Canadian-Built Geo Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is in a dispute with the
U.S. Treasury Department over whether its Canadian-built Geo
Tracker sport-utility vehicle or the Geo Metro subcompact car
should be subject to tariffs.
   At issue is whether the Tracker or Metro, built at a joint
GM-Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, have more
than 50 percent of their value attributable to U.S. or Canadian
labor.
   If the vehicles comply and have more than 50 percent North
American content, they enter the United States without tariffs.
   Most of the engines and transmissions for GM's Geo line of small
vehicles come from Japan.
   The Treasury Department said the Tracker and Metro don't comply
with the North American content rule. GM disagrees, saying the
content level should include the costs of borrowing money for the
factory.
   ``It's very real and, in our case, it was borrowed from a
variety of institutions in Canada and in the U.S.,'' said James
Cameron, a spokesman for the CAMI Automotive Inc. joint
manufacturing plant in Ingersoll.
   If the Tracker is classified as having less than 50 percent
North American content, it would be subject to a 25 percent truck
tariff and the Metro could be hit with a 2.5 percent car tariff.
   If the levies were applied, it could cost GM $75 million for the
29,000 Trackers and 27,000 Metros it brought into the United States
from Canada during the 1990 model year, according to John Simpson,
a deputy assistant secretary for the Treasury Department.
   Other automakers' vehicles made in Ontario contain have more
than 50 percent North American content. They include the Civic made
by Honda Motor Co. Ltd. in Allison, the Corolla made by Toyota
Motor Corp. in Cambridge, the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand
Marquis made by Ford Motor Co. in St. Thomas; and the Dodge Monaco
and Eagle Premier made by Chrysler Corp. in Bramalea.

   The newest gadgets that box, sort, tape and
buffer are on display at a packaging industry trade show that looks
grass-green in its support of sound environmental policies.
   ``It's the environmental revolution,'' said Craig Todd, district
manager of Better Packages. ``Everybody's gotten on the
bandwagon.''
   Better Packages isn't offering a new product at the show but is
exhibiting new packaging for its old products.
   The Shelton, Conn., company's tape machines, which use glue
rather than adhesives which don't decompose, ``just happen to be
the right thing at the right time,'' Todd said.
   More than 55,000 people were on hand Wednesday for the packaging
industry's Pack Expo, which ends Friday at McCormick Place.
   Dozens of this year's 900 exhibitors included environmentally
sensible products, which ran from mailing envelopes made of
recycled materials to packaging ``peanuts'' made nearly entirely of
cornstarch.
   The new ``peanuts,'' manufactured by American Excelsior Co. of
Arlington, Texas, will give the environmentally conscious consumer
an alternative to the standard polystyrene packaging peanut, the
company said.
   The product, called Eco-Foam, is more than 95 percent
cornstarch, and the rest is a water-soluble organic polymer, said
Robert Asselin of National Starch and Chemical Co. of Bridgewater
N.J. It handles the peanuts' production for American Excelsior.
   The product dissolves in water and is safe enough to eat, said
Asselin, who did just that while chatting with a reporter.
   American Excelsior will keep making polystyrene peanuts, said
company Vice President Ken Starrett.
   ``We've serviced this market for about 30 years or more,'' said
Starrett. ``We're not competing with ourselves, and we don't see a
conflict by making both products. Eco-Foam is still the newcomer to
the market.''
   Some companies said thir customers aren't fully converted to
the idea that environmentally sound is best.
   ``They'll buy it if the cost is the same and the quality's the
same. But if the price is higher or the quality's affected, forget
it,'' said Peter Dauphinais, whose company, Polyair Corp.,
introduced ``Eco-Lite'' mailing envelopes this year.
   The envelopes are made from 100 percent recycled paper and
plastic and, while they cost the same as non-recycled, they're less
strong, said Dauphinais, sales man for the Toronto company.
   Cantech Industries Inc., of Johnson City, Tenn., introduced a
new unbleached masking tape at the show.
   The new tape is free of caustic chemicals used in other tape
manufacture but is not quite as white as its bleached counterpart,
said Cantech's Jim Petruzzi.
   Petruzzi said manufacturers tend to have a natural inclination
toward packaging materials which are the newest and white-est of
whites - a tendency that dies hard.
   ``You spend your whole life on making things look good, then
environmental issues come up,'' said Petruzzi. ``Not that they're
not good issues.''

   The stock market declined broadly today, giving
up some of the gains recorded in its rally since mid-October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.90 to 2,549.75
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 267 up, 709
down and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.03 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Oil prices turned upward and interest rates rose in early
activity in the commodity and credit markets.
   Analysts said that provided stock traders with an incentive to
cash in some of their recent gains.
   The recovery in stock prices has been based to a considerable
degree on expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon take new
steps to relax its credit policy.
   Some observers believe that any likely Fed action has been
largely ``discounted,'' or taken into account in advance, by the
market's rise of late.
   Losers among the early volume leaders included Wal-Mart Stores,
down &rsqb; at 29; General Motors, down \ at 39|; International Business
Machines, down { at 113, and Toys R Us, down \ at 23{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .88 to 173.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .50 at 297.37.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.25 points
to 2,559.65.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by almost 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,001 up, 521 down and 468 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 179.31 million shares, up from 160.24
million in the previous session.

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. officials deny allegations of
fraud in selling Lomas Financial Corp. securities and said Harvard
University, one of nine accusers, had access to reports Lomas was
not doing well before buying.
   In a suit against Merrill Lynch, Harvard said the brokerage firm
concealed its own $40 million stake in Texas-based Lomas while
selling Lomas securities.
   Harvard bought $45 million of Lomas notes in May 1989, one month
before Lomas announced a $200 million loss.
   ``Lomas' problems were not kept secret from the financial
markets or the Harvard Management Co.'s managers,'' Merrill Lynch
spokesman Fred Yeager said Wednesday.
   He said Harvard had access to all material negative developments
before it purchased, and received a private placement memorandum
describing Lomas' poor financial results and its intewntion to
undertake restructuring transactions.
   He said Merrill Lynch's stake in Lomas was documented in
Securities and Exchange filings one month before Harvard invested
in the company.
   Trial of the suit by Harvard and eight other institutional
investors will be held in U.S. District Court in Boston and is
expected to begin in the spring.

Union $400 million to buy steel pipes and pay for goods imported
from Japan, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported
Thursday.
   Nihon Keizai said the loans were extended to the Soviet
government-owned Soviet Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs, but did
not identify the Japanese banks. It also did not report the
interest rate, but said the loans would be repaid in 10
installments over five years.
   The Soviet Union is to use half of the money to pay for
industrial materials it has bought from Japan and the rest to
import 105,000 tons of seamless pipes and 80,000 tons of
large-diameter steel pipes for the development of oil resources,
Nihon Keizai said.
   An official of the Finance Ministry, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, declined to confirm the report, saying, ``It is our
policy not to answer on any private cases.''
   Foreign Ministry officials have said Japan will not extend
financial assistance to the Soviet Union until the Kremlin agrees
to return a group of northern islands seized by the Soviet Union at
the end of World War II.

   Soybean futures prices rose slightly today on the
Chicago Board of Trade, recovering from several sessions of
double-digit losses in some active contract months. Grains were
mostly lower.
   Soybean prices rose initially on speculation that some type of
U.S.-European food aid package to the Soviet Union would result
from President Bush's impending trip to Europe.
   Soybeans continued to face pressure, however, from a government
report issued last week that found larger stocks of the crop than
had been expected.
   Followthrough selling in wheat, corn and oats came from
Wednesday's sharp losses. Little export activity and bountiful
crops were blamed for the losses.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2 cents to 1} cents lower

<HEAD>Violent Novel `American Psycho' Canceled by Publisher</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede WASHINGTON</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with publisher confirming
cancellation; author's publicist raises censorship question.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster said today it
will not release ``American Psycho,'' a violent new novel by
critically acclaimed author Bret Easton Ellis.
   Chairman Richard E. Snyder released a statement saying the book,
which was scheduled to be shipped to stores next month, would not
handle be handled by Simon &amp; Schuster. Ellis' publicist said the
decision smacks of censorship.
   ```American Psycho' is not a book that Simon &amp; Schuster is
willing to publish even though Mr. Ellis is a serious author whose
work Simon &amp; Schuster has previously published,'' Snyder said.
   Ellis, 26, is the author of the critically praised novel ``Less
Than Zero,'' which depicts a morally decadent lifestyle among
children of upper-income families in Los Angeles. It was made into
a movie in 1987.
   The statement offered no further explanation for the book's
cancellation. But Snyder told The Washington Post: ``In my opinion,
there was an incorrect decision'' by editors who bought the book
and approved its publication.
   ``American Psycho,'' the story of a young, successful Wall
Street businessman who can't stop killing people, was criticized
for its vivid descriptions of violence against women.
   Ellis' publicist, Amanda Urban, said, ``Refusing to publish a
book at this 11th hour, without explanation, raises the question
whether there was a form of censorship going on here.''
   ``What is involved here is a giant corporation responding to
pre-publication controversy and strong-arming its publishing
division into abandoning its own tradition of fearless
publication,'' Urban said.
   Snyder denied he was pressured into canceling the book by the
publishing house's parent company, Paramount Communications Inc.
   ``It was I who decided we should not put our name on this book.
It's a matter of taste,'' Snyder told the Washington Post. He said
Paramount agreed with his decision.
   ``Through the press, I became aware of this book, and then aware
of its contents,'' Snyder said. ``And it was I who decided we
should not put our name on this book. It's a matter of taste.''
   Urban said other publishers have expressed interest in the book.
She declined to give names while negotiating. She said Ellis does
not have to give back his advance, which today's Wall Street
Journal put at $300,000.
   Snyder said Martin Davis, chairman of the publishing house's
parent company, Paramount Communications Inc., agreed with the
decision.
   Ellis was quoted by The Washington Post as conceding that some
scenes in his novel ``are appalling'' but added that some magazine
accounts of it ``verged on the hysterical and gave a false sense of
what the book is about.'' The violence is there because ``the
character is crazy,'' he said.
   ``The book is 400 pages long, and there are less than 40 pages
with the type of mayhem they quote,'' Ellis said.

   The court-appointed administrators brought in to

auctioneers to sell the contents of the British conglomerate's
headquarters.
   The items to be sold by Phillips auctioneers are mostly fine
furniture and paintings from Polly Peck's board, conference and
waiting rooms, said one of the administrators, accountant Michael
Jordan of the firm Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte.
   Jordan said he hoped the sale planned for February would yield

running the company.
   The food and electronics company, headed by Turkish Cypriot

its debt of 1.3 billion pounds, or $2.5 billion.

<HEAD>State's High Court Upholds Auto Lemon Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state's automobile-lemon law, designed
to protect consumers who purchase defective new motor vehicles, was
upheld today by a unanimous state Supreme Court.
   The law had been challenged by the Ford Motor Co., which
contended it violates the equal protection and due process
provisions of the state and U.S. constitutions.
   ``The state's interest in protecting consumers in the purchase
of motor vehicles under the motor vehicles warranties law outweighs
the due process considerations,'' Justice Charles Smith wrote for
the court.
   The case stemmed from Ford's appeal to the King County Superior
Court of a New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board ruling in favor of
Gary Barrett.
   Barrett bought a Ford Thunderbird from Mossy Ford in Bellevue in
September 1985. He went to the arbitration board after the dealer
was unable to repair a steering problem that caused the vehicle to
pull to the left.
   The board ordered Ford to buy the vehicle back from Barrett.
   Ford conceded that the steering defect constituted a serious
safety defect.
   But the automaker appealed, asking that Barrett's claim be
denied on merits and contending the requirement that it repurchase
the vehicle was unconstitutional.
   Superior Court Judge Patricia Aitken disagreed. She ordered Ford
to pay Barrett $7,125, representing the repurchase cost less offset
for use; $7,000 for Ford's failure to provide free use of a
comparable loaner vehicle pending resolution of the appeal; and
$1,750 for attorney's fees.
   In its appeal of tht decision to the state's high court, Ford
contended that requiring it to pay attorney fees and a
loaner-vehicle fee constituted the singling out of ``a class of
litigants and subjecting them to onerous penalties as a condition
of seeking redress within the court system.''
   Ford also complained that if had prevailed in its superior court
appeal, Barrett could not have been forced to pay attorney fees.
The company said that represented denial of equal protection under
the law for Ford and discouraged the filing of appeals.
   Smith noted, however, that the law designates two classes,
manufacturers and consumers, and that the consumer class is not
held liable for fees incurred in an appeal.
   Smith held that the separation of classes was rational. And he
brushed aside Ford's argument that the law might discourage all
appeals by manufacturers.
   He said Ford had not effectively demonstrated that the law was
not rationally related to its purpose.
   ``Equal protection does not require that legislative efforts be
perfect,'' Smith wrote, adding: ``The state's interest in (consumer
protection) outweighs any deterrent effect on manufacturers.''

<HEAD>Eastern Dodges Death Threat, Trustee Blasts Creditors As Reckless</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with quotes from Shugrue at news conference.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Eastern Airlines predicted today
that the embattled carrier would strengthen soon and he denounced
the creditors who sought to choke off its life-giving supply of
cash in a bankruptcy-court brawl.
   ``Their actions in public and in the media are nothing short of
reckless and shameful. They have set back our recovery efforts,''
Eastern trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr. told a news conference, a day
after he convinced a bankruptcy judge to release more money from a
$273.6 million escrow fund to keep Eastern operating.
   Shugrue also said he believed that Eastern, one of the country's
oldest, biggest and most troubled airlines, ``will stay on the path
to profitability and will continue to maintain the support of the
court.''
   The airline's creditors wanted U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland to deny Eastern any more money, force it to close and
auction off whatever assets remain to help pay its enormous debts.
   Analysts say Eastern has a total accumulated debt of some $2.5
billion.
   At a packed hearing that lasted nearly nine hours Wednesday
night, the creditors and Eastern officials sparred over whether the
airline could survive, especially in view of the nation's economic
downturn and a dramatic rise in fuel prices caused by the
3-month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   Burton finally ruled Eastern could have $15 million immediately,
half of what it requested through late December. The judge said
he'd release another $15 million if Eastern's projections were on
track as of early December.
   Burton said he was making ``a close call'' with his ruling. He
also said Eastern could revise performance estimates to account for
any harm that comes from news stories written about creditor
attempts to liquidate the airline.
   ``There's a great sense of relief,'' Eastern spokesman Jim
Ashlock said Wednesday night after a judge approved the life-saving
infusion. ``This was the big one.''
   Eastern was taking steps today to assure its 18,000 employees
that they would still be flying, at least for now.
   The brush with near death was the latest in a history of trauma
at Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court
protection since March 1989 when most employees struck in a bitter
dispute with management over concessions to save money. Eastern
hired strike replacements and is a much smaller airline now, but it
is still suffering staggering losses of about $1 million a day.
   In addition to the $30 million Shugrue requested for December,
he also said during the hearing that the airline probably will need
another $40 million in late December and an additional $10 million
in January before it can turn the corner and halt losses that have
come to about $1 million daily.
   Shugrue said Eastern will be able to repay the fund with even
more cash by February. But the unsecured creditors' committee said
it put no faith in his plans for resurrecting the carrier.
   The creditors say Eastern's plans are based on an assumption
that fuel prices will drop, as well as Shugrue's contention that he
will be able to take business away from his more healthy
competitors through a program that offers first-class service at
coach class rates.
   The creditors said fuel costs are likely to keep rising, but the
judge faulted them for making a court filing on Tuesday that
included news stories about a dramatic rise in oil prices late last
week. The creditors left out subsequent news stories that showed
oil falling sharply over the next couple of days.
   Eastern even pointed out that one of the creditors' expert
witnesses has even been quoted in at least two recent news stories
as saying oil prices are likely to fall.
   ``Your speculation and your arguments about prices may be no
better than theirs,'' the judge told lawyers for the creditors, who
include banks, airplane companies and labor unions.
   The creditors said Eastern's competitors will find ways to
compete with the first-class program, and they are particularly
motivated to do so as the airline industry endures hard times amid
high fuel prices and a sluggish economy.
   Shugrue said Eastern has failed to meet his previous projections
for business improvements because of the unpredictable downturn in
the U.S. economy and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.
   Alan S. Boyd, chairman of the creditors' committee and chairman
of airplane-maker Airbus Industrie Holdings of North America,
stopped short of saying the judge's ruling will delay the
inevitable death of Eastern.
   ``How this process will work out, God only knows,'' Boyd said,
speaking to reporters outside the courthouse.
   The judge said in issuing his ruling that Shugrue had shown
reasonable business judgment in asking for the additional money.
   ``I'm not sure the creditors' committee has exercised business
judgment superior to that of the trustee,'' Lifland said.
   The hearing coincided with the release of Eastern's earnings
statement for the third quarter of 1990, which showed the airline
lost $252.8 million, bringing its total loss for the year to $424.9
million.

Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said Thursday.
   The order includes nine 747-400s and 16 737-300s, Boeing said.
   Contracts for three of the 747s and eight 737s were signed
Thursday. The remainder were ordered last year but not announced
until now, Boeing said.
   The airline plans to use the 737s on routes around the Indonesia
islands and the 747s for international routes.
   The 737s will be powered by CFM56-3 engines from CFM
International, and the 747s by CF6-80C2 engines from General
Electric Co.
   The latest order brings to 1,118 the number of all 747 models
ordered, and to 2,880 the number of all 737 models ordered.
   So far this year, Boeing has received orders for 485 jetliners
of all types worth a total of about $43 billion.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Rules for Policyholders in Environmental
Clean-up Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Insurance companies, and not the polluters
they insure, must pay the costs of government-ordered toxic waste
cleanups, the state Supreme Court ruled today.
   The unanimous decision was a major victory for corporate
policyholders over insurers, who argued cleanup costs were excluded
from coverage. A lawyer for the manufacturer whose waste dump sites
were at issue in the case said the ruling would also protect the
public.
   By providing insurance coverage for a company's own cleanup
costs in response to government orders, the ruling should encourage
``a quicker cleanup and a less costly one, and the likelihood of a
more complete one,'' said David Steuber, an attorney for FMC Corp.
   Otherwise, he said, companies might wait until government
agencies performed the cleanup and sued them for the costs.
   FMC, a Chicago-based chemical and weapons company, had been sued
by federal and local agencies for allegedly polluting the land and
water at 79 toxic waste sites in at least 22 states.
   The costs of those projects have been estimated at $250 million
or more. Insurance company lawyers in the case have said more than
$2 billion in similar costs was at stake in 17 pending toxic
cleanup cases in California.
   The ruling resolved a split in lower state courts over whether a
polluter or the insurers who provide coverage for property damage
should pay for the costs of removing hazardous substances from the
environment.
   Standard insurance policies require insurers to cover all costs
that the policyholder ``shall become legally obligated to pay as
damages because of property damage.''
   FMC's insurers argued the policies did not cover costs of
cleaning up pollution in response to government orders issued under
environmental laws, or costs of repaying the government for its own
expenses. The insurers said ``damages'' referred only to money
awarded for injuries in a jury trial, and not to remedial costs
paid under government order.
   The Supreme Court disagreed. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas wrote
that ``the plain and ordinary meanings'' of ``damages'' and other
words in the policies covered all types of expenses incurred in
response to government orders to repair property damage caused by
toxic discharges.
   Rejecting a key argument of the insurers, Lucas said the fact
that FMC was a large, sophisticated company did not affect the
usual principle that unclear language in an insurance policy must
be interpreted against the insurer who drafted it, and in favor of
coverage.

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Rep Warns of Tensions if Trade Talks Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
warned on Thursday that a failure of world trade talks would
increase tensions among trading partners and could even spill over
into foreign policy areas.
   ``We would be headed into a period of much greater friction,''
she said shortly after her arrival in Brussels for a series of
talks with European Community officials.
   She said it would be ``very difficult ... to maintain
international cooperation'' on issues ranging from the environment
to the Persian Gulf crisis ``if you are at each other's throats
over trade issues.''
   Mrs. Hills will join U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and other American officials on Friday in a fresh attempt to break
an impasse with the European Community over proposals to reduce
agricultural subsidies.
   ``We've got a stalemate and we've got a problem,'' she said.
   Earlier, Frans Andriessen, the community's top trade official,
said the trading bloc's proposal to trim farm subsidies on major
crops by 30 percent was negotiable.
   ``We never said, `Gentlemen, this is the Community's proposal.
Take it or leave it.' We want to negotiate. The EC is ready to take
these negotiations to a successful result,'' Andriessen told
reporters.
   The offer falls far short of the subsidy cuts being sought by
the EC's key trade partners, notably the United States, and has
raised questions about whether the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks can be completed in early December as scheduled.
   Andriessen spoke after European Community trade ministers
discussed the trade talks, involving 105 nations under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The negotiations,
which began in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, are designed to
overhaul the world trading system.
   The EC wants a 30 percent cut in farm subsidies over 10 years,
while the United States and other farm-exporting nations want to
slash payments by 75 percent.
   Washington also wants to reduce agricultural export subsidies by
90 percent over a decade, while the EC has not addressed export
subsidies.
   EC officials sought to play down the dispute on farm subsidies,
pointing out there are also disagreements in the 14 other areas
under negotiation in the talks.
   ``Our commitment is to negotiate seriously. What is at stake,
economically and politically, is quite a lot,'' said Renato
Ruggiero, the Italian trade minister and the meeting's chairman.
   Otto Schlecht, Germany's deputy trade minister, said ``a
successful end of the GATT round is extremely important'' to
safeguard an open world trading system.

<TEXT>
   President Bush proclaimed a ``new era for
clean air'' today as he signed far-reaching legislation placing new
curbs on air pollution from automobiles, factories and businesses.
   ``Every American expects and deserves to breathe clean air,''
Bush said, signing the Clean Air Act of 1990.
   He called the measure ``the centerpiece of our environmental
agenda'' and the ``most significant air pollution legislation in
our nation's history.''
   Bush signed the measure at an East Room ceremony, standing with
key lawmakers involved in the long and contentious fight over the
measure.
   ``This is a true red letter day for all Americans,'' Bush
declared. ``We begin a new era for clean air.''
   ``No American should have to drive out of town to have to
breathe clean air. Every city in America should have clean air. And
with this legislation, I firmly believe we will,'' he said.
   ``Mission defined, mission accomplished,'' he added.
   The bill, 748 pages long, will affect virtually every American.
It was approved by Congress easily last month, belying 16 months of
debate and long hours of behind-the-scenes negotiations on a myriad
of provisions.
   In advance of today's bill-signing, environmental groups were
hailing the bill's enactment. ``The Clean Air Act of 1990 is like a
breath of fresh air after a 10-year smog alert,'' said Sierra Club
President Susan Merrow.
   The law will require new pollution controls for automobiles,
electric utilities, factories and thousands of businesses. It
eventually is expected to cost the economy as much as $25 billion a
year, according to White House estimates.
   The legislation aims to cut acid rain pollutants by half,
sharply reduce urban smog and eliminate most of the toxic chemical
emissions from industrial plants by the turn of the century.
   Many environmentalists, although highly critical of the
president on an array of issues from wetland protection to global
warming, acknowledge the bill would have had little chance of
passage without Bush's support.
   Federal air pollution controls have not been changed since 1977.
Over the last 10 years, attempts to impose new requirements
repeatedly were stymied by strong opposition from various economic
and regional interests and the Reagan administration.
   Bush changed much of that by proposing in July 1989 a broad
rewrite of the federal clean air laws that set the stage for the
congressional debate.
   The act - approved by the Senate 89-10 and the House 401-25 -
will require automakers to install tougher emission controls and
service stations to sell cleaner-burning gasoline blends; force
thousands of businesses and factories to install new equipment to
capture smog-causing pollutants and toxic chemicals; and require
coal-burning power plants to cut in half sulfur dioxide emissions,
which cause acid rain.
   Some of the new requirements will begin to be phased in within a
few years, although most will not be fully in place until the end
of the decade. Some cities with the worst smog problems have as
long as 15 to 20 years to meet federal air requirements.
   The signing of the historic bill is expected to do little to
help Bush mend fences with an environmental community that has
become increasingly critical of the president.
   Bush ``has yet to prove he's an environmentalist,'' said Mike
Clark, president of Friends of the Earth.
   The clean air bill ``is his one and only significant
environmental achievement and he certainly is not entitled to take
sole credit for it,'' added George Frampton, president of the
Wilderness Society.
   Environmentalists have been critical of Bush for not moving more
aggressively to deal with global warming - an issue the president
maintains steadfastly has not had a thorough scientific
examination.
   While many industrial nations have established goals for
reducing global warming pollutants - primarily carbon dioxide from
the burning of fossil fuels - the administration has refused to
make any specific commitments.
   Environmentalists point to other issues on which, they say, the
administration's policies have been a disappointment.
   They cite the president's strong support for opening the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, slow
progress in developing a formal policy to protect wetlands, and
hints of wanting to re-examine the Endangered Species Act to take
economic issues more heavily into account.
   Last summer, Bush expressed irritation with environmentalists
and declared that their ``grading system is absolutely ...
absurd.''
   William Reilly, a longtime conservationist and head of the
Environmental Protection Agency, staunchly defends Bush's
environmental record and suggested the critics often judge Bush
against an unfair ``standard of perfection.''

<HEAD>Soybeans Stage Moderate Comeback, Grains Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybeans futures prices staged a moderate
comeback Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new
export business. Grains were mostly lower.
   Soybean prices firmed as speculation grew that a U.S.-European
food aid package to the Soviet Union would come out of President
Bush's upcoming trip to Europe.
   Soybeans futures were boosted later in the day after rumors
began circulating that the United States was preparing to offer
subsidized soybean meal to Pakistan, said Dan Cekander, an analyst
with Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   But the gains probably will be only short-term, Cekander said.
   ``We've had so many rumors of aid, and they never pan out,'' he
said. ``I expect to see further liquidation because the market
wants to see business - not hear rumors.''
   Soybeans continued to face pressure from a government report
issued last week that found larger stocks of the crop than had been
expected.
   Follow-through selling in wheat and corn came from Wednesday's
sharp losses. Little export activity and bountiful crops were
blamed for another session of significant losses.
   At the close, wheat futures were 8\ cents to 4 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.47 a bushel; corn
futures were 2} cents to } cent lower with December at $2.22 a
bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents higher with December at

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher pledged
Thursday to enforce tariffs in an existing trade agreement that
helps Americans compete with Canadian softwood lumber producers.
   ``Events in Canada suggest that the government of Canada may be
under increasing pressure to renegotiate or eliminate'' the
4-year-old memo of understanding between the two countries,
Mosbacher said.
   ``We are firmly committed ... and will take any action necessary
and appropriate to enforce the terms of the agreement,'' he said in
a letter Thursday to Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House
Small Business subcommittee on regulation, energy and business
opportunity.
   Canada agreed in 1986 to impose a 15 percent surtax on lumber
exports to the United States to help offset subsidies Canadian
producers receive from their government. Canada supplied about 28
percent of the softwood lumber consumed in the United States last
year, worth nearly $2.8 billion.
   But Northwest lawmakers are afraid the export duties will be
weakened, allowing Canadians to undercut prices for U.S. softwood
lumber and eventually costing jobs.
   Mosbacher said the 1986 agreement has become a ``political
target'' in Canada because of saw mill closures, a stronger
Canadian dollar and fear of a market downturn.
   ``It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,'' said Steve
Jenning, staff director of Wyden's subcommittee's. ``Their
political advisers are urging their people in Ontario to take
action prior to the return of Congress in January.''
   But Mosbacher said in the letter that while Canada's economic
problems have an impact on its lumber industry, they don't affect
the subsidies the agreement offsets.

   Walt Disney World and the American
Automobile Association have pulled a newspaper advertisement that
shows a young girl in a car without a seat belt.
   In the ad for ``AAA Days'' at Disney theme parks, the girl is
standing on the front seat of a convertible whizzing past the
Cinderella Castle.
   Failure to wear a seat belt in Florida can result in a $20 fine,
according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
   Disney spokesman John Dreyer said one of his company's art
directors allowed the girl to stand because the photograph was
taken in a stationary car. A fan was used to blow the family's hair
to make it look like the car was moving.
   ``It was an honest mistake,'' said Dreyer, who said the ad has
been pulled. ``We really had no intention of encouraging people to
travel without buckling up.''
   The ad was part of a campaign to attract AAA members to Disney
World.

<TEXT>
   The dollar inched higher on world currency
markets Thursday in cautious, choppy trading.
   Gold prices fell overseas but advanced in domestic dealings. On
New York's Commodity Exchange, where gold plunged $8.40 an ounce in
the previous session, the metal gained $1.50 an ounce to settle at
$379.10. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at
$378.75 an ounce, up $1.15.
   Traders said the market was thin, with most investors focusing
on currencies other than the dollar. ``A lot of people were selling
(Japanese) yen and buying (German) marks,'' said Gilbert Cisneros,
a trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
   He said many traders were confused and not willing to bet on
what direction the dollar might take.
   The financial markets continue to await signs that the Federal
Reserve has nudged interest rates lower in an effort to stimulate a
weakening U.S. economy. Lower interest rates generally are negative
for the dollar because they erode the value of dollar-denominated
securities.
   Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA, said that once the
Fed makes its move, traders will begin looking ahead for yet
another easing of interest rates, probably shortly after the new
year.
   Some dealers are looking for Friday's report on the September
trade deficit to rekindle interest in the dollar. With the U.S.
currency trading at depressed levels, most economists expect some
improvement from the $9.3 billion deficit registered in the
previous month.
   Also Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to report on the
consumer price index for October.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.30 Japanese yen from
129.05 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it fell to 129.15
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 129.69 yen, up from 129.09
yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9590 from $1.9615 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9575 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9600.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.4755 German marks, up from 1.4726;
1.2518 Swiss francs, up from 1.2470; 4.9850 French francs, up from
4.9670; 1,113.25 Italian lire, up from 1,111.00, and 1.1624
Canadian dollars, own from 1.1631.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.4765 German marks, up from 1.4715;
1.2515 Swiss francs, up from 1.2460; 4.9890 French francs, up from
4.9585; 1.6650 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6593; 1,112.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,109.00, and 1.1617 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1640.
   Gold prices fell in London to a late bid of $379.25 a troy ounce
from $384.45 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid
of $378.60 an ounce from $384.40. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
$4.43 an ounce to $379.03.
   Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.117 a troy ounce, down from $4.16 on
Wednesday. In London the metal fell to a late bid of $4.16 a troy

<HEAD>Embattled Eastern Flying Wounded After Creditors' Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines got a cash infusion that should
keep it alive for a few weeks, but the struggling carrier faces
another test next month when it tries to persuade a bankruptcy
judge to hand out more money.
   Eastern's fight for survival is made even tougher by wounds
suffered in the boisterous battle with creditors who want the
airline shut so its assets can be sold off, industry analysts said
Thursday.
   Court-appointed trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr. agreed Eastern's
prospects for recovery had been harmed by a ``reckless and
shameful'' attack from the unsecured creditors.
   They told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland that Eastern
has no chance of regaining financial strength, which has withered
relentlessly since a strike and bankruptcy filing in March 1989
threw the airline's future into doubt.
   But Shugrue said Eastern has a reasonable hope of growing
stronger through its marketing of first-class seats at coach-class
prices, despite a likely loss of overall bookings following
widespread publicity of the creditors' claims that Eastern was
dying.
   ``America loves an underdog, and we are an underdog,'' Shugrue
told a news conference Thursday. ``We are the underdog in this
indutry.''
   Shugrue persuaded the judge during a hearing Wednesday night to
keep Eastern flying for now, with an immediate withdrawal of $15
million from an escrow account that the creditors wanted to
preserve. On Thursday, Shugrue said he had the court's support,
even though Lifland would not give Eastern the entire $30 million
it had sought.
   The judge said he wants to see how well Eastern is doing early
next month before it can tap into the account for another $15
million.
   Shugrue predicted Thursday that Eastern will be able to show
enough of an improvement to get the money. But soon, he's going to
have to ask for more, with an anticipated request for $40 million
coming in late December to be followed by a request for $10 million
in early January.
   After that, Eastern thinks it can turn the corner toward
profitability, even though the creditors fear the airline is
throwing good money after bad.
   Analysts also have their doubts about Eastern's future.
   Raymond E. Neidl at Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc. said Eastern might
encounter troubles just showing the judge it is doing well enough
to get the next $15 million.
   Neidl said that when the judge gave Eastern some but not all of
the money Shugrue wanted Wednesday, he may have sent a signal that
the airline should start selling what it can before the inevitable
occurs.
   ``It could be kind of a push saying, `Maybe it's time to sell
the assets while you're a going concern,''' Neidl said. An active
business can generally expect to get a better price for assets than
a business forced to liquidate.
   Creditors said they stood by their view that Eastern cannot
become a viable, stand-alone airline at a time when fuel prices
seem out of control and the United States is displaying symptoms of
a recession.
   The unsecured creditors, who include banks, airplane companies
and labor unions, said they had not yet plotted their next move,
however.
   ``We have some ideas, but the committee will be meeting to talk
about that,'' attorney Joel B. Zweibel said Thursday. ``So at the
moment there isn't any public statement on their intentions.''
   Miami-based Eastern, meanwhile, was assuring its 18,000 workers
they are still in business while checking with travel agents to see
how much damage the airline had incurred.
   ``One of the problems we have to address is we did lose a
significant amount of business,'' said Eastern spokesman Jim
Ashlock. ``We have to regain now that public confidence. It's very
difficult to get back cancellations because that usually means
they've booked somewhere else.''
   Some travel agents say they are advising people against booking
flights on Eastern. Others are suggesting that travelers use their
credit cards for tickets, so if Eastern goes under the customers
can refuse to pay the credit card company.
   E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Eastern pilots union, said the
fatal damage has been done because of the likelihood travel agents
will book away from Eastern.
   ``I really and truly think that this whole process has put the
final nail in the coffin,'' Breen said.

   Lawyers representing most of the defendants in
criminal proceedings against Eastern Airlines and several of its
managers withdrew from the case Thursday because their clients
don't have money to pay legal bills.
   The lawyers had entered the case believing the air carrier would
stand behind its employees and pay the legal fees.
   However, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is
overseeing the finances of the embattled airline, last week refused
to approve the payments.
   Eastern - which is struggling to regain the confidence of the
flying public, especially business travelers - is currently losing
about $1 million a day.
   An Eastern spokesman said the carrier would try to help the
employees, possibly using voluntary contributions.
   ``Whatever we might be able to do at the company to assist them,
we're going to explore and pursue,'' said James R. Ashlock, an
Eastern spokesman in Miami.
   ``There's been already a movement to obtain from the 18,000
Eastern employees voluntary funds to underwrite the defense for
these people. The employees here do feel an affiliation, and in
many respects, what's happened to them is unfair,'' he said.
   At a hearing Thursday, U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of
Brooklyn granted the lawyers' request to be removed from the case.
The defendants, who said they would seek court-appointed counsel,
were directed to return to court on Nov. 26 with their new lawyers.
   The lawyers were dismissed hours after Lifland granted Eastern
more time and money to show it could recover at least some of its
past strength. The airline's unsecured creditors had asked the
bankruptcy judge to shut down Eastern and liquidate it.
   Eastern, once one of the nation's top airlines, was struggling
to remain solvent when the airline and nine of its managers were
indicted in August on criminal charges that they falsified
maintenance and safety records to keep their jetliners in the air
and carrying passengers.
   The 60-count indictment, unprecedented in the airline industry,
charged a pattern of pressure and intimidation from the airline's
headquarters in Miami to ``keep the aircraft in flight at all
costs.''
   Two Eastern foremen at Kennedy airport have pleaded guilty to
ignoring needed aircraft repairs and then falsifying records to
make it appear the work had been done.
   The foremen, who are cooperating with prosecutors, said the
scheme was orchestrated by executives at the airline who coerced
them into altering the documents.
   The highest ranking executive charged was Edward Upton, 40, a
former vice president. Because of an earlier agreement, Eastern
will pay his legal fees and his attorney, Stephen E. Kaufman, will
remain as his lawyer.
   The law firm retained by Eastern will also continue in the case.
   One of the former defense lawyers, Edward J. Little, said the
trial is expected to last up to four months with legal fees for
each of the defendants totalling $300,000 or more. Little
represented Jacques Jean, a former maintenance supervisor accused
of falsifying aircraft records.
   The start of the trial, originally scheduled for Jan. 28, 1991,
will likely be postponed.

   General Motors Corp. will begin exporting a small
number of Chevrolet, Pontiac and Cadillac cars to Yugoslavia
beginning early next year, the automaker said Thursday.
   The initial order is for 450 1991 GM Chevrolet Corsica, Cadillac
Sedan DeVille and Pontiac Grand Prix and Bonneville cars. The order
was to be signed Friday in a ceremony at GM headquarters in
Detroit.
   GM also has agreements to establish vehicle and component
assembly operations in other Eastern European countries, including
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and the former East
Germany.
   The Yugoslavian-bound cars will go to YK, a vehicle distributor
located in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia.
   ``Our target is to sell 1,000 vehicles next year from the
Sarajevo dealership,'' YK President Sead Dizdarevic said in a news
release.
   Within a year, he said he hopes to expand his GM dealership
network from four to 17 outlets.
   YK estimated that of the 300,000 new vehicles sold in Yugoslavia
last year, about 25 percent were imported.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell slightly in the week ended Nov. 5, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,315.7 billion from a revised $3,315.8 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,084.2 billion from a revised $4,085.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $822.6 billion from a revised $820.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.9 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,316.3 billion, a 4.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,090.2 billion, up 1.6 percent, while M1
rose 5.7 percent to an average of $819.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $263 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$253 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 14, up from $317.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Reports Record Quarterly Earnings at Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. on Thursday said
higher sales and a worldwide reorganization boosted first-quarter
earnings 28 percent for the best quarter in the company's history.
   For the three months ended Oct. 28, net earnings climbed to
$105.1 million, or 82 cents a share, on sales of $1.6 billion. In
the first quarter last year, earnings were $83 million, or 64 cents
a share, on revenues of $1.5 billion.
   ``We are pleased with the progress we have made during this
first quarter and remain confident about the rest of the year,''
Campbell chief executive officer David W. Johnson said at a
shareholders' meeting.
   Johnson said Campbell's, which has been struggling to improve
its sluggish performance in the industry, has turned the corner to
profitability. He said the 28 percent increase was the best
quarterly performance in the company's 121-year history.
   ``The quarter was better than expected,'' said John M. McMillin,
a food industry analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York. ``They certainly got their fiscal year off to a good
start.''
   In fiscal 1990, Campbell's profits dropped sharply as the
company continued a two-year restructuring and corporate makeover.
Earnings for the year were $4.4 million or 3 cents per share,
compared with a profit of $13 million or 10 cents per share in
1989.
   The 90-minute shareholder meeting was the first for Johnson, who
was brought in last January as the first outsider to hold the CEO
position in the company's history. Johnson, who had run Gerber
Products Co., was known for turning around beleaguered companies.
   Johnson announced that the board of directors had approved an
increase in quarterly dividends, from 25 cents to 29 cents per
share, payable Jan. 31, 1991.
   The higher earnings were seen as a first step toward pacifying
disgruntled members of the founding Dorrance family, who own a
major stake in Campbell's and have urged selling off the company.
The rift in the Dorrance family and Campbell's depressed stock
price had made the company the target of frequent takeover rumors.
   Campbell North America, the company's largest division, reported
a 30 percent increase in operating earnings to $177.7 million,
compared with $137.2 million the year before.
   Strong volume gains in two new condensed soups - cream of
broccoli and the Teddy Bear line - boosted sales for the period to
$1.1 billion from $1.09 billion last year.
   Operating earnings in Campbell's biscuit and bakery division
were up 16 percent to $25.7 million from $22.1 million the year
before, boosted by a strong performance from Pepperidge Farm. Sales
increased 9 percent to $212 million from $195 million in 1989.
   Favorable exchange rates boosted sales for Campbell
International by 18 percent to $307 million from $261 million last
year. Operating earnings for the quarter were $4.1 million,
compared with $2.7 million last year.
   Johnson said Campbell plans to boost its earnings per share by
20 percent annually over the next few years. He said the company
also plans to achieve at least a 20 percent return on equity and a
20 percent cash return on assets.

<HEAD>Wheat Sharply Down; Soybeans Stage Moderate Comeback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat prices fell sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, plunging to near contract lows on mild weather conditions
and a dearth of export business.
   On other commodities markets, soybeans rose; corn fell; gold and
platinum ended slightly higher; silver slipped; and meat and
livestock futures were mixed.
   Wheat prices settled 7} cents to 4 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.47{ a bushel.
   ``Nothing. That's what traders are seeing in the way of export
business in the grains,'' said Mickey Luth, an analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Recent weather forecasts predicting above-normal temperatures in
the regions where winter wheat is grown also pressured futures
prices, Luth said.
   Soybean prices on the Board of Trade staged a moderate comeback
from previous session lows as speculation grew that a U.S.-European
food aid package to the Soviet Union would come out of President
Bush's upcoming trip to Europe.
   Soybeans futures were boosted later in the day after rumors
began circulating that the United States was preparing to offer
subsidized soybean meal to Pakistan, said Dan Cekander, an analyst
with Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   But the gains probably will be only short-term, Cekander said.
   ``We've had so many rumors of aid, and they never pan out,'' he
said. ``I expect to see further liquidation because the market
wants to see business - not hear rumors.''
   Soybeans continued to face pressure from a government report
issued last week that found larger stocks of the crop than had been
expected. Corn suffered from a good harvest and little export
activity.
   Corn futures settled 2} cents to 1\ cents lower with December at
$2.22 a bushel; oats settled 1} cents to 2} cents higher with
December at $1.09} a bushel; soybeans settled { cent to 4\ cents
higher with November at $5.58{ a bushel.
   Gold and platinum ended slightly higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange on support from Japanese buying of platinum and an early
rally in crude oil prices.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.50 higher with December at $380.00 a
troy ounce. Silver settled 7.1 cents to 5.7 cents lower with
December at $4.117 an ounce. Platinum settled $1.30 to $1.80 higher
with January at $415.70.
   Energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange slid as
traders continued to bet on peace in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude settled 10 cents lower to 80 cents higher with
December at $31.12 a barrel; heating oil settled .01 cent to 1.12
cents higher with December at 86.67 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline settled .23 cent lower to .60 cent higher with December at
80.16 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, pressured by commission-house selling and profit-taking.
   Hog futures suffered from another round of profit-taking after
generally enjoying high prices because of lower-than-expected
near-term stocks.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .08 cent higher with
December at 78.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .05 cent lower
to .12 cent higher with November at 88.67 cents a pound; hogs were
.55 cent lower to .22 cent higher with December at 53.35 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 2.00 cents to 1.92 cent lower with
February at 70.12 cents a pound.

   More than 50 New York Telephone employees were
fired, resigned or face pay cuts for accepting gifts and gratuities
from vendors, the company announced Thursday.
   The employees were from the company's Buildings Department,
which is responsible for construction, repairs, cleaning and
routine maintenance of New York Telephone property.
   The company said the 28 employees who either resigned or were
fired accepted nearly $50,000 in cash, gifts and gratuities since
1985.
   Another 28 employees face fines or other disciplinary action for
accepting gifts such as liquor or gift certificates during the
holiday season since 1985.
   The tips violated New York Telephone's code of ethics, said
spokesman Tom Pica. Cases involving allegations of criminal
activities have been turned over to the Manhattan district
attorney's office.
   Another Buildings Department employee, John Nobile, was indicted
June 15 for grand larceny, bribe-taking and other charges.
   A trial date has not yet been set, said district attorney's
office spokesman Gerald McKelvey.

   The stock market suffered a moderate setback
Thursday, giving up some of the gains recorded in its rally since
mid-October.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had built up a
net gain of 71.04 points in the week's first three sessions,
dropped 14.60 to 2,545.05.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
591 up, 918 down and 470 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.37 million
shares, against 179.31 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 182.17 million shares.
   Oil prices fluctuated through a mixed session, and interest
rates rose in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government
bonds fell slightly, lifting their yields to the 8.52 percent-8.53
percent range.
   Analysts said that provided stock traders with enough incentive
to cash in some of their recent gains.
   The recovery in stock prices has been based to a considerable
degree on expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon take new
steps to relax its credit policy.
   Some observers believe that any likely Fed action has been
largely ``discounted,'' or taken into account in advance, by the
market's rise of late.
   A primary item on the market agenda for Friday is the Labor
Department's monthly report on the consumer price index. If advance
estimates are correct, the October index will show an increase of
perhaps 0.6 percent or 0.7 percent, down from 0.8 percent in both
August and September.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down | at
39\; International Business Machines, down ~ at 112|; General
Electric, down \ at 55, and Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at 48{.
   Bank stocks bogged down as well. J.P. Morgan fell } to 40};
Chemical Banking &rsqb; to 12; Chase Manhattan &rsqb; to 10}; NCNB 1&lsqb; to 23\,

   Monarch Capital tumbled 3 to 2{, for a 54.5 percent percentage
drop. The insurance holding company reported a $67.79 million loss
for the third quarter, including discontinued operations, and
suspended the dividend on its preferred stock.
   MCA rose 2&rsqb; to 67~ pending talks scheduled for next week toward
its planned acquisition by Matsushita Electrical.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26 billion, or 0.87
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.56 to 173.12.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.99 to 371.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.38 at 317.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. announced Thursday that Chairman
Colman M. Mockler Jr. and two other senior executives would retire,
paving the way for a succession in leadership at the shaving
products company.
   Mockler, 60, who has also been chief executive officer since
1975, will leave at the end of 1991.
   Derwyn F. Phillips, 60, a vice chairman, and John W. Symons, 60,
executive vice president overseeing the company's North Atlantic
division, will retire from their positions by the end of 1990.
   No replacements to Mockler or Phillips were named. Robert J.
Murray, 49, who has been chairman at Braun AG, a Gillette
subsidiary, will replace Symons on Jan. 1.
   The company said Alfred M. Zeien, 60, a vice chairman, was
elected president and chief operating officer effective Jan. 1.
   Analysts said Gillette had been sending signals that Zeien
eventually would take a leading role in the company, but they
doubted he would succeed Mockler due to his age.
   The company said in a statement the moves were ``designed to
begin the process of an orderly succession in management.''
   Mockler, who has been chairman since 1976, said he felt now was
an appropriate time to announce his retirement because he is
pleased with Gillette's products and organization.
   ``The company is in a very good position,'' he said.
   Some analysts said they were not surprised by the announcement,
noting the ages of the retirees. But Diana Temple, an analyst at
Salomon Brothers, was surprised by the departure of Symons, saying
he was a main force behind Gillette's new Sensor razor, introduced
earlier this year.
   Mockler received praise for giving Gillette stability. He helped
guide the company through two takeover battles in the 1980s and
oversaw a major restructuring.
   ``He was probably running the company through its most
tumultuous time,'' said Jack Salzman, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs
&amp; Co.
   Under the realignment announced Thursday, the company's four
major operating units - Gillette North Atlantic, Stationery
Products-North Atlantic, Gillette International and Diversified
Operations - will report to Zeien.
   Mockler said the biggest challenge for the company is take
advantage of new opportunities and markets around the world.

   Assets of the nation's 523 money market mutual
funds fell $1.23 billion in the latest week to $417.1 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$2.94 billion increase in fund assets the previous week to an
all-time high of $418.33 billion,the Washington-based mutual trade
fund group said.
   It said that in the latest week, assets of 259 general purpose

broker-dealer funds fell $356.7n million to $164.97 billion; and
assets of 160 institutional funds fell $724.4 million to $103.49
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.34 percent from 7.38 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield slipped to 7.40 percent from 7.42
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
49 days, the same as the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.01 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.02 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.08 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.58
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.60
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.71 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.73 percent; 7.80 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.84

<HEAD>Carrageenan Called Revolutionary for Meat Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health experts, restaurant giants and the meat
industry are all watching a McDonald's Corp. consumer test of a
super-lean beef developed by replacing fat with an algae product
called carrageenan.
   Analysts and industry insiders say if it's successful, the new
product could reshape a beef industry often criticized by health
experts for its fatty output.
   ``If it's really palatable, it's revolutionary,'' said Phil
Sokolof, a millionaire industrialist from Omaha who ran full-page
advertisements in several major newspapers accusing fast-food
chains of selling too many high-fat foods.
   ``We're talking about a complete change in American diet,'' he
said.
   Last year for the first time ever, more chicken than beef was
consumed in the United States. A worried beef industry has sought
for nearly half a decade to develop leaner beef for
health-conscious consumers.
   The answer may have come with carrageenan, a gum-like substance
used to bind ingredients together much as fat would, said Mary
Adolf, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based Beef Industry Council of
the Meat Board.
   ``I think what's interesting about this product is the lean
patty itself has a taste and a texture similar to a product that
has significantly more fat,'' Ms. Adolf said. ``This product has a
lot of potential.''
   Carrageenan is widely used in pharmaceuticals and ice cream
products, but now is expanding into other areas, including possible
use in all processed meats to reduce fat, said Alan Mathis, a
spokesman for National Food Processors in Washington, D.C.
   But national marketing of the beef or any other
carrageenan-based product probably is a long way off, said Charles
Levitt, a senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   Super-lean beef is ``certainly not going to hurt beef demand
any,'' Levitt said. ``It's not going to change overnight,
obviously, and will take time to filter its way into the market,
but it's a positive.''
   The food service industry is watching to see if the public will
sink its teeth into the product.
   McDonald's said Wednesday it is test-marketing in restaurants in
the Harrisburg, Pa. area a low-fat hamburger that has carregeenan
as an ingredient.
   The quarter-pound burger, called Lean Deluxe, and its condiments
have 10 grams, or 2{ teaspoons of fat. McDonald's Quarter Pounder,
in contrast, has 20 grams of fat.
   Dieticians recommend that a person eat no more than 67 grams of
fat a day.
   Nutritionists, hesitant to praise the low-fat beef outright,
expressed optimism.
   ``The impact on a nation that loves its fatty hamburgers could
be extremely dramatic,'' said Bonnie Liebman, nutrition director at
the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C.
   The Agriculture Department also is considering buying the
low-fat beef for the national school lunch program, said Dale
Huffman, an Auburn University meat biochemist who helped develop
the meat.
   ``Obviously, if the USDA accepts the leaner meat, it will be a
boost. And it would help immeasurably if kids like it, since the
majority of hamburger eaters are younger people,'' Huffman said.
   His research, and that at two other universities, was funded by
the Meat Board, which since 1986 has collected $1 per head of
cattle from ranchers to find ways to produce leaner beef.

   Crude oil prices finished slightly lower
Thursday after see-sawing in brisk trading in the absence of
significant news from the Persian Gulf.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December-delivery
contract for benchmark light sweet crude oil swung in a wide range,
rising as much as 69 cents a barrel and falling as much as $1.01
before rallying to close at $31.12, down 4 cents from a day
earlier. Contracts for later months mostly rose.
   The market's behavior reflected what traders called an
underlying tendency to weaken unless there's a profound increase in
Persian Gulf tensions that could provoke a long-awaited fight
between the United States and Iraq.
   The market tumbled nearly $2 a barrel Wednesday as traders
focused on the fundamentals of supply and demand, which show that
petroleum stockpiles are plentiful. Oil now is nearly $10 lower
than the panic-driven highs reached during the tense stages of the
3-month-old Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   ``Basically, what happened today is just a continuation of what
we've been seeing,'' said James Fiedler, a broker and vice
president at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc., a New York
trading concern. ``Ample supply, falling demand and if there is a
war it won't be soon.''
   Traders said the market's rebound late in the day was
accelerated by short-covering, in which traders who had sold
borrowed oil contracts on the mistaken hunch they would fall in
price scrambled to buy them back.
   Some traders said the market's late rally may have been a
reaction to a rumor that the United States had formulated a
specific attack date to retake Kuwait from Iraq. But others said
that rumor was stale speculation and had no influence on prices.
   Among refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange,
wholesale home-heating oil for December delivery rose .3 cent to
86.67 cents a gallon. Contracts for more distant months also closed
higher.
   Wholesale gasoline for December delivery fell 2.3 cents a gallon
to 80.16 cents, while more distant months were mostly higher.
Natural gas for December delivery fell .28 cent per 1,000 cubic
feet to $2.40. More distant months were mostly lower.

   Using computers, sophisticated imaging
equipment and genetic mapping, university scientists are trying to
discover ``supercows'' in the laboratory.
   ``If you look at genetics, we've made so much more progress in
the last 15 years than we made in the last 100,'' said Mike Brown
of the National Milk Producers Federation.
   ``There's certainly more interest in it because it's getting a
little tougher to make a living in dairy,'' he said.
   Economics is a driving force in the science of breeding a better
bovine, experts said.
   ``The quest for the supercow has some real important management
implications,'' said William Graves, state dairy specialist at the
University of Massachusetts. ``Farmers are going to have to look
for alternate ways to try and stay in business and still produce
what they produce at less cost.''
   At the University of Massachusetts, professors Abel Ponce de
Leon and James Robl are mapping part of the cow's genetic package,
with the help of a three-year, $210,000 grant from the USDA. The
project also is supported by the Eastern Artificial Insemination
Cooperative.
   Using existing studies that showed a variation in DNA is related
to milk production, the researchers plan to isolate a particular
chromosome, called bovine chromosome 23.
   ``We are going to concentrate on one chromosome where there is a
high likelihood that there will be genes that participate in the
control of milk production,'' Ponce de Leon said.
   ``What we're doing is we're using a direct approach to be able
to select animals on their DNA rather than on production traits or
physical characteristics,'' said Robl.
   The advantages of using molecular biology to track down good
milkers is that it takes the trial-and-error out of the equation,
said Caird E. Rexroad, a research physiologist with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   ``Before we had to depend on the animal's milk production and
evaluating the production of the daughters of specific bulls,''
Rexroad said.
   Other scientific advances in dairy production include the
process of selling frozen embryos from high-yield cows to be
implanted in surrogates.
   Genetic research is going on at various laboratories across the
country, said Rexroad, who said that Ponce de Leon and Robl are the
only team he knows of working to isolate a specific chromosome.
   ``Probably in the future we will have a few less cows on the
farms than we do now. These techniques will make it possible for
the most efficient farmers to survive,'' said Rexroad.

   The Bush administration is considering cuts in
popular government benefit programs such as Social Security and
Medicare as part of the budget it will submit to Congress in
February, an administration official said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke on the condition his name not be used,
said the cuts being considered would reduce benefits for affluent
recipients with the savings used to provide tax cuts to the poor
and middle class.
   Such an action ``is clearly being contemplated very seriously,''
said the official, who also stressed that all planning for the new
budget was in a very preliminary stage with final decisions a long
way from being made.
   Meanwhile, President Bush received a gloomy assessment of
economic prospects from a group of business executives on Thursday.
They told the president they believed the country had probably
entered a recession.
   Commenting later, Bush stopped short of saying the country was
already in a downturn.
   ``I'm not an economist but most seem to feel that if we have a
recession that meets these technical terms, that it will not be
deep and that we'll come out of it relatively soon - six months at
most,'' Bush said in an interview on the Cable News Network.
   In the past, the administration and Congress have both shied
away from proposing cuts in Social Security and Medicare because of
the firestorm of protests such changes could raise.
   The benefit cuts are receiving a second look, the official said,
because the administration believes that the new deficit-reduction
agreement passed by Congress conferred added authority.
   In the past, the administration shied away from proposing tax
cuts and benefit reductions for fear that Congress would pass the
tax cuts and leave the benefit levels unchanged.
   However, the deficit-reduction law passed last month includes a
``pay-as-you-go'' mechanism that will trigger automatic benefit
cuts unless Congress reduces benefits in line with any tax
reductions approved by lawmakers.
   The possibility of the benefit cuts was first disclosed in
Thursday's Wall Street Journal.
   In his meeting with executives, Bush received a generally gloomy
report on the prospects for the economy with the general consensus
of the group being that the country was probably in a recession.
   John G. Medlin Jr., president and chief executive officer of
First Wachovia Corp., a leading bank holding company, told
reporters afterward that the general consensus among the executives
was that the country probably has entered its first recession in
eight years.
   ``I think there was probably a view that we may have slipped
into a recession,'' said Medlin, whose bank is headquartered in
Winston-Salem, N.C. ``There was not much argument that we were
somewhere in that area between a little growth and a little
decline.''
   Medlin said the executives, representing banks and industrial
firms, noted in particular the problems besetting the construction
and real estate industries, which have been hard hit by
overbuilding and slumping prices.
   Besides Bush, administration officials participating in
Thursday's meeting were Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget
Director Richard Darman and John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff.
   A White House official, who spoke on the condition he not be
named, said the president was trying to decide what steps to take
to soften the impact of the current slowdown.
   Last week, Bush and Michael Boskin, his chief economic adviser,
came close to saying the country is in a recession.
   Bush spoke of ``tough times'' and said he wanted to insure that
``to the degree a president can do something to soften the blow or
to stimulate economic growth, that he tries to do it.''
   The White House official said Thursday's meeting followed a
session Bush had Wednesday with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan and other top banking regulators.
   At that meeting, according to another administration source who
also spoke on the condition of anonymity, Sununu and Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher talked about a slowdown in bank lending,
which they blamed on regulatory overkill in the wake of the savings
and loan crisis.
   Mosbacher has complained for months about a ``credit crunch''
choking off the flow of credit needed to keep the economy healthy.
   Greenspan and other banking regulators, however, have argued
that the slowdown in lending reflects current weak loan demand
rather than bank examiners being over zealous.
   Administration officials have said that the president was
reviewing various proposals to stimulate economic growth and would
likely submit a set of recommendations as part of the 1991 budget,
which he will send to Congress in early February.
   Medlin said neither the president nor any of the other
administration officials gave any hint of what pro-growth
initiatives they may propose.
   ``The president just listened. He didn't give us his views,''
Medlin said. ``He was very sincerely looking for views out in the
real world.''
   The Wednesday and Thursday meetings were an outgrowth of a
meeting Bush had over the weekend at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md., with Brady, Boskin, Darman and Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   Boskin last week said that ``at best'' the economy was in a
lull, which he predicted would last through the first half of 1991.
He said that a new administration economic forecast, due to be
completed soon, envisioned the possibility of the economy
``slipping into negative territory'' by year's end.
   Boskin said it was possible that the economic contraction could
last into early 1991. The traditional definition of a recession is
two consecutive quarters in which the gross national product, the
total output of goods and services, declines.
   The White House refused to release a list of those meeting with
Bush, saying the sessions were private.
   ``It's an opportunity for the president to hear them (the
business leaders.) These are listening sessions,'' the White House
official said.

<TEXT>
   Advertising rates will rise for Newsweek and
U.S. News and World Report in 1991, the weekly news magazines
announced Thursday.
   The increases, which follow a similar move at rival Time, were
blamed on rising costs for postage and news coverage.
   In addition, U.S. News plans to increase its cover price from
$1.95 to $2.50 effective with the Jan. 7 issue, matching the cover
price of the other two major weeklies.
   The advertising rate increases at Newsweek, with circulation of
3.1 million readers, will boost four-color ad rates by 7 percent
and black-and-white by 10 percent. Effective with the Jan. 7 issue,
the rate for a four-color page will be $108,050, and $69,455 for a
black-and-white page.
   Newsweek publisher Peter Eldredge said advertising linage was
off about 5 percent this year, while costs for postage and news
coverage, including reporting from the Persian Gulf, have increased
significantly.
   U.S. News, with circulation of 2.3 million, said it would raise
ad rates 7.9 percent across the board, bringing the four-color page
rate to $72,400 and black-and-white to $48,500.
   U.S. News president and chief executive officer Fred Drasner
said the rate changes followed a year of growth in circulation,
revenue and newsstand sales. Carol Welsh, a spokeswoman, said ad
pages were off slightly for the year.
   Officials at Newsweek and U.S. News said postage increases would
exceed 20 percent in 1991. Both said they were exploring
alternative delivery methods.
   Time Warner announced on Nov. 5 that it planned to increase its
national four-color rate by 6.5 percent to $128,000 effective Jan.
1. The rate was based on a circulation of 4 million readers. It
said other ad rates would increase by varying amounts depending on
the edition and type of ad.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An industry committee told the Food and Drug
Administration on Thursday that the agency needs more regulatory
power over generic drugs, including the ability to ban from the new
drug business people who violate its regulations.
   The panel established by the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry
Association also said the agency should extend some regulations
that apply to newly branded drugs to generic drugs, and generic
manufacturers' trade associations should establish a code of ethics
for members.
   The Blue Ribbon Committee on Generic Medicines was established
in the wake of disclosures that some generic companies had faked
test results and accusations that some company executives had
bribed FDA employees.
   A new drug, if patented, may not be manufactured by anyone
except the holder of the patent, or a company licensed by a patent
holder. When the patent expires, however, anyone may make the drug
as a generic, and those drugs are generally cheaper than the
original.
   Approval for patented drugs is a long and difficult process that
takes years and requires the manufacturer to show that the drug is
both safe and effective.
   Approval for generic drugs is much simpler. The manufacturer
generally has to show only that the drug reaches approximately the
same concentration in the bloodstream that the original does.
   In those equivalence tests, some companies did not actually test
their own drug, but tested the branded original against itself - a
form of cheating practically guaranteed to show what the industry
calls ``bioequivalence.''
   ``The committee believes generic medicines make a major
contribution to consumers,'' the panel of five physicians and two
lawyers said in a statement summarizing its recommendations.
   ``The committee recognizes that its recommendations may increase
some companies' costs, but nonetheless believes that the increased
benefit to the public associated with a reliable supply of generic
drugs justifies the additional expense.''
   The summary gave no examples of what the increased costs might
amount to.
   Congress, the committee said, should:
   -Permit the agency to debar individuals who commit certain
offenses from participating in the development, application for
approval, manufacture or sale of products regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration.
   -Increase criminal penalties and require a return of profits
resulting from criminal misconduct.
   -Require corporations whose employees are convicted of
misconduct in the approval process to prove that their products are
still safe and effective.
   -Give the FDA additional subpoena powers.
   The committee said FDA should:
   -Require public disclosure of any financial arrangements outside
of fee-for-service contracts between applicants for approval of
generic drugs and testing laboratories.
   -Impose the same standards of responsibility for generic
applicants that currently pertain to applicants sponsoring
experimental drugs.
   -Try to identify and resolve controversial issues before
beginning review of new generic drugs.
   -Issue additional guidance to the industry on how to demonstrate
bioequivalence.

   Wall Street's struggling securities firms face
weak profits and more consolidation in the 1990s as they regroup in
an increasingly competitive world market, Moody's Investors Service
said Thursday.
   In its annual report on the securities industry, Moody's said
reversing the mammoth buildup in the heyday of big-fee mergers and
active stock markets in the 1980s will be the focus of the current
decade.
   ``This overcapacity will take years to reduce, and will put
fundamental downward pressure on securities firms' returns,'' said
the report, written by Moody's vice president John Kriz.
   The securities industry has struggled since the October 1987
stock market crash. More than 45,000 jobs have been erased and the
key business lines of investment banking, leveraged buyouts, and
mergers and acquisitions have nosedived.
   ``The outlook now is that those three areas will be much, much
smaller and in some cases nonexistent,'' said Moody's vice
president Christopher Mahoney, who helped prepare the report.
   ``The Street was subsidizing a lot of growth domestically and
internationally from lucrative businesses that are drying up or
diminishing,'' he said.
   Moody's predicted further consolidation leading to domination by
firms created through acquisition by wealthy companies.
``Ultimately there may be few, if any, large independent Wall
Street securities firms,'' the report said.
   The power of diversified, strong owners has been a theme of the
industry's woes this year, in which several major securities firms
have been bailed out of severe financial difficulty by
deep-pocketed parents.
   Most recently, CS First Boston Inc. this week received a $300
million equity infusion from its Swiss parent, CS Holding, which
took majority control of the investment banking firm. CS First
Boston's main U.S. subsidiary is First Boston Corp.
   Mahoney said a problem with the trend is that the survival of
the fittest is thrown on its head. Wall Street's failed firms used
to be acquired by the successful ones.
   ``One impediment to that now is that a lot of weak firms are
owned by strong parents, so they don't die a natural death,''
Mahoney said. ``They're not absorbed by strong firms; they're
maintained as independent entities.''
   The Moody's report said intense competition, continued
overcapacity and the decline in major business segments mean weak
prospects for profitability on Wall Street through the end of the
century.
   ``Additional risks are the temptation for managements to ease
profit pressure by taking greater risks, and the likelihood of more
aggressive involvement in U.S. and overseas securities markets by
powerful foreign securities firms and banks,'' Moody's said.
   The report also cited a recent erosion of the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall Act that prevented commercial banks from entering
the securities industry.
   It said several U.S. bank-holding companies, including J.P.
Morgan, Citicorp and Bankers Trust, ``are eager to expand further
into the securities business, and they pose important competitive
threats to U.S. securities firms.''
   A similar trend is occurring in Japan, Moody's said, increasing
the challenge to U.S. firms' core businesses and markets.
   Firms across the board face cost-cutting pressures, Moody's
said. Likely targets for reductions are reducing the ballooned
compensation of the 1980s, eliminating whole businesses and exiting
from unprofitable foreign markets.
   ``The 1980s goal of becoming a global player in a broad range of
products is fading for many firms,'' Moody's said. ``Managements
are refocusing on core business in which they can build sustainable
competitive advantages.''
   Mahoney said: ``The Street lost a lot of money in London and
Tokyo.''

   Lawyers for investors and companies that bought
junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed claims Thursday
for well over $10 billion alleging rampant lawbreaking by the
collapsed Wall Street firm.
   The claims in U.S. Bankruptcy Court are in addition to $6.8
billion sought by two federal thrift bailout agencies and by far
exceed the amount Drexel can dole out in its Chapter 11
reorganization.
   Attorneys were still calculating the total, but said litigation
claims against Drexel would exceed $20 billion.
   One New York law firm alone filed 11 cases seeking $9.28 billion
on behalf of shareholders and companies that assert they were
defrauded by Drexel, the once high-flying investment firm that
sought bankruptcy court refuge in February.
   Thursday was the filing deadline for claims against Drexel.
After a lengthy hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Conrad denied
a government request for another 90 days to examine the junk bond
holdings of more savings and loans.
   More than 100 civil lawsuits have been filed against Drexel.
Lawyers for the firm, plaintiffs and the government are negotiating
to estimate how much Drexel will set aside to pay all the
litigation claims.
   Drexel would use that figure in devising a reorganization plan,
and claimants could receive a fixed percentage based on the amount
of their claims. A negotiated estimate would be presented to U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack for approval.
   ``In bankruptcy size frequently prevails over quality,'' said
David Berger, a Philadelphia lawyer who is heading a mass of cases
against Drexel, its convicted junk bond financier Michael Milken
and others.
   The estimate is not expected to come close to meeting the
claims. Drexel has only about $3 billion in assets, plus various
investments, and a long list of creditors who might take
preference. But the enormous claims could carry negotiating
leverage and potentially dilute the pot for others.
   ``The creditors who actually loaned money and bought ... bonds
in what was then a very solvent company - it seems very unfair to
them,'' said Steven Felderstein, lawyer for California's Public
Employees Retirement System, a large Drexel creditor.
   ``Everybody sees Drexel as a place where there's a lot of money,
and everybody wants their oar in the water,'' he said.
   Most claims are related to Drexel's 1989 guilty plea to six
felony counts involving illegal trading. The thrift claims involve
allegations that Drexel ran a corrupt junk bond network that helped
push dozens of savings and loans to collapse.
   All the damages sought have been tripled to reflect alleged
racketeering violations.
   In a 60-page bankruptcy court filing, the federal thrift bailout
agencies claimed Drexel preached a ``gospel of greed'' that
defrauded savings and loans by peddling inappropriate and risky
securities from 1982.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Resolution Trust Corp.
alleged that Drexel made billions of dollars by inducing S&amp;Ls to
use their federally insured deposits to buy junk bonds.
   ``The exposure of Drexel's and Milken's criminality destroyed
the illusions surrounding junk bonds that Drexel and Milken had
sought to create,'' the filing said.
   The agencies charged Drexel manipulated junk bond prices,
arranged secret securities ``parking'' deals, ran sham
transactions, bribed favored customers and controlled a network of
S&amp;L customers to sustain a house-of-cards market.
   The filing presents the most vivid picture yet of allegations of
impropriety in Drexel's dominance of the $200 billion market for
the securities, which compensated for the risk of default by
offering high yields.
   It lists 41 failed thrifts with junk bond losses totaling more
than $330 million and seeks more than $1.25 million more in damages
for the lost value of current holdings. Another 18 failed thrifts
have separate non-junk bond claims. Institutions from 18 states and
the District of Columbia are included.
   The alleged damages are tripled under federal antitrust and
racketeering laws, for a total of $6 billion. The agencies seek
$800 million for alleged illegal activity unrelated to junk bonds.
   A separate claim of more than $4.5 billion was filed on behalf
of Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif.,
a major Drexel customer, which has not been taken over by the
government.
   Drexel said it was targeted as a convenient scapegoat for the
S&amp;L crisis by the federal agencies. Other creditors also said the
blame was misplaced and that the government claims likely would
face challenges in court.
   ``The FDIC monitored the operations of all these thrifts while
they were in business and did not take any steps to stop it while
the actual conduct was going on,'' said Barry Dichter, attorney for
one of Drexel's largest creditors.

   Jurors on Thursday ordered Lockheed Corp. to
pay $45.3 million in damages to three former employees who claimed
they were wrongfully fired for questioning the safety of the giant
C-5B military cargo plane.
   Lockheed said it will appeal.
   ``We believe the punitive damages are an injustice and come as a
result of appealing to the passions and prejudice of the jury,''
said Lockheed attorney Gordon Krischer. ``The evidence doesn't
warrant this verdict.''
   The plaintiffs asserted that four C-5Bs built with defective
mainframes continue to fly and are currently transporting troops to
Saudi Arabia, said Herbert Hafif, lawyer for two of the
whistleblowers.
   ``Our next move is to ask the Congress to investigate this,''
Hafif said, asserting that evidence in the trial proved the planes
are seriously flawed.
   The Superior Court jury announced the award after six days of
deliberations and a six-week trial.
   ``The verdict speaks for itself,'' Hafif said. ``It is the first
opportunity that regular citizens have had to speak to the faulty
inspections, violations, specifications and other transgressions
that permeate this industry and consume so much of the taxpayers'
dollars.''
   Clyde W. Jones Jr., 62, now of Tennessee; Terrence F. Schielke,
40, of Lancaster and Thomas E. Benecke, 48, of Thousand Oaks said
in their lawsuit they were dismissed in 1985 after they wrote
letters to Lockheed's second highest-ranking official demanding
that the C-5B be grounded until tests could be made.
   The three said they were concerned about deficiencies in the
mainframe of the cargo plane.
   Krischer claimed that Jones had already elected to retire before
Lockheed officials learned of the trio's concerns. Schielke and
Benecke were dismissed for circumventing company policies and audit
procedures, he said.
   Schielke, an auditing supervisor on the project, said he
repeatedly tried to warn the company that flawed parts were being
used.
   ``The frames were cracked, warped, twisted,'' he said Thursday.
``And instead of scrapping them they went ahead and used them
because it would have put them so far behind schedule to scrap them
that the Defense Department would not have bought the planes.''
   Each plaintiff was awarded $15 million in punitive damages.
Awards for compensatory damages and emotional distress totaled
$202,065 for Benecke, $91,660 for Jones and $82,789 for Schielke.
   ``The amount of punitive damages is grossly disproportionate to
the actual damages found by the jury and is insupportable factually
and legally,'' said the Lockheed vice president's statement.
   Eric Julber, who represented Benecke, said the jury award sends
``a message that you shouldn't fire people for raising safety
concerns.''
   He said Lockheed lawyers had informed the plaintiffs they will
move for a new trial and, failing that, will appeal the case.
   ``This could go all the way to the Supreme Court because of the
size of the punitive damages,'' Julber said.
   However, Hafif noted that the jury's award on actual damages was
far less than what the plaintiffs had requested. They had asked for
about $1.5 million and were given a total of about $376,000.

<HEAD>Government Accepts Private Bids for State Telephone Company Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government received three bids for the
state-controlled telephone company on Thursday, the deadline for
private companies interested in buying part of Telefonos de Mexico.
   One bid came from a group made up of GTE, the Mexican stock
brokerage Acciones y Valores, S.A. and Spain's Telefonica de
Espana, Treasury Department spokesman Pablo Gonzalez said.
   Another bid came from Southwestern Bell, the Mexican Grupo Carso
and France Cable and Radio, he said.
   Grupo Gentor, a majority Mexican company, placed the other bid,
he said.
   The government kept the amounts of the bids secret. It will
evaluate them by Dec. 3, then notify the winners.
   On Dec. 20, if the investors have paid the guarantee money
required, the government will announce the accepted bidder,
according to a timetable released in August.
   The timetable calls for the government to sell 20.4 percent of
its shares by that date - 10.4 percent to Mexican investors and 10
percent to foreigners.
   The overall price will be $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion for 20.4
percent of the shares in the company, also known as Telmex.
   The government holds more than $4 billion worth of shares in the
company valued at $8 billion and plans to sell all its shares
within a year.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration is
divesting itself of the phone company as part of an overall policy
of selling off state enterprises, reducing budget deficits and
trimming bureaucracy.
   Prospective investors had to deposit $10 million or prove more
than $1 billion in assets to qualify for bidding.

<HEAD>Nevada Regulators Keeping Close Eye On Bally's Nevada Casinos</HEAD>

   The Nevada Gaming Control Board has
stepped up scrutiny of Bally's resorts in Las Vegas and Reno
following word of financial problems facing their corporate parent.
   GCB Chairman Bill Bible said Thursday the board also has offered
to speed up state review of any restructuring or other resolution
that Chicago-based Bally Manufacturing proposes.
   Bible said he met with top Bally executives in late October and
discussed the problems and strategies being developed to resolve
them. He added that monitoring at the two Nevada resorts was
increased to make sure gaming obligations are met.
   The two properties have cash on hand, Bible said. ``Our primary
concern is that there is enough cash to pay off winning patrons and
to function on a day-to-day basis. There's no evidence of any cash
problems there.''
   The monitoring and offer of a quick review are ``the extent of
what we can do at this point in terms of the current business
problems,'' Bible said.
   ``From the board's perspective, we're concerned about any
licensee, large or small,'' he added. ``We're obviously concerned
when it's one of the major players in our industry.''
   On Wednesday Bally reported a third-quarter loss of $84.7
million and said it missed an $18.4 million payment to bondholders
of its Nevada casinos.
   The results for the latest quarter include $9.1 million in
litigation costs and a $69 million write-off in intangible assets,
all related to a missed payment Oct. 15 on $1.8 billion in debt
from a restructuring of Bally's Nevada casino subsidiary.
   Wednesday ended a 30-day grace period for Bally to make the loan
payment. Spokeswoman Janie Lewis said the company was still in
negotiations with its bondholders' on a debt restructuring plan.
   Bally operates four casino hotels and numerous fitness centers
across the county and also markets a line of gaming equipment and
fitness products.
   Arthur M. Goldberg, Bally's interim chief executive officer,
said the company had lower operating results in all three business
segments.
   Under a preliminary restructuring plan announced Monday, the
company would hire an agent to sell Bally's Life Fitness Inc., a
maker of fitness equipment that had sales of $70 million last year.
   The company also would scrap plans to sell its Health &amp; Tennis
Corp. subsidiary - which operates the nation's largest string of
health clubs - and withdraw from an earlier deal to acquire the
Clermont Club casino in London for $50 million.
   For the first nine months of this year, Bally had a net loss of
$67.9 million, or $2.66 per share, on revenues of $1.63 billion
compared to a loss of $29.6 million, or 88 cents a share, on
revenues of $1.57 billion for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Off Sharply</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with morning dollar, Nikkei</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged in
morning trading Friday as a weaker yen, higher interest rates and
concern about the Persian Gulf crisis discouraged investors,
traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning down
557.56 points or 2.37 percent at 22,929.92 points.
   Trading was sluggish as the Middle East crisis has made market
players cautious, particularly before the weekend, traders said.
   ``It's not that dealers are hoping for war in the Gulf, but
there's a feeling that anything can happen over the weekend'' said
Yoshiyuki Nishiguchi, a dealer at Daiwa Securities Co.
   Nishiguchi noted stock prices have been rising at the start of
the week recently, then falling as investors try to unload their
holdings before the weekend.
   The dollar stood at 129.68 yen, up 0.38 yen from Thursday's
close. After opening at 129.85 yen, morning trades ranged from
129.65 yen and 129.95 yen.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 84.41 points from Thursday's
84.47-point finish. Their yield was higher at 7.845 percent from
7.830.
   Although the dollar opened higher following its increase on
overseas markets, early trading lacked direction in the absence of
fresh market-affecting news, dealers said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said
investors were focusing more on German mark-yen trading than
dollar-yen exchanges, and purchases of the German currency were
indirectly helping to push the dollar up.
   Takeuchi said some investors are waiting for a series of
economic reports that are scheduled to come out Friday, including
the September U.S. trade figures and the October consumer price
index.
   But many traders did not foresee a radical plunge of the dollar
even if the Federal Reserve makes a long-anticipated move to lower
interest rates.
   A dealer at Mitsubishi Bank noted the dollar's range was slowly
rising and probably will hover at the 129-130 yen level. Dealers
have put the range at between mid-127 yen and 130 yen for the past
month.

   Community Newspapers Inc. said Thursday it
will repurchase a big chunk of troublesome junk-bond debt, which
was believed to play a role in the departure of publisher Ralph
Ingersoll II earlier this year.
   The newspaper chain, which publishes three dailies in Ohio, said
it had reached agreement with holders of about two-thirds of its
junk bonds to repurchase for $130 million in cash a batch of the
risky securities with a face value totaling about $240 million.
   The move is a good one for Community Newspapers because it
alleviates the company's obligation to pay the high rate of
interest on the bonds, said Ned P. Zachar, an analyst with Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Community Newspapers said in a statement that it expects to
complete the transactions by the first week of January.
   The holders of the outstanding 13 percent senior subordinated
notes due July 1, 1997, would get $95 million in cash. Holders of
subordinated discount debentures would get $35 million in cash.
   These were some of the same bonds that troubled Ingersoll, a
prominent publisher who used extensive junk-bond financing to
expand his U.S.newspaper holdings in the 1980s but encountered
difficulty making the interest payments as advertising revenue
weakened.
   In July, Community Newspapers said it couldn't make an interest
payment on some of these bonds after Ingersoll sought
unsuccessfully to repurchase them. At the same time, Ingersoll
traded his U.S. properties and their debt burden to investment
partner E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., in exchange for control of a
smaller group of European newspapers.
   Ingersoll said the deal was driven by a desire to get more
involved in European publishing. But bankers and investors said his
newspaper buying spree had left him with too much debt.
   Robert Jelenic, chief executive officer of the Journal Register
Co., said Thursday night he was pleased with the deal.
   ``This transaction is supposed to close in January, and I'll be
extremely happy. I'm pleased with the deal as it is structured,''
Jelenic said in a telephone interview from New Jersey.
   Community Newspapers publishes The Morning Journal in Lorain,
The News Herald in Lake County and the Dover-New Philadelphia Times
Reporter, all in Ohio.
