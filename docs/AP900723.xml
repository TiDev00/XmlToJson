   A woman who admitted killing and
dismembering her former husband was sentenced Monday to eight years
in prison for the death of the man witnesses said beat her and
``treated her like dirt'' for 35 years.
   A psychologist and psychiatrist testified in Washington County
Circuit Court that Juanita Irene Stinson, 57, suffered from
battered-woman syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder
following years of physical, mental and sexual abuse.
   Two of her daughters testified that their father, Charles
William Stinson, punched and kicked their mother, destroyed her
self-esteem and prevented her from leaving their home countless
times over the years.
   ``He'd wake us up in the middle of the night slapping her around
the room and beating her,'' said Irene Fickes, 35, of Williamsburg,
Pa., the Stinsons' oldest child. ``All through the years I begged
my mother to leave. She was afraid of what he would do.
   Mrs. Stinson pleaded guilty in April to second-degree murder.
She admitted fatally shooting 58-year-old Charles Stinson three
times on May 25, 1987, cutting his body into six pieces and burying
it in a shallow grave near their home.
   The two were divorced in the 1950s, but lived together as
husband and wife.
   Juanita Stinson lied about her ex-husband's whereabouts for two
years, saying he was on a business trip. He installed well cases
for gas wells and often was gone for months at a time.
   She later admitted the killing to an undercover state police
trooper, who posed as a business associate of Charles Stinson and
befriended her in early 1988.
   Washington County Circuit Judge Frederick C. Wright III called
the abuse a ``tragedy,'' but said taking an individual's life was
something the court could never condone.
   ``What I see was a determination to kill, a determination to
continue the anger by dismembering the body and a planned scheme or
charade'' to cover up death, Wright said. ``I've heard a lot about
him _ that he was not a good person, but people who are not good
people desire to live.''
   He recommended she be sent to Patuxent Institution, a state
prison which offers psychological treatment.
   Juanita Stinson, who told the judge that she was sorry and that
she loved her husband, walked out of the courtroom surrounded by
more than two dozen relatives and friends. She was ordered to turn
herself in Tuesday morning.
   Ernest Martin of Oakland, who knew the couple for more than 12
years, said Charles Stinson treated his wife ``like a dog.''
   ``He treated her like somebody would treat dirt under their
feet. He was mentally cruel to her,'' Martin said, adding that he
once saw Charles Stinson grab her and bruise her arm. ``It looked
like someone took a paint brush and painted it blue.''
   Dr. Neil Blumberg, a forensic psychiatrist, testified that the
abuse gradually eroded Juanita Stinson's self-confidence and logic,
leaving her feeling helpless and dependent on him.
   He said battered women sometimes strike out and kill their
abusers after years of tolerating their abuse when a change occurs
in their relationship, for example, if the abuse becomes more
severe or the victim becomes more concerned about her safety.
   Blumberg said she might have dismembered Charles Stinson's body
as a way of making sure that he could never abuse her again.
   ``There's an overkill reaction,'' Blumberg said. ``There is a
perception that (the abuser) is going to come back and get them
even though they clearly are no longer alive. The very gruesome
cutting up of the body ... this was a final way to assure that
didn't happen.''

   The toll from last week's killer
earthquake soared past 1,600 Tuesday, and President Corazon Aquino
asked lawmakers for a half-billion dollars to pay for recovery.
   Many accused the president of not doing enough to help their
country rebuild emotionally and physically.
   Figures from the Office of Civil Defense and the Red Cross
showed at least 1,621 people were killed when a quake measuring 7.7
on the Richter scale devastated Luzon, the main Philippine island,
on July 16. Official figures Monday had listed the death toll at
1,055 but said it was expected to rise.
   Rescuers continued digging Tuesday through the rubble of
buildings in Baguio, where more than 370 people died, and in remote
areas of mountainous northern Luzon.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, chairman of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council, said more than 3,000 people were seriously
injured and nearly 90,000 homeless.
   In a speech Monday marking the end of Congress' summer recess,
Mrs. Aquino rejected proposals to divert foreign debt payments to
finance recovery.
   She thanked foreign rescuers but omitted any reference to an
American serviceman, Marine Capt. Michael Shannon of Ashland, Ore.,
who was killed Friday when his plane crashed near Baguio on a
rescue mission.
   Mrs. Aquino also did not cite cadets of the Philippine Military
Academy in Baguio, who were the first to launch rescue operations
in that mountain resort following the quake. Graduates of the
Academy have been at the forefront of the six coup attempts against
her government.
   ``I should like to thank all of our friends throughout the world
_ governments, institutions as well as individuals _ for the
humanitarian assistance given to our people and the victims of the
earthquake,'' Mrs. Aquino told Congress.
   Mrs. Aquino said she would ask the National Disaster
Coordinating Council who to specifically thank later.
   Strong aftershocks jolted areas of Luzon island again Tuesday.
One aftershock Monday measured 4 on the Richter scale. Another sent
hundreds of people rushing into the streets of Baguio, 130 miles
north of Manila.
   During the speech, Mrs. Aquino asked for 10 million pesos, or
$500 million, ``for the repair and reconstruction of permanent
structures affected by the recent earthquake.'' The House of
Representatives unanimously approved the request and referred it to
the Senate.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to endorse congressional proposals to
suspend payments on the country's $26 billion debt to free funds
for reconstruction.
   ``It is also my hope that Congress would share with me the
concern that any move we take on the manner of debt repayment must
never jeopardize in any way our painfully built good standing with
our creditors,'' she said.
   Pro-government commentators and lawmakers said they were
surprised at the tone of the speech. Some considered it lackluster.
Several said they expected a rousing ``call to arms'' in the wake
of a major natural disaster.
   Previous states of the nation addresses were interrupted by
frequent applauses. This time, the audience gave perfunctory
applause only at the beginning and end of the speech.
   During a nationally televised commentary after the speech, Amado
Doronila, editor of the pro-government newspaper The Manila
Chronicle, said Mrs. Aquino's remarks were ``banal.''
   The speech had been expected to focus on plans to rebuild areas
devastated by the quake and to cope with the severe economic and
social dislocation.
   Much of the speech, however, dealt with past accomplishments of
the government and vague plans for development.
   ``What we wanted to hear but didn't are concrete proposals from
the Cabinet departments on how we are to continue financing our
earthquake relief and rehabilitation program while also keeping our
word of honor to our foreign creditors,'' said Rep. Ramon Mitra,
speaker of the House of Representatives.
   In Baguio, the search for survivors shifted Monday to the task
of recovering the dead. British and other foreign experts said
there were no signs of life in any of the nearly 30 buildings
devastated by the temblor.
   Many Baguio residents have been sleeping outdoors since the
quake because of continuing aftershocks. More abandoned their homes
Monday morning after a strong aftershock.
   Seismologists have recorded 629 aftershocks since the quake, 55
of which were strong enough to be felt by the populace.
   In Manila, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said he was
establishing a commission to consider criminal charges against
owners and builders of structures that collapsed during the quake.
   On Sunday, one of Mrs. Aquino's Cabinet members acknowledged
that his construction company built the Baguio Hyatt, a hotel that
collapsed during the quake. But Fiorello Estuar, secretary of
public works and highways, refused to comment on allegations by a
prominent civil engineer that the Hyatt was structurally unsound.
   Last week, Octavio Kalalo, former president of the Association
of Structural Engineers of the Philippines, said he warned in 1985
that the Hyatt could not withstand a major quake. He said his
findings were ignored.

   An electrical problem delayed
Monday's launch of an Atlas rocket with a government satellite
that's supposed to illuminate Earth's invisible magnetic field
lines by releasing chemicals in space.
   Two launch attempts Monday were called off after computers
failed to indicate whether the Atlas had switched over to internal
power. The problem apparently lay in a switch that transfers power
from the ground electrical system to batteries in the Atlas.
   ``They're just going to troubleshoot it and see what the problem
was,'' said Jack Isabel, spokesman for rocket builder General
Dynamics. ``Obviously, it's always disappointing when you can't
launch, but one of these days everything will go right and we'll
have a success.''
   Isabel said NASA wouldn't attempt a launch Tuesday, and was
uncertain when the next would be.
   Throughout the morning, there had been concern about
thunderstorms, but the weather improved and would have been fine
for the scheduled 3:26 p.m. liftoff. Sunday's launch attempt was
postponed by threatening thunderstorms.
   The first launch attempt, on Friday, was called off because of a
helium leak caused by a loose vent duct. The entire set of four
liquid helium vent ducts was replaced Saturday.
   The commercial Atlas 1 rocket was to boost the Combined Release
and Radiation Effects Satellite into an elliptical orbit 217 miles
by 22,236 miles high. The $189 million satellite is a joint program
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
Defense Department.
   Starting this fall, the 2-ton satellite is to eject 24 canisters
filled with barium, lithium and other chemicals. The released
chemicals will be ionized by the sun's ultraviolet rays, creating
large, glowing clouds.
   The clouds will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines,
illuminating them in an array of colors visible to the naked eye.
Some of the releases will resemble the aurora borealis, or the
northern lights.
   The first canisters will be released in September via ground
signals over American Samoa in the South Pacific. People in North
America will get their first glimpse of the releases in January
1991.
   Additional releases are planned next summer over the Caribbean.
Florida and the southern portions of Alabama and Georgia are
expected to be within sight range.
   The satellite originally was to have been deployed by astronauts
aboard space shuttle Challenger in 1987. But the 1986 Challenger
disaster resulted in a lengthy delay, and NASA and the Air Force
had the satellite redesigned to fit into the commercial Atlas 1
rocket.
   The launch will mark the first of a commercial Atlas and the
eighth commercial rocket launch by an American company. The San
Diego-based General Dynamics Space Systems Division provided the
$65 million rocket and launch services under a barter agreement
with NASA, which gave the company spare Atlas parts and ground
support equipment.
   NASA used earlier versions of the Atlas to boost planetary
probes and other midsize payloads.
   General Dynamics will join McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta
Corp. as America's only commercial launch providers. McDonnell
Douglas launched the nation's first commercial rocket, a Delta,
last August. Martin Marietta followed four months later with its
Titan.

<HEAD>U.S. Ships Placed On Alert As Iraq Moves Troops To Kuwaiti Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq moved 30,000 troops to its border with
Kuwait and the United States ordered its warships in the Persian
Gulf on alert, The Washington Post said in Tuesday editions.
   The reported troop buildup was attributed to unidentified
western military attaches, who were said to have seen 2,000 to
3,000 Iraqi Army vehicles moving south on a northbound trip they
were allowed to take from Kuwait to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   Kuwait supported Iraq during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran,
but Iraq is angry with Kuwait because, Iraq claims, Kuwait's oil
production beyond quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is depressing the price on world markets.
   The newspaper said the seven U.S. warships in the gulf cancelled
shore leaves and were told to be ready for sea.
   A Navy spokeswoman, Lt. Betsy Jenkins, said Monday night she had
no information on the reported alerted.
   Kuwait, whose tanker traffic was threatened by Iran, appealed to
the United States for help in 1986 and was given naval escorts for
some of its tankers put under the U.S. flag.
   The nation's armed forces are small, its army of 16,000
outnumbered by the Iraqi force on the border. Iraq has an estimated
955,000 soldiers in its Army.
   Leaders of various Middle East governments have been conferring
in recent days over Iraq's displeasure with Kuwait and related
complaints again the United Arab Emirates.
   Iraq claimed Kuwait in 1961, six days after Britain ended its a
protectorate over Kuwait. Other Arab countries and Britain sent
troops to the Iraqi-Kuwait border and Iraq did not invade.

   ``Pretty Woman'' actress Julia Roberts
described her stay in these parts as boring and the people as
racist.
   She stayed in Spartanburg and Abbeville, in the state's
northwestern corner, during filming of ``Sleeping With the Enemy''
in May.
   ``The people were horribly racist and I had a really hard
time,'' Rolling Stone magazine quoted Ms. Roberts as saying in the
Aug. 9 issue.
   ``In Abbeville, I felt so assaulted and insulted by these people
that I just didn't want to be nice anymore,'' she said.
   Abbeville Mayor Joe Savitz said her remarks may stem from her
attempt to take a black friend into a ``real redneck-type place''
that doesn't allow black customers.
   ``No self-respecting person would want to go there,'' Savitz
said.
   In her latest movie, Ms. Roberts portrays an abused wife who
stages her death and assumes a new identity. It is scheduled for
release in February.

   Fired Beatles drummer Pete Best works in an
unemployment office now and says he holds no grudges against the
Fab Four.
   Best, who lives in Liverpool, England, where the Beatles got
their start, attended a memorabilia-swapping, movie-viewing
convention for Beatles fans Saturday.
   Ringo Starr took over for Best in August 1962, just days before
the Beatles recorded a demo single of ``Love Me Do.''
   Best spent the years after his dismissal trying for a musical
career of his own. He also tried to commit suicide. Now, he says,
he's not bitter about his firing.
   ``You try to erase yourself from what happened. You can say,
`I'm going to follow right behind them,''' Best said. ``But the
space and the direction that they were going in was so great. They
were on their way to becoming mega-stars.
   ``There comes a time when you have to say, `It's not going to
happen to you,''' he said.
   Best, who works in the Liverpool unemployment office, said he
still doesn't know why he was tossed out. Explanations range from
his James Dean, leather-jacket style not suiting the Beatles'
changing image to professional jealousy.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The credit union is stealing your
money, bureaucrats are pocketing your taxes and a dozen officials
are extorting kickbacks from your business.
   What's an honest Venezuelan to do?
   He can go to court, and pay another bribe, or shoot the guilty
party and risk being shot in return.
   If he knows it's hopeless, but doesn't want to give up in
silence, he can call the publishers of the Corruption Dictionary.
   The new book, issued by Caracas newspaper publisher Carlos
Capriles, documents 68 of the most celebrated corruption cases from
1959 through 1979, the first 20 years of Venezuelan democracy.
   Readers are invited to call in with tales for the next edition,
which will bring the record up to the present.
   Telling a story of corruption might be expensive, since the
whistleblower often is the first to be punished, but at least the
Capriles staff offers a sympathetic ear.
   In the Corruption Dictionary are tales of building contracts
awarded by public officials to friends who did not even own
construction companies, and of a single building contract let to 42
different people. The ``contractor'' in one deal allegedly took off
for Mexico with a $325,000 advance.
   Readers learn of credit union directors who raided workers'
accounts to buy houses and cars for themselves.
   What of the Immigration Office? It has long been accused of
extorting bribes for residency visas, the size depending on
nationality. A Chinese had to pay $5,000, for example, but a
Portuguese could get in for $1,600.
   It is taken for granted in Venezuela that the political party in
power will finance its campaigns with state funds.
   The Corruption Dictionary is 309 pages long, compiled from
newspapers, court reports and interviews. Current events indicate
there will be plenty of material for Volume II.
   In 17 months of the administration of President Carlos Andres
Perez, stories of corrruption have turned up frequently on front
pages.
   There was the case of the theft and misuse of $6 billion in
government export subsidies.
   Businessmen were said to have collected subsidies for sending
empty boxes to Miami. Others, it is reported, shipped cocaine to
the United States in tuna fish cans, paying expenses with a
government grant.
   People copy their bosses, so the dealing also can be found at
lower levels.
   A secretary at a pharmaceutical company was accused of selling
dozens of men a cure for impotence concocted from flour and water.
   Bodies were exhumed at a Caracas cemetery to make room for new
customers.
   Subsidized milk intended for poor schoolchildren was used to
make cheese, sold to restaurants or exported to Ecuador, Peru and
Colombia.
   Few people are convicted in such cases. Each new president
promises a cleanup, and Perez is no exception, but the introduction
to Capriles' volume says:
   ``Corruption is an underlying structure that feeds and sustains
the party system and is supported by the economic, financial and
judicial institutions. ... It is also part of our social
character.''
   That may help explain why Perez has made no visible headway.
   Despite a long, well-publicized investigation of the import
subsidy scandal, no one has gone to jail.
   A court recently ordered 12 prominent people arrested on
separate charges of corruption. All of them, including former
President Jaime Lusinchi's interior minister, fled the country
before the police arrived.
   Presidents who try to do something are frustrated by an
unworkable legal system, powerless investigating commissions and,
finally, by the cynicism of a public inclined to suspect the new
crowd is the worst of all.
   Perez himself was implicated in a corruption case during a
previous presidential term, in 1975-1979, when his administration
paid $20 million for unusable refrigerator ship.
   Congress absolved him of responsibility, by one vote.

   The capital of Liberia resembles a
ghost town. Few people venture into the streets that soldiers loyal
to President Samuel Doe rule with the ferocity of men painted into
a corner.
   ``You just halt when I give you an order,'' a sergeant screamed
at a passing car Saturday, pointing his M-16 automatic rifle
straight at the driver.
   The car screeched to a halt. ``You a rebel or something?'' the
sergeant asked with nervous irritation, his finger trembling on the
trigger.
   One group of soldiers pounced on a civilian, tied his hands
behind his back and bundled him into a waiting truck. He had been
``recognized'' by one of the soldiers, his compatriots said. The
man was savagely beaten but the look on his face showed he didn't
know why.
   The soldiers, wearing shabby uniforms, were red-eyed from lack
of sleep and heavy drinking. Many soldiers have sneaked away from
this rebel-encircled capital in civilian clothes, hoping to escape
the final carnage.
   But some are caught at rebel roadblocks. The rebels look for
soldiers posing as civilians by checking their shins for marks left
by army boots.
   Youths _ most of them members of Doe's Krahn tribe _ are being
taken off the streets to be given ``emergency military training,''
as other government soldiers put it.
   That means they are issued rifles and ammunition and sent back
into the street to ``keep order.''
   Only troops manning their checkpoints in groups of three or four
are visible along Monrovia's straight avenues.
   At many points, cars stand jacked up on bricks, their wheels
missing.
   Most of Monrovia's 500,000 inhabitants are crowded into their
houses. They strain for a look at what is going on but few wander
into the open. Here and there, an army patrol fires a volley into
the air, largely to reassure itself.
   In street after street, all the shops and churches are
shuttered. The windows of many shops are smashed, a sign of
looting. Government offices are open but empty, the staff absent.
   Doe is barricaded into the Executive Mansion, guarded by an
elite unit of about 500 soldiers. Rebels were reported on Sunday to
have advanced to a mile away.
   Civilians tried to demonstrate for peace a month ago and troops
opened fire to disperse the crowd.
   Now, people seem to lack the will to take a stand.
   ``Everyone is afraid,'' said Leonine Steward, a secretary.
``It's as though all of us were playing Russian Roulette with each
other. We don't know who gets the bullet.''
   The downtown Spriggs Payne Airport is heavily guarded by
government troops. The air charter manager, Peter Seebok, recently
turned away dozens of would-be refugees for lack of space,
promising to be back for more the next day. But when the next day
came, there were no passengers waiting. The troops had taken over.
   Little, if any, food has been coming in to the city, which is
also without water, electricity and telephone service.
   Men, women and children had been carrying home buckets and
plastic containers of water from polluted streams. Now they are no
longer allowed to go out for water.
   ``All we can do is hope for rain to collect some of it for our
daily needs,'' said a man employed by an international bank that is
not functioning.
   ``But our only real hope is for the president to decide to go.
As long as he stays, there's no hope for him, or for us,'' he said.
   About 400,000 of Liberia's 2.5 million people lived in Monrovia
before the 7-month-old insurgency closed in on the capital, forcing
an exodus to the countryside and abroad.
   At a private zoo in the city, the man who runs it is afraid
hungry Monrovians will try to eat his collection of African
antelopes, called Duikers.
   Swiss taxidermist Charles Steiner, who runs the zoo as a hobby,
gets a small subsidy from the Swiss embassy and from private
companies to feed the animals and keep them from starving to death.
   The Duikers are crowded into a series of small cages on the edge
of a swamp. A white cross on a red shield tells passers-by that
Steiner and his animals are under Swiss protection.
   ``The trouble is everyone is very hungry,'' he says. ``God knows
how long I can save my animals from being eaten.''
   The Great Masonic Temple, located nearby on top of a hill, is an
empty shell. Its windows are barred and elephant grass grows in its
once-elegant yard. Government policy had been made in the building
before 1980, when Liberia was run by the descendants of freed
American slaves who founded the country in 1847.
   The American-Liberians _ called for no apparent reason the
``Congo'' tribe _ had run the country like European colonialists.
But their rule ended on April 12, 1980, when 18 Krahn
non-commissioned officers of the presidential guard stormed the
executive mansion. They killed President William R. Tolbert and
divided the Cabinet posts among themselves.
   But life in the city continued pretty much as usual.
   This time, it's different.

<HEAD>United States Struggling to Adjust to New Global Role</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a snapshot of shifting global power: A
beaming Mikhail Gorbachev and Helmut Kohl standing together and
announcing to the world an agreement that put German unification on
a fast track.
   Relegated to the sidelines for the moment, President Bush
cheered on the Soviet and German leaders with back-to-back
telephone calls. But the White House was secondary, a footnote to
the day's big story.
   There is no question that Bush has been instrumental in the
Western response to swiftly moving currents in the Eastern bloc.
But his long-distance reply to the Gorbachev-Kohl decision last
week illustrates America's changing role in the world.
   After decades of projecting global influence on the strength of
its nuclear arsenal and economic power, the United States is
struggling to adjust.
   ``America's leadership is still dominant but now it has to be
based on a bigger variety of factors than just who has the bomb,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. ``It's a greater
test of leadership to guide events in this climate.''
   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution fellow, said, ``We're not
a hapless giant, we're an important player. But it's no longer a
bipolar world'' of just the United States and Soviet Union.
   Whereas President Reagan sought to assert U.S. dominance to
counter Soviet military might, Bush offers the hand of friendship
to Moscow and strives for accommodation and conciliation with
restive Western allies.
   The Kremlin, long the chief adversary to Washington, is regarded
today as more of a welfare case as its Warsaw Pact crumbles and its
military muscle fades.
   ``We're still No. 1 militarily,'' University of Virginia
political scientist Larry Sabato said. ``The bad news is that it
doesn't matter as much as it did two or three years ago. As the
importance of the military declines, power has got to flow to Bonn
and Tokyo, in particular.''
   Indeed, West Germany, surging toward unification with East
Germany and a prosperous future, and Japan, basking in great
wealth, are the major rivals to the United States for political and
economic influence.
   While offering words of encouragement to developing democracies,
the United States is restrained by its economic problems. Tokyo
replaces Washington as the world's biggest foreign aid donor.
   Duke University political scientist James David Barber assesses
the United States as ``a secondary nation rather than as the
leading champion of democracy in the world. ...
   ``The president of the United States is not coming forth as a
person standing for global democracy but rather a person responding
to (South Africa's Nelson) Mandela, to (Czechoslovakian President
Vaclav) Havel, to (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev and trying
to wing it on the basis of the placidity of the American people,''
Barber said.
   After the seven-nation summit in London this month, America's
allies spoke comforting words on Washington's global role.
   ``There are three great groups of nations at the summit, one
based on the dollar, one based on the yen, and one based on the
deutschemark,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said, ``I hope America does
not have the idea they are sort of out of it. That is not the case.
The threat from the Soviet world has been reduced. Because of that,
Europe can assert its personality.''
   Bush acknowledges that times have changed.
   ``It doesn't work ... that you have to march in lockstep on all
these questions,'' Bush said. ``We're dealing in entirely different
times.
   ``Earlier on, in terms of the alliance, we had a much more
formidable military opposition. Now we see the Warsaw Pact in
almost a state of disarray, we see troops coming out, we see
democracies replacing totalitarian systems. So you have an entirely
different era,'' Bush said.
   Despite the new environment, the White House is determined that
the United States not appear as a passive player in global
developments.
   After Gorbachev dropped his objections to a unified Germany in
NATO, Bush felt it was necessary to offer a detailed explanation of
how the United States had helped advance German unification.
   Similarly, Bush points out that it was the United States that
charted the new direction adopted by NATO at its recent summit. The
administration also credits itself with leading the West toward
conventional arms cuts in Europe and arranging assistance for
Poland, Hungary and other emerging democracies.
   Political scientist Sabato observed that, ``American power
doesn't matter as much any more. On the other hand, which country
are these newly emerging democracies emulating? It's the United
States and Thomas Jefferson that they're quoting.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Without Brennan to be More Conservative</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His first appointment to the Supreme Court may
give President Bush an indirect voice on the future of legalized
abortion in the United States _ providing Bush a supersensitive
election-year decision that will reverberate in law and politics
for years to come.
   The retirement of the court's leading liberal, Justice William
J. Brennan, will give the court a more conservative bearing.
Abortion rights is now the center of attention, but the court is
closely divided on other important social issues, such as civil
rights and criminal justice, splitting 5-4 in numerous cases.
   Speaking a month before Brennan's retirement on Friday, Justice
Harry A. Blackmun predicted the inevitable departure of the court's
three liberal octogenarians _ himself, Brennan and Justice Thurgood
Marshall _ would leave conservatives in control for decades to come.
   ``We shouldn't resent it,'' Blackmun said. ``That's the way the
system works. That pendulum swings. It will stay this way now 40 or
50 years, I'm sure.''
   All eyes are on Roe vs. Wade.
   There now appear to be four votes _ Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony
M. Kennedy _ to overturn the court's 1973 ruling that established a
constitutional right to abortion.
   There also appear to be four votes opposing such a move.
   Blackmun, Marshall and Justice John Paul Stevens are strong
supporters of abortion rights. And the generally conservative
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has refused so far to cast the fifth
vote to reverse Roe vs. Wade and let states outlaw abortion.
   The political stakes are enormous.
   Republicans took a drubbing in several 1989 elections where
abortion was a key issue. Looking ahead to 1992, Bush may be
reluctant to be identified as the president who nudged the court
into overturning Roe vs. Wade.
   The 1990 election year seems pretty sleepy right now, but an
abortion rights debate could ignite plenty of November drama. Some
senators were advising Bush against any anti-abortion ``litmus
test'' for picking Brennan's successor.
   `If you have to have someone who wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade,
it's going to be a bloodbath getting the nomination confirmed,''
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Sunday, ``and the same is
true on the other side.''
   Georgetown University law professor Eleanor Holmes Norton
expects the subject to dominate confirmation proceedings. ``You can
bet your bottom dollar that sitting in the Senate are going to be
men ... who will insist on bringing out the views of the justice on
this issue,'' she said.
   The president's announced intention to replace Brennan with a
``strict constructionist'' means a rightward-moving court will get
even more conservative.
   The impact of Brennan's leaving because of poor health goes
beyond the mere loss of a liberal vote, and reflects on the
personal dynamics of the court as a political institution.
   Combining keen intellect and charismatic charm, Brennan was a
master politician and coalition builder who for years blunted
conservative gains.
   Part of his behind-the-scenes persona including using law clerks
as lobbyists in the offices of his fellow justices and writing
persuasive memos to fence-sitting court members.
   In recent years, if one or more of the court's conservative
justices could be attracted to the liberal side of an issue, it was
Brennan doing the wooing.
   None of the three remaining liberals _ Blackmun, Marshall or
Stevens _ can assume that role easily.
   ``No one will fill those shoes,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a
University of Virginia law professor.
   Although less successful against Rehnquist's conservative
leadership since 1986, Brennan still could claim some victories.
   In the 1989-90 term that ended in June, Brennan led the court as
it upheld a federal affirmative action plan giving minorities
special consideration in awarding television and radio licenses and
struck down a ban on flag-burning. Both cases were decided by 5-4
votes.
   The affirmative action ruling surprised and delighted many civil
rights activists who in recent years have criticized the court's
decisions making racial and sexual discrimination more difficult to
prove.
   Brennan, who joined the court in 1956, was a leader of the
liberal majority that through the 1960s expanded individual rights
and mandated greater equality for the nation's minorities.
   But more recently a increasingly conservative court has
curtailed some of the legal doctrines he fashioned, particularly
those that limited police powers.
   Brennan's successor will join a court now more likely to give
greater weight to the frustrations of law enforcement officials
than to the asserted rights of those suspected of crime.

<HEAD>NY Republicans Shaking Heads Over Their Candidate For Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are using some unexpected
expressions to describe their candidate for governor in New York.
Words like ``brainless wonder,'' ``buffoon'' and just plain ``sad.''
   Economist Pierre Rinfret was the GOP's last-minute choice to run
for governor after a host of other prominent Republicans refused to
tackle Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   But Rinfret's outspoken manner has been creating controversy
ever since he was ``discovered'' and recruited by desperate party
officials in May.
   First, it turned out he wasn't really a registered Republican,
even though he initially insisted he was. He's since switched his
status from independent to Republican.
   The state GOP convention, where Rinfret was nominated, was
marred by a battle over a pro-choice abortion plank in the
Republican platform. Rinfret was adamant it be kept in and it was.
   Since the convention, Rinfret has called for the possible sale
of the New York City subway system and invited a female Albany
television reporter to his inauguration _ with the suggestion that
she leave her husband at home.
   He has said Cuomo ``doesn't work at all'' as governor and was
``chicken'' for going to college instead of fighting in the Korean
War.
   On a visit to Washington, Rinfret and several other Republican
gubernatorial hopefuls had their pictures taken with President Bush.
   ``We were like cattle through a chute,'' Rinfret reported.
   Last week, Rinfret criticized Cuomo for having two of his
children on his campaign payroll.
   ``That's money he's raised for his campaign. Why is he making it
a family dole?'' Rinfret said, adding that his own children ``work
for free.''
   A day later, a contrite Rinfret sent Cuomo a note apologizing
for the ``inappropriate'' remarks.
   The GOP candidate also has blasted Republicans who wouldn't run
for governor as ``gutless wonders.''
   His outspoken manner hasn't gone over well with all GOP leaders.
   Peter King, one of those who declined to challenge Cuomo,
labeled Rinfret ``the brainless wonder.''
   ``Sad, sad, sad,'' said U.S. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp,
another who refused to run against Cuomo.
   ``Mr. Rinfret has become the national laughingstock of the 1990
elections,'' said Michael Long, chairman of the New York
Conservative Party. The Conservatives, who normally back statewide
Republican tickets, have selected their own gubernatorial candidate
this year.
   ``This guy is incredible, one gaffe after another; he runs
around offending people,'' said state Assemblyman John Cochrane,
the GOP leader in Long Island's Suffolk County.
   Cochrane said he and another state senator met privately with
Rinfret last month to urge him to think ahead about the
consequences of his remarks.
   Rinfret insists he got no such advice.
   ``I'm the gubernatorial candidate,'' he said. ``I haven't
changed. I'm not going to. ... I think the Republican Party is
getting very used to me. They're very pleased with me.''
   Last week, Cuomo reported that $8.3 million had been raised for
his re-election bid. Rinfret said he had raised $870,000, of which
$500,000 was a loan from himself.
   GOP consultant Roger Stone acknowledges Cuomo is likely to score
a big victory in November. But Stone says the competition _ Rinfret
_ is so weak that Cuomo's victory won't mean much.
   ``I mean who did he beat? He beat this buffoon Rinfret. Tough!''
Stone said last week.
   ``You have a candidate who is obviously highly intelligent, but
who just has no experience at being a candidate. And it shows,'' he
said.
   Stone said that while Rinfret's candidacy is ``not good for the
Republican Party,'' it's also ``not good for Cuomo. Cuomo needs to
at least make it appear like he beat a credible challenger.''
   Cuomo political aides are insisting that Rinfret is part of a
Washington-based Republican attempt to ``bloody'' Cuomo before the
1992 presidential campaign begins. They note that Bush drug adviser
William Bennett and other allies of the president have attacked
Cuomo during recent stops in New York state.
   ``Rinfret is just a rented car, rented by Bush,'' said veteran
Cuomo political operative William Cunningham.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Nation's Agriculture Leader _ In Farmland Price Per
Acre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no way tiny Rhode Island can be the
top farm state. Except in one category: average value of farmland.
   But that's only one of the 14 categories used by the Agriculture
Department to rank states according to their farm characteristics.
   Texas is No. 1 in six of the categories; Iowa, three;
California, two; and Arizona, Arkansas and Rhode Island one each.
   The rankings by the department's Economic Research Service were
reported in the agency's July issue of Farmline magazine, based
entirely upon statistical numbers relating to values, size,
inventories and other factors.
   A chart was used to show the placings, and analysts prudently
avoided saying which state was the best, most beautiful, cleanest,
warmest, coldest or anything else.
   Some of the figures were for 1990, but most reflected economic
and statistical material for 1989 and 1988.
   Texas led in the number of farms with 186,000; the amount of
land in farms, 132 million acres; the total value of farmland and
buildings, $66.9 billion; the number of cattle, 13.6 million; the
number of sheep and lambs, 1.87 million; and cash receipts from
livestock marketings, $6.5 billion.
   Iowa was first in the amount of land planted to major field
crops, 24.9 million acres; the number of hogs and pigs, 14 million;
and the amount of direct federal subsidies paid to farmers, $1.67
billion.
   California led the nation in the amount of cash receipts from
crop marketings, $11.9 billion; and in the amount of net cash
income from farming, $6.54 billion.
   Arizona was No. 1 in the average size of farms at 4,444 acres.
Arkansas was tops in broiler production with 920 million birds. And
Rhode Island was first in the average value of farmland at $5,080
per acre.
   Because cash receipts from farming are so important to the
agricultural balance sheet, California is often described as the
top farm state.
   With crop receipts at $11.9 billion and livestock at $4.7
billion, that put California's total farm marketings at $16.6
billion. Texas, the leader in livestock sales of $6.5 billion, had
crop marketings of $3.78 billion, making a total of about $10.3
billion.
   The chart showed eight placings in each of the 14 categories.
Here are several examples of those ratings, in order:
   Number of farms _ Texas, 186,000; Missouri, 108,000; Iowa,
105,000; Kentucky, 96,000; Tennessee, 91,000; Minnesota, 90,000;
Ohio, 87,000; and Illinois, 86,000.
   Land in farms _ Texas, 132 million acres; Montana, 60.6 million;
Kansas, 47.9 million; Nebraska, 47.1 million; New Mexico, 44.5
million; South Dakota, 44.3 million; North Dakota, 40.5 million;
and Arizona 36 million.
   Net cash income from farming _ California, $6.54 billion; Texas,
$3.89 billion; Iowa, $3.44 billion; Florida, $3.05 billion;
Minnesota, $2.72 billion; Nebraska, $2.68 billion; Illinois, $2.63
billion; and Wisconsin, $2.22 billion.

   Cattle prices are up this year and so are most
cuts of beef at the supermarket, the government says.
   Last week's consumer price index released by the Labor
Department for June showed the all-cut retail price of Choice-grade
beef at a record of nearly $2.89 per pound, up from $2.87 in May.
   Retail beef prices have been setting records since last
November, says the Agriculture Department. Prices are expected to
gain 3 percent to 7 percent in 1990 from last year.
   The department's Economic Research Service said 1990 beef output
will be down slightly from last year, due to reduced slaughter of
non-fed cattle.
   Choice steer prices are forecast to average $73 to $77 per
hundredweight this year, up from $72.52 in 1989.
   Labor's consumer report also showed retail pork prices at more
than $2.18 per pound on an all-cut basis, up about 12 cents from
May.
   The USDA forecasts retail pork prices may gain 8 percent to 12
percent this year, compared with the 1989 all-cut average of $1.83
per pound.
   Commercial pork production this year is expected to be down
about 3 percent from 1989. Hog prices may average in the mid-$50s
per hundredweight, up about $11 from last year.
   The department's livestock economists said hog farmers have had
profitability in the hog business since January but that
``producers are expected to take a cautious approach in adding
breeding stock'' to their herds.
   ``In previous hog cycles, producers began increasing the
breeding inventory after about six months of sustained positive
returns,'' the agency said in a recent report. ``The recent run up
in corn prices and prospects for higher feed costs through most of
1991 cloud the profit picture.''
   Also, the report said, lower hog prices in June ``raise the
specter of a sharp drop in prices in late summer as production
increases seasonally.''

   Catfish farmers have been getting higher
prices than they did a year ago, despite larger production,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Production in June was about 29 million pounds, up 5 percent
from a year earlier, the report said. Prices paid to growers for
fish delivered to processors averaged 79 cents per pound of live
weight, up four cents from June 1989.
   Catfish production in the first six months was about 189.6
million pounds, up 12 percent from the same period of 1989.

<HEAD>$1,868 for a Toilet Cover? Welcome to the Air Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latrines on Navy ships and Air Force planes
are taking on the look of the executive washroom, congressional
investigators say.
   Cover assembly for toilets on the Air Force's C-5B transport
aircraft _ $1,868. Urinal for a Navy minesweeper _ $641. Rubber
gaskets to seal drainage holes on airborne toilet systems _ $67.50
each.
   Tales of overpriced porcelain and rich rubber are only the
latest from investigators who uncovered the recent Pentagon
acquisitions of $999 pliers and $117 soap dish covers.
   Two Republican senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and William
Roth of Delaware, have called for an audit to determine whether the
overpricing and system problems ``are as prevalent today as they
were in the mid-1980s.''
   The Pentagon's inspector general, Susan J. Crawford, has
promised to conduct an investigation.
   In the meantime, money seems to be going down the toilet.
   The government in October 1988 purchased two urinals priced at
$641.25 each from a Fairfield, N.J., company, Williams &amp; Watts
Inc., according to documents obtained by The Associated Press from
investigators.
   The purchasing trail for the urinals extended to several
companies. Williams &amp; Watts bought the urinals from Chamberlain
Manufacturing Co., Gard Division, of Niles, Ill., for $475 apiece.
Chamberlain told investigators they purchased the urinals from Paul
Supply for $281. Paul Supply said they paid $150 each to Crane@Fiat
for the urinals.
   Investigators, who questioned a Crane representative on why the
company does not sell directly to the government, was told,
``That's how the game is played.''
   A program manager for Williams &amp; Watts said the company examined
government procurement history files and found that Chamberlain is
``the only known and approved source of supply of this product.''
Scott Adler said his company, which serves as the dealer for
Chamberlain, believed the company was the actual manufacturer.
   According to Adler, Chamberlain sought to meet the strict
military requirements for the urinals, which included shock and
vibration tests. The Navy also requires that since the urinals will
be on minesweepers, they be non-magnetic. The urinals are made of
porcelain with brass valves.
   Adler confirmed that his company paid $475 to Chamberlain for
the urinals and then sold them to the government for $641, a markup
of 35 percent that included various company expenses.
   An official at Chamberlain said the person designated to
comment, Dr. William Byrne, was unavailable.
   Investigators also discovered that in 1984, Chamberlain sold
nine of the same urinals directly to the government for $180 each.
   The Air Force purchased the toilet cover assembly, a
steel-reinforced plastic sheet that covers the top of the toilet,
for a price of $1,868.15, investigators said.
   The cover, which is manufactured by Weber Aircraft, is 34 inches
by 28 inches and two are usually installed on C-5B transport
aircraft.
   Investigators also found that the government bought four of the
drain valve seals at a cost of $67.50 each for use on airborne
toilet systems in military aircraft.
   The seals are rubber gaskets which are used between a drainage
hole and the plug which covers it in toilets.

<HEAD>Postcard Campaign Seeks Release of US Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Organizers of a postcard campaign seeking the
release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon are asking the public to send a
new wave of cards to the White House in hopes of bringing home the
remaining six American captives.
   The first campaign _ in which 450,000 postcards were mailed to
President Bush _ was started last year to show the administration
that the public cares about the hostages and wants them released,
said Anne Zickl, who is running the campaign for the Journalists'
Committee to Free Terry Anderson.
   Anderson, the Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent,
was taken hostage March 16, 1985. He has been held the longest of
the six Americans and 10 hostages from other countries.
   Zickl said White House statements about the hostages changed
after the first postcard campaign began.
   ``From that time on, the administration has been saying what the
Reagan administration never said _ that we will talk to anyone to
bring about the release of these innocent people,'' she said.
   ``We do believe that the heightened awareness across the country
helped bring about the release of (Robert) Polhill and (Frank)
Reed,'' she said.
   Reed, director of the Lebanese International School, was freed
April 30 after 3{ years in captivity. Polhill, assistant professor
at Beirut University College, was held almost 2{ years before being
released April 22.
   Zickl said the idea for the postcard campaign started with a
journalist committee member who heard a State Department official
say the American people didn't care about the hostages.
   That's not true, said Zickl.
   ``The American people are not passive on issues of human rights
if they are informed,'' she said. She said that once the campaign
started getting publicity, she couldn't answer the telephone fast
enough.
   ``I had people call me and say `we didn't even know those people
were still there,''' she said.
   The new campaign began July 4. The postcard carries photographs
of the hostages with the message:
   ``A nation that chooses not to pursue freedom for an innocent
captive resigns its own freedom. Those who choose not to listen
will themselves cry out and never be heard.''
   A note to Bush on the card urges him to intensify his
administration's efforts to win freedom for the six U.S. hostages.
   Besides Anderson, the remaining hostages and dates they were
kidnapped are Thomas Sutherland, June 9, 1985; Joseph James
Cicippio, Sept. 12, 1986; Edward Austin Tracy, Oct. 21, 1986; Jesse
Turner and Alann Steen, both Jan. 24, 1987.
   The committee include journalists from the broadcast and
newspaper industry, including network anchors and national news
executives.
   The postcards are being distributed by the journalists'
committee at cost _ $14 for 250 cards _ and can be ordered by
calling or writing Anne Zickl, P.O. Box 652, Batavia, N.Y. 14021,
716-343-6198.

   When you're bored by ``Batman'' and
depressed by the relentless good cheer of ``The Sound of Music,''
perhaps it's time to load the VCR with a tape from the Video
Vault's collection of celluloid turkeys.
   ``Guaranteed Worst Movies in Town,'' reads a signboard on the
tree-shaded sidewalk outside Jim McCabe's video store in this
genteel suburb south of Washington D.C.
   McCabe isn't kidding.
   Video Vault is B-movie heaven, an emporium of Tinseltown
disasters, a supermarket of film schlock with such titles as
``Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,'' ``I Was a Zombie for the
FBI'' and ``Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy.''
   Here are enshrined the long-forgotten relics of Republic,
Monogram and other low-budget studios of the 1930s and 1940s, where
there was no retake if an actor flubbed his lines or a boom mike
suddenly swooped over a lovers' embrace.
   McCabe's inventory of more than 18,000 videocassette tapes at
two locations includes the usual array of new Hollywood releases,
the bread and butter of the video rental business. But he
attributes his financial success to Video Vault's stock of
hard-to-find foreign art films, pre-1950s classics and cult movie
atrocities.
   He boasts several copies of ``Detour,'' a 1945 film noir which
McCabe says is ``probably the most famous B movie ever made.''
Featuring a cast of three obscure actors, it was shot on a $21,000
budget in just six days on two sets _ a hotel room and the inside
of an automobile.
   There are stomach-churning two-reelers by H.G. Lewis, ``the
godfather of gore,'' the cult classic ``Reefer Madness,'' Russ
Meyer's ``Mondo Topless'' and other bosomy epics, ``Cannibal
Holocaust,'' ``Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks,'' and Ed D.
Wood Jr.'s ``Night of the Ghouls,'' hailed as ``the ultimate in
cheap, trashy horror films.''
   Wood, incidentally, is considered the worst director of all time
and his ``Plan 9 from Outer Space'' is a blue-ribbon staple at
festivals of the worst movies ever made, McCabe said.
   ``Wood was dead serious, but the guy was so inept that when
people see his stuff they say `My God, I can't believe this.' They
fall out of their seats and roll on the floor. His movies are so
bad they're entertaining.''
   McCabe, 40, is a trained psychologist ho suffered burnout after
seven years of working in the state mental hospital in his native
Columbia, S.C. He moved to Washington in 1980 as a Reagan
administration appointee in the Education Department. ``It was
zombieland,'' he said.
   ``I've always been a movie buff, so five years ago I said what
the hell, let's roll the dice and see what happens,'' McCabe said.
He rented the rear of a converted townhouse in historic Alexandria
and put 500 movie tapes on the shelves.
   McCabe spent long hours scouring the fine print of obscure
distributors' and collectors' catalogs for ``the good movies that
you don't find anywhere else,'' and his business boomed. He opened
a second outlet in Washington's fashionable Georgetown neighborhood
last January, and offers mail-order rentals to subscribers in more
than 40 states and British Columbia.
   McCabe estimates he will gross more than $1 million this year,
an unusual achievement in a highly competitive industry dominated
by such giant chains as Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., West Coast Video Ltd. of Philadelphia and Erol's,
a local firm.
   ``I warn the little guys out there that this a serious game, a
tough business, and you've got to find your niche or you'll get
swallowed up by the big guys,'' he said.
   McCabe has found his niche. You can find it, too, on the racks
labeled ``Saturday Night Sleazies'' and ``Drive-In Madness.'' Look
no further than ``Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla'' or ``Girl
on a Chain Gang.''
   And don't miss ``Guide to Safe Sex,'' a compilation of 1940s sex
education films. The one with a couple of grinning bobby-soxers on
the cover and this warning label: ``Don't Touch That Zipper Until
You See This Tape.''

<HEAD>Amnesty International Calls for Release of Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International called on Cameroon's
government today to release two prisoners jailed after trying to
set up a political party in the one-party state.
   Former bar association president Yondo Mandengue Black and
Anicet Ekane, a company director, were sentenced to 3- and 4-year
prison terms by a special military court in April, the London-based
human rights group said.
   ``Their trial was a travesty of justice _ there was no
convincing evidence to justify their conviction and details of the
charges were withheld from the defendants throughout the trial,''
Amnesty said in a statement.
   The two men were among 10 people arrested in Feburary and tried
on charges of subversion and showing contempt for President Paul
Biya, Amnesty said.
   It said Yondo and Ekane were imprisoned and the others were
given suspended prison sentences or acquitted.
   Amnesty said the treatment of the men and the unfairness of
their trial strongly suggests their arrests and convictions were
politically motivated.
   The defendants were illegally detained and held mostly
incommunicado for several weeks after their arrests, the statement
said. Two of the men were reportedly tortured, it said.
   Ekane said he had been stripped, beaten and forced to remain
standing without food or water for three days, Amnesty said.
   One of the laywers defending the men was killed by police on the
last day of the trial, and other lawyers received death threats or
threats against their practices, the human rights group said.
   The trial itself was described as ``Kafkaesque.'' Defendants
were not given details of the charges they faced and were denied
time to confer with lawyers or prepare a defense, it said.
   Documents used as evidence against them included two drafts of
an appeal for signatures in support of political change and a draft
article for publication by an exiled opposition group, Amnesty said.
   There was no evidence that the documents advocated overthrow of
the government or that they had been published or distributed, the
statement noted.
   Amnesty said both the imprisoned men suffer serious health
problems. It said they have little prospect of regular visits from
relatives who could bring them food and medicine.
   Amnesty believes the men have been imprisoned solely for their
non-violent political activities and are prisoners of conscience.

   Here is a brief description of the eight
remaining justices of the Supreme Court.
   William Rehnquist, 65, appointed to the court in 1971 by
President Richard Nixon and appointed chief justice by President
Ronald Reagan in 1986. Once a frequent dissenter, he now is
generally acknowledged as the leader of the court's working
conservative majority. Rehnquist is well liked by his colleagues,
who praise him for his informal, genial style.
   Byron R. White, 73, appointed to the court in 1962 by President
John Kennedy. White generally votes with the conservatives,
although his deference to federal power can produce some
contrasting results. He voted with the liberals last month to
uphold a key federal affirmative action program. He is among the
court's most avid questioners of lawyers during oral arguments and
can be abrasive.
   Thurgood Marshall, 82, appointed to the court in 1967 by
President Lyndon Johnson. Brennan's most consistent ally, Marshall
is the only black ever named to the court and is a figure of
historic importance in the civil rights movement. But critics say
his interest in court work has flagged in recent years. Marshall
has been an outspoken critic of Reagan and has vowed to remain on
the court as long as he is alive.
   Harry A. Blackmun, 81, appointed to the court in 1970 by Nixon.
He is best known as the author of the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade
that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.
Once labeled a conservative ``twin'' of former Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger, he has cast generally liberal votes in recent years.
   John Paul Stevens, 70, appointed to the court in 1975 by
President Gerald Ford. He is a maverick whose intellectual
brilliance has been overshadowed by his independence. He generally
votes with the liberals but is unpredictable. He was with the
dissenters who voted to uphold laws against flag burning. Stevens
is known for his bow tie and his incisive, and unfailingly polite,
questioning of lawyers at oral arguments.
   Sandra Day O'Connor, 60, appointed to the court in 1981 by
Reagan. The only woman ever to be a justice, she has controlled the
balance of power until now on abortion issues. She also has been a
swing vote on affirmative action. O'Connor is generally
conservative but has provided some key liberal votes, particularly
on issues affecting women's rights. She is hardworking and not
given to broad pronouncements or sweeping rulings. She underwent a
mastectomy last year and says her cancer has been cured.
   Antonin Scalia, 54, appointed to the court in 1986 by Reagan. A
scholar and jurist of unquestioned brilliance, he has tried to pull
the court further to the right and has been outspoken in
criticizing conservative colleagues who prefer incremental change.
Scalia has a libertarian streak and strict adherence to
constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise. He
cast a recent dissenting vote when the court refused to grant child
abuse suspects the right to confront their young accusers in court.
   Anthony M. Kennedy, 53, appointed to the court in 1988 by
Reagan. The court's newest member solidified a conservative
majority but says he has felt no special pressure in being a
pivotal figure. An unassuming Californian, he was Reagan's third
choice for a vacancy created by the retirement of centrist Justice
Lewis F. Powell. Kennedy's major defections from the conservative
camp were his votes to strike down laws against flag burning.

<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's high tourist season in Santa
Cruz, but only on one side of town.
   Tanned, oil-slicked bodies adorn the main beach. Thousands more
visitors pack the garish amusement parks that line the 1907
boardwalk.
   But just two miles inland, the other foremost tourist attraction
in this city of 50,000 has been transformed by the Oct. 17
earthquake into a zone of shattered buildings, craters and
scaffolding.
   ``The heart of Santa Cruz has been ripped out, and it's not
being replaced,'' said Julie Chapton of the once-thriving Pacific
Garden Mall, a district of coffeehouses, boutiques and restaurants
that she frequently visited from her home in Scotts Valley, just
north of the city.
   ``It tears your heart out when you come down here,'' she said.
   Officials say it could be anywhere from three years to a decade
before the six-block district is rebuilt and booming again.
   The Northern California quake, measuring 7.2 on the Richter
scale, was centered 10 miles from Santa Cruz, which overlooks
Monterey Bay. Nearly half the mall was badly damaged or destroyed,
and three people were killed.
   So far, the city has tallied $112 million in quake damage,
including $51 million to businesses. Tourism remains strong, but
visitors are drawn mainly to beach areas largely untouched by the
quake.
   Locals who shy away from the tourist-clogged boardwalk sorely
miss the tree-lined mall, which was a popular rendezvous.
Rebuilding work is taking too long, they say.
   The city's finance director, Bob Shepherd, said reconstruction
will be slow because the new buildings must meet regulations
governing quake-proofing. He thinks it could be 10 years before the
district is back on its feet.
   ``The downtown is an absolute wreck,'' Shepherd said. ``People
compare it to Hiroshima right after the bomb. It's really a
depressing thing.''
   Mental health workers say the rubble can leave passersby
depressed and anxious. Project COPE, a federally funded quake
counseling group run by the city, has treated 16,000 people in the
last eight months, said supervisor Jill Hofmann.
   ``It's hard to work in that area because you are constantly
surrounded by what looks like a war zone,'' she said.
   The city has lost about half its yearly $1 million in sales tax
revenue, officials say.
   About 100 of the city's 630 businesses never resurfaced after
the disaster. Others work out of tent-like plastic pavilions set up
a block from the mall, struggling on sales that are sometimes 25
percent of pre-quake levels.
   But there are signs of renewal.
   The mall's Palomar Hotel should be ready for occupancy by the
end of the year. Investors recently bought the mall site of the
quake-leveled Gottschalk's department store, and a 400-car parking
lot is being built alongside. No decision has been made on what
will be built where the store stood.
   The Natural Treasures gift shop lost about $1,500 worth of goods
in the quake, and sales have slumped by more than 50 percent, said
its manager, Frank Morgan.
   ``For the most part, I think everybody lost out,'' he said.
``But on the other hand, we're very lucky to be here.''

<TEXT>
   A team of eight U.S. and Soviet climbers unfurled
national flags and peace banners atop Mount Rainier before
completing Sunday the first of four climbs in honor of the Goodwill
Games.
   The team reached the 14,410-foot summit at about 10 a.m.
Saturday, the day of opening ceremonies in Seattle for the
Olympics-style athletics competition, said Bryan Rozewski, one of
the American climbers.
   The team carried flags from each country, Goodwill Games banners
and a memorial wreath for 40 Soviet climbers who died in an
avalanche last week on Peak Lenin in Soviet Central Asia, Rozewski
said.
   They also unrolled a banner that said ``Peace'' and its Russian
equivalent, ``Mir.'' Team members stayed at the summit for about
seven hours, enjoying the view and napping on rocks, Rozewski said.
   They began climbing the state's highest peak Friday and stayed
at a base camp 9,510 feet up on Friday and Saturday nights.
   ``It was fun when we got to the top,'' Rozewski, 28, of Seattle,
said from a celebration party. ``There was a lot of energy.
Everybody wanted to pick up a flag and wave it.''
   The climb was led by Paul S. McKinney, 32, of Seattle, a Mount
Rainier veteran who also has scaled the other major peaks in the
state, Rozewski said.
   Other U.S. climbers were David Lewis, 28, and Don Mason, 32,
both from Seattle.
   Two other Americans joined them at the top but were not official
members of the expedition.
   The Soviet group was led by Andrei Rozkov, 29, and included Alex
Slutjuk, 28, Vassily Elagin, 37, and Irina Miller, 35, all of
Moscow.
   Rozewski said the climb was sponsored by the Mir Corporation, a
Seattle-based firm which organizes U.S.-Soviet exchanges, and
Profsport, a Soviet sports organization.
   The Soviets plan to join other American mountaineers and climb
three more Washington peaks later this week, Rozewski said.
   Just hours after the Rainier climb was completed, the
mountaineers headed south to the 8,364-foot Mount St. Helens, an
active volcano that erupted in 1980. That ascent will begin Monday.
   Climbs are also planned for Wednesday up 9,415-foot Mount Stuart
and Friday up 5,979-foot Mount Index, two peaks in the Cascade
range.
   ``They want to try and climb all the mountains here they can,''
Rozewski said.
   The visit by the Soviet climbers is one of several international
exchanges being held in conjunction with the games, which run
through Aug. 5.
   Rozewski said the Soviets are experienced mountaineers, while
most of the American participants were recreational climbers and
relatively inexperienced.
   The Americans, linked by ropes during much of the expedition,
took about seven hours to complete the final leg of the climb,
while the Soviets, who climbed separately, took only four hours, he
said.
   ``They had more stamina than we did,'' he said.

   The prairie grass still rustles and the
buffalo still roam on Fred Tromp's place, a mom-and-pop wildlife
refuge where the public can learn about ancient Indians or look at
native wildflowers.
   Tromp, a retiree with a full head of white hair and thick arms
muscled from years of work, turned his family's farmstead back to
nature more than 30 years ago, charging $2.50 a head for a visit to
his Little Mackinaw Wildlife Park.
   ``This is my life,'' he said recently as he surveyed the rolling
hills and the stands of timber where his father and grandfather
once farmed with horse-drawn equipment. ``I don't smoke or drink.
That's not my entertainment.''
   The 400-acre park, 20 miles south of Peoria, is open on
Saturdays and Sundays only. Tromp, 52, commutes to the park from
his home in nearby Pekin for extended stays at a cabin on the land.
   ``If I want entertainment I come out here and mow, or build
fence or fish. I love it here and just want to provide something
for people to come and experience what I do here,'' he said.
   Tromp, a father of seven who runs the park with his wife,
restocked the land with native animals _ about two dozen bison,
about 40 white-tailed deer and sheep.
   The park is Tromp's way of exposing the curious to swamps,
prehistoric Indian culture, the beauty of prairie wildflowers and
the solitude found in the woods.
   He let the prairie grasses grow and built a display on Indians
who once lived on the land.
   ``Visiting Fred's park is more interesting than just about
anything on television,'' said Ralph Hubbard, a regular visitor
from nearby Hopedale.
   ``You get to see a little bit of everything _ the buffalo, wild
geese, deer, tourists. The buffalo are fascinating. And if you look
around you'll probably find some Indian artifacts.''
   The cabin, one room with no running water or electricity, is
attached to a gazebo and dock that overlook a pond, where ducks and
Canada geese splash and the various wildlife drink.
   When the weather is hot and humid, the bison, sheep and deer
disappear into the woods and brush, making sightings scarce by
visitors.
   To keep them happy, Tromp walks ahead of guests, disappearing
into the woods for several minutes before reappearing behind a herd
of bison.
   The land is strewn with shards of pottery, spear points and
other artifacts linked by archaeologists to Indian tribes that
lived between 8,000 to 10,000 B.C. and A.D. 600 to 800.
   Aerial photos tipped scientists to the existence of a mound
built by prehistoric Indians carrying dirt in baskets. It is
unclear whether the site is a burial mound or a location for
ceremonies.
   Tromp erected a display at the mound with stone spear tips, ax
heads, drills and other artifacts he found during his work on the
land.
   ``I'll spend the rest of my life here, I hope,'' he said.

   The same Senate committee that presided over
conservative Robert Bork's nationally televised ordeal three years
ago awaits President Bush's choice for the latest vacancy on the
Supreme Court.
   Depending on the kind of candidate Bush picks, the confirmation
hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee could be every bit
as tough.
   ``There is going to be an above-average amount of scrutiny
because it represents inevitably a shifting in the court,'' said
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who played a prominent role in the Bork
hearings in 1987.
   Bork, at the time an appeals court judge, failed to win
confirmation in a vote on the Senate floor.
   It was in his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, however, that the former law professor and Justice
Department official started running into trouble.
   The committee combed his writings for evidence that he was out
of the mainstream. Panel members took him to task for matters
ranging from not doing free legal work for the poor to not finding
any right to privacy within the Constitution.
   The latest vacancy occurs as a result of the resignation Friday
of 84-year-old Justice William J. Brennan, a leading supporter on
the court of civil rights and individual liberties.
   The announcement delighted conservatives and caused concern
among liberals who have watched the court march steadily toward the
political right since the start of the Reagan administration.
   Both sides believe Bush is likely to nominate a candidate who
will buttress the court's conservative majority and sap the power
of the court's ``swing voters'' to temper rulings.
   ``The liberal community is going to be upset because they have
controlled that court for 30 years,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, the No. 2 Republican on the Judiciary Committee and a Bork
supporter three years ago.
   Hatch himself was mentioned as a possibility for the court in
the Reagan era but less frequently over the last year.
   In any case, he says he would rather stay in the Senate. A
conservative whose unpredictability at times irks other
conservatives, Hatch is guaranteed a major role as the committee
weighs Bush's nominee.
   Concern about how greatly the nominee would accelerate the
court's rightward drift is heightened by the emotional issue of
abortion as well as a host of individual rights questions that the
justices must resolve.
   Committee liberals such as Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, are certain to put every detail of
the candidate's legal background and personal character under the
magnifying glass.
   Metzenbaum, over the weekend, reacted to Brennan's resignation
by expressing hope Bush would nominate ``someone who everybody
would agree is not an ideologue, not a candidate of the far right.''
   Democrats, who have a majority in the Senate, control the
Judiciary Committee, with eight votes compared to six for the
Republicans.
   Two of those Democrats, however _ Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala. _ are from the party's
conservative wing. One of the Republicans, Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., is a moderate.
   In the event of a tug-of-war on the committee, both sides could
be expected to go fishing for crossovers.
   Some conservatives hope Bush will nominate someone with views
calculated to raise the dander of liberals. They say a big fight
would be just the tonic to energize the GOP's conservative
followers around the country in time for fall election campaigns.
   But no committee members are spoiling for a fight at this stage
of the game, especially with several of them up for re-election
themselves.
   Among Democrats running for another term is Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., whose tone was carefully
neutral over the weekend.
   Biden's office released a statement in which he expressed ``hope
that the president will follow the historic practice of consulting
with the Senate before making his choice.''
   Simon said that he expects the politics of the nomination to
become entangled in his race for re-election against Rep. Lynn
Martin, R-Ill.
   ``But here is something that is infinitely more important than
an election,'' Simon said. ``...If the president appoints someone
who is an ideologue, if he appoints a Robert Bork type, then
inevitably there will be fireworks.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Tries to Judge its Own</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Having shown once again that its 535 members
are vulnerable to the same greed and lust that inflict the populace
that elected it, Congress now is proceeding to discipline two of
its own.
   The House is considering a ``reprimand'' for Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. Its ethics committee found that Frank fixed parking tickets
for a homosexual male prostitute _ whom he had hired as a personal
aide with his own money _ and gave misleading information about him
to authorities. A House vote is expected this week.
   The Senate Ethics Committee proposes ``denouncement'' of Sen.
Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., for breaking rules on outside income,
evading disclosure requirements, and improperly accepting free
limousine rides. Senate action is expected within a couple of weeks.
   Despite the different words ``reprimand'' and ``denouncement,''
there's no significant difference between the two chambers'
punishments. Like almost everything else in Congress, a large and
murky vocabulary has evolved to hide the unpleasant choices at hand.
   When a member of Congress misbehaves, House or Senate, there are
only three real options: Do nothing, scold the offender, or throw
him or her out.
   Doing nothing is a popular option. For example, Republican Rep.
Donald E. Lukens has been convicted in his home state of Ohio for
having sex with an underage girl. The House has not disciplined him.
   ``Reprimand'' and ``denouncement'' fall in the middle category.
In each case, the chamber approves a document that then gets
attached to the offender like a scarlet bulls-eye _ to be used in
the next election by his or her opponent.
   Given the impact on their public images, lawmakers are very
sensitive to the wording of such statements.
   Durenberger's aides argue to reporters that a ``denouncement''
is something less than a ``censure,'' which is the term most
commonly used in past Senate cases. It isn't.
   In the House, though, ``censure'' is a small half-step up from
``reprimand,'' the difference being that the offender must actually
attend and stand in the well of the House and hear the Speaker
recite the punishment.
   Tears ran down the face of Rep. Dan Crane, R-Ill., when he was
brought before his colleagues after being censured in the sex
scandal involving a teenage congressional page. He lost his bid for
re-election.
   Both chambers are extremely reluctant to expel a member, usually
reserving that punishment for the voters to dish out.
   That's already happened with Lukens, as he's been defeated in
the Ohio primary. And it happened in the general election two years
ago with Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., the former Banking
Committee chairman who was investigated but never charged by the
ethics committee.
   But if the voters want a tainted lawmaker, they can have him,
and in some cases they have.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., and Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif.,
are examples of House members who have retained their House seats
and considerable power despite being punished. Studds was censured
for sex with a male page and Roybal was reprimanded for his part in
an influence-peddling scandal.
   It's been more than a decade since the House expelled a member,
and the Senate is even more reluctant to expel than the House _ it
hasn't done so in this century.
   It also seems less necessary in the Senate.
   No senator has been re-elected after being censured. And though
the formal punishment may seem light to an outsider, the effect
within the clubby institution is severe.
   Much more so than the House, the Senate functions via personal
relationships and mutual trust earned over the years. A censured
senator becomes a pariah.
   One senior Senate aide recalled when former Sen. Thomas Dodd,
father of the current Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., was censured
for financial misconduct more than two decades ago.
   Asked how a member of ``the club'' could be so punished by his
colleagues, he responded: ``Yes, we have a club in the Senate. And
when a senator misbehaves, we eat him.''
   In Dodd's day, it was a private dinner. Now, with the advent of
C-Span, millions of people will watch in their homes as Congress
tries to judge its own.

<HEAD>Report: Banned Assault Weapons Being Admitted After Modifications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, saying it has no
choice under the law, has approved importation of some previously
banned firearms that were modified to get around the ban, according
to a published report.
   Relying on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act by the Firearms Policy Project, The Washington Post said
permission has been granted to import new versions of the Uzi,
AK-47, Galil, HK-91 and other assault weapons. The importation of
those weapons was prohibited last year.
   The paper, in Monday's editions, quoted officials as saying the
new versions have been altered to remove flash suppressors, grenade
launchers, bayonet attachments and other military-style features
that made them unsuitable for ``sporting purposes.''
   Once the military-style features were removed ``they no longer
fit the category of semiautomatic, assault-type rifle'' and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had no grounds for keeping
them out, the paper quoted BATF spokeswoman Dot Koester as saying.
   However, the guns still can accept magazines of up to 30 rounds
of ammunition and have pistol-grip type stocks that enable them to
be reloaded quickly.
   Josh Sugarman, director of the group that made the documents
available to the Post, was quoted as saying those features make
them every bit as deadly as the banned weapons and ``makes a
mockery of last year's action.''
   Attempts to obtain a home telephone listing Sunday night for Ms.
Koester were unsuccessful and Sugarman's telephone was answered by
an answering machine.

<HEAD>Pepper Commission: Government Should Make Medicare Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan commission says the government
should help the elderly poor pay Medicare charges, add coverage of
preventive services to Medicare and order improvements in
supplementary insurance coverage.
   The $2.8 billion package recommended by the Pepper Commission
would add to a $66 billion plan the panel suggested in March that
would provide health care coverage to nearly all Americans.
   The panel voted 11-4 for the latest three recommendations.
   ``People may think that because the elderly have Medicare they
are adequately protected. That's wrong,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., commission chairman, said in the panel's Sunday
announcement of the action.
   The improvements are ``desperately needed to assure older
Americans the same minimum standard of protection we've already
recommended providing Americans under 65,'' he said.
   The panel, created by Congress in 1988 as the U.S. Bipartisan
Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, includes 12 members of
Congress and three White House appointees. It was later renamed to
honor the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   The commission's larger package of proposals in March was
criticized by some of its own members for failing to recommend
funding.
   In its earlier action, the panel split 8-7 on the plan to
achieve universal access by requiring businesses to provide private
health insurance to their workers or to contribute to a public plan
for employees and non-working dependents.
   At that time, panel members also voted 11-4 for a plan offering
all Americans coverage for long-term care in their homes and for
the first three months in a nursing home.

   A Navy sailor has been accused of raping an
enlisted woman aboard the submarine tender USS Holland, published
reports said today.
   The allegations are the second rape accusations against naval
personnel in three months, The Washington Post reported in its
Monday editions.
   The assault allegedly occurred July 14 in the enlisted women's
quarters aboard the ship while it was docked at its home port in
Charleston, S.C., the paper said, quoting Navy officials.
   The woman has taken a temporary leave from the ship. The
suspect, a petty officer third class is being detained in the naval
brig at Charleston. A magistrate's hearing Friday found enough
evidence to continue the investigation.
   The sailor was not identified, pending the filing of formal
charges against him.
   The allegations came one day before the court-martial in another
case involving the rape of a female officer, allegedly by another
officer, aboard an ammunition supply ship in the Mediterranean.

<HEAD>East German Parliament Gives Governments Decision on Formal Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maziere has averted
the collapse of his broad coalition government with an agreement by
the governing parties to put off a decision on the precise date of
German unification.
   The Social Democrats, East Germany's second-largest party, and
the smaller Liberal centrist alliance had threatened to pull out of
the government over the issue, but reached a compromise on Sunday.
   The parties have demanded that unity occur a day before
elections, set for Dec. 2. In that way, all of Germany, not two
separate nations, would vote at once.
   But de Maiziere's Christian Democrats have said unity before the
vote would place East Germans under a government they did not elect
_ the West German government _ if only for a day.
   The coalition partners agreed to have the two German governments
consult on the issue and try to come up with a solution.
   Lawmakers did resolve a major difference in the election laws of
the two Germanys by establishing the same 5 percent minimum for
party representation as exists in West Germany.
   The law means parties must get at least 5 percent of the vote in
state and local elections to win seats in councils or legislatures.
   The Communists' successor party, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, had pressed for a 3 percent threshold.
   De Maiziere and his Christian Democrat allies in West Germany,
led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have favored allowing East Germans
to hold elections for a united Parliament on the same day as in the
West, but counting the vote separately in areas that are now part
of East Germany.
   This would lower the amount of votes East German parties would
need for representation in the federal Parliament, allowing smaller
parties a chance to get past the 5 percent threshold and win seats.
   It would also help the Christian Democrats, who rely more on
coalitions with smaller parties than the Social Democrats, form a
legislative majority.
   Also Sunday, Parliament voted to reconstitute the country's five
states that had been dissolved under Communist rule 38 years ago.
The move was intended to facilitate East Germany's merger with the
West under terms of Bonn's constitution.
   Lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to make Oct. 14 the date for
elections in the states of Mecklenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt,
Thueringia and Brandenburg, as well as in East Berlin.
   The move restores the five states to roughly their 1946 borders
and abolishes the 14 districts created by the Communists in a 1952
administrative reform program.
   The Parliament also passed its last independent budget. The
$38.8 billion budget will have a deficit of about $20.6 billion,
which will be covered in part by the Bonn government and through
new credit.
   East Germany merged its economy with West Germany on July 1.
Experts have predicted that up to half its 8 million workers could
lose their jobs as formerly state-supported industries lose to free
market competition.

<TEXT>
   J.C. Franklin gambled and
lost when he moved three years ago into this flood-prone community
on the banks of the unpredictable Brazos River.
   As he and other people in southern Parker County, just west of
Fort Worth, recover from some of the worst spring flooding in north
Texas this century, the dice keep coming up snake eyes.
   ``It's wiped us out financially. I thought about suicide,''
Franklin said as he stood in the doorway of his $42,000 home that
was flooded for nine days in late April. ``I have a pretty good
job, my wife's got a pretty good job ... but we're financially
ruined. We don't have enough money to buy our supper.''
   Franklin, a 51-year-old truck driver, spends his weekends
cleaning up and repairing what he can. He hopes to sell the house
and move to nearby Weatherford.
   He takes a well-trodden path through the home, stopping to sigh
at a rusted $2,200 antique stove before surveying the dirt-covered
walls of a family room added to the home recently.
   ``We never got a chance to sit in (the family room),'' he said.
``Never had a chance, not once, to sit in there.''
   Like the Franklins, thousands of families in the hardest-hit
north and north central Texas counties of Liberty, Bowie, Brown and
Dallas watched the rain-swollen Brazos, Trinity and Red rivers wash
away their homes, mementoes and chunks of their lives.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has received more than
6,000 disaster assistance applications from 68 Texas counties in
the wake of storms between April 15 and June 4 that claimed 15
lives and caused millions of dollars in damage.
   About 200 Parker County families also took advantage of FEMA's
temporary housing program, which provides money for disaster
victims to rent housing for up to 18 months, said Graham Nance of
FEMA's disaster aid office.
   Parker County officials are now working with FEMA on how to meet
federal regulations that would make county residents eligible for
the federal flood insurance program. Counties must belong to the
program before its residents can qualify for rebuilding loans from
FEMA, Nance said.
   Several families in Horseshoe Bend and the Dallas neighborhood
of Rochester Park had no flood insurance.
   Families in Rochester Park, which has flooded for two years
straight, got a boost last week when the city announced it would be
able to build an $8.9 million flood levee by November 1991, two
years ahead of original estimates.
   The good news hasn't come often, though. Billie Farrington, a
Horseshoe Bend bartender, says she has ``no big bank account,'' and
now lives from paycheck to paycheck with friends, with no immediate
plans for the future.
   Insects fly freely through the broken windows of her home and
many of the abandoned trailer homes along Horseshoe Bend's Comanche
Trail. A discolored, dirty line along the wall is a reminder of the
5 feet of water that stood in the trailer for more than a week.
   Piles of wood, mud-caked furniture and clothing still litter
some lawns, even though the community has held two weekend cleanups.
   But at least 20 residents, including the Franklins, in this
community of 400 say it's time to clean up and clear out.
   ``I'd just as soon do anything than to have to leave this
place,'' Franklin said. ``But we can't afford it. Every time I turn
around that damn water's coming up, and you have to take off from
work to watch the water so you can evacuate. I just can't do it.''
   Though she lost everything, Ms. Farrington says she's staying
put.
   ``It's home. You've got roots,'' she said. ``This is where I
want to live till I die.''

<HEAD>Mississippi Has New Education Reform Package _ But No Funding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GINA HOLLAND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi, long the last on most
education yardsticks, has a school reform package that lawmakers
hope will change all that. But finding money for it hasn't been as
easy as A-B-C.
   The package is designed to reduce adult illiteracy and teen-age
pregnancy and lower the number of dropouts. But its price tag is
$182 million over three years.
   And the prospect of coming up with the money, even the $45
million needed in the first year, is bleak. Especially with
statewide elections coming up next year.
   Gov. Ray Mabus won't go along with a tax increase and
legislators have balked at a package of fee increases and a
proposal to let voters decide whether the state should start a
lottery.
   ``Mississippi is clearly leading the pack in terms of ideas,''
Mabus said. ``We have passed the best education reform act in the
country. We just need to go ahead and finish the job.''
   Mabus won election in 1987 on a pledge that Mississippi would
``never be last again.'' He has a big job ahead of him.
   More than 400,000 of the state's 2.5 million residents are
illiterate. The dropout rate is 37 percent, giving Mississippi one
of the five highest rates in the nation. Mississippi students have
the lowest average scores in the nation on the ACT, the college
entrance exam. Mississippi ranks last in spending per student.
   In April, Mabus signed into law his BEST package, short for
Better Education for Success Tomorrow. The legislation continued
reforms begun in 1982 that have helped raise test scores and
increase accountability by requiring district ``report cards.''
   Last month, the govenor called the Legislature into special
session to find money for the new reforms, which include curriculum
improvements and bonds to replace aging buildings and buses.
   Proposals to let voters decide if Mississippi should have a
lottery passed the House but failed by five votes in the Senate
during the 13-day special session, which cost nearly $357,000.
   Now, the Democratic governor must decide whether to call another
special session of the Democratic-controlled Legislature or wait
until January's regular session to try to find funding for BEST.
   ``We're disappointed,'' said Andy Mullins, spokesman for the
state Department of Education. ``This was the best shot that we've
had at getting these programs that are controversial passed in a
long time.''
   Privately, some legislators say Mabus put them on the spot just
before an election year.
   ``You'd have to ask them if it's me,'' Mabus said. ``Tell me how
sad is it and how terrible is it if you want to punish children
because you happen to dislike a particular individual. We ought to
be better than that.''
   Jim Simpson, chairman of the House Education Committee, is
looking to Mabus for a little flexibility.
   ``If the Legislature funds it, I think it will be with a
broad-based tax increase mutually acceptable to the House and
Senate,'' he said.

   At least 10,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians
gathered in a lakefront park for a Divine Liturgy celebrated by
their highest spiritual leader, the Archbishop of Constantinople.
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I looked tired but smiled and
waved as he alighted from a limousine Sunday morning to begin a
two-hour outdoor liturgy at the Petrillo Band Shell in Grant Park.
   The service was the first event in a three-day Chicago stay by
the world leader of 180 million to 250 million followers of Eastern
Orthodoxy. His 27-day tour of the United States, which concludes
Sunday in Boston, is the first visit to this continent by anyone in
his office.
   ``He's like our pope. ... He's the head person in our religion
and it's a big religious event for us,'' said Frances Halikias, 54,
a Greek Orthodox Christian from suburban Palos Hills.
   A steady early morning rain failed to dampen the spirits of
those who traveled from all over the Midwest to see the man they
consider ``first among equals'' in their faith.
   Christian Orthodoxy is largely divided along national lines,
including Greeks, Russians, Albanians, Serbians, Ukrainians and
others.
   ``For him to come to us is just magnificent,'' said the Rev.
James S. Gordon, a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox Diocese of
Chicago. ``It's a thrill for everybody here.''
   The amphitheater where the service was held is located in a park
between skyscrapers and Lake Michigan. Worshipers made the sign of
the cross as the 75-year-old archbishop strode from his car to the
red and gold-carpeted stage.
   There, amid six painted icons, an altar covered with consecrated
relics and an ornate pulpit and bishop's throne brought from
Greece, Dimitrios led the liturgy, including reading a brief homily
in Greek, which was translated into English as he went.
   The homily marked a commemoration of Mary Madgalene and the
women mourners at Christ's tomb that is part of the Eastern
Orthodox liturgical calendar for this Sunday, Gordon said.
   After the homily, communion was offered by 30 priests to all
Orthodox Christians who wanted it.
   The patriarch did not make any remarks about his visit during
the service. But Gordon said he was sure the patriarch had to be
impressed by the number of worshipers who had come o see him.
   ``There are only 2,000 Orthodox communicants in Constantinople
(modern-day Istanbul, Turkey) now. So when he sees easily 7,000 or
8,000 people _ it could be 10,000 by now _ this has got to blow him
away,'' Gordon said.
   The service was the largest ever held for Orthodox Christians in
the United States, according to Jim Peponis, organizer of the
liturgy for the Chicago Greek Orthodox Diocese. He estimated the
crowd at 10,000 to 12,000.
   Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism split almost 1,000 years
ago over differences in belief about the origin of the Holy Spirit
and over the Roman pope's claim of authority over the eastern
church. The two churches still hold similar beliefs on most points,
however.
   Six million followers of Eastern Orthodoxy live in the United
States, including about 250,000 in Chicago and its suburbs.

<HEAD>Peres Defeats Rabin in Labor Party Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres has won
a major political victory over rival Yitzhak Rabin, who attempted
to force immediate elections for party chief.
   ``I fell in love with my party again,'' Peres said Sunday after
he won a battle in the party's policy-making body to postpone until
next year a vote on the party chairman post.
   ``The party and the country shall benefit from this victory,''
he said.
   Labor's 1,400-member central committee was called into session
to consider demands by Rabin, Labor's No. 2 man, for a vote soon on
the chairman post.
   According to official results, about 54 percent of the 1,212
Labor members present supported Peres and decided to postpone the
election.
   Peres, a former prime minister, had argued that the center-left
party should prepare for a battle with the rival Likud bloc and
deal with internal struggles later.
   Just before official results of the vote were announced at the
end of the seven-hour meeting, dancing and singing supporters
surrounded Peres, and many kissed and hugged him.
   Rabin has been maneuvering to oust Peres since May, when Peres
failed to form a Labor-led government after bringing down a shaky
coalition with Likud.
   The failure enabled Likud leader Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to form his right-wing Cabinet in early June.
   ``I accept the majority decision,'' Rabin said after the vote.
``I thank the great number of central committee members who saw the
need for a change, but the majority decides. I believe that from
now on, the party should be united ... and organize itself as an
opposition confronting Likud.''
   Peres and Rabin then briefly shook hands.
   Peres, who has been party chief since 1977, said later that he
would not seek revenge.
   ``There is room for everyone, for Yitzhak Rabin and others,'' he
said on an interview on Israel radio.
   Although Rabin and Peres both appealed for party unity,
observers predicted that Labor will remain split and unable to
present a strong opposition.
   ``We will see two organized and hostile camps, with leaders who
hardly speak with each other ... a kind of prolonged war of
attrition,'' said Israel radio's political observer, Hanan Cristal.
``Likud may forget about opposition; it will have an easy life in
the government.''
   Mordechai Gur, a senior Labor member and a Rabin supporter, said
Peres' victory had ``weakened the party.''
   ``We thought we should change the leadership to lead a strong,
active opposition. With Peres it would be very difficult. We shall
do our best, but I'm afraid it would not be as strong as it could
have been,'' Gur said.
   Recent polls have consistantly indicated that Rabin, 68, is
Israel's most popular leader.
   Also a former prime minister, he gained popularity for his tough
stance as defense minister in the last government in dealing with
the 31-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.
   He also is remembered as chief of staff in the 1967 Middle East
war when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza
Strip from Egypt.
   By contrast, the popularity of the Polish-born Peres, who turns
67 in 10 days, has been on the decline.

<HEAD>Says Instruments Used to Create Hubble Mirrors Possibly Were
Faulty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some scientists suspect the measuring
instruments made and used by a Connecticut company to create the
Hubble Space Telescope's two mirrors were faulty or improperly
used, a newspaper reported.
   The Hartford Courant said several scientists familiar with the
Hubble project are focusing on the optical devices used to guide
the grinding and polishing of the mirrors as the root of the
focusing problems.
   Because of the mirror problem, the $1.5 billion orbiting
observatory cannot properly focus the light from distant stars as
it orbits 380 miles above the Earth. About half of its astronomical
research must be delayed until a solution is found.
   The mirrors, a 94.5-inch primary mirror and a 12.5-inch
secondary mirror, were made by Perkin-Elmer Corp. at its Danbury
division, which it sold last year to Hughes Aircraft Co.
   Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc. officials agree there is a
problem with one mirror, but are not convinced the company is
responsible, said Hughes spokesman Thomas J. Arconti.
   ``From day one, people have been attempting to lay blame,''
Arconti said. ``That is just much too early.''
   The instruments, which are called null correctors, also were
used to test the finished mirrors on the Hubble.
   Daniel Schulte of Lockheed's Palo Alto (Calif.) Research Labs, a
member of a NASA committee assigned to find ways to correct the
Hubble's focusing problem, told the newspaper he is certain there
was something wrong with a null corrector.
   Schulte said other committee members support his theory. The
Courant said other scientists, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
also agreed the problem was in the null correctors.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other
scientists believe the Hubble's flaw is most likely in the larger
mirror.
   Schulte said he has ruled out the possibility of a problem with
the design of the null corrector for the primary mirror, and
concluded the problem had to be in the manufacture or assembly of
the null corrector.
   ``If the null corrector is correct, the mirror would be
correct,'' said Daniel Schroeder, a NASA telescope scientist who
helped oversee the Hubble project and is chairman of the physics
and astronomy department at Beloit College in Wisconsin.
   Abe Offner, a retired scientist who designed the null system in
the 1970s for Perkin-Elmer, said it was almost certain the null
corrector was flawed.
   Offner is among several scientists due to meet Wednesday and
Thursday in Danbury with a six-member NASA team investigating the
Hubble's flaw. There are other possibilities to explain problems
with the telescope, but ``they are kind of far-fetched,'' he said.
   Investigators have not yet tested the null correctors, the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>A Boycott Grows in Brooklyn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bong Jae Jang rises before dawn and goes to the
Brooklyn Terminal Market, where he stocks up on green plantain,
Haitian mangos and other produce popular with the Caribbean
immigrants who used to shop at his store.
   These days, Jang's trip is an academic exercise; he knows most
of the fruits and vegetables will sit unsold on the shelf, rot in
the July heat and wind up in the trash bin outside.
   ``Who's going to buy this?'' he asks, holding up a
cellophane-wrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies.
   After six months, a black-led boycott of Jang's greengrocery
continues, even though the television cameras are gone and the
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have
dwindled to a handful.
   The boycotters' avowed aim is to force the store to close.
   Jang's business is sustained largely by $5,000 to $7,000 a month
in donations from the city's other Korean grocers. ``They will
support him until the boycott is over,'' says Michael Kang of the
Korean Produce Association. ``He is their Maginot Line. They think
they're going to be next.''
   Jang's troubles began Jan. 18, when Giselaine Felissaint, a
Haitian immigrant, got into an argument with several of his
employees over some merchandise. One of them touched her. She says
the man knocked her down; another employee says the man put his
hands on her and she laid down.
   It would be five months before the manager of the store, Pong Ok
Jang, was charged with assault, but the incident immediately became
a symbol of the tensions between the city's black and Korean
communities.
   Within a few months, hundreds of demonstrators were gathering
outside the store each day, along with almost as many police and
journalists. Pickets yelled racial slurs at the Koreans and urged
them to ``go back to where you came from.''
   The problem went far beyond a simple assault charge. Many blacks
resent the way they are treated in some of the Korean grocery
stores that have opened in their communities, and some are jealous
of the immigrants' business success. The self-employed account for
6.7 percent of all city workers, but only 3.4 percent of black ones.
   Skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would
end as soon as the last camera crew departed; they were wrong. By 5
p.m. there are usually about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store in the
Flatbush neighborhood. Few local residents defy their cries of
``Boycott!''
   ``The stores have become a symbol of what has happened across
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black
people,'' says George Dames, a spokesman for the Flatbush Coalition
for Economic Empowerment, a boycott group. ``It was not an isolated
incident.''
   Since May, however, ``tensions there have been lessening, if not
dramatically, then incrementally,'' says Lonnie Soury, spokesman
for the city's Human Rights Commission.
   Mayor David Dinkins has appointed a fact-finding panel and
called for an end to the boycott, but none seems likely soon. There
still have been no direct negotiations between the Korean and
Haitian communities, let alone Jang and Mrs. Felissaint. She has
refused to denounce the boycott and has filed a $6 million suit
against the store.
   According to a poll taken last month, only 13 percent of New
Yorkers support the boycott, while 58 percent support the Koreans.
Among blacks, only 27 percent sympathize with the boycotters, while
37 percent side with the Koreans. Boycott leaders say this simply
reflects biased news coverage.
   Jang, 35, says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at
another store before opening his own. He says that before the
boycott he routinely worked 17 hours a day, and was robbed three
times. He shows off the scar where a robber's bullet entered his
abdomen last year.
   Jang says neither Dinkins nor Police Commissioner Lee Brown
wants to stand up to the boycotters, and pass responsibility for
dealing with them back and forth. He does not speak English very
clearly, but he gets his point across: ``They play a ping-pong
game. They killing my dream.''
   To Soury, the boycott is a tragedy. ``Two immigrant groups are
pitted against each other, when they should be fighting together to
demand more government aid for small businesses _ for blacks and
Koreans and everyone else.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Spin Off from Sluggish Cold Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A sluggish cold front out of Texas created ideal thunderstorm
conditions today.
   An upper level weather disturbance also produced showers and a
few thunderstorms, mainly over the upper Mississippi Valley and
western sections of the Great Lakes region.
   Rain was widely scattered across the Rocky Mountain region.
   The cold front was slowly pushing across southwest and north
central Texas. Showers and thunderstorms extended from southwest
Texas to Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms ranged along the middle Atlantic Coast and through
western New England. Rain was developing in eastern sections of the
Ohio Valley.
   Heavy storms in Ohio on Sunday spawned at least three tornadoes
and thundershowers that soaked already saturated ground, leaving
much of eastern Ohio under a flood watch, authorities said.
   Tornadoes were reported in Niles and near East Palestine in
northeast Ohio, and near Marietta in southeast Ohio, but there were
no reports of injuries and damage appeared to be minor, sheriffs'
officials said.
   Temperatures in the West on Sunday soared above 100 degrees as
far north as Washington state. Pasco, Wash., recorded 111 degrees.
Borrego Springs, Calif., was 115 degrees and Death Valley, Calif.,
had an afternoon high of 119 degrees.

<HEAD>Mongolians Await Results of First Multi-Party Election Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in Mongola began tabulating results
today of the first multiparty elections ever held in the world's
second-oldest Communist state after the Soviet Union.
   Voters turned out across the Asian nation's 600,000 square miles
of grasslands and steppe on Sunday for a primary involving 2,400
candidates for the national legislature, or Great People's Hural.
   The balloting was to reduce the field to 860 candidates, two for
every seat in the Hural. The runoff is scheduled for next Sunday.
   A source in the capital, Ulan Bator, visited 10 polling stations
in the city and described the voting as ``very well organized.''
   ``The voters appeared to have a lot of confidence in the voting.
They seemed enthusiastic about having a choice this time,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said results would be announced at a news conference tonight.
   Sunday's elections made Mongolia the latest Soviet-bloc nation
to move toward multiparty democracy following a huge outpouring of
pro-democracy sentiment during street demonstrations last winter.
   Mongolians were given the choice of voting for candidates from
the ruling Communist party, known as the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party, or from one of five new opposition parties.
   The opposition parties were formed following weeks of rallies
for reform that forced former president and Communist party chief
Jambyn Batmonh from power last spring.
   The Communists, known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party, and the opposition parties all say their next step will be
market-style economic reforms.
   Only 300 of the candidates in the primary are members of the
non-communist parties. Together they have 15,000 members, compared
with the Communist party's 90,000.
   The ruling party is almost certain to win a majority in the
430-seat Great People's Hural because one seat is being allocated
for every 2,000 rural residents, compared with one seat per 10,000
urban residents.
   Most of the support for the non-communist parties is among
educated urban residents, but the Communists remain strong in rural
areas.
   The opposition parties, however, hope to win a strong majority
in the 53-seat Small Hural, which was newly created to replace the
current standing committee of the Great People's Hural.
   The Small Hural will meet year-round and hold most governmental
power. However, the Great Hural still will elect a new president.
The incumbent, Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, was elected by the outgoing
Great Hural in April.
   The Small Hural originally was to have been elected by the Great
Hural. But, under pressure from the opposition, the government
agreed to allocate Small Hural seats according to the percentage of
votes each party receives.
   The Communists made more concessions last month after the
opposition parties threatened to pull out of the election.
   The ruling party agreed to allow opposition participation in
local election commissions, which count ballots, and to allow
international observers to monitor the election. The Communists
also gave each party state funds for campaigning and suspended
party cells in the army and state security forces during the
campaign and balloting.
   Foreign observers in Ulan Bator include a team of British
parliamentarians.
   Mongolia has been ruled by the Communists since 1921, when a
small band of revolutionaries aided by Soviet troops drove out the
Chinese who had controlled Mongolia since 1691. China retained
southern Mongolia, called Inner Mongolia, where Mongolian tribal
princes had formed alliances with the Chinese.

<HEAD>Government Confirms Fierce Fighting In Central Province</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government today reported fierce fighting in a mountainous central
province that it said Khmer Rouge guerrillas were trying to seize.
   ``The enemy is attempting by all means to seize control'' of
Kompong Thom, the official SPK news agency quoted the chief
provincial administrator, Khieu Horl, as saying.
   Khieu Horl showed heaps of firearms, ammunition and other
materiel recently captured from the guerrillas, said the report,
who was monitored in Bangkok. He said about 800 Khmer Rouge
guerrillas struck from all directions on June 17, but were repulsed
in fighting that killed 112 guerrillas.
   Government Col. Hang Thol was quoted as saying the guerrillas
have intensified attacks since a last month's agreement in Tokyo to
arrange a truce, ``and have played havoc with any place they
infiltrated into.''
   The Khmer Rouge did not sign the Tokyo agreement.
   The SPK report said the Khmer Rouge infiltrated through the many
rivers crossing the province.
   Claims of military successes by the government and the Khmer
Rouge, both communist, are treated with skepticism. But other
sources have confirmed heavy fighting in Kompong Thom, which
previously was largely spared in the 11-year-old war as fighting
focused on western areas bordering Thailand.
   The Khmer Rouge and non-communist guerrillas loyal to Prince
Norodom Sihanouk have seized wide areas of the province in recent
months. Sihanouk's fighters also briefly penetrated the provincial
capital, also called Kompong Thom, said an Associated Press
correspondent who visited the area.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said Saturday it was preparing a new
attack on the provincial capital, about 75 miles north of Phnom
Penh.
   It said that on July 12 and 13, 537 of its civilian supporters _
including youths _ voluntarily portered weapons, ammunition and
food to guerrillas readying for the attack.
   The Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people
when in power in the 1970s, is allied in a guerrilla coalition with
the forces of Sihanouk and of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front. Vietnam installed the current government in Phnom
Penh after invading in late 1978.
   A U.S. policy shift announced Wednesday has increased fears that
the Khmer Rouge will escalate the fighting because of its
international isolation. The United States, citing its opposition
to the Khmer Rouge, said it was withdrawing recognition of the
coalition's seat at the United Nations in order to open talks with
Vietnam on ending the Cambodian war.
   The SPK agency on Saturday urged the Khmer Rouge and its main
source of arms, China, to return to talks on arranging the
cease-fire.
   Sihanouk and Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen signed on June
5 in Tokyo the agreement calling for a truce, but the Khmer Rouge
boycotted the talks after complaining it was not being treated as
an equal.
   China later said it did not support the agreement.

   The dismemberment of an environmentalist
soliciting donations in a rural neighborhood has raised concerns
about the safety of canvassers nationwide.
   James Michael Madden, 24, of Whitefish Bay was last seen June 27
going door to door in rural Racine County to enlist support and
solicit funds for Citizens for a Better Environment.
   On June 29, his remains, minus the head and arms, were found in
plastic bags by a farmhand near a road. The missing body parts were
found last week about five miles from where the torso was
discovered.
   No arrests have been made and the investigation is continuing.
Detectives say they believe Madden met a psychotic killer and his
death was not related to the political slant of his work.
   But groups that hire canvassers say the slaying has raised
interest in improving safety precautions, including self-defense
training, for their thousands of employees.
   ``It happened once and it could happen again,'' said Gordon
White, canvass director for the environmental group Greenpeace's
New York chapter. ``We want to play it safe and be prepared given
the possibility something like this might reoccur.''
   White's office is one of 29 Greenpeace offices nationwide that
employ up to 1,000 canvassers during the summer. Many are college
students looking for summer jobs.
   White, who coordinates 50 canvassers in the New York City area,
said his office is scheduling a series of safety courses involving
self-defense and non-violent training.
   ``Because of the heightened awareness, we wanted to take care of
the concerns about safety,'' he said.
   Some canvassers say such efforts should become routine.
   ``You go canvassing, you go into a different neighborhood, meet
50 to 150 people you have never met in your life and will probably
never see again, then you're going to have a greater likelihood of
running into these nuts,'' said former canvasser Tom Oates, 32, of
Washington, D.C.

   The dollar fell against European currencies this
morning but gained against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices were up marginally.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.50 yen, up 0.15 yen from
Friday's finish. Later in London, the dollar firmed to 148.84 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6369 West German marks, down from 1.6410
   _1.3985 Swiss francs, down from 1.4070
   _5.4900 French francs, down from 5.5045
   _1,198.50 Italian lire, down from 1,201.75
   _1.1552 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1565
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8188 from $1.8140 late
Friday.
   The rate for the Dutch guilder was not available.
   The dollar was lower in the morning in Tokyo but advanced in the
afternoon session. Investors flocked to the dollar after the Nikkei
index shed nearly 600 points at one point, said Minori Takeuchi, a
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Due to a lack of fresh market news, however, there's no sign
for any big movements,'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Currency dealers were expecting a further drop in the dollar's
value because preliminary figures for second-quarter U.S. economic
growth, to be released Friday, were expected to show a decline,
said Chiyuki Watanabe of Sanwa Bank.
   Gold was quoted in London at $361.80 per troy ounce at this
morning's fixing, up from $361.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to $361.90, from $361.50 bid late Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 11 cents an ounce today, to close at
$362.28.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid price of $4.86 a troy
ounce, down from $4.87 bid late Friday.

   Rosie Jones, a 26-year-old computer

   Jones was selected from among 39 contestants in the 22nd annual
pageant. A native of St. Louis, she lives and works in Bridgeport,
Conn.
   Jacklynne Ann Fletcher of Dayton, Ohio, was second; Elaine
Joyner of Columbia, S.C., was third; and Cynthia Richardson of
Cincinnati was fourth.
   The pageant included swimsuit, public speaking and talent
competitions.
   The outgoing Miss Black America, Paula Gwynn, 23, of Washington,
D.C., said Jones must become a voice for blacks.
   ``She has to reach from black America to others to say `this is
what black America is about,''' Gwynn said.
   Jones will receive a $2,000 minimum cash prize, a trip to
Hawaii, new clothes and a crown. She will make appearances across
the United States during her reign.
   Unlike the Miss America pageant, the contestants were from major
metropolitan areas across the United States rather than from each
state, said Aleta Anderson, a producer and the daughter of the
pageant's founder, J. Morris Anderson.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shorter skirts than ever and plenty of lush fabrics
appear to be the main themes for next winter's lines of haute
couture.
   Christian Lacroix opened a week of fashion shows Sunday with a
stunning display of exotica and opulent fabrics, refining his line
with some superb jackets and trapeze coats, fur-trimmed velvet and
gilded brocade.
   A gold-shot raspberry tweed suit with bold rhinestone buttons
seemed to please Ivana Trump, who is staying at the famed Ritz
hotel. She beamed througout Lacroix's show.
   Like the other main houses, Lacroix is ready to lengthen the
short styles on the runway for a rich client who decides $10,000 is
too much for a bathing-suit length cocktail dress.
   The cheery designer from southern France looked somewhat pale as
he took a bow to enthusiastic applause. But after two back
operations several months ago, and a lawsuit brought by his former
employer Patou, he says he's still in fine shape.
   The Lacroix exuberance occasionally flounces out in too many
details, such as layer on layer of lace, or yet another bustle, but
most of his fitted clothes were splendid.
   So were the adornments _ sparkly buttons, sable cuffs, detailed
embroidery and heavy-metal jeweling straight from Byzantium. Even
boots were jeweled, giving the slightly 1960s silhouettes new
lavishness.
   ``I get my inspiration from all over,'' said Lacroix.
   Another dream world for rich fashion devotees was turned out by
Hanae Mori. The Japanese couturiere, who won the Legion of Honor
last year, also is the only Japanese officially accepted as a
member of the French haute couture group, the Chambre Syndicale.
   Mori was awarded a delicate white rose in her name at the Parc
de Bagatelle a few weeks ago. The French have honored many famous
women, including Barbara Bush, by naming a rose after them.
   At her show, Mori concentrated on exquisite drapes and flowers
as a theme for her dressier clothes. Her rose-fastened satin gowns
with draping and sparkling embroidery were luscious for debutantes
or women a bit older.
   Mori did some wonderful short suits in smooth wools,
easily-fitted with flaring long peplum jackets, and luxuriant short
cashmere or smooth-wool capes in colors raspberry or mustard.
   But her show-stoppers were the slithery sequined gowns
embroidered to look like Van Gogh paintings, with all the swirls
and cypresses right out of the Arles masterpieces.
   Meanwhile, Italian Gianni Versace threw a splashy party in the
Ritz gardens Saturday night following his show. The guest of honor
was Sylvester Stallone.
   The big idea was an array of print mixes and sparkly embroidery
_ in the shortest outfits possible.
   His dots, checks and 1960s-style graphics for the sheer fun of
it drew kudos. And he showed some new pleated and draped looks he
says were inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's paintings.
   Among the sprouting new talent, Dutch-born Paul B. Elsen, 27,
gave a promising offering of truly couture-finished styles. He
reportedly sewed all 32 garments himself.
   His long fitted redingote-style jackets with their jaunty
riders' top hats were well made, as were some of the terrific pants
suits, often with an interesting bolero flared with sharp pleats at
the back.
   To amuse the jaded fashion crowd and launch a new watch
collection called ``Mademoiselle,'' the Chanel company is opening
up the Chanel suite at the Ritz for the week. The rooms are
reconstituted exactly as when Coco Chanel lived there before World
War II.

   A student and a bricklayer who claimed to have

   ``There were no bombs, no weapons, nothing,'' Mikhail Timofeyev,
the deputy minister of civil aviation, said by telephone.
   The two tried to hijack an Aeroflot Tupolev-134 with 74
passengers that was en route to the arctic port of Murmansk from
the Latvian capital of Riga, Timofeyev said.
   ``Following consultations with ground security services, the
crew decided, however, to land at Petrozavodsk,'' 150 miles north
of Leningrad, Tass said.
   Security officials arrested the two passengers, who were
identified by the official Soviet news agency only as Kovalenko,
22, a vocational training student, and Kuznetsov, a 27-year-old
bricklayer.
   Five young Soviet men hijacked five airliners to Sweden and
Finland in June and July. They surrendered to police and said they
wanted to stay in the Nordic countries.
   Sweden extradited one hijacker to the Soviet Union last week and
Swedish officials said it was a warning to potential hijackers that
they could not expect to stay in Sweden.
   Soviet extradition requests for the other four hijackers are
being considered.

   Shiite Moslem factions rushed
reinforcements to an embattled mountaintop town in southern Lebanon
today, and thousands of villagers trekked out of the region fearing
escalated warfare.
   Police observed a marked decrease of fighting after eight days
of ferocious battles between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal militia around the hilltop town
of Jarjou.
   They said one combatant was killed and two other Amal militiamen
wounded in sporadic exchanges of artillery and sniper fire near
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' inside Lebanon.
   Police said the dead fighter was a Syrian belonging to the
Damascus-based Baath Party fighting with Amal.
   The Monday casualties raised the toll to 126 people killed and
369 wounded since the latest round in the intermittant, three-year
Amal-Hezbollah confrontation broke out July 16.
   By police count, at least 1,167 people have been killed and
4,011 wounded in the power struggle for control of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Palestinian guerrillas, stationed between Amal and Hezbollah in
the disputed region, took up four new hilltop positions west of
Jarjou on Sunday.
   ``The Palestinian force is now capable of preventing any advance
from either side,'' said Lt. Col. Anwar Madi, commander of the PLO
intervention force, as he checked on his guerrillas at Jarjou today.
   Police said dozens of truckloads of ammunition and jeeps
carrying Amal militiamen were sent to the militia's positions
around Jarjou during the night. Amal has fielded about 6,500
frontline fighters.
   They said Hezbollah set up several additional artillery and
mortar batteries in Jarjou. The fundamentalist group has an
estimated 2,000-strong force in the Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple
Province.
   The arrival of reinforcements panicked the region's remaining
inhabitants.
   Long lines of fleeing villagers trudged through the rugged hills
of the province, carrying household necessities under their arms
and on their heads.
   Most of them sought refuge in southern Lebanon's major cities of
Sidon, Tyre and Nabatiyeh.
   Others fled to open fields, sleeping at night in cars.
   ``Jarjou is almost completely deserted with a few people and
many Hezbollah fighters there,'' said one refugee, who spoke on
condition his name not be published.
   ``The town has been turned into a pile of debris,'' he said.
   Police estimated that no more than 50 elderly people of Jarjou's
original 5,000 inhabitants remained in the town.
   About 50,000 people fled the Apple Province since the clashes
broke out last week. Hezbollah appealed to the International
Committee of the Red Cross to remove corpses decomposing under a
blazing sun in Jarjou and pledged to facilitate the humanitarian
mission.
   The fighting erupted last Monday when Hezbollah attacked and
seized Jarjou, an Amal stronghold, seeking to expand its area of
control as far as the Mediterranean coast to open a badly needed
supply line.
   A 600-member Palestinian force, drawn mainly from PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah group, was deployed Tuesday along
a 7-mile-long line, ostensibly to stop the fighting.
   Amal militiamen, supported by the Palestinians, retook Jarjou in
ferocious battles on Saturday. But the fundamentalists drove the
more secular Amal out of town to the western entrance of Jarjou in
close-quarter combat Sunday.
   The PLO fears if Hezbollah expands from Jarjou to the
Mediterranean they might link up with anti-Arafat Palestinian
radicals and threaten the PLO bases in refugee camps near the port
of Sidon, 10 miles northwest of Jarjou.

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong aftershocks rocked this
mountain city today, sending residents fleeing into the streets and
hampering the search for victims of last week's earthquake. The
death toll surpassed 1,000.
   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino urged Congress to approve a
$500 million relief package to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by
last Monday's quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   Mrs. Aquino made the call in a 55-minute state of the nation
speech that television commentators said was surprisingly
lackluster.
   Also today, Rep. Rolando Andaya, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said he would pursue proposals to suspend
debt payments for two years to free funds to rebuild.
   Mrs. Aquino has warned that any unilateral reduction in debt
payments could worsen the country's economic plight by prompting
international lenders to reduce the flow of new money.
   In Baguio, the search for survivors shifted to the task of
recovering the dead. British and other foreign experts declared
there were no signs of life in any of the nearly 30 buildings
devastated by the temblor.
   Official figures put the death toll at 1,055, but it was
expected to rise.
   More than 200 bodies are believed still buried in rubble.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, chairman of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council, said more than 3,000 people were severely
injured in the quake and more than 700 were missing. Ramos said
nearly 90,000 people were homeless.
   British volunteers abandoned the search for survivors after
failing to find signs of life in the Hyatt Hotel, the last area of
Baguio where experts believed there might still be survivors of the
quake.
   Hopes that some people were still alive at the Hyatt faded after
rescuers no longer heard tapping sounds on walls near the hotel
basement. Rescuers said the last of the survivors probably died
after aftershocks shifted the rubble, either crushing them or
depriving them of air.
   More aftershocks jolted Baguio today, including one about 9:45
a.m. that sent hundreds of people fleeing into the streets. Many
Baguio residents have been sleeping outdoors since the quake
because of continuing aftershocks.
   On Sunday, one of Mrs. Aquino's Cabinet members acknowledged
that his construction firm built the Baguio Hyatt 15 years ago, but
he refused to comment on allegations by a prominent civil engineer
that the building was structurally unsound.
   ``There are many factors to consider before you can pinpoint
where the fault lies,'' said Fiorello Estuar, secretary of the
Department of Public Works and Highways.
   Last week, Octavio Kalalo, former president of the Association
of Structural Engineers of the Philippines, said he inspected the
Hyatt in 1985 and warned that the building could suffer serious
damage in an earthquake because it was structurally unsound. But he
said the warning went unheeded.
   In Manila, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said he would
launch an investigation into possible criminal liability of
builders and owners of buildings that collapsed here and in
Cabanatuan during the quake.
   Jose de Jesus, presidential relief coordinator, said 373 people
were killed in Baguio alone and another 175 in the surrounding
province of Benguet.
   He said 135 people were believed trapped inside eight factories
in Baguio but all were believed dead.
   De Jesus said information on deaths and damage was still
trickling in from remote areas, including Nueva Vizcaya province,
where many villages and roads were buried by landslides.
   Philippine pilots who surveyed the areas saw masses of survivors
walking over the mountains to safety. The pilots described them as
looking like ``columns of ants'' silhouetted against the barren
mountain slopes.

<HEAD>Illinois Signs Sister State Agreement with Russian Federation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's biggest republic and the state
of Illinois today signed a ``sister-state'' agreement, the first
formal agreement of cooperation between an American state and a
Soviet republic.
   The agreement with the Russian Federation was proposed by
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson in April 1989 when he was in Moscow
to open a trade show.
   ``This agreement establishes a formal governmental relationship
and a framework for a wide range of cultural, educational,
technological and economic cooperation programs,'' Thompson said at
signing ceremony.
   Ivan Silayev, chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers,
signed for the republic.
   ``Our efforts to improve trade relations between Illinois and
the Soviet Union have already given birth to several positive
results,'' Thompson said.
   ``We have welcomed numerous Soviet delegations to our state.
There have been several days of discussions in Chicago between the
Ilinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs and the
U.S.S.R. Association for Small and Medium Businesses.''
   The agreement calls for business, farming and cultural
exchanges, including film festivals in Chicago and Moscow.
   Forty-nine Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Illinois,
according to officials traveling with the Republican governor. Many
of them are already doing business in the Soviet Union, including
McDonald's, Abbott Laboratories, Caterpilar and Dresser Industries.
   ``It is the heartfelt desire of the people, businesses,
organized labor and the government of Illinois to establish
permanent and cooperative relationships throughout Russia, for the
mutual benefit of both our people and for an expanding peace and
prosperity for the world,'' Thompson said.

Passengers Unharmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A train on the new Southern California
light-rail trolley line derailed when a metal wire prevented it
from switching smoothly.
   The 30 passengers aboard the Japanese-built, overhead-powered
train were unhurt when the cars left the tracks early Sunday, said
Jim Smart, a Southern California Rapid Transit District spokesman.
The train, which has a top speed of 55 mph, was traveling only
about 10 mph at the time, he said.
   ``The good news is no one was hurt. No harm, no foul,'' Smart
said.
   The accident forced a three-hour closure of downtown's Pico
Station. The station is at the end of the 22-mile Long Beach-to-Los
Angeles line that began running July 14.
   Paul O'Brien, rail operations superintendent for the Southern
California Rapid Transit District, said the derailment apparently
was caused by a 4-inch-long metal wire that became wedged between
switching tracks.
   The $877 million Blue Line is the first stage of an ambitious
150-mile, $10 billion rail system that transportation officials
hope will make commuters forsake their smog-spewing cars.

<HEAD>Engineers Working on Controversial Canal Project Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHANDIGARH, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh gunmen burst into a meeting of
senior government officials today and killed two engineers working
on a controversial irrigation project, police said.
   The victims, M.L. Sekhri and A.S. Aulakh, were in charge of
constructing a canal that will divert river waters from Punjab
state to other parts of India.
   Police inspector Jaspal Singh said three Sikhs entered a meeting
on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal Project. The Sikhs then fired
automatic weapons.
   Sekhri, 52, and Aulakh, 50, were killed and two officers were
injured, Singh said.
   The assailants fled from the offices of the construction project
on motor scooters, he said.
   The offices are located in a busy market complex in Chandigarh,
the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states.
   The canal is supposed to divert water from the Sutlej river to
the Yamuna river. Work began in 1982 and is nearly completed,
government officials say.
   Sikh politicians, whose support largely comes from Sikh farmers
in Punjab, fear the project will deprive the state of irrigation
facilities.
   Sikh militant groups, agitating for an independent nation in
Punjab, have also opposed the canal. In May 1988, 32 laborers
working on the project were killed by Sikh radicals.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are
in a slight majority in Punjab. The militants began fighting for
independence in 1982, accusing the Hindu community of cultural and
political discrimination. Nationwide, Hindus make up 82 percent of
the population.
   The militants have killed at least 1,456 people in Punjab this
year in their quest for a separate nation.

   Rescue workers used a jackhammer to free a
13-year-old boy who was trapped for 8{ hours after his leg got
stuck in a hole in a creekbed.
   ``I'm OK, I'm fine,'' the boy, William Burnett, told rescuers as
they worked to free his right leg Sunday evening.
   Bexar County Sheriff's Sgt. Ed Olivares said the boy was walking
in Helotes Creek with some friends around 3 p.m. when he fell into
a hole. His leg got pinned when rocks fell into the hole.
   After they were unable to free the boy with pickaxes, rescuers
used a compression jackhammer to chip away at the rock surrounding
the hole, said police Officer Perry Rose. He was finally freed
about 11:30 p.m.
   To keep water away from the boy during the rescue effort,
workers used earth-moving equipment to build a 4-foot-tall dam, and
then pumped water out of the area around the boy.
   Rose said Burnett's right leg was swollen but not broken. The
boy was taken to San Antonio's Methodist Hospital for observation.
   Helotes Fire Capt. Kurt Johnson said he thought the hole was
originally part of a concrete well casing. But others said the hole
had been drilled into the creek bed several years ago to gather
core samples.
   Originally, authorities had feared that severe storms forecast
for the area would put the boy in danger, but the rain remained at
bay. The creekbed is dry much of the year.
   Helotes is a town of about 1,800 just northwest of San Antonio.

<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers resigned en masse
today, demanding new elections and accusing President Roh Tae-woo
of using sensitive inter-Korea issues to divert attention from
pressing domestic problems.
   The resignations of all 79 opposition members in the 299-member
National Assembly could throw the country into political crisis as
it prepares for the first meeting ever between the prime ministers
of North and South Korea.
   The Roh government announced today that it was willing to
negotiate with the Communist north on conditions the north is
setting for opening the border between the Koreas to travelers.
   In a dramatic speech on Friday, Roh proposed that the common
border be opened for five days in August on a trial basis, allowing
people on both sides free travel. He said open borders could lead
talks on unification.
   But North Korea demanded that South Korea scrap its
anti-Communist national security laws, release prisoners jailed for
promoting unification and allow South Korean dissidents to attend
an Aug. 15 border rally sponsored by North Korea.
   North Korea today proposed expanded high-level talks among
government and political leaders of the two sides Friday. North
Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo,
reported the proposal.
   Longtime observers view the border talks as part of a continuing
sporadic dialogue between rivals. Mutual distrust has blocked any
real progress in prior talks.
   Three South Korean Cabinet ministers said Seoul is willing to
negotiate conditions set by the north and also suggested the two
sides meet on Friday.
   ``In order to open the border and realize grand national
exchanges, we are ready to discuss any problems related to it,''
Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul said on national radio and
television.
   Hong and other Cabinet ministers said North Korea has a number
of barriers to free travel and a poor human rights record.
   Justice Minister Lee Jong-nam cited reports by international
human rights groups that North Korea is holding 152,000 political
prisoners at 12 concentration camps. He also noted that the north's
constitution makes communization of the south the country's top
goal.
   The heavily fortified border is tightly sealed, and more than
1.5 million troops are stationed on either side behind bunkers and
barbed wire. There is no mail, travel or other communication
between the nations.
   Kim Dae-jung, head of the leading opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, said his party welcomed efforts for border openings with
North Korea. But he said Roh should not use the issue to bolster
what he called sagging support for the governing Democratic Liberal
Party.
   The mass resignations from Parliament included 71 members of
Kim's party and eight members from the splinter Democratic Party.
   The legislators cleaned out their offices and said they and
their staffs would refuse further government paychecks as of today.
   They said they would not return unless the governing party
agrees to discuss their demands, including new elections. They also
want 26 controversial bills that were pushed through the
legislature at a special session earlier this month returned to
committee.
   Roh's party was a minority party in Parliament until it merged
in January with two smaller groups, giving it a two-thirds
majority. The opposition says the legislature's makeup no longer
reflects the wishes of voters and new elections must be held.
   The governing party said the resignations would not be
immediately accepted. Under Korean law, the speaker can refuse to
accept the resignations until the next parliamentary session _ in
September _ when they would be voted upon. Opposition lawmakers
said they considered themselves finished with Parliament,
regardless of how the resignations are dealt with.
   On Saturday, anti-government protesters clashed with police
after a huge opposition rally that attracted an estimated 300,000
people. Fighting broke out when riot police firing tear gas blocked
a column of about 20,000 radical students chanting anti-government
slogans.
   Police said 195 protesters were arrested. There were no reports
of injuries.
   The rally had been called to celebrate talks to unify the two
opposition parties with a nationwide dissident group by September.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the pro-Western south and
Communist north at the end of World War II. The nations fought the
Korean War from 1950 to 1953, and are technically still at war
because no peace treaty was signed.

   A retired couple apparently were asleep
when a large boulder tumbled down a mountain and crashed through
their cabin, killing them both, officials said.
   The boulder, estimated to be 25 feet by 20 feet, broke loose
from a mountain near the mouth of the Big Thompson Canyon at about
6:30 a.m. Sunday, said Larimer County Undersheriff Marv Schlageter.
   The undersheriff said the boulder tore through the cabin,
knocking it off its foundation, and came to rest nearby.
   The victims were identified as Charles and Dorothy Brown, who
had retired and moved into the cabin less than a year ago. The site
is about eight miles east of this Rocky Mountain resort town.
   Recent heavy rains apparently caused the boulder to break free,
Schlageter said.

   A U.S. military team goes to Cambodia
on Tuesday to examine what may be the remains of Americans missing
from the war in Indochina, a spokesman said.
   It will be the first such mission since the 1975 communist
takeover in Cambodia.
   The United States does not recognize the Vietnamese-installed
Phnom Penh government and has supported guerrillas fighting for its
overthrow.
   But Wednesday, the United States announced it was withdrawing
recognition of the guerrilla coalition and would open talks with
Vietnam on ending the Cambodian war.
   The six-man team leaves from Bangkok aboard a U.S. Air Force
plane and will stay overnight in Phnom Penh, said team spokesman
Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd.
   He said if the remains are identified as those of Americans, a
17-member team will fly to Cambodia on Thursday to take the remains
to Hawaii.
   Boyd would not say how many sets of remains will be examined. At
least 82 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing in action in
Cambodia, he said.
   U.S. officials have also said there are at least eight civilians
reported missing in Cambodia, including four journalists, two
contractors, a merchant seaman and a missionary.
   Most American servicemen missing in Cambodia are airmen. U.S.
airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973.
   Earlier this month, John Gunther Dean, the last U.S. Ambassador
to Cambodia, made a six-day visit to Phnom Penh _ his first since
carrying out the U.S. flag out in 1975.
   The U.S. severed relations with Cambodia in 1975 after Communist
Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized power. During their four year rule,
the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people as they
tried to implement radical agrarian reforms.
   Phnom Penh said in 1984 it was willing to cooperate on the issue
of missing Americans and declared in 1988 that it was willing to
hand over remains. But the repatriations have been delayed by the
diplomatic stalemate.
   Cambodia's premier, Hun Sen, was quoted as saying in February
1989 that his government had eight sets of American remains and was
searching for more.
   Last month, the Cambodian government said it had set up a
five-man commission led by a deputy minister to help search for the
remains of U.S. servicemen.
   There are 2,353 Americans missing from the war in Indochina. The
largest number, 1,719, are missing in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Chess Expert Says He Has Cracked Puzzle in Missing Woman Mystery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A chess expert, drawing inspiration from Sherlock
Holmes and Lewis Carroll, said today he believes he has cracked a
puzzle that could lead to the whereabouts of a woman missing since
January.
   Police believe the woman is buried somewhere in Ireland, and the
chess expert's work ``would appear to reinforce these views,''
Detective Superintendent Roy Fletcher of Lancashire Police said.
   The puzzle, drawn by a man arrested in connection with the case,
is a crude map and a series of moves for a black king, a black
queen, a black pawn and ``white king _ all pawns.''
   Raymond Keene, chess correspondent of The Times of London and an
international grand master, said the puzzle's author shows
``tremendous intellectual arrogance, allied with a perverted
ingenuity and rooted in the belief that he can dangle all sorts of
intellectual clues in front of the police's nose without their
being able to solve them.''
   Fletcher said Therese Terry, 43, has been missing since January.
Colin English was arrested in June and charged with fraud in
relation to funds taken from Mrs. Terry's bank account.
   ``While in custody he drew a map which he says gives the answer
to where she is buried,'' Fletcher said. ``He claims she died at
her own hand.''
   Keene, who was given the puzzle Friday, said he was unable to
pin down the burial site, but ``it is my firm belief that the body
is located ... some miles northwest of Limerick.''
   Keene wrote in today's Times that the diagram was a crude mirror
image of southern Ireland, rotated 90 degrees to put east at the
bottom, and that Roman numerals stood for various places in England
and Ireland.
   He believes the black king is the suspect, the black queen is
the victim, the black pawn is the suspect's brother, and the white
pawns are the police _ ``a scarcely veiled insult to the suspect's
assessment of the competence of the police force.''
   Keene wrote that the moves appear to show events between Jan.
18, when Mrs. Terry left Lancashire for London, and Jan. 23, when
English returned from Ireland.
   Keene said that while trying to solve the puzzle, he recalled a
Sherlock Holmes story called ``The Dancing Men,'' in which Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective breaks a code that used
figures of dancing stick men.
   He also was inspired by Lewis Carroll's story in which Alice
enters a world of reflections peopled mainly by chess pieces.

   Sacha Pitoeff, an actor and director best known for
his stage productions of Chekhov and Pirandello, has died of a
heart ailment, associates said today. He was 70.
   Pitoeff, who died in a Paris hospital Saturday, was the last
survivor of a theatrical dynasty founded by his Russian-born
parents, Georges and Ludmilla Pitoeff.
   Born in Geneva on March 11, 1920, Pitoeff joined his father's
company in 1938. His father died in 1939, and his mother took over
the company and kept it functioning in Switzerland during World War
II.
   Pitoeff formed his own company in France in 1949, and become
renowned for productions of Chekhov classics such as ``The Sea
Gull,'' ``The Cherry Orchard'' and ``Uncle Vanya.'' He also
produced on several occasions, most recently in 1977, one the plays
favored by his parents, Luigi Pirandello's ``Six Characters in
Search of an Author.''
   He acted in several films, including ``Last Year At Marienbad.''
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Members of a political party
considered close to Tamil Tiger rebels today resigned from
Parliament to protest what they called atrocities by the military
in its war against the guerrillas.
   The government declared a curfew in the northern district of
Kilinochchi and began search operations for rebels involved in a
fierce gun battle with troops Sunday. At least nine soldiers and 18
rebels were killed in the battle, military officials said.
   The deaths were among 122 reported Sunday.
   At least 76 rebels were killed in what the officials described
as mopping up operations in the east. Eight soldiers and three
civilians died in other fighting in the north, they said.
   The bodies of eight Moslems, believed killed by the rebels, were
found in the east, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The deaths raise to at least 2,856 the number of combatants
killed since fighting resumed June 11 between the rebels and
security forces. Many civilians also have died.
   All 11 members of the Eelavur Democratic Front resigned from
Parliament today. ``We do not want to be dormant spectators who
witness the tormentation of our people,'' they said in a statement.
   The Front won 13 of the 225 seats in Parliament in the 1989
general elections. Two of its members resigned earlier this year
for personal reasons.
   Last month, the group called for a cease-fire between the Tamil
rebels and the government. President Ranasinghe Premadasa rejected
the offer, asking the rebels to lay down their arms first.
   ``It appears that the hope we had that the solution be made
through political measures is not sensible,'' the statement said.
``The chance to find a solution to the problems of the
Tamil-speaking people is out of reach.''
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population and say they
are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese. Tamil rebels
began fighting for an independent homeland in 1983. The Tigers are
the largest rebel group.

<HEAD>Trial of 24 Ceausescu Aides Adjourned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of 24 top associates of
ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was adjourned for two
weeks today to permit medical examinations of the defendants.
   The 24, all former members of the Communist Party Politburo, are
accused of backing Ceausescu's orders to shoot at peaceful
demonstrators in December. Those protests marked the start of the
revolution that led to Ceausescu's overthrow.
   The defendants face maximum sentences of life in prison on
charges of complicity in mass killings.
   The defendants pleaded innocent to the charges.
   The trial, which opened Saturday, was first adjourned after the
defense requested that the president of the five-man military
tribunal be replaced.
   The defense argued that Ion Nistor was potentially biased
because he was one of the five judges who conducted the secret
trial against Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, after they were
deposed. The Ceausescus were found guilty and were executed Dec. 25.
   The death penalty was outlawed after their execution.
   Nistor and the rest of the tribunal were replaced and the trial
was resumed. But it was again adjourned today after the new
president of the tribunal, Capt. Bogdan Graur, agreed to the
defense request for medical examinations for most of the defendants.
   The defendants have complained that harsh prison conditions have
led to the deterioration of their health.
   The trial was adjourned until Aug. 8.
   Former Vice-Premier Ion Radu, one of the defendants, described
jail conditions as ``deplorable.''
   Dumitru Popescu, former rector of the Academy of Social and
Political Studies that trained Communist officials, said ``the
rats, mosquitoes and the smell jeopardize our life and capacity of
telling the truth.''
   Other defendants complained of loss of weight and memory while
in detention.
   Three of the defendants were not present in court because of
illness, including former Premier Constantin Dascalescu. Media
reports say he has tried to commit suicide at least twice while in
detention.
   The charges against the 24 are based on their participation in a
telephone conference of the ruling Politburo in December at which
Ceausescu gave the orders to open fire on demonstrators. According
to the official transcript from the meeting published in Bucharest
dailies, the defendants agreed with the decision.
   The latest official figures show that at least 1,038 people were
killed in the uprising against Ceausescu's rule.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Greg LeMond won his third Tour de France
title in five years, and two more victories in bicycling's most
prestigious race would put him in the category of all-time greats
in a sport long ruled by Europeans.
   For the next two years, the 29-year-old native of Wayzata,
Minn., said he intends to pedal his bicycle more and peddle himself
less.
   LeMond got himself in trouble by accepting too many outside
activities that cut into his training time over the winter. It was
a frantic rush to get back into shape and he doesn't want to go
through it again.
   ``My next two years, I am dedicating myself to cycling,'' LeMond
said. ``I will be try to be back and strong next year.''
   Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault share the
record of five victories in the Tour de France.
   Cheered by thousands who gathered along Paris' famed Champs
Elysees, LeMond stayed with the rest of the pack Sunday. It was
enough for him to preserve his two-minute, 16-second lead over
Italian Claudio Chiappucci, and take his second title in a row.
   In 1986, LeMond was the first American to win the race.
   LeMond fell behind early in the three-week, 2,112-mile race and
trailed by nearly 10 minutes at the midway stage. He narrowed
Chiappucci's lead to five seconds after the 16th stage, but
remained in second place until surging ahead in Saturday's time
trial.

<HEAD>Nick Faldo Wins British Open by 5 Shots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nick Faldo snatched his second
British Open golf crown in four years with the exactitude that has
become his trademark and has made him the world's dominant player.
   The 33-year-old Englishman beat American Payne Stewart and Mark
McNulty of Zimbabwe by five strokes and finished two shots off the
tournament record with an 18-under par total of 270. He shot a
one-under par, final-round 71 on Sunday at St. Andrews, the world's
oldest course.
   Faldo has topped four of the last 13 major championships,
including the Masters in April. He missed making a playoff in the
U.S. Open in June when a putt on the final hole refused to fall.
   Faldo is the first player to win two majors in a season since
Tom Watson in 1982.
   The performance was vintage Faldo, only slightly less consistent
than his 18 pars in the final round of the British Open at
Muirfield in 1987 _ his first major title.
   Faldo claimed $154,000 for his victory in a tournament that lost
its defending champion, Mark Calcavecchia, after two rounds. The
cut was at a record-low 143, 1-under par, and among the other
casualties were Seve Ballesteros, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite.
   Also missing the cut by one stroke was Arnold Palmer, playing in
his final British Open 30 years after his first at St. Andrews.

<HEAD>Poland Considering Gas Masks for Polluted Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering issuing up
to 100,000 gas masks in southern Poland to protect people from air
pollution, an official said today.
   A proposal is being drafted to distribute them in heavily
industrialized Katowice province, said Col. Czeslaw Bujala of the
provincial Civil Defense Office.
   Air and water pollution has reached desperate levels across
Poland because of outdated factories, a heavy dependence on coal,
and decades of neglect of the environment.
   The problem is particularly severe for the 4 million residents
of Katowice, in the Silesia region. Katowice accounts for 20
percent of Poland's industrial output and 30 percent of its air
pollution. The province makes up 2 percent of the national
territory but has a population density five times the national
average. A 1988 report said it is home to a quarter of Poland's 900
worst-polluting plants.
   Elevated infant mortality rates, substantially increased cases
of tuberculosis, cancers and other diseases as well as shortened
life expectancy are documented in the region.
   The province has 1,053 factories making hazardous materials or
using them for production, the Zycie Warszawy newspaper reported.
It said initial plans call for distributing gas masks to up to
100,000 people, particularly those living near seven plants
considered the most dangerous in case of accidental emissions, the
newspaper said.
   Bujala confirmed the report and said by telephone, ``We have the
gas masks and we are considering giving them to people, mainly to
those who live near factories producing toxic elements.''
   The plan still must be approved by Civil Defense headquarters,
he said.
   The new Solidarity-led government has vowed to address the
pollution problem but is hampered by lack of funds.
   Environmental Minister Bronislaw Kaminski recently published a
list of the 80 worst polluting factories and ordered them to meet
emissions standards or face possible closure.

<HEAD>British, Czechoslovak Foreign Ministers Sign Anti-Terrorist
Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd of
Britain and his Czechoslovak counterpart, Jiri Dienstbier, signed
an anti-terrorism pact today to strengthen cooperation between
their countries, the state CTK news agency reported.
   Hurd, who arrived Sunday for a three-day visit, also met today
with President Vaclav Havel to discuss British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's visit to Czechoslovakia in the fall. No date
was announced.
   The anti-terrorism accord provides for cooperation in fighting
drug trafficking and organized crime. It calls for granting mutual
assistance in investigating individual cases, as well as a general
exchange of information. The agreement takes effect immediately,
the agency said.
   Czechoslovakia has been a major exporter of Semtex, a virtually
undetectable explosive believed to be used by terrorists worldwide.
   During an official visit to London in March, Havel disclosed
that Prague sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex over the past 10 years
but said the sales stopped some time ago.
   Security experts say the explosive has been used in a number of
terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747
over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, which killed 270 people.
   During their talks today, Hurd and Dienstbier also discussed
questions of European security, including the future of NATO and
Warsaw Pact military alliances, CTK said. It did not elaborate.
   Earlier this month, the two countries signed an agreement on
private investments in Czechoslovakia that offers government
guarantees to future British investors and safeguards their
property in the country.
   ``Both ministers agreed that Czechoslovak-British relations are
currently at their highest level in the entire postwar history,``
CTK said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee announced today he will oppose future production of the
B-2 bomber, a major boost to House efforts to kill the aircraft
President Bush has sought.
   ``Production of the B-2 should be stopped and the production
facility should be mothballed. Research and development should be
continued and completed,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said in a speech
to be delivered on the House floor.
   Aspin cited the increasing fiscal constraints on the defense
budget as the basis for his decision. The chairman noted that five
strategic programs _ the B-2 bomber, the C-17 transport plane, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, the A-12 attack plane and the light
helicopter _ will cost more than $300 billion.
   Specifically, the cost of a single B-2 bomber is estimated at
nearly $860 million, a price tag that has caused sticker shock
among members of Congress.
   ``The answer to the question of whether the B-2 will be as
stealthy and otherwise work as advertised is: The early results are
good, but we just don't know yet,'' Aspin said.
   In the final analysis, the Armed Services chairman said the
program turned up no ``unique and compelling mission for the B-2.''
   In proposing a $307 billion defense budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, Bush called for $5.5 billion for five of the
radar-evading aircraft and related items.
   Faced with a diminishing Soviet threat and a burgeoning federal
deficit, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in April revised the
administration's request to two planes in fiscal 1991.
   Cheney also cut the total number of planes to built from 132 to
75 at a total cost of $63 billion.
   Aspin's announcement is certain to help legislation sponsored by
Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Rowland, R-Conn., and John
Kasich, R-Ohio, to stop production of the planes at the 15
currently in development.
   In his speech, Aspin said he would incorporate the
Dellums-Kasich-Rowland amendment in his proposal to the committee.
   Last year, the legislation failed in the House by a vote of
279-144, largely because Aspin opposed the bill and joined forces
with Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., on a compromise bill that scaled
back the program.
   The Aspin-Synar amendment was approved 257-160.
   Although proponents of the House measure are optimistic they can
kill the program, support for the bat-winged aircraft in the Senate
remains strong.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving a $289 billion
defense bill earlier this month, approved the administration's
request for two planes in fiscal 1991 and the panel's chairman,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., remains a strong supporter of the aircraft.
   Aspin's decision comes as his panel is scheduled to begin
crafting their version of the defense bill for fiscal 1991. The
committee will draw up a budget to a total of $283 billion, $24
billion less than Bush proposed.

<HEAD>Report: PLO Leader Says Abu Nidal Holds Swiss Red Cross Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss newspaper today quoted a top
PLO official as saying terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal planned the
October kidnapping of two Swiss Red Cross workers and is holding
them in Lebanon.
   The Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper reported that Salah Khalaf,
the No. 2 figure in the PLO, said records confirming Abu Nidal's
involvement in the abduction were found last month after the PLO
seized a base used by Abu Nidal supporters in the Rashidiyeh
refugee camp in Lebanon.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council have been involved in a bitter feud
since Abu Nidal split with the PLO in 1973.
   No group has formally claimed responsibility for the kidnapping
of Emanuel Christen, 32, and Elio Erriquez, 23, two specialists at
the artifical limb center operated by the International Committee
of the Red Cross near Sidon.
   Three days after their disappearance, Lebanese police said they
were held by the Fatah-Revolutionary Council. But on Oct. 16, Abu
Nidal issued a statement denying any role in the abduction.
   Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, said Abu Nidal is waiting for
the Swiss to open negotiations with his group. The newspaper quoted
Khalaf as urging the Swiss not to let themselves be blackmailed.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is believed to be
in Libya.
   A U.S. State Department report last year described Abu Nidal as
the world's most dangerous terrorist. It blamed his hirelings for
34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries since 1973.
   At least 900 people were killed or wounded in these attacks, the
report said. The atrocities included the December 1985 attacks on
Rome and Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people.
   Abu Nidal's group was torn by a bloody internal feud in late
1989 in which some 200 dissidents were slain. The group's strength
is now estimated to be less than 100.
   Christen and Erriquez are among 16 Westerners, including six
Americans, believed held hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Masked Palestinians in the occupied territories
hacked to death one alleged collaborator and strangled a second
Arab suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities, Palestinian
reports said.
   Fourteen Palestinians accused of cooperating with Israeli
officials have been killed since July 1 despite repeated orders by
the underground Palestinian leadership not to execute suspected
collaborators without PLO approval.
   The body of one victim was discovered in the West Bank town of
Qalqilya and the second was killed in the Gaza Strip's Rafah
refugee camp, the army said. It said police were investigating the
deaths.
   In Qalqilya, Arab reports said, five Palestinians abducted
26-year-old Ahmad Atturi from his home Sunday night and then
stabbed and hacked him to death. Atturi, suspected by Arabs of
cooperating with the Shin Bet security service, was beaten by
masked men six months ago and then released.
   The victim in Rafah was 22-year-old Issam Nawajaha, who was
found strangled to death on the street after being seized by masked
Palestinians, Arab reporters said.
   Nawajaha, who worked in Israel as a day laborer, was accused of
aiding Israeli authorities, camp residents said.
   The two deaths raised to 242 the number of Palestinains slain by
fellow Arabs during the uprising on suspicion of cooperating with
Israeli authorities.
   During the 31-month-old revolt, 723 Palestinians have been slain
by Israeli soldiers and civilians, and 45 Israelis have died in the
violence.

   Peace activist Abie Nathan has been charged
with violating Israeli law by meeting with PLO leader Yassir
Arafat, a Justice Ministry spokeswoman said today.
   Spokeswoman Etti Eshed said no trial date has yet been set on
the charge, the second time Nathan has been so charged.
   Nathan was sentenced in October to six months in prison after
being convicted of meeting with Arafat and other leading figures in
the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1988.
   Released after four months for good behavior, he then traveled
to PLO headquarters in Tunis and again met with Arafat.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization, and an
amendment to Israel's anti-terror law passed in 1986 prohibits
Israeli citizens from meeting with members of such groups.
   Nathan, 63, said he met with Arafat in March to protest the
anti-terror amendment, ``which is an obstacle to peace.''
   Most Palestinian leaders maintain Israel should negotiate with
the PLO as their representative.
   Palestinians have been waging a 31-month-old revolt against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Nathan said he was convinced a majority of Israelis were ready
to talk to the PLO, and warned that if again convicted he would
``use all non-violent measures'' to fight the amendment.
   ``I will even risk my life,'' he vowed.
   Nathan is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private
plane to Cairo in 1964 to try to convince Egypt to make peace with
Israel. In 1978, he went on a 45-day hunger strike to protest the
building of Jewish settlements in the occupied lands.
   He also runs a popular ship-based radio station _ The Voice of
Peace _ off Israel's Mediterranean coast.

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
today acknowledged that ANC guerrillas have been infiltrating South
Africa and many have been arrested, but it denied reports of a
revolution plot.
   South Africa's Communist Party also denied the allegations,
which said Communist Party members within the ANC were planning an
insurrection without the approval of the African National Congress.
   Also today, police reported 21 people killed Sunday night and
today following battles in two Johannesburg-area townships between
ANC supporters and members of the Zulu-based Inkatha party.
   The Communist Party said in a statement that the government
allegations, reported in newspapers Sunday, were a ``Red-scare
tactic'' designed to coincide with a Communist rally planned this
weekend in the black township of Soweto.
   An ANC leader, Walter Sisulu, also denied the newspaper reports,
which quoted government sources as saying a secret unit of ANC
guerrillas directed by the Communist Party planned an armed
insurrection because they oppose the ANC's policy of negotiating
with the government.
   The reports said the ANC military wing's command did not know of
the plot.
   Sisulu said it was impossible for the Communist Party to have a
different agenda from the ANC because the two organizations share
many leaders.
   He was quoted in The Daily Mail newspaper as saying the ANC
believed as many as 150 of its members had been arrested in recent
weeks.
   He said he assumed the guerrillas had been engaged in the
``normal activities'' of the organization and noted the ANC's armed
struggle had not been suspended.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper with strong ties to the
security police, said today that President F.W. de Klerk planned to
make an announcement about a ``national insurrection'' plot this
week.
   ``The disclosures are expected to be so serious that they will
shake the world and could have a profound effect on internal
policies,'' The Citizen said.
   The president's office denied de Klerk intended to make such a
statement.
   The State Security Council met today to discuss the insurrection
allegations, according to newspaper reports.
   The ANC executive committee also met today in preparation for
its next round of talks with the government on Aug. 6 to discuss a
cease-fire and other issues.
   The government wants the ANC to formally end its ineffective
29-year-old armed struggle and has asked Nelson Mandela and other
ANC leaders to stop ``war talk.'' But the ANC has said it will not
suspend the military wing's activities until the government has
made irreversible changes to end apartheid and share power.
   Sisulu said he expected detentions of ANC members to continue as
long as the organization had not arranged a cease-fire with the
government, but ``one thing we are not going to do is to stop the
process of negotiations.''
   A man claiming to be a sub-lieutenant in the ANC's military wing
reportedly entered the U.S. Consulate in Durban seeking asylum.
   An ANC official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Dhekumusa Jabulani Ximbe, 38, had been in hiding since police
raided his home a week ago and confiscated a cache of hand grenades
and limpet mines.
   The official said the raid was part of the nationwide police
sweep on ANC militants and Communist Party members who recently
returned from exile or infiltrated secretly.
   Police reported 21 people were found dead after running battles
in the townships of Sebokeng and Evaton after Inkatha held a rally
at a stadium.
   Police said they fired tear gas and tried to separate the
factions and that one policeman was killed by a thrown spear.

<HEAD>Rushdie Sides With Critics in Protesting Film Ban</HEAD>

   Salman Rushdie has joined his Moslem critics in
opposing a ban on a Pakistani film that depicts him as a murderer,
and a Moslem leader said today that his group will demand the ban
be lifted.
   The British Board of Film Classification has refused to permit
distribution of ``International Guerrillas,'' which depicts
Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' as the agent of an
international conspiracy.
   The board's chairman, James Ferman, said today that it had to
ban the film on legal advice that the movie appeared to violate the
law of criminal libel.
   ``It was the most difficult decision that the board has ever
taken,'' Ferman said Monday.
   ``Those of us who believe in freedom of expression ... believed
very strongly there was an argument for not increasing the
grievance of the Moslem community and taking the film with a pinch
of salt.''
   Sher Azam, president of the Council of Mosques in Bradford,
said: ``The ban clearly shows there is discrimination, double
standards and hypocrisy in high places against Moslems.
   ``Now they have made this decision, surely we will be doing
something about writing to them and saying that the public at large
should have an opportunity to see this film,'' Azam said.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in India and now is a
British subject. He has been in hiding under guard since February
1989, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran said ``The
Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam and that Rushdie deserved to die.
   The 3{-hour film portrays Rushdie as the agent of a conspiracy
against Islam and depicts him killing and torturing Moslems until
he himself is killed by a bolt of lightning.
   Rushdie believes the film should not be censored, one of his
supporters said.
   ``He feels it should not be decided in advance what the public
should or should not see without there being proof that it would
cause public disorder,'' said Frances D'Souza, chairwoman of the
Rushdie Defense Committee.
   ``The reaction of the Moslem community is in itself
understandable; they feel they have been blasphemed by the book and
feel there are two different standards being applied,'' Ms. D'Souza
said Sunday.
   Mohammed Fayyaz of London, who owns the worldwide distribution
rights to the film, said he would try to persuade the film board to
overturn the ban, then go through the appeals procedure.
   ``If still they refuse us then we will go to court,'' he said.
   The film board issued a statement saying: ``We are informed that
this video presents a prima facie case of criminal libel on a
British citizen, Salman Rushdie, and that the libel is a serious
one.''
   The board said the distributor of the film had been told that it
could be resubmitted if the Rushdie character had a new name, and
if calls for Rushdie's death were excised.
   An editorial in The Times of London noted that Rushdie's own
defense of his book is that it is fiction.
   ``The distributors will argue in turn that a film which shows
Mr. Rushdie slitting the throats of good Muslims or, more horrid
torture still, forcing them to listen to tapes of `The Satanic
Verses,' should also be construed as fiction,'' The Times said.
   It added that ``in any case a ban will mean that millions, not a
few thousands, will want to see what is now a notorious film.
Censorship always backfires.''
   Rushdie's publisher announced earlier this month that two new
books by him would soon be brought out. They will be his first
since ``The Satanic Verses'' brought the death threats from
Khomeini.
   The death threats have hampered restoration of diplomatic ties
between Tehran and London, which were effectively severed in June
1987 after a series of expulsions of diplomats.

   President Bush's opposition to abortion
remains unchanged but ``there will be no litmus test on specific
issues'' in his search for a Supreme Court nominee, Bush's
spokesman said today.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush
would meet with key advisers each day through the week as he
ponders a successor to retired Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan.
   ``He wants the best candidate, the most qualified candidate, a
person of experience and temperament and wants to pursue that
search for a person with the least constraints possible,''
Fitzwater said.
   Asked whether Bush would insist on knowing the abortion views of
his court nominee, Fitzwater said: ``We can't define what the
specific philosophy would be of the candidate.''
   ``You can expect that he would look for someone who favors a
faithful interpretation of the Constitution as opposed to seeing
the court as a legislative tool. (But) there will be no litmus test
on specific issues,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president views on the issue have not changed. But there
will be no litmus test,'' Fitzwater said. Bush opposes abortion
except to protect the life of the mother or in cases of rape and
incest.
   Fitzwater said that Bush still intends to name his choice as
quickly as possible and already had ``a fairly well defined list of
people who are qualified'' from which to work.
   Bush met with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today and other
top advisers after holding similar meetings over the weekend.
Fitzwater said that the president planned to meet frequently with
Thornburgh, Chief of Staff John Sununu and White House counsel
Boyden Gray as he narrows his list.
   In addition, the president called four congressional leaders
over the weekend to get their views on a nominee, Fitzwater said.
They were Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.; House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash.; and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   ``I think it's fair to say that most of the candidates we are
looking at have judicial experience,'' and already have undergone
review by the American Bar Association, Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, key senators say President Bush should shun
ideologues and look for solid judicial experience in his choice.
But even so, congressional leaders are suggesting that abortion is
likely to be a focal point in Senate debate no matter who the
president selects.
   ``If the president sends up somebody committed to overturning
Roe vs. Wade, there will be a battle,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, said today. If the nominee is not committed to an
anti-abortion position, he added, ``I think such a person will be
confirmed if he has a decent balanced background.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, appearing with Metzenbaum on NBC's
``Today'' show, said no one issue ``should be a determinant on a
person's future on the Supreme Court,'' and predicted the Judiciary
Committee, on which he and Metzenbaum both sit, would not ask
direct questions on a nominee's position on abortion.
   Dole said abortion ``shouldn't be the single litmus test in
picking a Supreme Court justice.''
   The GOP leader acknowledged, however, that he has warned Bush
that ``I assume the big `A' word would be the tough hurdle to
climb.''
   ``If you have to have someone who wants to overturn Roe vs.
Wade, it's going to be a bloodbath getting the nomination
confirmed, and the same is true on the other side,'' he said.
   Bush has said he hopes to have a new justice seated by October.
Brennan, who was a leading voice of liberalism on the Supreme
Court, resigned Friday.
   Conservatives have held a slim 5-4 majority on the court and
liberals fear Brennan's successor could push the court further to
the right.
   Possible candidates who have been mentioned include: Solicitor
General Kenneth W. Starr; federal appellate judges Edith H. Jones
and Patrick E. Higginbotham of the 5th Circuit; William W. Wilkins
Jr. of the 4th Circuit; and David Souter of the 1st Circuit.
   Other federal appellate judges mentioned are: Roger J. Miner and
Ralph K. Winter Jr., both of the 2nd Circuit; J. Harvie Wilkinson
III of the 4th Circuit; and Pamela A. Rymer, a former federal
district judge whom Bush recently put on the 9th Circuit.
   There also has been speculation Bush might want to appoint the
court's first Hispanic justice. Possible candidates would be
Ferdinand Fernandez, a federal judge from California, and Ricardo
Hinojosa, a federal judge from Texas.

   Two small planes collided over western
Wayne County today and crashed in a field, killing three people,
authorities said.
   The planes collided about 9:40 a.m. over Plymouth Township in
Detroit's western suburbs, Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano said.
   Chip Snider, township deputy police chief, said it wasn't known
why the twin-engine Cherokee 140 and a single-engine plane collided.
   Police identified two victims as Charles Nix of Detroit and
Robert Gunn of Livonia, both aboard the Cherokee. Nix was a
licensed pilot undergoing further training from Gunn. Their plane
had taken off from a private airstrip about five miles southeast of
the crash site, authorities said.
   The third victim, piloting a single-engine plane that had taken
off from Detroit City Airport, wasn't immediately identified.
   Witnesses said the planes caught fire and showered the ground
with debris after colliding. No one was injured on the ground,
Snider said.

   Chile considered giving asylum to East
Germany's ousted Communist leader, Erich Honecker, but decided
against it after West Germany objected, a newspaper said. Chile
denied the report.
   The West German government said allowing the ailing Honecker and
his wife, Margot, to go to Chile would be an ``especially
unfriendly occurrence,'' West Germany's respected Welt am Sonntag
newspaper said Sunday. It did not give sources for its report.
   Chile's foreign minister, Enrique Silva, told the Santiago
newspaper El Mercurio his government had not received a request for
asylum from Honecker. ``I know absolutely nothing about that,'' he
was quoted today as telling the Santiago newspaper El Mercurio.
   Honecker, 77, is in a Soviet military hospital in the Berlin
suburb of Beelitz and is reportedly suffering from kidney cancer.
East Germany, which he ruled with an iron fist for 18 years, has
charged him with abuse of confidence and unfaithfulness to the
state during his time in power.
   Authorities are also investigating Honecker's role in
promulgating shoot-to-kill orders at the border between the two
Germanys, and are looking into allegations he harbored terrorists.
   A medical committee will rule whether Honecker is fit to stand
trial.
   Chile and West Germany have good political relations, but there
is no extradition treaty between them. If West German decided to
prosecute Honecker and he were in Chile, it could present a problem.
   There have been reports in the German media recently that
Honecker was interested in moving to Chile, where his daughter,
Sonya Yaniz, lives with her Chilean husband.
   According to Welt am Sonntag, Chile was ``at first prepared to
grant Honecker and his wife asylum'' and that the ousted leader's
daughter had submitted a request for him.
   But the newspaper said the West German Foreign Ministry informed
the Chilean government that ``Bonn would have to see acceptance of
Honecker as an especially unfriendly occurrence.''
   The ministry said Honecker ``carries the political
responsibility for years of criminal activities'' of the East
German Communist government, the newspaper reported.
   Welt am Sonntag said Honecker's travel papers have been taken
away from him.
   Honecker was driven from power in October during East Germany's
peaceful pro-democracy revolution.

   In 1917, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Lenin
reassured the Moslems of Central Asia that the new regime in Moscow
would allow them to ``organize your national life freely and
without impediment.''
   In 1990, in the age of Gorbachev, many in Central Asia are ready
to call on Lenin's heir to finally honor that long-dishonored
commitment.
   AP Special Correspondent Mort Rosenblum recently journeyed to
the republics of Soviet Central Asia, and found a new mood of
dissent and assertiveness, fed by a religious revival, economic
resentment and ecological disasters blamed on the central
government.
   Upcoming shortly are the first two parts of a four-part series
by Rosenblum, ``Soviet New South,'' for use Sunday through
Wednesday, July 22-25. The first installment, b0532-533, presents
an overview of recent developments in Soviet Central Asia. It is
accompanied by sidebar b0534, a thumbnail look at the five
republics. Part II, b0463, examines the Islamic revival. Part III
focuses on what local people call ``the catastrophe,'' the
shrinking of the Aral Sea. Part IV looks at the ethnic tensions
underlying much of the recent violence in the area. The second two
parts will move Tuesday.
   The articles, which can be used separately or as a series, will
be illustrated with pictures by AP photographer Greg English, who
accompanied Rosenblum, and with Graphics by AP's Pat Lyons.

   Continued warm, dry weather and dense
smoke today hampered crews battling some of the 121 fires reported
across central Alaska.
   Ninety fire crews, or more than 2,600 people, were fighting the
fires, which had charred more than 1 million acres of timber and
tundra by today, officials said.
   Crews were focusing on just a few of the fires, said Trish
Hogervorst-Rukke, a spokeswoman with the Alaska Fire Information
Center in Fairbanks. ``They're concentrating on the fires
threatening structures,'' she said today.
   Many fire-fighting crews had been released recently as scattered
showers and cooler temperatures dampened many of the state's fires.
But they are returning because of the dry weather and highs in the
80s, said John Quinley, a National Park Service spokesman.
   No one has been injured and few dwellings have been lost,
officials said. Most of the fires have been caused by lightning.
   The 54,000-acre Tok River fire, started by lightning three weeks
ago, remains the state's most labor-intensive fire, occupying
nearly 800 firefighters. More crews are being assigned there than
at other fires because the fire is relatively close to two towns,
Tok and Tetlin Junction.
   The Beaver fire north of the Yukon River was Alaska's largest.
The fire on Sunday had burned a section of spruce forest 10 miles
wide by 48 miles long, Hogervorst-Rukke said.
   The fire had burned to within four miles of the Chandalar River,
and authorities expect it to diminish once it hits the river, she
said.
   The Kanuti Flats fire, about 140 miles north of Fairbanks, was
burning 100,000 acres on Sunday and was within two miles of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
   Authorities were monitoring the fire but it was not being
fought. The pipeline is buried beneath the tundra near where the
fire is burning, officials said.
   Smoke was a widespread problem.
   Fires along the Alaska Highway had reduced visibility to less
than 2 miles in a wide region from Tok to Fairbanks.
   ``The smoke is so dense that it's reducing temperatures and
raising the relative humidity in some areas,'' Hogervorst-Rukke
said. ``The sun simply can't penetrate it.
   ``The flip side is that we can't see the fires. We're using a
specially-modified plane with an infrared camera to look through
the smoke and locate the hotspots.''
   Visibility at the Riley Creek Visitors Center at Denali National
Park dropped to a quarter-mile at times.

<HEAD>Education Department Working on Crisis at Student Loan Guarantor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department said today it is
holding daily meetings in an effort to resolve a financial crisis
at one of the nation's largest guarantors of student loans.
   ``It's a matter of urgency,'' department spokeswoman Etta Fielek
said today after a morning session on problems at the Higher
Education Assistance Foundation.
   The non-profit corporation, based in Overland Park, Kan.,
guarantees nearly $10 billion in student loans.
   The foundation has notified the department ``that it is facing
serious financial problems,'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos
said in a statement late last week. He said the department was
considering various options that would ``ensure the availability of
new loans and the continuation of guarantees and claim payments on
outstanding loans.''
   Fielek said HEAF has asked Congress and the department to
approve a federally assisted takeover by another guarantor, the
Nebraska Student Loan Program Inc.
   But she said the department was apprehensive about that proposal.
   ``There's a problem of scale,'' Fielek said. ``There's concern
on the part of the department that Nebraska would be too small an
operation to consume something the magnitude of HEAF.''
   There are 55 guarantors responsible for repaying banks in the
event of defaults on student loans. HEAF is a national guarantor
operating in many states, while Nebraska operates in only one state.
   The student loan program will make a projected $13 billion in
loans this year and has $51 billion in loans outstanding.
   According to a report today in The Wall Street Journal, HEAF
expects a cash shortfall of $50 million to $100 million in the next
12 months.
   Part of HEAF's problem is that it has guaranteed billions in
high-risk trade school loans with high default rates. Scott Hoober,
a spokesman for the corporation, said such loans accounted for 59
percent of HEAF's portfolio in 1988 but only 35 percent in 1989,
after HEAF had begun to restructure its portfolio.

   A government satellite due for a
ride into space on an unmanned Atlas rocket is to spray the cosmos
with chemicals for a look at the Earth's usually invisible magnetic
and electric fields.
   A third attempt at launch was scheduled for 3:26 p.m. today,
despite predictions for bad weather. At midday, officials said the
chances that conditions would be good enough to launch were still
less than 50-50.
   Launch Sunday was called off less than two hours before liftoff
because of the threat of severe thunderstorms. The first attempt,
on Friday, was postponed because of a helium leak.
   A liquid helium vent duct used for engine cooling apparently
slipped off an engine outlet in the rocket's upper-stage thrust
section. As a precaution, all four vent ducts were replaced with a
new set Saturday, said Jack Isabel, spokesman for rocket builder
General Dynamics.
   ``Any time you don't launch, you are disappointed,'' Isabel said
Sunday. ``But when the weather is in sync, and we're in sync, I'm
sure we'll get off and be successful.''
   The Atlas 1 rocket, making its commercial debut, was to boost
the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite, or CRRES,
into an elliptical orbit 217 miles by 22,236 miles high. The $189
million satellite is a joint program of NASA and the Defense
Department.
   Twenty-four canisters filled with barium, lithium and other
chemicals will be ejected from the satellite over the next year.
The released chemicals will be ionized by the sun's ultraviolet
rays, creating glowing clouds about 60 miles in diameter.
   The clouds will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines,
allowing scientists to see the normally invisible charged particles
of the ionosphere and magnetosphere.
   The 2-ton satellite was to have been deployed in 1987 from space
shuttle Challenger, but the mission and all others were put on hold
after the Challenger disaster in 1986.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air
Force opted for a quicker launch aboard General Dynamics'
commercial Atlas. The satellite was redesigned to fit into the
rocket's payload fairing.
   The launch will be the first of a commercial version of the
Atlas and the eighth commercial rocket launch by an American
company. General Dynamics provided the $65 million rocket and
launch services under a barter agreement with NASA. In return, NASA
gets the satellite launched.
   Earlier versions of the Atlas were used by NASA to boost
planetary probes and other midsized payloads.
   It hasn't been a good year for NASA.
   Leaks have grounded the shuttles and John Logsdon, director of
the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said it
will take more than a successful shuttle launch to get NASA back on
track.
   ``The agency is supposed to be doing more than just getting
shuttles launched,'' he said. ``That's important, but in a sense
it's the minimum requirement.''
   Logsdon expects it will take years for NASA to clear its name
over the debacle created by the Hubble Space Telescope, a $1.5
billion project unable to fulfill its potential because of a flawed
mirror that cannot be repaired until 1993 at the earliest.
   NASA's proposed space station Freedom has come under attack by
Congress, too. A study released Friday shows up to 10 spacewalks a
week will be needed to maintain outside components of the station
unless major design changes are made.
   The Bush administration last week ordered an outside panel of
experts to consider the long-term direction of America's space
program.

<TEXT>
   Argentine novelist Manuel Puig, who
abandoned filmmaking for a literature with cinematic style and
gained fame for ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' has died of a heart
attack at age 57.
   Puig, suffering complications from gall bladder surgery, died
Sunday at a hospital.
   He had earned a reputation as a leading member of the younger
generation of Latin American writers. Puig's works often explored
the relationships between his characters' impoverished lives and
their rich, if unfulfilled, fantasies.
   He turned away from a potential career as a filmmaker to devote
himself to literature. But his style reflected the influence of
screenplays _ with little descriptive prose.
   ``I mostly hear the action,'' Puig said in a 1985 New York Times
interview. ``When I started writing, I found I trusted more the
language of the characters than the first person.''
   Puig wrote several novels, and some were later made into movies,
including ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' ``Betrayed by Rita
Hayworth,'' ``Eternal Curse on the Reader of These Pages'' and
``Heartbreak Tango.''
   Brazilian filmmaker Hector Babenco's 1985 film version of ``Kiss
of the Spider Woman,'' starring William Hurt and Raul Julia,
brought the novelist a larger international audience. Hurt won an
Academy Award for that performance.
   The novel ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' was set in a bleak South
American prison cell shared by a Marxist guerrilla and a
homosexual. Their dialogue is interspersed with the homosexual
Molina's recounting of plots of romantic movies.
   Puig was born on December 28, 1932, in the small town of General
Villegas, on the arid pampas of Argentina. As a youth, he spent
much of his free time in the local movie theater watching popular
American and Argentine films.
   He studied philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires during
the early 1950s and won a scholarship to study film in Italy in
1956. He went on to work on several films, but his futile attempts
at writing screenplays led him into literature.
   One failed attempt at a screenplay in 1961 developed into the
autobiographical novel, ``Betrayed by Rita Hayworth,'' about the
influence American movies have on the people of a small Argentine
town. It was completed in 1965 but published three years later,
partly because of problems with censorship.
   Panned by Argentine critics, the book received more favorable
reviews in France and the United States, and Puig began writing
more novels.
   With the return of Juan Peron to power in Argentina in 1973,
Puig felt increasingly alienated from his country. He went into
self-imposed exile, eventually settling in Mexico. He moved to New
York City in 1976, partly because of a heart condition, then
settled later in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.
   He is survived by his mother, Maria Elena de Puig, a brother
Carlos Puig and sons Javier Labrada and Agustin Garcia Gil, all of
whom live in Cuernavaca.
   Puig had lived in Cuernavaca, 50 miles south of Mexico City,
since October.
   His funeral was held there Sunday night. He will be buried in a
family plot in La Plata, Argentina, Labrada said.

   President Francesco Cossiga wants an investigation
into a report on government television that the CIA supported
terrorism activity in Italy and played a part in the slaying of
Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme.
   The CIA today denied the report and called it ``nonsense.''
   The allegations were made during a series of television
interviews with two men who claimed to have worked for the CIA. One
was identified as Dick Brenneke. The other wore a hood during the
interviews on state-run RAI television, saying he wanted to protect
his identity.
   The television report alleged the CIA paid Licio Gelli,
grandmaster of the secret Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, to
foment terrorist activities in Italy.
   The P-2 has been accused of seeking to install a right-wing
dictatorship in Italy during the 1970s with the help of secret
service officials. At that time right-wing and left-wing terrorist
groups were active in Italy.
   Gelli denied the TV report and said he would sue RAI for libel.
   Charges were also made in the RAI report that the CIA and P-2
were involved in the Palme murder in 1986. The killing remains
unsolved.
   In a statement issued today in Washington, the CIA said: ``The
agency flatly denies that Mr. Brenneke was ever an agent of the CIA
or associated in any way with the CIA. We repeat this public denial
because of the outrageous nature of his claims. Allegations
attributed to him regarding agency involvement in terrorist
activities in Italy or the Palme assassination are absolute
nonsense.''
   In a letter to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, Cossiga said
``the information broadcast in these transmissions requires, in my
opinion, a serious evaluation on the part of the Italian
government.''
   Cossiga's letter was dated July 3, shortly after the interviews
were broadcast. The president's office released the letter Sunday
after the newsweekly Panorama reported its existence.
   Cossiga said if the government felt the charges were
well-founded, the case should be turned over to the courts and a
parliamentary commission on terrorism. If the information was false
or reckless, he said, RAI should be taken to court.

<HEAD>Fake Doctor's Popularity Lands Him in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who prescribed tea, honey and long sick
leaves ended up in jail after a patient researching a biography of
the popular physician discovered he was a fake.
   According to a report Monday in the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda, Fyodor Kuznetsov, a 30-year-old cloakroom attendant, tired
of his job and decided to become a doctor.
   Kuznetsov, who previously lost jobs as a piano tuner and
salesman because of a drinking problem, obtained false documents
and was able to pass himself off as a general practitioner and got
a job at a Leningrad polyclinic, the newspaper said.
   ``He did not prescribe any pills,'' Pravda said of his
four-month stint at the unidentified hospital. ``Instead, he
recommended tea and honey, and was very generous with sick leaves.''
   Kuznetsov's patients liked him so much, they requested his
picture be hung at the Health Ministry and wrote to Pravda praising
his work, the newspaper said.
   ``Someone even decided to write his biography and that's how he
was found out _ and put into jail,'' Pravda said.
   The newspaper did not say if any of his patients was harmed by
his tea-and-honey treatment.

<TEXT>
   A rail placed across train tracks by
vandals derailed a high-speed locomotive with 368 passengers
aboard, but no one was injured, railway officials said Monday.
   The bullet-nosed TGV _ ``train a grand vitesse'' or high-speed
train _ was traveling at a relatively slow 78 mph when it struck
the 551-pound rail Sunday evening.
   The impact caused the train's front wheels to jump off the
tracks, but the rest of the engine and the dozen cars it was
pulling remained on the rails.
   Officials from the national railway, Societe National des
Chemins de Fer, said the rail used to block the track came from a
nearby repair site.
   Police said the incident was unconnected to a series of protests
by regional residents opposed to a plans to expand the high-speed
rail network into the Provence wine country.
   ``This was the work of idle juveniles, not train sabotage,'' a
railway spokesman said.
   The accident near the village of Cuers blocked traffic on the
Toulon-Nice line from Sunday evening until dawn Monday. A crane
lifted the locomotive onto the track and another engine towed it to
a rail yard for inspection.
   The TGV trains normally travel at 187 mph on special track
between Paris and Lyon or Le Mans, but elsewhere they ride on
regular tracks at slower speed.

<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle underwent surgery over the
weekend for cervical cancer detected in a Pap smear, according to
sources close to the family. The vice president's office said today
she is doing well.
   The operation was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital, Vice
President Dan Quayle's office revealed today. Quayle has visited
his wife there every day since the operation on Saturday, said
spokesman David Beckwith.
   ``She's doing well. We expect her home sometime this week,''
said Beckwith.
   Mrs. Quayle, 40, has been active in a breast cancer awareness
campaign. She testified before a congressional health subcommittee
in May and both she and the vice president ran in a celebrity
5-kilometer ``Race for the Cure'' to encourage women to undergo
early screening and mammograms.
   Despite her high-profile involvement in that campaign, the
Quayles appeared reluctant to disclose full details of her
condition. The announcement did not reveal what the actual
diagnosis was or where the operation took place.
   Beckwith said today he ``had no further word'' on the disease or
the operation.
   But the sources said Sunday the operation was for cervical
cancer that had been detected earlier this year. It was not an
emergency procedure, according to the sources, who spoke only on
condition they not be named.
   President Bush called Mrs. Quayle over the weekend ``to wish her
a speedy recovery,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The original announcement said Mrs. Quayle, who turns 41 on
Sunday, was ``recovering well'' from the operation and will
``resume her full schedule in four to six weeks. Full and total
recovery is expected.''
   The Quayles also urged all women to have yearly Pap tests.
   A Pap test can help detect two dozen or more medical problems,
but its primary purpose is to uncover malignancies in the
reproductive tract, said Dr. Allan B. Weingold, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at the George Washington University
Medical Center. Weingold is not involved in treating Mrs. Quayle.
   Other doctors speculated that she had undergone a simple
hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, given the White House
announcement on the length of her convalescence and the expectation
of ``full and total recovery.''
   The Pap test is named for Dr. George Papanicolau, who introduced
the procedure nearly half a century ago. It is credited with
reducing deaths from cervical and uterine cancer in the United
States by 70 percent.
   Mrs. Quayle, a lawyer and mother of three, became active in
breast cancer education last year. Her mother, Mary Tucker, an
Indiana pediatrician, died of breast cancer in 1975 at age 56.
   Mrs. Quayle has said her mother might have been spared had the
disease been detected earlier.

<HEAD>Ghost Hunters Say Spirits Thrive at North Texas Restaurant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe the dessert special at the
Catfish Plantation should be Poltergeist Pie.
   Restaurant owners Tom and Melissa Baker say the 95-year-old
house where the restaurant is located is home to three ghosts.
Employees and customers alike have reported ``otherworldly
happenings'' in the six years since the restaurant opened.
   So Saturday night, the Bakers and Dallas ghost hunter T. Everett
Bookings III gave a dinner-divination.
   Participants say the spooks didn't disappoint.
   ``The lady I was sitting next to, she said she felt sort of a
mist on her left shoulder,'' said Becky Morgan, who attended the
dinner with husband James, publisher of the Waxahachie Daily Light.
   Mrs. Morgan said she and her husband smelled roses, which
Bookings says is a sign that ghosts are present. And from their
seats near the kitchen, they heard the kitchen clock fall off the
wall at about midnight.
   ``It startled us,'' she said. ``All the kitchen workers had
already left. And the clock was sitting on a nail.''
   Bookings, who uses an alias in his ghostly profession, said he
wanted to encourage the spirits to communicate with participants,
so he had the guests sign some of his business cards and put them
in a box. He said one was returned with the message: ``Now do you
believe? Elizabeth.''
   That's the name given to one of the three suspected apparitions,
a young woman dressed in a white lace wedding dress who appears in
a restaurant window at night. She's believed to have died in the
1920s.
   Then there's farmer Will, who was in his 60s when he died during
the Depression. And Caroline, an older woman who passed away in the
1960s.
   Will is known to move around creating cold spots; Caroline
throws things and slams doors.
   The Bakers say Saturday night's tricks fell in line with the
phantasms' usual pursuits.
   Other reported happenings have included tips levitating off
tables and menus flying across the room.
   ``Some things happened. To me, you can explain them away,''
Baker said. ``And the group consensus of the people that were here,
probably a third of them would say `Hokey,' and probably two-thirds
of them would say, ``Hey, there's something here.''

   Anti-terrorist police shot tear gas and then
stormed an apartment to arrest a Finn who stole machine guns and
other weapons from a private collection, news reports said Monday.
   Newspapers said police surrounded the building where the
38-year-old Finn lived, but the suspect, who has not been named,
refused to surrender.
   After 90 minutes, police fired tear gas through his apartment
windows, broke down his door and arrested him without firing any
shots.
   The man was released Sunday after he reportedly confessing to
the theft.
   Police said after the raid they recovered 57 of the 117 weapons
stolen from a private Norwegian collection on June 26.
   Police said some of the weapons were found in the man's
apartment while additional weapons were hidden at a barn where the
suspect took police. The cache included seven machine guns,
pistols, ammunition and other weapons.
   They were apparently stolen for profit.

   Police said Monday they arrested 836
people and seized LSD, marijuana and amphetamines at a raid on a
party.
   Three police were slightly injured and needed hospital treatment
after the Sunday raid. The 836 were released Monday, but charges
may be filed in some cases, West Yorkshire police said.
   Assistant Chief Constable Denis O'Toole said after police
stormed the unused warehouse in northern England where the party
was held, partygoers and drug dealers began pelting the officers
with rocks, bricks, broken glass and smashed furniture.
   Youths who had tickets to the party _ which cost about $10 _
told reporters the police using dogs and charged into the building
without warning, swinging truncheons. The party was held in
Gildersome near Leeds, 185 miles north of London.
   Police said they found drugs with a street value of more than
$3,600 at the scene.
   The 836 people were arrested early Sunday for drug possession,
breach of the peace and criminal damage.
   The raid came just over one week after the introduction of
legislation mandating stricter sentences for the organizers of
illegal events. Fines can now run up to $36,200 or six months'
imprisonment.

   Actor Sylvester Stallone says he will flex his
brain more than his biceps in films.
   Stallone, 44, who rose to prominence with the original ``Rocky''
film about an underdog fighter, said in this week's People magazine
that audiences cannot identify with the kind of superhero he
portrayed in ``Rambo III.''
   ``I recently saw `Rambo III' again and recoiled at a scene
where, strong and invulnerable, I stood up there. I mean, I was so
invincible, I had veins in my hair. There I was, superhuman, with
my gun obliterating everyone crossing my path,'' Stallone said.
   He said filmmakers need to place more emphasis on developing
characters.
   ``Right now, we don't care about dialogue. We know it's just a
boring interlude before the action starts.''

   Isaac Stern, who has played more than 100
concerts here since his debut more than half a century ago, finally
put down his violin to relax while others made music. The occasion:
his 70th birthday.
   The San Francisco Symphony celebrated the event with a concert
Sunday before a crowd of 30,000, including cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich who donned wig, tiara and tutu to perform ``The Swan''
from Saint-Saen's Carnival of the Animals.
   A delighted Stern, whose birthday was Saturday, said the
celebration was ``the most gallant gesture that I will receive this
year, to be able to sit and enjoy.''
   Born in Russia, Stern was brought to San Francisco before he was
a year old. He made his debut with the San Francisco orchestra at
age 15.
   At Sunday's concert, Gregory Peck delivered a tribute to Stern.
   ``The name Isaac Stern means magic in the world of music, an
irresistible one-man cultural force,'' Peck said.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver

   The book will be ``about my life, my family, all the pet animals

   Stormie received the double transplant in 1984. Hepatitis

   She and her mother, Lois Purcell, are staying at a hostel near
Children's Hospital, where Stormie is being treated for hepatitis

based on a Stephen King book.
   ``She loves to be scared because she knows it's all make

<HEAD>Latvian Leader Wants Relations With Separate Soviet Republics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treaty negotiations between the Soviet Union's
Baltic republics could provide them with the basis for an economic
or political association outside the Soviet government, the prime
minister of Latvia said Monday.
   Ivars Godmanis said however, that Latvia, one of the Baltic
states considering independence from Moscow, should have separate
relationships with Russia, the Ukraine and the other 15 Soviet
republics before such a union is formed.
   ``We have concluded that direct bilateral treaties and decisions
between different states _ I have said states, independent states _
will be the fundament,'' Godmanis said in a speech at the National
Press Club.
   He called his goal ``Finlandization,'' which he defined as good
neighborly relations with the Soviets such as nearby Finland has
had. In the United States ``Finlandization'' has been used to mean
subordination to the Soviet Union.
   Godmanis noted that the Baltic states, in which multi-party
systems already exist, did not joined in the formation of the
Soviet Union in a 1922 treaty, but were occupied by the Soviets in
1940 at the start of World War II.
   Latvian foreign minister Janis Jurkans, who is traveling with
Godmanis, said that although the United States has continued to
recognize Baltic diplomatic representation in Washington since the
1940 occupation, the U.S. does not recognize his government. Its
recognition by the Soviet Union must come first, he said in an
interview.
   Godmanis said his government expects to become a member of the
United Nations, as it was a member of the League of Nations before
1940, and to have its own diplomats.

   An overcrowded boat sank in a flooded
river in southeastern Bangladesh, killing 11 passengers, police
said Monday.
   In the northwest, four children drowned Sunday in the Jamuna
river, raising to 13 the death toll from monsoon flooding in that
region, officials and news reports said. About 100,000 people have
been left homeless and 400,000 stranded.
   On Sunday, a boat capsized with 70 people on board in Matamuhuri
river at Bandarban, 155 miles southeast of Dhaka, police said,
adding it had been carrying 17 more people than its sanctioned
capacity.
   Fifty-nine people swam ashore and eight bodies have been found,
said a police official who was contacted in Bandarban by telephone.
Three other bodies were believed to have washed downstream.
   Ittefaq, a Bengali-language newspaper, said the rain-swollen
Jamuna river in the northwest has inundated an 830 square-mile area
in Sirajganj and surrounding districts.
   Many people were reluctant to leave their flooded homes, fearing
theft of their household goods, said Ittefaq, Bangladesh's largest
circulated daily. Marauders in motor boats were stealing cows and
tin roofs from abandoned homes.
   Most houses in the areas, however, have mud-coated bamboo walls
and thatch roofs that washed away with the first wave of flood
waters.

<TEXT>
   More than a century after he fell in
battle, and nearly 20 years after his bones were unearthed by a
South Carolina road crew, an anonymous Civil War soldier is headed
for a hero's burial in Massachusetts.
   ``We're going to feel very good when we finally put him to rest
in his native soil. He's had a strange journey,'' said Robert
Berkeley, a member of the volunteer 12th Massachusetts Regiment and
the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry, which re-enact Civil War battles.
   Burial is scheduled for Aug. 4 at the Massachusetts National
Cemetery at Bourne.
   The soldier's origins haven't become clear since his remains
were found in the early 1970s.
   ``I'd love to know more details, but I'm afraid they've been
lost in time,'' said Larry Fudger, administrative director of
Family Court in Sumter County, S.C., and a Civil War buff.
   ``We're just at a point now where this individual, whoever he
is, whatever he died of, is a federal soldier that fought for his
country and he needs a decent burial,'' said Fudger, who takes part
in re-enactments of Civil War battles in his spare time.
   The idea of bringing the body back to Massachusetts started in
spring 1989 when Berkeley and Fudger met at a battle re-enactment.
   The modern history of the unknown soldier goes back about 20
years, when the remains were unearthed by a road crew working in
Clarendon County, S.C., Fudger said.
   The county sheriff sent the remains to a laboratory and reports
indicated the bones were those of a man between ages 19 and 21 who
had died many years before, Fudger said.
   Fragments of cloth and buttons indicated the man was probably a
Union soldier, Fudger said. It was theorized that he died during an
assault on a Confederate supply troop in the area at the close of
the war in 1865.
   ``The road they found him on is the road the Union soldiers came
down,'' Fudger said.
   Once it was determined that the sheriff did not have a murder
investigation on his hands, the remains ``just got lost in the
shuffle,'' and have been stored at a South Carolina funeral parlor,
Fudger said.
   Because many of the soldiers in the area were from
Massachusetts, local historians think the soldier most likely came
from that state, Fudger said. Further speculation is that he may
have been black, because the 54th Massachusetts, the regiment
commemorated in the movie ``Glory,'' was in the area along with
other black regiments.
   The old forensic tests didn't determine whether the victim was
black or white and no tests have been conducted since on the
remains, Fudger said.
   Fudger said he and his fellow volunteers are glad to see the
episode draw to a close.
   ``We're just trying to do the right thing by him,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Argues Barry Was at Meeting at Time of Alleged Drug Deal</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry was in a meeting and could
not have received drugs at the time the government alleges he was
getting crack cocaine, Barry's attorney argued today.
   Two defense witnesses also testified that Barry was with them at
the meeting, but under cross examination acknowledged that the
Sept. 7, 1988, meeting was delayed until after the mayor's tardy
arrival.
   Barry's chief lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, attacked one of the
misdemeanor cocaine possession charges Barry faces by arguing that
a videotape proved Barry arrived for the meeting just moments after
10 a.m. that day.
   A government witness, Lydia Reid Pearson, has testified that she
gave crack cocaine _ and a city job application _ to the mayor
shortly after 10 a.m. that day.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin has argued that the
mayor's tardiness allowed him to pick up the drugs from Pearson at
the time Pearson said she delivered them to him.
   The two defense witnesses, former top city official Joseph
Yeldell and District of Columbia Fire Chief Ray Alfred, agreed with
Retchin's suggestion that the meeting began sometime after 10:30
a.m.
   ``I know we did have a slight delay before the meeting,''
Yeldell said.
   The prosecutor said the videotape made of the gathering confirms
that it began late.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug
use.
   Pearson's testimony is the most specific, with regard to date
and time, of any of the possession charges lodged against the mayor.
   Retchin argued last week that Barry's car telephone records
indicate that the mayor did not arrive for the meeting until
approximately 10:45 a.m., or minutes after the last call was
logged. His late arrival would have given Pearson time to slip him
the drugs as he came to the meeting, Retchin said.
   ``All that proves, perhaps, is that someone else was using the
car phone,'' Mundy shot back.
   Mundy, who expects to complete his case this week, says he may
call key prosecution witness Charles Lewis to ask him about his
ties to the family of a notorious District of Columbia drug dealer.
   Lewis, a twice-convicted cocaine dealer, has portrayed himself
as a small-time drug peddler whose distribution network was
designed primarily to keep himself and his friends supplied with
narcotics.
   But Mundy, relying on notes from a police interrogation of
Lewis, said Friday that Lewis once introduced a drug cohort to a
man identified as Rayful Edmond.
   The notes do not make clear whether Lewis met with Rayful Edmond
Jr. or Rayful Edmond III, but the distinction is important.
   Rayful Edmond III is serving two consecutive life terms in
prison after being convicted last December of running an elaborate
Washington cocaine supply network. Prosecutors estimated that the
younger Edmond's drug ring was responsible for up to 30 percent of
the cocaine supply in the nation's capital.
   Witnesses in that trial said the elder Edmond also was involved
with drugs, but he has never been charged with a crime.
   Mundy said Lewis' ties to Edmond show that Lewis was untruthful
about his own drug activity and can be used to cast doubt on other
aspects of his testimony, particularly his assertions that he
provided Barry with cocaine on numerous occasions.
   Retchin insisted in court Friday that Lewis did not know Rayful
Edmond III. Likewise, Rayful Edmond III's attorney said his client
does not know Lewis.

   President Bush and the leaders of Congress
will meet daily this week for ``hard bargaining'' to produce an
agreement to cut the federal deficit, the White House said today.
   Bush will confer with the House and Senate leaders on Tesday
before departing for political speeches in Philadelphia and New
York, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The tentative plan is for them to meet each day this week
early in the morning,'' he said.
   ``This is a period of very intense negotiations. The president
wants to give it a major push,'' he said. ``So they felt the
leadership should get together and do some hard bargaining to see
if we can't get it resolved.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters, ``We are
going to get reports back and forth, exchange ideas and approaches.
We do not intend to make agreements outside the summit group.''
   Foley said the meetings would be ``continuous'' but not
necessarily daily.
   Bush and the leaders last met on Wednesday before the president
embarked on a three-day Western trip, during which he blamed the
Democrats for ``government by gridlock'' in Washington.
   Fitzwater said Bush is aiming for a budget agreement before
Congress takes its summer break.
   ``We would hope to have an agreement between the president and
the legislative branch by the time of the August recess,''
Fitzwater said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said earlier today he
hopes for an accord by Aug. 3 or Aug. 10.
   ``We would share his view of the timetable,'' said Fitzwater.
   The Office of Management and Budget, in its mid-session budget
review last Monday, estimated that the fiscal 1991 deficit has
ballooned to $169 billion, not counting $62 billion in costs of the
savings and loan clean-up.
   ``There's still a great deal to be done on all the issues,''
Fitzwater said. ``They have reached the point where they're dealing
with very specific options and they are trying to make judgments
about them.''
   He gave no specifics.
   Bush said in Boise, Idaho, last Thursday that ``I've done my
part'' by agreeing to consider raising tax revenues, and ``now it's
their turn'' _ meaning he wants the Democratic leaders to put a
package of spending cuts on the table.
   Bush will meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., House
Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Dole.

   The Navy began its needle-in-a-haystack search
of the ocean floor today for a cargo door that blew off a United
Airlines jumbo jet and caused nine people to be swept to their
death over the Pacific 17 months ago.
   Investigators hope the door will help them establish beyond
doubt the cause of the accident.
   During the weeklong search, a deep-sea probe equipped with sonar
and a video camera will be dragged across a 24-square-mile area
about 100 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   If the door is spotted, another device will be used at a later
date to recover it.
   After their ship arrived at the scene overnight, workers this
morning began setting up a transponder field, an electronic grid
used to mark locations during the sophisticated undersea probe,
said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet.
   Flight 811 was bound for New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989, with 355
people aboard when the door tore popped off at 22,000 feet,
carrying away a section of fuselage and causing sudden
decompression of the Boeing 747. Nine people were sucked out; five
others were seriously hurt. The crew managed to return the jet to
Honolulu.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that a
deficiency in the design of the door's locking mechanism probably
indicated to the pilot that the door was locked when it was not.
The agency blamed United, the Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failure to correct problems with the door.
   NTSB investigators said the door still could provide evidence
for improving aircraft safety. The agency asked the Navy to find it.
   The door is believed to be 15,000 feet down.
   ``It's like a needle in a haystack, but a big factor is what the
bottom looks like,'' said project manager Bob Whaley.
   Whaley said the ocean floor in the search area is generally
flat, which is good for searching.
   The cost of the project will not be known until it is completed,
Anderson said.
   A search for the door was to have begun last October but was
delayed by technical problems during testing of the Orion deep
submergence search system, he said.
   The 226-foot Navy ocean tug Narragansett left Pearl Harbor on
Sunday and arrived on the scene about midnight. The underwater
portion of the search system, known as a towfish, is attached to
the tug by a 35,000-foot, triple-armored cable.
   The towfish is operated from on board the vessel. A computer
enhances its sonar findings for later analysis, Anderson said.
   The Orion system has been used once before, to retrieve an
airplane that crashed off the East Coast earlier this year,
Anderson said.
   The search will be carried out by the Navy's prime contractor
for underwater search operations, the Naval Sea Systems Command and
Steadfast Search Division of Oceaneering International Inc.,
Anderson said.
   Oceaneering International helped find wreckage from an Air-India
jumbo jet that was ripped apart by a bomb over the Atlantic in
1985, and parts of a South African jumbo jet that burst into flames
and crashed off East Africa in 1987.
   It made an unsuccessful attempt to recover vital parts from the
Korean Air Lines 747 shot down by the Soviet Union in 1983, and
helped in the search for the space shuttle Challenger in 1986,
Anderson said.

<HEAD>Researchers to Study Why Type A Polio Survivors May Suffer More
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHIE DIBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have started a year-long
study to find out why polio survivors with Type A personalities may
suffer more severe post-polio problems than less-stressed victims
of the disease.
   The study will try to determine if there is a physical reason
why the high-achieving, hard-driving Type A's become more disabled,
said Richard Bruno, a psychophysiologist at the Kessler Institute
for Rehabilitation in East Orange.
   Bruno theorizes that all polio victims suffered brain damage
when the virus struck some 35 years ago. That damage is now
beginning to show up. The condition is known as post-polio sequelae.
   ``It's like running electricity in the house with only one
fuse,'' said Bruno, chairman of the national Post-Polio Task Force.
``It worked for awhile, but they finally blew a fuse.''
   Compounding the problem, Bruno said, is that stress adds to the
damage that has already been done.
   In an earlier study, by Bruno and Nancy Frick of Harvest Center
in Hackensack, 676 polio survivors scored 18 points higher than the
norm for Type A personality characteristics.
   Bruno wasn't surprised.
   ``They have to achieve more just to be the same. They have to be
time conscious. It takes them twice as long to get dressed,'' he
said.
   The pressure to strive and excel started in rehabilitation
therapy virtually as soon as they began to recover, he said.
   The earlier study also found that 88 to 91 percent of all polio
survivors said they suffered some symptoms of extreme fatigue,
weakness and muscle pain, all occurring decades after the original
polio virus attack.
   The survivors who scored highest on the Type A test suffered the
most severe symptoms, Bruno said.
   ``These people are overwhelmed,'' he said. ``They can't focus,
they can't remember. Sleeping doesn't help.''
   Bruno said the medical community should have known that many of
the 1.6 million polio survivors would be struck by these symptoms
later in life.
   He cited the 1949 work of Dr. David Bodian of Johns Hopkins
University who ``showed that the virus killed brain cells in the
cortex that controlled motor functions. ... It wipes out nerves
that go to blood vessels.''
   Bruno wants to test his theory that nerve cells damaged by polio
are further impaired when survivors under stress release a large
amount of cortisol hormone which keeps nerve cells from using
glucose. He believes this increased damage causes the extreme
fatigue, and may account for some of the other symptoms.
   Dr. Anthony Windebank, neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., said the cortisol hormone theory ``was certainly
a reasonable hypothesis. At the cellular level it makes sense.''
   However, Windebank questioned whether personality type had
anything to do with the severity of the post-polio symptoms.
   Mayo researchers studied a random group of 50 from the 250
people still alive who were stricken with polio between 1935 and
1955 in Olmsted County, Minn., where the clinic is located. About
20 percent of the 50 had ``quite significant problems _ the muscle
pain, fatigue and increased weakness,'' he said.
   But there was no tie-in to personality traits, he said. ``When
we looked at the psychological factors, there was no difference at
all with people who were having problems and the people who
weren't,'' Windebank said.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels blasted their way into the
capital's center today, and government troops fought back from atop
high buildings. Rocket and heavy machine gun fire shook downtown.
   Diplomatic sources in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said the rebels were
loyal to a splinter group headed by Prince Johnson. Reports from
the main rebel group said Charles Taylor's fighters remained
blocked by government troops on the eastern outskirts of Monrovia.
   The sources said Taylor's forces remain blocked by government
troops on the eastern outskirts of Monrovia. The rebels who have
fought their way into the city are loyal to Johnson, the sources
said today.
   Johnson split with Taylor several weeks ago and the rebel leader
accused him of murdering several soldiers of Taylor's National
Patriotic Front.
   The dissidents subsequently attacked Taylor's forces, forcing
them to regroup and delay their assault on the capital.
   Today's attack came from the northwest from Bushrod Island,
across two bridges and through a swamp. The diplomats, in contact
with Monrovia, said the insurgents involved in the attack were
Johnson's fighters.
   Defending government troops fired rockets from high buildings at
the rebels.
   There was heavy machinegun fire and rifle fire aroiund the
telecommunications headquarters in the heart of the Liberian
capital's business district.
   President Samuel Doe has said he will remain in the capital
until the civil war is decided, and sources say even if he tried to
go sooner, loyal soldiers would not let him leave without
guaranteeing their safety.
   The 500-member presidential guard, made up of soldiers from
Doe's Krahn tribe, fears massacre at the hands of rebels who have
fought their way to within a mile of Doe's oceanfront mansion.
   Sources in Liberia said some government soldiers were urging the
president to flee to avoid a bloodbath and that there was bitter
infighting in the executive mansion. Doe has been deserted by
nearly all senior members of his government.
   Doe, in a telex to the British Broadcasting Corp., said Sunday
that he would remain until ``a clear victor emerges.''
   The presidential mansion was stockpiled with ammunition and
explosives, said a diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The president remained ``convinced he is invincible,'' the
source said, adding that he expected Doe to fight to the finish.
The source said Doe was ``relying increasingly on his belief that
black magic will save him.''
   Rebel troops have overrun all of the Bushrod Island district
containing the city's port, fuel and storage depots and repair
shops.
   Doe's eight-story mansion was like a desolate military camp,
with soldiers roaming the otherwise empty hallways. The president
was closeted in his fifth-floor apartment, away from outsiders.
   Sources inside the mansion said Doe's Krahn bodyguards had
gathered Saturday with the president and told him they would refuse
to allow him to leave unless their collective safety was guaranteed.
   There were also reports of deep divisions within the Krahn
tribe, the sources said. The Krahns fear the rebels will kill them
in revenge for the killings of many civilians who support the
rebels.
   Some retribution killings already have been reported by
journalists with the rebels.
   In exchange for allowing Doe to leave, the Krahn soldiers seek
safe passage to their home territory in Grand Gedeh County. Grand
Gedeh is Doe's last remaining stronghold, apart from his few
remaining square miles in downtown Monrovia.
   But the rebel National Patriotic Front would fiercely resist any
effort by Doe to evacuate his forces to his home region. With the
Gio and Mano tribes _ among the country's largest _ on Taylor's
side, the civil war has turned into an outright tribal conflict.
   The rebels began their offensive in December and effectively
control two-thirds of the country.
   They have accused Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup, of
corruption, mismanagement and human rights abuses. Taylor has
promised to maintain close ties with the United States if he comes
to power, but he has ruled out immediate elections.
   The African nation, founded by freed American slaves 150 years
ago, has traditionally had close ties with Washington.
   The U.S. Embassy has been trying to persuade Doe to flee the
capital.
   Washington refused to send in a peacekeeping force, and on
Saturday Doe ordered the American military attache expelled,
accusing him of helping the rebels. The United States denied the
accusations.

<HEAD>Pentagon Rules Out U.S.-Soviet Pilot Exchanges</HEAD>

   The Cold War may be over but the Pentagon says
goodwill can go too far.
   After learning that a Soviet pilot had been at the controls of a
U.S. Navy F@A-18 fighter plane during an impromptu test ride at a
July 8 air show at Kalamazoo, Mich., the Defense Department sent
word to all the services: Don't let it happen again.
   Lt. Dave Wray, a Navy spokesman, said the department ruled that
Soviet pilots would not be allowed to fly in any U.S. aircraft, and
that no American pilots would fly Soviet planes. Wray said no
reason for the prohibition was given.
   The Defense Department declined to comment, referring questions
to the Navy.
   ``I don't think anyone had any concern that a ride in the back
seat of an F@A-18 affords even a trained observer a technology
leak,'' Wray said, noting that the Blue Angels plane is used only
for show flying and for Navy training purposes.
   Wray said the Soviet pilot was invited to a half-hour ride in
the rear seat of the plane, taking the flight controls for part of
the trip. To reciprocate, the Soviets took Capt. Pat Moneymaker,
the Blue Angels' commanding officer, for a test ride in a Soviet
MiG-29.

<TEXT>
   Signs of division in China's secretive top
leadership have Beijing residents buzzing at a time when hot days
and muggy nights usually breed apathy even among the capital's avid
politics-watchers.
   Will Li Ruihuan, the up-and-coming propaganda czar from Tianjin,
prevail with his recent appeals for a kinder, gentler Marxism?
   Has 83-year-old President Yang Shangkun's hospitalization for
appendictis thrown him out of the running as a successor to senior
leader Deng Xiaoping?
   What about the latest report, attributed to a Chinese mayoral
delegation in the United States, that ousted Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang is about to make a comeback?
   And why can't ideological hard-liner He Jingzhi win confirmation
as culture minister nearly one year after he was made acting
minister?
   Among the laobaixing _ the ``old hundred names,'' China's
nickname for ordinary folk _ self-appointed experts admit their
bafflement.
   ``No one knows what's going on,'' said a college student who
passionately follows politics.
   Western diplomats also appeared baffled.
   ``There are many reasons for floating a rumor,'' said one,
before launching into a half-hour analysis that ended with a shrug.
   But all agree the summer political scene has suddenly become
much more interesting than the long winter of monolithic hard-line
editorializing that followed the crushing of last year's
pro-democracy protests.
   The shift is not immediately obvious. Portly, often avuncular
Jiang Zemin, who replaced Zhao as party chief, frequently appears
on national television leading soldiers and workers in singing the
revolutionary classic, ``Unity is Strength.''
   The official media are filled with production reports and
commentaries on strengthening Marxist education, opposing bourgeois
ideas and building party discipline.
   Most ordinary people hold closely to this line, in public, at
least. A Chinese journalist who has had to write articles
supporting the line, even though he backed the democracy movement,
said bitterly: ``It is like being raped.''
   It was the government's agreement in June to let dissident Fang
Lizhi go to England, after a year of hiding in the U.S. Embassy,
that crystallized the sense of a softening in the leadership's hard
front.
   ``You'll be busy in the coming weeks, because there will be a
lot happening,'' advised a middle-aged intellectual with ties to
the reformist camp.
   Western analysts linked Fang's departure to pragmatic Chinese
needs, such as retaining most-favored nation trade status with the
United States. But the intellectual said, ``A few months ago they
wouldn't have done it. It does show new flexibility.''
   The continued release of protesters jailed since last year added
to the optimism. A total of 881 have been freed, and sources have
said another group will be released soon.
   Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji said in Hong Kong recently that fewer
than 10 participants in last year's democracy movement remain in
jail without charges in his city. He said he expects they will be
released soon. Authorities say 355 people are still in jail
``undergoing investigation'' in Beijing. There are no nationwide
figures.
   Authorities also have announced recently they will go ahead with
plans, stalled immediately after the hard-line crackdown, for
developing a national securities market and transferring housing to
private ownership.
   Great public interest has centered on a series of speeches by Li
Ruihuan, the former mayor of the east coast city of Tianjin who
joined the party's top leadership body, the six-member Politburo
Standing Committee, after the ouster of Zhao.
   The 54-year-old Li, a former carpenter who speaks in a
distinctive, somewhat shrill voice, was put in charge of
supervising the media and cultural circles.
   He has used the role to make provocative comments on the nature
of socialist society.
   ``Making human relations tense is not the original intention of
Marxism,'' the semi-official Hong Kong China News Service quoted Li
as saying in June. ``We should in various kinds of work enable
people to have ease of mind and to be harmonious with each other.''
   The speech was widely commented on, including in a Worker's
Daily article that denounced ``erroneous leftist'' emphasis on
class struggle. The notion of a continuing struggle within Chinese
society between the proletariat and remnants of the bourgeois class
was revived after the crushing of the democracy movement last year.
   A stir also was caused by reports from Washington in late July
that indicated Zhao would be rehabilitated. The official Xinhua
News Agency denied the reports, but only after a flustered Foreign
Ministry spokesman said he couldn't confirm or deny it.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was unclear whether the source of the reports was reliable, and
that misinformation about Zhao's status could have been floated by
both his supporters and his opponents.
   ``His enemies might want to remind people of all the reasons
they don't want him to return to power _ before it happens,'' the
diplomat said.

   Christian Brando told a police officer: ``I
didn't mean to shoot him,'' shortly after the killing of his half
sister's boyfriend, the officer testified today.
   Marlon Brando sat in the front row of the jammed courtroom at
the preliminary hearing for his 32-year-old son. The actor
occasionally took notes as officials told under oath what happened
the night 26-year-old Dag Drollet was found slain at the Brando
mansion May 16.
   Officer Steve Cunningham was the first witness to take the
stand, moments after Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop
announced he was dismissing one count against Christian Brando _
possession of a silencer.
   Christian Brando remains charged with murder and a weapons
violation.
   There was standing room only in the courtroom of Municipal Court
Judge Larry Fidler, who presided over the hearing to decide whether
there is sufficient evidence to hold Christian Brando over to trial.
   Cunningham told of receiving a call to go to the Brando
residence on Mulholland Drive in West Los Angeles at 10:44 p.m.
   As he arrived at the gated estate, Cunningham said he saw
paramedics and firefighters and ``I was told there was a guy in the
house that had been shot in the head and he was dead and the
suspect was still in the house.''
   Through a window, he said, he saw Drollet lying dead on the
floor, and when he went inside he saw Christian and his half
sister, Cheyenne, who was then seven months pregnant with Drollet's
child.
   ``I got approximately three to five feet from the defendant and
he stated he didn't mean to shoot him ...,'' Cunningham said. ``At
that time, I arrested him.''
   The defense contends the .45-caliber handgun went off
accidentally during a scuffle over the weapon with Drollet.
   But authorities say that Cheyenne, who left for Tahiti and
recently gave birth to Drollet's child, said her brother threatened
to kill Drollet and got a gun the night the boyfriend was shot.

<HEAD>Administration Approves Designs of Six Revised Versions of Banned
Weapons</HEAD>

saying he made a mistake.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today it has
approved prototypes of six foreign-made semiautomatic rifles
redesigned to eliminate military-style features that resulted in
their ban as imports last year.
   However, it was unclear if any requests to import the weapons
have been submitted or approved, said Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms spokesman Jack Killorin.
   Receiving approval were new designs of the Uzi, AK-47, Galil,
HK-91, SAR-8, and SAR-4800, officials said. The Washington Post
first reported the approvals in today's editions, citing documents
obtained by the Firearms Policy Project under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   Those rifles were among the 43 styles of semiautomatic
assault-style rifles banned from import by the administration last
July. The weapons had such characteristics as threaded barrels to
accommodate a silencer; flash suppressors that could hide the
shooter's position at night and prevent a loss of night vision;
provisions for mounting a bayonet; folding or collapsible stocks;
pistol grips; and large capacity magazines.
   An administration official, speaking on condition that he not be
identified, said weapons of the type recently approved could be
adapted by the purchaser to add the prohibited features. He said
such features would be prohibited by federal law under a crime bill
now pending in Congress.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``Apparently the way the existing rules are written, ATF (the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) is not authorized to
prevent these weapons from coming in.''
   ``The new crime bill, I'm told, does rectify this problem,'' he
said. ``We look forward to signing that crime bill.''
   Fitzwater said the guns should not be allowed into the country
``if they are the same weapon that was originally banned and that
was a circumvention of the rule.''
   The White House spokesman made the statements in his daily
question-and-answer session with reporters. Later he issued a
statement admitting that he had made a mistake.
   ``The crime bill, which the administration proposed, limits the
number of rounds in detachable magazines,'' Fitzwater said.
``However, it will not influence the redesign of weapons within the
configuration of traditional sporting rifles. I was wrong to
suggest that the new crime bill will influence redesigned weapons.''
   Federal regulations require that imported rifles be suitable to
sporting purposes, and the administration determined that the 43
styles _ many of which were favored by drug traffickers _ did not
meet that requirement.
   Nine manufacturers of the banned weapons have provided the ATF
with plans or prototypes of new rifles that eliminate the
military-style accoutrements, and the ATF has told six that the new
styles meet the sporting requirement, Killorin said.
   ``The bottom line is, if the firearms conform to the changes
required, without bayonet slugs, without flash suppressors, night
sites, pistol grips and large-capacity detachable magazines, then
we're talking about a weapon consistent with semiautomatic sporting
weapons,'' Killorin said.
   Since such weapons fit the sporting requirement, the ATF must
approve them, he said.
   ``The prototypes that we're looking at are weapons that have
none of the accoutrements, not even the pistol grip,'' he said.
   A pistol grip that hangs down behind the trigger is intended to
enable the shooter to have control while firing from the hip or to
fire one-handed from the hip in a combat situation, he noted.
   Although the new designs of the guns do not have such grips,
``Some are designed with a thumb hole in the stock, a configuration
frequently seen on Olympic-style rifles,'' he said.
   Josh Sugarman of the Firearms Policy Project said the thumb hole
serves as a pistol grip, enabling weapons to be reloaded quickly
and easily and fired from the hip.
   ``In addition, they can be easily modified to full
assault-weapon configuration,'' he said in a statement.
   Sugarman noted that the rifles still can accept large-capacity
magazines even if they are fitted with limited capacity magazines,
something that is true of every firearm that takes a detachable
magazine, according to Killorin.
   ``Although these weapons may look less threatening, they are no
less deadly,'' Sugarman said. ``The industry knows this, ATF knows
this and criminals know this.''
   Killorin said the ATF was still checking to see if there had
been any requests to import the new weapons and whether such
requests have been approved.
   ``Our correspondence has been relative to prototype
configurations rather than a finished product,'' he said.
   ``The majority of our dialogue has been, `Look, if we made the
following changes, would this be importable?' For the most part,
we've said, `No, you'd have to change this and this.'''

<HEAD>Ethanol Would Be Bonanza for Corn Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production of ethanol, a clean-burning fuel
made from corn, could triple in the 1990s, but only if Congress
offers tax breaks and other benefits, a report says.
   Escalation of ethanol production would be good news to corn
growers, who would see bushel prices climb, and to the Agriculture
Department, which could then spend less on farm subsidies.
   But congressional investigators also note some possible
negatives: lower soybean prices, higher prices for cattle feed and
increased costs to consumers who purchase corn in grocery stores.
   ``Expanded use of ethanol fuels would have mixed effects on
various sectors of American agriculture,'' the General Accounting
Office said in the report, which was released last week. GAO is the
investigative arm of Congress.
   The fuel has great appeal among farm-state lawmakers, especially
this year as Congress considers new limits on automobile pollution.
   Lawmakers tout ethanol as an environmentalist's dream and a
farmer's bonanza. When gasoline is blended with ethanol, harmful
auto emissions are reduced. If the ethanol market picks up, growers
would have another use for their corn.
   In 1988, nearly 1 billion gallons of ethanol were produced. The
ethanol industry told GAO it could triple output if Congress
dangles some incentives.
   For example, there is a 9-cent tax on each gallon of motor fuel,
but the levy for gasoline made with ethanol is only 3 cents. The
industry would like to keep the 6-cent exemption and get passed a
law that would order the use of alternative fuels.
   If production is tripled, the industry would enjoy an average
annual tax break of $813 million through 1997, GAO said.
   While that might hurt the Treasury, GAO said the greater demand
for corn would reduce the need to subsidize farmers, saving the
government an average of $1.42 billion a year.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stumped by a bizarre list of chess moves and a
suspect who won't talk, police in Lancashire have turned to a chess
grandmaster to help find a missing woman.
   Raymond Keene, chess columnist for The Times of London, said
Monday he believes he has cracked the code, but he hasn't located
the woman.
   Her grave, Keene believes, is somewhere northwest of Limerick in
western Ireland.
   The case is reminiscent of a Sherlock Holmes story in which
baffled police turn to the brainy amateur, and of Lewis Carroll's
looking-glass world of talking chess pieces in which ``the
alternation of black and white is perhaps not so strictly
observed.''
   Police in Preston, in northwestern England, say a suspect has
told them that 43-year-old Therese Terry is dead, and buried
somewhere in Ireland.
   Detective Superindent Roy Fletcher, who enlisted Keene as a
tracer of lost persons, said the woman had returned to her native
Lancashire from Australia in November after discovering that nearly
$49,000 was missing from her bank acount.
   She intended to return to Australia in January, but met a man
named Colin English in London, Fletcher said.
   Mrs. Terry telephoned a friend to say she had changed her plans
and was in Dublin with her boyfriend. She was never heard from
again, Fletcher said.
   English was arrested in June, and charged with fraud in
connection with Mrs. Terry's bank account, he said.
   ``While in custody he drew a map which he says gives the answer
to where she is buried,'' Fletcher said. ``He claims she died at
her own hand.''
   English won't say where she is buried, but drew a blob marked
with Roman numerals, accompanied by a series of moves for a black
king, a black queen, a black pawn and ``a white king _ all pawns.''
   Keene took the black king to be the suspect, the black queen to
be the victim and the pawn to be the suspect's brother.
   The chart deviated wildly from conventional chess: the king
writes a letter to a ``lady in waiting.'' Black makes all the moves.
   The ``white king ... all pawns,'' Keene believes, are the
police, dismissed as ``no better than a collection of pawns, menial
foot soldiers with no directing stratgegy.''
   ``If true this gives an essential clue to the suspect's
psychology, one of tremendous intellectual arrogance, allied witha
perverted ingenuity and rooted in the belief that he can dangle all
sorts of intellectual clues in front of the police's nose without
their being able to solve them,'' Keene wrote in Monday's editions
of The Times.
   Keene wrote that the moves appear to record events between Jan.
18, when Mrs. Terry left Lancashire for London, and Jan. 23, when
the suspect returned from Ireland. He said the moves indicate
financial transactions that tally with records from Mrs. Terry's
Visa card.
   For the 21st, the puzzle reads: ``BK (plus) BQ GH _ BK BP do
this.''
   Keene believes it means, ``the suspect and his brother inflict
grievous harm (GH) on the victim. The words `do this' seem
particularly sinister in this context.''
   The blob, Keene figured, is a mirror image of southern Ireland,
rotated 90 degrees so that west is at the bottom. The numbered
points, he believes, refer to places including London and the Irish
cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork.
   An arrow points from the numeral Keene believes is Limerick to
the letters HG. ``It is my firm belief that the body is located at
HG some miles probably to the northwest of Limerick,'' Keene said.
   He thought HG might mean ``her grave,'' or perhaps ``hallowed
ground.''
   Police say they will begin searching for the woman's body in the
area identified by Keene.

   Three Cubans have entered the lightly guarded
Swiss Embassy in Havana, raising to 25 the number seeking asylum in
European delegations.
   The three entered the embassy Sunday evening, said informed
sources, Swiss officials and the Mexican government agency Notimex
on Monday.
   A car pulled up in front of the Swiss Embassy on Sunday evening,
and while the driver distracted the guards in front, an
unidentified Cuban entered the building, informed sources said. A
short while later, two other Cubans jumped the fence at the embassy
compound.
   Security was light at the Swiss Embassy but heavy at others
where Cubans have sought refuge or were thought likely to. More
police were dispatched outside the Swiss Embassy on Monday.
   Notimex said at least 40 police surround the American interest
section in Havana and that security also is heavy around the
embassies of Spain, Italy, West Germany and Canada.
   Cuba and the United States do not have embassies in each others'
countries but maintain interest sections under a 1977 agreement.
   Switzerland, which represents the United States in diplomatic
matters in Cuba, is the fifth diplomatic mission or residence used
by Cubans for asylum in the past two weeks. The U.S. interest
section is in a different building from the Swiss Embassy.
   In the Swiss capital of Bern, the foreign ministry said it was
studying the possibility of giving the three temporary refugee at
the embassy, but Swiss officials said there is committment to allow
the three to travel to Switzerland or a third country.
   The names of the three were not disclosed.
   Four Cubans remain in the residence of the Italian ambassador.
Cubans who took refuge in the Czechoslovak Embassy and the home of
its charge d'affairs abandoned attempts at asylum last week.
   Eighteen Cubans remain in the Spanish Embassy.
   Spain suspended $2.5 million in grants-in-aid and persuaded the
European Community to put three ``symbolic'' projects on hold after
Cuba issued a vitriolic attack on Spanish Foreign Minister
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez.
   Fernandez Ordonez had said President Fidel Castro is afraid his
hard-line Communist government will fall like those in Eastern
Europe if he allows Cubans to leave. Fernandez Ordonez also urged a
transition to democracy in Cuba.
   Cuba has contended the refugee-seekers are part of an
American-inspired Western plot, a charge the United States and
European countries have denied.
   The wave of embassy break-ins began two weeks ago, not long
after similar incidents were occurring at foreign embassies in
Albania. Albania, like Cuba, is a hard-line Communist state.

   The first president of NBC's consumer and
business cable channel, CNBC, is leaving it and NBC to form an
independent company that manages broadcast properties, he and NBC
said Monday.
   No successor was immediately named for 45-year-old Michael
Eskridge, who said he has a non-exclusive agreement to provide
management and consulting services to GE Capital Corp., whose
parent company, General Electric, owns NBC.
   Eskridge was named president of NBC's Consumer News and Business
Channel, based in Fort Lee, N.J., in July 1988. The service began
in April 1989.
   He said he would stay at CNBC until his replacement is found. He
said he ``never had any firm plan'' on how long he would stay at
the money-losing company, but denied published speculation that he
was forced out.
   Eskridge was praised Monday in a statement by NBC President
Robert C. Wright, who said he ``did a phenomenal job in the
start-up of CNBC ... in my opinion, Mike is the best executive in
the industry in start-up situations.''
   He and NBC officials have said that NBC expects to lose money on
CNBC for three years but predict that it will have 30 million
subscribers and will start making a profit in its fourth year.
   CNBC's main rival in the daytime is the New York-based Financial
News Network, which began in 1981 and says it now is seen in 33.7
million homes and offices in the United States and Canada.
   CNBC, co-owned by Cablevision Systems Corp., began its
24-hour-a-day operation with reported start-up costs of $65 million
and 9.5 million subscribers. It says it now serves 16.8 million
homes and offices.
   Unlike FNN, however, CNBC is not yet available on cable in
Manhattan and thus isn't seen there by members of the influential
Wall Street and advertising communities.

<HEAD>Experts: Insurance Shortage Threatens Health System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians and hospital officials pleaded for
national health insurance Monday, saying the burden of treating
uninsured patients is endangering the health-care system.
   ``There is mounting evidence that the system is on the verge of
fiscal collapse,'' said Norton J. Greenberger, chairman of the
Department of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
   As many as 37 million Americans have no health insurance,
Greenberger told the Senate Subcommittee on Health for Families and
the Uninsured. Nearly as many have inadequate or interrupted
coverage, he said.
   The number of uninsured rose 43 percent between 1978 and 1986,
Greenberger said. Meanwhile, the cost to hospitals of charity care
and bad debts more than doubled in the last decade, accounting for
5 percent of their expenses.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said the
situation ``underscores the need to develop a national strategy for
providing health care for all Americans. It ought to be clear to us
that the system is breaking down.''
   However, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told
business leaders in Atlanta on Monday that the solution to
America's health-care problems will be found in a free market where
businesses aren't burdened with requirements.
   ``Those who call for a radical revamping of our health-care
system _ suggesting nationalized medicine _ are mistaken,''
Sullivan said in his prepared remarks, which were made available
here.
   ``As much as possible, we must permit the medical marketplace to
work,'' he said. ``A dynamic economy will find some solutions on
its own. We do not want to rush in with unproven government
remedies which may create more problems than they solve.''
   There are many reasons for the rise in the number of uninsured,
including Medicaid's failure to keep pace with increasing poverty.
   High unemployment in the early 1980s, increasing numbers of
part-time workers with few benefits and small businesses that offer
no insurance are other causes, said E. Jackson Allison Jr. of Pitt
County Memorial Hospital in Greenville, N.C.
   The Senate subcommittee and a bipartisan panel are developing a
plan to provide universal health-care coverage and control costs,
Riegle said, adding that reducing the number of hospitals poses a
hazard to all Americans.
   ``The wealthiest man ... could be in an automobile accident ...
and if there's no room in the hospital, all his health insurance
and wealth don't mean a thing to him,'' he said.
   Michigan hospitals lost $350 million last year treating patients
who could not or would not pay, said Edward Thomas, president of
Detroit Receiving Hospital and chairman of the corporate board of
the Michigan Hospital Association.
   Especially hard hit are ``safety-net hospitals'' in inner
cities, said Barbara Lord Watkins, vice president of public affairs
and human services at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital.
   Safety-net hospitals _ about 300 of the nation's 6,000 hospitals
_ treat disproportionately large numbers of AIDS patients, drug and
alcohol addicts and victims of violent crime, Ms. Watkins said. Of
the 90 safety-net hospitals in the National Association of Public
Hospitals, 61 percent reported operating deficits in 1988, she said.
   About 12 million children aren't covered by health insurance and
100,000 are members of families with such tremendous medical needs
that their insurance coverage is exhausted, said Lawrence A.
McAndrews, president of Children's Mercy Hospital of Kansas City,
Mo.
   Many such families don't have incomes low enough to qualify for
Medicaid, he said. A 13-year-old boy badly injured in a car
accident was ineligible for Medicaid even though his parents'
combined income totaled only $850 a month, McAndrews said.

<HEAD>Some States Still Allow Public Schools To Teach About Religion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public schools in 13 states are permitted to
teach about religion, and the Bible may be taught as literature in
10 states, a new survey finds.
   It also shows that 23 states allow excused absences for
religious holidays and 22 mention observance of a moment of silence
in their laws or regulations.
   The survey was conducted by the National Council on Religion and
Public Education, which says its purpose is to provide a forum for
issues involving religions and public education.
   The survey, which drew responses from all states except Hawaii,
was to determine how many laws, regulations or guidelines were on
the books of states in matters of religion or moral education. A
law or regulation was counted whether it permitted or forbade a
practice.
   Teaching about religion in public schools is different from
teaching religion, said Charles C. Haynes of Americans United
Research Foundation. ``We advocate public discussion about religion
in public schools,'' he said.
   The survey was by Charles R. Kniker, assistant dean of education
at Iowa State University.
   Character and citizenship education was in the practices of 41
states, he said. The second most frequently cited curriculum
category was textbook review procedures, in 32 states; then,
numerically, in 27 states, are laws and regulations about state
textbook selection policies.
   In matters of teaching about religion, said the survey, ``few
states are as explicit as Alabama, which permits `religious facts
only,' to be discussed; many others, like Alaska, have regulations
that prohibit teaching of sectarian books or doctrines.''
   On the Bible, the survey says few states are as specific as
Iowa, which says ``religious books such as the Bible, the Torah,
and the Koran shall not be excluded from any public school or
institution in the state, nor shall any child be required to read
such religious books contrary to the wishes of the child's parents
or guardian.''
   In virtually every state with a requirement for the pledge of
allegiance, participation was voluntary, the survey said.
   ``Kentucky said that the local school boards may encourage
students to participate in the pledge and also in building respect
for the flag,'' it added.
   Wisconsin's law was cited as typical in language: ``No student
shall be compelled, against his objections or those of his parents
or guardian, to recite the pledge.''

   The county may administer drug tests to
applicants for such ``sensitive'' jobs as sheriff's deputy,
lifeguard, chauffeur and accountant, a judge has ruled.
   Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffee ruled last week the county
may test applicants without union-management talks.
   ``If the county wants to make darn sure that they don't hire a
drug user for a sensitive position, they can do it,'' Yaffee said
in turning down a union request for a preliminary injunction.
   The program, started July 2, targets certain county jobs that
pertain to, for instance, public safety and financial duties. So
far, only sheriff's trainees have been submitted to the tests.
   A coalition of unions representing 30,000 workers had wanted to
stop the program until the County Employee Relations Commission
could hear a complaint on the matter.
   ``The unions don't condone drug use, but we feel the program
should not have been implemented without union bargaining,'' said
Alexander Cvitan, a lawyer for the workers' coalition.

<TEXT>
   James Meredith, the civil rights hero who
now shuns that title, is working on a project to rewrite U.S.
social legislation as an assistant to Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Meredith said he gave Helms, R-N.C., an 18-inch tall stack of
proposals when they discussed his joining the senator's staff last
year.
   ``In a nutshell, this is what I told them I want to do: To
rewrite domestic policy legislation on the order of the Great
Society of Lyndon Johnson and of the New Deal of Franklin
Roosevelt,'' Meredith said.
   ``To be quite frank, no one was willing to say I could do it.
But Senator Helms was willing to let me try.''
   Meredith's journey from civil rights pioneer to the side of an
archconservative senator isn't as surprising as it might appear.
   Meredith, who broke the color barrier at the University of
Mississippi, was an early loner in the civil rights movement,
disillusioned by infighting and unwilling to work with its leaders,
according to former colleagues and a biographer.
   He surprised many in the movement five years ago when he
described integration as a ``con job,'' and even more when he went
to work for conservative Helms last year. But Meredith said his
behavior should not be a shock.
   ``I've been saying the same thing for many years. And they have
been very much aware of my position,'' he said from Washington,
D.C. ``I operate on the principle that the real attraction to
Senator Helms was his commitment to family and morality.''
   Meredith said last week that an elite group of powerful white
men pull the strings of many black leaders. He issued a statement
on Helms' official Senate stationery accusing NAACP delegates of
involvement in drugs.
   Meredith said black leaders have been co-opted by white liberals
whose programs are intended to reinforce control over blacks.
   ``Until 25 years ago, the black race had control of all their
domestic affairs,'' Meredith said. ``That included all of the
periods of slavery. They raised their children.''
   He said he wants authority returned to families _ authority that
white liberals have taken over through social programs.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said Meredith's statements
are irrational.
   ``I think he's had a difficult time keeping in touch with
reality,'' Hooks said.
   Helms is facing a re-election challenge by the man who broke the
color barrier at Clemson University in 1963 _ former Charlotte
Mayor Harvey Gantt.
   Democrat Gantt has said Meredith's statement was a way for Helms
to inject race into the campaign without having to personally ``say
anything that might be considered to be a racist remark.''
   Helms denied that, saying that Meredith has a right to speak for
himself.
   At age 27, Meredith returned to his native Mississippi after
nine years in the Air Force to enroll in Ole Miss. Some 16,000
troops were called in to quell rioting in which two people were
killed.
   In 1966, Meredith took off from his law studies at Columbia
University for a solo march supporting black voter registration in
Mississippi. He was shot and wounded on a highway.
   Civil rights leaders flocked to Meredith's side and stole the
limelight, said Charles Evers, who took over as the NAACP's
Mississippi field director after his own brother, Medgar, was
assassinated in 1963.
   Evers, who manages a Jackson, Miss., radio station, said he was
surprised when he found out that Meredith joined Helms' staff.
   ``He always wanted to do the impossible,'' he said. ``And he's
proved that it's not always impossible.''
   Tyrone Yates, who's working on a biography of Meredith, said
Meredith was disillusioned by infighting within the movement ``and
since his life was on the line he had no time for nonsense.''
   The year after entering Mississippi, Meredith said ``intolerance
and bigotry'' among civil rights activists endangered the movement.
   ``When he grew up, for breakfast, lunch and dinner he ate bread
sopped with molasses,'' Yates said. ``He knew what poverty was. He
probably sees these organizations as having advanced white causes
while ignoring the poor, downtrodden blacks.''

   Marilyn Quayle is doing well at Bethesda Naval
Hospital after weekend surgery and is expected to return home later
this week, a spokesman said Monday.
   David Beckwith, a spokesman for Vice President Dan Quayle, said
the family did not want to disclose the type of operation or the
disease. Sources have told The Associated Press that Mrs. Quayle
had cervical cancer.
   ``She's doing well at Bethesda Naval Hospital. We exometime this week,''
Beckwith said.
   President Bush called Mrs. Quayle over the weekend ``to wish her
a speedy recovery,'' said White House spokesman Marlipect her
home sn Fitzwater.
   Family sources who asked not to be identified said the operation
was for cervical cancer detected in a Pap smear earlier this year.
   Beckwith said Saturday only that ``full and total recovery is
expected,'' with Mrs. Quayle resuming a full schedule in four to
six weeks.
   The Quayles urged all women to have yearly Pap tests.
   Pap smears are useful in detecting many medical problems, but
are aimed especially at uncovering malignancies in the reproductive
tract.
   Mrs. Quayle, a lawyer and mother of three, became active in
breast cancer education last year. She testified before a House
health panel in May and also ran with the vice president in a

   Ford Motor Co. agreed Monday to pay a $1.2
million fine for repeatedly failing to keep track of on-the-job
injuries, the government said.
   In a separate settlement with the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, Ford agreed to launch a program to reduce ergonomic
hazards _ or workplace injuries caused by repetitive-motion tasks _
at 96 percent of its plants.
   The Labor Department called that agreement the most extensive
ergonomics settlement in OSHA's history. A Ford spokesman said
about 150,000 workers would be affected.
   The $1.2 million fine involves record keeping violations that
OSHA inspectors found in 1989, when they visited a Ford Electronics
and Refrigeration facility in Lansdale, Pa.
   Ford was misrecording or failing to record injuries that workers
had received, OSHA inspectors alleged.
   The injuries involved cumulative trauma disorders, or disorders
of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems caused by repetitive
motions. Such disorders are common occupational illnesses in the
automotive industry, where workers often have to repeat tasks on
assembly lines.
   Ford spokesman Dick Routh attributed the poor record keeping to
``carelessness.''
   ``We had not put the effort into it that we should have.
Certainly, OSHA got our attention with the size of the fine,'' he
added.
   OSHA originally hit Ford with a $2 million fine because it was
the third time the automaker had been cited for record keeping
violations and Ford had failed to live up to an earlier pledge of
improving procedures, the agency said.
   As part of the record keeping agreement signed Monday, Ford will
establish, at 12 of its facilities, an audit system for keeping
track of records involving workers' medical, compensation,
sickness, accident and health insurance information.
   The company will then cross check the records against an OSHA
log and provide record keeping training if the error rate is
greater than 5 percent either nationwide or at an individual
facility.
   On the ergonomic settlement, Ford has voluntarily agreed to
implement a program to reduce workers' risks of developing
cumulative trauma disorders.
   Several businesses nationwide have taken voluntary steps to
reduce those types of injuries as OSHA considers mandating
ergonomic programs.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, in announcing the Ford
agreement, said the effort to reduce repetitive-motion injuries
will be one of the ``greatest worker health and safety concerns in
the next decade.''
   Preventive measures include redesigning work stations, such as
adjusting workbench heights, redesigning tools, training workers
and using mechanical or other devices to prevent excessive lifting.
   Ford's ergonomic program, which will involve analyses of various
jobs and their risks, will be partially administered by the United
Auto Workers Union, which represents Ford workers.
   Last year, OSHA reached a similar ergonomics agreement with
Chrysler and the UAW to control cumulative trauma disorders in five
Chrysler auto assembly plants.
   The Ford program will include a medical management program to
provide for early identification of cumulative trauma disorders.
That would include periodic workplace walk-throughs by medical
staff, having workers fill out questionnaires every two years to
gather information on symptoms of work-related disorders and
encouraging employees to report early signs of problems.

   Mink farmers produced more than 4.6 million
pelts in 1989, the most in 20 years, the Agriculture Department
said Monday.
   An annual report showed the number of pelts was up 3 percent
from 1988, the most since 5.7 million were produced in 1969.
   The average market price was $25.80 per pelt last year, down
from $32.30 in 1988. The total value of production was reported at
$118.7 million, down from $143.8 million.
   Officials said 952 mink farms produced pelts last year, down 7
percent from 1988. Leading states were Wisconsin with 204 farms,
Utah with 175 and Minnesota with 119.

<HEAD>NTSB Fails to Find Cause of Plane Crash that Killed 3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators have failed to find the
cause of a fire blamed for a plane crash that killed a top
executive of Gulf Power Co., the National Transportation Safety
Board reported Monday.
   Southern Company Services, owner of the plane and a sister
company of Gulf Power, contended the crash last year was caused by
a fire set intentionally by the executive, Senior Vice President
Jacob F. ``Jake'' Horton.
   Shortly before the plane took off from the Pensacola (Fla.)
Regional Airport bound for Atlanta, Gulf Power officials had
accused Horton of financial irregularities. They told him he would
have to retire, resign or be fired.
   Horton and the two pilots were killed when the plane, trailing
smoke, crashed into an apartment building three miles northwest of
the airport on April 10, 1989.
   An intense fire after the crash destroyed the plane and the
building.
   The NTSB previously said the fire caused the crash, but was
unable to pinpoint the cause of the fire. In its final report on
the crash, the NTSB said its investigators couldn't find evidence
of a lightning strike, an aircraft system malfunction or an
incendiary device that might have started the fire.
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed that the NTSB has not been able
to pinpoint the origin of the fire,'' Southern Company Services
President Allen Franklin said. ``It's unfortunate for our company _
and more importantly, for the families of the three men who died _
that questions still remain.''
   Horton's widow, Frances, has filed suit seeking damages from
Southern Services, a subsidiary of the Southern Co., the
Atlanta-based holding company that also owns Gulf Power and four
other utilities. She claimed the company had negligently maintained
and operated the plane.
   Southern Services filed a countersuit against Horton's estate,
saying Horton intentionally set fire to the plane.
   Gulf Power, which provides electricity in the Florida Panhandle,
was under investigation at the time by a federal grand jury in
Atlanta. The utility subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of
making illegal political contributions, paid a $500,000 fine and
accused Horton of being the primary culprit.
   Also killed in the fire were Southern Company Services pilots
Mike Holmes and John Major, both of Biloxi, Miss.

<HEAD>Distributor to Fight British Ban on Rushdie Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The distributor of a film that portrays the death
of author Salman Rushdie said Monday he will fight a ban by
Britain's film board, arguing the film is a purely fictional.
   The 3{-hour movie, ``International Guerrillas,'' depicts Rushdie
as a bloodthirsty murderer of Moslems and ends with divine
retribution. In the last scene, Rushdie is killed by lightning
bolts that emanate from the Koran floating over his head.
   Distributor Mohammed Fayyaz said the film left Moslems with a
sense of satisfaction and calmed their offended feelings.
   He said if the appeal before the British Board of Film
Classification fails, he will take the case to court. In the
meantime, he will increase efforts to distribute the movie in
Europe and North America. He said the film is the most expensive
ever made in Pakistan, where ithas played to packed audiences.
   Rushdie, who supports the right of the film to be shown, has
made the same argument for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' The
book, assailed as blasphemous by some Moslems, prompted the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran to call for Rushdie's death in
February 1989.
   The author, born to a Moslem family in India and now a British
citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989.
   Fayyaz, who has a video shop in south London, called the
Punjabi-Urdu film an imaginative thriller.
   ``If you drop the name Salman Rushdie then it is just like James
Bond,'' he said.
   The film classification board has refused to allow release of
the film on the ground it was criminally libelous.
   James Ferman, chairman of the film classification board, said
the board had been advised it ``could be cited as an accessory if
we were irresponsibly to pass this video.''
   Rushdie said the film deserves the same rights as his book.
   ```The Satanic Verses' was accused of being blasphemous, it had
a judicial review and went through the British courts which decided
it wasn't blasphemous,'' said Frances D'Souza, who spoke to Rushdie
on Monday.
   ``The film should be treated in the same way. If it does
actually infringe British law then action can be taken.''
   She said censoring the film was a form of prior restraint.
   Ms. D'Souza is director of an organization which defends free
expression and is chairwoman of the International Salman Rushdie
Defense Committee.
   She said Rushdie ``unequivocally has said he would not take out
any proceedings'' against the film.
   Fayyaz said 500 pirate copies of ``International Guerrillas''
are already in Britain.

<HEAD>House Prepares For Debate Over Frank Reprimand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders and ethics committee
members geared up Monday to defend a proposed reprimand for Rep.
Barney Frank.
   However, conservative Republicans readied moves to stiffen the
punishment for the Massachusetts Democrat's actions on behalf of a
male prostitute.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said disciplinary action would
be considered Thursday against Frank, one of two admitted
homosexuals in the House.
   The 12-member ethics panel voted unanimously last week to
reprimand Frank, a punishment that would consist of a finding by
the full House that the congressman brought discredit upon the body.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., already has said, however,
that he would propose to expel Frank. That resolution would need a
two-thirds vote and appears headed for certain defeat.
   However, a number of other conservative Republicans said they
expect one of their number to propose that Frank be censured, a
step higher than a reprimand. A censure, like a reprimand, requires
a House vote condemning a member's behavior but also requires his
presence while the action is taken.
   Frank, an outspoken liberal in his fifth term, is expected to be
on the floor regardless of the punishment, because he has promised
to apologize to the House.
   ``I believe the committee position will be sustained on the
floor,'' Foley told reporters Monday.
   House Majority Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., said, ``When the
committee comes out with an overwhelmingly bipartisan report, the
membership will say `12 folks are all saying the same thing. Can
they be wrong?' Attempts at censure or expulsion will fail.''
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the ethics
panel's formal name, concluded in a report released Friday that
Frank brought discredit upon the House in two areas of his conduct
with male prostitute Stephen L. Gobie.
   The panel found he used his congressional status for dismissal
of 33 parking tickets incurred by Gobie while not on official
business. Frank said he had employed Gobie as a personal aide from
1985-87 and paid him with personal funds. The panel recommended
that Frank make restitution of an unspecified amount to the
District of Columbia for the tickets.
   The committee said also that Frank wrote a memo that wound up in
the files of a Virginia prosecutor, which made misleading
statements favorable to Gobie during his probation. Gobie had been
convicted on drug and sex charges.
   Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., said he's aware that some GOP
members are considering a censure of Frank and added he would vote
for such a proposal.
   Walker said a key factor for those favoring censure would be
Frank's initial failure to pay Social Security taxes on Gobie's
salary.
   Frank told a news conference Friday he had ``erred in apparently
not withholding Social Security taxes for Gobie. Apparently when
you have casual labor like this you're supposed to withhold Social
Security tax. I've since made those payments. There is no other tax
liability.''
   Walker said the Social Security tax payments represent ``a
serious question that merits a penalty greater than the ethics
committee's recommendation.'' He added that the misleading
statements by Frank during Gobie's probation was ``a fairly serious
offense'' because he's chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on administrative law.
   ``When you have someone in a powerful position in law
enforcement lying to law enforcement officials, that is something
we ought to be concerned about,'' Walker said.

<HEAD>House Votes to Limit TV Ads Aimed at Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Monday to limit the amount of
advertising on children's television shows, which one lawmaker
complained have become ``the equivalent of a Toys R Us catalog.''
   By a voice vote, the House approved legislation that also would
require regulators to weigh, in renewing the licenses of television
stations, how well broadcasters are serving the educational needs
of children.
   The bill and a similar measure approved by the Senate last week
would effectively reverse the Reagan administration's deregulation
of the commercial content of children's TV programming in 1984.
   Both would limit commercial advertising during children's
programming to 10{ minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an
hour on weekdays.
   Proponents claim the restrictions are necessary because many
children are unable to discriminate between ads and programs until
they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to recognize a pitch as
such until they are 7 or 8.
   The Bush administration opposes the bill, particularly the
provision requiring the FCC to review children's educational and
informational programming as part of license renewals. The Justice
Department has said it will urge President Bush to veto the bill.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimates the average
cvisions, the National Association
of Broadcasters issued a statement last week in general support of
the legislation.
   ``I think the president will sign it and I think most of the
parents will stand behind him when he does,'' said Peggy Charren,
president of Action of Children's Television, an advocacy group
behind the legislation.
   Before the bill can be sent to the White House, lawmakers still
have to settle a major difference between the House and Senate
versions.
   Going a step beyond the House, the Senate attached a measure by
Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., that would establish a $10 million
National Endowment for Children's Educational Television in the
Commerce Department.
   Wirth said the foundation is needed to ``reverse the trend of
the 1980s, which has seen commercial television broadcasters
virtually abandon their efforts at children's educational
programming.''
   Both bills would require the FCC to complete within six months
its current inquiry into so-called ``program-length commercials''
aimed at promoting toys such at GI Joe.
   Charren said there were 70 such shows _ ``in effect toy
commercials, many of them series'' _ aired by broadcasters in 1986.
   Prior to the FCC's deregulation in 1984, broadcasters had
followed industry guidelines limiting ads in children's programming
to 9{ minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on
weekdays.
   Since then, according to the House committee, advertising on
many Saturday morning children's shows has crept up to 11 minutes
an hour.

<HEAD>Soviet Immigration Prompts New `Who is a Jew?' Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli officials are debating whether to
restrict immigration laws to curb the influx of tens of thousands
of Soviet Jews who are severely taxing the country's housing market
and social services.
   The question of amending the Law of Return, or ``Who is a Jew''
law, was argued Monday on radio broadcasts and in newspapers.
   Almost two years ago, proposals to amend the law, which grants
automatic citizenship to all Jews, provoked outrage among American
Jews, who said changes would alienate conservative and reform Jews
who together form a majority of American Jewry.
   Michael Kleiner, chairman of Parliament's immigration committee,
has claimed the immigration laws are exploited by Soviet non-Jews.
   He seeks to change a 1970 amendment to the law that grants
automatic citizenship to the child, grandchild or spouse of a Jew,
as well as the spouse of his child or grandchild.
   Kleiner claims that if this ammendment is not revised it would
entitle at least 5 million Soviet non-Jews to Israeli citizenship
and immigration benefits.
   Their immigration would more than double the population of
Israel.
   Kleiner has said he wants to exclude descendants of Jewish
grandfathers, unless the family arrives with the grandfather.
   ``If this really becomes a trend and millions of non-Jews use
their Jewish grandfather to escape from the Soviet Union, this will
endanger the Jewish nature of Israel,'' Kleiner said in an
interview last week.
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, head of the government's
immigration committee, reportedly told the Cabinet Sunday he will
oppose any changes in the law because ``we are dealing with an
emergency situation with Jews running from the Soviet Union. ...
What we must do is open the gates of the homeland to the Jewish
people.''
   Legislator Uriel Lynn lashed out at Kleiner Monday.
   ``This change may divide families and create panic and anxiety
among potential immigrants. ... It has elements of racism and would
present our country as racist,'' Lynn said in an interview.
   Eugene Sukholtzky, head of the Jewish Culture Club in Baku,
Soviet Central Asia, told the Israeli daily Haaretz: ``We know
non-Jews are buying documents that they are Jewish ... and we also
have the widespread problem of mixed marriages.''
   But he added that requiring grandfathers to come to Israel could
be unfair to some immigrants ``because of the biological reason
that their grandparents are no longer alive and they have no other
proof that they are Jewish.''
   Israel's Orthodox establishment has long fought to change the
Law of Return so it conforms to Orthodox Jewish law. That law
states that a Jew is one who is born to a Jewish mother or
converted according to Orthodox Jewish law.
   This proposal enraged American Jews because it would mean all
non-Orthodox converts would be considered non-Jews in Israel.
   Interior Minister Arye Deri, a member of the Sephardic Torah
Guardian or Shas Party, has refused to comply with a Supreme Court
order to recognize non-Orthodox conversions. He now backs Kleiner's
effort to change the law.
   More than 1.2 million Soviets have requested visa applications
as Jews, according to the quasi-government Jewish Agency.
   Since 1989 74,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel and the
number is expected to reach 150,000 this year. Social services are
already overloaded and a housing shortage is fast developing.

<HEAD>Another Line Of Defense In Texas Against `Killer Bees'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another line of defense has been completed in
Texas against Africanized honeybees moving north out of Mexico
toward the United States, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said the bees have not yet entered the
United States but are expected to do so between late summer and
next spring.
   Glosser said four interconnected trap lines have been completed
in South Texas to capture and track swarms as they move north out
of Mexico.
   The bees are hybrid offspring of African bees brought to Brazil
in 1956. Some escaped and mated with native bees.
   Africanized bees can be aggressive when threatened and swarm
quickly against an intruder. This characteristic has contributed to
their notoriety as ``killer bees,'' which USDA officials blame on
horror movies and exaggerated news reports.
   ``In reality, the chances of being injured by an Africanized or
any honeybee are far less than the chances of being hit by
lightning,'' says a recent background paper on the bees.
   Glosser said the four trap lines are located north of
Brownsville, Texas, near the Gulf coast. The northernmost line has
more than 40 traps and runs about 50 miles from Sarita to
Raymondville.
   An intersecting line has about 60 traps and extends 80 miles
from La Gloria to Port Mansfield on the coast. Another with about
30 traps extends about 30 miles south of La Gloria to Rio Grande
City. The fourth, with about 60 traps, runs parallel to the coast
for about 60 miles from San Perlita to Port Isabel.

   Bush noted that Souter had won unanimous confirmation to the
appellate bench earlier this year, suggesting his hopes that the
nomination might not trigger a political free-for-all in the Senate.
   ``I look forward to a fair and expeditious confirmation
process,'' Bush said.
   Bush was asked if he knows Souter's views on abortion or other
difficult issues.
   Bush said he felt it would have been ``inappropriate'' and that
he did not ask him his views on any specific issues.
   ``Judge Souter is committed to interpreting, not making, the
law,'' Bush said.
   ``I have selected a person who will interpret the Constitution
and in my view not legislate'' from the bench, Bush said.

<HEAD>Congressman Sends $98,950 In S&amp;L Campaign Money To State Govt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Tim Wirth sent the state of Colorado a
check Monday for $98,950 _ all the money contributed to his
campaign committee by savings and loan industry figures and S&amp;L
customers who failed to repay major loans.
   The list of donors includes three key figures in the controversy
over the collapse of Silverado Banking, which was closed by federal
regulators in 1988. The president's son, Neil Bush, was a Silverado
director.
   ``Recent scandals surrounding the industry have contaminated
these contributions,'' Wirth said in a news statement. ``Therefore,
they have no place in my campaign, past, present, or future.''
   Among the donors were Ken Good, the Denver developer who
allegedly defaulted on at least $31 million in loans from
Silverado, Michael Wise, the former Silverado president, and Denver
developer Bill Walters, who allegedly defaulted on $106 million in
Silverado loans. Good donated $9,000 to Wirth; Wise, $3,100;
Walters, $3,500.
   Wise also raised money for Republican presidential candidate
George Bush in 1987 by helping sponsor a dinner for Bush that
reportedly brought in $300,000 in contributions. The president's
son, Denver oilman Neil Bush, was a Silverado director from 1985 to
1988 when Wise was the thrift's president.
   Wise also raised money for Republican presidential candidate
George Bush in 1987 by helping sponsor a fund-raising dinner that
reportedly brought in $300,000.
   The Colorado Democrat said the check to the state Department of
Revenue represents all contributions made by these parties to the
Wirth Campaign Committee since 1980.
   Dorothy Dahlquist, a spokeswoman for the revenue department,
said officials had yet to decide if the money would go into the
general fund or used for a specific purpose.
   ``At the time these contributions were made, which over the
years have comprised less than 2 percent of all monies raised,
there was no reason to suspect any wrongdoing,'' Wirth said.
   ``On the contrary, these donors were well-recognized as leaders
of their communities, precisely the kinds of people from whom
anyone seeking public office would hope to solicit political and
financial support.''
   But he said the S&amp;L scandal has changed his opinion of those
contributors.
   ``By its magnitude, persistence and unfairness, the S&amp;L scandal
has shaken public trust in government,'' said Wirth. ``Coloradans
are angry, and I share their anger.
   ``A relative handful of greedy and unprincipled individuals,
using the tools of an unregulated industry in an overly permissive
financial environment, have ripped off millions of Americans,'' he
said. ``The guilty parties must be brought to justice; our
financial institutions must again be made safe and sound, and
perhaps most important, the pact between people and their
institutions of self-government must be reconfirmed.''
   The list of Wirth campaign contributors whose money was turned
over to the state showed $22,650 from people affiliated with
Columbia Savings and Loan of Beverly Hills, Calif. and $11,000 from
figures linked to the bankrupt American Continental Corp. of
Arizona, both of which have battled federal regulators.
   Also listed was $8,700 from the U.S. League of Savings
Associations PAC, and $8,250 from donors affiliated with Mercury
Savings of Huntington Beach, Calif. The other returned
contributions were for amounts $5,000 or less.

   An abortion clinic operator was charged
with breach of peace after he allegedly threw horse manure at
anti-abortion protesters demonstrating near his home, police said.
   Dr. Steven G. Kaali, 47, who operates Women's Medical Pavillion
in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., was released on his own recognizance after
his arrest Saturday. He is scheduled to appear July 30 in Stamford
Superior Court.
   Police said six protesters had completed a brief march near
Kaali's secluded estate in Greenwich when a man identified as Kaali
threw a bucket of horse manure at them.
   The protesters had earlier participated with about 70 others in
a march through downtown Greenwich. The march was the third in as
many weeks.
   One protester said she was struck by the manure.
   ``I was so humiliated. I was in shock,'' said Carol Centonze,
50, of Yonkers, N.Y.
   Women's Medical Pavillion has been a regular target for protests
during the past two years, according to Dobbs Ferry police.

   oil futures contract hasn't been that high since April, traders
said.
   Ministers from the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are scheduled to meet Thursday.
   ``The market is simply gaining more and more confidence that
OPEC is going to come up with a viable settlement here,'' said Bob
Baker, who follows the energy futures markets for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Baker said crude oil prices have been rising for the past 12
sessions, since the September contract for West Texas intermediate
was trading at below $17 a barrel.
   Robert Murphy, vice president in the international energy
futures group at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said that as the OPEC
meeting approaches, ``the more it looks likely they are going to
keep their promise of last week.''
   He said traders are anticipating OPEC will cut its production to
22.5 million barrels a day from current production of more than 23
million barrels.
   But he warned that there is still a glut in the U.S. oil
inventory, and that ``you never know how inventory figures (to be

   Prices for refined products traded on the Merc also rose, taking
their cues from movements in the crude contracts.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery rose 0.39 cent to
63.35 cents a gallon, while later contract months up by similar
amounts.
   The August contract for home heating oil rose 0.71 cent to close
at 56.50 cents a gallon, with subsequent months up even more.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract closed at $1.460
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.482 Friday.

<HEAD>Survey: Seattle Motorists Burning Dirtiest Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists in Seattle are burning the dirtiest
gasoline, according to a consumer survey released Monday that also
said Chevron brands nationwide contain on average the most
cancer-causing benzene.
   The survey found widely different levels of toxic aromatics,
especially benzene, in gasoline depending on regions of the
country. Premium gasoline sold in Miami contained a third as much
benzene as the same gasoline sold in Seattle.
   Earl Ross, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said
such variations weren't unusual.
   ``Gasolines are blended differently for different parts of the
country'' because of differences in driving conditions, climate,
altitude and seasonal changes, he said.
   Benzene and other so-called ``aromatic'' additives, which are
used to boost gasoline octane, are highly toxic and can cause
cancer, studies have indicated. Clean-air legislation before
Congress would require significant reductions in the use of those
additives by refiners.
   Health specialists are concerned primarily about exposure to the
toxic vapors during refueling, although the petroleum industry has
said such exposure is at such low levels that it does not warrant a
health concern.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that there are
about eight chances in 100,000 of a person developing cancer from
self-service refueling of motor vehicles over a lifetime. The EPA
said the risk is greater for those who live near or work at
gasoline stations, terminals or refineries.
   The survey of gasoline sold in 18 metropolitan areas was
produced by Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer and
environmental group, and was based on fuel samples tested annually
by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
   The American Petroleum Institute accused Citizen Action of
``misusing data ... to present an unduly alarmist picture of the
health risks'' to motorists.
   The Citizens Action study showed that premium gasoline sold in
the West generally contained higher levels of aromatics, including
benzene. An exception appeared to be Atlanta, where the level of
benzene in premium gasoline (2.9 percent) was second only to
Seattle (3 percent).
   Shell premium gasoline sold in Atlanta had the highest benzene
content of any gasoline tested, or 5.4 percent. Shell in recent
months has touted the benefits of clean gasoline when promoting its
reformulated premium SU-2000E brand.
   But other gasoline brands in other cities also showed high
levels of benzene. Exxon's premium in Los Angeles and Chevron's
premium in San Francisco contained more than 3.6 percent benzene.
   ``This is gasoline at its dirtiest,'' said Edwin Rothschild,
energy policy director for Citizen Action.
   By comparison, the average benzene content in gasoline is
slightly more than 2 percent. Clean-air legislation in the final
stages of being approved by Congress calls for refiners to limit
their benzene levels to less than 1 percent and overall aromatic
levels to 25 percent.
   The Citizen Action survey showed that some gasoline brands
already meet the anticipated clean-air requirement.
   In Miami, where average benzene levels in premium gasoline were
only 1 percent, Mobil's premium had a benzene level of one-half of
1 percent and three other brands _ Union, Amoco and Exxon _ all
contained well below 1 percent benzene. Premium brands from Exxon,
Amoco and Texaco had similar levels in Dallas, Washington D.C., and
Denver.
   ``Obviously oil companies are capable of manufacturing premium
unleaded gasoline with less than 0.8 percent benzene,'' Rothschild
said at a news conference.
   Gasoline from the same company can have widely different levels
of benzene depending on region and type of gas, the survey showed.
For example, while Texaco sold premium gasoline with 0.67 percent
benzene in Denver, its regular gasoline sold in Boston had nearly 5
percent benzene content.
   Rothschild said the controversial additives should be eliminated.
   ``We are appalled that companies like Chevron and Shell have the
audacity to tell the public that they sell quality gasoline when in
many cities they are the purveyors of the most toxic gasoline on
the market,'' he said.

   Marlon Brando listened solemnly in court
Monday while witnesses described the night a shot rang out at the
actor's mansion and his son Christian was arrested for shooting his
sister's boyfriend.
   ``I didn't mean to shoot him,'' Christian Brando was quoted as
telling the first police officer who reached the gated estate where
26-year-old Dag Drollet had died.
   ``He (Christian Brando) said he didn't care for the guy a whole
lot, but he didn't want the guy killed,'' recalled Los Angeles
police officer Steve Cunningham. ``He didn't want anybody to be
shot.''
   Cunningham testified as a preliminary hearing opened. Municipal
Court Judge Larry Fidler will decide at hearing's end whether there
is sufficient evidence to have the actor's son stand trial for
murder and a weapons violation.
   Marlon Brando sat in the front row of the jammed courtroom,
occasionally taking notes.
   Christian, 32, appeared nervous when he was led into the jammed
courtroom where some spectators had to stand after all seats were
filled. Reporters, camera crews and movie fans crowded the hallways.
   The prosecution dismissed one charge, possession of a silencer.
   Cunningham told of driving to Brando's Mulholland Drive estate
on May 16.
   At the gate, Cunningham said he saw paramedics and firefighters
and ``I was told there was a guy in the house that had been shot in
the head and he was dead and the suspect was still in the house.''
   He added later: ``I was told by a fireman the son did it.'' ''
   Cunningham said Marlon Brando opened the door and the officer
asked where to find his son.
   ``He said, `I don't have any idea where he is and I can't
believe he shot him.'''
   Cunningham said he went into the living room and found Christian
Brando and his sister, Cheyenne, seated on the floor. ``He was
sitting on the floor with his arms around her shoulder. She
appeared to be upset,'' said Cunningham. ``... I could not hear her
crying but I remember she had tears on her face.''
   Cheyenne Brando was then seven months pregnant with Drollet's
child. She recently gave birth to a boy in Tahiti where the Brandos
have a home. She is said to be suffering from exhaustion, and a
doctor told authorities she could not return to testify.
   Cunningham said young Brando spoke before he was asked anything.
   ``I got approximately 3 to 5 feet from the defendant and he
stated he didn't mean to shoot him,'' Cunningham said. ``At that
time, I arrested him.''
   After being handcuffed, Brando continued explaining.
   ``All of a sudden he just started talking,'' Cunningham said.
``He stated that it was an accident, that they were struggling over
the gun, wrestling around over the gun, that the deceased grabbed
his hand and that made the gun go off.''
   The defense contends the .45-caliber handgun went off
accidentally during a scuffle over the weapon between the 6-foot
Brando and the 6-foot-3 Drollet.
   Prosecutors say they found no evidence of a struggle and that
Drollet was shot while sitting on a sofa, holding a cigarette
lighter in one hand and a television remote control in the other.
   Cunningham said the younger Brando said he had been out to
dinner with his sister ``and when they got back to Mulholland Drive
things got crazy and the deceased went nuts.''
   Under cross-examination by Brando's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro,
Cunningham said Christian also told him Drollet was fighting with
Cheyenne and that Christian told Drollet: ``Leave my sister alone.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Indian Prime
Minister V.P. Singh pledged Monday to work toward building a
nuclear-free and non-violent world, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency said a joint statement spoke of
the two countries' commitment to disarmament and the replacement of
confrontation and force with peace through reason. But the account
of the statement they signed in the Kremlin did not touch on
economic issues.
   Indian officials had said a major Singh goal during the trip was
to protect India's trade relationship with the Soviet Union, now
based on barter and ruble-rupee parity. This could be undercut by
Moscow's plans to make the ruble convertible.
   In dinner speeches, Gorbachev and Singh praised their two
countries' cooperation. Singh cited Gorbachev's ``courage and
visionary thinking'' and Gorbachev thanked India for its support
for perestroika, his reform program.
   Singh arrived on Monday and was met at the airport by Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. The visit is his first here since he took
office last December. Before leaving New Delhi, he told reporters
he hoped to establish a personal rapport with Gorbachev.
   ``We now have a fruitful cooperation in the economy and I am
certain that new opportunities, ways and forms of cooperation will
open up,'' Singh said in an interview with Tass before leaving New
Delhi. ``I will give priority to this question during my visit.''
   Singh's talks with Gorbachev were expected to focus on India's
deep economic and military ties with the Soviet Union, which Indian
newspaper said could be threatened by the Soviet Union's turn to
the West.
   Oleg Bostorin, head of the Directorate for South Asian
Countries, told Tass Singh's visit ``refutes the allegation, made
recently in some circles, that the Soviet Union has lost interest
in India, and in the Third World as a whole.''
   Indian-Soviet trade, worth about $4 billion a year, has been to
India's advantage in recent years. India bought military hardware
and oil on favorable terms, and sold rice and other commodities at
prices higher than those on the world market.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Kindinger will
instruct senior military officers and civilians ``on the importance
of agriculture in the global community and for our national
security.''
   Yeutter said Kindinger will join the college on Tuesday and will

   Kindinger was raised on a farm in Reading, Mich., and holds
degrees, including a doctorate, in agricultural economics. Before
joining USDA last year, he had been Michigan state director of
agriculture since 1983.

   Filmmaker Spike Lee has opened a store called
Spike's Joint, and it features products from four of Lee's films
and merchandise from his ``Is it the shoes?'' sneaker ads.
   ``I think we're making a very important statement that we black
people have to start building and owning our own businesses,'' Lee
said at the Brooklyn store's opening Sunday.
   Franchised Spike's Joints may open in the next year in Los
Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago.
   Publicist Pedro Barry said Monday the goods in the store are
what ``the public is asking us to produce.''
   ``We got letters and telephone calls everyday asking for these
things,'' he said.
   In the last two years, the merchandise was distributed from
Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks, Lee's production company, also in
Brooklyn.
   Lee, acclaimed for his film ``Do The Right Thing,'' bristled
when a reporter suggested that some of the money might be funneled
back to the community.
   ``When white people start a business no one says a word. Black
people want to make some money, it's `So Spike, are you going to
give all your money back to the community?''' he mocked.
   Lee said he is interested in making money because he would like
to finance his own movies.
   His first mass-distributed movie, ``She's Gotta Have It,'' was
made for only $175,000 in 1986.
   Now, though, he relies on studio money to finance movies,
including the $10 million it cost to produce the soon-to-open ``Mo'
Better Blues.''

   President Bush said Monday he will nominate
appellate judge David Souter to a seat on the Supreme Court. If
confirmed by the Senate, the 50-year-old jurist from New Hampshire
would succeed William J. Brennan.
   ``He is a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest
ability,'' Bush said. The president went on to praise Brennan as
well, calling the court's long-time leading liberal, ``one of the
greatest figures of his age.'' Brennan resigned last Friday.
   Souter stood at Bush's side as the president made his surprise
announcement at the White House late in the afternoon. The
president said he decided on Souter earlier in the afternoon.
   Bush said his quick selection was not geared to abortion policy
or any other single issue. ``It is not appropriate ... to use any
litmus test,'' Bush said. Abortion activists believe Brennan's
departure from the court could pave the way for overturning the
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   ``I hope you will understand that I think I must defer any
comments'' on court issues, Souter said, until Senate confirmation
hearings begin. He said it would take him all night to describe
what an honor Bush had conferred on him.
   The nomination now goes to the Senate where a simple majority is
required for confirmation.
   Souter was appointed by Bush earlier this year to the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. Previously, he was a member of the New
Hampshire State Supreme Court, appointed to that post in 1983 by
then-Gov. John Sununu, now Bush's chief of staff. Souter succeeded
Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., as the state's attorney general.
   Brennan, 84, one of the most liberal members of an increasingly
conservative court and one of the most influential justices of the
20th century, told Bush on Friday that he was resigning because of
declining health.
   He had served on the high court for 34 years. He was appointed
by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Brennan's health started to deteriorate in the last year. He
recently fell at the Newark International Airport and struck his
head, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said, and after consulting with
his doctors he decided to step down.
   Bush acted with unusual speed in making his choice.
   He met twice over the weekend with his top lieutenants and
called the Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress to seek
advice.
   Bush noted that Souter had won unanimous confirmation to the
appellate bench earlier this year, suggesting his hopes that the
nomination might not trigger a political free-for-all in the Senate.
   ``We're not bracing for some horrendous fight with the United
States Senate,'' Bush said.
   ``I look forward to a fair and expeditious confirmation
process.''
   Bush was asked if he knows Souter's views on abortion or other
difficult issues.
   Bush said he felt it would have been ``inappropriate'' and that
he did not ask him his views on any specific issues.
   ``Judge Souter is committed to interpreting, not making, the
law,'' Bush said.
   ``I have selected a person who will interpret the Constitution
and in my view not legislate'' from the bench, Bush said.
   A questioner noted that Bush and Sununu both have widely known
views against abortion and asked why people shouldn't think that
Souter's abortion view was known to Bush through research or some
other method.
   ``I told you it's not,'' Bush said.
   ``Most of his writings have been at the state level,'' Bush said
of Souter's judicial record, indicating that his views on such
tough federal issues as affirmative action or free speech might not
be well developed.
   In a 1986 case before the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Souter
ruled with the majority that doctors have a responsibility to test
for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of
abortion.
   ``We recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves
controversial and divisive social issues,'' said the opinion.
``Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that
a woman has a constitutionally secured right to terminate a
pregnancy.''
   In a concurring opinion, Souter questioned the impact the
decision would have on doctors who didn't support abortion. ``The
court does not hold that some or all physicians must make a choice
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures,'' he
wrote.
   Bush brushed off a question about the possibility of a
liberal-vs-conservative confirmation battle, saying, ``I don't
control the Senate.''
   He said he did not view the Brennan vacancy _ or the prospect of
replacing others among the elderly cast on the nine-member court _
as an opportunity to put ``some personal Bush imprint'' on the
court.
   ``I'm not interested in having this known as a Bush court,'' the
president said.
   Bush said the process of screening candidates for a potential
vacancy had been going on for some time, but not with Brennan in
mind. He said White House counsel Boyden Gray had played a key role
in the preliminary research and at one point he denied that Sununu
had played an undue role in the process that ended with Souter's
selection.
   ``It's a process that has been going on for some time and the
excellence was just there,'' Bush said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
announcement Monday of his intention to nominate David Souter to
the Supreme Court.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   My oath to the Constitution charges me to faithfully execute the
Office of President, and to the best of my ability preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Few
duties are more important in discharging that obligation than my
responsibility under Article 2, Section 2 of our Constitution to
select from among all possible choices one nominee to fill a
vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States.
   The task of narrowing the selection to one highly qualified
jurist committed to the rule of law and faithful to the
Constitution could never be easy, but I have found it enormous _
enormously satisfying. My choice will serve the Court and the
Constitution well.
   I am most pleased to announce that I will nominate as associate
justice of the United States Supreme Court a remarkable judge of
keen intellect and the highest ability, one whose scholarly
commitment to the law and whose wealth of experience mark him of
first rank _ Judge David Souter of the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit.
   Judge Souter, I believe with all my heart, will prove a most
worthy member of the court. His tenure as an associate justice of
the Supreme Court of the state of New Hampshire, as attorney
general of that state, and more recently as a federal appeals
judge, unquestionably demonstrates his ability, his integrity, and
his dedication to public service. And he has a keen appreciation of
the proper judicial role rooted in fundamental belief and
separation of powers and the democratic principles underlying our
great system of government.
   Let me pay tribute, too, to the justice whose retirement from
the court created the vacancy, Justice William Brennan. His
powerful intellect, his winning personality, and importantly his
commitment to civil discourse on emotional issues that at times
tempt uncivil voices have made him one of the greatest figures of
our age.
   No one can question his dedication to the nation and the energy
that he has brought to his high office. His retirement is marked by
the dignity and honor that characterized his 34 years of service on
the bench. And I told him the other day when I talked to him of the
respect that Mrs. Bush and I have for him for his wonderful service.
   In choosing to nominate Judge Souter, who like Justice Brennan
is largely a product of the state court system, I have looked for
the same dedication to public service and strength of intellect
exemplified by Justice Brennan.
   My selection process was not geared simply to any legal issue.
It is not appropriate in choosing a Supreme Court justice to use
any litmus test. And I want a justice who will ably and fairly
interpret the law across the range of issues the Court faces. Our
country serves as a model for the world at a time of special
significance, and I stressed within the White House to the attorney
general that our process could not be dominated by politics or
special interests. And I believe that we've set a good example of
selecting a fair arbiter of the law.
   Judge Souter will bring to the Court a wealth of judicial
experience on the Supreme Court of his state and, before that, as a
state trial court judge. Prior to his appointment to the state
bench, he was attorney general of the state of New Hampshire.
   Judge Souter is a graduate of the Harvard Law School, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of Harvard College. He was also a Rhodes Scholar.
   My respect for his outstanding record led me earlier this year
to nominate him to his present position on the court of appeals.
The Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position because of
his exceptional qualities and his experience.
   His opinions reflect a clean intellect _ keen intellect as well
as wise balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of
the law. Judge Souter committed to interpreting, not making the
law. He recognizes the proper role of judges in upholding the
democratic choices of the people through their elected
representatives with constitutional constraints.
   Judge Brennan's retirement took effect last Friday. The Court is
now reduced to eight members. It is important to restore the bench
to full strength by the first Monday in October when the Court
begins its 1990 term. I look forward to presenting Judge Souter's
nomination to the Senate as quickly as possible, and I look forward
as well to a fair and expeditious confirmation process.

<HEAD>Parliament Asks Supreme Soviet to Condemn 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Monday urged the Soviet
Union to condemn and declare illegal the Soviet military
intervention that quashed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising, the
state MTI news agency reported.
   In a resolution addressed to Soviet lawmakers, Hungarian
deputies said the ``military intervention in 1956 was a violation
of (Hungary's) sovereignty and a grave crime against the Hungarian
people.''
   ``The Hungarian National Assembly calls on the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) to adopt a resolution declaring illegal the 1956
Soviet intervention in Hungary similar to its reassessment of the
August 1968 events in Czechoslovakia.''
   The 1968 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in Czechoslovakia
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement. Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has criticized the intervention.
   ``Such a move would strengthen the Soviet Union's commitment to
respect the sovereignty and independence of the Hungarian republic
and would contribute to the creation of genuine friendship between
our peoples,'' the resolution said.
   In a reversal of official policy, Hungary last year
rehabilitated former Premier Imre Nagy who led the failed
anti-Stalinist uprising. Nagy's remains were formally reburied at
an officially-sanctioned ceremony in the same plot where his body
and those of his associates were dumped by Moscow-subservient
Communists in unmarked graves in 1958.
   The revolt broke out Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for
political reforms and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary.
Soviet troops and tanks struck at Budapest on Nov. 4, 1956, to end
the uprising.
   Official figures put the dead at 5,000 to 6,000, but according
to Western estimates up to 32,000 people died.

<HEAD>Paraguay's Foreign Minister Fired for Political Comments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Andres Rodriguez fired
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana on Monday after Argana set off a
political uproar by saying he was ready to go to extremes if it
meant keeping the Colorado Party in power.
   Argana, 57, the interim party president, announced his dismissal
himself. He told a news conference Gen. Rodriguez ``asked that I
leave the foreign minister's post and dedicate myself totally to
the Colorado Party. ... So I am leaving the post immediately.''
   He had been foreign minister since Feb. 3, 1989, the day
Rodriguez ousted the 34-year regime of former President Alfredo
Stroessner in a violent coup.
   Argana, who was closely associated with the Stroessner regime,
said comments he made last Friday ``were badly interpreted, but
that is normal in politics.''
   ``I said that we (the Colorado Party) would be willing to
conspire and to make a revolution as a reply to a threat issued
last May by leaders of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party,'' he
said.
   He accused that party's leaders of saying at a party meeting
that ``it will be necessary to use clubs to knock the Colorados
from power.''
   The Authentic Radical Liberals are Paraguay's largest opposition
party. Banned under Stroessner, it was recognized by the Rodriguez
government and is organizing an effort to win scheduled 1991
municipal elections and national elections set for 1993.
   The Colorado Party, in power since 1947, supported Gen.
Stroessner. It now is split into factions, including an
``orthodox'' group led by Argana and containing many people who
allied themselves with Stroessner, and a ``democratic'' group that
favors party democratization.

   Marion Barry's lawyers Monday attacked the
credibility of an admitted cocaine dealer who said she delivered
crack to the mayor at a municipal office in 1988.
   Barry's lawyers said at his cocaine and perjury trial that the
mayor has an alibi for the time of the alleged delivery Sept. 7,
1988. Prosecutors contend Barry's alibi is non-existent.
   Testifying for the defense, city employee Clifton Roberson said
he accepted a job application from Lydia Pearson on Sept. 7, 1988.
   Pearson testified earlier in Barry's trial that she handed the
mayor ``crack cocaine. ... He gave me the money for it. ... I gave
him'' the job application.
   Roberson, who works for mayoral aide Anita Bonds, said Pearson
came to the office on Sept. 7, 1988, and was annoyed that neither
Barry nor Bonds was there. Roberson said he accepted the job
application from Pearson, who then left.
   Roberson said on cross-examination by prosecutors that he had no
idea whether Pearson might have met with Barry after leaving the
office.
   Earlier, defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy suggested that the
mayor has an alibi for the time the government alleges Pearson was
bringing him crack cocaine.
   A former city aide and the city fire chief testified that the
mayor was addressing problems involving ambulance service in the
District of Columbia on the morning of Sept. 7, 1988.
   The building where the crack delivery allegedly occurred is
about five blocks from fire department headquarters where the
meeting on ambulance problems was held.
   Barry was in the scheduled 10 a.m. meeting until nearly noon
that day, Joseph Yeldell, former director of the office of
emergency preparedness, said under questioning from Mundy.
   But Barry was late to the meeting, Yeldell said.
   How late, asked Mundy.
   ``I can't be specific,'' said Yeldell, but ``a slight delay of
the meeting'' resulted from Barry's tardiness.
   Fire chief Ray Alfred said he was uncertain whether Barry got to
the meeting on time.
   Yeldell said Barry was in the meeting for as much as an hour and
20 minutes. Alfred said Barry spoke for about an hour, possibly an
hour and a half.
   The meeting is videotaped and a clock on the wall shows that
Barry left the room eight or nine minutes before noon, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin. The clock isn't visible
when Barry walks in, she indicated.
   In the videotape, Barry apologizes for being late and says he
has been delayed by the opening of a new supermarket, said Retchin.
She said prosecutors plan to show the videotape in its rebuttal
case after Mundy concludes the defense case.
   Pearson's testimony for Sept. 7, 1988, forms the basis for one
of 10 cocaine possession charges to which Barry has pleaded
innocent. Barry also has pleaded innocent to one count of
conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury.

   The Bush administration has told manufacturers
of six semiautomatic assault-style rifles banned from import last
summer that new, revised versions of the weapons conform to U.S.
laws, officials said Monday.
   ``We have approved prototypes and said, `If you manufacture this
weapon for import, it would be approved,''' said Jack Killorin,
spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The bureau was not immediately aware of whether the
manufacturers or importers of such weapons as the Uzi carbine and
the AK-47 had sought permits to bring in any of the new weapons, he
said. Since the new designs lack the military-style hardware of the
banned weapons, gun fanciers may not want them and the
manufacturers may decide not to bother producing them, he said.
   ``They have to ask whether what we're asking for is a marketable
item,'' Killorin said.
   The Bush administration last summer banned from import 43 types
of semiautomatic assault-style rifles. That ban followed an outcry
over the January 1989 slayings of five elementary school children
in Stockton, Calif., by a transient wielding an AK-47. In addition,
law enforcement officials had complained that the weapons were
extremely popular among drug dealers.
   The ATF justified the ban by saying the weapons did not meet the
legal requirement that imported rifles be suitable for sporting
purposes.
   The banned guns had such military-style characteristics as
threaded barrels for silencers; flash suppressors that could hide
the shooter's position at night; bayonet lugs; folding or
collapsible stocks; pistol grips; and large capacity ammunition
magazines.
   Receiving approval for new versions of banned weapons were the
makers of the Uzi carbine, AK-47, Galil, HK-91, SAR-8, and
SAR-4800, according to documents obtained by the Firearms Policy
Project through the Freedom of Information Act. The Washington Post
reported on the issue in Monday's editions.
   Killorin said the proposed weapons have different designs as
well as numerical designations.
   ``The prototypes that we're looking at are weapons that have
none of the accoutrements, not even the pistol grip,'' Killorin
said. ``The bottom line is, if the firearms conform to the changes
required, without bayonet lugs, without flash suppressors, night
sites, pistol grips and large-capacity detachable magazines, then
we're talking about a weapon consistent with semiautomatic sporting
weapons.''
   Under the regulations, ATF must approve the weapons, he said.
   But a Firearms Policy Project official responded, ``Although
these weapons may look less threatening, they are no less deadly''
than those banned from import last year.
   ``The industry knows this, ATF knows this and criminals know
this,'' Josh Sugarmann said.
   And Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said, ``We are either
going to keep these weapons of war off our streets or we are not.
This is no area for halfhearted nonsense.''
   Although the new designs do not include pistol grips _ which
give the shooter control while firing from the hip or while firing
one-handed _ some have a thumb hole in the stock, which Sugarmann
said can serve as a pistol grip.
   In addition, Sugarmann said, the rifles still can accept
large-capacity magazines even if they are fitted with limited
capacity magazines. That is true of every firearm that accepts a
detachable magazine, according to Killorin.
   An administration official, speaking on condition that he not be
identified, said purchasers of the new-style weapons could adapt
them to add the prohibited features. He said such features would be
prohibited by federal law under a crime bill now pending in
Congress.
   ``We look forward to signing that crime bill,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Killorin said the ATF has rejected prototypes submitted by three
manufacturers of banned guns.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: confirmation process.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Did you ask Judge Souter his views on abortion? Do you know
what his views are? And affirmative action? All of these things
that have become so controversial, the major issues of the day?
   Bush: No. And I had one meeting with Judge Souter. I was very
impressed but, in my view, it would have been inappropriate to ask
him his views on specific issues. This process has been going on,
this selection process, not with any specific seat in mind, but
just being prepared for a long, long time. Judge Souter was
considered for the High Court back when Mr. Justice Kennedy was
selected. And so there's a lot _ and then, of course, his name was
very much in the forefront when he was nominated and subsequently
confirmed for the Appeals Court.
   So I am familiar with him, with his, his general views, but I
did not and would not, as I think I've said before when I talked
about _ not just here, but other times _ the litmus test approach.
I wouldn't go into that with him.
   Q: Does that mean you do not care what he thinks on the ...
   Bush: It means that I have selected a person who will interpret
the Constitution and, in my view, not legislate from the federal
bench.
   Q: Mr. President, barely three days have passed since you
learned of Justice Brennan's resignation. Why did you move so
quickly on this appointment? And you also called the leaders of
Congress, and others, over the weekend for their advice. When did
you come to the choice of Justice Souter?
   Bush: I came to the choice this afternoon and wanted to _ I
think I told the leaders that I talked to over the weekend that I
wanted to move very fast. As I said, this isn't precipitous in the
sense that we just started looking for names last Saturday. I
remember meeting with the Attorney General and Boyden Gray, perhaps
within the first month I was President _ at least the first two
months. And I've had a couple of meetings with them, and they've
been in discussion with each other for a long time on this. And so
just the prudence would dictate that one be prepared lest there be
a vacancy. So we've been talking about who I might want to appoint
for a long time.
   Q: Sir, if I could follow up, you're not certain in your own
mind how Justice Souter will vote if Roe v. Wade comes before the
Court next term?
   Bush: What I'm certain of is that he will interpret the
Constitution and not legislate from the federal bench.
   Yes?
   Q: But, Mr. President, I believe Judge Souter is about 50 years
old, and many of the candidates you considered were younger than
the current justices. What kind of lasting legacy do you want to
leave on the Supreme Court? Do you expect this to be a long-term
shifting of the center of balance for the Court?
   Bush: I'm not looking _ he's in good health. I was looking over
there to see how he's looking at 50 _ but he seems to be in very
vigorous health, and I would expect he'd serve a long term on the
bench. And I'm not viewing this as some personal ``Bush imprint''
on the Court. I have pledged to get, to seek out excellence, and
I've pledged to look for somebody who would interpret the
Constitution, and I'm satisfied I've found the very best in that
regard.
   Q: Do you expect the Court would shift to the right
philosophically?
   Bush: I haven't put it in terms of shifting left or right. I
read a great deal of speculation about all that, but all I'm saying
is that we've got a nominee here who is extraordinarily
intelligent, has a record, has been confirmed by the Senate, and
who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level as to his
objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy. And I am satisfied
as to all those counts.
   Q: Mr. President, as you know, the whole issue of abortion has _
over this choice is major ... Do you know if this judge has written
on this issue? Has _ is he _ does he have a record on this issue
that either side can point to to make it an even bigger issue? Or
is he _ is it unknown and therefore more difficult to get at?
   Bush: In the first place, I think it would be inappropriate,
although I'll let him make up his own mind for Justice Souter to
make any comments on any specific issue. Out of the respect for the
Senate, I would urge that he not do that. Any specific questions on
specific issues should be addressed in an orderly confirmation
process by the Senate. But, beyond that, Leslye, I _ you know, I
think what I said earlier responds to your question.
   Q: No, I _ you said you hadn't asked him, but I wonder if he has
a record, if ...
   Bush: Well, I don't know about that. I didn't consider that, as
I thought I made clear. Yeah, Jerry? And then ...
   Q: Mr. President, since you concluded that it's inappropriate to
ask about a specific case like Roe versus Wade, do you also
therefore consider it to be inappropriate for the Senate committee
that'll do the confirmation to ask about a specific case like that?
   Bush: I would let the Senate do whatever they want. They're a
separate and independent body of the _ of our government, and there
are certain precedents for how they approach these issues, but I'm
_ listen, I've got enough problems down here without trying to tell
the Senate how to conduct its confirmation hearing. I've been
handed a protocol note. Marlin Fitzwater, who's not known for his
protocol, but I _ he says it would be most appropriate to let Judge
Souter respond at this juncture. So, with your permission, we'll
proceed.
   Judge Souter: Thank you, Mr. President. I'm really not sure how
to do that. If it were possible for me to express to you the
realization that I have of the honor which the President has just
done me, I would try and I would keep you here as long tonight as I
had to do to get it out. But I could not express that realization
and I'm not going to try to do the impossible. Beyond that, I hope
you will understand that I think I must defer any further comments
of mine until I am before the Senate in the confirmation process.

<HEAD>Thousands Flee Fighting Between Rival Shiite Factions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem forces on Monday
reinforced their front lines around a strategic mountain-top town
in southern Lebanon, as thousands of civilians took advantage of a
lull in the fighting to flee.
   Police reported a marked decrease in fighting between fighters
of the pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Syrian-backed Amal militia.
   The lull occurred as the battle between the rival Shiite
factions for control of the strategic town of Jarjou and nearby
villages close to Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon entered its second week.
   Police said a Syrian combatant was killed and two Amal
militiamen were wounded in daylong, sporadic exchanges of artillery
and sniper fire.
   The dead fighter was identified by police as a Syrian who
belonged to the Damascus-based Arab Baath Socialist Party. About
200 Baathists and a symbolic force of the Syrian Social Nationalist
Party have been fighting alongside the Amal militia.
   Israeli jets made repeated reconnaissance flights Monday over
southern Lebanon to monitor the Shiite fighting, police said.
   Monday's casualties raised the toll to 126 people killed and 369
wounded since the Shiite fighting broke out anew on July 16.
   The fighting began when Hezbollah attacked and seized Jarjou
from Amal in an effort to expand its area of control toward the
Mediterranean and open up a badly needed sea route to Iran, its
main supplier of arms.
   It was the latest round of fighting in a 3-year-old intermittent
conflict between Amal and Hezbollah for mastery of the country's
1.2 million Shiite Moslems, who make up Lebanon's largest sect.
   At least 1,167 people have been killed and 4,011 wounded in the
inconclusive power struggle, by police count.
   Police said Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas,
stationed between the Amal and Hezbollah forces in the disputed
region, occupied four new hilltop positions west of Jarjou on
Sunday.
   ``The Palestinian force is now capable of preventing any advance
from either side against each other,'' said Lt. Col. Anwar Madi,
commander of the PLO intervention force, as he inspected his
positions around Jarjou Monday.
   PLO fighters, mainly from Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, have
been trying to stop the fighting between the two Shiite groups,
apparently to halt the Hezbollah advance toward Sidon, a southern
port where Palestinian guerrillas are based. It is 10 miles
northwest of Jarjou.
   Amal and PLO guerrillas fought a three-year war in Lebanon
between 1985 and 1988, but have joined together in attacks aimed at
driving the Hezbollah forces out of Jarjou.
   Police said Amal rushed in 1,000 more militiamen with dozens of
truckloads of ammunition to its positions around Jarjou over the
weekend. Amal already had about 6,500 front-line fighters in Iqlim
al-Tuffah, or the Apple Province, where the fighting is raging.
   Hezbollah set up several additional artillery and mortar
batteries in Jarjou, police said. The fundamentalist group has
fielded at least 2,000 fighters in the province.
   The reinforcements caused panic among the region's remaining
25,000 inhabitants who fear the fighting might intensify.
   Long lines of fleeing villagers trudged through the rugged
hills, carrying their household belongings under their arms and on
their heads.
   Most of them sought refuge in southern Lebanon's major cities of
Sidon, Tyre and Nabatiyeh. Others fled to open fields, sleeping at
night in cars.

   About 150,000 people took part in a
funeral procession Monday to pay their respects to former Bulgarian
Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov, whose remains were removed from
his mausoleum last week.
   The remains of Dimitrov, revered as national hero during four
decades of Communist rule, were cremated after being transferred
from the mausoleum in downtown Sofia.
   Both the opposition and some members of the ruling Socialist
Party had called for removing Dimitrov's remains and converting the
mausoleum to other uses. Critics argue the mausoleum is a relic of
the past out of step with the country's recent push toward
democracy.
   The mostly elderly crowd _ many of whom had come from the
countryside _ walked about three miles in the funeral procession
from a square in front of Alexander Nevski Cathedral to Sofia's
central cemetery, where a memorial ceremony was held.
   The observances were organized by the Socialists, the reform
party created from the old Communist Party.
   As the funeral procession passed through the streets of the
capital, some young people on the sidewalks whistled in apparent
disapproval. No incidents were reported.
   Addressing the crowd at the funeral ceremony, Alexander Lilov,
the Socialist Party leader, appealed to party members to close
their ranks ``on the way to radical renewal and reform.''
   ``Let's transform the Bulgarian Socialist Party into a model of
a modern left-wing party,'' Lilov said.
   Lilov said the removal of Dimitrov's remains and their burial at
a public cemetery did not represent any major historical revision
regarding the country's first Communist leader, the state BTA news
agency reported.
   ``He is still considered a political figure of enormous national
and international prestige ... (but) he was not faultless ... and
made some mistakes,'' Lilov said.
   Also attending the ceremony were other senior Socialist Party
officials, including Premier Andrei Lukanov and former president
Petar Mladenov who resigned earlier this month.
   The urn with Dimitrov's ashes will be buried in a family grave
in a private ceremony for relatives later this week, a BTA official
said.
   A leading figure in the international Communist movement,
Dimitrov was acquitted in a trial in late 1933 in which he was
charged with complicity in the fire that destroyed the German
Reichstag (Parliament) building.
   Historians say that the arson was a Nazi provocation.
   In 1946, Dimitrov became leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party
and also headed the government until his death in 1949.
   During his leadership, the non-Communist opposition parties were
either disbanded or merged in a Communist-dominated mass
organization.
   The disinterment of Dimitrov marks another step away from four
decades of orthodox Communist rule since the ouster of Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov in November.
   Despite longtime official veneration, Dimitrov has become
increasingly unpopular, particularly in Sofia, where the
non-Communist opposition Union of Democratic Forces emerged as the
winner in last month's multiparty elections. The Socialists won a
majority in the Parliament due to a strong showing in the
countryside and provincial cities.
   A commission appointed by Sofia's municipal council will propose
possible new uses for the former mausoleum, a massive stone
building constructed in one week after Dimitrov's death.
   In the past, the mausoleum was a major attraction in Sofia, much
like Lenin's tomb in Moscow.
   The mausoleum was guarded around the clock by two soldiers in
traditional Balkan-style dress uniform, equipped with
bayonet-topped rifles.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: confirmation process.</HEAD>

   Q: Conservatives recently have expressed some disappointment
with your _ what they call the flip-flop on ``no new tax'' pledge,
your position on China, Lithuania, and the like. And Governor
Sununu is recognized as the champion of the conservatives in the
White House. Is his connection _ is the Judge's connection to
Governor Sununu, is this meant as an appeasement to the
conservative right? Do you think it will appease them?
   Bush: Sununu's got problems with his own credentials. I mean,
he's not going to help on that. And that's not what this is all
about. This matter, as I've indicated, was _ there was almost a
certain recusal on the part of Governor Sununu on this. Clearly, he
knows Judge Souter. He has great respect for Judge Souter. But this
process, as I'm sure Boyden Gray and Dick Thornburgh will tell you,
came up through a system. Excellence came to the top. And, so,
there is no politics of this nature in this kind of a _ this kind
of an appointment. If I was looking to shore up one factor or
another, there'd be plenty of more visible ways to do it. Here, we
are talking about excellence, judicial excellence, and the highest
degree of qualification, based on excellence, to be on the Court.
   Q: Mr. President, earlier today, Marlin Fitzwater said that
whomever you chose as your candidate, your nominee, would reflect
your general philosophy of government. Is it still your philosophy
that Roe vs. Wade, the abortion law, should be overturned?
   Bush: Look, you all can keep trying all day long to get me to
comment on abortion in relation to this nomination. And please keep
_ stop trying because I'm not going to respond in that vein. It
would be unfair to Judge Souter. It would be untrue because I
haven't looked at the nomination in that manner. And so, I simply
cannot _ and you get another question though, instead.
   Q: Well, my other question would simply be, just not respond in
the connection with Judge Souter. How about just your own personal
philosophy?
   Bush: I haven't changed my views, if that helps any.
   Q: Mr. President, I'm still not totally certain by why you feel
it was inappropriate to ask the Judge's views on the issues _
   Bush: Because that's _ I understand that's the customary way of
doing it, and that more important are the broad concepts of
excellence. Is the man qualified? Does he share a broad view that
what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the Constitution and
not legislate. And so that's all I need. And when you see the
background of this man, I'm confident the Senate will share my
views. You're looking for fairness. You're looking for equity.
   I wrote down a bunch of words to help me make the determination,
and I wish I had them because they're all along that _ those lines.
Experience. And I did say that I'd like somebody that will
interpret the Constitution, not legislate.
   Q: But can you even be sure of that, sir? Does that mean that
you've at least studied some of his rulings?
   Bush: There has been a great deal of work done in the Justice
Department at several levels, in our General Counsel's shop, on all
that kind of thing. But again, it would be inappropriate to go into
those cases that he may have ruled on when he was on the state
court or on the federal bench, and I would simply leave that to the
Senate. But, yes, there has been a thorough study of Judge Souter's
tremendously impressive record.
   Q: Mr. President, given the reality of getting a person
confirmed to the Supreme Court these days, are you braced for a big
battle?
   Bush: Well, I don't _ I'm not going into this nomination, or
thrusting Judge Souter into the nomination, expecting a highly
contentious battle. The man was confirmed by the Senate,
unanimously, and _ after testimony. So, I'm not suggesting there's
going to have to be or should be. I remember calmer days when there
weren't. So I would not anticipate a contentious battle. I would
anticipate thorough questioning. I would anticipate each Senator,
having enough information to make up his or her mind, based on the
record or responses to questions. But, no, I'm not _ we're not
bracing for some horrendous fight with the United States Senate,
and given his record, I would expect that the chances of that are
minimal.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Welcomes Cameroon Prisoner Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Monday welcomed an
announcement by Cameroon President Paul Biya that all political
prisoners in his central African country would be released soon.
   But the human rights group noted Cameroon continues to imprison
people for their political beliefs.
   No exact date was announced for the release.
   In a statement, Amnesty noted Biya's government frequently holds
people in administrative detention without charge or trial, tries
them unfairly before military tribunals or keeps them in jail after
they have been acquitted or completed their prison terms.
   Abdoulaye Mazou, for example, was convicted in 1984 to a
five-year term for his involvement in an unsuccessful coup attempt,
the London-based group said.
   The former lawyer and magistrate was considered a prisoner of
conscience when he was held in administrative detention for a year
after he had completed his sentence. Even after his release in
April, Mazou has been confined to his home, Amnesty said.
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning group noted many of the more than
100 political prisoners held since 1984 in connection with the
attempted coup remain in detention despite the president's promise
in April that they would be released.
   Among those held are former transport company official Paul
Daissala Dakole and Habouba Mousse, an airline employee.
   Former President Ahmadou Ahidjo turned over power to Biya in
1982 after 22 years in power. Though the transfer came about
peacefully, the two men later had a falling-out.
   On April 6, 1984, a faction of the elite Republican Guard loyal
to Ahidjo tried to topple Biya. Fighting raged around Yaounde for
two days before the rebels were suppressed by loyal troops.
   Official estimates say 70 died, but observers said as many as
1,000 were killed. At least 46 of the arrested plotters were later
executed.
   Ahidjo, who was in retirement in France, was tried in absentia
and condemned to death. Biya later lifted the sentence.
   Amnesty noted that despite Biya's statements on the release of
political prisoners two men recently were jailed after trying to
set up a political party in the one-party state.
   Former bar association president Yondo Mandengue Black and
Anicet Ekane, a company director, were sentenced to 3- and 4-year
prison terms in April by a special military court, the rights group
said.
   The two were imprisoned for attending meetings to discuss
multiparty democracy and setting up a new political party.
   Amnesty on Monday called for the release of the men they said
were prisoners of conscience.
   Two others, Nicole Ngakou and her brother, George Yopa, were
acquitted on charges of distributing subversive material in 1987
but continue to be held in administrative detention without charge
or trial.
   The Amnesty statement also cited the case of Djeukam Tchameni
Dominique, who was sentenced by a military court earlier this year
to three years in prison for bringing into the country an
audiocassette containing criticism of the government.
   Amnesty said it welcomed Biya's statement that he was ready to
allow the group to visit Cameroon and meet with government
officials.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Monday he'll join an effort to kill the B-2 bomber,
dealing a serious blow to President Bush's effort to build the
stealth aircraft.
   ``If the threats we face internationally were greater and the
deficits we face at home were smaller, we might continue to hedge
on the B-2. But they aren't and we can't,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
told reporters prior to his planned speech on the House floor
announcing his decision.
   Aspin's announcement comes on the eve of his committee's
crafting later this week of a $283 billion defense bill for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and is certain to give impetus to
House efforts to cancel the B-2 program.
   Legislation sponsored by three members of the Armed Services
panel _ Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Rowland, R-Conn., and
John Kasich, R-Ohio, _ would terminate the program at the 15 planes
in development.
   Proponents said they have the 218 votes necessary in the House
to kill the B-2, and Dellums predicted that with Aspin's support
the campaign to terminate the program will prevail in the Senate as
well.
   ``The more American people see and learn about this weapon
system the less support there is,'' Dellums said at a news
conference. ``So I'm going to stick my neck out and say this is the
year that we stop the B-2 bomber.''
   Kasich heralded victory in the House but declined to forecast
success when lawmakers craft a final defense bill.
   ``This seals the fate for the B-2, certainly for the House,''
said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., who has lobbied against the bomber
program, in which the government has invested more than $26
billion, and has kept a tally on the number of opponents.
   In his speech, a copy of which was made available to reporters,
Aspin vowed to work with the B-2 opponents and congratulated them
``on their impending success.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Aspin's
announcement ``will be a very influential statement and it will
have a major impact in Congress with respect to the B-2.''
   The Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, told
reporters at the Pentagon that Aspin's ``voice carries some extra
weight, and we'd hoped that we wouldn't have to fight that extra
weight.''
   Dugan vowed that the service would step up its lobbying in the
House for the bat-winged aircraft and said that killing the program
would ``send a message to friend and foe alike that the United
States has lost its stomach'' for defense.
   ``It is, in my view, criminal to shut it off at this point,''
Dugan said.
   Although the House may kill the program, support for the bomber
in the Senate remains with the Armed Services' powerful chairman,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., backing the aircraft.
   But even Nunn, who reiterated his support for the bomber, said
the B-2 faces problems in Congress and Aspin's decision makes the
fight to preserve the aircraft an ``uphill battle.''
   ``I do not believe that the B-2 program can be preserved unless
the president, the secretary of defense, the Joints Chiefs of Staff
and our arms control negotiators all argue forcefully for the
program,'' Nunn said in a statement.
   ``Without this support, the Senate Armed Services Committee
position is unlikely to prevail.''
   In approving its $289 billion defense bill, the Senate Armed
Services Committee agreed to Bush's request for two planes in
fiscal 1991. The full Senate is expected to consider the
legislation later this month.
   A proponent of the B-2, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said a final
decision on the bomber probably won't be made until the House and
Senate meet later this year to iron out the differences in their
two bills.
   But Skelton, whose district includes Whiteman Air Force Base
where a B-2 unit will be based, urged that in the meantime, the
Bush administration argue a better case for the bomber.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed by the lack of support by the
administration,'' said Skelton, who contended that former President
Reagan would have members of Congress to the White House to lobby
for the bomber.
   ``I understand they will be inviting people down to the White
House soon,'' he said. ``It may be a day late and a dollar short.''
   Aspin, who last year opposed a bill to kill the B-2, said he
based his latest decision on the cost of the bomber, its
capabilities and its mission. In the final analysis, Aspin said he
found no ``unique and compelling mission for the B-2.''
   ``It has not been demonstrated that we must build the B-2 now,''
he said. ``If we press ahead, we will spend additional tens of
billions of dollars before we know if the B-2 will work, and before
we know if it is really necessary. And that's assuming that there
would be room in the budget in the first place, which will be
extremely hard to find.''
   In his $307 billion military budget for fiscal 1991, Bush
proposed spending $5.5 billion for five of the radar-evading
aircraft and related items.
   But in April, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cited the lessening
Soviet threat and fiscal constraints as he presented his revised
plan for the program _ two bombers in fiscal 1991 at a cost of $4.6
billion and 75 planes total with a price tag of $63 billion.
   The Pentagon originally envisioned building 132 planes.
   Despite Cheney's revision, support for the bomber continued to
erode in Congress, where lawmakers expressed dismay over the cost
of a single plane, which under the scaled back plan rose to $815
million.
   Since Cheney's announcement, the Congressional Budget Office has
estimated that the bomber, which is manufactured by Northrop Corp.,
will likely cost $865 million apiece and the total program might
rise to $65 billion.

   A sailor accused of raping an enlisted
woman aboard the submarine tender USS Holland remained jailed
Monday pending a Navy investigation, an official said.
   The assault allegedly occurred July 14 while the ship was docked
here, its home port, said Lt. Cmdr. Drew Malcolm, spokesman at the
Charleston Navy Base.
   The suspect, a petty officer third class, could remain in a Navy
jail for up to 90 days before charges are filed, Malcolm said.
   A magistrate's hearing Friday determined there was enough
evidence to keep him jailed, Malcolm said.
   The victim, a junior enlisted woman, is on temporary leave,
Malcolm said.
   The allegations came one day before the court-martial in another
case involving the alleged rape three months ago of a female
officer, allegedly by another officer, aboard an ammunition supply
ship in the Mediterranean.
   The USS Holland spends most of its time in port here. The ship
has a total crew of 1,293, including 338 women, four of whom are
officers.

   Q: Do you think a President these days has to do more of a
selling job than in the past?
   Bush: I don't know, Maureen. I don't think so, if the record
speaks for itself. If I'd have selected somebody out of the
political arena that had never been on the bench and never had any
experience but was in my view well qualified, there might well have
been more intervention on my part. I'm prepared to do whatever is
appropriate in not only defending but advocating this confirmation,
but I don't believe there's going to be a lot of personal
involvement necessary because I think his record and his standing
will speak for itself.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, I've got to make one more try. You say it's
inappropriate to ask, but you also admit there is a lot of
background paperwork on someone. Judge Souter was appointed to the
New Hampshire court by Governor Sununu, whose feelings on abortion
are well known. Your feelings on abortion are well known. Why
should we not believe that that is a factor in your selection?
   Bush: Because I've told you it's not, and because you ought to
listen to the testimony in the Hill, and then you can make up your
mind better when you've seen the evidence. And that _ I expect
people will be raising this question. I've seen a lot of
speculation on it over the last 48 hours or whatever it was since
Justice Brennan retired. But I'm telling you _ you asked me what my
view was _ and I've told you how I approach this matter, and that's
all I can do.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you said a moment ago that there are Senate
precedents on how questioning happens in the Judiciary Committee.
In fact, there are two very contrasting precedents. There was the
Bork precedent, where the nominee answered all sorts of questions,
and there was the Justice O'Connor-Justice Kennedy precedent, in
which the nominee declined to answer a lot of specific questions
about how the nominee felt. Do you have any preference about how
your nominee handles these questions?
   Bush: No, but I have confidence my nominee will handle it
properly, and he's _ look, the man is a judge on an appeals court.
He knows how to treat with this, and the Senate is a free Senate,
and they know how to treat with it. So that _ I'm not going to get
into that. I think it's inappropriate for a President to do that
kind of thing.
   Q: Do you think it's appropriate for a nominee to answer
specific questions about how he might rule on _
   Bush: I would leave that to the nominee, and let the Senate make
the final determination.
   Yes?
   Q: Were there one or two aspects of the judge's background that
_ qualifications that particularly brought him to the top of the
list?
   Bush: Being bright, extraordinarily bright and then a record for
fairness, extraordinarily fair. Well, I've made my judgment based _
you've asked me what I decided it on, and these are some of the
qualifications that I think are essential. Plus I gave you the
underpinning, which I want somebody that is not going to be a
legislator sitting on the Supreme Court.
   Yeah? And then Ann.
   Q: Did you meet Judge Souter before you made this decision other
than the last couple of days?
   Bush: Yes, just within the last couple of days.
   Q: _ the first time you've ever seen him?
   Bush: First time I'd met him. And who knows, the amount of time
I spent in New Hampshire I might well have seen him. But I _
(laughter) we've been, as I have indicated, been talking to our
attorney general and Boyden Gray on resumes, or on records for a
long, long time. And the man is very highly regarded, so _ but I _
no, I just had a short visit with Judge Souter today and,
obviously, was quite impressed.
   Yes, Ann?
   Q: You had already decided at that point, sir?
   Bush: No, I had not decided, and that's the truth _ as is
everything else I said here. (Laughter.) Yeah, go ahead.
   Q: In _ in speaking to your advisors about resumes and records,
as you say, did you ask your advisors to produce only nominees who
had no extensive written record on the abortion issue _
   Bush: No.
   Q: _ that _ (inaudible) _ more candidates who would not provoke
a large debate over _
   Bush: No.
   Yeah, Owen?
   Q: I wonder if you can you tell me, how is it possible to make
the selection without reviewing the judge's record or a summary of
his record that dealt with specific cases, if not abortion,
affirmative action, civil rights issues, free speech _ a lot of the
emotional issues that the country is very concerned about?
   Bush: Most of his writings have been at the state level and the
_ the _ I made the decision based on the criteria that I gave you.
   Q: So you're telling us that you have no idea what his judicial
opinions are on abortion, affirmative action and civil rights, flag
burning?
   Bush: I'm telling you that you should stay tuned and let the
testimony before the United States Senate determine whether he's
confirmed or not, and that that will bring out all the questions
that you're asking here. And the answers, that's up to the judge to
see how he should handle that as one who is going to have to deal
with a lot of issues in the future.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, has Governor Sununu, who is well acquainted
with the nominee, given you his reading on the Judge's views on
controversial issues?
   Bush: No, there's _ no. No.
   Way in the back.
   Q: (Inaudible).
   Q: Am I back far enough?

<TEXT>
   The juggernaut of German unity suddenly has
been stopped by what would appear to be a petty political clash,
but which in fact could determine who runs the unified nation.
   Politicians in both Germanys were pointing fingers Monday while
many Germans were shaking their heads over the seemingly trivial
issue of whether unification should take place Dec. 1 or Dec. 2.
   German newspapers have derided the partisan slugfest as
``sleazy'' and ``pointless,'' especially because East Germans are
struggling with mounting joblessness and soaring prices.
   In the past week, the issue has threatened to collapse the
fragile coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
and laid bare intense, behind-the-scenes political maneuvering.
   On Monday night, the infighting intensified, when East Germany's
Social Democrats and the centrist Liberals refused to take part in
a meeting of coalition leaders.
   The two parties cited as their reason for not attending the
meeting de Maiziere's insistence that unification cannot come
before elections in both Germanys.
   Leaders of the two parties called separate meetings for Tuesday
morning, saying they would recommend to their membership pulling
out of de Maiziere's coalition government unless he compromises on
the issue.
   The date of unification is considered important because it could
help determine who will control the new German government, and
which parties will not even have a voice.
   ``It would be decisive for the composition of the Parliament and
the government,'' said Klaus Becher, a political analyst for the
German Society for Foreign Politics in Bonn, West Germany.
   East Germany's left-leaning Social Democrats, the nation's
second-largest party, and a Liberal alliance have demanded that
unity occur a day before German elections, tentatively set for Dec.
2.
   They are demanding all of Germany act as a single electorate
that chooses a united Parliament.
   De Maiziere and several smaller parties _ ranging from the
former Communists to the activists who overthrew them _ want the
two nations to formally unify immediately after elections are held.
   Under this proposal, simultaneous elections would be held in
each nation. The votes would be counted separately and political
representation would be based on how each party did in its own
country.
   East Germany's Parliament already has passed a law requiring
that a party receive 5 percent of the vote in order to be
represented in Parliament, the same rule as in West Germany.
   Under de Maiziere's proposal, smaller parties in East Germany _
including the Communists _ would stand a better chance of winding
up in the united Parliament.
   That would help the Christian Democratic parties of de Maiziere
and especially his mentor, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who
wants to lead a united Germany.
   The conservative Christian Democrats rely more on coalitions
with conservative and centrist parties for parliamentary majorities.
   The Social Democrats, meanwhile, would be hurt by separate
elections because a proliferation of small leftist parties could
split the left-leaning representation in Parliament.
   The Social Democrats in West Germany are the main opposition
party, but in East Germany they are a member of de Maiziere's
broad, seven-party coalition government.
   The East German Social Democrats and the Liberal alliance have
threatened to bolt the coalition _ and perhaps collapse the
government _ unless single elections are held.
   East Germany's Parliament met until midnight Sunday trying to
break the impasse, then finally agreed to throw the issue to
committees of both German parliaments.
   On Monday, all the parties traded more charges. De Maiziere's
chief spokesman, Matthias Gehler, said the prime minister planned
to meet with Kohl this week in Austria, where Kohl is vacationing,
to discuss the crisis.
   But time is a factor. Both Parliaments have left for their
summer breaks and are not to return until the end of August. They
must enact election laws by Sept. 3.
   ``It has become increasingly unlikely there will be all-German
elections on the 2nd of December,'' Becher said.
   Virtually everyone involved in the debate has taken a drubbing
in the press.
   ``This questionable, sleazy debate over trivialities throws a
stumbling block in the path toward German unification,'' the
Cologne Rundschau of Cologne, West Germany, said Monday.
   The Hagen, West Germany, newspaper Westfalenpost said: ``The
wrangling over the coalition in East Berlin represents politics at
its worst.''
   The issue threatens not only the East German governing
coalition, but Kohl's governing partnership, which is becoming
increasingly divided on the matter.

<HEAD>Residents Support Millionaire Who Spray Paints Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A millionaire facing criminal charges
after he went around town defacing ``For Sale'' signs he said
marred the landscape in tony Greenwich has become a folk hero among
some residents, officials said.
   Town Planner Jim Sandy said he's received at least 35 letters
supporting Rene Anselmo, 64, who was arrested July 3 for
spray-painting a real estate sign Anselmo said was offensive and
illegal. Anselmo pleaded innocent to a charge of third-degree
criminal mischief.
   ``I'm getting letter after letter saying he should be knighted
instead of cited,'' Sandy said last week. ``They love him.''
   After his arrest, the 64-year-old president of Pan American
Satellite Corp. said that real estate signs were ``turning all
these streets into a used car lot.''
   He said he spray-painted the sign because it had been illegally
placed on town property and admitted he had painted others.
   ``The town should recognize your efforts to beautify and improve
the quality of life, instead of charging you, of all people, with
mischief,'' said one resident who wrote to Sandy.
   Said another: ``Bully for you! I have wanted to do that for
years.''
   Real estate agents, who are trying to sell houses in a slow
market, are unhappy.
   Stanley Klein, president of Empire Realty Corp., called
Anselmo's actions ``mindless vandalism.''
   ``I was almost tempted to spray-paint Mr. Anselmo's gate,''
Klein said.
   Anselmo, a resident for 23 years, donated $40,000 to the town
last year to plant trees and pays annually for the planting of
flowers on town property.
   He faces a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and six months in
prison if convicted. He is due back in Superior Court in Stamford
Aug. 24.

   Bush: One, two, three, and then I'm leaving.
   Q: I wonder if you could tell me, sir, you extolled the Judge's
virtues and pointed out more than once that he was unanimously
confirmed by the Senate for his present position, can you think of
any reason, any possibility, the Senate would not confirm the Judge
for this post _
   Bush: No.
   Q: _ other than ideological grounds?
   Bush: I can think of none why they would not confirm him. None!
Period.
   Q: And would you object strenuously to a confirmation battle
over ideological grounds?
   Bush: Look, I've nothing to say about that. This is a separate
body. I don't control the Senate. I would hope they would accept
the _ when they've had a chance to ask questions and they've had a
chance to review his record, would conclude, as I have, that he is
outstandingly well-qualified for the federal bench, a judgment that
was given to him not too long ago by the ABA itself.
Well-qualified, which I gather is the highest rating a judge can
have.
   Q: You had said you're not interested in making a Bush imprint
on the Court. You may also be _
   Bush: I have to, I guess, but I'm not interested in having this
known as a Bush Court or something of that nature.
   Q: Well, you may be called upon throughout your term to actually
name one or two others. Do you have those in mind? And also, if _
   Bush: Yes.
   Q: By having those names in mind of who you would appoint, are
you doing the same thing like in foreign policy, saying that you
want to choose a prudent man or that the imprint would be something
peculiar to you, in other words a _
   Bush: Look, I'll tell you how I look at this, not in terms of
some specific imprint, but I want it said when I'm about _ let's
see, 66 _ about 90, 24 years from now, that I made a superb choice,
and I think it will be so writ.
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the phrase you're
using on you're opposed to somebody who would legislate from the
bench. You're on record as wanting Roe vs. Wade overturned. You're
on record as favoring a flag-burning amendment to the Constitution.
Aren't those sorts of issues tantamount to legislating from the
bench as well?
   Bush: Well, what _ you'd have to tell me the case and advise me
as to how _ I don't think so. I don't think, when called upon to
answer a constitutional question, that that has to be legislating
from the bench.
   Q: But you would not be upset if the Court overturned Roe vs.
Wade?
   Bush: No.
   Q: Or if the Court upheld the flag-burning amendment?
   Bush: No, and a lot of other things, too. I believe in the
separation of powers. I happen to think that there's been a _ many,
many things have troubled me, encroachment of micro-management by
the United States Congress on the presidency. But I haven't asked
this able judge about those things. But I could cite _ you cite
two. You cite one that's been on everybody's lips ever since I _
since Justice Brennan retired. Listen, I never heard such coverage
on the television. You might just think the whole nomination had
something to do with abortion. And it's far broader than that. I
have too much respect for the Supreme Court than to look at one
specific issue and one alone. I've got time for one _ yeah, Kathy?
   Q: Mr. President, there's been some speculation you might name
an Hispanic this time and make history in doing so. You went a
different route. What do you say to those who might be disappointed
that didn't happen, and what is the likelihood you might name an
Hispanic should another vacancy develop?
   Bush: First, I say to whoever it is that inquires, I've made the
best choice I possibly could make in terms of qualifications,
ability, background, and temperament to serve on this court. And
then I say: Look, the great thing about this country is you can
achieve anything. And there's a lot of time down the road in which
I'm sure you'll see a different makeup on the Court. But I don't _
I'm not going to deal in any one specific group, vis-a-vis another
one. And that's what I would say. But I just would ask the American
people to understand I looked at a wide array of names prior to my
getting into it in as much depth as I have very recently. The
Attorney General, his staff, Boyden Gray and his staff, went
through this process. It's a continuance _ it's a process that's
been going on for some time. And this _ the excellence was just
there at the top. And so, I would not cite this as something
discouraging for anybody that aspires to the Supreme Court or any
group that would aspire to have representation on the Supreme
Court. Listen, I really do have to go _
   Q: What did you ask him when you interviewed him?
   Q: Did you interview the other finalists, Mr. President? Did he
win in the interview?
   Bush: He did very, very well.
   Q: Two or three _
   Bush: Yeah, let me get one _ I've been _ I failed to _
   Q: Two or three of the candidates that were mentioned were from
your home state and there was talk that you perhaps would choose
somebody from the South because you felt the South was in
under-representation since Justice Powell resigned. Wasn't anybody
qualified in the South or why did you _
   Bush: No, there's plenty of people qualified and you raise a
good point because there aren't _ there is nobody from the _ what I
would call the Southeast conference South, but the South, excluding
Texas, that _ that is on the bench now. And there's about a quarter
of the people from there. So, this is a consideration and was a
consideration; it was forcefully brought home to me by key members
of Congress. And yet I determined that Judge Souter, given the
qualifications I've tried to extoll here, the virtues, is the
choice for the federal _ for the Supreme Court at this time.
   But no, these calls are not easy. And Kathy asked about
different ethnic groups. You asked about regional distribution. And
I think one considers all these _ all these criteria. I think it's
fair to say that New England, which is not represented on the bench
now that Justice Brennan is retired, might look at it, if I had
gone with another nominee, as why were they excluded? So, I can
understand regionalism. But, please believe me, as a proud Texan, I
tried to look at it on a _ in a national sense. And I think I've
come up with the best nominee. Jesse, I'm sorry to disappoint you _
   Q: A very quick follow-up, if I could. Senator Simpson suggested
that you follow the counsel of Mrs. Bush. Did you in any way on
this particular issue?
   Bush: How did he know? He doesn't even know who I nominated. How
could he have said that?
   Q: He said that he hoped that that would be what you would do.
   Bush: Oh, I see. Wonderful fellow, Al.

<HEAD>Engineer Says Test Shows Florida Chair is in Working Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A makeshift inmate _ made up of a metal
colander to represent a human head, a vat of saline solution for
the body and a piece of pipe as a leg _ was jolted with current in
Florida's electric chair Monday.
   The experiment was a state-ordered test to show the chair works
correctly and the botched execution of Jesse Tafero was probably
caused by a synthetic sponge.
   ``The electric chair works as it is supposed to,'' said Mike
Morse, an associate professor of electrical engineering at Auburn
University and the electrical engineer who conducted the test.
   The test was carried out in the death chamber at Florida State
Prison in front of journalists, state officials, representatives of
the General Electric Co. and officials with corrections departments
from Virginia and South Carolina.
   But lawyers who represent death-row inmates in Florida said they
were unimpressed and would continue appeals based on arguments that
the chair will torture the next inmate strapped into it.
   With the contraption sitting in the wooden electric chair, Morse
conducted the 15-minute demonstration, which caused a noisy
buzzing, to check whether the chair was functioning properly.
   The test was ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez after the botched May
4 electrocution of Tafero, who died amid smoke and flames.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has blocked several
recent executions because of questions raised by defense attorneys
about the chair's effectiveness.
   The governor said he is ``satisfied that this objective test by
independent experts conclusively shows what we have been saying all
along _ that Florida's electric chair is in working order. ...''
   ``It is my sincere hope that defense attorneys will cease using
this false argument as a basis for unsubstantiated appeals,'' he
said.
   During Monday's test, the current was turned on and meters
attached to the device showed that the chair was putting out 2,000
volts and 10 to 11 amps.
   ``It was a picture-perfect demonstration,'' Morse said.
   Defense attorneys contend the amount of electricty reaching
Tafero wasn't enough to kill him instantly.
   The engineer said he had conducted similar tests over the
weekend using the same kind of synthetic sponge used for the first
time in the Tafero execution and had seen results similar to that
controversial death.
   He said the sponge caused ``electrical arcing, flames and
sparks.''
   But Morse believes the jolt received by Tafero was still lethal.
   ``It is very unlikely after the initial shock that he felt any
pain,'' Morse said. ``It would be highly unlikely that the brain
would be functioning.''
   State Rep. Ron Silver, a North Miami Democrat who is chairman of
the House Committee on Criminal Justice, attended the test and said
he hoped it would satisfy the circuit court.
   Martinez, who had earlier blamed the fire on the
never-before-used synthetic sponge that won't be used again, said
he ordered the tests to show the appeals judges that the chair is
functioning.
   Defense attorneys for other death row inmates have successfully
delayed several recent scheduled executions by arguing that Tafero
was burned alive by low voltage and that present clients might
suffer the same fate, a violation of the U.S. Constitution's
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``I hope this demonstration and test will be satisfactory, and
if it is not, we need to proceed from there to do what is necessary
to carry out the laws of the state,'' Silver said.

   Senators who will decide whether to confirm
Judge David Souter's for the Supreme Court said Monday they want to
learn more about his little-known track record before deciding
whether to support him.
   The chief question, from many Democratic lawmakers and
particularly interest groups in the debate over abortion, was
Souter's views on abortion in general and on the landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion in particular.
   Pro-choice groups, concerned the sudden Supreme Court vacancy
could lead to the reversal of Roe vs. Wade, demanded that the
Senate Judiciary Committee question Souter extensively about his
views on the issue.
   A leading anti-abortion group, meanwhile, said it did not
believe Souter had ever expressed an opinion on abortion. But the
group, the National Right to Life Committee, said it was pleased
that President Bush said he chose Souter because of his philosophy
of not trying to legislate from the bench.
   ``Since Roe vs. Wade has no basis in the Constitution, the
appointment of such justices should continue the erosion of the
tragic error of Roe vs. Wde,'' the Right to Life Committee said in
a statement.
   The reaction from key senators was far more restrained, for the
most part because Souter, on the federal bench for less than a
year, is little known.
   ``There will be a lot more known about him, I guarantee you
that,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a Judiciary Committee
member.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a leading Judiciary Committee
member and early opponent of President Reagan's failed nomination
of Robert Bork to the court, said he would await hearing from
Souter before making up his mind.
   Without mentioning the word abortion, Kennedy made it clear he
viewed the issue as central to the Judiciary Committee's
deliberations.
   ``The Judiciary Committee and the full Senate have a
responsibility to determine whether he possesses a strong
commitment to the fundamental values of the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights that are obviously at stake in this important
nomination and that will profoundly affect the lives and rights of
all Americans,'' Kennedy said.
   More praise came from Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a former
attorney general of his stater who served as president of the
National Association of Attorneys General while Souter was attorney
general for New Hampshire.
   ``He was an outstanding attorney general so my initial reaction
is positive,'' said Gorton, who is not a Judiciary Committee member.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, praised
Souter's experience as a judge and as New Hampshire state attorney
general but did not express an opinion on the nomination. Mitchell
promised Democrats would conduct prompt and fair hearings.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking Republican on the
Judiciary Committee, said he expected few if any fireworks over
Souter's record ``because he just went on the court in April and I
don't think he's had a controversial matter since then.''
   But another Democratic panel member, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio, said the swift approval of Souter to the 1st Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston should not be considered a bellweather.
   ``There is a difference between being confirmed for the appeals
court and for the Supreme Court,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the panel's No. 2 Republican, said he
wanted to ``get to know him, get to know his record, so I'll make a
considered decision, and I'm sure he'll be fine.''
   Some committee members said they would hold to the tradition of
refraining from questions on how nominees would decide specific
issues before the court.
   Still, Leahy said questions likely would be phrased to include
abortion rights as a topic.
   ``I think it would be naive to think that Roe vs. Wade in one
form or another is not going to be part of a lot of questions,
interestingly enough, with the desire to know about that coming
from both sides of the issue.''
   Thurmond said he would have preferred a candidate from the
South, but added: ``I'm going to support this nomination.''
   New Hampshire GOP Sen. Warren Rudman, a Souter friend for years,
said senators will find the 50-year-old nominee to be ``a classic
conservative intellectual. ... He cannot be characterized as an
ideologue in any way, shape or form.''
   The pro-choice groups promised to be heard and called for
detailed questioning on Roe vs. Wade.
   ``The American people need to know where Judge Souter stands on
the issues of individual and human rights,'' said Judith Lichtman,
president of the National Women's Legal Defense Fund.
   ``It would be a terrible injustice to confirm a nominee without
knowing that he is commited to protecting Americans' fundamental
constitutional rights, including privacy and the right to choose,''
said Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   Outside of Washington, Alan Dershowitz, a liberal attorney and
professor at Harvard Law School, from which Souter graduated,
called the nomination ``a Sununu special.''
   John Sununu, Bush's White House chief of staff, was the
Republican New Hampshire governor who elevated Souter to the state
Supreme Court.

   As a student at Harvard Law School 25 years
ago, David H. Souter was a resident adviser in a freshman dorm at
Harvard College, where his charges included one Charles G.
Untermeyer.
   Untermeyer is now the White House personnel director. Souter on
Monday became President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court.
   Untermeyer was not involved directly in the selection process.
That fell to White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray, Atorney General
Dick Thornburgh and others.
   But Untermeyer said Monday he remembers Souter's scholarly mien
as a freshman dorm chief. Souter had returned to Harvard for law
school after two years at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.
   ``He strikes me as sort of the pluperfect scholar,'' said
Untermeyer.
   Souter could ``give the impression with the movement of an eye
and the slightest inclination of his head that he was catching
everything that goes on _ which is exactly the type of person you
want watching over a freshman dorm,'' said Untermeyer.

<TEXT>
   Quebec offered Monday to resume talks with
Oka Mohawks regarding a violent dispute over a golf course addition
planned on land claimed as ancestral territory. The provincial
government also agreed that observers from human rights
organizations could attend.
   John Ciaccia, Quebec's native affairs minister, said the
province wants the talks held away from the barricades, where
Indians and police have faced each other for nearly two weeks. A
shootout July 11 resulted in the death of a Quebec police officer.
   The Red Cross, one of the few groups allowed beyond the
barricades by police, would be permitted to continue providing food
and supplies, according to a Quebec statement. That meets another
Mohawk demand for free movement of food and medicine.
   Ciaccia's proposals were seen by some Mohawks as a ``step in the
right direction,'' said Peter Diome, spokesman for the Mohawk
Nation office in Kahnawake. ``At least they are now making an
effort to reopen the lines of communication that they previously
closed.''
   But Diome said progress will be limited until the federal
government gets involved.
   ``We're still talking about nation-to-nation and where is the
federal government?'' he asked.
   Ciaccia said in an interview he wants talks held outside the
barricades ``not for security reasons but to create an atmosphere
of calm. ... We must accept that the only way to resolve this is
through peaceful negotiations. There is no question of armed
violence.''
   In Ottawa, a senior Indian Affairs official told reporters
Monday a ``gang of criminals'' have taken over negotiations in Oka,
18 miles west of Montreal.
   The federal official, who spoke at an off-the-record briefing,
said a radical element in the Mohawk community ``has hijacked the
land claims negotiations and is holding the Mohawk community in a
state of armed insurrection.''
   He was talking about reports that the militant Warrior Society
is controlling events at Oka.
   Mohawks from nearby Kahnawake reserve have blockaded the Mercier
Bridge into Montreal in support of the Oka Mohawks. Some commuters
have to spend an extra two hours in travel daily, and an
anti-Indian backlash has developed.
   Ciaccia wants only Mohawk representatives from Kahnawake and
Kahnesetake involved in new negotiations. Kahnesatake is the Mohawk
settlement at Oka.
   This would exclude militant Warriors from the Akwesasne reserve
near Cornwall, Ontario, who moved into Oka to join the others.
   Indians in Canada's westernmost British Columbia province also
erected barricades in sympathy and to press their own claims.
   Quebec police tried to storm a barricade Mohawks erected in Oka
to stop the expansion of a local golf course onto what Mohawks say
is sacred land. Responsibility for the death of the policeman
killed in the resulting gunfire has not been fixed.
   Ciaccia and the Mohawks had been going into the woods behind
Mohawk barricades for talks until discussions broke down a week ago.
   One request by the Mohawks was that observers from the United
Nations or Amnesty International monitor the talks.
   Ciaccia suggested Monday that members of the Quebec Human Rights
Commission, or other Quebec or Canadian institutions agreeable to
both sides be allowed to observe the talks.

   Bush offered the praise in a brief letter acknowledging
Brennan's retirement.
   Here is the text:
   ``Dear Mr. Justice:
   ``It is with deep regret that I acknowledge your letter of
retirement.
   ``Your 33 years of service on our nation's highest court,
spanning eight presidents, have been marked with great distinction

<TEXT>
   The feds are seizing Jim Bakker's prison
wages to cover the fines he owes on a fraud conviction, but it'll
take a long time to collect: The former TV evangelist owes $501,025
and he makes 11 cents an hour.
   So far, the government has garnisheed a total of $25 from the
former PTL president, assistant U.S. Attorney Clifford Marshal said
Monday.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year fraud and conspiracy sentence at the
Federal Medical Center, a lockup in Rochester, Minn.
   Bakker cleans toilets, his attorney said earlier this year.
   The government is looking elsewhere for assets, including a
pension fund set up for Bakker, Marshall said.
   ``But it's not mature for disbursement yet,'' he added.
   PTL collapsed amid a sex and money scandal after it was revealed
Bakker had sex with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker and three other PTL employees were convicted in
connection with the ministry's defrauding followers who sent $158
million to the television ministry.
   Brothers James and David Taggart, convicted of tax evasion, owe
the government $535,174.64 each. Neither has made any payments
since being sentenced to 18 years in prison, said Marshall.
   Richard Dortch, Bakker's top lieutenant, has paid $25 of his
$200,000 fine. He was originally sentenced to eight years in
prison, but that was reduced to 2{ years affer he testified against
other defendants.

<HEAD>Workers Cited Safety Problems To Relatives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two of the 17 workers killed by an explosion
at a Texas chemical plant had told relatives they were worried
about the plant's safety, the family members told a House panel
Monday.
   The workers also had worries about training at Atlantic
Richfield Co.'s plant in Channelview, where vapors caught fire and
exploded near an electric compressor July 5.
   ``Safety has to come before profit,'' said Sandy Davis, widow of
Greg Davis, a contract electrician killed in the blast. Ms. Davis
wept while testifying that her husband told her several times he
was unsure of the skills of some of his fellow contractors.
   The chief of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
Gerald Scannell, said the agency has proposed new safety rules for
the chemical industry. But the rules aren't being put into place
fast enough, said two Houston congressmen, Democrat Mike Andrews
and Republican Jack Fields.
   ``Waiting on studies is not necessary,'' Andrews said.
   ``There's not a chance in hell I'd work for a chemical plant
unless I had a 1-year-old child and was out of work,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., referring to Davis, whose widow said he
took the Arco job in suburban Houston after being unemployed for
six months and becoming a new father.
   But Fields cautioned, ``It is doubtful that the government, or
any particular company, can ever completely guarantee that
something isn't going to go wrong.''
   The congressmen said they were frustrated that 40 workers had
been killed at chemical companies in the nine months since the
House employment and housing subcommittee examined the October
explosion that killed 23 at a Phillips plastics plant in Pasadena,
another Houston suburb.
   OSHA has since cited Phillips for 575 ``willful and serious''
violations and fined the company $5.7 million. Phillips has
appealed. The agency is still investigating the Channelview
incident, Scannell said.
   As in Pasadena, many of the victims at the Channelview plant
were contract laborers. OSHA began a study of the use of contract
laborers at chemical plants after the Phillips incident. The study,
being written at Lamar University's John Gray Institute, is
expected to be complete this fall.
   Eleven of the Channelview victims, including Davis, were
employees of Austin Industries.
   Arco uses such workers for ``ongoing capital programs'' at all
its plants, said Harold Sorgenti, president of Arco Chemical Co. He
estimated Arco saved $600,000 to $750,000 in salary and benefits
annually by using the contract laborers at Channelview.
   The contract workers were not covered by Arco's life or health
insurance. But the families of all 17 victims are receiving
$250,000 with no strings attached, Sorgenti said.
   Davis got less training, less pay and fewer benefits than Arco's
regular employees at Channelview, his widow said. He did not have
the right to turn down overtime work, Ms. Davis said.
   ``If they refused this overtime, they put a bad mark on your
record,'' said Bernard Blackstock, father of John Blackstock, an
Arco employee killed in the incident.
   John Blackstock contributed to an anonymous letter sent recently
to plant managers seeking changes in the operation, his father
said. The workers did not want to sign their names because they
were afraid they'd be fired, he said.

<TEXT>
   Teamster officials voted Monday to stop
deliveries to about 60 supermarkets being picketed by striking
employees.
   About 5,300 supermarket employees in five counties were off the
job Monday as a strike over medical benefits and wages moved into
its third day.
   The strike by Local 555 of the United Food and Commercial
Workers affects 116 supermarkets. Picket lines were set up at about
60 stores, and the Teamster Joint Council voted Monday afternoon to
suspend deliveries to those stores, said John Trout, the council's
president.
   If picket lines were formed at the other 56 stories, the
Teamsters would consider halting deliveries there, as well, he said.
   Virtually all the affected stores' goods are delivered by
Teamster drivers.
   The strike was started Saturday by 210 union members who work at
13 Kienow's stores.
   The other 5,180 union members joined the strike after union
clerks, meat cutters and bakery and delicatessen workers were
locked out of their jobs at Safeway, Fred Meyer, Albertson's, some
Thriftway stores and several independent supermarkets in the
Portland area.
   The union's three-year contract expired at midnight Saturday.
   Strikers picketed Monday at the Kienow's stores, at 35 Safeway
stores and at two Thriftway stores.
   Steve Erdmann, spokesman for Food Employers Inc., said the
stores were hiring replacements for the striking clerks.
   Consumers should expect longer lines at checkout counters and
some stores that usually were open around the clock would close
from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m., he said.
   Health care has been the major issue during contract talks, with
the union pressing for employers to continue to pay for benefits.
The employers want employees to assume part of the rising costs.
   The workers, who have not had a pay increase since 1986, also
seek wage increases greater than the 2{ percent yearly boost
management has offered as part of a proposed four-year agreement,
said Rick Sawyer, a spokesman for Local 555.
   Journeymen clerks earn $11.05 an hour.
   The union represents employees at stores in Multnomah,
Washington, Clackamas, Yamhill and Columbia counties.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Chief Says States Will be Allowed to Secede</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borisav Jovic, the Serb now leading
Yugoslavia's collective presidency, said on Monday that individual
states will be allowed to secede from the fragile Yugoslav
federation.
   The federation of six member states may itself be radically
reshaped.
   ``Four republics are in favor of federation, two are for a
confederation,'' Jovic said in a statement read to reporters after
his meeting with Slovenia's President Milan Kucan in Ljubljana, the
republic's capital.
   The local governments of Croatia and Slovenia insist that this
Balkan nation of 23 million residents should become a loose
association of near-independent states, which would remain united
only if joint interests warrant it.
   Communist-ruled Serbia, the largest republic, has held until now
that a confederate structure would be too unstable, and advocated
retaining the federal system installed in 1945. The three small
remaining states _ Bosnia and Hercegovin; Macedonia, and Montenegro
_ also prefer a federation.
   Jovic said that if states favoring a looser union could not
reach agreement with the rest of the country, they would be
permitted to enter into a confederation with the other republics
that would stay in the current federal structure.
   ``A sub-variant is that (regions that so desire) would also be
allowed to secede from Yugoslavia,'' Jovic said.
   He said he and Kucan ``had very detailed and very open talks on
the future of Yugoslavia (and) its future constitutional setup.''
   ``We agreed that everybody should refrain from making any
unilateral changes'' until a joint decision on the future of this
ethnically diverse nation is reached, Jovic said.
   Slovenia's newly elected government has served notice the
northern republic of 2 million people would declare itself
independent if the other states do not accept its demands to turn
Yugoslavia into a grouping of sovereign republics.
   Croatia's new center-right authorities, also support
transforming Yugoslavia into a confederation, but say they want to
discuss the nation's future makeup at a joint meeting of ``the
legitimate representatives of all states.''
   The Slovenian Parliament last week publicly refused to consider
a letter from the federal presidency because it was not written in
the local language.
   ``Slovenia will seek sovereignty, complete economic and cultural
sovereignty in a Yugoslav confederation,'' Kucan said in his
statement.
   Yugoslavia was formed as a joint kingdom of Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes after World War I. Occupied and dismembered by Nazi
Germany in 1941, it re-emerging as a Communist-style federation
under Josip Tito after World War II, with Macedonia, Montenegro and
Bosnia-Hercegovina added to the three prewar states.
   Serbia only now is taking a tentative step toward a multiparty
system.
   Slovenia and Croatia held free elections this year in which
center-right parties won the majority, marking the first free
balloting here in 50 years.

<NOTE>Eds: New material throughout; CORRECTS that Bush first met with
Souter on Monday</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday said he would
nominate David H. Souter, a little-known federal appeals court
judge, to the Supreme Court. Bush said he acted without questioning
Souter on abortion or other delicate judicial issues.
   If confirmed by a majority of the Senate, Souter, a 50-year-old
bachelor from New Hampshire, would succeed William J. Brennan, who
retired last Friday.
   Bush's quick decision took Washington by surprise and shifted
the nation's attention to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is
certain to examine Souter's record and explore his views on
abortion and other issues.
   With Souter standing at his side, Bush described Souter as ``a
remarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest ability.'' He
chose his nominee after meeting him for the first time earlier in
the day.
   The president said it would have been ``inappropriate'' to apply
an abortion ``litmus test'' on his nominee. He said the selection
was not geared to any single issue but to his ability to interpret
the law.
   Souter has been on the federal appeals court for such a short
period of time that he has not yet penned an opinion.
   Gordon Tiffany, like Souter a former New Hampshire attorney
general, said it is hard to classify Souter's judicial philosophy.
   ``Whether it's liberal or conservative, it's not the issue in
his mind. The issue in his mind is what was intended in the
Constitution,'' Tiffany said.
   Conservatives hoped Bush would give them a nominee who would
overthrow the 1973 Roe-vs.-Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The nomination appeared to underscore the influence exercised by
John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, who as governor of New
Hampshire had put Souter on that state's Supreme Court in 1983.
Like Bush, Sununu is an outspoken opponent of abortion.
   Andrew Card, Sununu's deputy, said Sununu did not suggest Souter
to Bush.
   At a news conference, a questioner noted that Bush and Sununu
both have widely known views against abortion and asked why people
shouldn't think that Souter's abortion view was known to Bush even
if Bush did not question him about it.
   ``I told you it's not,'' Bush said.
   The National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion
group, said it did not believe Souter had ever expressed an opinion
on abortion. But the committee said it was pleased that Bush said
he chose Souter because of his philosophy of not trying to
legislate from the bench.
   Bush noted that Souter had won unanimous Senate confirmation
when he was nominated in January for the appeals court, suggesting
his hope that the nomination might not trigger a political
free-for-all in the Senate.
   ``We're not bracing for some horrendous fight with the United
States Senate,'' Bush said.
   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., a liberal member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said it would be ``naive'' to think that
Souter would not be quizzed about abortion.
   ``There will be a lot more known about him, I guarantee you
that,'' said Leahy.
   In fact, pro-choice groups demanded that committee sound Souter
out on his abortion views.
   ``The American people need to know where Judge Souter stands on
the issues of individual and human rights,'' said Judith Lichtman,
president of the National Women's Legal Defense Fund.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell praised Souter's
experience but did not express an opinion on the nomination.
Mitchell promised Democrats would conduct prompt and fair hearings.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking Republican on the
Judiciary Committee, said he expected few if any fireworks over
Souter's record ``because he just went on the court in April.''
   When Bush nominated Souter for the appeals court, the American
Bar Association's screening committee called him ``well-qualified''
_ its highest rating for judicial nominees.
   Bush said he decided on Souter earlier in the day.
   ``The excellence was just there,'' Bush said.
   The president praised Brennan as well, calling the court's
long-time leading liberal, ``one of the greatest figures of his
age.''
   The 84-year-old Brennan, in frail health, resigned Friday.
Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he had served longer
than most Americans have been alive.

   An affiliate of the Church of Scientology on
Monday promised rewards of up to $10,000 for Internal Revenue
Service employees who turn in corrupt IRS officials.
   Representatives of the National Coalition of Whistleblowers,
carrying a 5-foot-high ``wanted'' poster, camped outside IRS
national headquarters and gave literature to IRS employees at
lunchtime.
   ``We want to assist those honest IRS employees who are aware of
corruption and abuses to come forward,'' said coalition spokesman
Mike Lashaway.
   IRS employees, he said, often are reluctant to report wrongdoing
despite laws to protect whistleblowers.
   The Church of Scientology and its branches have been involved in
several tax disputes with the IRS.
   The coalition, created by Scientologists to collect and
publicize information on IRS abuses, promised a $5,000 reward for
information leading to conviction of an IRS official for criminal
misconduct. Another $3,000 is added if the official is head of a
national department or an IRS district.
   An additional $2,000 will be tacked on if it can be proved that
the IRS internal inspection service was aware of the illegality and
didn't take actions required to stop it.
   The IRS declined comment on the reward offer.
   The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that fixed donations
to the church are not deductible by individual parishioners. A
district court in Boston held more recently that the IRS violated a
law setting out procedures for auditing churches when it
investigated the Church of Scientology.
   ``We think the exempt-organizations branch of the IRS has
discriminated against the church and individual Scientologists,''
said church spokeswoman Sylvia Stanard.

<HEAD>Poll: Statehood Gaining but Still Short of Majority</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly half of all Puerto Ricans
favor statehood over the Caribbean island's current commonwealth
status, and only 8 percent want independence, according to a poll
published Monday.
   Although support for statehood appears to be growing, the poll
found that it still falls short of the majority required by bills
now before Congress to change Puerto Rico's political relationship
with the United States.
   The survey of 1,204 eligible voters indicated that if Puerto
Rico held a plebiscite on its status now, 48.3 percent would choose
statehood, 40.6 percent commonwealth status and 8 percent
independence, with the remainder undecided.
   The poll was published Monday by San Juan's El Mundo newspaper.
   A previous poll, published by the newspaper El Nuevo Dia in
February, showed 43 percent favoring statehood, 36 percent
commonwealth status, 5 percent independence, with the remainder
undecided or refusing to reveal their preference.
   However, the two polls were conducted by different
organizations, which did not necessarily use the same methods.
   The Senate and the House are considering separate bills
authorizing a plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status in June 1991.
   Both bills would allow Puerto Ricans to choose whether they want
the island to become the 51st U.S. state, keep the commonwealth
relationship but with increased autonomy, or break away to form an
independent nation.
   The Senate version would put the results of the plebiscite into
immediate effect. The House version would require negotiations with
Congress over implementation of the islanders' choice.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, leader of the pro-commonwealth
Popular Democratic Party, proposed a status plebiscite in his 1989
inaugural speech following his re-election to a second consecutive
four-year term.
   Under the 38-year commonwealth arrangement, Puerto Rico's 3.3
million residents are U.S. citizens, but they pay no federal taxes
and cannot vote for president.
   Statehood supporters contend that the commonwealth status is a
form of colonialism that makes Puerto Ricans second-class citizens.
   Commonwealth supporters say the current status allows Puerto
Ricans to enjoy the benefits of citizenship without giving up their
Spanish cultural identity.
   Fear of economic collapse has stymied the independence movement.
   The El Mundo poll found that 43.5 percent of Puerto Ricans would
migrate to the U.S. mainland if the island became independent.
   The poll was carried out for El Mundo and the educational
station WMTJ-TV by the U.S. firm Frank I. Luntz &amp; Associates, based
in Arlington, Va., and had a margin of error of 2.8 percent.
   Findings were based on face-to-face interviews with randomly
selected eligible voters from June 23 to July 2.

<TEXT>
   Jamesport, Mo., was dying, like many
small American towns dependent on agriculture.
   Then, starting about five years ago, Jamesport began dressing up
its Main Street and attracting businesses that helped diversify the
economy and bring back some life.
   The revitalization of Jamesport, population 650, was held up as
an example Monday for community development experts assembled to
discuss, among other issues, the plight of small towns.
   ``Historically, we've thought the community's answers were
external,'' said Don W. Littrell, an associate professor at the
University of Missouri. ``Basically, now, what we're saying is, `Do
it yourself.'''
   Littrell is among 350 experts in Little Rock this week for the
22nd annual conference of the Community Development Society. The
group exchanges ideas to help solve community problems.
   Residents of Jamesport, a small agricultural trade center in
northern Missouri, began renovating and restoring Main Street
businesses about five years ago, City Clerk Cecelia Dixon said in a
telephone interview. Many of the businesses are antique stores, or
offer antique-restoration services, she said.
   ``Before that, it was just like any other small town,'' Ms.
Dixon said. ``It was like a ghost town.''
   Like many small towns in rural America, Jamesport's tax base was
eroding and its agricultural economy was failing.
   Littrell said small towns often share common problems:
   _Young people leave for higher paying jobs in cities.
   _Funding for public schools drops as the tax bases erode.
   _Economies flounder as farming crises hit again and again.
   ``They're not only dying economically, they're dying
institutionally,'' said Littrell. ``You look at churches _ they
aren't well funded. You have to look at how this affects people
socially.
   ``There's no quick fix,'' Littrell said. ``Each community is
going to have to develop its resources on its own.''
   Carl Pedersen, principal officer of the United Nations' director
general's Office for Development and International Economic
Cooperation, was Monday's keynote speaker. He said environmental
problems, overpopulation and pollution that accompanies development
in many areas threaten to strip the planet of its resources.
   ``Making the wrong choices today will bring the earth into a
downward spiral,'' Pedersen said. ``The biggest enemy we face is
our material expectactions.''

   A disguised, anonymous man described as a former

to the Birmingham pub bombings for which six other people are

   The two bombings on Nov. 21, 1974, killed 21 people and injured
162 in the deadliest attack ever mounted by the Irish Republican
Army in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``There were only two of us,'' the man said. ``These six people
are innocent. I've never met these six guys before in my life.''
   He fashioned his own disguise for the Granada TV interview,
conducted in Ireland as part of the ``World in Action'' series. An
actor voiced over his words because it is illegal in Britain to
broadcast interviews with IRA members.
   The man pointed out on detailed floor plans where the bombs were
left in each pub, information the documentary said had not been
published before. He could describe the pubs' interiors in detail.
   Four of the ``Birmingham Six'' confessed to the bombings. But
the documentary said the confessions contained inaccuracies about
where the bombs were placed and provided few details about the
pubs' interiors.
   The six say they were beaten into confessing. Their cause has
been taken up by Amnesty International and the Irish government.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, quoted a
``World in Action'' spokesman _ not identified in accordance with
British practice _ as saying the anonymous man's identity was known
by authorities for years.
   A Granada documentary shown in March identified four alleged
bombers and said a fifth could not be identified ``for security
reasons.''
   None were among the Birmingham Six.
   The man in the latest documentary said he was told the targets
were nearby government buildings. ``I was assured that there would
be plenty of warning given and that civilians weren't the target,''
he said.
   The first bomb exploded within six minutes of an IRA warning
call to the police, the documentary said.
   ``There never will be, there never can be any justification for
taking the lives of innocent people. It's something I have to live
with.
   ``I've got to live with those nightmares,'' the man said.
   Authorities are conducting an inquiry in the case, ordered by
Home Secretary David Waddingtion.
   Britain in October freed the ``Guildford Four,'' who were
wrongly convicted 14 years earlier for an IRA bombing, after
revelations that police made up confessions in the case.

   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas killed 20
militiamen in attacks on two Andean towns, police said Monday.
   There were no reports of rebel casualties in the fighting.
Police said the clashes took place July 17 in Jaujin and Chichipon,
near the Maranon River, 210 miles north of Lima.
   Police did not arrive in the isolated towns until July 20. The
bodies of the militiamen had been left unburied and were badly
decomposed, according to police.
   Police gave the following description of the attacks:
   About 30 rebels killed 17 of the militiamen in a long firefight
in Jaujin, after earlier killing three soldiers in an attack on
Chichipon.
   The rebels were armed with assault rifles and machine guns while
the militiamen had a few old rifles but were armed mainly with
sticks and machetes.
   Drug traffickers are active in the area around Chichipon and
Jaujin, police said. The Shining Path often provides protection for
drug traffickers in return for arms and money.
   The Peruvian army has established militia groups throughout
mountain and jungle regions to allow villages to defend themselves
from rebels.
   The government says more than 19,000 people have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.
   The Shining Path, following the tactics of China's Mao Tse-tung,
is conducting a prolonged guerrilla campaign in the countryside and
aiming eventually at surrounding and strangling Peru's coastal
cities.

   Jury selection began Monday in the
trial of Ramon Salcido, the winery worker accused of killing seven
people, including his wife and two of his daughters.
   Detailed questionnaires were distributed to about 100 potential
jurors at the San Mateo County Courthouse. The trial was moved to
the county just south of San Francisco because of extensive
pretrial publicity in Sonoma County, north of the city.
   Defense attorneys asked the judge to consider moving the trial
again because a defense-commissioned survey found that many San
Mateo County residents believe Salcido is guilty. Despite
objections from prosecutors, the judge agreed to consider such a
request. However, defense attorneys said they would not seek
another change until after all prospective jurors were interviewed.
   Salcido, 29, is accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his
mother-in-law, her two daughters and a co-worker on April 14, 1989.
A third daughter, who was almost 3, survived a slashed throat and
has been living with a foster family.
   An interpreter translated the proceedings into Spanish for
Salcido, who was dressed in a conservative gray suit, his arms and
legs free of shackles. It was the first time Salcido appeared in
court without restraints and wearing something other than an orange
jail jump suit.
   The 88-item, 18-page jury questionnaire was designed to give a
view of each juror's family background, work experience, intellect,
personality and beliefs. Questions included inquiries about
hobbies, whether potential jurors have consulted a psychiatrist and
how they feel about viewing bloody photographs and videotapes.
   The questionnaire also asked respondents their views on the
death penalty.
   Judge Reginald Littrell said he had summoned 120 jurors for each
of the four days the court will be in session this week.
   The judge said jury selection is expected to take at least four
to five weeks.
   ``I don't want any person on there with a bias against my
client,'' said Sonoma County Public Defender Marteen Miller,
Salcido's main attorney.
   Prosecutor Peter Bumerts said: ``I'm just looking for ordinary
people who have common sense and can bring their life experiences
into the courtroom.''
   The defense survey found that nine of 10 San Mateo County
residents who know about the killings believe Salcido is definitely
or probably guilty.
   ``Everybody's heard about the case,'' Bumerts said. ``There's no
doubt about it.''
   Miller said he doesn't plan to dispute the facts in the case.
Salcido gave a full confession to police shortly after he was
arrested in Mexico, his native country.
   However, Miller said he plans to fight the death penalty by
contending that Salcido was drunk and on cocaine at the time of the
slayings and was mentally unbalanced.

   Up With People's clean-cut young performers have
sung and danced their way around the world many times since 1965.
This week, thousands of alumni are gathering to celebrate the
organization's 25th anniversary.
   J. Blanton Belk founded the musical goodwill troupe in an effort
to channel the idealism of the young and spread an upbeat message
of universal brotherhood during a disruptive era of civil rights
marches, anti-war protests and political assassinations.
   ``It was a very young world that wanted to have a say in what
happened to them, much more so than past generations, '' recalled
Belk, a former Navy officer.
   Since then, some 11,000 Up with People troubadours have
performed in virtually every country.
   More than 5,000 alumni from 41 countries are expected to attend
a four-day celebration, including concerts and slide shows, that
opens Wednesday at the Colorado Convention Center. The organization
takes on about 650 people aged 18 to 26 each year.
   President and Mrs. Bush serve as honorary co-chairmen for the
event but were not expected to attend, said spokesman Julie
Hammerstein said. A cast of Up With People performed at Bush's
inauguration last year.
   Speakers at a forum to discuss global concerns such as the
environment and political cooperation will include Belgian Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens, Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda, president of the
Toyota Motor Company, and Mexico's Oscar-winning filmmaker Manuel
Orango.
   Others expected to attend include Princess Margriet of the
Netherlands, former astronaut Eugene Cernan and Soviet journalist
Vladimir Pozner.
   The idea for Up With People stemmed from a 1965 summer youth
conference in Michigan, said Belk.
   ``It was a time when you really had to give young people
experience, and there was no bigger challenge in the '60s than go
give them a vehicle for their energy,'' he said.
   His Tucson, Ariz.-based organization is independent, nonprofit
and educational, and has no religious or political affiliations.
   The group's aim of ``building bridges of communication among
people of all nations'' has become easier in recent years, but many
barriers remain, Belk said.
   ``The Berlin Wall is coming down, fences are down, borders are
being crossed,'' he said. ``But there's still the walls of
misunderstanding, bigotry, prejudice and fear to overcome.''

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy was mauled
by a mountain lion in Glacier National Park Monday, officials said.
The lion was tracked down and killed.
   Park information officer Amy Vanderbilt said Scott O'Hare of
Dayton, Wyo., was flown by helicopter to Kalispell Regional
Hospital where he underwent surgery Monday afternoon for deep
lacerations and puncture wounds to the head, face, neck and right
arm.
   Hospital officials said O'Hare was in fair condition and added
that the injuries were not life-threatening.
   Vanderbilt said the attack occurred at the Apgar picnic area,
near the west entrance to the park and across the road from one of
the park's largest campgrounds.
   O'Hare and two other children were playing on the beach of
McDonald Lake about 11:30 a.m. when the lion apparently attacked
without reason, she said.
   One of the other children ran to get O'Hare's parents while the
second child attempted to scare the cat off by throwing rocks,
Vanderbilt said.
   The mountain lion ran away when O'Hare's parents, Richard and
Merry O'Hare, arrived on the beach.
   About 3{ hours after the attack, park rangers found and killed a
45- to 50-pound female yearling mountain lion less than 100 yards
from where the attack took place, Vanderbilt said.
   The carcass is being taken to Montana State University where
tests will be conducted to see if the animal might have had rabies.
   Rangers tracked the mountain lion, using a dog, and shot it with
a high-powered rifle.
   Vanderbilt said officials have no idea why the mountain lion
attacked. All indications are that the children did not provoke the
cat in any way, she said.
   Vanderbilt added that mountain lion sightings in the Apgar area
are not unusual, but no one has ever been attacked before.
   Confrontations, however, have been on the rise in western
Montana in the last several years. A young child was killed near
Evaro by a mountain lion last fall, and a game warden was forced to
kill another as it charged him near Bigfork two weeks ago. A third
mountain lion was trapped and removed from a heavily used nature
area in Missoula last week.

<TEXT>
   The man President Bush wants to become the
Supreme Court's 105th justice is hardly known outside New
Hampshire, but his state court work _ and those who know him _
suggest David Souter is a close-to-the-vest conservative judge.
   ``He does not pay any attention to the emotional, political
aspects'' of cases before him, said Stanley M. Brown, a Manchester,
N.H., lawyer and a former American Bar Association officer. ``He
doesn't go out blazing new pathways. That's not his forte.''
   Gordon Tiffany, like Souter a former New Hampshire attorney
general, said it is hard to classify Souter's judicial philosophy.
   ``Whether it's liberal or conservative, it's not the issue in
his mind. The issue in his mind is what was intended in the
Constitution,'' Tiffany said.
   Souter, a state trial judge for five years before serving on the
New Hampshire Supreme Court until last April 30, appears to have
had two political patrons _ Warren Rudman and John Sununu.
   Rudman is a moderate Republican senator from New Hampshire who
as state attorney general hired Souter. Sununu, a former governor
who elevated Souter to the state Supreme Court, is the conservative
White House chief of staff.
   Rudman once said Souter, who was considered a potential Supreme
Court nominee by the Reagan administration before Anthony M.
Kennedy's appointment in 1988, possesses ``the most brilliant legal
mind'' he had ever encountered.
   Souter has been serving as a judge on the Boston-based 1st U.S.
Circuit Court for less than three months.
   In state cases:
   _He was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state Supreme Court
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints.
The nation's highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this
year.
   _He was part of a 3-2 majority in a 1986 decision that allowed
the main owner of the Seabrook nuclear plant to sell bonds needed
to complete the long-entangled project. His court rejected appeals
from the state consumer advocate and several anti-Seabrook groups.
   _In one of the few civil rights cases in which Souter
participated, he joined the state Supreme Court's ruling in 1987
that said homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or
foster parents. But the state court said in that decision that
homosexuals may not be barred from running day-care centers.
   _As a state judge in 1983, he held a 3:45 a.m. hearing at the
request of then-Gov. Sununu and ordered state employes staging a
``sick-out'' over pay issues back to work under threat of
$5,000-a-day fines against their union.
   People for the American Way, a liberal group, said its review of
Souter's state Supreme Court record indicates he ``interprets
constitutional guarantees narrowly, especially in criminal cases.''
   The organization criticized him for an opinion that overturned a
sexual assault conviction. Souter held that the defendant should
have been allowed to present testimony that the victim behaved in a
sexually provocative manner toward several men in a tavern, the
group said.

<TEXT>
   David Hackett Souter, nominated Monday to
the U.S. Supreme Court, is known in his adopted home state as a
brilliant legal scholar, a diligent judge, a private man.
   Never married, he lives alone on the family farm near Weare,
N.H., where he moved from the Boston suburb of Melrose when he was
11. He's now 50.
   Like President Bush, who appointed him, Souter is an
Episcopalian and a Republican. He never served in the military.
   He belongs to the Appalachian Mountain Club and is in excellent
health, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time he was
nominated to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals this spring.
   He had a net worth of $621,252 at the end of 1989 _ including
$191,000 in ``autos and other personal property,'' $190,000 in
securities and $150,000 in real estate _ according to financial
records released Monday by the committee. He listed no liabilities.
   Bush said he wanted a justice who would rely on the Constitution
and not ``legislate from the bench.'' And the president seemed to
be getting what he wanted, judging from the comments of lawyers who
know Souter _ as well as from the few personal remarks of Souter's
that have made it into print.
   One of Souter's mentors, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., decribed
him Monday as ``a classic conservative with great reverence for the
Constitution and the law.''
   ``He has a small circle of very good friends and lives an almost
monastic life,'' Rudman said. ``If he has any fault, I believe it's
that he's worked too hard all his life. But that's the way he is.''
   Stanley M. Brown, a Manchester trial attorney, described Souter
as a cautious judge who ignores the political and emotional
consequences of each case when reaching a decision.
   ``If there is any weakness in the man, it is that he does not
pay any attention to the emotional, political aspects,'' Brown
said. ``You are not supposed to and he doesn't. ... He is not going
to create a Constitution.''
   And Rep. Charles G. Douglas, R-N.H., who served with Souter on
the New Hampshire Supreme Court from 1983 to 1985, said, ``There's
nobody with a keener mind, a better ability to read and digest
material and then write an opinion that will stick to the law,
interpret the law and not go rambling all over the countryside
willy-nilly.''
   Souter himself, in an interview in 1976, let a little of his own
feeling out in remarks linking language and the law.
   He said, ``The more we allow language to be debased, the more
free-swinging we are in our interpretation of legal language, the
more arbitrary and personal, not grounded in the constitutional
process.''
   As attorney general of New Hampshire, Souter told Senate
Judiciary Committee at the time he was nominated to the 1st Circuit
Court of Appeals this year, he took ``active opposition to attempts
to legalize casino gambling in New Hampshire and to the prosecution
of those who refused to end their occupation of the site of the
Seabrook nuclear plant in 1977.''
   Asked his view of ``judicial activism,'' Souter wrote: ``The
obligation of any judge is to decide the case before the court, and
the nature of the issue presented will largely determine the
appropriate scope of the principle on which its decision should
rest.''
   Souter attended Harvard College, then Oxford University, where
he was a Rhodes Scholar, and Harvard Law School, from which he was
graduated in 1966.
   If confirmed, he would be would be the first New Englander to
serve on the Supreme Court since the retirement of Justice Felix
Frankfurter in 1962. He would be the court's second Rhodes Scholar,
joining Justice Byron R. White.
   After law school, Souter spent two years with a prestigious firm
in Concord, then became an assistant state attorney general in
1968. Three years later he was appointed deputy attorney general,
and, in 1976, attorney general.
   Gov. Meldrim Thomson appointed him a superior court judge in
1978, and then-Gov. John Sununu, now White House chief of staff,
elevated him to the state Supreme Court in 1983. He was appointed
to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on April 30 and
began that job just last month.
   Boston-area lawyers praised Souter's intellect and willingness
to study a case.
   David Berman, an attorney from Medford, argued a case before
Souter in June that involved questions about whether the town of
Concord should pay for the education of a child suffering from
multiple disorders.
   ``The questions he asked were highly intelligent, questions both
of me and my adversaries. I was very impressed by the time he had
taken to study the case,'' Berman said.
   On the Judiciary Committee questionnaire earlier this year,
Souter was asked the 10 most significant cases he personally
litigated as deputy attorney general. He included his first case, a
``simple automobile collision case.''
   ``It was not significant for any novelty except to me, for it
was the first case I was allowed to try solo in the superior
court,'' Souter wrote. ``I had reason, despite my over-preparation,
to be grateful for the court's patience, and with equal
thankfulness I remember the opposing counsel, and even the opposing
party, for providing that first chance for me to stand up in a
courtroom all by myself.''

   Under the U.S. system of separation of powers,
it is the president's job to choose Supreme Court nominees and the
Senate's role to confirm or reject them.
   Twenty-seven high court nominees in the nation's history have
failed to win Senate confirmation, only seven in this century.
   Most recently, the Senate in 1987 blocked President Reagan's
appointment of Robert Bork to fill a vacancy created by the
retirement of Justice Lewis F. Powell.
   The Senate vote was 58-42, with six Republicans joining 52
Democrats in opposing Bork.
   Reagan's second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after
revealing he had smoked marijuana. The Senate then confirmed
Reagan's third pick, Anthony M. Kennedy.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dropped seven
ministers and appointed two close aides to posts in the Foreign
Office on Monday in a shakeup of the middle and junior ranks of her
government.
   The shuffle followed the July 14 resignation of Trade and
Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley, who quit after making
anti-German remarks.
   Ridley was replaced the same day by a former treasury official,
Peter Lilley, and Monday's moves involved no further changes in
Mrs. Thatcher's 22-member Cabinet.
   She moved or replaced about 20 lower-ranking ministers _ about a
fifth of the government members who hold jobs outside the Cabinet _
in the sixth shakeup in a year.
   In the most senior appointment, Mrs. Thatcher named Francis
Maude, 37, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Asian
affairs, as financial secretary to the Treasury to replace Lilley.
   Among three new appointees at the Foreign Officewere Mrs.
Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, Mark Lennox-Boyd, and
another staunch loyalist, Tristan Garel-Jones, a deputy whip in the
House of Commons.
   The shakeup, designed to freshen the government, was widely
expected even before Ridley resigned.

   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis
said Monday that the European Community would link economic
cooperation with Israel to the new Israeli government making
progress toward Middle East peace.
   De Michelis, president of the EC's Council of Ministers, made
the statement after the first meeting of the so-called troika of
European foreign ministers with Israel's new foreign minister,
David Levy of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The meeting came as European leaders are putting increasing
pressure on Israel to move toward peace with Palestinians, and as
Israel is seeking wider trade cooperation from Europe.
   De Michelis said the visiting Europeans foreign ministers, who
included Jacques F. Poos of Luxembourg and Gerard Collins of
Ireland, expressed to Israeli leaders their concerns about the
situation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Italian official told a news conference that the EC was
willing to support any initiative toward Middle East peace even if
it does not conform to one adopted by European leaders at a summit
last month.
   The summit in Dublin recommended an international peace
conference on the Middle East, including representatives from the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel views the PLO as a
terrorist organization and rejects the idea of an international
conference.
   ``We're open to examine all possibilities offered by all
parties, of course also by the Israeli government,'' De Michelis
said after the meeting.
   He said the EC would take into consideration Israel's views of
the PLO but that Israel would have to find another ``real
Palestinian interlocutor.''
   He also said, however, that European leaders were worried that
Middle East tensions could deteriorate dangerously unless steps
were taken quickly toward peace.
   When asked whether Israel would be granted crucial economic
concessions as the 12-nation EC moved toward a single market in
1992, De Michelis said that would depend on progress toward peace.
   ``If the peace process continues, there will be a jump in the
quality of economic cooperation in the entire region, and of course
Israel has a special place in that,'' he said.
   ``But,'' he added, ``if there is a deterioration, economic and
social cooperation will become more and more difficult.''
   De Michelis said the EC leaders were concerned that a wave of
Soviet Jews immigrating to Israel could adversely effect the 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Levy noted that Europe does not face the dangers that Israel
does in dealing with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors.
   The visit by the three foreign ministers was the first by EC
leaders to Israel since Prime Minister Yizthak Shamir formed a
right-wing government in June led by his Likud bloc.
   The three ministers are to meet Tuesday with Shamir before
traveling to Tunis for talks with the Arab League.

   The jury in the second McMartin Pre School
molestation trial announced it had reached a partial verdict
Monday, but was ordered to resume deliberations on 6 counts on
which it was deadlocked.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg allowed jurors to go
home for the night before resuming consideration of charges that
Raymond Buckey molested three girls at his family's nursery school
in the early 1980s.
   Weisberg disclosed in a brief court session that jurors had
asked for further legal instruction, but didn't explain further.
   It wasn't revealed what charges the jurors agreed on, or whether
they voted for conviction or acquittal.
   Jurors had said in a foreman's note the panel had considered all
eight charges twice before concluding that they were ``hung'' on
six counts.
   The judge urged them to deliberate further, telling them, ``Each
of you must decide the case for yourself and should do so after
deliberating with the other jurors.''
   All eight felony charges are child molestation.
   Outside court, Buckey said he was nervous but optimistic.
   ``Of course, I'm optimistic because I know the truth of my
innocence,'' he told reporters.
   Asked how he felt about the prospect of a third trial if the
jury hopelessly deadlocks, he said, ``I think everyone is tired of
the McMartin case. I think it should end.''
   The jury's announcement that verdicts had been reached came at
the start of the panel's third week of deliberations in a case that
has stretched over six years with two trials and lengthy
preliminary hearings.
   Buckey was acquitted along with his mother of a number of other
charges in the first trial.
   His second trial lasted three months, far shorter than the
first, which was the nation's longest criminal proceeding and cost
Los Angeles County $13.5 million.

<HEAD>Cardinal Ratzinger Attacks `Liberation Theology' on Rio Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the
pope's main guardian of orthodoxy, attacked Marxist-influenced
``liberation theology'' during a visit here Monday.
   The West German cardinal, chief of the Vatican's Sacred
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, came to Rio to open a
special weeklong course for Brazilian clergymen organized by the
local archdiocese.
   ``The Congregation does not condemn all `liberation theology'
but believes it is necessary to exclude a specific type, which is
influenced by Marxism,'' he told a news conference.
   ``Liberation theology,'' a grass-roots doctrine which promotes
social and political awareness among the poor, has a strong
following in Brazil, where the Roman Catholic clergy is considered
among the world's most liberal.
   Ratzinger said some liberal clergymen ``reduce faith to a
predetermined socio-political position.''
   ``They use the Church as a (political) party, and produce a
faith that is partial, and does not respond to all of humanity,''
he added.
   Ratzinger did not mention by name any clergymen he considered
proponents of Marxist-inspired liberation theology.
   The Vatican has come into open conflict with the Brazilian
church on several occasions in recent years.
   In 1988, Bishop Pedro Casaldaliga, known for his outspoken
defense of landless peasants in his diocese in the central state of
Mato Grosso, had restrictions placed on his visits to Central
America.
   Three years earlier, Leonardo Boff, internationally recognized
as a leading progressive theologian, was sentenced to a year's
``penitential silence'' for his criticism of church authority.

   State officials said Monday they have
distributed paychecks to more than half of the 18,500 state
employees whose salaries were overdue by up to 12 days because of a
switch to a new computer system.
   The state's finance director, Alexander Holmes, said he hoped
the problem of late payroll checks would be solved by July 31, when
another 30,000 state workers are due to be paid.
   Some unpaid workers said they had run out of money to buy food
or pay rent and utility bills.
   State payroll processors worked through the weekend, often until
midnight, to clear the backlog of paychecks. By Monday, the number
of overdue paychecks had been reduced to 9,600, Holmes said. More
than 60,000 people are employed by the state.
   Officials used a $166 million cash-flow reserve fund to pay off
workers, and used an older computer system to cut down on
processing difficulties caused by the recent switch to a new, $13
million computer system, Holmes said.
   Asked if the problems will be ironed out by July 31, Holmes
said: ``I have confidence in the system and the people who are
working to get it done.''
   He said the paycheck delays have been caused because the
programming in the new computer system is not working as fast as
expected and coded tapes coming in from various state agencies are
not in the proper form.
   Officials said some child support payments were being delayed
because of the computer problems. A home for mentally retarded
adults in Ardmore said it may have to shut down if state checks for
workers and clients are not received soon.

<TEXT>
   Parliament early Tuesday ratified a new
defense treaty with the United States that will allow two major
U.S. military bases to remain on the island of Crete for at least
eight more years.
   The Parliament's decision ends more than 18 months of
uncertainty about the future of the U.S. bases following the
expiration of the previous U.S.-Greece defense treaty in December
1988.
   The treaty has been a divisive issue in Greek politics _ with
conservatives supporting a continued U.S. military presence and
leftists demanding the removal of the bases.
   As lawmakers debated the treaty, hundreds of anti-base
demonstrators clashed with police Monday near the city of Khania on
Crete. Three policemen were slightly injured after being shot by
demonstrators, the Public Order Ministry said.
   The defense agreement, which was signed by representatives of
the two countries earlier this month, would take effect in
September and run through 1998.
   In Greece, the treaty will become law as soon as it is signed by
President Constantine Caramanlis and published in the government
gazette.
   A State Department official, requesting anonymity, said late
Monday that the United States considers the pact an executive
agreement, which would not require ratification by Congress.
   After an exchange of notes between the two countries, the
administration would only have to notify Congress about it within
60 days for it to take effect, the official said.
   The treaty continues a defense relationship between the two NATO
allies that began in 1953. The pact guarantees that the United
States will defend Greece from attack by a hostile country.
   The U.S. administration has also agreed to seek congressional
approval for an aid package that would provide Greece with about
$345 million in assistance to buy U.S. military equipment, supply
surplus planes and destroyers worth about $1 billion, and write off
about $50 million in past debts for military purchases.
   Parliament approved the defense treaty by the narrowest of
margins shortly after midnight Monday following a three-day debate.
   A simple majority of the 300-member Parliament was required for
ratification.
   All 151 deputies from the ruling conservative New Democratic
Party voted in favor of the treaty. It was opposed by 144
Communist, Socialist and environmentalist deputies. Four deputies
were absent and one abstained.
   The treaty allows the United States to continue operating two
major military bases on Crete _ a naval support facility at Souda
Bay and Iraklion Air Station near the village of Gournes.
   Two bases near Athens _ a Navy communications station at Nea
Makri and the Hellenikon Air Base _ have been slated for closing by
the Defense Department as a cost-cutting measure. Numerous relay
stations throughout Greece will also close.
   On Crete, a coalition of leftist groups opposed to the U.S.
bases staged demonstrations in Khania that lasted into the night.
As many as 2,500 people took part in the protests, according to
witnesses and journalists at the scene.
   Police fired tear gas to prevent demonstrators from entering a
municipal building to deliver a petition, the Public Order Ministry
said.
   Clashes then broke out, and three police officers suffered
gunshot wounds, the ministry said Monday night. Another five
officers were injured by gasoline bombs and stones hurled by
demonstrators, the ministry said.
   A hospital source said 10 civilians were treated for respiratory
problems caused by the tear bas, and another 40 people received
treatment for minor injuries.
   A police official in Khania said eight people were arrested
during the disturbances.
   Demonstrators set three police vehicles and part of the
municipal building on fire with gasoline bombs, lighted fires in
central Khania and engaged in repeated skirmishes with police late
into the night, witnesses said. Police fired into the air, they
said.
   The previous treaty expired in December 1988, but it was
extended as negotiations continued through several changes of
government in Greece.
   Seventeen rounds of talks under the socialist government of
Premier Andreas Papandreou proved fruitless. The talks were put on
hold last year when coalition governments held power.
   The conservative government, elected April 8, and the United
States reached agreement in principle on May 30 after two rounds of
talks.
   On Monday, Papandreou called for a referendum on the defense
agreement and warned it could hurt Greece's relations with nearby
countries.
   ``Crete is being turned into a fortress,'' he said. ``It
provides the possibility of (the United States) undertaking air
operations out of the NATO area, against countries of the Middle
East and North Africa.''
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis denied the agreement harmed
relations with other countries.

   An Associated Press story of July 19 on the
disappearance of minority farmers did not make clear the
relationship between the Minority Farmers Rights Act and the 1990
farm bill.
   The farm bill drafted by the House Agriculture Committee
authorizes $20 million for education and technical assistance
programs for minority farmers.
   The $20 million authorization was included in the bill at the
request of Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., and was taken from the Minority
Farmers Rights Act he introduced last month.
   The authorization includes $15 million in education and
technical assistance programs for minority farmers, and $5 million
for grants to historically black land grant colleges, Indian tribal
community colleges, Hispanic institutions of higher education and
Alaska cooperative colleges.
   Espy said he hopes to get the remainder of his Minority Farmers
Rights Act enacted into law next year.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr., D-Ga., who has introduced a similar
minority farmers rights bill in the Senate, said last week he hopes
to incorporate many of its provisions into the Senate version of
the 1990 Farm Bill.
   The legislation would establish policies in the Department of
Agriculture to end discrimination in the awarding of federal farm
benefits, create an affirmative action program within the
department and establish an appeals process for discrimination
compliants.

<HEAD>City Health Commissioner Shakes Up Department Over Pap Smear
Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Health Commissioner Woodrow A. Myers fired
a top aide and reassigned two others Monday in a sweeping
departmental shakeup prompted by the mishandling of Pap smear test
results.
   Calling it a ``betrayal of public trust,'' Myers told a news
conference that an investigation found a combination of
mismanagement and poor supervision led to ``critical delays'' in
notifying women tested at city-run clinics of findings that could
indicate they had cervical cancer.
   While no women apparently have died as a result of the
mishandling, Myers indicated that some could be at risk.
   In response to questions, he said the Health Department already
was facing at least one lawsuit, but refused to discuss it further
or to speculate on whether more legal actions may occur.
   The scandal, first brought to light in newspaper reports several
months ago, involved Pap tests administered to some 3,000 women at
city-run Sexually Transmitted Disease clinics. The tests were
allowed to accumulate for a year without lab analysis or notice of
the results to the patients.
   When the tests were finally read, 600 women were found to have
abnormalities, including 11 cases where cancerous cells were found
and 93 where pre-cancer conditions existed.
   All but two of 104 women whose test results were most ominous
have been located by the department, Myers said.
   He conceded there was a ``very low'' prospect for finding the
other two, one of whom he said had used a false name, while the
other was wanted by the FBI in an unrelated matter.
   Myers named a six-member panel in May to investigate the affair.
   In announcing its findings on Monday, he said it was apparent
that department policies since 1988 ``have resulted in an
outrageous insensitivity to women who rely on this department.
   ``The unconscionable delays were a betrayal of public trust.
This cannot continue.''
   Myers said Dr. Kenneth Dressler, former assistant commissioner
in the department's bureau of laboratories, had been fired, while
Norman Scherzer, former assistant commissioner for Epidemiology and
Prevention Services, and John Miles, former director of the
Sexually Transmitted Disease Department, were both being reassigned
within the department.
   Myers said a fourth official, Dr. Stephen Schultz, former deputy
commissioner for Epidemiology and Prevention Services, had been
reassigned earlier from administrative to clinical duties.
   In addition to those changes, Myers said he will appoint a new
Deputy Commissioner for Disease Intervention to oversee the process
and has agreed to have other Health Department programs reviewed by
state agencies.
   He said all of the tests that had gone unread have since been
analyzed, and department laboratories are now returning results
within a week. An outside lab is under contract to handle any
overload, to make sure that time frame is maintained, he added.

   The Navajo Supreme Court on Monday
denied suspended tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald's request to
remove the judge presiding over his election-fraud case.
   The trial is scheduled to start Tuesday before the tribe's
District Judge Robert Yazzie in Window Rock. But the tribe's
Supreme Court scheduled a hearing before the trial's start to
determine if MacDonald will have adequate legal counsel.
   MacDonald, who was put on paid leave by the Tribal Council,
faces 93 counts of election fraud in his 1986 re-election to the
tribe's chairmanship. The charges allege MacDonald filed a
fraudulent campaign report when he failed to report contributions
from non-Indians and Indians. The charges also allege the funds
received exceeded the maximum of $84,192 allowed.
   MacDonald asked the Supreme Court on Friday to remove Yazzie on
grounds of bias.
   ``The prosecutors know they have a judge who is already on their
side,'' MacDonald stated in a motion.
   MacDonald said Yazzie is biased against him because MacDonald
attempted to remove the judge from the bench and claimed advisory
counsel appointed by the judge is inadequate. MacDonald is acting
as his own attorney, but has lawyers for advisers.
   ``I am not a lawyer and do not know how to conduct a trial. The
special prosecutors want to make sure I cannot get a lawyer
appointed beyond the `cardboard-cutout' lawyers that Judge Yazzie
appointed in the last minute to make people think I am getting a
fair shake,'' MacDonald said in the motion.
   After the election-fraud trial, MacDonald still faces two
separate trials on charges of bribes and kickbacks and on
conspiracy charges in the tribe's purchase of a large ranch.
   A lawer previously retained by MacDonald bowed out, citing
health problems, and MacDonald has said was having difficulty
retaining replacement lawyers.
   Navajo Legal Aid Attorney Peter Breen and Farmington, N.M.,
private attorney Doug Moeller were appointed by Yazzie to advise
MacDonald.
   Breen said he planned to appear in court Tuesday, but Moeller
said he would stay away.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>AP Speeds Up PhotoStream and Picture Desk Schedules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press is accelerating
implementation of its PhotoStream network and installation of AP
Leaf Picture Desks, aiming to finish nationwide by the end of 1991,
a year earlier than previously announced.
   President Louis D. Boccardi said July 19 that the decision to
step up the schedule came in response to encouragement from member
newspapers to put the new photo system in place as soon as possible.
   Installations of PhotoStream and AP Leaf Picture Desks will
start in September in New York, the state in which AP will save the
most money by switching from land-line transmission to satellite
delivery of pictures.
   Installations will start in October in other Northeastern
states. In February, installations will commence simultaneously in
the three other divisions of the AP's domestic photo service _
Southeast, Central and West.
   Within each region, AP teams will work in more than one state at
a time, but the general order for installations is determined by
where the greatest savings can be made to help pay for the program.
   The original timetable had called for a 28-month installation
program. ``But development of hardware and software has proceeded
at a pace that indicates we should attempt to accomplish this
enormous task in 16 months,'' Boccardi said.
   He said the AP would give its members at least a quarterly
update on the progress of the installation program.
   In addition to the land-line savings, the Northeastern region is
the first to begin conversion because of its proximity to AP's
photo and computer headquarters in New York, AP's technical center
in New Jersey and Leaf Systems Inc. in Massachusetts, which
manufactures the AP Leaf Picture Desk.
   The New York region states, in order of installations, are: New
York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire and Connecticut.
   Installation in the other three regions will be in this general
order:
   Central: Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Iowa,
Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas,
Missouri, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Wyoming.
   West: California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New
Mexico, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Alaska and Hawaii.
   Southeast: Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia,
Florida, North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, South Carolina,
Maryland and Delaware.
   Additional photo editors will be hired for the control bureaus
of each region to edit and transmit pictures from bureaus and
newspapers in the states under their jurisdiction. Additional staff
also will be hired to install the darkrooms and train member
newspaper staffs. AP will set up a full-time Help Desk to assist
members with the changeover.
   Black and white pictures currently are transmitted in about nine
minutes and color in 30 minutes. When fully implemented,
PhotoStream will allow delivery of black and white pictures in one
minute and color in three minutes.
   The AP also announced it would use the AP Leaf Picture Desk for
its internal photo computer system and would discontinue
development and marketing of the AP VAX Picture Desk, which runs on
Digital Equipment Corp. computers.
   ``The AP Leaf Picture Desk exceeds our expectations in power,
speed and functionality,'' said John Reid, AP vice president and
director of communications and technology. ``Work on new features
is proceeding rapidly. Members attending ANPA-TEC saw the
difference and demonstrated an overwhelming preference for the
Leaf.''
   If an AP member newspaper does not want an AP Leaf Picture Desk,
it may keep its present photo receiver or accept a two-minute
receiver. Or it may choose to buy an electronic darkroom from
another company, in which case AP will provide a rebate of $47
weekly for five years, effective on the date the member would have
received its AP Leaf Picture Desk.
   The present photo receiver will be left in place at sites where
an AP Leaf Picture Desk is installed.
   Members receiving an AP Leaf Picture Desk and PhotoStream will
be assessed a surcharge of between $15 and $80 weekly, depending on
circulation.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Favor of Newspapers in Confidential Source Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper cannot be held liable for
breaking a promise of confidentiality to a source, the Minnesota
Supreme Court ruled in rejecting a $700,000 award against the
state's two biggest daily papers.
   Lawyers for both sides agreed the 4-2 ruling July 20 has
far-reaching implications for the nation's news organizations.
   The court rejected a jury's award of $200,000 in compensatory
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages to Dan Cohen.
   Cohen had sued the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis for 1982 stories identifying him as the source of
documents showing a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor
had been convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier.
   Cohen, then a Republican gubernatorial candidate's consultant,
had given the newspapers' reporters the information in return for
assurances of confidentiality. But the newspapers' editors
overruled the reporters, believing readers should know the
information came from the GOP candidate's campaign.
   The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court's dismissal of Cohen's
claim of fraudulent misrepresentation, but reversed the appeals
court's ruling allowing him to claim breach of contract.
   ``To impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship,
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that
ethical relationship,'' Associate Justice John Simonett wrote.
   The court also said enforcement of the promise of
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract
where none exists would violate the newspapers' First Amendment
rights.
   Cohen's lawyer, Elliot Rothenberg, said he would appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   The Associated Press filed the only friend-of-the-court brief in
the case. Cohen's victory at trial had produced a spate of similar
lawsuits around the country, the AP's attorneys said.
   The breach-of-contract theory was being used by plaintiffs
elsewhere to avoid the constitutional obstacles that stand in the
way of winning privacy and libel suits, said Dick Winfield, an
attorney for the AP.
   The Minnesota ruling is ``the first definitive opinion'' by a
state supreme court directly addressing the issue and the media
``can take considerable comfort'' in the case, he said.
   Joel R. Kramer, executive editor of the Star Tribune, said his
paper was ``especially pleased that the court has ruled that the
decision to publish true facts relating to the activities of `a
political source in a political campaign' is one that is protected
by the First Amendment.''
   But Bill Salisbury, the Pioneer Press reporter who accepted
Cohen's documents and objected strongly to his editors' decision to
identify Cohen as the source, said the ruling will make his job
more difficult.
   ``What the ruling tells reporters ... is that if an editor wants
to overrule your promise of anonymity to a source, he or she can do
so,'' Salisbury said. ``So, it will make me much more careful about
granting confidentialtiy to sources, and it will make me much more
reluctant to reveal the names of my sources to editors.''

<HEAD>Profit Down at Gannett, Times, Pulitzer; Scripps Has Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. reported a 6.1 percent decline in after-tax
profit for the second quarter, its first quarterly earnings dip in
22 years as a public company.
   Other companies reporting drops in net earnings were The New
York Times Co., 35 percent; Pulitzer Publishing Co., 34 percent;
McClatchy Newspapers Inc., 22 percent; and Multimedia Inc., 12.5
percent.
   E.W. Scripps Co. reported a loss for the quarter as a result of
a special charge for the cost of terminating a joint operating
agreement in Knoxville, Tenn.
   Media General Inc. said its second-quarter profit more than
doubled from a year ago, primarily because of a one-time gain from
the sale of its West Coast weekly newspapers and the receipt of
overdue newsprint royalties.
   Park Communications Inc. said its net profit inched higher.
   A weak advertising market hurt the newspaper operations of the
companies reporting this past week.
   ``It's the same problem the whole industry has _ the ad linage
numbers continue to be disappointing,'' Peter Appert, media
industry analyst for the investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell, said July 18.
   Retail advertising, which accounts for about half of the typical
newspaper's ad revenue, has been hurt because of industry
consolidation and severe financial woes at some major department
store chains.
   Classified advertising, which makes up about 40 percent of a
newspaper's ad revenue, has fallen as the economy has deteriorated
in parts of the country.

   Gannett's after-tax profit was $105.3 million for the
three-month period ended July 1, down from $112.1 million a year
earlier. Operating income fell 10 percent to $193.1 million from
$215.6 million. Revenue slipped 1 percent to $893.8 million from
$904.2 million.
   Gannett said newspaper ad revenue fell 4 percent to $497.5
million. Paid advertising pages at USA Today dropped 12 percent to
929 pages, but the company said rate increases and higher
readership boosted revenues.
   Broadcasting revenue slipped 1.1 percent to $108.6 million.
Outdoor ad revenues rose 6 percent to $72.4 million.
   For the first six months of the year, Gannett earned $180.3
million, down 4 percent from $187 million a year earlier. Revenue
slipped 1 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.72 billion.

   Times earned $26.8 million in the April-June quarter, compared

   Operating profit at the newspaper group fell 25.2 percent to
$50.1 million. Ad volume at The New York Times fell 13.4 percent,
with about 60 percent of the decline coming in classified
advertising. Ad volume at the regional newspapers rose 2.5 percent
for the quarter.
   The magazine group's operating profit plunged 88 percent to
$500,000 because of costs associated with the purchase of McCall's
magazine last August. Results were steady at the broadcasting and
information services segment.
   For the first six months, Times earned $43.4 million, down 42

   Scripps recorded a $162,000 loss for the quarter, compared with
a net profit of $25.2 million in the second quarter of 1989.
Revenue rose 3.4 percent to $332 million from $321 million.
   The loss reflected a $36.4 million pre-tax charge related to
payments the company will make to Persis Corp. to terminate the JOA
between Scripps' Knoxville News-Sentinel and The Knoxville Journal,
owned by Persis. Under the agreement, which ends in December 1991,
the News-Sentinel provides sales, production and distribution for
the Journal.
   Scripps said that without the charge, net income would have been
$23.5 million, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier.
   ``The soft advertising environment continues to impact revenue
growth, particularly in the newspaper group,'' Lawrence A. Leser,
Scripps' president and chief executive officer, said in a news
release July 17.
   For the first six months, Scripps' net income fell 76.2 percent
to $9.6 million from $40.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.2
percent to $629.4 million from $615.8 million.

   Media General earned $12.5 million in the quarter, compared with

million from $149.9 million.
   The results included an after-tax gain of $6.4 million from the
sale of its Golden West-Highlander weekly newspapers and past-due
royalties from its Mexican newsprint affiliate.
   The sluggish economic climate depressed both retail and
classified advertising at the company's newspapers. Ad revenues
also were down at the company's TV station, but strong growth in
its cable TV operation in Fairfax, Va., helped lift the revenue and
earnings for the broadcast division.
   For the first six months, Media General earned $15.1 million,
down 16 percent from $17.9 million in 1989. Revenue rose 1.7
percent to $151 million from $148.4 million.

from $121.0 million.
   The company said the drop in profit reflected a one-time loss of
$3.1 million from refinancing its long-term debt of $718 million as
well as sluggish retail and automotive advertising.
   For the first six months, Multimedia's net profit totaled $15.7

percent to $107.6 million from $97.3 million.
   McClatchy blamed the profit decline on startup losses from a

   Pulitzer said profit also was affected by depreciation and

<HEAD>Management Employee Misappropriated $900,000, Tribune Co. Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Co. said it fired its marketing director
for the alleged misuse of an estimated $900,000 and referred the
case to federal prosecutors.
   No criminal charges had been filed against Robert Dickey, who
had worked for Tribune and its affiliates for 13 years. The company
declined to give details on the alleged misappropriation of funds.
   However, the Chicago Tribune, a subsidiary of the company,
reported July 18 that a source it did not identify contended the
dismissal stemmed from regular payments to a Chicago-based vendor.
   The payments were made when Dickey was marketing director of the
Tribune and ceased when he was promoted to the parent company last
fall, the newspaper said, citing the source.
   Dickey's lawyer, James Montana Jr., said Dickey was cooperating
with the company's investigation. Dickey declined to discuss the
case.
   Joseph Hays, a Tribune Co. spokesman, said Dickey was fired July
16.
   ``We cannot comment further on the matter at this time, except
to say that an internal investigation is continuing,'' Hays said.
``No criminal charges have been filed, but the matter has been

<HEAD>Report Forecasts 7.6 Percent Growth in Media Revenues Through 1994</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media revenues will grow at a 7.6 percent yearly
rate to $461.3 billion by 1994, exceeding growth in the economy but
slowing from its 8.9 percent pace of the past five years, a study
said July 22.
   But the report from the investment banking firm Veronis Suhler &amp;
Associates, which specializes in media deals, predicted revenues
will rise faster for newspapers and broadcasters.
   In its fourth annual industry forecast, the firm said overall
revenues will grow more slowly because of ``maturation of the
technology-driven industries of the 1980s'' such as home video,
cable TV, compact disc recordings and business information.
   Among the report's predictions:
   _Newspaper revenues will rise at a 6.7 percent annual rate over
the next five years to $61.8 billion in 1994, up from a 6.3 percent
annual rate the past half-decade. Annual growth at weekly
newspapers will outpace growth at dailies, 7.9 percent to 6.6
percent.
   _TV revenues will grow 6.8 percent a year to $33.9 billion in
1994, up from 5.8 percent. Network TV, which rose at a slim 2.2
percent annual rate the past five years, will grow at a 6.6 percent
annual pace. Growth at local TV stations will slow to 6.9 percent a
year from 7.5 percent.
   _Radio will see growth of 8 percent a year to $12.3 billion by
1994, up from 7.6 percent. Cable TV will grow 8 percent annually to
$19.5 billion in 1994, down from 12 percent.

<HEAD>USA Today Says Financier Skewed Results of Poll on Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner Jr.
skewed results of a call-in telephone poll on Donald Trump, USA
Today said.
   The newspaper said July 19 that an independent analysis of the
call-in results to its ``Trump hot line'' June 8-10 found that
5,640 of 7,802 calls came from two phone numbers at Great American
Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Lindner's American Financial Corp.
   Lindner would not comment, the newspaper said, but a spokeswoman
for him said the calls were made because Lindner and others at the
company admire Trump's ``entrepreneurial spirit.''
   The newspaper said it studied phone records generated by Airdata
Inc., a call-in service company, because of some apparent
last-minute ballot-stuffing. From 5 to 6 p.m. EDT on June 10, the
final hour of the three-day call-in period, more than 1,000 calls
poured in. Ninety-three percent of those calls were pro-Trump, the
newspaper said.
   Callers were asked to say which statement they agreed with:
``Donald Trump symbolizes what makes the USA a great country'' or
``Donald Trump symbolizes the things that are wrong with this
country.''
   Trump won in a ``landslide,'' with 5,215 votes, or 81 percent,
agreeing with the first statement despite Trump's recent financial
and marital problems. The second statement got 1,191 votes, or 19
percent of the 6,406 callers who cast votes.
   USA Today said it would take steps to prevent such skewed
results in the future, while guaranteeing callers' privacy.

<HEAD>Boston Globe Files Suit Against Tax Package</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Globe filed the first legal challenge
to the state's new tax package July 19, claiming it is
unconstitutional to tax the materials used to publish a newspaper.
   The tax package, which became law a day earlier, not only
broadens the 5 percent sales tax to hundreds of business services,
it also extends the tax to the materials and equipment used to
publish a newspaper or transmit a broadcast.
   The Globe's suit in Supreme Judicial Court did not raise the
issue of broadcasters. Instead, the Globe argued Massachusetts law
exempts manufacturers from paying a sales tax on raw materials and
tools used in production, and thus it would be discriminatory to
apply such a tax to newspaper companies.
   ``Newspaper publishers are the only manufacturers of tangible
personal property excluded from the manufacturing exemptions,'' the
lawsuit said.
   The Globe also argued the tax law opens the possibility of
``burdensome taxation'' on the press that could obstruct critical
comment about the government.
   Robert Mehrman, head of the Massachusetts Broadcasters
Association, said he could not discuss whether radio and television
stations also would file suit against the tax.
   The Globe's suit pointed to a similar tax that was enacted in
Minnesota and struck down in 1983 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Minnesota taxed the ink and paper used by publishers while other
businesses using those products were not subject to the tax. The
Supreme Court said ``differential taxation of the press'' ran
counter to the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and said
the state did not show a compelling reason to permit the tax.

   Some readers of The New York Times were treated
to the debut of a writer they never knew existed: Fake Byline.
   Byline's first _ and, the Times hopes, last _ appearance in the

smaller type, it said, ``Special to The New York Times.''
   ``The story was not supposed to have a byline on it, but our
computer format doesn't work without one,'' explained Times
spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen. ``We plug in `Fake Byline' so the format
works. It's supposed to be deleted, but ...''
   An inexperienced computer operator, unsure of working the
equipment, failed to remove the bogus byline and out it went, she
said.
   The byline did not appear in all editions, so it was not known
how many readers saw the glitch, she said.

<HEAD>Paper's Coupon Campaign Against Drug Suspects Goes Statewide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Virginians can join the war on
drugs by using coupons to send tips to authorities under a
statewide program that is an offshoot of a campaign by the
Williamson Daily News.
   In announcing the program July 16, state police hailed it as a
new wave in citizen crimefighting, but civil libertarians warned
that the program _ under which tips can be mailed or phoned in
anonymously _ will create a society in which people spy on each
other.
   The program was adapted from one used by the Daily News.
Authorities received nearly 700 replies after the paper printed
coupons on its own and invited people to mail them to state police.
   Federal, state and local authorities arrested 46 people in Mingo
County as a result of the coupon tips in June. Wally Warden, editor
of the newspaper, said six people had been convicted so far.
   The Daily News got the idea from the Clinton (Iowa) Herald,
which asked readers to anonymously list the names of anyone they
suspect of using or selling drugs. The Milford (Conn.) Citizen also
has run a similar campaign.
   Warden said his paper had been contacted by law enforcement
agencies in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas for information about the program.

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Convention Fires News Editors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two top editors of the Southern Baptist
Convention's press agency were fired after they refused to resign.
   The denomination's executive committee voted July 17 to fire
Baptist Press editor Alvin C. Shackleford and news director Dan
Martin. Shackleford had worked at Baptist Press for 3{ years and
Martin for nearly a decade.
   Shackleford said they were not given exact reasons for the
dismissals, but said he believed the ruling fundamentalists felt
the journalists were biased against the majority view.
   Committee members refused to comment, saying only that Chairman
Sam W. Pace had ordered them to refrain from discussing the matter
outside the session, which was closed to the public. Some committee
members had charged the Baptist Press with supporting the
denomination's moderate wing.
   Nashville attorney Jeffrey Mobley announced later that a new,
independent press agency to be called Associated Baptist Press was
being formed.
   ``It will not seek sponsorship or affiliation with the Southern
Baptist Convention,'' Mobley said. ``It will be a stand-alone news
agency that will report on issues to people interested in Southern
Baptist affairs.''
   The 44-year-old Baptist Press sends stories and press releases
to about 400 clients, including 38 independent Southern Baptist
weekly newspapers.
   The executive committee didn't say whether replacements had been
hired. It gave the two editors seven months' severance pay and
benefits.

<HEAD>Feds Examining Possible News Agency Leak of Jobless Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is looking into the
possibility that its June unemployment report was leaked to traders
in financial markets by an unidentified news service.
   The matter involves the monthly report released July 6 on
unemployment in June but is not a formal investigation, spokesman
Bob Zachariasiewicz said July 18.
   He said the department was merely studying a report that the
information had been leaked early and caused a fluctuation in
market activity.
   When the report is released each month, news organizations are
given copies at 8 a.m. on the condition that the contents not be
released until 8:30 a.m. Markets can rise or fall based on this
information, and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn
the department's ire in the past.
   Zachariasiewicz declined to say which news organization was
being reviewed but another Labor Department source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was a Japanese service.
   The department recently cautioned Japanese news organizations in
advance of the release of its report on producer prices, the source
said.
   ``We've been having some trouble with the Japanese,'' the source

<HEAD>Newsweek Paid $60 to Prostitute Who `Confessed' to AIDS Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsweek paid a prostitute $60 to tell
her story of selling sex while infected with AIDS, the magazine
said July 18. The woman says she was ``dope sick'' and lied to get
the money.
   The article led to the arrest of the woman, Linda Kean, by
police who wanted her charged with attempted murder for knowingly
exposing her customers to AIDS. But she was released July 17 after
Alameda County prosecutors decided they lacked evidence to press
the charge.
   Newsweek included her story in a June 25 article about AIDS.
   Despite a magazine policy against it, Kean was paid $60 after
posing for a photograph and telling her story, Newsweek spokeswoman
Karen Wheeler said.
   ``In this case, after the photo was shot, the subject was given
$60,'' Wheeler said. ``Immediately after this was discovered by the
top editors, they reminded all concerned of the magazine's
commitment to that policy.''

<HEAD>Movies Move In on Defunct L.A. Newspaper Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The printing press and ornate lobby are real,
and so is the city editor's desk. The gunshots and blood are not.
   Movie makers are finding a bonanza in the unusual settings of
the Spanish Renaissance landmark that once housed the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner.
   At least a dozen productions, not counting commercials, have
been filmed at the domed building since the newspaper folded last
Nov. 2, according to city permit files.
   Clint Eastwood moved in for Warner Bros.' soon-to-be-released
movie ``The Rookie.'' So did Universal's ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ``It's really an ideal place for filming,'' said Ken Johnson,
site coordinator for Hollywood Location Co. ``There's such a wide
variety of spaces and looks ... directors of photography just love
the windows in the mail room.''
   Completed in 1915, the faded pink palace was designed by Julia
Morgan, who created William Randolph Hearst's castle at San Simeon.
The newspaper building sprawls over more than half a city block.
   Movie and commercial making will continue at least into the
fall, said Maxwell McCrohon, the former Herald Examiner editor. He
said Hearst Corp. had no plans to sell the building but was
considering renting it to full-time tenants.
   The ornate lobby has been an exclusive men's club and a hotel. A
stenciled notice to inmates makes a newsroom pass for a prison
dayroom. Around the corner, there's a detective squad room; you can
tell by the ``Robbery-Homicide'' plate on the city editor's desk.
   Sometimes the building shapes a movie.
   ``Occasionally they'll still be writing when they scout a
location and see something with such good production values that
they'll rewrite the script to get it in,'' said Johnson.
   He said a look at the row of hulking presses was enough to send
script writers back to work on the TV movie ``Rainbow Drive.'' The
bad guy wound up meeting his end being crunched in Press No. 9,
still grimy with Herald Examiner ink.

<HEAD>Proposed Uniform Libel Law for States Criticized for Alleged Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed uniform libel law under which courts
would decide whether statements are true or false before
determining appropriate damages would not guarantee First Amendment
rights for defendants, critics say.
   The Uniform Defamation Act is the first proposal for a
nationwide standard in libel disputes. It was discussed July 20 by
the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, a
group appointed by the nation's governors to draft model
legislation.
   The 28-page draft outlines a two-stage procedure for libel
trials. A court would first determine whether a statement under
question was true or false. Only later _ during the trial's second
stage _ would a court decide what, if any, damages to assess.
   Safeguards for the press _ protection if a reporter acted
without malice or allowances made if a plaintiff is a public
official _ would not apply in the trial's first stage.
   The committee said the draft was based on the premise that
plaintiffs are more interested in clearing their names than in
receiving damages.
   Harvey Perlman, dean of the University of Nebraska's College of
Law and author of the draft, said the proposed law's intent was to
protect plaintiffs' reputations better, but it also would benefit
news organizations.
   Under the proposal, news organizations could print retractions
or pay a plaintiff's legal fees after the first stage _ a provision
proponents say would shorten trials and reduce the amount of
damages awarded.
   ``We wanted to create some incentives for the plaintiff to stop
early,'' Perlman said.
   But critics argue the committee's desire to design safeguards
for a person's reputation would create a ``chilling effect'' on the
First Amendment.
   ``One of our central concerns is the committee's desire to move
the law in favor of the plaintiff,'' said Henry R. Kaufman, counsel
for the Libel Defense Resource Center. ``There will be a chilling
effect if the media believes it is going to face higher costs and
greater burdens of libel and litigation.''
   Others at the annual conference questioned creating one standard
for an intricate field of First Amendment law and court decisions.
   ``I don't feel it's an area of the law where you can provide a
uniform act,'' said John McClaugherty, a lawyer from Charleston,
W.Va. ``The First Amendment is constantly being reinterpreted and
by the time a law was passed it would already be out of date.''
   The earliest a proposal would be redrafted and returned to the
350-member conference would be next year, Perlman said, but no date
was set for a vote.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Claim of First Amendment Privilege for TV Outtakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine's highest court rejected a
television station's attempt to withhold portions of a videotaped
interview sought by a prosecutor as evidence in a criminal
investigation.
   Officials of WCSH-TV declined to comment on the July 20 ruling,
saying they would meet with the station's lawyers to plan their
next move.
   In its unanimous decision, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court
dismissed the station's assertion that First Amendment guarantees
of a free press established a ``qualified privilege'' to protect
the portions of the interview with Biddeford Police Commissioner
Denis Letellier that were not broadcast.
   The justices said it was essential a York County grand jury view
the full 12-minute tape as part of its investigation into
allegations that Letellier used his position to get a motor vehicle
charge against his son reduced.
   After the tape was subpoenaed, the station turned over the 2{
minutes of the interview that appeared on the air, but withheld the
unused portions.
   The court based its ruling on a 1972 decision by a divided U.S.
Supreme Court that said a ``a proper balance'' must be struck on a
case-by-case basis between freedom of the press and the obligation
of all citizens to provide relevant testimony about criminal
conduct.
   ``The public interest in the integrity of the Biddeford police
and city officials and in the effectiveness of the York County
grand jury proceedings far outweighs any discernible impairment
that the required production of the nonconfidential Letellier
videotape outtakes might conceivably cause to the First Amendment
interests asserted'' by WCSH, Chief Justice Vincent L. McKusick
wrote.

against television personality Geraldo Rivera by a woman who was
arrested during a drug raid carried live on national television.
   The 1987 suit by Terry Rouse of Channelview said she was falsely
portrayed as a prostitute and drug seller by Rivera's Dec. 2, 1986,
telecast of ``American Vice: The Doping of a Nation.''
   The settlement, involving an undisclosed amount of money, came
after Rivera was questioned for six hours during a deposition July
19. The lawsuit had been scheduled to go to trial Aug. 20.
   During the 1986 program, Rivera broadcast live outside a duplex
where Ms. Rouse was staying when sheriff's deputies raided the
home. Rivera said the people inside were an alleged pimp and
prostitute who were supplying drugs to truckers.
   Ms. Rouse was dragged from the duplex and handcuffed as an
estimated 15 million viewers watched, she said in the lawsuit.
   Ms. Rouse has maintained she was hired to paint the house, which
belonged to a friend. Cocaine possession charges against her
stemming from the televised bust were dismissed.

<HEAD>Former Official Resolves Libel Suit With UPI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former state official Larry Mehau and United
Press International resolved a 13-year-old libel lawsuit stemming
from allegations linking Mehau to organized crime, lawyers said
July 19.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit last September, saying UPI
was protected by the ``neutral reporting doctrine.'' The judge also
said Mehau, now a rancher, failed to prove the news report false.
   Mehau appealed the decision, and the case was sent to mediation.
   Under the settlement, UPI will make a charitable donation with
some of the money it would have spent on continuing the legal
battle, according to a joint statement from Mehau and UPI's
attorneys.
   The 1977 story in dispute quoted an article in the now-defunct
Valley Isle newspaper on Maui. The newspaper implied that
underworld figures had killed Hawaiian environmental activist
George Helm.
   UPI reporter Dennis Stone filed a story based on the newspaper
report and an interview with Helm's father. The story quoted Helm's
relatives as saying the missing activist had been threatened by
Mehau, then a member of the state Board of Land and Natural
Resources.
   The story also said Helm's brother, Adolph, identified Mehau as
the ``godfather'' of organized crime in Hawaii.
   Mehau sued UPI, but lost two years later at the trial level. The
state Supreme Court reversed the decision on appeal, concluding
Stone acted with actual malice, and the case moved into the federal
courts, where it was thrown out last year.

<HEAD>Arts Society Files Libel Suit Against Florida Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUART, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Performing Arts Society of Stuart filed
a libel suit July 16 against The Stuart News and its entertainment
editor, saying the newspaper published a ``campaign of falsehoods''
designed to wreck the society's image.
   The non-profit society, headed by Dorothy Nabutovsky of Palm
City, brings nationally known performing artists to Stuart and is
trying to raise $12 million to build a 2,250-seat concert hall
south of the city.
   On May 27, the News published the results of an investigation by
entertainment editor Jon Pine that said the society exaggerated
fund-raising claims, filed incorrect reports with state agencies
and thwarted inspection of public documents.
   Pine wrote followup articles about a state investigation into
the society's operations and an eviction action involving the
office where the society had done business.
   ``The words themselves have caused (the society) to be regarded
with scorn, contempt, ridicule and disrespect by the community and
will continue to for the foreseeable future as they attack the
society's reputation in the conduct of its affairs,'' according to
the suit filed in Martin Circuit Court.
   The suit seeks more than $5,000 in damages on each of three
counts. Stephen Papy, a Miami lawyer, said donations and ticket
sales had dropped because of the articles.
   The News reported June 30 that an investigation by the state
attorney general's consumer protection and fair trade practices
unit found the society was operating within the law.
   Assistant Attorney General Mark Barnett said then: ``Do things
look fishy? Definitely. There are things that should raise
questions in donors' minds. Is it illegal? No, not under the
current laws.''
   Pine, a reporter at the News since January 1988, said he stands
by his stories. ``I am very confident that the information
contained in them is factual and was presented without bias or
malice,'' he said.
   Thomas E. Weber, editor and president of the News, agreed.
   ``I think the suit is a measure of how far off the track the
Performing Arts Society has veered. There must be a better way for
the society to use its resources than to sue the newspaper,'' Weber
said.

<HEAD>Eastwood Can Continue $20 Million Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled July 20 that Clint Eastwood can
pursue a $20 million lawsuit against a national tabloid over a
report that the actor was threatened by neo-Nazis.
   Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow gave The Globe 20 days to
respond to the suit's allegations.
   Eastwood contends an article in the tabloid's Jan. 2 edition was
false and caused him mental anguish by making him fear for his
life. The lawsuit also alleges an invasion of privacy in portraying
the actor falsely.
   The Globe stands by the story's accuracy, said Anthony Glassman,
a lawyer for the Florida-based paper.
   The Globe reported that Eastwood had received death threats and
that a $100,000 bounty was placed on his life after he refused to
speak at a convention of the Aryan Nations, a white supremacy group.
   ``Our position was simply that to be the enemy of American Nazis
is not a bad thing. It's not offensive,'' Glassman said. ``He
(Eastwood) claims, though, that he suffered emotional distress as a
consequence of being put in fear that someone might act on that ..
. that it might cause someone to go out and try to collect the
bounty.''

<HEAD>Publisher Wins Right To Seek Damages for Bike Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper publisher who also is a
bicycling champion has won the right to seek damages from the state
for injuries he suffered in an accident on a highway bicycle path
in 1985.
   In a 5-2 decision July 16, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed
an appeals court ruling that had been based on an earlier case
granting immunity to the state for injuries that occurred on a bike
path separate from the road.
   ``The alleged defect in this case occurred upon a bicycle path
that unquestionably comprised part of the improved portion of the
highway designed for vehicular travel and not on an installation
separated and detached from the improved portion,'' Justice James
Brickley wrote.
   Gregg, publisher of The Daily Press in Escanaba, was training on
his racing bike Sept. 10, 1985, in Delta County's Ford River
Township. The paved path was along Michigan 35 between the road
used by cars and its shoulder, separated only by painted white
lines.
   While going about 27 mph, Gregg's bike struck a pothole and he
was catapulted forward. He fractured his skull though he was
wearing a helmet and broke several other bones. He now has epilepsy.
   The Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court of Claims in
Ingham County to determine liability and damages.

<HEAD>Philippine Broadcasters Provided Lifelines After Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Karen Yee wanted to tell her
uncles she was safe after a devastating earthquake, she turned to
the local radio station in Baguio to get the message through.
   When Red Cross official Richard Gordon needed to confer with
authorities in quake-damaged Cabanatuan, he did so in a telephone
patch provided by another radio station, which broadcast the
consultations live.
   In the aftermath of the July 16 earthquake, which left hundreds
of people dead, radio and television stations didn't only report
the news. They helped rescuers and worried relatives circumvent
poor communications and served as a spur to a clumsy, unresponsive
bureaucracy.
   Broadcasters directed rescuers to areas of destruction, relayed
messages to family members separated by the disaster and solicited
relief goods.
   ``It was the radio stations which were coordinating rescue
efforts, broacasting the need for blood, blankets, medicines,
earth-moving equipment,'' columnist Luis Beltran wrote in The
Manila Standard. ``Government departments went to them for guidance
on what to send, where to send.''
   After the quake struck, provincial affiliates of the major
networks broadcast the first reports of destruction. At that time,
President Corazon Aquino's staff said only that it was ``studying
the extent'' of the disaster.
   Provincial officials, unable to get through to Manila by
telephone, broadcast appeals to the capital for assistance over
private stations.
   Radio and television reporters traveled through the affected
area and briefed government officials about which towns and cities
were in urgent need of help.
   ``They served as effective alternatives to government agencies
whose addiction to routine has robbed them of the power of
initiative and the ability to respond quickly,'' former Labor
Minister Blas Ople wrote in The Manila Bulletin.
   As the extent of the disaster became clearer, stations
discontinued regular programming for round-the-clock quake coverage.
   ``We shifted to public-service priority programming because we
feel that that is the need of the present time,'' said Maria
Asuncion Lanuza, program coordinator of DZBB. ``I think we are
complementing the government.''

<HEAD>Soviet Broadcasting Chief Fears `Orgy of Democracy'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Soviet television and radio says he
fears ``an orgy of democracy'' now that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
loosened controls on the state broadcasting monopoly.
   Mikhail F. Nenashev, the chief of Gostelradio and a Communist
Party traditionalist, said in an interview broadcast on Soviet TV
that the change will make ``managing television ... much more
complex than in the past.''
   The interview was broadcast July 16, the day after Gorbachev
issued his ``Presidential Decree on Democratization of Television
and Radio'' to cut back on the Communist Party's monopoly on the
airwaves.
   Until now, only groups approved by a state committee had access
to Soviet television. As a result, the Communist Party received
large segments of time on the airwaves.
   ``For a lasting time the television was under the party
influence, what we used to call and still call the party
monopoly,'' said Nenashev, who formerly was head of the state
publishing committee.
   ``Now I am more afraid of an orgy of democracy rather than the
party monopoly, when the monopoly is replaced by numerous demands
put forth by various groups, parties, various councils, various
organs,'' he said.
   Hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Reporter's `Confession' Led to Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farzad Bazoft, the Iranian-born journalist who was
hanged in Iraq after being convicted of espionage, might have saved
his life if he had refused to make the confession his captors
demanded, The Observer said July 22.
   Bazoft ``believed his interrogators when they told him he would
be released if he confessed,'' said the newspaper, which employed
Bazoft at the time of his arrest.
   Bazoft, 31, was executed March 15.
   Daphne Parish, the British nurse accused with him, refused to
make a confession and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. She was
freed July 16 after intervention by Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda.
   After her release she told reporters that she was innocent and
that Bazoft was not a spy.
   Bazoft went to Iraq from London on an official press visit in
the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war. While there, he investigated
reports of a huge explosion at a military installation south of
Baghdad.
   Mrs. Parish, who was working in a Baghdad hospital, said Bazoft
asked her to drive him to the site, and took pictures and collected
dust samples. Both were arrested later.
   The Observer said that when Mrs. Parish refused to confess,
interrogators kicked her, pulled her hair, threatened her with a
rubber hose, held a knife in front of her and blindfolded her.
   The report said she was shown a videotape of Bazoft's confession
and when she met him again, she asked why he had done it. He
replied: ``Because of the electric shocks. They gave me a prepared
statement.''
   Both pleaded innocent at their trial by a military court, the
paper said.

   An appeals court has upheld the conviction
of the publisher and the former managing editor of a leading Greek
daily in the phone-tapping of The New York Times' bureau in Athens,
a court spokesman said.
   The three-member court sentenced the two men to 20 days in jail,

fine was not disclosed.
   Under Greek law, people convicted in cases not related to
narcotics may pay to reduce or eliminate their prison terms if the
terms are less than 18 months.
   The decision upheld the conviction of Ethnos Publisher George
Bobolas and former managing editor Alekos Filippopoulos in May
1985, the spokesman said.
   Bobolas and Filippopoulos were found guilty of providing the
former socialist government of Premier Andreas Papandreou with
tapes of conversations tapped at the home and office of a

<HEAD>Radical Iranian Newspaper Accuses Western Reporters of Spying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Iranian newspaper said July 16
that many Western reporters sent to cover events in Iran were spies
and warned the government to beware.
   The Persian-language Jomhuri Islami, which reflects the views of
government hard-liners, said many Western journalists visited Iran
``to fulfill their missions assigned by the Zionists and Western
spying agencies.''
   The article, which was obtained by The Associated Press in
Cyprus, blamed officials of the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, which
is in charge of regulating the activities of foreign reporters, for
giving reporters too much freedom on their trips to Iran.
   Journalists who visit Iran are assigned agents from the ministry
who accompany them on all trips outside their hotels. Reporters are
also required to submit their film and tapes to ministry officials
for approval.
   ``It is simplicity if we think that the CIA, the (Israeli)
Mossad and other intelligence services simply use one device to
obtain information from Iran,'' the newspaper said. ``In addition
to their set formula, they send reporters, photographers and
cameramen as a cover-up.''
   The Iranian government allows few Western news organizations to
base representatives in Iran and other reporters are allowed to
visit the country only on special occassions. Recently, reporters
were allowed in to cover the first anniversary of the death of
Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the June
earthquake that left about 40,000 people dead.
   Among the examples cited by the newspaper of ``non-journalistic
activities'' during the visits:
   _A reporter from a major British televsion network tried to take
an unauthorized photograph of a refinery.
   _Another British radio journalist visited downtown Tehran and
tried to compile a report of illegal, black market sales of hard
currency.
   _A Danish reporter tried to compile ``a negative report of the
economy.''

   The government said July 19 that reporters for
The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
would be barred from covering the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference.
   The three-day conference, which begins July 29, will discuss the
economic course of the Asia-Pacific region. Representatives of the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore
are attending.
   The government has been at odds with the Journal and the Review,
a weekly magazine, for several years over alleged interference in
the domestic politics of this island city-state. Both are published
in Hong Kong by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the United States.
   In a statement from New York, Dow Jones said that ``for reasons
that are unclear'' it appears Singapore ``is extending its
long-asserted right to restrict coverage of Singapore for
Singaporean readers (and) restrict coverage of international
economic meetings for all Asians.''
   In 1987, the government required the Journal to reduce its daily
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5,000. The Review was
ordered to cut its circulation to 400-500 copies a week from 10,000
but the magazine refused to continue selling in Singapore.
   Dow Jones said Singapore had given reporters for the U.S.-based
Wall Street Journal and AP-Dow Jones permission to attend the
conference. AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of The Associated Press
and Dow Jones.
   The action against the Asian Journal and the Economic Review
came a day after Singapore's government introduced a bill in
Parliament that would require foreign newspapers wishing to
circulate in Singapore to get permission annually.

   The World Press Freedom Committee is urging
all organizations hoping to foster a free press in Eastern Europe
to coordinate their efforts through a meeting in October.
   ``An entirely new dimension of needs and opportunities faces all
of us,'' Harold W. Andersen, chairman of the committee and former
publisher of the Omaha World-Herald, said July 17. ``We all need to
know what is being done _ and not being done.''
   He urged interested organizations to take part in a one-day
conference at the National Press Club in Washington on Oct. 10.
   The 14-year-old committee, which represents 33 national and
international news organizations from five continents, already has
surveyed the media of Eastern Europe and has prepared a list of
possible projects.
   It also has published a ``Handbook for Journalists of Central

organizations to match needs and resources.
   ``A substantial number of people and organizations, both public
and private, are trying to help,'' said Anderson. ``We need to
share information as to who is doing what. This should help all
parties avoid duplication and cooperate more freely.''
   He said the committee wanted participation from every
organization already helping East European media or even thinking

<HEAD>British Court Raps `Abuse of Power' in County's Murdoch Ad Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court ruled July 18 that a county
authority committed a ``flagrant abuse of power'' in withdrawing
its advertisements from a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch.
   The court said Derbyshire County Council's action was vindictive
and made a ``gross attempt to deceive the court'' about its reasons.
   The council claimed the ban on advertising in the Times
Educational Supplement was prompted by legitimate educational
reasons, but the two-judge panel ruled it was vengeance against the
Murdoch-owned Sunday Times for publishing articles criticizing
council leader David Bookbinder.
   Such decision-making could only have been prompted ``by bad
faith, or in a word, vindictiveness,'' said Judge Tasker Watkins.
   Quashing the ban as unlawful, he said it was a ``bad example of
local authority maladministration which is potentially, if not
actually, harmful to the interests of education in Derbyshire.''
   Local authorities control education in England and have budgets
to advertise for school staff.
   The council switched its advertising to the Guardian newspaper,
which charges higher rates and reaches a much smaller readership in
the education world than the Times Educational Supplement, the
court was told.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools should be declared
``commercial-free zones'' to protect children from the increasing
prevalence of advertising disguised as educational materials, a
consumer group says.
   Consumers Union said July 17 that many purported teaching aids
donated by businesses contain pitches for those businesses'
products. Some of the come-ons are direct, others surreptitious, it
said.
   Schools often acquiesce to the handouts because they can't
afford to buy unbiased new materials, the report said. Students
fall victim, because they are unlikely to question advertising
disguised as schoolwork, the group said.
   ``The result: Schools are becoming heavily sponsored by
corporations marketing products,'' the report said. ``They're
`selling' the kids entrusted to them to any bidder.''
   The study also criticized other forms of advertising aimed at
children, including ads in children's magazines that are disguised
as editorial copy, the use of celebrities to promote products, ads
camouflaged as entertainment, and licensing deals that put popular
symbols on a vast array of products.
   Interest in the issue of advertising in schools was heightened
last year by the advent of Channel One, a video news program for
pupils that includes commercials. Schools receive the program and
viewing equipment free.
   Consumers Union called Channel One ``the tip of the iceberg''
and listed examples of self-promotion in corporate-supplied
teaching materials. It said such materials reach more than 20
million students a year, although it did not estimate what
proportion include advertising.

   Spanish-language television stations excluded

   ``I just don't understand the reason. If they don't want to deal

   ``The irony of the thing is he was talking here about a

Univision network, Telemundo's competitor.
   Ms. Figueroa said she wouldn't call the action discrimination,

station was intentionally left out.
   Affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC were invited to interview Quayle

<HEAD>Station Reinstates Talk Show Host Who Banned Black Callers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radio talk show host who was suspended
for banning black callers returned to the air July 17 after his
station manager said his action was not malicious.
   Tim Lennox, who had been suspended on July 12, returned to his
afternoon talk show but was removed from his job as news director
and will be on probation for a year, said Berkley Fraser, manager
of WERC-AM.
   Lennox also will be required to develop, produce and serve as
host of a special series for the station on the topic ``Birmingham
faces the future,'' focusing on race relations in the city.
   Lennox said early in his two-hour talk show on July 11 that he
would take no calls from blacks that day because three station
employees had seen a black youth break into an fellow employee's
car and take her purse just before air time.
   Lennox said later that he made ``an emotional spur-of-the-moment
decision.'' He and Fraser issued on-air apologies the next day.
   Fraser said his investigation showed Lennox's action was ``not
based in malice and his 14-year career was without incidence of any
racial prejudice.''

<HEAD>Stations Asked To Prove Compliance With FCC Political Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FCC officials staged surprise inspections at
30 major market television and radio stations to check whether they
are offering political candidates the lowest possible advertising
rates.
   The FCC held its first-ever audits of broadcasters July 16-17,
prompted by what an agency news release called an ``obligation to
assure that broadcast stations are complying with political
programming laws and rules, especially in an election year.''
   The inspections, carried out in five cities, kicked off an
auditing process that is expected to be completed before the fall
congressional elections.
   The audits were not the result of any complaint, said Milton
Graves, chief of the FCC's political division.
   ``This is just a part of overseeing how the stations are
complying,'' he said. ``We want to know what their practices are.''
   The FCC sent field inspectors to stations in Cincinnati,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.
In each city, they visited four television stations, an AM radio
station and an FM radio station.
   Under FCC regulations, the lowest unit charge is available to
political candidates 45 days before primary balloting and six days
before a general election. Candidates may purchase single broadcast
advertisements for the same price as commercial advertisers who buy
a number of spots in the same time period.
   The subject of political advertising rates has been a sore spot
in Congress, where proposals are pending that would guarantee that
candidates get the lowest rates without fear of being preempted by
commercial advertisers who come in and offer to pay higher rates.
   The stations audited were:
   _Cincinnati: WCPO-TV, WKRC-TV, WLWL-TV, WIII-TV, WCKY-AM and
WWNK-FM in Cincinnati.
   _Dallas: KDFW-TV, KXAS-TV, WFAA-TV, KTXA-TV, KRLD-AM and KPLX-FM.
   _Philadelphia: KYW-TV, WCAU-TV, WPVI-TV, WGBS-TV, WPEN-AM and
WWDB-FM.
   _Portland: KATU-TV, KGW-TV, KOIN-TV, KPTV-TV, KWJJ-AM and

<HEAD>FCC Fines Indiana Station for Comedy Routines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have fined WFBQ-FM
$10,000 for broadcasting allegedly indecent comedy routines.
   The Federal Communications Commission sent a letter July 19 to
Great American Television and Radio Co. of Cincinnati, which owns
WFBQ, advising it of the fine.
   The FCC found that portions of five broadcasts of ``The Bob and
Tom Show'' aired between June 1987 and August 1989 ``contained lewd
and vulgar language dwelling on depictions or descriptions of
sexual organs and activities.''
   The station was fined the maximum $2,000 for each violation. The
station has 30 days to appeal or to pay the fine.
   Chris Wheat, station manager, said a decision would be made in a
few days on whether the ruling would be appealed.
   WFBQ had argued that the routines were at most ``indirect,
non-explicit, double-entendre humor about sexual matters.''
   However, the FCC ruled that ``the language used in each passage
was understandable and clearly capable of a specific sexual meaning
and, because of the context, the sexual import was inescapable.''
   In June, the FCC imposed a $20,000 fine against KSJO-FM of San
Jose, Calif., for indecent broadcasts.

   During the weeklong search, a deep-sea probe equipped with sonar
and a video camera will be dragged across a 24-square-mile area
about 100 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   If the door is spotted, another device will be used at a later

   The busiest month yet for the savings and loan
bailout ballooned the federal budget deficit to $11.2 billion in
June, a month when corporate tax payments usually produce a
surplus, the government said Monday.
   The shortfall, compared with a $7.8 billion surplus in June
1989, brought red ink for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to
$163.1 billion, more than half again as much as the $105.4 billion
deficit at this time last year.
   If the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace, it could
top the record fiscal-year deficit of $221.1 billion set in 1986.
The White House Office of Management and Budget is officially
forecasting a budget gap of $218.5 billion, just short of the
record.
   White House negotiators and congressional leaders are attempting

plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how NASA has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said Steve
Saunders, the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the $1.5 billion Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for Magellan.

   After three generations of uneasy coexistence
with the Communists in the Kremlin, the Moslems of Central Asia are
asserting themselves anew. This is the second installment of a
four-part series based on an AP special correspondent's journey
through the Soviet south.

   A stonework galaxy of crescent moons
has risen above the jagged outlines of tombs in the 1,000-year-old
Chigotai cemetery, symbolically ending the long Soviet eclipse of
Islam.
   ``Now Communist Party officials mourn their dead in the open
instead of performing Moslem rites secretly at home,'' the aged
guardian told visitors.
   From Ashkabad to Alma Ata, across a 1,200-mile sweep of the
Soviet Union, Central Asians are embracing Allah with the fervor of
long-lost prodigal sons.
   On Fridays, row after row of barefoot, bearded men in braided
skullcaps chant centuries-old litanies and bow not toward Moscow
but to Mecca.
   Koranic schools are filling with youngsters, and countless
mosques are reopening. ``I cannot even say how many,'' said
Mohammed Zakhir, deputy grand mufti of Central Asia. ``But a new
one opens every week. It is endless.''
   Religious leaders insist the new mood is joyous rather than
militant, a sign that tenacious faith has prevailed over an
ideology that used propaganda and sometimes brute force to try to
wipe it out.
   ``This is no revival of Islam because it was never dead,'' said
a Tashkent professor, who asked not to be quoted by name. ``We
always did in private what we can now do in public.''
   In fact, many Central Asians say, Islam is an important force in
the new political current carrying five of the Soviet Union's 15
republics further away from Moscow.
   At the rural level, power slipping away from local Communist
Party officials is shifting to imams, and in cities the party
curries favor with the clergy.
   An aggressive new attitude is evident in scattered outbreaks of
violence.
   In May, in the crowded Fergana Valley east of this old Uzbek
capital, witnesses said masked fundamentalist leaders led youths on
a rampage of burning and looting in an apparent play for power.
   Three months earlier and farther south, in Dushanbe, capital of
mountainous Tadzhikistan, Western visitors reported that Moslem
faithful went directly from praying to rioting _ and to demanding
the resignation of local officials.
   Tashkent and the populous republic of Uzbekistan are shared by
nearly 100 ethnic groups, with beliefs ranging from orthodox Islam
to Marxist atheism. In many areas, they compete intensely for land,
housing and jobs.
   Mostly, Islam is a conduit for new feelings of identity. For
Central Asians, it is as much a way of life as a religion, the
arbiter of family life, community traditions and spiritual values.
   From the first Russian incursions to the south, Islam was a
principal target, and many Soviet Moslems say they feel a
deep-seated prejudice against Russian people.
   After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Moscow condemned Islam as
divisive superstition and sought to eliminate it along with other
religions.
   Most mosques were closed and many were destroyed. During some
periods, Islam was banned outright. More often, it was vilified by
intense propaganda, and faithful Moslems had to choose between
Allah and advancement in a party-controlled society. No muezzins
wailed from minarets before prayer. Hardly a trickle of Soviet
Moslems made it to Mecca for the annual pilgrimage.
   ``These past oppressions are ending,'' said Usmonhon Alimov,
imam of the graceful al-Bukhari Mosque near Samarkand, among the
few Islamic holy sites to remain mostly unmolested since the 1920s.
   ``Young men are flocking to the faith, openly, and mosques are
being established in every village,'' he said.
   Today, 55 million Moslems, most of them in Central Asia, make up
a fifth of the national population, and every second child born in
the Soviet Union is a Moslem.
   A decade ago, during the height of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution in neighboring Iran, powerful Iranian radio
transmitters urged Moslem brothers to rise up against the Soviet
state. At the time, Moscow was at war in Afghanistan, deploying
some Central Asian soldiers against anti-communist Moslem
guerrillas.
   Today, although Moslem militancy seems to be growing, political
analysts see only limited outside meddling from across the Iranian
and Afghan borders. In Soviet Central Asia, fundamentalists are far
outnumbered by more moderate Moslems, and Shiites _ Khomeini's
branch of Islam _ by Sunni Moslems.
   But analysts say the potential for pan-Islamic militancy is a
serious cause for concern. Common values and even blood ties draw
together populations separated for 70 years by an impenetrable
border.
   Stanislav Prozorov, head of an Islamic studies group in the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, faults Soviet leaders for misreading
Moslems, ignoring them on one hand and overreacting on the other.
   Recently, he told the daily paper Komsomolets Uzbekistana he saw
a definite danger of an ``Islamic explosion'' because of
``Islamophobia'' on the part of Soviet leaders and thinkers.
   Frustrated Moslems might unite and respond with unpredictable
vehemence, he said. Had the Kremlin understood Islam in Soviet
Asia, it would never have invaded Afghanistan, he added.
   Western scholars agree. Michael Rywkin of City College of New
York has described growing masses that are ``practically
unassimilable and indifferent to most official Soviet values.''
   In March, Anatolii Luk'yanov, chairman of the Soviet national
Parliament, met with the grand mufti of Central Asia, Mukhammad
Sadik Mukhammad Yusuf, to discuss Islamic affairs.
   The 36-year-old mufti was named chairman of the Religious Board
of Moslems of Central Asia last year after widespread complaints
that his predecessor toadied to Moscow.
   In the meeting, he assured Soviet leaders he supported
perestroika and was trying to help free captured Soviet soldiers in
Afghanistan.
   But in April, on Moscow television, he sharply criticized the
Kremlin for interfering in Islamic affairs and not giving Moslem
leaders the same access to the media as the Russian Orthodox
hierarchy.
   He said that because of ignorance of Islam, official policy
tried to restrict the religion rather than take advantage of its
ability to inspire social change and ethnic harmony.
   Episodes of zealotry should not raise fears that the fading
Soviet states will give way to harsh new Islamic regimes, Central
Asian leaders say.
   Imam Alimov blamed fanatics for trampling women's rights,
abusing non-Moslem settlers and frightening people whose ideas of
Islam were colored by fundamentalist excesses elsewhere.
   ``These things are holdovers from the past, the result of
oppression,'' he said. ``People are learning again about Islam.
Young men are studying the Koran. These things will change.''

   Each year about 4 million babies are born in the
United States, about 200,000 of them with serious defects. In the
past decade, however, pediatric surgeons working with sophisticated
and tiny instruments have been able to make remarkable repairs to
newborn babies. Now they are even going inside the fetus, opening a
new medical frontier.

<TEXT>
   The fetus, that incredible assembly of cells following its own
blueprint toward human life, was once a citadel as daunting to
doctors as the human brain. Not anymore.
   The surgeon's knife is entering the womb to correct errors of
nature in the fetus only 23 weeks into pregnancy, a 1-pound
humanoid with arms the size of your little finger, a heart the size
of a walnut, and tiny lungs that would fit inside the skin of an
orange.
   These dramatic techniques _ and some to come that are even more
dramatic _are used to rescue a very few fetuses, just as heart
repair and transplants are used for very few newborns.
   Not everyone agrees that fetal surgeries are appropriate or even
necessary. Rarely, some doctors say, are they so critical that they
can't be postponed until after birth with the same results.
   But they offer a window to the future, a future that is not very
far off.
   And they reflect the advances in pediatric surgery over the last
decade, a decade that has seen newborn heart transplants become
almost commonplace, with doctors reaching into tiny chests to do
all kinds of shunts and plumbing repairs, restructuring valves,
replacing what nature forgot.
   Of the 4 million or so live births each year in the United
States, about 200,000 infants have serious defects and about 40,000
of those die. There is a lot of work to do.
   Researchers are working now on ways to implant cells or genes
into 12-week-old fetuses whose functions are limited because of the
lack of even a single enzyme or protein; their cells are missing a
vital blueprint to make those chemicals and ensure normal growth.
   But for the time being, at least, fetal surgery remains
anatomical, the fixing of structures gone awry.
   The most recent instance: A surgeon in San Francisco opens the
womb, makes a 2-inch incision in the chest wall of the fetus below
the ribs on the left side.
   He finds what the sound-pictures told him he would: The
diaphragm that separates the chest and abdominal cavities has not
grown properly, a disorder that occurs once in only 2,000
pregnancies.
   The organs and intestines from the lower cavity are crushing the
developing left lung. He delicately rearranges things, patches the
diaphragm to hold everything in the right place, and departs the
sanctity of the womb to let the pregnancy progress.
   His patient, the mother, delivers a normal baby.
   But in six attempts at this kind of surgery, only two fetuses
have survived.
   What astonishes the doctors is ``these fetuses heal without a
scar,'' says the surgeon, Dr. Michael R. Harrison of the University
of California, San Francisco.
   Now he and his colleagues are trying to find out why. Is it
something the youthful cells produce that allows that kind of
healing, and what would that mean to the adult world that is not so
equipped?
   At the very least, Harrison says, it suggests it might be a good
idea to correct some serious defects to the fetus before birth ``to
take advantage of this scarless healing.''
   He emphasizes how few are the candidates for any of these new
advances in pediatiatric and fetal surgery.
   What makes much of it possible is the diagnosis of many ailments
shortly after gestation.
   In the 1970s, Chinese and Soviet scientists discovered that they
could look into the future of the fetus by studying the chorionic
villi, the primordial placental cells, the gestational bed in the
uterus. They used a needle to enter the uterus very early in
pregnancy and using suction they removed some of the villi for
study. This is chorionic villi sampling or CVS, developed as an
alternative for amniocentesis, which is an analysis of the fluid in
the womb, which cannot be done as early.
   Concurrent with the refinement of this work was the use of
ultrasound to actually picture the fetus in the womb, enabling
doctors to see what they were doing.
   ``I guess the basic idea is that we can do bone marrow
transplants a whole lot better before birth,'' Harrison says.
   But what of the rejection problem?
   Working with sheep and monkeys, Harrison says, ``amazingly the
rejection was circumvented if you took stem cells, the
blood-forming cells from the liver at a time when the liver acts as
the bone marrow.''
   ``We're using fetal cells that won't recognize they are not at
home. ... It seemed like a fantastic script, and it is.''
   ``The alternative strategy is, rather than transplanting the
whole cell, why not transplant the gene?'' Harrison says. ``The
gene folks are getting so clever that they are pretty close to
being able to do that.''
   Rejection is still the major problem in newborn heart
transplants, and so they are not considered a cure for a bad heart
in the traditional sense of the word ``cure.'' They are only a
treatment, and patients with transplanted hearts must continue to
take anti-rejection medicine for the rest of their lives.
   Which is why a heart transplant is a last-ditch method. Surgeons
try first to repair the heart, its malformed valves, its missing
chambers, its badly arranged plumbing.
   The heart of a newborn is about the size of a plum, yet surgery
is possible shortly after birth, if not always practical.
   ``A heart transplant is an open-heart procedure and it is
technically sometimes much less demanding than some of the repairs
that we are doing,'' says Dr. Jan M. Quaegebeur who has recently
come to New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Babies Hospital from the
Netherlands.
   ``We know that babies are strong enough to go through the
operations. The question is whether you have to do a transplant.
The reason you would do a transplant is because you have doubts you
could do a good repair.''
   The human heart is in essence a pumping machine, the right side
of which pumps blood to the lungs to be oxygenated while the left
side sends the freshened blood coursing through the body again,
taking oxygen to distant tissues and picking up carbon dioxide for
exhalation from the lungs.

   When a baby is born with an underdeveloped left or right
ventricle, the main pumping chambers of the heart, it basically has
a single-chamber heart.
   It was just such a maldevelopment that led to the first infant
heart transplants.
   Two early attempts dating back to one in 1967 were failures.
Then in 1984, Dr. Leonard Bailey of Loma Linda University Medical
Center near Los Angeles transplanted a baboon heart into a
12-day-old infant known only as Baby Fae.
   Baby Fae survived only 20 days. The cross-species transplant was
more a reflection of the lack of human donors than anything else.
Baby Fae would have surely died if nothing were done. Desperation
is sometimes the mother of progress.
   Thirteen months later Bailey transplanted a human infant heart
into the breast of a 14 day old, code-named Baby Moses, who was
discharged a month and a half later in 1986. That transplant took,
and the heart grew with its recipient, Eddie Anguiano, who will be
5 years old in November.
   Since then Bailey has done some two-thirds of the nearly 70
infant heart transplants performed at Loma Linda, 53 of which
survive.
   To this day, not everyone agrees heart transplants are the
answer. There may be other repairs that would do as well.
   ``You can't make a four-chamber heart out of a two-chamber heart
or a three-chamber heart,'' says Dr. Welton Gersony of
Columbia-Presbyterian's Babies Hospital. ``The structures are just
missing. But we have found great success with a total bypass of the
missing right heart, allowing the blood to flow from the veins
directly into the lungs.
   ``That's an exciting area. We've shown you can live without a
chamber on the right side.''
   In short, surgeons have made considerable progress on infant
heart repair since doctors in England showed how to inflate a tiny
balloon in infant heart valves to force them to enlarge.
   ``If we look at the scope of operations that have been performed
on different kinds of abnormalities, we can do good operations with
low mortality in the first year of life, mortalities of two or
three percent,'' Quaegebeur says. ``Now there are diseases which
are so severe that we don't have a good anatomical correction.''
   It is conceivable that something might be done in the fetal
stage in those cases, he says.
   ``In the last decade a group of surgeons dedicated to repairing
as completely as possible and as early as possible virtually every
defect have come to the fore,'' Gersony says. Not all are of equal
proficiency, although many try.
   ``Essentially what we have is earlier and earlier repair and
there's a logic to it: to make the heart normal as early as
possible.''
   Harrison and his fellow fetal surgeons think ``as early as
possible'' means in the womb.
   Besides correcting the herniated diaphragms, he has entered the
uterus to fix blocked bladders so the fetus can urinate. This is
important to prevent damage to the kidney and the lungs.
   ``It took us many years to find out. But the simple answer is
most of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is made up of
fetal urine. If the block won't let the kid pee, then the fluid
goes away, the uterus collapses on the kid and that affects his
lung growth.''
   He is also working on animals to see if it is practical to
unblock the ducts in the brain that allow spinal fluid to vent.
When blocked, the spinal fluid backs up and produces the enlarged
heads of hydrocephalus.
   ``A couple of very interesting things that will be done, have
been done, involve tumors,'' Harrison says. ``One is a benign
growth in the lung. It gets so big it impairs lung development. We
don't talk about things until they are published, but it is ready.''
   Along the same lines is a teratoma, a growth that emerges on the
fetus' back and sometimes becomes as large as the fetus itself. It
kills by stealing the fetus' blood. Harrison says it needs to be
removed in the uterus.
   There is also the case of the slow heart, apparently because of
an electrical block in the heart muscle.
   ``The kid is perfectly normal in every other way except the
heart beats so slowly, about 45 beats a minute, that the kid dies.
Now the solution to that would be to implant a pacemaker in the
fetus.''
   Harrison tends to view the developing of a child as a continuum.
But the medical profession is reluctant to go that far in treating
its patients. There are certain ethical problems that go to the
life of the mother.
   The origin of 95 percent of the maldevelopment at birth is
happenstance, as opposed to inherited genetic problems.
   In the complex process that begins with simple cell division,
then to differentiation, nature makes rare mistakes, a miracle in
itself.
   Of all the things that go wrong, the heart is the most
correctable. The toughest part of heart transplantation is the
availability of hearts.
   If surgeons differ on when and how, they do not differ much on
their personal involvement or their dedication or their
vulnerability.
   For Quaegebeur, the expert in newborn surgery: ``I am better at
it now than I was a few years ago. I still have problems when I
have to go back and speak to the parents. Bringing good news is
easy and even then you can't become involved emotionally. ... It's
more difficult, naturally, when you have to bring bad news. It
still troubles me. I am not emotionally detached.
   ``When I'm doing the surgery, it is a different matter. You are
in this heart and with that surgical team. You are not with the
family. You are trying to get everything done and that means you
have to remain professional.''
   For fetal surgeon Harrison: ``We don't give up. We work as hard
as we can until we succeed. Or the fetus dies.''

   When Susan Cox was pregnant with her second
child, she had a suspicion that something was wrong.
   Call it maternal instinct.
   The doctors did constant tests ``to reassure me that everything
was fine,'' she says, ``but I just couldn't believe it.''
   The 30-year-old woman so reveres life that she named her
daughter Zoe and planned to name a son Vidal, words derived from
``life'' in other languages.
   When the baby was born the doctors told her he was just fine,
``except that he was just cold and a little blue.''
   Ingy, as the boy came to be called after his middle name,
Ingmar, was in intensive care hours after he was born in
Morristown, N.J. He was transferred to Columbia-Presbysterian
Babies Hospital in New York City the next day.
   His case demonstrates the uneven road of pediatric heart
surgery, and some of the pitfalls along the way.
   Ingy is 3{ years old now, a lively, bright bundle of energy who
has had four brushes with death.
   At Babies Hospital a more complete examination of his heart
showed it had inverted ventricles, the pumping chambers, with no
connection to the pulmonary artery that carries blood to the lungs.
In addition, there was a wide hole between the reversed ventricles.
   It was ``one screwed-up heart,'' as one hospital staffer put it.
   The first surgery came when Ingy was 4 days old. A shunt was
installed from one pumping chamber to the pulmonary artery. A block
developed and 10 days later the infant was operated on again and a
new shunt was installed.
   For three years Ingy seemed to be living a normal, active life.
But then he began turning blue again. A third operation showed he
had outgrown the shunt. It was replaced and the hole between the
two pumping chambers was fixed. It was as close as surgeons could
come to a complete repair, considering what they started with.
   There were ups and downs in the ensuing months after the family
moved to Princeton, N.J. Ingy developed respiratory problems and
then heart failure that miraculously reversed itself. The doctors
ascribed the heart failure to a virus and postponed any further
work until after December.
   ``God gave us Christmas,'' Mrs. Cox says. ``We had a wonderful
Christmas.''
   Then Ingy developed pneumonia. This time the surgeons decided
that no further repair was possible. The only alternative was a
heart transplant.
   At Babies Hospital it is Dr. Daphne Hsu's job to find a heart
and type it to see if it is immunologically compatible with a
potential recipient.
   ``We get our donors from the same kind of tragedies as those
that supply our adult patients _ accidents, neurological ailments,
even tumors,'' she says. ``We'll take hearts from donors who have
problems that don't involve the heart because our donor supply is
so limited.''
   The only supply of hearts for newborns are the hearts of other
newborns. The heart has to be about the same size as that of the
child who will receive it, besides being immunologically compatible.
   And there is urgency. A heart will keep only four hours after it
is removed. Kidneys can be kept viable longer. But a heart has to
be rushed to an airport, flown to where the sick recipient is and
sped to the bedside.
   They found a heart for Ingy on Valentine's Day this year.
   ``We were very lucky to get a heart within a week,'' Susan Cox
says. Most kids have to wait weeks, even months, getting sicker all
the time.
   ``This is not a cure,'' she says. ``It's a treatment. That's one
thing that really has to be emphasized.''
   For the rest of his life Ingy will have to take the drugs that
suppress his immune system and ensure that he will keep his heart.
   ``We lost a couple of teen-agers who were feeling so good they
didn't think of themselves as sick anymore and quit taking their
medicine,'' says Hsu.

   He was a crusader for liberal causes forced to
make a painful decision. If he wanted to remain a priest, Robert F.
Drinan had to give up politics. Now he's found other forums to get
his views across, beginning in a classroom at Georgetown
University. Here's another article in an occasional series called
Class Act.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A decade ago, Jesuit priest Robert F. Drinan
was ordered by Pope John Paul II to choose between the priesthood
and his seat in Congress.
   The clerical collar he still wears speaks of his choice.
   In his office at Georgetown University Law Center, Drinan pulls
out a thick volume of church law and reads aloud: ``No priest or
nun may hold any office ...''
   ``They changed canon law after my case,'' he says. ``Now it's
very clear. They legitimized their preference. It's all spelled out
with long footnotes about Drinan.''
   And then he sums it up, sums it up with a bit more bite.
   ``The pope threw me out,'' says Drinan, known for his espousal
of liberal causes as a member of the House of Representatives from
Massachusetts.
   On May 5, 1980, Drinan accepted the pope's order ``with regret
and pain.''
   But neither pain nor regret seem evident in his chosen role as
Drinan the priest. Nor is it surprising that he chose a ministry in
the classic Jesuit mold, the priesthood of the intellect.
   His forum is a classroom, his subject one that confronts
conflicts, challenges certitudes and stirs the Jesuitical juices:
legal ethics.
   It is 7 p.m. as Drinan surveys his class gathered in seven rows
of desks before him in a large room walled with concrete blocks
painted blue. Four large television sets are suspended from the
ceiling but they are silent and Drinan speaks without competition.
   Legal ethics?
   ``Anyone who says that legal ethics is an oxymoron, a
contradiction in terms, will have to leave the room,'' Drinan had
joked earlier.
   But now he's asking questions.
   ``Does a lawyer have an obligation to report on his fellow
lawyers when he sees something wrong?''
   He tells of a lawyer in Chicago who was suspended for a year,
caught between the competing demands of the attorney-client
privilege and the obligation to report another lawyer's wrongdoing.
   ``Was there an injustice?'' Drinan asks his students. ``Should
he have gone to jail, had his finger cut off, or what?''
   Drinan moves out from behind the lectern, paces, hands shoved
deep in his pockets, continuing the lecture in a strong, raspy
voice.
   ``There's a lawyer in New York who represents the bad lawyers.
He seems to enjoy this line of work. Maybe you'll get into legal
ethics as a career after this midsummer night's dream?
   ``No?''
   Drinan scrawls case citations and legal rules on a blackboard,
then selects a book from a desk covered with books in staggered
piles. He licks his thumb and turns a page.
   ``We now come to a very juicy subject. Should you turn in your
brother and sister lawyers?''
   Drinan interlocks his fingers, pulls them apart, laces them back
together.
   ``What to do? It's not black and white. That's the nature of
it.''
   Drinan's fingers splay up, framing his balding head.
   ``Would you require every lawyer to have malpractice insurance?
There would be a whole new wave of litigation. It would bring up
more problems than it would solve.''
   Drinan's hands interlock on his chest.
   ``Confidentiality,'' he says. ``This is the biggie. This is
going to haunt you all of your life. Lawyer-client privilege.
   ``It's based on the theory that somewhere in society there must
be secrecy, that someone needs a father confessor.
   ``We've had it for 400 or 500 years and for 400 or 500 years
lots of people have been banging on the desk and saying, `Why do
these clowns have this?''' Drinan bangs on his desk.
   The 90-minute class breaks up for the evening.
   ``Most of his students are repeats,'' one of them says, leaving
the room. ``He has a real strong following here.''
   Drinan has never been one to avoid controversy and has never
lacked for a following.

   He ticked off a list of activities that drew attention in the
Vatican: his opposition to the war in Vietnam, his opposition to
the military draft, his leadership in the abolition of mandatory
retirement, his work from within to abolish the House Internal
Security Committee, formerly the House Un-American Activities
Committee.
   He listed his work for human rights, his campaign to liberate
imprisoned Soviet human rights activist Anatoly Sharansky, his
involvement in improving U.S. law involving civil liberties, crime,
copyright and bankruptcy.
   ``I am grateful to have had these opportunities as a moral
architect,'' Drinan says. ``I can think of no opportunities more
worthy of the involvement of a priest and a Jesuit.''
   When Drinan gave up his vote as a representative of
Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District he did not give up his
voice or abandon his liberal causes. For two years after his
departure from Congress he served as president of Americans for
Democratic Action, one of the nation's most outspokenly liberal
political organizations.
   Now he not only teaches but also writes and lectures.
   Drinan's interest in the ethical conduct of the legal profession
led to the founding three years ago of the Georgetown Journal of
Legal Ethics, a publication that has won praise as an important
source of scholarly ideas and information on issues facing lawyers
and judges.
   A recent issue includes articles on legal malpractice, lawyer
advertising, the issue of whether elected judges should disqualify
themselves in cases involving campaign contributors.
   Drinan, who serves as the journal's faculty adviser, says,
``There has been a renaissance of legal ethics in America and this
is the bible.''
   But there is more to the Drinan agenda, much of it stemming from
issues he pursued in his decade as a congressman _ human rights,
civil rights, arms control.
   Since leaving Congress, Drinan has written three books, bringing
his total since 1963 to seven. The latest: ``Cry of the Oppressed _
The History and Hope of the Human Rights Revolution.''
   Drinan takes credit for persuading the American Bar Association
to endorse the Civil Rights Act of 1990. He soon will become
chairman of the group's committee on individual rights.
   His work has not gone unnoticed.
   Drinan now holds 20 honorary degrees, 11 of them awarded since
he left Congress.
   What does he miss about Congress?
   ``I still use the swimming pool,'' he says, then laughs and
adds: ``The taxpayers pay for the towels.
   ``I guess the thing I miss most is the parking perks at the
airport.''
   But there was more to Drinan's congressional career than that.
   He was in the thick of the battle to end to the war in Vietnam,
the issue on which he was first elected.
   ``Mr. Speaker, I urge all of these people to make war on war,''
Drinan said during a 1971 speech.
   Drinan's congressional papers _ 520 linear feet of them _ are
now housed in the archive of Boston College. Drinan was law
professor and dean of the Boston College Law School from 1956 to
1970.
   The papers contain the first impeachment resolution ever filed
against former President Nixon. It had nothing to do with Watergate
but rather with Nixon's ordering the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.
   The archive also records Drinan's participation in the
impeachment inquiry conducted later by the House Judiciary
Committee.
   Drinan, again pulling books and pamphlets off his shelves, says,
``Here are some more of my babblings.''
   There is a reprint of an opinion piece in the Boston Herald
condemning the U.S. invasion of Panama as a violation of
international law; an article in the National Catholic Reporter
questioning lotteries and suggesting that gambling can weaken the
strength of individuals and the nation; an article examining ``the
political earthquakes in Eastern Europe.''
   Drinan grins.
   ``Helps me stay off the streets,'' he says.

   He was called a ``political prodigy,'' an
eloquent spokesman for the young Israeli nation. Now he feels the
Jewish state he so strongly defended has taken a wrong turn. But
Abba Eban at 75 has no real political power now and he vents his
frustrations mainly through the media.

<TEXT>
   The cultured Cambridge-accented wit and oratory
of Abba Eban once was the voice of Israel, extolling the young
nation's virtues before the world and defending it from attack by
its enemies.
   The voice has been muted for some time now and when Eban, at 75,
does speak up he is more likely to admonish than praise the Israel
that has grown up in the past 42 years.
   The tall, stately former ambassador and politician is saddened
by what he sees as a besmirched image of Israel stemming from the
incessant conflict with the Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   ``I think there is a sense of a paradise lost,'' he says.
``There is a kind of broken heart especially among Jews about the
image Israel once projected and the image it presents now.''
   Still, Eban keeps his fervor for the Jewish state. In articles,
lectures and television appearances, the retired diplomat urges a
return to the Israel of his youth, even as he damns the Israel of
his advanced years.
   He is frustrated by Israel's political turn to the right,
sharpened in the past 2{ years by the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He criticizes both the right-wing government of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and his own left-of-center Labor Party, which exiled
him from politics in 1988 by refusing him a nomination to run for
Parliament.
   He strongly objects to Israel's refusal to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization or to consider trading occupied
land for peace, a policy the United States advocates for solving
the Middle East conflict.
   Israel ``is really tearing up its own birth certificate'' by
refusing to share land and offer political rights to the
Palestinians, Eban said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Eban spoke by telephone from New York City. These days he spends
much of his time abroad on projects that stress Israel's legacy of
humanity and enlightenment.
   ``There is salvation and significance for the Jew only when he
stands straight and aims high within his own authentic frame of
values,'' Eban wrote in his book ``Heritage,'' which was made into
a series for American public television.
   ``The Hebrew Messianic idea is alive with a sense of hope and
purpose,'' he wrote. ``It is worthwhile to strive for human
perfection, for social progress ... for universal peace.''
   Dazzling words for Israel's Jewish ideals _ accompanied by
doubts over the government's political actions _ were a theme of
Eban's career.
   The South African-born Eban was always more dovish than Israel's
other leaders on the Arab-Israeli conflict. In four decades as
Israel's U.N. and U.S. ambassador, foreign minister and leading
member of Parliament, Eban often objected privately to policies he
supported publicly.
   In 1956, he argued bitterly with Israel's first prime minister,
David Ben-Gurion, over Israel's hesitation to withdraw from
Egyptian Sinai after the 1956 Suez War. But he then went before the
United Nations and eloquently defended Israel.
   It is said Ben-Gurion later joked to Eban that it wasn't until
he heard the U.N. speech ``that I became convinced of why we
shouldn't withdraw.''
   Today, with no real leadership role, Eban is more publicly
critical.
   Israeli newspapers once called Eban ``a political prodigy'' for
his youthful success in diplomacy. He was only 33 when he became
Israel's first U.N. ambassador, at the time the youngest head of
mission at the world body.
   In 1950, when Eban was 35, he was appointed ambassador to
Washington, Israel's most important diplomatic post. He was 48 when
he was named deputy prime minister and 51 when he got his most
prestigious post, foreign minister.
   Now he has dropped into political oblivion.
   Eban said on Israel radio recently that he is keeping ``a
certain distance'' from politics. In the past, he has acknowledged
that his popularity overseas was not always matched at home.
   ``I could have been elected prime minister if people abroad
could vote in Israeli elections,'' he once jokingly told an AP
reporter.
   Eban's home is in Herzliya, a wealthy Tel Aviv suburb named for
Theodore Herzl, who conceived of the Jewish state. Eban and his
wife of 46 years, Susan, have two grown children, a daughter and a
son who is a clarinetist with the Tel Aviv Philharmonic.
   Last February, Eban's 75th birthday went virtually unnoticed in
Israel. At the United Nations, a gala party was thrown. Sponsors
included four former U.S. presidents, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford,
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
   Eban's polished British manners and wan complexion from his many
days in the corridors of power never fit in with Israel's culture
of tanned, rough-hewn, native-born ``sabras.'' Eban settled in
Israel after World War II, having served as a British liaison
officer at Allied headquarters in Jerusalem.

   His detractors accuse him of being snobbish about his British
upbringing and education. At Queens' College, Cambridge, he won
first-class honors in the classics, Hebrew, Arabic and Persian.
   Though he is conversant in 10 languages, Eban has been
criticized at home for his formal Hebrew.
   Isser Harel, former head of the Mossad intelligence agency, said
Eban ``always spoke such a literary Hebrew, rather than the popular
spoken tongue. It never sunk in very well.''
   In the early 1960s, Eban as education minister used an
antiquated phrase for ``youth'' while addressing a group of high
school students. One bewildered teen-ager thought Eban was making a
derogatory remark and shouted at him in protest.
   Eban at first was disappointed by his fall from political power.
Now he says he is happier with a television career in which he
reaches millions of people.
   ``It is a unique opportunity to try to correct the image of the
present by bringing the illumination of the past,'' Eban says.
   In lectures, newspaper columns and interviews, Eban relishes his
freedom from diplomatic strictures and speaks out sharply against
Israeli policies toward the Arabs and the United States.
   He feels Israel has forsaken the stance of compromise and moral
rectitude that was the key to world support for the Jewish state.
   A main target is Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, which objects
to relinquishing any of the West Bank and Gaza. It claims the lands
captured in the 1967 Middle East war _ home to 1.7 million
Palestinians _ are integral parts of the historic land of Israel.
   Eban notes Israel won world recognition in 1948 only after its
leaders agreed to partition historic Palestine, sharing the land
with the Arabs.
   ``As a central witness in the drama, I can say that if we had
claimed that 100 percent of the territory was ours then ... the
world would have successfully organized to prevent our emergence,''
he says.
   ``So today when the government claims 100 percent of the right,
it is really tearing up its own birth certificate. Israel's birth
is intrinsically and intimately linked with the idea of sharing
territory and sovereignty.''
   He also denounces Israel's refusal to involve the PLO in Middle
East peace moves, which has been a stumbling block to starting
U.S.-mediated negotiations.
   ``Our policy was always to speak to the adversary,'' Eban says.
   Eban complains, too, that his own Labor Party has failed to
persuade the Israeli public of the wisdom of a more conciliatory
stance.
   Despite his worries about present-day Israel, Eban does not
despair when he views the Jewish state within the sweep of history
and Jewish destiny.
   At one moment Eban talks about the blow to Israel's image from
the suppression of the Intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising. But then
he quickly recalls that in 1948 the survivors of the Nazi Holocaust
founded a new nation.
   ``The Intefadeh,'' he says, ``is only an episode in a long
story.''

   With some 41 million more foreigners expected to
visit America this year, it's important for the business executive
to know how to entertain them. That can be complicated, depending
on where they're from. Here's a guide to help you avoid cultural
gaffes, such as inadvertently inviting your guests to commit
hara-kiri.

   Look who's coming to dinner. The big
overseas client.
   It's decision-making time. Do you:
   _ Lock the dog in the basement?
   _ Order a dozen long-stemmed red roses?
   _ Search through the gourmet shops for sheeps' eyeballs, sea
slugs and fresh-frozen bear paws?
   _ Greet the overseas visitor with a slap on the back, a firm
handshake, perhaps three kisses on the cheek, or will just two
suffice?
   _ See if the library has a recipe for stir-fried bees?
   _ Dare do anything about s-e-x? After all, in many parts of the
world, sex is regarded as a hospitable gesture, a normal part of a
business deal.
   The outcome of your entire negotiations may depend on how you
cope with a cross-cultural crisis, warns Roger Axtell, a consultant
and lecturer on worldwide business protocol.
   After all, trying to seduce a female client or a visiting wife
is hardly getting things off to a crisp start, which, as Axtell
points out, is what a dozen red roses connotes to a guest from West
Germany.
   Besides, a bouquet of even-numbered flowers is considered bad
luck in her country, where etiquette further dictates that you
remove the paper first.
   Make sure the paper is not white if the guest is Japanese or the
flowers purple if the recipient is from Brazil or Mexico. These are
the colors of death in those climes. Also, white chrysanthemums in
much of Europe and flowers of any kind in Kenya convey condolences.
   Further regarding gifts, Axtell recalls the curious case of a
Grand Rapids, Mich., furniture dealer who didn't know the foreign
territory. Playing host at a dinner for buyers from Japan, he put a
silver pocket knife as a gift at each place setting. His guests
left the gifts behind, in silent dismay at what to them was an
invitation to commit hara-kiri.
   Axtell spent 30 years as vice president of world marketing for
Parker Pen Co., traveling in 80 countries, observing, and sometimes
inadvertently committing some of the cultural gaffes that can
result in an abrupt jagged line on the sales chart and the boss's
cardiogram.
   Now a roving consultant on global business behavior, Axtell has
just finished his third book, ``The Do's and Taboos of Hosting
International Visitors.''
   Citing Department of Commerce figures, Axtell notes that some 41
million international visitors will come to the United States this
year and spend $50 billion just for travel, food and accommodations.
   ``For the first time, there are more tourists arriving than
departing. A $1.5 billion balance of tourist trade is projected, so
it's important that we welcome them by recognizing the differences
in their cultures, their way of having fun and doing business.''
   Axtell warns that a host ``only invites disaster by attempting
to duplicate any exotic foreign cuisine. Better to serve a
typically American meal, with due regard for religious dietary
regulations. But spare the corn on the cob. It's considered cattle
food in many countries.''
   Axtell urges a quick course in international body language as a
basic survival tool in the global market place. Even a simple yes
or no gesture can mean the opposite in other cultures.

   When a visitor from Bulgaria or Sri Lanka nods his head, that
means no. A head shake connotes yes. A Turk signifies no by
``raising his chin, shutting his eyes and tilting the head
backward.''
   Ordinary gestures can convey extraordinary meanings to a foreign
visitor, advises Axtell. ``Placing your hands on your hips is an
aggressive gesture to a Mexican. Forming a circle with the thumb
and forefinger while elevating the other three fingers is a most
obscene gesture in Brazil.''
   Similarly, thumbs up is a rude gesture in Bangladesh, as is
winking or beckoning with the middle finger in Hong Kong and
Malaysia.
   ``The Japanese,'' he went on, ``dislike being pounded on the
back. Touching is unacceptable. To them an open mouth is offensive.
So yawns, belly laughs and chewing gum are out.''
   At table, the differences can be perplexing. A Swede
crisscrossing the utensils on his plate is asking for another
helping and not signifying he is full. Among Egyptians it is
impolite to eat everything on the plate. In Finland, it is bad luck
to pass the salt hand to hand. The shaker should be set down before
the guest. A Japanese will accept a second helping only if asked
twice. Zambians compliment the hostess by asking for seconds.
   Axtell regrets that ``toasting is a skill most Americans never
hone. But at a dinner or banquet, in less than a minute, a
well-composed toast can convey more elan and diplomacy than a month
of slick talk.''
   Unless you are an accomplished linguist, Axtell warns against
attempting a toast in the visitor's language. He once tried
memorizing the Chinese words for, ``Thank you for a wonderful
dinner. I ate so much I must loosen my belt.'' Later, he learned
what he actually said was, ``I ate so much the girth of my donkey's
saddle is loose.''
   But his embarrassment was less than that of an Iranian deputy
oil minister who hoisted a glass at the Petroleum Club in Houston
with the toast, ``As they say in your country: Up your bottoms.''
   But as Jimmy Carter found out on his 1977 trip to Poland, using
an interpreter can sometimes double the trouble.
   His interpreter made the arrival speech unforgettable even today
in Warsaw with the translation: ``The president says he is pleased
to be here in Poland grasping your secret parts.''
   Finally, there is the question of s-e-x. While hosting a foreign
client, is one obliged to arrange for some group interaction in a
hot tub, an all-purpose escort service or a visit to a local
pleasure palace?
   ``While in other countries sex often is an expected part of
business entertainment,'' Axtell answers, ``not once in over 30
years of hosting scores of business visitors from all over the
world did one of them request or show any expectation for a hired
sexual partner.''

   Prowling the streets at night, tailing suspects,
bringing the villains to justice is a new type of private eye. They
are women, just as savvy and cynical as Sam Spade or Phillip Marlow
and the rest of the macho male bunch that for so long dominated the
whodunit genre.

   Sue Grafton recalls scheming in the night about
a way to kill one of her two ex-husbands. After she'd carefully
worked it out, she realized, ``I knew I could never pull it off. I
thought, `I'll just put it in a book.'''
   Grafton didn't want to write a psychological novel in which the
reader identifies with a killer. So she created somebody to foil
her own plot. ``I gave the reader somebody virtuous to identify
with, the wisest move I ever made in my life.''
   Thus was born Kinsey Millhone, one of a new breed of
professional private investigators who have emerged in the long
evolution of the ``whodunit,'' women to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
with Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler's Phillip
Marlow and Ross MacDonald's Lou Archer.
   There have always been female detectives in modern literature,
such as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. But they have been almost
without exception genteel amateurs. The new ones, on the other
hand, are professionals.
   Six months before Kinsey Millhone's first appearance, in ``A Is
for Alibi,'' private eye V.I. (Victoria) Warshawski had solved her
first case in Sara Paretsky's ``Indemnity Only.''
   Paretsky, who wrote it in 1979, says that too often in American
crime novels sexually active unmarried women are the villains. ``In
six of seven Chandler novels, a sexually active woman is the main
villain. I really wanted to try to counteract that image,'' she
says.
   Paretsky was working full time as a manager at an insurance
company when she started working on the novel.
   ``Women were making it into the ranks of management,'' she says.
``There were people who pushed us as hard as they could to see if
we'd crack. I wanted a woman who was experiencing what I and my
friends were _ being challenged on her right to do the job. She was
a pioneer, being called an aggressive bitch.''
   A third private investigator, Carlotta Carlyle, was born after
her creator, Linda Barnes, had written four books about amateur
sleuth Michael Spraggue.
   ``I'd always wanted to write a woman P.I.,'' Barnes says. ``As
soon as I finished the first Spraggue in 1981, I talked to my
editor about doing a woman. He told me there's no market for
hard-boiled women. Since I don't write for posthumous glory, I
figured I would continue with Spraggue.
   ``I thought how nice it would be if people would knock on a
detective's door with problems. It's very hard to get amateurs
realistically involved in mysteries. I killed off all Spraggue's
friends and relatives. He was getting very depressed.''
   Each of these female private eyes is divorced; each of the
writers is married. All three write in the first person. The point
of view, mind and personality the reader gets to know is the
private detective's and, to some extent, the writer's.
   Paretsky, who was born in Iowa and grew up in Nebraska, lives in
Chicago. Her husband calls her a pit bull. She has had V.I. tangle
with corruption in Chicago politics, Great Lakes shipping,
malpractice, the Roman Catholic Church and Vatican Bank.
   ``I find it very disturbing the way in which people in large
institutions can commit tremendous amounts of crime, violating
public trust. The damage that can do runs very deep in individual
lives,'' she says. ``Three or four times a week I make these moral
decisions. Am I brave enough to write about this issue, to stand up
to this person? Three times out of five I chicken out.
   ``Every day I try to make myself take on the things I'm afraid
of. V.I. can do it in a way that I can't. I suppose it is that kind
of integrity and passion that matter most to me.''
   In contrast to Paretsky's big issues, Grafton says, ``My stories
come out of an instance in the family dynamic. I use a small
canvas, the human heart. I'm interested in the dark side of human
nature, what it is that makes us kill each other instead of going
into therapy as we should.''

   The wooden roller coaster, the flagship of
amusement parks in the Roaring '20s, is making a noisy comeback.
One reason is nostalgia. Park operators say the traditional thrill
ride attracts older people trying to relive their youth. Others say
they are just simply more fun. Whatever the reason, new ``woodies''
are being built in cities across America.

   The walls in Curtis Summers' office show that
times are good for people whose idea of a good time is a
white-knuckle ride on a giant wooden roller coaster.
   On one wall is a drawing of the American Eagle that Summers
designed in 1981 for the Great America amusement park in suburban
Chicago. At the other end of the room is a picture of his Timber
Wolf, which opened last year at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City.
   In between are some of the coasters he designed in the 1970s,
and other examples of his newly booming business.
   ``We're working on No. 29 right now,'' Summers says.
   The past 10 years have been generous to traditionalists who
forgo the smooth ride of steel-framed roller coasters in favor of
roaring down rougher wooden coasters at speeds that can top 65 mph.
   In that time amusement parks have built 21 full-size wooden
roller coasters, from the Judge Roy Scream built in 1980 at Six
Flags Over Texas between Dallas and Fort Worth to Thunder Run set
to open at Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Ky.
   ``The last two or three years have been incredible for building
coasters in general, and wooden coasters are a big part of that,''
says Mark Wyatt, who edits the roller coaster newsletter Inside
Track.
   There are now 80 wooden roller coasters in the United States,
Mexico and Canada, along with 144 steel roller coasters.
   Three new ``woodies'' debuted earlier this year, all designed by
Summers: the Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas, the Georgia
Cyclone at Six Flags in Atlanta and the Predator at Darien Lake
Park near Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``I keep telling everybody you can't be too rich, too thin or
have too many roller coasters. They are the staple ride of a theme
park, and they make a great landmark,'' says Harold Hudson, a Six
Flags Over Texas Corp. vice president whose division supervises
coaster construction.
   Dallas-based Six Flags runs nine wooden coasters and 29 steel
coasters at its seven theme parks. Hudson says the company plans
two more coasters next year, both wooden.
   ``One reason is nostalgia,'' Hudson says. ``That's what coasters
were made of in the past and that's what everybody remembers. It
also has a little broader demographics. A wooden coaster might get
older people who might be interested in riding it.''
   Tom Timko, who runs an information hot line for the 2,300-member
American Coaster Enthusiasts, says the heyday for wooden roller
coasters was the 1920s, when an amusement park wasn't considered
complete without one.
   ``Then, with the Depression, a lot of parks closed,'' Timko
says. ``In the '70s, with Walt Disney World, they started to get
popular again.''
   A wooden coaster, The Beast, built in 1979 at Kings Island near
Cincinnati, has topped Inside Track's reader poll of the world's
best roller coasters for the two summers the magazine has conducted
the poll.
   ``The attraction, to me anyway, is that you have more freedom of
movement. You're out in the air. When you get in a steel coaster,
you're sealed in a little car,'' Wyatt says. ``The wood coaster is
a different feeling. They move a little bit to take the shock of
the train going around.''
   Summers says he has received inquiries about designing wooden
roller coasters for North Africa, Europe, Korea, Australia and
Singapore. He also is bidding to build the first wooden roller
coaster in Japan.
   ``There are very few wooden coasters outside of North America,
but the demand is ever-increasing,'' he says.
   Summers says a roller coaster he is designing for a Midwest
amusement park will surpass the 67 mph speed of the American Eagle,
as well as the Texas Giant's 140-foot height record among wooden
roller coasters.
   ``With present-day speeds, we just about have to build a Swiss
watch 150 feet high,'' Summers says. ``And you don't want absolute
smoothness. You want a little bit of roughness for that wood feel.''
   At Dorney Park in Pennsylvania, the Hercules coaster spreads
over a hillside that lets cars drop 157 feet in their first dip,
while the coaster's structure stands only 95 feet above the ground.
   ``It was a very smart move of them, using that hillside where
nothing else would fit,'' Summers says. ``It's dynamite to save
money on structure and get the world's highest drop on a coaster.''
   Competition for the title of the highest ``woodie'' was intense
enough to lead Dorney Park to sue Six Flags in federal court in
Pennsylvania. The parks settled in April, agreeing that while the
Hercules had the longest drop in the world, the Texas Giant had the
highest lift.

   Gil Gerard still remembers enough chemistry
to understand the environmental issues tackled in his new CBS fall
series ``The E.A.R.T.H. Force.''
   ``I used to be a chemist, and I can still boil water,'' he says.
   Gerard worked as a chemist in his native Arkansas after college.
He says he was in line to become vice president of a chemical
company when he decided to become an actor.
   In the series, which debuts on Saturday this fall, Gerard heads
an elite environmental group called E.A.R.T.H. Force. It stands for
Earth Alert Research &amp; Tactical Headquarters.
   The group's mission is to protect the environment from criminals
polluting the world's resources and from natural disasters.
   ``When I first began discussing this project I asked where are
we going,'' Gerard says. ``They said it would not be a crisis of
the week. People get bored with that. We're going to concentrate on
people stories, with an overview of the environment. If we tell
about an oil spill, the story will be about its effect on one
person.
   ``We also want to show people how they can deal with a big issue
like, say, depletion of the ozone level. People think they might
not be able to do anything, but if 20 million people watch the show
and do something, it'll make a big difference.''
   The series, the fourth for Gerard, also stars Joanna Pacula,
Robert Knepper and Clayton Rohner, and two Australian performers,
Tiffany Lamb and Stewart Finlay-McLennan. It is a joint
American-Australian production and will be made in Australia.
   Gerard plays Dr. John Harding, a heart surgeon and geneticist
and a former Green Beret.
   ``Harding's a guy who's not afraid to take chances,'' Gerard
says. ``I think he has a good overview of what has to be done. He
acts as a leavening agent for the more radical members of the force.
   ``There seem to be some people in the environmental movement who
seem more intent in polarizing issues than solving them. Harding
says let's solve it, not beat up on everyone. He looks for a common
ground.''
   Gerard made his series debut in the title role of ``Buck Rogers
in the 25th Century'' on NBC in 1979. He starred in two other
short-lived series, ``Sidekicks'' and ``Nightingales.'' The latter
show caused protests from nursing groups for its sexy portrayal of
student nurses.
   ``It seemed to be begging for some sort of reaction,'' he says.
``It was like two different shows. There was the show Suzanne
Pleshette, Barry Newman and I did and the one with the nurses.
Nobody was undressing when we did our part.''
   After completing ``Nightingales'' last spring, he starred as a
private detective in ``Final Notice'' for the USA Network. He has
an independent feature film, ``Soldier's Fortune,'' coming out
soon. In that, he plays a mercenary who returns from Central
America to find that his daughter has been kidnapped. Naturally, he
gets her back.
   Gerard says he hopes to be able to go to Australia early enough
to find a place on the beach to practice his avocation, scuba
diving. He also hopes to be close enough to the Great Barrier Reef
to get in some diving.
   First, he is off for several days at a training program in
Georgia conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. There he
will study techniques of surveillance and gathering evidence.
   Gerard's son, Gib, 8, is also off on a foreign visit. He will
accompany his mother, Connie Sellecca, on a vacation to Japan.
Sellecca stars in the new ABC series ``Baby Talk,'' based on the
hit movie ``Look Who's Talking.''
   When Gerard decided to switch to acting, he studied at the
American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York. He drove a
taxicab at night. He worked as an extra on the 1970 movie ``Love
Story'' and appeared in 450 commercials over the next six years. He
also had a role on the soap opera ``The Doctors.''
   He used his business experience to start a production company
and star in a low-budget feature film, ``Hooch.'' He moved to
California to play Lee Grant's lover in ``Airport '77.''
   A guest appearance on ``Little House on the Prairie'' led to
starring in a pilot movie written, directed and produced by Michael
Landon. The next year, he landed the title role in ``Buck Rogers.''
   Gerard has also starred in a number of television movies, such
as ``Help Wanted: Male,'' ``Hear No Evil,'' ``Runaway,'' ``For Love
or Money'' and ``Stormin' Home.''

   In a monumental undertaking, the Guthrie
Theater celebrates Shakespeare's history plays this summer with
stirring, sweeping productions of ``Richard II,'' ``Henry IV''
(parts 1 and 2) and ``Henry V.''
   They are not only monumental pieces of theater, but major acting
and logistical challenges for the regional theater, which was
founded in 1963 by Tyrone Guthrie.
   The three productions _ with the two parts of ``Henry IV''
combined into one play _ are being performed in repertory through
Sept. 2 with a special encore week of performances Oct. 9-13. They
employ two directors, the theater's entire 28-member acting company
and a trio of distinctive settings by design wizard Douglas Stein.
   The effort pays off handsomely. It's an amazing theatrical
journey through more than 50 years of English history. What makes
it special is the chance to see these plays together, to follow the
arc of this history from the doomed reign of the foolish, foppish
Richard II to the monarchy of the charismatic Henry V who rallies
his nation to military victory over France.
   These works are linked by many of the same characters _ watch
Bolingbroke turn into a troubled Henry IV or the hedonistic Prince
Hal grow into an impressive Henry V _ and they reverberate with
ideas that echo from play to play to play.
   Among other things, the plays are about power. How people use
it, and how power uses them. In ``Richard II,'' the king doesn't
appreciate the power he has until he loses it. Richard, in a
lyrical, galvanizing performance by Charles Janasz, gains spiritual
strength as he loses control of temporal power.
   He stands in contrast to Bolingbroke, who decisively takes
control of his life _ and the crown _ to become Henry IV. But once
king, he has little rest from guilt over Richard's death and
self-doubt about his ability. Stephen Yoakam admirably projects
Henry's world weariness, the machinations he must go through to
hold onto the throne.
   Prince Hal also undergoes a transformation. As played by Barton
Tinapp, he goes from roustabout to ruler with remarkable skill.
He's at home with Falstaff and the other rowdies at the Eastcheap
Tavern, but can dismiss them curtly when he is called upon to
fulfill his royal duty.
   Stein's innovative settings dazzle. There's a burnished copper
design for ``Richard II,'' a gnarled, rustic wooden environment for
``Henry IV'' and then bare, exposed rehearsal space for ``Henry V''
with glimpses of the sets from the first two productions as a
backdrop.
   The costumes, designed by Ann Hould-Ward, are opulent, except
for one stunning bit of theatricality in ``Henry V'' in which the
actors playing the English wear rehearsal clothes. The designer
perhaps took a cue from the opening chorus of ``Henry V,'' which
entreats the audience to use its imagination in seeing and hearing
the play.
   The three plays were co-directed with a fine sense of historical
pageantry and drama by Garland Wright, the Guthrie's artistic
director, and Charles Newell, a one-time resident director at the
theater.
   ``Garland and I decided early on that the only way we could see
it work was if both of us were responsible for everything,'' Newell
said in an interview. ``Each of us would do all of it.''
   The idea to do the history play cycle at the Guthrie came from a
plan to have Richard Iglewski, an actor in the company, play
Falstaff.
   ``In the winter of 1988-89, we did a reading of the `Henry IV'
plays just to listen to them,'' Newell said. ``And we realized
`Henry IV Part 2' had difficulty standing on its own.''
   Then Wright had the idea of cradling the two ``Henry IV'' plays
between ``Richard II'' and ``Henry V.''
   ``Suddenly, it became a very big project,'' said Newell. ``It
was decided the acting company wasn't ready to do that. But after
much thought on Garland's part, he decided that that very reason _
we weren't ready to do it _ was the reason we should be doing it.''
   The two directors began informally discussing the plays in July
1989. In September, historians and scholars were brought in to talk
about the history of the period, the manners of the time, the
difference between Shakespeare's history and actual history.
   ``Most helpful were professors of social history,'' Newell said.
``Scholars who could talk about what it was like to live in a
castle or what was an inn like and who was there and what did
people eat and drink. Things that, for actors, are very useful in
terms of understanding character.''
   Wright, Newell and Michael Lupu, the Guthrie's dramaturge,
worked on ways to transform the two ``Henry IV'' dramas into a
single work.
   ``We made a decision to try and tell the entire story of what
both plays were about in one play,'' Newell said. ``But we didn't
want to cut out major sections of the plays as a way to condense
it. Rather, we wanted to just trim everything that was there and
somehow compact it.''
   Rehearsals began March 13, nearly three months before the first
preview performance on June 9. The three shows opened June 30 in an
all-day, 12-hour marathon.
   Wright and Newell made an unusual decision about those early
rehearsals: The co-directors would do very little talking the first
month and let the actors find the plays on their own.
   ``We were there to guide and focus, but primarily we wanted the
company to discover the plays themselves as well as to discover
something about the actual rehearsal process itself,'' Newell said.
   The actors were encouraged to talk about the scenes they were
working on. ``It was scary for them because they didn't have a
single voice, or in our case, two voices telling them what they
were going to do,'' Newell said.
   ``We had rehearsals in which everybody was in the room at all
times, and anybody could say anything they wanted about the scene
that we were working on,'' he added. ``Suddenly the work became
about what the company is.''
   After a month of this work, Wright and Newell split into
separate rehearsals. But they maintained a dialogue with each other
that allowed them to shape the plays with equal input.
   ``One of the hardest moments was that first day of rehearsal in
which we were all sitting at tables that had scripts that came off
the table about 4 or 5 inches,'' Newell said. ``The sheer size of
the project was daunting. But like anything that big, you just do
it one step at a time and somehow you get it done.''

   In the heart of Asia, far from the tumult of the
Kremlin, a new mood of defiance and independence is taking hold.
This is the first installment of a four-part series by an AP
special correspondent who traveled through the restive Soviet south.

   Townsfolk in this ancient capital of
tiled turquoise domes and haunting memories are starting to refer
to the Soviet state in the same past tense they apply to Tamerlane
and Genghis Khan.
   ``The Soviet Union is rotting away,'' said Alex Ulko, a young
painter and English student at the University of Samarkand.
``Within a few years, Asians will be shaping their own nations.''
   Moscow is omnipresent in Soviet Central Asia, from government
offices and Communist Party headquarters to donkey-riding KGB
informants in remote hamlets.
   But new political currents, rooted in an Islamic religious
revival, economic resentment and environmental concerns, are
carrying Asian peoples inexorably further from the Kremlin.
   Although Lenin's iron-cast goatee still juts resolutely forward
in city parks, Asians revere their own wise men, in flowing white
beards and colored robes, who evoke a past few have forgotten, a
past almost palpable at night when Islamic chants can be heard down
twisting lanes shaded by mulberries.
   The five Central Asian republics _ Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia _ stretch from the Caspian
Sea to China, an area almost as big as the United States. Their 50
million inhabitants, 20 million in Uzbekistan, make up a fifth of
the Soviet population. A few examine 21st century problems in
nuclear physics and biochemistry, but many more live in rag tents
or mud hovels, as in the days of the Golden Horde.
   In some ways Central Asia is marked indelibly by a century of
Russian czars and commissars. But many here see the Russian
interlude as destined to be yet another turn of history, no more
vital to the present than when camels plied the Silk Road from
China to Europe.
   New political parties, ecological movements, Moslem clergymen in
reopened mosques and young radicals all press for broader freedoms
leading to independence. Even local Communist Party cadres are
insisting on greater home rule.
   ``Perestroika has brought truth, but truth has brought unrest,''
noted Agzam Rahmidov, an English professor in this old crossroads
city in Uzbekistan.
   For one thing, Central Asians complain of economic exploitation.
The Uzbekistan prime minister, Shukrulla Mirsaidov, contends his
people pay out three times as much to the central government as
they get back.
   In June, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan refused to export food to
other republics at the low prices decreed by the state. Later, the
Uzbek Parliament adopted a preliminary ``declaration of
sovereignty.''
   Anti-Moscow sentiment reaches deep into daily life.
   Russian settlers are leaving the region at a quickening pace,
spurred by sporadic pogroms against ethnic minorities. Youths are
evading the military draft and rebelling against officers they
accuse of bias.
   In a nation fraught with more immediate crises, these pressures
stew largely out of sight.
   In June, a border clash between Uzbeks and Kirghizis in the old
holy city of Osh commanded attention as the official death toll
mounted to as high as 800. But when Soviet troops imposed calm, the
spotlight moved on.
   ``The situation in Central Asia is very serious, and we don't
understand it fully,'' said Igor Krupnik, a conflict specialist at
the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. ``No one has the data.''
   The problem, Central Asians say, is that distant analysts are
often thrown off by convenient generalities about peoples who are
anything but homogeneous.
   Over millennia, borders were traced across the sands by
conquerors, from the Mongol hordes, to Turkish tyrants like
Tamerlane, to the Russian czars. Josef Stalin drew the last map in
the 1920s, when the regions of Turkestan and Eastern Bukhara were
transformed into five republics.
   The plains of Kazakhstan, biggest and northernmost of the five,
separate European Russia from Asia. To the south lie the other
four: in the east, the small mountainous enclaves of Tadzhikistan
and Kirghizia, bordering China and Afghanistan; in the west, the
highlands and deserts of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, stretching
toward the oilfields of the Caspian Sea.
   These Central Asian neighbors are linked by the Koran and often
by common linguistic roots. But just as often they are divided by
disputes over land and water.
   In the Soviet grand plan, the whole region was given over to
cotton. Fields were irrigated from the majestic rivers Amu Darya
and Syr Darya, and Russian migrants settled frontier lands. Today
only 40 percent of the Kazakhstan population is Kazakh.
   But decades of poor planning have so bled the rivers that they
no longer replenish the Aral Sea. Half of the world's fourth
largest lake has dried up, its exposed lakebed now just loose salt
poisoned by pesticide runoff. To revive the Aral Sea, Uzbeks want
to cut off the Karakum Canal, used by the Turkmens to water their
desert.
   ``Land was exploited in the most disgusting colonial way,'' said
Sergei Kapitsa of the Physical Problems Institute in the Soviet
Academy of Sciences.
   Central Asian planners want to diversify from cotton. But the
region is short of energy. And the Tadzhiks, ensconced in high
mountains, balk at flooding villages for more hydroelectic dams.
   In this climate of tension, an isolated skirmish over a piece of
scarce farmland, like the one in Osh, can flash overnight into
pitched battles in capital cities hundreds of miles apart.
   Explosive mixtures have resulted from past Soviet policies of
dispersing inconvenient minorities to once-remote areas, such as
the Fergana Valley, which includes Osh.
   Last year, rampaging Uzbeks killed at least 100 people in
pogroms against Turks resettled from Georgia almost two generations
ago. Other minorities, including Russians, were also targeted.

   This February, an estimated 50 people were killed in riots in
the Tadzhik capital, Dushanbe, reportedly touched off by rumors
that Armenian refugees would settle there. In May, mobs burned 47
homes of Armenians and Jews in the Fergana Valley.
   Authorities cite local causes for each outbreak, sometimes
blaming unnamed political opportunists, religious fanatics or
drug-crazed hooligans. But others see deeper roots.
   ``The problem is social frustration among a generation of youths
who are losing their old values and see nothing to replace them,''
said Munira Shadheedi, a historian in Dushanbe.
   Opposition politicians, mostly writers and other intellectuals,
see a policy vacuum as Communist Party stalwarts push ahead with
only modifications of ideas that have failed to inspire confidence.
   These new leaders say it is too early to design specific
programs for independence. First, most say, they must abolish
entrenched official corruption, which impoverishes and embitters
their populations.
   Alternative parties are beginning to attract wide support. The
Uzbekistan popular front, Birlik, has inspired similar movements in
other republics. Krupnik said he saw signs these disparate
opposition groups were linking up, forging the beginnings of a
grass-roots movement across Central Asia.
   Their main obstacle is a historical aversion to mixing among
ethnic groups in the region, he said.
   If Central Asia mixes anywhere, it is here in Samarkand, a city
of 390,000 people that recently celebrated its 2,500th anniversary.
   The old mud synagogue blends unnoticed into a block of Moslem
houses. Men of all religions wear the same square black skullcaps
embroidered in white. A multitude of nationalities sits together
for tea and patterned wheels of bread, escaping the sun under shade
trees.
   But a chat with Samarkand university students suggests that this
harmony of old is changing fast.
   A Crimean Tatar woman felt growing antipathy and said her family
wanted badly to get home. Her Russian-Ukrainian friend said Uzbeks
are making up for lost time in reasserting national pride.
   ``There is a very dark fear which is difficult to understand,''
concluded a young Russian, like the others reluctant to be quoted
by name. ``We see discrimination against others. The Russians are
next.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Mo' Better Blues' and `The Freshman'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Mo' Better Blues'' opens Aug. 3; ``The Freshman'' opened in
New York and Los Angeles on July 20 and will open wide July 27.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   ``Mo' Better Blues''
   The astonishing Spike Lee, surely the most original of new
filmmakers, succeeds where others have stumbled. He has made a jazz
movie that is both authoritative and entertaining.
   Bertrand Tavernier's ``Round Midnight'' and Clint Eastwood's
``Bird'' captured the essence of jazz, but were so doggedly
downbeat that they turned off average audiences.
   Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues'' has something for everyone: comedy,
sex, violence, drama, as well as some of the most sublime jazz to
be captured on film. The rendition of the title tune will haunt us
for years to come.
   Gone is the angry attitude of Lee's last film _ not that he has
mellowed out. His situations and his dialogue retain plenty of bite
(some may consider his portrayal of the two money-squeezing
club-owner brothers as anti-Semitic).
   The prologue is a brief vignette of a New York boy whose mother
won't let him go out to play until he finishes his trumpet lessons.
The boy grows up to become Bleek Gilliam (Denzel Washington), a
rising jazz star whose quintet packs the Beneath the Underdog club
every night.
   Bleek tries to balance his career _ with no help from his
boyhood friend and manager, Giant (Spike Lee) _ and romances with a
would-be singer (Cynda Williams) and a school teacher (Joie Lee).
Bleek's juggling act fails, with tragic results.
   ``Mo' Better Blues'' marks Denzel Washington's continued
emergence as a first-rank film actor. He is a commanding figure, on
the bandstand and off. Winner of last year's supporting actor
Academy Award for ``Glory,'' and twice nominated prior to that,
he's likely to be in the running for lead actor this time.
   At over two hours, ``Mo' Better Blues'' could stand trimming,
especially of the bickering scenes that may be unintelligible for
some ears. But Lee's originality shines through in every scene, and
there is even an unexpected sweetness in the way things are
resolved.
   The film is loaded with powerful performances, notably Wesley
Snipes as Bleek's sax-playing rival. The almost continuous score by
Bill Lee (Spike's father) adds richness, as does Ernest Dickerson's
burnished photography. The Brooklyn Bridge never looked so good.
   The Universal Pictures release is rated R.

   ``The Freshman''
   Marlon Brando is a brilliant actor but, let's face it, he's not
known for making audiences laugh. Heavy dramatic roles are his
forte. ``The Godfather'' and ``Apocalypse Now'' weren't exactly big
on chuckles.
   That's what makes it such a delightful shock to discover in
``The Freshman'' that Brando can be funny.
   In fact, he is the comic heart of ``The Freshman,'' a film so
hilariously crazy that it's plot defies extensive description.
   Matthew Broderick plays a New York University freshman film
student from Vermont whose misadventures in New York lead to a job
with Carmine Sabatini. The portly Sabatini is a Little Italy
businessman with an uncanny resemblance to Vito Corleone of ``The
Godfather.''
   This is Brando doing a parody of Brando, and it is so finely
crafted that it might discourage impersonators from attempting any
future ``Godfather'' imitations. Brando does it better than any of
his imitators could, and he never cracks a smile.
   Sabatini has the same husky voice, the gravel-in-the-mouth
delivery that makes some of his words incomprehensible and the
trademark slicked-down hair style and mustache that made Corleone a
part of American film history.
   Above all, he has dignity that extends to a scene in which the
bulky Sabatini is seen majestically ice skating _ a vision that
lasts long after the movie.
   Brando's plot relationship with Broderick adds an undertone of
warmth unexpected in such a broad comedy.
   Lest we doubt that parody is going on here, Broderick's
character, Clark Kellogg, attends film classes where the teacher _
a mad professor type played by Paul Benedict _ shows film clips
from ``The Godfather'' to his enraptured students.
   ``You know, the resemblance is incredible,'' Broderick whispers
when he is first introduced to Sabatini.
   The story of the ``Freshman'' is pure fantasy. Broderick is
commissioned to smuggle a giant lizard known as a Komodo dragon _
an endangered species member _ out of airport customs. This lizard
(actually another unendangered species) is a star. Reptile or not,
he's endearing. And when Bert Parks suddenly appears to sing,
``There he is, your Komodo dragon,'' you've got to love this movie.
   The lunatic genius behind it all is writer-director Andrew
Bergman who had the inspiration to add Bert Parks to a movie with
Marlon Brando, Matthew Brodrerick and a giant lizard. For good
measure, another film great, Maximilian Schell, shows up as a
crazed chef with a thick German accent. Broderick manages to bring
sweetness to a role that mostly requires him to look bewildered.
   ``The Freshman'' is an irresistible concoction with fine
performances from all involved _ including the lizard. But the most
memorable moments belong to Brando. This is acting at its finest in
a film that has no reason to exist except to entertain. Isn't that
refreshing?
   The Tri-Star picture is rated PG. Running time: 102 minutes.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Day With the Artist Tony Curtis</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He stands in a verdant patio, touched by the
dappled sunshine, and glances without a hint of indecision at an
empty canvas.
   ``I never have any trouble with painting; it just seems to burst
out of me,'' says Tony Curtis. ``There is such a joy and an
exuberance in it that I don't even think about what it should be or
what it will be, until I start it. Once in a while, some object,
some arrangement of flowers, some shapes, some colors will intrigue
me, so I will copy them.
   ``I do a lot of sketches and a lot of drawing. But I do that to
kind of inspire me. The ultimate experience is the painting.''
   Curtis is no Sunday painter. More than a hundred of his brightly
colored canvases, reminiscent of the French impressionist Henri
Matisse, have sold at prices ranging from $9,000 to $20,000. He has
had six one-man shows.
   The success comes at an opportune time in his life. After an
acting career that has known immense fame as well as depths of
alcoholic and drug despair, he seems to have found at age 65 an
ideal existence. He is often hired for character roles in features
and TV miniseries. Between jobs he paints, both here and in Hawaii
or on film locations.
   While building a new house and studio, Curtis makes the Bel-Air
Hotel his base in Los Angeles. He has a studio there, but on a warm
summer day, he decided to paint in a patio with lush greenery and a
burbling fountain. He paints swiftly, talking all the while.
   ``Since we're outside with a lot of green, I like the idea of
doing flowers,'' he explains. ``I like the combination of colors
and shapes. So I think maybe I'm going to do a still life of some
kind.''
   He begins with a piece of charcoal, swiftly outlining a vase
overflowing with flowers.
   ``I like this time of a painting, right now'' he muses. ``It
almost has a way of expressing itself. It sounds a little hokey, I
know, but it's almost as though the painting has a life of its own.
   ``No two paintings are alike. There are similarities, because
I'm the guy who's doing it. ... I like flowers. The most appealing
thing is the shapes and the combinations of the way they're put
together.
   ``Matisse? I'm influenced by all the artists; they are all my
brothers or sisters. When you stand before a painting by Matisse or
Picasso or Braque or Monet, you got to realize that you stand in
exactly the same space that they stood once. You know? If not
magical, but there's a mystery about that space. These artists are
telling you in silent language how to express your feelings.''
   Curtis stands back from the canvas and nods his approval of the
pattern. He immediately begins painting, squeezing gobs of bright
paint directly onto his brush. No palette for him.
   ``There was a time when I used a palette,'' he says. ``But I
find this way of expressing myself with bursts of color is the most
appealing for me. I like the way the strokes of the brush are
coming out. The nice thing about working with acrylics is that it
gives you the same feeling that oil does but you have to work much
quicker. You know? It's the quickness that gives it action for me.
   ``I always do go back to paintings and finish off little areas
that need more work. But these strokes now are setting the style
and the pace of the painting. This is a brand new experience for
me. So I'm paying a great deal of attention to it now. Except for
the bug that gets in the way.''
   He waves aside the insect and continues splashing the background
with layers of deep blue. To relieve the plainness of the
background, he etches a series of single lines, using a special
tool _ a beer-can opener.
   ``Wherever I am, I always use the objects that are available,''
he says with a smile.
   As he begins creating the flowers with brilliant hues, his
deeply tanned face becomes more intense. He retains the
handsomeness that helped make him a top star in the 1950s and '60s,
first in potboilers (``The Prince Who Was a Thief,'' ``No Room for
the Groom''), then in first-rate films (``The Defiant Ones,''
``Some Like It Hot'').
   Born Bernard Schwartz, Curtis received most of his education as
a gang member in the Bronx streets. An acting class in a settlement
house turned his life around, and after Navy service in World War
II, he returned to New York to work in summer stock and
off-Broadway.
   A talent scout brought him to Universal Studios where his looks
made him a teen-age idol. With ``Sweet Smell of Success'' in 1957
he proved his worth as an actor.
   His three marriages ended in divorce and produced six children,
including actress Jamie Lee Curtis.
   Marital and career problems were partly responsible for his
dependence on drugs and alcohol, which he kicked in 1983. He has
since kept busy in television (``Fall Guy'') and European-made
films.
   He has the same thick hair, now a distinguished white, that he
had in his younger days. And the voice still reveals his Bronx
upbringing as son of an immigrant tailor. As he continues painting,
he talks openly of his personal battle.
   ``In a way, painting helps you silence yourself,'' he says.
``Everything is so verbal. For a few minutes you can be quiet, and
nothing is interrupting your feeling of living and the joy of it.
You know, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm seven years into my
recovery. This is a great help to me, a great gift that has been
given to me. I don't know how else to say it.
   ``It has given me such a great pleasure in life, helped me
recover. Which is no easy trick. Recovery is not only from drugs
and alcohol and substances, it is recovery from emotions. Hate,
anger, envy, avarice, pain, fear. All of these are emotions, and
they're all addictive.''
   Art has long been a passion for Curtis, who started with
assemblages, collages and decorated boxes many years ago. Jan
Stussy, an art professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles, admired his work and invited him to attend courses on the
campus.
   ``I absorbed it like a sponge,'' Curtis recalls. ``I only had to
do a lithograph once to understand the logic of it. From there on
in, I was able to go off on my own.''
   He continues painting and talking and by the end of 40 minutes
the picture is complete, except for a few touchups here and there.
The artist stands back, nods with satisfaction and begins cleaning
his brushes. Amazingly, his white pants and white sweater remain
free of paint.
   ``There it is,'' he says. ``It makes me feel good, and I
appreciate you letting me paint for you, instead of just sitting
around and telling you how great I was in all my movies.''

<HEAD>The Artists: `War and Peace' Tests Seattle Opera</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``War and Peace,'' an opera based on Tolstoy's
epic novel of five families during the Russian victory over
Napoleon in 1812, is hitting a high note of musical glasnost.
   Even the final scene was redesigned for the $2.1 million
production of Sergei Prokofiev's rarely performed extravaganza,
tops among a series of Soviet-American performing arts ventures in
Seattle in conjunction with the Goodwill Games this summer.
   Stage director Francesca Zambello said initial plans called for
the victorious Gen. Kutuzov to arrive in a tank as soldiers and
peasants wave red flags, reflecting the Soviet triumph over the
Nazis after the opera was written in 1942.
   ``When the Berlin Wall came down, that's when we decided, `We're
going to have to change this,''' she said.
   Instead, Kutuzov walks onstage ``as more of a partisan, a sort
of man of the people,'' and Red Army trappings have been dropped in
favor of ``a broad stroke about people being freed from
oppression,'' she said.
   With nearly three dozen singers in 69 roles, an 80-member
chorus, more than 100 supernumeraries and 80 musicians, ``War and
Peace'' is the biggest project yet for the Seattle Opera, which
gained international prominence with annual performances of Richard
Wagner's ``Der Ring des Niebelungen.''
   The Seattle Opera became a Mecca for Wagner fans with annual
Ring performances from 1975 to 1987, the longest run anywhere
outside the composer's old home in Bayreuth, Germany.
   ``It's amazingly cast,'' said soprano Sheri Greenawald, who
sings Natasha. ``It's like Francesca was saying yesterday, `The
people are who they are cast.'''
   Singing opposite her as Prince Andrei is Vladimir Chernov, a
Kirov Opera baritone who recently signed contracts to perform and
record next spring with the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
   ``Seattle has gathered together fantastic musicians and
singers,'' Chernov said. ``One more time it demonstrates that music
has no nationality.''
   To demonstrate further, Chernov sang ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' and John Patrick, Napoleon in the opera, sang the Soviet
national anthem for about 65,000 people before a Fourth of July
fireworks show.
   Other principals include tenor Nicholai Ohotnikov and basses
Alexander Morozov and Miroslav Romanchuk, all Russians, and U.S.
sopranos Victoria Vergara and Sheila Nadler, mezzo soprano Stella
Zambalis and tenors Peter Kazaras and James Hoback.
   Bolshoi Opera conductor Mark Ermler directed the Seattle
Symphony Orchestra for performances July 22, 25, 29 and 31 and Aug.
2 and 4, plus taping sessions for high-definition television.
   The only previous operatic recording for HDTV, a new technology
offering much closer detail and greater depth of field than
standard television, was of the four-part Ring by a company this
year in Munich, West Germany.
   John Conklin designed the sets, Bruno Schwengl of Austria did
the costumes and Vasile Sulich of the Soviet Union is the
choreographer.
   Lydia Venichenko Barrett, owner of a Russian restaurant, says
``War and Peace'' has required the most work she has done for the
opera in 22 years as a volunteer translator, ranging from contract
negotiations to shopping trips to interviews with Chernov and
Ermler. She was their translator for this article.
   Ermler, who directed the Bolshoi Opera in ``War and Peace'' at
the Met in 1975 and in a recording for the Soviet label Melodiya in
1982, said he was impressed with the cast.
   ``They're very interesting people. They're very well-prepared.
Of course, there is some difficulty with the Russian (language),
but it will probably not be noticeable to the American audience,''
he said.
   Greenawald, a native of Monticello, Iowa, had no experience with
Russian before being cast two years ago.
   Before studying the libretto, she learned the Cyrillic alphabet.
She also read most of Tolstoy's novel.
   ``I must confess, I skipped a few battle scenes,'' she said.
   Now Greenawald says she's hooked. ``My next goal in life is to
sing more Russian repertory,'' she said.
   Chernov said he enjoyed the acoustics of the 3,000-seat Opera
House, built for the World's Fair in 1962. At the Kirov, rebuilt
after World War II, he said, ``we have to sing very loudly, and we
don't even look good when we have to scream to the people.''
   Zambello said artists from both countries had learned a lot from
working together _ including how to work together.
   ``Whenever we do a scene, we discuss everything first,'' she
said. ``The Russians, they're not used to that kind of practice.
They're used to being told exactly what to do.''
   After asking for instruction in the early stages, they
completely turned around and participated freely in the
give-and-take, she said. ``I have watched them open like flowers.
They're blooming, really. It's very exciting.''
   Ohotnikov, singing Kutuzov, is the only cast member with
previous experience in ``War and Peace.'' He was surprised when she
suggested he portray the czarist general as ``a Martin Luther King
kind of character,'' but he quickly got on the bandwagon, Zambello
said.
   Speight Jenkins, general director of the Seattle Opera, said the
interpretive style also was different for the Soviets.
   ``We're treating `War and Peace' in period but certainly with a
large degree of stylization,'' he said. ``The Russians, of course,
are 100 percent realistic, and we're not realistic at all.''
   Then there is the Russian school of singing _ baritones and
basses with a very dark, woody timbre. The Italian school, Zambello
said, is brighter.
   With many performers singing two or three parts, costume color
coding and other devices are used in addition to projected
supratitles to help audiences keep the huge cast of characters
straight, Jenkins said.
   ``There are 573 costumes,'' he said. ``I can honestly say that
we have never put anything more beautiful on stage than this basic
set.''
   Rather than such signature arias as ``Caro Nome'' and daunting
roles such as Violeta in ``La Traviata,'' the work offers ``a very
virile kind of romanticism that is extremely Russian,'' Jenkins
said.
   ``It demands great singers, but it is not a great vocal
challenge,'' he said.
   ``Where `War and Peace' is an enormous challenge is that it is
putting a movie on stage. It is a director's opera,'' he explained.
``It demands intense musical concentration from just everybody in
the cast. It defines ensemble opera.''
   Despite half an hour of cuts, the running time is four hours.
   ``So far as I know, this is the least cut production that has
been done in the United States,'' Jenkins said. ``The Russians
can't believe we've kept as much as we have.''
   Even in the Soviet Union, Prokofiev's opera is rarely performed
because of the expense, Ermler said.
   ```War and Peace' is a tremendous financial gamble,'' Jenkins
said. ``It's exactly like trying to put the `Iliad' on stage.''
   A recent one-for-two challenge grant gives the company through
Jan. 15, 1991, to raise $250,000 in donations to collect an
additional $500,000 from an anonymous donor, ``a real breakthrough
... a lifesaver,'' Jenkins said.
   Artistic success with ``War and Peace'' will prove ``the
capability of the Seattle Opera to pull off the largest and most
complicated operas in the repertory without compromise,'' Bailey
said. ``There's no doubt in my mind that audiences are going to
walk out completely overwhelmed.''

   The Pointer Sisters have always had this little
problem: They just can't stop talking. At home. On stage. In
interviews.
   They're wondes of nature, streams of consciousness rushing like
Niagara Falls. Just try getting through an entire sentence before
being blown away by Hurricanes Ruth, June and Anita.
   ``We just take over,'' laughed June, the others jabbering away.
``Sometimes we say the same things at the same time.''
   ``I know I can be doing something with my sisters on stage, just
doing a song, and I almost want to stop sometimes and just be
entertained,'' says Ruth.
   ``When we were kids our father would scream. My father would
whine about it,'' adds Anita, never coming up for air. ```WILL YOU
PLEASE JUST LET ME SAY SOMETHING.' And we'd just laugh. He'd say,
`You are the craziest people (Ruth and June join her here) I'VE
EVER SEEN IN ALL MY LIFE.'''
   More laughter. More stories. Call and response.
   ``Hey Ruth, remember when ... '' Laughter.
   ``No June, you were the one ...'' Laughter.
   (Sisters, can I PLEASE ask you a question?! Somebody help me!
This is isn't an interview, it's a matter of survival. What can you
do but press `record' and duck?)
   You'd never know it, but these are hard times for the Pointer
Sisters, squeezed around a small table in a Manhattan hotel, a
setting more suitable for a nice, quiet game of bridge.
   Sales have slowed considerably since ``Automatic,'' ``Neutron
Dance'' and their other hits from the first half of the 1980s. The
last two albums have flopped, and in 1988 they left their longtime
label, RCA Records, and signed with Motown.
   So now they're working extra hard, blaming the slump on bad
promotion and counting on a big push from Motown for their new
record, ``Right Rhythm.''
   ``We want concerts sold out in an hour,'' says Anita.
   ``We've grown closer to each other and our confidence has grown
now,'' insists June.
    ``We have a lot of different rhythms, different sounds, in our
voices,'' Ruth explains. ``Sometimes it's surprising and shocking
to me.''
   Musically, the Pointers are a little bit country, a little bit
rock 'n' roll and a whole lot of gospel and rhythm 'n' blues. Jazz,
too _ Louis Armstrong can be heard from another room.
   They cracked the charts in 1973 with ``Yes We Can Can,'' more
Andrews Sisters than Pointer Sisters, and three years later became
the first black women to ever perform at the Grand Ole Opry.
   It almost ended then. There were four sisters in the group at
the time, but Bonnie Pointer abruptly left for a solo career. The
others considered calling it quits. Even now, they have to hold
back the tears.
   ``We were devastated,'' Anita recalled. ``We weren't prepared
for it. We did a show that night when she left, and after that we
did have a period where we stopped. We thought this wasn't going to
work without Bonnie. We all tried different things.''
   But they bounced back, hooking up with rock producer Richard
Perry in 1978 and going gold with Bruce Springsteen's classic
backseat ballad, ``Fire.'' Over the next five years, the Pointers
just took over, and won Grammys in 1983 for ``Jump'' and
``Automatic.''
   ``Right Rhythm'' has plenty of good times (``Man With the Right
Rhythm''), some hard times (``You Knocked the Love (Right Outta My
Heart)'') and lots of wise words about life and love (``Friend's
Advice (Don't Take It)'').
   Levi Saucer Jr., James Carmichael and Marti Sharron share
production duties, but this is a Pointer Sisters record, and that
means every song is a Pointer Sisters song, no matters who gets the
credit.
   ``First of all we love some good lyrics that make some sense,''
Ruth said. ``So we don't have to get an encyclopedia to figure it
out. We can work on the music a lot of times. If the rhythm is
great and the lyrics aren't great, sometimes we just work on the
lyrics.''
   Talk to the Pointers about roots and that means church, their
father's church in Oakland, Calif., where they sang as children.
That's how they sound _ whether joining voices in song or
conversation. Gospel great Dorothy Love might as well have been
telling their story when she sang these words:
   ``Some get happy, they run,
   ``Other speak in an unknown dance,
   ``Some cry out in a spiritual trance,
   ``Have you ever seen the saints do the holy dance?''
   ``You know the part where we're on doing `I'm So Excited,'''
Ruth says, ``where I introduce the band? I've known these guys for
years, and I'd get so into having fun, I forgot the drummer's name.
I remembered his wife's name.
   ``I couldn't remember his name to save my soul and I got tickled
myself, and it was all because my excitement overwhelmed me. I sort
of lost my focus and just started having fun like I was just a
dance party somewhere and just being silly.''
   ``I think it's why R&amp;B and just regular blues music is so
emotional,'' June explains. ``Because it's spiritual _ a spiritual
feeling underneath it all when you're brought up that way. The
things that upset you maybe are probably more upsetting than
somebody who didn't have that background.''

   A few years ago, Reynolds Price was in a
bookstore and spotted the memoirs of his first editor, Hiram Haden,
who had recently died. The author immediately checked the index for
``Price, Reynolds.''
   ``There were like 20 pages,'' recalled Price, 57, whose
acclaimed first novel, ``A Long and Happy Life,'' was published in
1962.
   ``We hadn't seen each other for the last 10 years of his life.
But sentence by sentence, everything, all the fly
right. It was very fair in describing our parting of ways,'' he
said.
   ``It did say one thing that completely surprised me. It said,
`There was something about him when he was 29 years old which
suacts, were exactggested to me that he would not have a long life.' He
sort of
felt like there was an air that I would die young.''
   You'd never know from the picture that appears on the back cover
of a reissue of ``A Long and Happy Life,'' showing a ruggedly
handsome man with a closed, confident smile, the left arm pressed
against a relatively battered-looking tree, the other arm extended
down his right side.
   And you wouldn't guess it now. The title of his first novel
seems protold him of his gloomy forecast, Price recalls. A
good thing, too. If he really had died young, then his former
editor might have blamed himself for not warning him in time.
   ``... Raphael Noren watched his life and changed his story in
ways that kept it from closing in fear or waste,'' he writes in
``Tongues of Angels.'' Price seems to have taken that path, but in
a much calmer fashion, his optimism undiminished by age or illness,
his creativity shaped by a storyteller's love for words and the
spirit's gift for serious laughter.
   ``If you don't go crazy and you're not a junkie or an alcoholic
or a sex fiend, by the time you're in your late 30s, you've gotten
on top of an awful lot of problems. You've learned a lot of
skills,'' he said.
   ``Life is learning the direct way to get from A to Z without
floundering around all over the place. I think a lot of writers say
that writing gets easier as they got older. I think, ideally
speaking, you should just keep getting better until you're 85.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Grandpa Jones Grows Into Part</HEAD>

   After more than a half century
performing as a gentlemanly old man, Grandpa Jones is sure of one
thing: He's grown into his act.
   Little did he know that when he was 22, an offhand remark by a
colleague would earn him a lifelong nickname and career persona.
   ``Get up here to the mike; you're just like an old grandpa,''
radio entertainer Bradley Kincaid told him.
   Fifty-four years later, he's still getting in front of the mike.
And he's still everyone's grandpa.
   He's one of the few performers who's been on television
virtually every week since 1968. That was the first time ``Hee
Haw'' went on the air, and Jones has been on the country
music-humor show ever since.
   Chances are he's going to be on the small screen much longer.
Even if the one-hour program went out of production today, there
would be more than 20 years of reruns to use.
   Since he was 22, Jones has been on stage in a battered gray hat,
brown Western boots and brightly colored suspenders. A bushy
mustache fails to conceal a mischievous grin. A timeworn banjo is a
constant companion.
   ``They don't have to make me up too much anymore,'' he says
jocularly backstage at ``Hee Haw,'' referring to his age, 76.
   Every week on ``Hee Haw'' is a segment as traditional as the
show's famous corn field. Cast members ask in unison, ``Hey
grandpa! What's for supper?''
   He responds exuberantly with a lip-smacking menu of country food:
   ``Corn bread and gravy. Candied yams. Butter beans. Blueberry
cobbler. The more to eat, the more to spare.''
   Not even Jones recalls how the routine got started.
   ``It seems pretty popular. When I go out on personal
appearances, they holler that from the audience all the time. I
have to have an answer quick.''
   Fellow performers on ``Hee Haw'' call him ``Grandpa'' or ``Pa''
off stage. In fact, ``Hee Haw'' producer Sam Lovullo says,
``Everyone on the cast says he's their favorite.
   ``He means everything to the show. He's a link to traditional
country music we have with Minnie Pearl, Roy Acuff and others. He's
made a career off rural music and rural sayings.''
   George ``Goober'' Lindsey of ``Hee Haw'' and ``The Andy Griffith
Show'' tells this story about Grandpa playing in a celebrity golf
tournament. ``We gave him a pair of golf shoes. He said, `They're
pretty good shoes if I can just get these tacks out of the bottom.'
''
   Jones was born Louis Marshall Jones in Henderson County, Ky.,
the youngest of 10 children. He began playing mandolin and fiddle
as a youngster, and also learned to play a 75-cent guitar. But it
was banjo playing that earned him recognition.
   His family moved to Akron, Ohio, where in 1929 he won first
prize in a talent contest, winning $50 in $10 gold pieces.
   ``It bought me the first good guitar I ever had,'' Jones
recalled. ``I've been on stage ever since.''
   He has performed on the Grand Ole Opry country music show since
1946. In 1978, he was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Jones still makes up to six personal appearances a month,
playing such banjo favorites as ``Mountin Dew'' and ``Old
Rattler.'' His wife, Ramona, a fiddler, often joins him.
   He has entertained at such diverse venues as Carnegie Hall, the
Hollywood Bowl, various state fairs and the Smithsonian Institution.
   He says his biggest thrill was not on ``Hee Haw'' or at Carnegie
Hall but on a flat bed truck in rice paddies performing for
American troops in Korea.
   ``We got within 20 yards of the front lines playing for the boys
for four or five weeks,'' he recalled. ``The boys liked everything
you did because some of them hadn't seen anyone from the states in
nine months.''
   He says being on ``Hee Haw'' has been one of the many joys of
his long tenure in show business.
   ``I've had a big time. It's more like fun than a job. There's a
lot of good boys and gals on it. We've had a lot of fun and no
trouble,'' he said.
   ``It's like a comic strip: Something is going on every few
seconds. We're sort of like a family and we have good writers. All
of it together makes it a good show.''

   ``Just sing!'' Jackson Browne has heard the
audience taunts. Weary of his tireless politicking, many fans have
lost patience.
   Browne remains dedicated to his causes _ El Salvador, Amnesty
International and Nelson Mandela among them these days. Yet his
current 30-city concert tour is scarcely a litany of death squads,
human-rights abuses and anti-apartheid slogans.
   Instead, it is a celebration of some of plaintive ballads, such
as ``Farther On,'' ``For a Dancer'' and ``Before the Deluge,'' that
first brought Browne acclaim. The concert series, Browne hopes,
will be as much of a revelation for his followers as it is for
Browne himself.
   ``This is an acoustic tour, and the song list is open to
whatever can be played on two guitars and percussion,'' Browne said
in an interview. ``I can hear myself singing in a way I can't when
I play with a band.
   ``For a lot of people (in the audience), it's like hearing the
words for the first time. For me, it's the first time since I'd
written the words that I'd heard them. ... The whole purpose of the
tour is to highlight the writing.''
   In recent years, Browne has been more an activist than a
musician. Now, he says, he's heading back toward love songs. ``To
succeed with a political song, you have to get people to examine
themselves,'' he said. ``If you preach to them, you're lost.''

<HEAD>No Rest for the Weary: Priests, Nuns Face Bleak Retirement Picture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   They labored 60, 70, 80 hours a week in schools, hospitals and
parishes, turning an immigrant church into the nation's largest or
helping American Catholics achieve education and income levels on a
par with Protestants.
   Now, when their contemporaries are enjoying days of golf and
theater and retiring in comfort to Florida or Arizona, what earthly
reward awaits many of the nation's priests, brothers and sisters?
   More work.
   The priest shortage has led many dioceses to set their
retirement age at 75, while the dearth of vocations in religious
orders has led some nuns in their 70s to go out looking for work to
financially support their communities.
   ``The personal issue is not to be able to retire in this
particular culture until one is 75 is almost inhuman,'' said
Monsignor William Stanton of St. Ambrose Church in Buffalo, N.Y.
``How many people last that long?''
   As it is in American society, the prospect of widespread
retirement is relatively new for those who have sworn their lives
to the church.
   ``Once a priest, always a priest'' was the expectation of most
priests ordained before the Second Vatican Council in the early
1960s, said the Rev. David Brinkmoeller, executive director of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Priestly
Life and Ministry.
   ``That used to be the normal thing _ that people would die with
their boots on,'' he said.
   But as the church opened itself up to American culture, the
influence of Social Security and other programs that gave the
average person the expectation of a period of retirement in which
one would enjoy life gradually filtered into the priesthood.
   Ironically, said Monsignor Charles J. Fahey of the Third Age
Center at Fordham University, one of the motivating factors for
offering retirement programs was a glut of priests in top positions
that was clogging the traditional paths of advancement for younger
priests.
   ``It was about 1970 that the notion of the retirement of priests
began to come into parlance,'' Fahey said. ``At the same time the
rest of the country was doing away with mandatory retirement, we
were putting it in.''
   Sister Jane Frances Power said when she entered the Sisters of
St. Joseph of Orange in 1933 some of the younger members thought
anybody over 50 shouldn't be teaching.
   But demographic changes that once motivated dioceses to, in
Fahey's words, ``get the old bucks out'' now have them offering
incentives to keep priests, nuns and brothers working into their
70s and beyond.
   In 1989, 1 percent of Catholic sisters were under 30 and 41
percent were 70 and over. Of the nation's 155,000 men and women in
religious orders, 44,000 are past 70. The lack of younger members
bringing in income has resulted in a shortfall of retirement funds
estimated at more than $3 billion, and provided an incentive for
older members to keep working to help out.
   Power, who was for 30 years the chief executive officer of a
hospital in Fullerton, Calif., signed on three years ago at age 74
to become coordinator of health and hospitals for the Archdiocese
of Los Angeles.
   She is not alone.
   ``It certainly appears to us that there are a number of
religious who are still working part-time, if not full-time, into
their 70s,'' said Sister Mary Oliver Hudon of the Tri-Conference
Retirement Project. ``We have religious in their 60s who are
looking for other jobs. ... That's a new phenomenon.''
   Sister Jane E. Shappelle runs Project Encor in Cincinnati, a job
service started in 1987 for women religious 50 and over and whose
clients have included a 76-year-old woman with a doctorate.
   The pressure to keep working is particularly felt by priests, in
demand by a growing laity for a functions from Sunday Mass to
funerals and weddings.
   The number of American priests has dropped to 53,000 from 59,200
in 1970. The ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700
per priest in 1955 to almost 1,000 today.
   Pressures both overt _ not allowing full pensions before age 75
_ and subtle, such as ``pep talks'' from the bishop, are exerted on
diocesan priests to keep them in the pulpit.
   ``We have never followed a retirement age as we have
traditionally in civil society,'' said the Rev. Roland Faley,
executive director of the Conference of Major Superiors of Men.
``Most of the people that I know would want to continue working as
long as they're able.''
   Both Brinkmoeller and Fahey said that while there is no hard
data, dioceses seem to be pushing back retirement ages. In a recent
survey conducted by the Third Age Center of 156 dioceses, only two
reported a mandatory retirement age of 65. Twenty-four dioceses set
their retirement age at 70, while 114 reported a mandatory
retirement age of 75.
   Stanton, who at 66 runs a large parish and a parochial school,
said the 75 retirement age is unreasonable.
   In the Diocese of Buffalo, more than 85 percent of 283 priests
surveyed said they wanted a lower retirement age than the current
one of 75, with the majority favoring a retirement age below 70.
   Throughout the nation, Fahey said, ``there is a bit of a
collision course between the expectancies of priests and the needs
of the diocese.''
   The tension will increase, Fahey said, with the aging of priests
who were ordained after Vatican II and share more of the dominant
cultural perspective that one should expect an earned leisure
period in the final stage of life.
   Even with early retirement, most ordained men and women likely
would still help out in lesser roles, church officials said.

<HEAD>Multimillionaire Turns Soviet Base Into Clothing Factory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUINN LOTA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Willens, a businessman-peacenik, has
turned a military base in his native Soviet Union into a children's
clothing factory.
   There will be no money profits, but Willens, 75, expects a
return.
   ``I see this not as a gift or charity but as a sound investment
in the protection of everything I've talked about,'' he said.
``Having hostility between two nuclear powers is a clear and
present danger to my six grandchildren.''
   Willens, a multimillionaire who made his fortune in real estate,
said he's sunk about $400,000 into the project. By early July, he
said, the factory was operating at 75 percent capacity, turning out
100,000 pieces of clothing a month.
   ``The clothes are all beautifully made and very affordable,'' he
said, but he didn't have exact prices.
   The plant _ formerly the Kingisepp army base housing 6,000
soldiers _ is one of the first private enterprises designed to move
the Soviet Union away from weapons buildup and toward economic
independence.
   Joining Willens in the venture are Soviet actress Sophia Lansky,
who is project director and interpreter, and entrepreneur Ilya
Baskin of the Garant Cooperative in Leningrad. The base, about 60
miles southwest of Leningrad, officially was deeded to the
cooperative last year.
   Activism has long been part of Willens' life.
   The Don Quixote of the Dom Perignon set co-founded Business
Executives Move for Vietnam Peace in 1967. Two years later, he was
national chairman for the Businessmen's Education Fund, a group
concerned about growing military spending and foreign policy.
   He was an adviser to President Carter, and in 1978 was a member
of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations Special Session on
Disarmament.
   He also founded the Center for Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., and co-founded the Interfaith Center to Reverse
the Arms Race. In 1982, he was state chairman for the California
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze Initiative.
   And he wrote ``The Trimtab Factor: How Business Executives Can
Help Solve the Nuclear Weapons Crisis'' in 1984.
   Willens is known at the University of California, Los Angeles as
``someone who has been very active for years in arms control,
disarmament, peace and bettering U.S.-Soviet relations,'' said
Andrew Korbonski, professor of political science and head of UCLA's
Center for Russian and East European Studies.
   On his latest project, Willens said, he's met with some stodgy
resistance.
   ``On our side, resistance came from experts, including the Rand
Corporation. There was a combination of skepticism and an
accusation of naivete _ a question of `How can this nutty guy
believe that this thing can be helpful?'''
   George Regas, who co-founded the Interfaith Center to Reverse
the Arms Race, told the Los Angeles Times in 1982 that Willens was
``the most tenacious man I have ever met.''
   Willens was ``more than twice my age but has three times my
energy,'' Regas said. ``It stuns me. He'll call you at seven in the
morning and again at 11 the same night. It's as if the guy never
stops thinking about the issue.''
   The barracks-to-baby clothes-venture began in 1988 with an open
letter in a Soviet newspaper in which Willens offered U.S.
consulting gurus, free of charge, to struggling Russian businesses.
   He got several thousand responses. Meetings, letters and
telephone conversations followed as he played matchmaker between
U.S. experts and Soviet entrepreneurs.
   Soviet news media reported the bridging of communist and
capitalist ideals, and in the influential Soviety weekly Arguments
and Facts, Raisa Gorbachev sent the Americans ``warmest wishes.''
   In March 1989, the soldiers were kicked off the base and the
capitalists moved in.
   Willens was 8 when his family left the Soviet Union in the
aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution. Right after high school,
Willens worked as a grocery box boy 10 hours a day, six days a
week, for $10. His family of four lived on that income.
   These days, he can relax after breakfast at the posh Bel-Air
Summit Hotel.
   With all that's filled his life, one of the most satisfying
aspects is his relationship with his wife, he said in an interview
at the hotel. Their 55th wedding anniversary is Nov. 30. They have
three children.
   ``I've been lucky enough to meet the perfect partner in my life,
my wife, Grace,'' he said. ``That fabulous type of relationship
puts into life a flavor all too rare these days. I've been lucky
enough to be fulfilled.''
   Mrs. Willens has said that teamwork has made some of her
husband's visions reality. ``I've always supported whatever he
initiated. There'll be a discussion between us. He'll say, `You can
be a big help to me.' Boom, boom, boom and I'll do it,'' she told
the Times.
   ``Could he have done it without me? I think it takes a team to
do most anything. It's just too bad more (married) teams don't have
this experience.''
   Willens said he'd like to be 50 again.
   ``Having learned so much, it would be fun to do this again with
the additional knowledge I had gained,'' he said.
   But he is happy to share what he knows with his grandchildren.
Heather, a freshman at Stanford University, asked his help on a
project about the Soviet Union. Sara, 15, asked for his advice with
Shakespeare.
   ``You can see they realize Grace and I have a wealth of
experience. My advice therefore is for them to do what they're now
doing, remembering that their grandparents love them immensely,''
Willens said.
   ``It's sheer ecstasy that they can turn to our experience.''
   And what does he think of his status as one of the not-so-young
anti-nukesters?
   ``I'm a good example of what a person can do. I've done well,
now I'll do good. I'm a citizen as opposed to a resident. A
citizen, of course, is someone who cares about the country.''

<HEAD>Cookbook Author Simone Beck Turns 86, New Book on the Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLASCASSIER, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diets and retirement are anathema to
Simone Beck, master cook and teacher, co-author with Julia Child of
``Mastering the Art of French Cooking.''
   With her 86th birthday just past, she's looking forward to
publication of her fifth book next spring. It will be an intimate
autobiography, as well as a cookbook.
   ``Cooking can't keep you young, but it can surely help keep
fit,'' said Beck, sitting on the sunny terrace of her Provencal
farmhouse between Cannes and Grasse. ``Crash diets can do you
little but harm.''
   It has been 32 years since Beck, Child and Louisette Bertholle
published what became the first volume of ``Mastering the Art,''
the bible of French cuisine for Americans yearning to learn the
secrets of sauces like bechamel, Bordelaise or Hollandaise.
   A second volume by Beck and Child followed, with equal success,
while Bertholle branched off to write her own cookbooks.
Eventually, all three were doing their own thing.
   After ``Mastering the Art,'' Beck wrote ``Simca's Cuisine'' in
1972 (her friends call her Simca) and ``New Recipes'' in 1979.
   Although a celebrity in American culinary circles and mentor to
a couple of generations of American cooks, Beck is relatively
unknown in France.
   ``I hope my main statement in life _ my memoirs and new recipes
_ will take off when published by Viking next spring,'' said Beck.
   ``It doesn't have a title yet, but it tells all,'' she said with
a wink, ``including a bit about my love life. Also my tricks in
cooking, well known to my pupils. But I have new ones up the old
sleeve.''
   Her new book was inspired by Child's encouragement, Beck said.
   When Beck's husband, Jean Fischbacher, died in 1986, Child and
her husband, Paul, who have owned a house on Beck's property since
the 1960s, came over to give moral support.
   Child was fascinated by Beck's life, particularly some
hair-raising adventures during World War II, and persuaded her to
write it down.
   ``It's all in the book, including how I met Julia at a cocktail
party when I was looking for an American collaborator for a book of
French recipes,'' Beck said.
   ```Mastering' was an epic effort, a labor of love,'' 10 years in
which Beck, Bertholle and Child hashed over French techniques for a
trans-Atlantic audience.
   Writing her life story was another challenge. It recalls her
privileged childhood in Normandy, two marriages and her
professional life, weaving traditional and new menus and recipes
into the narrative.
   ``I'd learned food basics in Normandy with the family cook,
Zulma,'' Beck said. ``But when I was a young bride in Paris, I took
up bookbinding.''
   She won a prize, and looked around for something more
interesting. After she stumbled onto the Cordon Bleu school while
driving around Paris in the 1930s, she lured the top teacher, Henri
Pellaprat, home to help her prepare fancy dinner parties, jotting
down his tips. But she didn't start teaching herself until well
after World War II.
   ``During the war, I'd spent much of the time bicycling around
Normandy, bargaining with farmers to get food to send to my second
husband, who was in a German prison camp,'' she said.
   After the war, Beck became involved in cooking and teaching at
l'Ecole des Trois Gourmandes, founded by the co-authors of
``Mastering.''
   Later, Beck taught cooking on her own, giving lessons in her
Paris flat, at her guest house in southern France and on world
demonstration tours.
   Today, she teaches less, but likes to philosophize on food.
   ``Don't talk to me about nouvelle cuisine,'' she said. ``It made
food attractive-looking for anorexics, but that's about all. And I
never could stand eating raw fish, an abomination.''
   And she appreciates her audience in the United States.
   ``I always preferred to write for Americans,'' Beck said.
``French people think they already know everything about cooking.''

<BYLINE>Advertisers Catching on as Baby Boomers Mature?
^By KARIN MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That Americans are aging should have
marketers racing to attract a huge maturing generation, but they're
slow to catch on, an author said.
   ``You've got young creators and they're working from their own
value systems,'' said David Wolfe who wrote ``Serving the Ageless
Market: Strategies for Selling to the Fifty-Plus Market.''
   ``They have a sympathetic understanding of older people, but not
an empathetic understanding,'' he said.
   He cited Buick as a company trying to attract an older market,
with its 1991 Park Avenue, showcased recently in Nashville at the
National Association for Senior Living Industries exposition.
   Seniors gave the car's flat, plush seats a thumbs-up over bucket
seats, and the car also features safety features such as air bags
and has easy-to-use door handles.
   John Dabels, general director of divisional marketing for Buick,
said the car was redesigned after test-marketing showed older
consumers wanted different accessories.
   One complaint was: ``I don't want a cockpit. I want an
easy-to-read instrument panel,'' Dabels said.
   So the company designed a panel that wraps around to the
driver's door and has larger, more easily distinguishable control
buttons.
   Senior citizens ``want to buy an experience, not a product,''
Dabels said.
   Wolfe agreed. ``The gateway to experience is the No. 1 principle
of marketing to older people. They do not buy products for
services. They buy the consequential experience that purchase will
make possible.''
   Wolfe, who founded the National Association for Senior Living
Industries five years ago, said marketers are having a difficult
time with that idea.
   ``This is what's driving marketers nuts,'' he said. ``Older
people don't buy in such a way that they can be arranged in
groups.''
   Wolfe said the Infiniti car advertisements, which never showed
the product, had the right idea in showing the experience, but they
didn't follow through and grab the consumer.
   On the other hand, the McDonald's commercial that featured an
older man returning to the restaurant for a job he held as a young
man unexpectedly increased patronage by older people.
   ``They understand us,'' was the reaction of older consumers, who
were actually being targeted to work for the fast food company,
Wolfe said.
   The median age in this country is 33. By the end of the decade
it will be 39, Wolfe said.
   ``What we have is an aging society that is moving toward
agelessness. It is a worldwide movement. We need to understand it
to better be able to capitalize on it,'' he said.
   The term agelessness means that as a person grows older age
loses significance in terms of influencing behavior, Wolfe said.
   ``And what we're concerned with in marketing is human
behavior,'' he said. ``... It is the stages of life that we really
need to focus on, not the ages of life.''

   It had been about 70 years since William
J. Lockerman's son has asked him to take him to a magic show or
concert. But he gave in when his son insisted they go to the same
adult day care program.
   ``I don't like to change places often,'' said Lockerman, 95. But
once he got out of the house and joined his son, he was glad and
they've been going to the Queen Anne's County program daily for
more than a month.
   ``Being an only child, he always spoiled me a bit,'' said
William L. Lockerman, 77, who added that his father still tells him
what to do.
   The Lockermans are the first father and son to attend the
program, said Michele Mitchell, a nurse who accompanied the senior
citizens to a magic show recently.
   In addition to attending shows and concerts on Fridays, the two
men go on all the day trips, Mitchell said. They recently spent the
day at an auction and took a boat ride on the Miles River.
   At the center, the Lockermans like to coach pool and play
dominoes.
   Both were farm workers. The senior Lockerman retired at age 90,
and his son at 75.

<HEAD>Reverse Mortgages Can Be Avenue to Financial Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REBECCA GODKIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scene is common _ older people sitting in
their equity-rich homes struggling to pay the monthly bills. For
many, a reverse mortgage, also known as a home equity conversion,
may provide relief.
   Generally, reverse mortgages are available to individuals 62 or
older who owe nothing, or very little, on their homes.
   A homeowner entering into a reverse mortgage receives monthly
payments from the lender based on several factors, including the
type of mortgage selected, age and life expectancy, the value of
the house, the predicted value of the house at the end of the loan,
the interest rate, and the amount of equity available.
   Upon death or sale of the home, the loan is repaid. Currently,
there are three basic options from which to choose when selecting a
reverse mortgage: term, tenure, or line of credit.
   Under the conditions of a term loan, borrowers receive monthly
payments for a fixed number of years. Although the loan does not
have to be repaid until the house is sold or the borrower dies,
interest accrues on the amount received.
   Since term loans expire after a stated number of years, the
monthly payments received by the borrower usually are larger
compared with the other options.
   Term loans generally are best for those who actually plan to
move at the end of the term, thus avoiding additional interest
charges.
   Borrowers who choose a tenure mortgage receive monthly payments
for as long as they live in the home, and, like a term loan,
repayment is not due until the borrower dies or the house is sold.
However, since the exact duration of the loan cannot be determined,
payments normally are less than those paid under a term loan
agreement.
   A line of credit loan allows an individual to borrow against a
line of credit, as needed. The lump-sum amount available is based
on the aforementioned factors, and, once again, need not be rapaid
until the borrower dies or the house is sold.
   In conjunction with any of these loan alternatives, borrowers
may pledge all or a portion of the appreciation on the house to a
lender, increasing the amount of the monthly payments or the line
of credit.
   Upon death or sale of the house, the borrower (or the borrower's
estate) will be responsible for the repayment of the principal,
interest and the agreed upon portion of appreciation.
   As with any financing arrangement, there are advantages and
disadvantages associated with a reverse mortgage. Since a reverse
mortgage is nothing more than a loan, the proceeds are received
tax-free.
   The loans usually are non-recourse, meaning the borrower never
will be liable for more than the value of the house. The biggest
advantage, though, for many borrowers is the ability to continue
living in a house and neighborhood that have become familiar, while
at the same time using the house to increase the quality of life or
peace of mind.
   As for the downside, many people do not want to deplete what
generally is their single most important asset; they have worked
long and hard to pay off the mortgage and collect the deed from the
bank.
   They also may want, or feel it is their duty, to leave the house
to their heirs. Moreover, a premature sale of a house due to
unforeseen circumstances by individuals involved in a shared
appreciation reverse mortgage may cause them to end up both house
poor and cash poor. Borrowers still are liable for property tax and
insurance costs associated with the house.
   Lastly, because most reverse mortgages are non-recourse loans,
lenders are reluctant to offer them. In response to this
reluctance, however, the Federal Housing Administration is
sponsoring a pilot program that if successful, could lead to more
lenders willing to offer reverse mortgages.

   Sally Helgesen has some advice for the women
of corporate America: be yourselves.
   In a new book that follows four top female executives through
their workday, Helgesen argues that women shouldn't scrap the
values they were raised with to try and think and act like men in
the workplace.
   For more than a decade, thousands of aspiring women executives
in tailored pinstripes and floppy bowties have been told they need
to act more like men in the corporate jungle.
   So they took up golf, learned to like _ or at least understand _
football and surpressed their emotions. And just like their male
counterparts, they have sacrificed their personal lives.
   Instead they should focus on ``the values that women recognize
as a source of their strength _ values that for too long have been
dismissed as signs of weakness,'' Helgesen states in ``The Female
Advantage: Women's Ways of Leadership.''
   Those values include listening, teaching, favoring cooperation
with colleagues over competition, encouraging subordinates rather
than dominating them.
   At a time when a Fortune magazine cover story wonders ``Why
Women Still Aren't Getting to the Top?'' Helgesen's book looks at
``women's skills, talents and values as a plus that can add to
companies and organizations,'' she said during a recent interview
in Washington.
   The book takes a close look at the work day of four women: the
national executive director of the Girl Scouts of the United States
of America, in New York; the president of a Denver, Colo.-based
industrial contracting company; the chief of Ford Motor Co.'s
executive development center in Detroit and the head of a
Baltimore-based broadcasting company that owns three radio stations.
   Influenced by a 1973 landmark study by organization expert Henry
Mintzberg, who followed five male executives through their day,
Helgesen observed the work habits of four women who already hold
senior positions, writing down everything that happened to them
from opening mail in the morning to meetings and phone calls into
the evening.
   In contrast to the traditional corporate leaders, ``men of
vision'' who impose that vision from the top down, Helgesen's four
women have found what she terms ``a distinctive voice'' for
``stressing empowerment and human development rather than
subordination to the chain of command.''
   These women make time in their schedules to reflect, read or
simply rest. They make time for their families and expect their
staff to do likewise. They encourage creativity and downplay
hierarchy through structures that resemble a circle or web rather
than a pyramid, said Helgesen.
   They also pay attention to details and see the morning mail as
an opportunity to connect with clients and colleagues _ not a
distraction. Two even have in-house rules that all correspondence
must be answered within three days.
   One of the executives, Ford's Nancy Badore told Helgesen that
``Most women don't realize that they're good at their jobs until
about five or ten years after men do.''
   ``What I would like `The Female Advantage' to do is cut that
time from 10 years to two. Then I'd really feel like I made a
contribution,'' said Helgesen.
   But she said the book is not meant as an attack on the way men
manage.
   ``One of the things I believe is that women have benefitted
tremendously over the last 20 years by really studying how men do
things,'' said Helgesen, 42, a free-lance writer living in New
York's Greenwich Village, who was drawn to business topics after
writing a book about Texas oilmen.
   ``We've been reading books about strategic thinking and
assertiveness training and learning all these skills that a lot of
us were not really raised to have,'' she said.
   But the old-fashioned, male dominated, power-oriented corporate
hierarchy is on its way out, she believes, forced to change by
global competition, changing technology and an ever-increasing
female workforce.
   In its place, kinder, gentler corporate structures are evolving
where innovation is encouraged and winning the corner office at all
costs is not as important as being a well-rounded person who is
fulfilled on and off the job.
   As an example of this, Helgesen points to John F. Welch Jr.
president of General Electric Co., who goes home at 6 p.m. every
night and encourages his staff to follow his example.
   ``Part of what he has said is important to GE is people who are
able to spend time with their families and be rounded, whole
people. And when you get someone like the president of GE talking
like that, you know you've got tremendous change in values,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Report Forecasts 7.6 Percent Communications Spending Growth Thru

   Media spending will grow at a 7.6 percent yearly
rate to $461.3 billion by 1994, exceeding growth in the economy but
slowing from its 8.9 percent pace of the past five years, according
to a new study.
   The report from the investment banking firm Veronis Suhler &amp;
Associates, which specializes in media deals, covers spending on
media ranging from radio and TV to newspapers, books, magazines,
music and the movies.
   In its fourth annual industry forecast released Sunday, the firm
said communications industry spending would grow faster than the
economy from 1990-94.
   The firm expects the economy to grow 7.2 percent including
inflation for each of the next five years, up from 6.9 percent in
the past five.
   But it said communications spending will expand more slowly in
the next five years than in the past five because of ``maturation
of the technology-driven industries of the 1980s'' such as home
video, cable TV, compact disc recordings and business information.
   Broadcasting spending is expected to grow at a 7.1 percent
compounded annual rate to $46.2 billion by 1994, up from 5.8
percent for 1984-89.
   Network TV advertising spending, which rose at a slim 2.2
percent annual rate over the past five years as audiences fled to
cable and independent TV and other pursuits, will grow at a 6.6
percent annual pace through 1994, the report said.
   Spending growth at local TV stations will slow to 6.9 percent a
year from 7.5 percent in each of the past five years, the report
said.
   It said total TV spending will grow at a 6.8 percent rate to
$33.9 billion in 1994, up from 5.8 percent annual growth in the
past five years.
   Spending growth in radio will rise to 8.0 percent a year to
$12.3 billion by 1994, the report said. It had grown at a 7.6
percent rate in the past five years.
   The forecast for cable TV called for an 8 percent annual growth
rate to $19.5 billion in 1994, down from more heady 12 percent
annual growth in the past five years.
   Newspaper spending is expected to rise at a 6.7 percent annual
rate over the next five years, up from 6.3 percent a year in the
past five, and reach $61.8 billion in 1994. Annual growth at weekly
newspapers is expected to outpace growth at dailies, 7.9 percent to
6.6 percent.
   The report said growth in magazine spending will hold steady at
7.2 percent annual rate in the next five years, the same as the
past five, and reach $24.1 billion in 1994.
   Growth at consumer magazines will slow to 7.5 percent a year
from 8.0 percent, the report said, while growth at business
magazines is expected to accelerate to 5.7 percent from 3.9 percent.
   The report offered these estimates of annual spending growth in
other communications industry segments for the next five years:
   _8.2 percent for filmed entertainment, down from 17.0 percent
annual growth in the past five years, and reaching $35.2 billion in
1994.
   _5.3 percent for recorded music, down from 8.1 percent, and
reaching $8.4 billion in 1994.
   _8.3 percent for book publishing, down from 9.2 percent, and
reaching $26.9 billion in 1994.
   _8.6 percent for business information services, down from 11.4
percent, and reaching $32.2 billion in 1994.
   _8 percent for promotion, down from 9.4 percent, and reaching
$144.0 billion in 1994.
   _7.3 percent in direct-mail, Yellow Pages and misellaneouys
other forms of advertising, down from 8.5 percent, and reaching
$62.9 billion in 1994.

   Against a backdrop of Iraqi threats to
punish cheaters, OPEC ministers meet this week to work out a
strategy for restraining output and pushing up oil prices.
   ``The atmosphere will be very heavy,'' said Pierre Terzian,
editor of the oil publication Petrostrategies, based in Paris.
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at the Morgan Stanley
investment firm in New York, said: ``There is definitely concern
within OPEC about this turn of events, with Iraq making threats.''
   On Thursday, oil ministers of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries open their midyear conference to set
price and production guidlines. An eight-member monitoring panel
convenes a day earlier.
   A brief meeting had been anticipated until President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq threatened last week to use force if necessary
against Arab countries that surpassed their OPEC production quotas
and caused prices to drop.
   He claimed lower prices had cost his country $14 billion in the
last year.
   Saddam did not mention names, but he clearly meant Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates, which have violated their quotas
regularly.
   A week before Saddam complained, analysts said, Saudi Arabia and
four other Persian Gulf producers proposed an arrangement under
which Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates would reduce production
to 1.5 million barrels a day each. They had been pumping up to 2
million barrels a day.
   Analysts say the cartel probably will settle on an overall
ceiling of about 22.5 million barrels a day, not far from 22.1
million for the first half of the year.
   The International Energy Agency estimated OPEC production in
June at 23.2 million barrels a day, off 400,000 from May and down
nearly 700,000 barrels from April.
   OPEC ministers are considered likely to hold their price target
steady at $18 a 42-gallon barrel, but Iran and Iraq are expected to
press for a higher goal. Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's oil minister,
expressed hope last week that the cartel would lift its target to
$20.
   ``It's possible that, as a sop to Iran and Iraq, they will adopt
$20 immediately,'' said Lucy Mullins, analyst at the London firm of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   The OPEC meeting comes a week after the American Petroleum
Institute in Washington reported a higher U.S. dependence on
foreign oil. The API said the U.S. imported 49.9 percent of its oil
in the first half of 1990, the highest percentage since records
began in 1947.
   The August contract for the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
West Texas Intermediate, rose 62 cents Friday to $19.61 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had risen 44 cents a barrel
Thursday.
   Sadek Boussena, the Algerian minister and acting president of
OPEC, urged ``unity and discipline'' among members. The cartel's
news agency quoted him as saying: ``It is in the interest of
everybody to cooperate in order to stabilize oil prices and enhance
our revenue.''
   If OPEC is able to reduce production, even slightly, analysts
predict prices will rise.
   Terzian of Petrostrategies believes Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates have begun reducing output, and Mlotok of Morgan Stanley
said: ``I would expect, even with a little bit of leakage, as long
as OPEC stays under 23 (million barrels a day), prices would rise.''
   Prices have climbed recently, partly on the possibility of OPEC
production cuts. Traders also were nervous about Iraqi
saber-rattling, since the gulf region contains about two-thirds of
the world's proven oil reserves.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, closed at
$19.61 last week.
   In the spring, oil prices plunged far below OPEC's target of
$18, reaching $13.64 in June, then gained about $1 in July. The
price had been $20.46 in late January.
   Analysts attributed the spring decline to excess production and
weak demand by consuming nations. The oil held an emergency meeting
in early May to seek ways of halting the slide.
   They pledged production cuts of 1.445 million barrels a day to
get closer to the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels.
   The OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   The nation's beekeepers have launched a logo
campaign they hope will make life sweeter for consumers while
stinging manufacturers who use only token amounts of honey.
   Last August, the National Honey Board launched the ``Bear''
Facts campaign to authorize manufacturers to use its logo _ a
cuddly bear guzzling honey from a jug _ on products that have honey
as the primary sweetener.
   Mary Humann, acting executive director of the board, said the
campaign has a twofold purpose _ to help consumers identify
honey-sweetened products quickly by looking for the bear symbol and
to target products that use the word, honey, but only contain a
minute amount or a honey substitute.
   Each product is tested by a panel of food scientists to make
sure the board's criteria are met before the logo's use is allowed.
   More than 55 products _ from wine to bird food _ have added the
logo to their packaging, Humann said.
   ``We felt that it was a strong addition to our label. Honey has
a strong sweetener quality with a lot more positive impact,'' said
Patrick Ferrill, a spokesman for Ralston Purina, which makes Honey
Chex cereal.
   The campaign comes at a time when the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is researching proposed sweeping changes in food
labeling. One plan would require percentage listings for each
ingredient, which would give consumers a better idea of exactly
what they're buying, said Chris Lecos, FDA press officer in
Washington, D.C.
   Stuart Greenblatt, a spokesman for Keebler Co. in Elmhurst,
Ill., said the honey board campaign is one of several that have
cropped up recently in the food industry.
   ``Everybody is looking for something extra, some added value,''
he said.
   Keebler has five products, including Honey Grahams, that use
honey as flavoring, but not as the primary sweetener, he said.
Honey Grahams, which has been on the grocery store shelves for more
than a dozen years, was named after honey primarily to promote its
flavor.
   Gary Evans, president of Sioux Honey Association in Sioux City,
Iowa, which makes Sue Bee honey products, said apiarists are
worried by the trend toward capitalizing on honey's reputation
without using substantial amounts of the sweet, gooey substance.
   ``That's why, with the National Honey Board's help, we can kind
of police the industry,'' he said. ``Honey is getting to be very
popular. I think some of them are taking advantage of the word
honey.''
   Ferrill said he didn't know if the logo had gained recognition
among consumers yet, but ``we hope it'll improve the competitive
edge of our product and that's why we go to the trouble of putting
it on our product.''
   The National Honey Board was authorized by Congress and
established by the Agriculture Department in 1986 to promote honey
and honey research. Beekeepers pay 1 cent per pound of honey to
fund the board.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is running out of cash
for savings and loan bailouts with the job less than half finished.
   The administration panel that oversees the bailout, the
Resolution Trust Corp., has gained widespread praise for stepping
up its activities, but just as it is hitting its stride a cash
crunch threatens to slow progress to a limp.
   Analysts fear that a slowdown in the cleanup could just make the
S&amp;L mess worse, allowing struggling S&amp;Ls to continue to pile up
losses.
   The bulk of the S&amp;L cleanup lies ahead. Some 250 failed
institutions remain in government control, and at least another 250
failures are expected.
   But Peter Monroe, president of the administration panel
controlling the RTC's policy and financing, said the agency will
have only $7 billion in borrowing authority left after Sept. 30.
   That, plus the proceeds from any S&amp;L asset sales it manages,
will be all that's available to spend unless Congress comes to the
rescue.
   Congress authorized $50 billion last August and may have to come
up with another $50 billion for fiscal year 1991 beginning Oct. 1.
The issue is at the center of budget negotiations between the White
House and congressional leaders.
   ``Nobody should conclude that the major portion of the problem
has been dealt with. It hasn't,'' economist James Barth of Auburn
University said.
   The RTC announced ambitious plans last week to close or sell 77
failed thrifts in the July-September quarter, including some of the
largest now in government hands.
   Among them: City Savings Bank, Bedminster, N.J.; Empire of
America, Buffalo, N.Y.; and Merabank, Phoenix, Ariz.
   That will follow ``Operation Clean Sweep'' during which 155
institutions were closed or sold from April through June.
   In the roughly 210 institutions dealt with so far, the trust
corporation has had to keep about half of the institutions' assets.
It will take a major sales job to unload the sour loans, real
estate and junk bonds now in the government's hands.
   ``Most of the assets have been put on the books of the RTC, not
disposed of. ... And there are hundreds more institutions they have
to deal with,'' Barth said.
   Election-year politics is complicating the administration's
effort to get the money needed to finish the job. It was difficult
for many legislators to vote for $50 billion for the bailout last
August, with midterm congressional elections more than a year away.
   Now, with the S&amp;L mess the focus of many congressional races,
more lawmakers will find it impossible to, at least in the public's
perception, throw good money after bad.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
fears Congress may wait until a lame duck session after the
election to approve a budget deal, delaying new S&amp;L money until
December.
   ``We could get into a stop-start mode and that would be really
unfortunate,'' he said. ``We have picked up the pace, but we need
to maintain that pace for at least two years if the administration
is to declare by the summer of 1992 that it has cleaned up the
mess.''
   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, a trade group, said regulators may be tempted to use
a recently announced shift in bailout strategy _ finding acquirers
for failed thrifts before they are seized _ as an excuse to leave
insolvent thrifts open.
   That, he said, would be a return to the bad old days when the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board left hundreds of failed thrifts open
and piling up losses because the board didn't have the money to
shut them down.
   ``We're hearing now that the way to deal with institutions is to
somehow prop them up until bidders come along,'' Regalia said.
``But that's not good for taxpayers and that's not good for healthy
thrifts. ... I think the quicker we address this problem, the
better off everyone is.''

   Most manufacturers contacted in a survey say
improving their work force is most important for enhancing
productivity, but many continue to put their money elsewhere.
   In the survey by the accounting and consulting firm Grant
Thornton, 69 percent of the 250 manufacturing companies cited
productivity as a problem. About 12 percent called productivity a
``major'' concern.
   For 54 percent of those admitting to a productivity lag,
managers said people are the problem. Yet nearly four out of 10
manufacturers surveyed, or 38 percent, cited investment in new
plant or equipment as the single most important step their
companies have taken in the past three years to increase
productivity.
   In contrast, only 24 percent said investing in their workers was
their No. 1 answer to the productivity problem. Only 6 percent
mentioned pay incentives as a way to increase worker output.
   While most manufacturers already have incentive plans, ``many of
these programs offer room for improvement, particularly as they
affect production workers,'' said Michael N. Cantwell, chairman of
Grant Thornton's National Manufacturing Industry Committee.
   The telephone survey of mid-sized manufacturers was conducted
for Grant Thornton in February. The margin of error was plus or
minus 6 percentage points, it said.

   Share prices tumbled today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, and the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 526.73
points, or 1.62 percent, to 31,894.79. The index lost 634.10 points
on Friday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 300 million shares,
down from Friday's 500 million shares.
   In bond dealings, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 85.77 points as of 5:00 p.m. here, down
from Friday's close of 86.14 points. The yield was 7.465 percent,
up from 7.385 percent.
   The dollar closed at 148.50 yen, up 0.15 yen from Friday's
finish of 148.35 yen. It opened at 148.56, the day's high, and
fluctuated in a narrow 148.10-148.56 yen range.
   Spot transactions totaled a thin $8.021 billion, down from
Friday's $8.487 billion.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained almost unchanged
against the yen as the market took a wait-and-see attitude,
anticipating a slide in the dollar after its rebound Friday.
   The dollar was lower in the morning but advanced in the
afternoon session. Investors flocked to the dollar after the Nikkei
index shed nearly 600 points at one point, said Minori Takeuchi, a
dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Due to a lack of fresh market news, however, there's no sign
for any big movements (of the dollar),'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Currency dealers were expecting a further drop in the dollar's
value because preliminary figures for second-quarter U.S. economic
growth, to be released Friday, were expected to show a decline,
said Chiyuki Watanabe of Sanwa Bank.
   On the stock market, traders said today's decline reflected a
carryover from Friday's sharp drop. In addition, investors were
unwilling to make any big moves with the Japanese government bond
showing weakness.
   Arbitrage-related selling, in which professional traders attempt
to profit from slight differences between prices of stocks and
futures indexes based on stocks, also depressed prices, market
watchers said.

   Share prices were higher at midday Monday,
rallying from an early decline on the heels of a strong futures
market and aided by release of better than expected trade figures
for June.
   Dealers said the September Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100
index futures contract was driving the cash market higher as it
opened up a 75-point premium over equities. Normally the premium is
about 45 points, dealers said.
   The United Kingdom balance of payments data released Monday
morning were slightly better than expected, adding to the rally.
   The current account showed a June deficit of 1.36 billion
pounds, or $2.46 billion, compared with a deficit of 1.3 billion
pounds, or $2.35 billion, in May and a deficit of 1.73 billion
pounds, or $3.13 billion, a year earlier.
   Many analysts had expected the June deficit would have been 1.4
billion pounds, or $2.5 billion.
   At midday, the broad-based FT-SE 100-share index was up 4.1
points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,404.2. The narrower Financial Times
30-share index was up 2.5 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,900.6.

<HEAD>UAW, Big Three Get Down to Labor Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union and the nation's
Big Three automakers have given few clues about how labor
negotiations will progress during the next eight weeks.
   The UAW opened talks with General Motors Corp. on Wednesday,
with Ford Motor Co. on Thursday and with Chrysler Corp. on Friday.
The contracts expire Sept. 14.
   There were no surprises in the three opening days of bargaining,
and there aren't likely to be any in the next few weeks. Beginning
today, negotiating committees break up into subcommittees focusing
on specific areas, including job security, overtime and health-care
benefits and costs.
   At news conferences after the opening day of talks at each of
the automakers, union and management officials spoke mostly about
general concepts, except for Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony St.
John.
   Chrysler, the company which could be hurt the most in this round
of talks, said it proposed setting up a multi-employer health-care
trust. Like the other automakers, Chrysler has said it will be
seeking relief from the soaring costs of health care for its active
and retired employees.
   But unlike the others so far in the talks, Chrysler outlined a
method designed to do that. And Chrysler isn't limiting membership
in the plan to the automakers.
   St. John said Chrysler would consider hooking up with all sorts
of industries in the health plan. With a larger group, the plan
would have more clout with insurers and costs could be driven down.
   He also said formation of such a trust would get around a change
in accounting rules in 1993. St. John said the change, which would
require employers to set aside money in benefit programs instead of
paying as they go, could add $7 an hour to its labor costs.
   So far, GM and Ford have been cool to the idea.
   Chrysler and Wall Street analysts said Chrysler's second-quarter
earnings should be about half of last year's $341 million. The
company is expected to lose a considerable amount of money in the
third quarter when two of its most profitable plants close for
retooling.
   Shrinking profits, car and truck sales running 13 percent behind
last year's pace at the end of last month and the company's
health-care costs, which ran at a $684 million annual rate last
year, spell financial trouble for Chrysler.
   GM says it spent about $3 billion last year in health-care costs
and Ford said it shelled out about $781 million last year.
   The union has acknowledged that health-care costs are huge. It
has used that as a lever in its efforts to pry loose support for a
move to a national health-care plan.
   For that, the union and its supporters must negotiate with
Congress. For now, the UAW's focus is at the three automakers.
   The union is bargaining for somewhere around half a million
active and laid off employees. Nearly that many retirees also are
counting on the union to secure a boost to their pensions, which
they say have been chewed up by inflation.
   In the past, UAW contracts have set the model for other heavy
industries in the United States, but that's changed. Union
membership in the United States generally has declined _ the UAW
has shrunk by about a third to a million members _ and Japanese
competition has increased in nearly all manufacturing _ especially
in the steel and auto industries.
   There has been speculation that Chrysler will bolt from the
tradition the UAW has used of focusing on one company late in the
bargaining and using that contract as a pattern for the other two.
   But Bieber said Friday he doesn't intend to let that happen.
   ``This round of bargaining is on pattern and that's where it
will stay,'' he said Friday.

   The stock market was broadly lower in early
trading today amid sustained pressure from disappointing
second-quarter earnings.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials continued its retreat
from the 3,000 level, falling 22.28 points to 2,938.86 in the first
half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 258 up, 784 down and 458 unchanged.
   A flurry of disappointing quarterly earnings reports for the
second quarter pushed the Dow lower last week, and analysts
expected more bad news to hasten the decline.
   McDonald's had not yet opened for trading today after a poor
earnings report released late Friday.
   Adding to the downward pressure, prices of long-term Treasury
bonds fell sharply in early trading after a sharp selloff in Tokyo
overnight. Also, traders said there was little incentive to buy
bonds ahead of the government's monthly budget statement today,
which is expected to show a deficit.
   The widely watched Dow average, which measure the stock price of
30 large industrial companies, last week cracked but failed to
close above the 3,000-point level.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.29 to 196.36. The American Stock Exchange composite index
was 1.71 lower at 358.74.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.67 to
2,961.14, finishing the week with a net loss of 19.06 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 577 up, 904 down and 514 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 177.81 million shares.

<HEAD>Profit Rises Slightly in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. said Monday it had a 2 percent
rise in its profit for the second quarter because of a $31 million
one-time gain from the sale of some assets in a Japanese joint
venture.
   Without the gain, its profit would have fallen 11 percent.
   For the quarter, which ended June 30, the chemical giant had net
earnings of $247 million, or $1.90 a share, up from $241 million,
or $1.77 a share, for the same period a year earlier. Earnings per
share figures were adjusted for a two-for-one stock split in May.
   Sales in the second quarter of $2.36 billion were up 1 percent
compared with $2.34 billion for the same period a year ago.
   The $31 million gain came from the reorganization of Monsanto's
joint venture with Mitsubishi Kasei Corp. in which Monsanto and
Mitsubishi each retained certain products while a new joint venture
was formed to sell other products.
   Richard Mahoney, Monsanto's chairman and chief executive
officer, said extreme weather conditions around the world hurt the
company's second biggest division, agricultural products.
   He said sales of herbicides, such as Roundup and Lasso, dropped
off in several major markets because it was either too wet to plant
or too dry for weed growth.
   ``The weather is always a factor in our agricultural business,
but no year in memory has produced such difficult conditions for
our herbicides,'' Mahoney said.
   The company also had lower profits in its chemicals unit, the
company's largest division, because of the continuing slump in the
U.S. auto industry along with difficult economic conditions in
Brazil and Argentina.
   For the first six months, Monsanto had a profit of $441 million,
$3.37 a share, down 5 percent from the $463 million, or $3.39 a
share, earned during the first half of 1989.
   Sales for the first half were $4.65 billion, up 1 percent from
$4.61 billion in the first half of 1989.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. on Monday reported it
lost $108 million in the second quarter, an improvement from a year
earlier when it had a 66 percent larger deficit.
   The shortfall reflected interest payments and other costs
related to the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of the food
and tobacco giant last year.
   RJR Nabisco's red ink in the three months ended June 30 compared
with a loss of $319 million in the second 1989 quarter. The latest
loss was also narrower than the $222 million-shortfall posted in
this year's first quarter.
   Second-quarter sales grew 5 percent to $3.46 billion from $3.30
billion the year before.
   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer,
expressed satisfaction with the company's performance.
   ``By any measure, RJR Nabisco had a very successful quarter,''
Gerstner said. ``Both free cash flow and operating income were up
strongly. New product introductions remained at a high level in
both food and tobacco operations and margins continue to improve
across the board.''
   Operating income expanded 34 percent to $735 million from $547
million in 1989's second quarter. RJR Nabisco had free cash flow,
before proceeds from asset sales, of $637 million in the quarter.
   By midyear, RJR Nabisco's loss amounted to $330 million, 41
percent smaller than $558 million in the middle of 1989. Sales
through two quarters of 1990 totaled $6.66 billion, up 7 percent
$6.23 billion half way through 1989.
   New York-based RJR Nabisco is a major consumer products company.
Its R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. division makes some top selling
cigarette brands. Its Nabisco Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers
Co. subsidiaries are responsible for numerous well known snacks and
foods.

   The stock market was sharply lower in volatile
trading today, as the Dow Jones industrials average tumbled more
than 100 points before regaining some lost ground.
   A wave of computer program selling, weak corporate earnings and
concerns about broad economic factors sent stocks down at the
opening bell.
   In the first 90 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks was down 60.15 points at 2,900.99.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 87.09 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 139 up, 1,299 down and 353 unchanged.
   The sharp drop in the Dow followed a week in which the key
market indicator flirted with the 3,000-point level, breaking the
barrier several times but failing to close above it.
   The Dow average fell more than 107 points before rebounding. At
the same time, trading was halted for one hour in the Chicago
stock-index futures markets when the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 20 points.
   Analysts blamed the decline on continued disappointment with
second-quarter corporate earnings and on concern over larger
economic issues, such as the federal budget deficit and the costly
savings and loan bailout.
   A big selloff overnight in the Treasury bond market also help
pushed down stocks.
   ``I think we're in the midst of a substantial and abrupt shift
in psychology,'' said Eugene Peroni, technical research director at
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   ``There'll be more of a pessimistic attitude where some external
factors will not be as routinely ignored as they have been,'' he
said.
   McDonald's was down 3} to 31} after reporting

<HEAD>Crop Futures Drop, Following Stock Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were
substantially lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   An early plunge in the stock market of more than 100 points in
the Dow Jones industrial average triggered active selling in the
crop markets after a mostly lower opening. The loss in the stock
market was later trimmed.
   Favorable crop weather also weighed heavily on the corn and
soybean markets. A weekly Agriculture Department report due out
this afternoon was expected to show continued improvement in crop
conditions.
   Further pressure stemmed from a report in the Financial Times of
London quoting a high Soviet official as saying the Soviet Union
will import far less grain this year than last.
   Richard Feltes, director of commodities research with the
Chicago-based futures brokerage Refco Inc., said bearish
developments were pounding the crop markets from all sides.
   ``You've got supply, you've got demand, you've got fears of a
weakening economy. It's a triple-hit day for agriculture,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 3} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.97 a bushel; corn
was 2} cents to 3} cents lower with September at $2.56{ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to \ cent higher with September at $1.22 a
bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 9} cents lower with August at
$5.82 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .23 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August
at 76.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .25
cent higher with August at 87.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .17
cent lower to .30 cent higher with August at 59.87 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.2 cents lower to .28 cent higher with
July at 46.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures rose on Friday; pork bellies retreated.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
said Monday its profit rose 4.7 percent in the second quarter as
its sales climbed 6.9 percent.
   The diversified manufacturing company, also known as 3M, said it
earned $342 million, or $1.54 per share, in the three months ended
June 30 compared with $327 million, or $1.49 per share, a year
earlier.
   Sales in the second quarter rose to $3.234 billion from $3.025
billion in 1989.
   For the first six months, net income rose 5.0 percent to $677
million, or $3.05 a share, compared with $645 million, or $2.92 a
share, in the first half of last year.
   Sales for the first six months increased 5.9 percent to $6.398
billion from $6.042 billion in the year-ago period.
   ``Second-quarter results benefited from a pickup in our U.S.
unit-volume growth and from continued productivity-improvement
efforts,'' said Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The company's domestic unit volume increased about 3 percent for
the quarter, including strong growth in life sciences and solid
gains in the health care and traffic and personal safety businesses.
   3M also reported sizable volume gains in its industrial and
electronic segment, its largest which includes telecommunications
systems, electronic products and specialty chemicals, Jacobson said.
   Outside the United States, 3M achieved double-digit unit growth
for the 10th consecutive quarter, he said, although international
profits declined slightly from the second quarter last year.
   ``This reflected the impact of economic changes in Brazil,
negative currency effects and investments in new businesses,''
Jacobson said.
   ``The company estimates that the Brazilian situation reduced
second-quarter earnings by approximately 3 cents a share. In
addition, currency effects reduced earnings by about 1 cent a
share,'' Jacobson said.
   Jacobson said he expects higher sales and earnings for 3M in the
second half.
   ``We look for slightly stronger growth in the U.S. economy in
the second half,'' Jacobson said. ``This, coupled with ongoing
productivity-improvement efforts, should help U.S. results for the
balance of the year.
   ``In addition, our international profits will benefit from
continued solid volume growth, as well as from recent weakening of
the U.S. dollar and improvement in our Brazilian business,'' he
said,

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States increased by 21 this week to total 1,022,
according to a widely-watched index released Monday.
   The oil toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. reported this week's
increase reversed a series of declines, including a drop of 10 rigs
last week. A year ago, the count was 830.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the nuber of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The company has kept track of the rig count _ the widely watched
index of drilling activity _ since 1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Oklahoma posted the largest
increase with 11. Wyoming's count was up six, Colorado was up by
five and Michigan was up one.
   Texas, Pennsylvania and Ohio each gained three rigs.
   New Mexico's rig count was down by six, Louisiana lost four rigs
and North Dakota dropped one rig.

   General Mills Inc. and Nestle SA on
Monday announced an agreement to buy a British cereal company for
about $168 million through their joint venture, Cereal Partners
Worldwide.
   A partnership between the two companies, to be called Cereal
Partners UK, has agreed to buy London-based RHM Breakfast Cereals,
a division of Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC. The price was 93 million
British pounds, or about $168 million at current exchange rates of
about $1.81 for a British pound.
   The purchase has been approved by the RHM board of directors and
the transaction is expected to be completed on or before Aug. 17,
the companies said. The deal will include fixed assets, stock and a
piece of land adjacent to one of the premises.
   RHM Breakfast Cereals operates the third-largest breakfast
cereal business in the United Kingdom, making both branded and
private-label products.
   Cereal Partners Worldwide was formed earlier this year by Golden
Valley-based General Mills and Nestle to manage the development of
a major breakfast cereal business in Europe.
   The European ready-to-eat cereal market, the partnership's
initial area of concentration, includes $1.6 billion in annual
sales and is expected to quadruple by the year 2000 to sales of
$6.5 billion, the size of the U.S. market in 1989.
   The RHM cereal products command a more than 15 percent share of
the $1 billion British breakfast cereal market.

   The dollar fell sharply Monday against other major
currencies in Europe, hit by a sharp decline in a key stock market
index on Wall Street.
   Gold prices jumped more than $6 an ounce, boosted by the drops
in stock prices and the dollar.
   The dollar had been under pressure all day but activity was
modest until the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 100
points after the first 90 minutes of trading, dealers said. The
index later recovered but was still sharply lower at midday.
   The dollar was hit particularly hard in dealings against the
Swiss franc, which is supported by firm Swiss interest rates.
   The dollar stabilized somewhat after a nearly hour-long burst of
selling, dealers said.
   But they noted broader European interest in selling the U.S.
currency.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8215 from $1.8140 late
Friday. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at $1.8255.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates

   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.50 yen, up 0.15 yen from
Friday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 148.40

<HEAD>Greyhound Dial Posts Second-Quarter Net Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grehyound Dial Corp. posted second-quarter
earnings of $39.2 million on continuing operations, up from $35.6
million last year, but suffered an overall loss of $60.1 million
due to the bankruptcy of the bus line it sold in 1987, the company
reported Monday.
   Second-quarter revenues were $912.3 million, down from $925.5
million in the same quarter last year, the company said. Income per
share from continuing operations was 97 cents, up from 92 cents.
   Overall, however, the company sustained a net loss of $1.54 per
share for the quarter.
   John W. Teets, chairman, president and chief executive officer,
attributed the loss to a one-time, $100 million loss provision for
the bankruptcy of Greyhound Bus Lines.
   Greyhound Dial sold the bus line in 1987, but retained a 22.5
percent stake in the company's parent, GLI Holding, and also has
other Greyhound Bus Lines holdings.
   Greyhound Bus Lines sought protection from creditors in U.S.
Bankruptcy court in June. The action followed a March strike by bus
line workers.
   Teets said Greyhound Dial's consumer-products division had a
strong quarter, with operating income up 22 percent, paced by its
Dial bar soap and Liquid Dial anti-bacterial soap.
   Greyhound Dial's services segment, meanwhile, recorded an 18
percent increase in operating income, led by Greyhound Exposition
Services and Dobbs companies operations, Teets said. Travelers
Express, a leading issuer of money orders, and Premier Cruise
Lines, also posted strong second-quarter performances, he said.
   The transportation manufacturing division reported a sharp
decline in earnings and operating income, however, due to problems
with a major transit order and uncertainties in inter-city coach
sales resulting from the Greyhound Bus Lines strike and bankruptcy,
Teets said.
   The financial group, on the other hand, reported a 13 percent
improvement in net income, he said.
   Overall, he said the outlook for the company remains positive.
   ``The operating results of the second quarter, coupled with an
excellent first quarter, indicates the company is on target with
its plans and objectives,'' Teets said. ``This performance builds
on the fine results recorded in both 1988 and 1989 and demonstrated
that the company is in a strong position to continue its steady
growth.''
   For the first six months of the year, Greyhound Dial reported
revenues of $1.8 billion, up from $1.77 billion for the first half
of 1989. Income from continuing operations was $56 million,
compared to $50.4 million for the same period last year.
   However, the company reported a net loss of $43.9 million for
the first half of this year.

   Stock prices fell sharply on London's Stock
Exchange Monday, pulled down by a big decline on Wall Street.
   But British stocks rebounded from their lows to steady just
before the close.
   Most of the session was listless, as London investors found few
reasons for getting involved in the market during the usually
stagnant summer season.
   But once the New York Stock Exchange opened, and moved downward
decisively, London stocks began to decline quickly.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off by more than 100 points
before regaining some of the loss.
   By the close of the London trading session, the Dow Jones
average was off 69.80 points at 2,891.34, following Friday's
32-point decline on Wall Street.
   ``It came quickly and sharply and obviously sentiment has been
knocked in our market. But I wouldn't say there was an awful lot of
selling pressure,'' one London market maker said.
   Said another dealer, ``We're not strong enough to go it alone.
We're at their mercy.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 40.4
points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 2,359.7.
   The index's session low was 2,352.5 and its high was 2,406.3.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was off 31.0 points at
1,867.1 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell
18.83 points to close at 1,272.58.
   Volume came to 369.8 million shares, compared with 437.6 million
shares Friday.

   Citing eroding construction-related markets,
Manville Corp. on Monday reported second-quarter earnings of $52.6
million, down from $69.3 million a year ago.
   Shareholders also saw smaller per-share earnings during the
quarter _ 41 cents, down from 55 cents during the second quarter of
1989.
   Manville reported net sales of $561 million for the quarter,
down slighlty from the $564.5 million reported a year ago.
   For the first six months of 1990, the company reported net
income of $77.5 million, or 58 cents per share, down from $103.7
million, or 80 cents per share, in 1989. Sales were up slightly
over the first six months of last year, at $1.079 billion, compared
with $1.072 billion during the earlier period.
   ``Our second-quarter results reflect a mixture of forces driving
our company,'' said Tom Stephens, chairman, chief executive officer
and president of the Denver-based building products company.
   ``Construction-related markets continued to erode slowly, and
while demand for our coated paperboard products was strong,
packaging sales were down,'' he said.
   ``In Brazil, our domestic markets continue to be negatively
affected by the country's new economic program, but our exports
from Brazil remain on targe,'' Stephens said. ``We remain confident
about Manville's long-term prospects in Brazil and continue to
strengthen our position in worldwide paper markets.''
   Stephens said the competitive pressures in all of the company's
product lines are expected to intensify during the second half of
1990.
   While Manville deals primarily in building products, it also
makes fiberglass and industrial insulation products, paper and wood
products, packaging, roofing and filtration systems and is involved
in mining.
   Manville, which employs more than 18,000 people at 50 plants and
four mines worldwide, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 1982
as it faced billions of dollars worth of lawsuits stemming from the
company's previous asbestos-related business operations. The
company emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 1988 with a plan to
repay creditors and people claiming personal injury or property
damage from asbestos.

<HEAD>Clash Over Agriculture Postponed As Senior Officials Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the European Community on
Monday postponed a showdown over agricultural subsidies as senior
negotiators launched a new bid to speed the progress of talks aimed
at a more open global economy.
   But officials from Washington and Brussels made it clear that,
with less than five months remaining in the talks, there are still
vast differences over farm policy.
   U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Julius Katz said the United
States would continue pressing for elimination of trade-distorting
export subsidies.
   But Guy Legras, senior EC negotiator on agriculture, indicated
the 12-nation trading bloc would stand by its defense of export
assistance to help European farmers compete in world markets.
   Agriculture is the most contentious of the 15 sectors covered by
the negotiations sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. The talks were launched in Uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled
to end in December with accords to reduce barriers to trade and
expand rules into new areas worth an estimated $1 trillion.
   Negotiators from 105 countries in the talks are in Geneva for
the five-day meeting of the GATT's top-level Trade Negotiations
Committee to push the ambitious talks and identify the sticking
points.
   Arthur Dunkel, director-general of GATT, higlighted textiles and
services, such as banking and aviation, as two areas of impasse.
   Dunkel told a news conference that governments were ``playing
cat and mouse'' in the negotiations by making progress in one
sector conditional on their demands being met in another area.
   But he said there was a possible opening in talks on agriculture
reform.
   This was after an agricultural working group meeting agreed to
use a compromise proposal on farm policy as to intensify the
negotiations, as agreed by world leaders at the Houston economic
summit earlier this month.
   A statement issued by the group's chairman, Aart de Zeeuw, said
negotiations on substantive work would start at the end of August.
   The decision averts a crisis at the Geneva meeting, but merely
delays the inevitable clash.
   The compromise text by de Zeeuw focuses on cutting domestic farm
payments and price supports, and converting all import barriers
into tariffs which will be reduced.
   It is toughest on export subsidies and states these should be
reduced more than other forms of support and protection.
   Legras said the EC's still was strongly opposed to the proposals
on export subsidies. The EC Commission agress there should be
tightening of export aids but refuses to take firm steps to reduce
them.
   Katz insisted subsidy cuts must be a central part of any deal on
farm policy.
   ``It is not sufficient to have treatment of export subsidies as
a residual issue. The conclusion of the negotiations has to deal
with export subsidies with specific commitments,'' he said.
   Current state assistance to farmers costs consumers and
taxpayers an estimated $245 billion annually.
   U.S. President George Bush has warned that failure to reach a
satisfactory agreement on slashing farm supports will cause the
collapse of the entire Uruguay Round, risking further trade wars
and protectionism.
   The removal of agriculture from the agenda at the TNC meeting
leaves the 450 negotiators free to concentrate on other problem
areas.
   These include trade in textiles, worth some $177 billion in
1988. Trade is currently regulated by the Multi-Fiber Arrangement,
MFA, and not by GATT. Under this system import quotas are fixed in
bilateral deals.
   Washington wants to abolish the MFA and replace it with a global
quota system, with quotas negotiated on a multilateral basis and
increased over a ten-year period. Critics say a completely new
system would enable Washington to slip in new restrictions.
   There also is stalemate in efforts to set up a General Agreement
on Services to help liberalize services trade, worth at least $600
billion annually.
   Most countries favor an accord covering all sectors. But the
United States wants a narrower framework which would allow it to
continue bilateral deals which benefit the U.S. aviation and
shipping industry and offer some control over financial services.

<HEAD>Government: Some Price Differences Narrow Between Japan and Other
Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the sharp differences between prices in
Japan and other countries have vanished, although more competition
and deregulation are needed to narrow the gap further, a government
report said Monday.
   The Economic Planning Agency's report on prices also offered
little hope for change in the amounts Japanese pay for utilities
such as gas and electricity.
   Those charges were from 10 percent to more than 100 percent
higher than the prices paid by consumers in the United States and
Western European countries.
   The report said the weakening of the yen in foreign exchange
during the past year and lower yen prices in Japan had erased the
price differential between Japan and its Western trading partners
in international air fares, international telephone calls and
exported Japanese manufactured goods.
   That's good news for foreign companies that complain about
communications prices inflating the cost of doing business in
Japan. However, they get no relief in Japanese rents and land
prices, which are the world's highest.
   For Japanese consumers, relief is yet to come in the prices of
imported goods, many foods, energy and other areas, although they
do not have to worry about inflation sending prices even higher.
The rise in the consumer price index has been 3 percent or less
since 1982.
   Prices are lower than overseas in such areas as photo printing,
dry cleaning and facial tissues, the report said. Dry cleaning, for
example, showed New York at 105 on a price scale where Tokyo
equaled 100. Hamburg was at 147, London 138 and Paris 166.
   Price differentials were one of many areas covered in the recent
U.S.-Japan negotiations on structural barriers to trade. Japan said
it would try to reduce price differentials where possible and the
Economic Planning Agency report surveyed some of the recent
developments in that area.
   It attributed some price drops in Japan to market pressures that
followed the increase in the yen's value starting in 1985. That
increase made prices in Japan _ already high _ even higher when
quoted in U.S. dollars.
   But, the market mechanism ``does not work sufficiently if there
are regulations that hinder competition or if there are obstacles
in the distribution process,'' the report said.
   It said ``regulations should be relaxed and the Antimonopoly Act
should be strictly implemented.'' Both measures were important U.S.
demands in the trade talks, which ended in June.
   Yoshiro Tokunaga, director of the agency's Price Research
Divison, told reporters that high utility prices were due mostly to
high infrastructure costs and the need to build more power plants
to cover peak electricity demands in the summer.
   Regarding air fares, the report said in September 1988 a
traveler in the United States, Britain or France buying a ticket to
Tokyo paid only 74 percent to 82 percent of the price that a ticket
on the same route cost if bought in Tokyo. But early this month the
traveler outside Japan was paying 109 percent to 125 percent of the
Tokyo-bought fare.
   The report attributed the reversal to the gradual lowering of
yen-based air fares under market pressure, and to the weakening of
the yen, from 134 to the dollar in September 1988 to 153 in early
July. The yen recently has strengthened somewhat and closed at
148.50 against the dollar on Monday.
   The Japanese consumer suffers from high prices on imported
goods, the report said. American goods sell for 30 percent to 40
percent more in Japan than in other countries, and European goods
were 30 percent to 50 percent higher than in their countries of
origin and 20 percent higher than in the United States.
   The report blamed the difference partly on foreign companies'
strategy of charging high prices because Japanese consumers want
prestige brand names at almost any cost. Also responsible were
costs of adapting foreign products to Japanese standards, high land
and labor costs and the practice of sole import agents imposing
standard prices, it said.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic's Quarterly Net Up 6.2 Percent; Contel's Net Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. on Monday posted a 6.2 percent gain in
second-quarter income as both its telephone and non-telephone
business volume expanded.
   The regional telephone holding company said its net income came
to $362.8 million, or 92 cents a share, in the second quarter, up
from $341.7 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose nearly 7 percent to $3.08 billion from $2.88 billion in 1989's
second quarter.
   Separately, Contel Corp. reported that its second-quarter profit
contracted about 36 percent due to costs associated with the
purchase of 13 Southeastern cellular telephone systems from McCaw
Cellular Communications.
   Contel netted $43 million, or 27 cents per share, in this year's
second quarter, compared with $67 million, or 42 cents per share,
in the corresponding 1989 period. Revenue rose about 12 percent to
$844 million from $755 million.

   By midyear, Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic earned $718.1
million, an increase of 6.8 percent over the $672.5 million earned
during the first half of 1989. Earnings per share for the first
half were $1.82, up from $1.71 for the same 1989 period. The
per-share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock split April 10.
   Commenting on the quarterly results, Raymond W. Smith, Bell
Atlantic chairman and chief executive officer, said: ``Revenues
reflected continued growth in volumes in both our telephone and
non-telephone businesses and demonstrated the continued strength
and resiliency of our regional services-based economy.''
   Expenses of $2.39 billion included the January purchase of
Control Data Corp.'s third-party maintenance business and the June
acquisition of Northern Telecom's Meridian Business Systems Group.
   Bell Atlantic is the parent company of Bell of Pennsylvania, New
Jersey Bell, Diamond State Telephone serving Delaware, and the
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Companies serving Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   The corporation is also the parent company of businesses that
provide mobile communications as well as computer maintenance and
financial services.

   In the first half of 1990, Contel earned 26 percent less than it
did during the first two 1989 quarters, or $97 million, down from
$131 million. Per-share earnings fell to 61 cents in the first half
from 82 cents a year ago.
   Revenue through the first two quarters of this year rose 9
percent to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion.
   The latest results covered the quarter prior to the July 12
announcement that the Atlanta-based independent telephone company
had agreed to merge with GTE Corp. Under the merger plan, GTE would
issue 1.27 shares of its common stock for each outstanding share of
Contel common stock.
   In a separate report, Contel subsidiary Contel Cellular Inc.
said it posted a net loss of $29.3 million, or 29 cents per share,
for the recent quarter, compared with net income of $1.1 million,
or 1 cent per share, in the same period last year.
   Contel Cellular said the loss was due to financing costs and
amortization of goodwill relating to the 13 systems acquired in the
first quarter of 1990 from McCaw. Those costs totaled $31.6 million
in the second quarter.
   Contel Cellular said its revenue for the second quarter were $44
million, up from $15.2 million in the same period in 1989.

   The stock market fell sharply in volatile
trading today, as the Dow Jones average tumbled more than 100
points before regaining some lost ground.
   Waves of computerized program selling, weak corporate earnings
led by McDonald's and concerns about broad economic factors sent
stocks lower from the opening bell.
   ``There was panic without a doubt,'' said Chung Lew, head trader
at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc.
   The sharp drop followed a week in which the key market indicator
flirted with the 3,000-point level, breaking the barrier several
times but failing to close above it. Analysts said that failure
added to pessimism about the market's underlying strength.
   They blamed the broad decline on continued disappointment with
second-quarter corporate earnings and on concern over larger
economic issues, such as the federal budget deficit and the costly
savings and loan bailout.
   Computerized program trading strategies whipsawed the markets,
extending the morning drop and playing a role in a subsequent
rebound and another drop, market participants said.
   The program trading activity came despite a request by the New
York Stock Exchange that member firms voluntarily and temporarily
restrain from the activity, which has been blamed for intensifying
market volatility.

<HEAD>Government Might Sell Electricity Company to Hanson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government said Monday it might sell
the state-owned electricity generator PowerGen to British
conglomerate Hanson PLC rather than to the public.
   PowerGen would cost about 1 billion pounds, or $1.82 billion,
analysts said.
   PowerGen and the larger state-owned National Power are scheduled
to be privatized in February through the sale of shares on London's
Stock Exchange, as part of Britain's biggest privatization yet.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham said the government was holding
discussions with Hanson, the only company to approach him so far.
   In a statement to the House of Commons, Wakeham said that if
Hanson decides to make a binding offer for PowerGen, he would
invite other companies to place competitive bids.
   Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, confirmed his company had a
``firm interest'' in making a bid for PowerGen.
   Wakeham said that if a serious offer was made for National
Power, he would consider its private sale as well.
   Hanson owns considerable coal assets, including Peabody Holding
Co., the biggest coal producer in the United States.
   Since many PowerGen power stations are situated on the coast
with port handling facilities, Hanson coal could be easily
imported, analysts said.
   The government's willingness to consider other options ``may
indicate the feedback on the enthusiasm of the privatizations
hasn't been what the government might have hoped,'' said Arthur
Hepher, an analyst with the investment firm Laing and Cruickshank
Ltd.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off 28.3 billion pounds, or $52 billion dollars, worth of
state-owned companies since 1979 to promote capitalism in Britain.
   The sales have been largely successful. The notable exception
was the sale of the government's remaining one-third stake in
British Petroleum Co. PLC, which coincided with the October 1987
stock market crash. Investors shunned the shares, which were left
in the hands of underwriters.
   The government previously has privatized companies by selling
them to one buyer.
   The latest such sale, of the Rover car group, to British
Aerospace PLC in July 1988, was marred by the European Commission's
rebuke of the government for including hidden sweeteners for
British Aerospace.
   The EC last month ordered millions of dollars in sweeteners
returned to the government.

   The busiest month yet for the savings and loan
bailout ballooned the federal budget deficit to $11.2 billion in
June, a month when corporate tax payments usually produce a
surplus, the government said Monday.
   The shortfall, compared with a $7.8 billion surplus in June
1989, brought red ink for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to
$163.1 billion, more than half again as much as the $105.4 billion
deficit at this time last year.
   If the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace, it could
top the record fiscal-year deficit of $221.1 billion set in 1986.
The White House Office of Management and Budget is officially
forecasting a budget gap of $218.5 billion, just short of the
record.
   White House negotiators and congressional leaders are attempting
to put together a major deficit-reduction pact for fiscal 1991,
starting Oct. 1.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush would sit down with the leaders of Congress for daily ``hard
bargaining'' sessions for the rest of the week in hopes of reaching
an agreement.
   ``The president wants to give it a major push,'' Fitzwater said.
   Pessimism about the eventual success of those talks contributed
to the stock price tumble Monday, analysts said.
   Absent an agreement, OMB projects the 1991 deficit at $231.4
billion.
   ``The deficit is totally running out of control,'' said
economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington-based consulting
firm. ``Through January, the deficit was apparently in good shape.
Starting in February, it started going bananas.''
   Evans attributed the ballooning budget gap to S&amp;L bailout
spending and to sluggish economic growth, which is producing
lower-than-expected tax revenues.
   Bailout spending by the government's Resolution Trust Corp.
totaled $15.8 billion in June _ a third of its total spending
through June of $45 billion. June was the bailout's busiest month.
The RTC dealt with 83 institutions, bringing its total of bailouts
and closings to 207.
   Eventually, the government expects to sell real estate, loans,
securities and other assets inherited from failed thrifts. That
revenue should help reduce the budget deficit in future years.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
a sub-par 1.9 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter and
is projected by most economists to have grown at an even slower 1.6
percent rate in the April-June period.
   As a result, corporate tax collections, through June, were $72.5
billion, down 9.2 percent from the same period a year ago.
   All revenues totaled $110.6 billion in June and $777.7 for the
year to date, up 3.8 percent from the same period a year ago.
Spending totaled $121.8 billion for the month and $940.8 billion
for the first nine months of fiscal 1990, up 10.1 percent from 1989.
   The biggest spending categories, as usual, were the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $27 billion in June and $219.4 billion
so far this year, down 0.9 percent from 1989.
   Social security payments amounted to $24.6 billion for the month
and $183.4 billion so far this year, up 7.8 percent from 1989.
   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
17.9 billion in June and $144.1 billion thus far in fiscal 1990, up
12.1 percent from the same period in 1989.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $42 billion in June
and $210.2 billion for the fiscal year so far, up 9.9 percent from
1989.

   Wall Street was spooked by a sudden drop of more
than 100 points in the Dow Jones industrial average today, but the
battered market recovered nearly half the lost ground by the close.
   The Dow average, which had flirted with an all-time high finish
of 3,000 last week, plunged about 107 points in the first 90
minutes of trading. By the end, the average had struggled back to
2,904.70, down 56.44 points or 1.9 percent.
   The loss extended Friday's slump of 32.67 points and sent a
disturbing signal about the health of the market and the broader
economy.
   ``It just scared the hell out of everyone,'' said John Eberley,
head of equity trading at the Chicago Corp. ``It caught our
attention.''
   ``It went from sell to buy to sell again just between 9:30 and
11,'' said Leigh Stevens, a strategist at PaineWebber Inc. ``It's
unusual to see such back-and-forth like that in such a short time
span.''
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by 6-to-1 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where trading was heavy and hectic.
   As money was flowing out of stocks, it flowed into the bond
market during the early going, but long-term Treasuries finished
slightly lower on the day as stocks recovered.
   The abrupt drop in stocks also influenced the dollar's value,
which declined against the West German mark and British pound. But
the dollar strengthened against the yen in Japan, where stock
prices fell sharply overnight.
   The severity of the stock market drop was intensified by
computerized strategies known as program trading, which can dump
enormous amounts of shares on the market.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said the nation's biggest stock
exchange had asked for a voluntary restraint on program trading
after the Dow's sharp drop. Federal regulators also were paying
close attention to the market's behavior.
   ``We're aware of the situation and watching it closely,'' said
John Heine, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission
in Washington.
   The swift selloff caused a brief automatic halt in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract, an important influence
on stock prices, traded in the Chicago futures markets.
   The halt was triggered by a ``circuit-breaker'' mechanism put in
place by the financial markets in the wake of the crash of Oct. 19,
1987, when the Dow average fell a record 508 points.
   Brokers blamed the market's latest weakness on a number of
causes, ranging from disappointing corporate earnings reports of
leading U.S. companies, to the uncertain outlook for interest rates
and the economy, to the abrupt fall in Tokyo stock prices.
   ``This market behavior is going to discourage people,'' said
Chung Lew, head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc. in
New York.
   Some said investors were bothered by a report in The Wall Street
Journal this morning about the prospect of financial collapse for
the largest guarantor of student loans in the country.
   The account suggested the Higher Education Assistance
Foundation's $9.6 billion in loan guarantees may have to be
salvaged by the federal government, aggravating the problem of
easing the federal budget deficit, already overburdened by the
enormous cost of the savings &amp; loan bailout.
   Other brokers said the Dow drop was a symptom of the market's
performance in recent days. They said the average showed signs of
weakness in the past several trading sessions as it struggled
unsuccessfully to close above the 3,000 mark.
   ``I've been expecting a correction,'' said Lawrence Helfand, a
senior strategist at Rodman &amp; Renshaw, a Chicago investment firm.
``I wouldn't be surprised to see the market pull back 8 to 10
percent. There's lots of negative news around, with no real reason
to anticipate any positive news.''
   Although the 3,000milestone has proved elusive, the Dow average
of 30 industrial stocks has posted a string of new highs during
July, peaking at 2,999.75 at mid-month.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Selloff Pushes Dollar Down, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A selloff on Wall Street helped push the dollar
sharply lower Monday against most other major currencies in foreign
exchange.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, surged as a result of the dollar's
decline and as investors sought refuge from stocks, traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $369.10 a troy ounce, up $7.80 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $368.15 an ounce, $7.40 higher.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out softer amid
continued worries about falling interest rates, but it declined
more rapidly as traders around the world learned of the sharp drop
in stock prices.
   The closely watched Dow Jones industrial average, which measures
stock prices of 30 of the biggest U.S. companies, plunged around
100 points in the first 90 minutes of trading. It later regained
some ground before ending the session with a drop of around 56
points.
   Waves of computerized program selling, weak corporate earnings
and concerns about broad economic factors were largely responsible
for Wall Street's selloff.
   All that helped spook dollar traders, too.
   ``It was kind of a psychological thing,'' said Trevor Woodland,
chief coporate trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. ``If
you're a trader you're not going to buy a currency when the equity
market is faring poorly.''
   This is particularly true among foreign traders. As demand for
equity falls, so does the need to convert foreign currencies into
dollars to buy stocks.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed
at 148.50 yen, up 0.15 yen from Friday's finish. The dollar traded
lower at 148.40 yen in London, and at 148.19 yen in New York, down
from 148.65 yen Friday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound compared to
Friday. Sterling bought $1.8215 in London, up from $1.8140, and
$1.8255 in New York, up from $1.8185.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
levels, included: 1.62225 West German marks, down from 1.6385;
1.3815 Swiss francs, down from 1.4043; 5.4410 French francs, down
from 5.4965; 1,187.50 Italian lire, down from 1,200.00; and 1.15545
Canadian dollars, up from 1.15495.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday: 1.6278 West
German marks, down from 1.6410; 1.3880 Swiss francs, down from
1.4070; 5.4598 French francs, down from 5.5045; 1.8430 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8485; 1,192.00 Italian lire, down from
1,201.75, and 1.1568 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1565.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $368.15 an ounce from
$361.25 Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $367.75 an
ounce from $361.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 11 cents to close at $362.28 an
ounce.
   Silver prices also strengthened. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $4.882 a troy ounce, up
from $4.848 late Friday. Silver rose in London to $4.90 an ounce
from $4.87.

<HEAD>Quarterly Net Income Up 6 Percent at Baxter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical supply giant Baxter International
Inc. on Monday reported a 6 percent increase in second-quarter
earnings, citing stronger sales and higher profit margins than in
the second quarter of 1989.
   Baxter reported earnings of $110 million, or 37 cents per share,
for the three months ending June 30, compared with $104 million, or
35 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $2 billion, an 8 percent increase
over $1.9 billion for the second quarter of 1989, Baxter said in a
statement from its headquarters in Deerfield, a north Chicago
suburb.
   Baxter said its performance was even better than the bottom line
indicates because the 1989 second-quarter results included one-time
gains of $19.6 million, or 7 cents per share, from the sale of some
assets.
   ``Our performance this quarter was excellent,'' said Vernon R.
Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman.
   ``These results are consistent with our projection for at least
a 15 percent increase in operating income for the full year,
excluding our restructuring program costs,'' Loucks said.
   Early in April, Baxter announced plans to pare its workforce of
64,300 by 10 percent and close or sell 21 of its 100 manufacturing
plants in 24 countries.
   The company made a provision of $566 million in the first
quarter to cover the restructuring costs.
   Because of that charge, Baxter reported a net loss of $273
million, or $1.22 per share, for the first six months of 1990,
compared with net income of $205 million, or 69 cents per share,
for the same period of 1989.
   Six-month sales totaled $3.9 billion, an 8 percent increase from
$3.6 billion in the first six months of last year.
   Baxter spokesman Les Jacobson said he knew of only one plant
closed so far. But he said 500 to 700 jobs had been eliminated at
the company's headquarters and another 1,000 headquarters employees
had been transferred to the field.

<HEAD>Time Warner Posts Loss of $51 Million in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Monday it lost $51 million
in the second quarter due to costs and interest expenses related to
Time's $14 billion purchase of Warner Communications Inc.
   But the company said earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization climbed to a record $536 million for
the quarter, and said four of its six business segments _ films,
records, cable TV systems and programming _ had record second
quarters.
   Time bought controlling interest in Warner last July, but did
not complete its purchase of the rest of Warner's stock until
January.
   As a result, Time Warner presented its earnings both on an
historical basis, reflecting only a pro-rated portion of Warner's
results for 1989, and on a pro forma basis, stated as if the
companies were combined for all of 1989.
   Time Warner's loss of $3.29 per common share after preferred
dividends for the three months ended June 30 contrasted with a
profit of $92 million, or $1.65 a share, on an historical basis a
year earlier. On a pro forma basis, it lost $52 million, or $3.32 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter amounted to $2.59 billion, up more than
double from $1.22 billion a year earlier on an historical basis but
only up 4.4 percent from pro forma revenue of $2.48 billion.
   Time Warner said its filmed entertainment division earned a
second-quarter record $75 million before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, up 23 percent from pro forma
earnings of $61 million a year earlier.
   Its home video unit was a major contributor, with strong
worldwide sales of ``Tango and Cash,'' ``Lethal Weapon II'' and
``Christmas Vacation.''
   The recorded music and music publishing division earned a
second-quarter record $125 million before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, up from a pro forma $118 million a
year earlier. The latest results were led by strong domestic sales
from Madonna, Paula Abdul, Anita Baker and Keith Sweat.
   Second-quarter records were also set in earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $188 million in
the cable division and $46 million in programming. Pro forma
results were $160 million in cable and $43 million in programming a
year earlier.
   The company's magazine division had earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $85 million in the second
quarter, down from $99 million on a pro forma basis a year earlier.
   Results were affected by a soft climate for magazine advertising
and the anticipated startup costs at Entertainment Weekly, launched
in February.
   Its books division reported earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $17 million in the quarter, down
from $38 million on a pro forma basis a year earlier. The decline
was blamed on absence of profits from Scott, Foresman and Co., a
textbook publisher sold in December 1989.
   For the first half, Time Warner said it lost $102 million, or
$6.54 per common share after preferred dividends. It earned $146
million, or $2.54 a share, on an historical basis a year earlier
but lost $133 million, or $7.15 a share, on a pro forma basis in
the second quarter of 1989.
   Revenue for the first half amounted to $5.33 billion, more than
twice as much as historical revenue of $2.35 billion and up 6
percent from pro forma revenue of $5.03 billion.

<HEAD>Tyson Profit Up In Latest Quarter; IBP Net Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's biggest processors of meat, Tyson Foods Inc.
and IBP Inc., each reported strong profit gains for their latest
quarters on Monday.
   Tyson, a leading producer and marketer of poultry and other food
products, said its profit rose 21.8 percent in the three months
ended June 30, including results from its 1989 acquisition of Holly
Farms.
   IBP, the nation's biggest meatpacker, said its quarterly profit
nearly doubled due to strong consumer demand for beef and pork.

   Tyson reported earnings of $33.4 million, or 51 cents a share,
in its third fiscal quarter compared with $27.4 million, or 43
cents a share, for the third quarter of 1989. Revenue rose to 978.7
million from $606.1 million.
   For the nine months ended June 30, Tyson posted a profit of
$82.8 million, or $1.26 a share, compared with $69 million, or
$1.08 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.8 billion from
$1.6 billion.
   Tyson spokesman Gerald Johnston said the Springdale, Ark.-based
company was operating at about the rate expected following its
acquisition last year of rival Holly Farms.
   ``We're operating pretty well what we expected to be doing,''
Johnston said. ``The biggest part of the sales (increase) obviously
came from the acquisition, but we really don't have those figures
broken out.''
   Tyson acquired Memphis-based Holly Farms in June 1989 for $1.29
billion after a seven-month battle with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha,
Neb., for control of the poultry company.

   IBP posted a profit of $15.8 million, or 34 cents a share, in
its second quarter ended June 30. That compared with a profit of
$8.57 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales rose to $2.6 billion from $2.3 billion.
   ``Continued strong consumer demand for both beef and pork led to
the improvement in margins,'' said IBP's chairman, Robert L.
Peterson. ``A reduction in live cattle prices during the quarter
was also a factor. However, livestock prices remain high,
especially on the pork side.''
   IBP is one of the world's largest producers of fresh beef and
pork, employing 24,000 people in plants in the United States and
overseas.
   During the first six months of the year, IBP's profit nearly
doubled to $20.2 million, or 43 cents a share, from $9.9 million,
or 21 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to
$4.97 billion from $4.58 billion.

<HEAD>KCPL Makes $857 Million Offer for KG&amp;E</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Power and Light Co. made an
$857 million tender offer for Kansas Gas and Electric Co. Monday, a
move KCPL officials said would cut costs for both utilities and
delay their need to add generating capacity.
   KCPL executives say they could freeze rates for all customers
until Jan. 1, 1993 if the merger goes through.
   The offer, for $27 in cash per common share, would be financed
by a $1 billion credit agreement that KCPL has signed with two
banks, Westpac Banking Corp. and the First National Bank of
Chicago, company officials said.
   The share price offered is 37 percent more than KG&amp;E's stock
price Friday, according to KCPL. KG&amp;E stock, which closed at $19.75
Friday, closed at $24.37{ Monday on the New York Stock Exchange,
while KCPL's stock fell 87{ cents to close at $31.50.
   At least 90 percent of KG&amp;E's shares must be offered. The tender
offer also requires approval of state and federal regulators, KCPL
officials said.
   ``The only comment I can make is we have received the offer. We
will evaluate it. We will respond after that evaluation is
complete,'' said Lyle Koerper, a KG&amp;E spokesman in Wichita.
   Koerper said he did not know when the evaluation would be
complete.
   The offer is scheduled to expire at midnight Aug. 20.
   In a letter to KG&amp;E officials, KCPL's president and chief
executive, A. Drue Jennings, said the merger would make more
complete and efficient use of KG&amp;E's generating capacity and delay
KCPL's need to add capacity.
   At a news conference, Jennings said for several years he has
discussed the merger idea informally with Wilson Cadman, KG&amp;E
president and board chairman.
   Jennings described Monday's tender offer as a ``nudge.''
   ``Our companies are very good friends,'' he said. ``They've done
a lot of commercial business together over the past 25 years. I
think it's a good deal, I really do.''
   KCPL also filed a federal lawsuit Monday seeking a court order
requiring KG&amp;E to comply with a Kansas law that would require it to
call a special shareholders meeting within 30 to 50 days. The
meeting would be to authorize KCPL to vote all of the shares it
acquires through its tender offer.
   Jennings said his company proposes to expand its board of
directors by five members to add representatives from KG&amp;E's
service headquarters and to add a citizens' advisory commission to
represent consumers in KG&amp;E's service territory.
   Jennings said he was optimistic that both KG&amp;E and regulators
would be receptive to the offer.
   ``I think they'll appreciate what they see,'' he said. ``This is
a strategic combination that really does make sense. It probably
should have been done years ago.''
   KCPL has about 409,000 customers in 23 counties in western
Missouri and eastern Kansas, including the Kansas City area. It has
about 2,800 employees.
   KG&amp;E serves about 254,000 customers in southeastern Kansas,
including the Wichita area. It employs about 1,330.
   KCPL said it plans no layoffs if the merger goes through.
   The two utilities each own 47 percent of the Wolf Creek nuclear
power plant in southeast Kansas. Kansas Electric Power Cooperatives
Inc. owns the remainder.
   Jennings said the merger would not affect the hybrid corporation
that runs Wolf Creek or the plant's day-to-day operations.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Earnings Down 38 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tomm in 3rd graf is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. on Monday reported a
38 percent drop in second-quarter earnings, citing cyclical
softness and economic problems in Brazil where the chemical giant
has several plants.
   For the quarter ended June 30, after-tax income totaled $116
million, or 81 cents per share, on revenue of $2.1 billion,
compared to $186 million, or $1.33 per share, on revenue of $2.3
billion for the same period a year earlier.
   ``The chemical business is very cyclical, and we are currently
in the downturn of that chemical cycle,'' spokesman Tomm Sprick
said.
   Reduced sales of ethylene glycol, which is primarily used to
make antifreeze, contributed to the downturn, the company said.
   Union Carbide's Brazilian operations added just 3 cents per
share to second-quarter earnings, compared to 10 cents a share in
the second quarter of 1989, the company said in a news release.
   Increased sales and gross profit from the Brazil operations were
offset by high inflation, increased overhead, foreign currency
translation losses and higher income taxes in that country, the
company said.
   Robert D. Kennedy, Union Carbide president, said operating
profit and earnings improved 17 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, in the company's industrial gases operations,
excluding Brazil.
   The company's earnings for the first six months of 1990 totaled
$210 million, or $1.47 a share, on revenue of $4.3 billion. In the
first six months of 1989, the company reported earnings of $387
million, or $2.76 a share, and revenue of $4.5 billion.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Management Delighted With Newspaper-Saving Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute, cost-cutting agreement reached with
unions at Irish Press newspapers paves the way for the
Ingersoll-managed group to restore the titles to a prime position
in Ireland, the management said Monday.
   The group, Irish Press Newspapers Ltd., was founded nearly 60
years ago by former Irish premier and president Eamon de Valera. It
is 50-percent owned by embattled U.S. publisher Ralph Ingersoll's
British company, Ingersoll Publications Ltd.
   The group reached the agreement with the National Union of
Journalists and the Irish Print Union on Sunday, just before it was
to close down the Irish Press, Evening Press and Sunday Press.
   The settlement calls for 200 voluntary layoffs, the immediate
start of the use of new technology, and the introduction of a basic
5-shift, 35-hour work week throughout the company.
   Journalists have been working a four-day, 28-hour week.
   The 750 workers had rejected the same proposals on Thursday.
   ``We are delighted with the agreements we have reached with the
Irish unions. The Irish Press Group has been at the heart of Irish
national life for 60 years,'' said James Plugh, chief executive of
London-based Ingersoll Publications.
   ``Through the use of the latest technology, our newspaper
expertise, and the remarkable pool of creative talent in Ireland,
the way is now clear for our partners and ourselves to restore the
Irish press titles to their preeminent position in the Republic of
Ireland,'' he said.
   Ingersoll Publications, which bought a half-stake in the
newspaper group in December 1989, also manages the newspapers.
   The remainder of the company is owned by Irish Press PLC, the
company founded by de Valera, and now chaired by his grandson Eamon
de Valera.
   Ralph Ingersoll, hit by his heavy debt load of mostly junk
bonds, and a downturn in the U.S. newspaper industry, relinquished
ownership of his U.S. newspaper company, Ingersoll Publications Co.
earlier this month.
   The New York investment firm E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co., his
partner for seven years, agreed to acquire all the stock in
Ingersoll's three American companies which publish daily newspapers
in New Haven, Conn., Trenton, N.J., and other cities.
   Ingersoll closed down his startup daily newspaper the St. Louis
Sun earlier this year, after seven months of publication.
   The publisher, who has said he believes there are more
publishing opportunities in Europe, agreed to acquire Warburg's
50-percent interest in the British Ingersoll company, which also
owns the Birmingham Post and Mail, Coventry Evening Telegraph and
other British newspapers.

<HEAD>Chrysler to Offer Stripped Down Shadow-Sundance for '91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will offer special
versions of its 1991 Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance cars to
recapture market share lost when the Dodge Omni and Plymouth
Horizon died, the company said Monday.
   The cars will be called ``America'' versions and carry base
prices of $7,599 for a two-door version and $7,799 for the
four-door model.
   Chrysler said the Shadow and Sundance America cars would be
offered with a limited number of options. Each will have a driver's
side air bag.
   The Omni and Horizon cars, versions of which Chrysler also
marketed as ``America'' models, ended when the Jefferson Avenue
assembly plant in Detroit shut down Feb. 2. Since then, Chrysler
has effectively been out of the subcompact market.
   In 1989, Chrysler sold 79,500 Omni and Horizon cars and 167,288
Sundance and Shadow cars.
   The ``America'' versions of the Shadow and Sundance are seen as
plugging a hole in Chrysler's lineup until the company either
develops a new subcompact on its own or joins with an overseas
automaker to develop such a vehicle.
   There has been speculation that Chrysler has been talking with
the Italian automaker Fiat SpA about making a subcompact based on
the Fiat Tipo sold overseas. Chrysler and Fiat officials have
declined to confirm or deny such speculation.
   Chrysler officials said earlier this year that introduction of a
new subcompact to take the place of the Omni and Horizon wouldn't
take place until the mid-1990s, after the company introduces an
all-new mid-size car code-named ``LH.''
   In addition to the Shadow and Sundance America cars, Chrysler
also said that it would introduce upscale versions of the same
vehicles and a Shadow convertible. Prices for those cars will be
released later.

<HEAD>Gold Hits 2-Month High On Weak Stocks, Mideast Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in two months
Monday as sharply lower stock prices, a weaker dollar and signs of
Middle Eastern buying fired investor interest in the metal.
   On other commodity markets, silver also advanced, stock-index
futures tumbled; energy futures climbed; livestock and meat futures
retreated; and grains and soybeans were mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $7.70 to $7.80 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in August up
$7.70 at $369.70 a troy ounce. The spot July contract settled at
$369.10 a troy ounce, the highest settlement of a spot gold
contract since May 22.
   Silver futures settled 3 cents to 3.4 cents higher with July at
$4.882 a troy ounce.
   Gold opened with a surge in New York following news of a large
purchase of gold bullion in London that analysts believe originated
in the Middle East. Some previous Middle Eastern transactions have
been large enough to swing prices wildly, leaving the market
sensitive to signs of Middle Eastern interest.
   Shortly after the strong opening, the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged 107 points, sending many stock investors fleeing to
the perceived safety of the precious metals.
   The stock market slowly trimmed its losses throughout the day.
But gold remained strong, with new support stemming from higher oil
prices _ an inflationary signal _ and a weaker dollar.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,
said the Federal Reserve Board's recent moves to lower interest
rates have been a boon to the gold market.
   ``It looks like some foreigners are concerned about the
possibility that (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan's stance toward
inflation may be weakening, which pulled the props out from under
the dollar,'' Savaiko said.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said reports of new violence in South Africa surfaced shortly after
the close, which could give gold prices another boost on Tuesday.
   The stock market's slide prompted sympathetic selling on many
commodity markets.
   Stock-index futures, which sometimes shadow and sometimes lead
the stock market, also fell sharply in early trading and closed
with smaller, although still steep, losses.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Standard &amp; Poor's 500
futures settled 7 points to 7.25 points lower with September at
357.80. The contract is valued at $500 per point.
   The September contract fell 12 points early in the session,
triggering a ``circuit breaker'' trading halt designed to guard
against a stock market collapse.
   Energy futures continued to rise amid optimism that OPEC oil
ministers meeting this week in Geneva will agree on measures to
reduce their crude output and raise prices. OPEC's mid-year meeting
begins Thursday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 49 cents
higher with September at $20.50 a barrel; heating oil was .71 cent
to 1.06 cents higher with August at 56.5 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .39 cent to .70 cent higher with August at 63.35 cents
a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, led by limit losses in the pork-belly market for the
third time in the last four sessions.
   In addition to weak bacon demand and lower cash markets, bellies
were pressured by Friday's monthly Agriculture Department cold
storage report, which showed larger stocks of frozen bellies than
the market had expected.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent to .63 cent lower with August at
76.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .58 cent lower
with August at 87.30 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.02 cents lower
to .13 cent higher with August at 59.70 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.67 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with July at
44.20 cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of
Trade, erasing most of the losses posted early in the session.
   Analysts said the main influence in the crop markets probably
will continue to be bearish fundamentals that include good weather
for corn and soybean developement.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
six-to-10-day outlook predicting normal temperatures and
above-normal rainfall for the Midwest in the first half of next
week.
   The USDA released its weekly crop-progress report after the
close, showing little improvement in the corn and soybean crops,
with development well behind the norm.
   The USDA reported the winter wheat harvest was 83 percent
complete as of Sunday, which is near the average pace.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $3.01} a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 4} cents
higher with September at $2.64 a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 5\
cents higher with September at $1.27 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 3{ cents higher with August at $5.91 a bushel.

   Nestle Enterprises Inc. will not proceed with
an expansion of its Stouffer Restaurant Co. and instead will try to
sell the subsidiary, the Swiss-owned conglomerate announced Monday.
   ``The decision follows an extensive evaluation of the long-range
business strategy of Nestle in the United States,'' Nestle
Enterprises stated.
   Nestle, one of three American subsidiaries of Swiss-based Nestle
SA, reported it would begin ``an orderly process of preparing the
restaurant group for sale.''
   Stouffer operates 65 restaurants, including outlets under the
names of J.B. Winberie, James Tavern, Rusty Scupper and Parkers'
Lighthouse as well as the ``Top'' restaurants in New York, Boston,
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio, and Cleveland.
   James M. Biggar, Nestle Enterprises chairman, said operating
restaurants is better suited to specialty chains and entrepreneurs
than a large corporation.
   He said Nestle will focus its efforts on its Nestle Foods Corp.,
Nestle Hills Coffee Co., Stouffer Foods Corp., Stouffer Hotel Co.,
the L.J. Minor Corp., Wine World Estates, Sunmark Inc., and
FreshNes Foods Corp.

<TEXT>
   The French government said Monday it will provide
state-owned Thomson SA with the equivalent of $540 million over the
next five years to finance research and development of
high-definition television.
   The Industry Ministry said the electronics company has agreed to
a program that sets specific targets in terms of research, product
development and the launch of a product.
   Thomson has linked up with NV Philips of the Netherlands in a 20
billion franc, or $3.6 billion, high-definition TV joint research
and development program over five years and has already devoted 6
billion francs, or $1.08 billion, to its research. Under the
agreement signed in May, Thomson will put up 9 billion francs, or
$1.62 billion of the total amount and Philips the remainder.
   The French group is one of the 14 founding members of a group of
European broadcasting and telecommunications companies that are
seeking to have high- definition TV operating commercially in
Europe by 1992.
   The European standard is incompatible with that being developed
by Japanese manufacturers.
   High-definition TV offers better picture and sound quality than
conventional television.

<TEXT>
   The stock market was hammered Monday in a
chilling reminder of past crashes as the Dow Jones industrial
average plummeted more than 100 points before recouping about half
of its decline.
   In its biggest drop since January, the Dow average of 30
industrial stocks _the market's best known barometer _ finished
down 56.44 points at 2,904.70, extending Friday's 32.67-point
decline. In the broader market, virtually all market indicators and
industry groups were lower.
   ``There was a whiff of panic in the air,'' said Jack Conlon,
head of equity trading for Rothschild Inc. ``Clearly there was a
good deal of damage done.''
   Still, the decline was only the third worst of 1990 _ the Dow
industrials tumbled 77.45 points on Jan. 22 and 71.46 on Jan. 12.
It left the Dow average above the 2,900 mark, although it has
largely retreated after coming within a whisker of 3,000 last week.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
227 up, 1,430 down and 365 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 209.03 million
shares, up from 177.81 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 250.50 million shares.
   Waves of computerized stock selling programs, weak
second-quarter corporate earnings reports, and concerns about
inflation and interest rates thrust stocks lower from the opening
bell.
   The New York Stock Exchange asked member firms voluntarily to
restrain from program trading, but the request did not appear to
have much impact as buy and sell programs whipsawed the market
later in the day. The activity has been blamed in the past for
contributing to big intraday price swings.
   Traders said the speed of the morning tumble was reminiscent of
the 1987 market crash and the October 1989 selloff that scared away
individual investors and helped bring on a recession in the
securities industry.
   The market lost 107 points in the first 90 minutes of trading
before quickly recovering about 50 points. It then drifted lower
and hovered there until a spurt just before the close.
   A sharp decline in two key stock-index futures _ which link
trading in the stock and futures markets _ triggered a
``circuit-breaker'' in the Chicago index futures market prohibiting
the products from trading at lower levels for 30 minutes.
   Helping lead the drop was a weaker-than-expected earnings report
by McDonald's, which fell 3 to 33 and was the most active NYSE
issue. The report was issued too late Friday for the market to
react.
   ``An earnings surprise in a supposedly stable stock like that is
going to spook people,'' said Phil Roth, chief technical analyst at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Blue-chip stocks declined across the board. IBM fell 1} to 115~,
Philip Morris lost 1&lsqb; to 49, General Electric dipped 1{ to 72{,
Boeing lost 2&lsqb; to 55~ and Upjohn declined 1~ to 41\.
   Student Loan Marketing Association, also knows as Sallie Mae,
fell 4&lsqb; to 49~. A published report said the the nation's largest
loan guarantor for student aid, Higher Education Assistance
Foundation, of which Sallie Mae is a major creditor, may face a
bankruptcy filing. The report stirred concern about debt problems
in the economy.
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric rose 4| to 24&rsqb;. The utility said it was
reviewing a $27 a share tender offer by Kansas City Power &amp; Light.
   Other gainers included precious metals and trucking issues.
   Analysts said the market's inability to break 3,000 _ it twice
closed at 2,999.75 last week _ added to underlying weakness.
   Eugene Peroni, technical research director for Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said after the Dow hit 2,000 in January
1987 ``the market stalled for some time.''
   ``The fact that we were around 3,000 just adds to the
psychological woes at this point and makes it more of a mystical
level,'' he said.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $61.365 billion, or 1.78
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.43 to 194.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 7.90 to 420.79, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 6.30 to 355.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
declined 10.63 to 444.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 354.92, down 5.53.

   Xerox Corp. fired Backer Spielvogel Bates
Worldwide as its U.S. advertising agency and awarded the
multimillion-dollar account to the agency Young &amp; Rubicam, the
office products company announced Monday.
   The company declined to specify how much it spends on domestic
corporate and product advertising, but one source familiar with the
matter said it was about $25 million a year.
   The Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox said the move was part of a
marketing strategy calling for more integration between corporate
and product campaigns around the world.
   Young &amp; Rubicam has been the agency for more than 20 years for
most of the European advertising for Rank Xerox Ltd., a joint
venture in which Xerox owns 51 percent.
   Backer Spielvogel Bates, a New York-based subsidiary of Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi Co. PLC of Great Britain, has handled Xerox corporate and
product advertising in the United States since 1986.
   Xerox said its direct marketing assignments would remain at Lowe
Direct in the United States and Ogilvy &amp; Mather Direct in Europe.
   Backer will continue to work for Xerox for three months, but the
company said Young &amp; Rubicam's work may begin showing up in
September.

<HEAD>No Deal Yet On Eastern; But Rumored Plan Could Split Creditors,
Trustee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SORAGHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines' chairman wants to oversee
a controlled sale of Eastern Airlines' assets and buy many of
Eastern's planes and gates in Atlanta, according to a published
report.
   The story in Monday's editions of The Wall Street Journal said
the proposal was expected to be made Monday, but Eastern said it
had received no offer from Northwest to buy parts of the airline.
   The newspaper reported that Northwest Chairman Alfred A. Checchi
was expected to make the proposal to Eastern and its creditors. The
Journal reported the plan would call for Northwest to take over
certain Eastern assets, including 80 of Eastern's newer aircraft,
airport gates in Atlanta and maintenance facilities in Atlanta and
Miami.
   In return, the story said, Checchi would volunteer to broker a
controlled liquidation of Eastern's remaining assets for the
benefit of creditors.
   The story, which cited unidentified people familiar with the
proposal, said the plan was expected to be offered today.
   Such a proposal could cause a split between creditors and
Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, an analyst said.
   Timothy Pettee, who tracks airlines for Merrill Lynch
Research-U.S., said the reported deal would run against Eastern
trustee Martin Shugrue's plans for keeping the airline together.
But it might find favor with creditors whose main concern is
getting their money back without regard for a future for Eastern,
he said.
   ``It may come down to the creditors having to relieve Mr.
Shugrue of his duties,'' Pettee said in a telephone interview.
   The Journal's story said several difficult issues would have to
be resolved, including what to do about Eastern's financial
liabilities.
   It noted that by some estimates, Eastern's pension plan alone is
underfunded by at least $500 million. Checchi has said he wants no
obligations that would result in additional debt for Northwest.
   Northwest officials declined comment Monday, saying they would
not respond to speculation and rumor.
   In a mid-afternoon release, Eastern said it had received no
offer from Northwest, adding that a breakup of the carrier wasn't
acceptable to Shugrue.
   Guy Cook, president of the Northwest Airlines Machinist's Union,
said he didn't feel that ongoing negotiations were far enough along
for a concrete proposal. Cook said when he heard about the report,
he did some checking and determined that, although Checchi is in
New York, he is not meeting with creditors.
   ``That confirms my belief that no deal is going to be made,''
Cook said.
   But Pettee said, if a deal is made, it would probably cost
Northwest about $500 million dollars.
   ``Northwest does not have debt problems. They are in good
shape,'' he said.
   Helane Becker, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
said the reported proposal would give Northwest a presence in the
Southeast with additional gates in Atlanta as it strives to become
one of the mega-carriers of the 1990's.
   Pettee agreed, saying the Checchi's goal is to shift it's
Southeastern hub out of Memphis, where it's losing money, to
Atlanta.
   ``By moving that plant to Atlanta, he might be able to make some
money,'' Pettee said.
   Eastern is a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. of
Houston, formerly Texas Air Corp. It filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in March
1989, and a bankruptcy judge appointed Shugrue as trustee for the
airline in April.
   Checchi had been a top strategist for the Marriott Corp. hotel
concern and the Bass brothers of Texas before winning a bidding war
last year with a $3.65 billion leveraged buyout proposal for NWA,
the St. Paul, Minn.-based parent of Northwest.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Amerada Hess, Amoco</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil giant Exxon Corp. said Monday its second-quarter profit
soared nearly seven-fold from a year ago, when it set aside a
special provision to handle the massive cleanup from the oil spill
in Valdez, Alaska.
   Meanwhile, Atlantic Richfield Co. reported a 16 percent drop in
quarterly earnings, Amoco reported a 23 percent decline for the
second quarter and Amerada Hess Corp. reported a $72.1 million net
loss. Ashland Oil Inc. said net income for its fiscal third quarter
more than doubled.
   New York-based Exxon earned $1.1 billion, or 87 cents per share,
in the three months ended June 30, compared with earnings of $140
million, or 11 cents a share, in the 1989 quarter. Revenue totaled
$26.08 billion, up 10 percent from $23.61 billion a year ago.
   Last year's results included an $850 million provision for the
Valdez spill. Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990
million, or 78 cents per share, in the 1989 quarter.
   Arco's second-quarter earnings fell to $391 million, or $2.36
per share, from $467 million, or $2.66 a share, in 1989. Sales of
the Los Angeles company fell 7 percent to $4 billion from $4.3
billion.
   Ashland, based in Ashland, Kentucky, reported record net income
of $100 million, or $1.79 a share, for the quarter ended June 30,
1990. The amount was more than double the $44 million, or 78 cents
a share, in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last
year's quarter.

   Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said earnings from petroleum and
natural gas operations increased $205 million, or 22 percent,
despite lower crude prices. He said that helped offset a $115
million drop in chemical earnings.
   Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were
$81 million, down from $29 million in 1989. But earnings from
foreign exploration and production operations rose $75 million to
$464 million.
   From coal and minerals operations, Exxon earned $12 million,
co9mpared with $22 million last year.
   For the first half of 1990, Exxon earned $2.38 billion, or $1.88
per share, up 22 percent from earnings of $1.95 billion in 1989.
Revenue rose 15 percent to $52.0 billion.
   The 1989 results included an $880 million provision related to
the Valdez accident and a $535 million cumulative accounting gain
following adoption of new income tax accounting standards.
   Exxon said it would have earned $2.29 billionn, or $1.79 per
share, in the 1989 half year excluding the provision and special
gain.

   Arco said lower crude oil prices, less production in Alaska and
higher international exploration expenses more than offset a sharp
rise in profits from refining and marketing operations.
   Earnings for the first half of 1990 fell by 16 percent to $983
million, or $5.91 per share, from $1.17 billion, or $6.66 per
share, last year. Six-month revenue fell fractionally to $8.25
billion from $8.30 billion.

<BYLINE>Ashland</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Chairman John R. Hill said the fiscal third-quarter
results were led by growth from Ashland Petroleum Co. and a strong
third quarter from SuperAmerica. Improvement in Ashland's
construction and exploration operations and higher equity income
from coal investments also helped boost earnings, he said.
   Ashland had net income of $123 million, or $2.21 a share, for
the nine months ended June 30, compared to $126 million, or $2.26
per share, last year. Sales totaled $6.5 billion, up from $6.2
billion.

<BYLINE>Amoco</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco posted a $379 million profit, or 75 cents per share, on
revenues of $7.4 billion. In last year's second quarter, Amoco's
profit was $497 million, or 96 cents per share on revenues of $6.8
billion.
   The company blamed the decline partially on the cost of
preparing for possible future environmental cleanup operations and
on unfavorable foreign currency effects, as well as on lower prices
and sales volumes.
   The second quarter earnings for 1990 included a net gain of $471
million related to the settlement of claims arising out of Iran's
seizure of Amoco facilities in that nation during the 1978-79
revolution there, but company officials said that gain was more
than offset by other factors.

   Amerada Hess's net loss of $72.1 million, or 89 cents per share
in this year's second quarter, compares with a profit of $133.5
million, or $1.65 per share, for the second quarter of 1989.
   The New York-based oil company said revenues in the second
quarter of 1990 were $1.233 billion, down from $1.474 billion for
the same period last year.
   Refining and marketing operations lost $44.3 million in the
second quarter, a drop from $125.5 million in earnings for the same
period last year. Capital expenditures were $192.2 million in the
second quarter of the year, up from $177.1 million for the 1989
second quarter.
   For the first six months of the year, the company lost $32.5
million, or 40 cents per share, down from a profit of $353.7
million, or $4.35 per share for the first half of 1989.

<HEAD>AP Computer Problems Cause Incomplete Options Tables</HEAD>

   Computer problems at The Associated Press
resulted in transmission of incomplete stock options tables Monday.
   A problem in computer programs that process incoming trading
data resulted in some transactions being excluded from the tables,
said John Reid, AP vice president and director of communications
and technology.
   It could not be immediately determined how many transactions
were missing, he said.
   The situation was compounded because the tables couldn't be
checked until computers had finished processing them, which took
three hours longer than normal because of the computer glitch.
   Reid said the problem did not affect any other stocks tables
produced by AP.
   The problem was corrected and Tuesday's stock options tables
would be complete, he said.

<HEAD>Schwab Agrees to Fine, Censure in NYSE Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Charles Schwab &amp; Co. Inc. was fined
$375,000 and censured after a New York Stock Exchange investigation
of trading practices by Schwab's Reorganization Department, company
officials announced.
   From January 1985 through September 1988 the department, which
processes tender and exchange offerings, stock purchase rights and
warrants, and convertible redeemable securities, would sometimes
submit more securities than it had instructions from the customer
to tender, according to a company statement issued Monday.
   The trading practices sometimes resulted in gains for Schwab,
the statement said. When gains occurred, Schwab disbursed the
related net credits, with interest, to affected customer accounts.
   The NYSE Hearing Panel found that the department had acted
principally to avoid losses when the firm received and honored late
customer instructions and to protect against errors in complex
junk-bond transactions, according to the statement.
   In addition to the fine, two employees have been censured, the
company said.
   ``We have undertaken strong internal measures to prevent such
practices in the future, including new policies governing each type
of reorganization transaction, separation of functions and a
complete restructuring of the reorganization department,'' said
Charles R. Schwab, founder and chairman.

<HEAD>Turner: TBS Could Lose $26 Million on Goodwill Games</HEAD>

   Ted Turner said Monday that Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. could lose as much as $26 million on the Goodwill Games
_ doubling earlier projections by the company.
   Asked if losses this summer would equal the $26 million
shortfall from the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, the TBS board
chairman said the deficit would be ``in that range.'' He declined
to detail the reasons for the losses at the annual TBS
shareholders' meeting Monday.
   But Turner was upbeat about the international athletic event
that got under way Friday and ends here Aug. 5. He said it is
increasing world exposure for TBS and helping the Atlanta-based
company market its Cable News Network and other services abroad.
   ``We're very happy with the way things are going in the Goodwill
Games,'' Turner said after the session.
   During the meeting, Turner was taken to task for his personal
views by Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog group.
   And a shareholder's proposal to place his frequent companion,
actress Jane Fonda, on the company's board of directors died for
lack of a second.
   The company's 1989 annual report listed $266 million in total
losses from cable network operations, movie and video enterprises,
and two professional sports teams _ the Atlanta Braves baseball and
Atlanta Hawks basketball clubs.
   But Turner told shareholders that ``1989 was the best year that
the company has ever had. We cracked a billion dollars in volume
for the first time.''
   He blamed the losses on costs of refinancing ``junk notes''
issued in conjunction with Turner Broadcasting's purchase of MGM-UA
and said TBS would be within its projected budget for fiscal 1990,
even with the Goodwill losses.
   Turner spent most of the meeting countering jabs from Accuracy
in Media and self-appointed corporate watchdog Evelyn Davis, who
holds stock in 120 corporations. Davis spends much of her time
heckling executives at the companies' annual meetings and also
publishes a newsletter ``Highlights and Lowlights,'' detailing her
opinions about their operations.
   She asked whether TBS was about to merge with any other
companies, and if Turner was going to run for political office.
   Turner responded to both queries with a forceful ``no.''
   Davis offered the proposal to place Ms. Fonda on the 15-member
TBS board of directors.
   ``She is not only a good actress, but above all she is a good
businesswoman, and I think we need a good businesswoman on this
board,'' she said.
   The motion failed.
   Turner had less trouble with AIM, which urged him to retract
``pro-Communist'' statements made on the CNN opinion program
``Crossfire,'' and to ask Ms. Fonda to retract similarly
characterized statements allegedly made in 1968.
   Turner made no apologies for his own statements, though he said
he opposes totalitarian government.
   He promised he would talk to Ms. Fonda.
   AIM alleged that only views shared by Turner _ who holds 62.9
percent of TBS shareholder voting power _ are aired in company
programming.
   Among those mentioned by AIM representatives included his belief
that criminals are products of their environments, that Fidel
Castro is ``a hell of a guy,'' and sympathy should go to those who
pulled the triggers as well as the victims of Tiananmen Square,
Kent State and other tragedies.
