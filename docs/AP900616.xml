   Sen. Dave Durenberger received a warm
welcome home from Republicans meeting at a state convention Friday.
He vowed to survive an ethics investigation into his financial
dealings.
   ``I've got the best friends in all the world,'' Durenberger told
a luncheon of the Independent Republicans, the state party. It was
his first public appearance since the Senate Ethics Committee on
Wednesday completed two days of hearings.
   Durenberger received a standing ovation from the 1,300 luncheon
guests when he entered the banquet room, and another when he
finished his 20-minute speech. Delegates gathered around the
12-year Senate veteran, and handshakes, hugs and kisses were
exchanged.
   ``I'm learning so many lessons these days about how tough times
bring out the best in you and the best in your friends,''
Durenberger said.
   Durengerger said he would not resign.
   ``I just stand on the election results of November 1988,'' he
said. ``This is a six-year term.''
   The Ethics Committee met for two days to investigate allegations
that Durenberger tried to cirumvent Senate limits on speaking fees
and tried to hide his ownership in a Minneapolis condominium to
collect travel reinbursements.
   Durenberger did not refer specifically to the allegations, but
apologized.
   ``I've made mistakes and I'm taking responsibility for every
single one of them,'' he said, adding that he acted in good faith
and did not violate the public trust.
   Durenberger focused his speech on the accomplishments of the
Reagan and Bush administrations and on his work ahead in the
Senate. Durenberger noted that he had been selected as one of seven
Senate conferees to work out differences with the House on the
Clean Air Act.

<HEAD>Water Would Be Shipped by Tanker Under Proposal for Dry Coast
Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge oil tankers steaming along the
Pacific coast from Alaska could be joined next year by ships
carrying water to drought-stricken Southern California, city
officials said Friday.
   Water has become so scarce in Santa Barbara that it's a crime
for a homeowner to hose down his lawn. The gives away low-flow
shower heads and offers $80 each to people who switch from
big-flush to small-flush toilets.
   The water tanker idea is one of three being considered by the
city to ease the drought, said city spokesman Pete Ramsdell.
   The city is negotiating with three companies on a proposal to
import thousands of gallons from Canada. Another idea is to
construct a $50 million desalination plant that would turn sea
water into drinking water, said Ramsdell.
   The city staff will recommend to the City Council on July 31
which idea is worth pursuing further, Ramsdell said.
   Santa Barbara is not connected to either Northern California or
Colorado River supplies and must rely entirely on local sources for
water. Thus it has been the Southern California city hardest hit by
the region's 4-year-old drought.
   City officials made it clear earlier this year they would listen
to just about anyone with an idea on how to get them more water.
   That's where the water tanker idea came in, Ramsdell said.
Proposals rom two Canadian companies and a Santa Barbara firm are
currently being studied.
   Officials of the local company, Sun Belt Water Inc., met with
city officials Friday, said Richard Schuller, the company's
president.
   The company has proposed using tankers to bring in 14,000
acre-feet of water per trip from British Columbia's Toba Inlet.
   Sun Belt's partner in the deal, British Columbia-based water
bottler Snowcap Ltd., is one of several companies already licensed
by the Canadian province to export fresh water.
   Ramsdell said the city, which used about 16,000 acre-feet of
water a year before the drought, wants to import at least 5,000
acre-feet a year of water.
   Schuller, noting his company proposed bringing in far more than
that, said the rest could be sold to other water users in Santa
Barbara County.
   Schuller said his company made an initial bid of $2,700 per
acre-foot. The costs would cover installing terminals in Canada and
California for drawing and unloading the water, he said.
   ``We would own the facilities and operate the ships,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Communist spies are coming in from the
cold throughout Germany, and officials are trying to lure others
from possible Soviet recruitment with suggestions of amnesty.
   For 40 years, East German agents using West Germany as their
Western base stole vital defense and technological secrets, wrecked
one West German government and turned the German states into the
espionage battleground of the Cold War.
   With the collapse of the East German Communist government and
the rapidly approaching merger of the two Germanys, officials say
the former adversaries are cooperating. In addition, many former
spooks are talking, some in hopes of bettering their fate in a
unified Germany.
   ``As you can imagine, the information flows quite freely because
we have former Stasi officials who come to us and speak very
frankly and freely,'' said Lutz Stavenhagen, a security expert in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
   Stasi in German is short for the old East German Ministry for
State Security, which included domestic and foreign intelligence
agents.
   West German espionage experts estimate there are up to 6,000
spies in West Germany, including East German agents and West German
defectors, but they won't say how many are known to authorities.
   The treaty that outlines the conditions for the economic and
social unification of the two German states does not address the
espionage issue.
   What to do with the spies has become ``a very, very tricky
matter,'' said one West German government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   An amnesty has been suggested.
   ``They must think about it, because (otherwise) there would be
too many people at risk to be punished on both sides of the former
German border,'' said Hans-Gert Lange, spokesman for the Federal
Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
   Adding impetus to an amnesty proposal is the fear the Soviets
are recruiting agents.
   ``We know that obviously the Soviet secret service, the KGB, is
trying to get hold of the most efficient of these agents,''
Stavenhagen said in an interview Wednesday.
   He said officials have tried to counter that by urging them to
turn themselves in to avoid persecution.
   A similar situation developed after World War II, as both the
Soviets and Western allies scrambled to recruit the top agents who
had worked in Hitler's secret service.
   Stavenhagen said the most likely outcome for agents in West
Germany would be an ``amnesty for the normal spy _ looking into
boxes and papers and that sort of thing,'' but the ``basic
condition is that they turn themselves over.''
   Top spies, ones the West Germans say ``have blood on their
hands,'' would not qualify for an amnesty, he said.
   A different amnesty _ perhaps one without conditions _ would
probably apply to the spies in East Germany who worked for the
branch of Stasi that spied on the West. One West German government
espionage expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated
there were about 12,000 such spies.
   ``It's bad enough, but what can you do? At the time they did it,
they didn't do something illegal according to GDR (East German)
laws,'' Stavenhagen said.
   Two top targets in East Germany are Markus Wolf, former head of
East German espionage, and former senior West German
counterintelligence official Hans-Joachim Tiedge, who fled to the
East with vital secrets. Stavenhagen said they probably would not
qualify for amnesty.
   West German officials have alleged in the last several weeks
that Wolf is helping the KGB set up a new spy network, a charge he
denies.
   In an interview with Junge Welt, the East German youth
newspaper, Wolf termed as ``absolute nonsense'' speculation that
the KGB had taken over complete groups of former East German spies.
However, in another interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, he
said he could not rule out the possibility that individual spies
had gone over to Moscow of their own will.
   A decision on how to handle the spies is expected before formal
German unification, which Stavenhagen estimated would be before
year's end.
   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a decision could be ready in two weeks, but that because of
the sensitivity of the issue, it probably would not be announced
until a majority of the governing coalition was assured.
   In the meantime, the two German interior ministers ``are in very
close cooperation,'' Stavenhagen said.
   ``From the eastern part of Germany, a substantial number (of
spies) have come here ... and we have very valuable information
from them, so those still hiding hoping that they wouldn't be
detected, I think are doing the wrong thing.''

<HEAD>Long-Neglected Miners Play New Role as Shock Troops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners, among the most outspoken
critics of the former Communist rulers, have become the shock
troops of President-elect Ion Iliescu during anti-government
protests.
   Neglected during more than four decades of Communist rule, the
miners have enjoyed the biggest rewards of the December revolution
that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu: higher salaries, more food
and less work.
   Though their presence in the pits is vital to the country's
growing energy needs, Iliescu and his ruling National Salvation
Front have called miners to Bucharest three times since the
revolution to act against government opponents.
   While Iliescu has pledged to move Romania toward a free-market
pluralistic society, he has relied on the tactics of the former
hard-line Communists rather than Western standards of democratic
dialogue to deal with protest.
   ``Traditionally, when Communist bosses thought their political
fate was in danger, they asked the workers to come and help them,''
said Stelian Tanase, editor of the anti-Communist weekly ``22.''
   ``Now, the neo-Communists largely making up the Front are
appealing to the miners, viewed as the workers' advance guard, who
received everything they wanted from the government,'' Tanase said.
   In a controlled Communist society, the shows of support posed
little danger, but relying on such tactics during a turbulent
post-revolutionary period has proved bloody and destabilizing,
observers said.
   ``Iliescu's game is a very dangerous one. Using the miners
against other civilian groups, such as students and intellectuals,
can lead to unforeseen consequences,''said Emil Hurezeanu, a
Romanian exile and editor at Munich-based Radio Free Europe.
   ``Iliescu still thinks as a Communist. People like him, who have
been trained as Communists since childhood, cannot discard the mold
too easily,'' wrote Vladimir Tismaneanu, a professor of Romanian
stock who lives in Philadelphia, in the independent newspaper
Romania Libera.
   Until the December revolution that deposed and executed former
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's 70,000 miners
worked more and received less pay and food than their Soviet bloc
colleagues.
   Most work in mountainous western Transylvania, dominated the
largest coal basin of the Jiu Valley, where 30,000 coal miners went
on strike in 1977 demanding a five-day week, six-hour day, free hot
meal and retirement at 50.
   Ceausescu, taken aback by the biggest work protest in Communist
Romania, initially gave in, but later rescinded most concessions.
The now disbanded secret police arrested hundreds of miners, and
their leaders disappeared.
   The Front, a loose organization of ex-Communists, technocrats
and industrial workers, set to improving the living standard of
workers _ especially the vocal miners _ shortly after taking power
in the revoution.
   In January, Iliescu, 60, a former Communist Party secretary, met
miners' leaders and agreed to their demands, adding alpine chalets
as a bonus.
   According to some Romanians, Iliescu's aim was primarily to
appease miners, but they said that at the same time, he may have
realized he could manipulate them to the Front's advantage.
   Days later, Iliescu made a televised appeal for their support to
counter a major anti-government demonstration. Thousands of miners
arrived in Bucharest and attacked an opposition party headquarters.
Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasants Party, had to
be rescued by an armored personnel carrier.
   On Feb. 19, a day after opposition demonstrators stormed and
ransacked government headquarters, 5,000 miners came to Bucharest
again to show support for the Front. They warned they would return
in case of further trouble.
   Early Thursday, thousands of miners poured into Bucharest at the
government's request after anti-government demonstrators stormed
and set fire to police and Interior Ministry buildings.
   The violence started early Wednesday when club-wielding police
routed anti-Communist demonstrators who had blocked University
Square for 53 days.
   Operating as vigilantes or paramilitary groups, the helmeted
miners, their faces smudged with coal dust, stopped cars, checked
identities, made home searches, confiscated or destroyed property
and clubbed anyone they wanted.
   ``It's clear that they had all the logistical support provided
by the government,'' a Western analyst said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They came on buses or trains from as far away as Maramures,
300 miles northwest of Bucharest, and in the capital they were
given food and milk from army trucks. The whole thing was well
organized,'' the analyst said.

   A snow surfer who made pioneering
descents in the Himalayas and the Alps was killed while trying to
conquer a steep slope on Mont Blanc, police said.
   Bruno Gouvy, 27, skidded on an ice patch shortly after being
dropped by helicopter Friday on the top of the Green Needle, a
13,523-foot peak on Mont Blanc in the French Alps, police said.
   As those aboard the helicopter, including a film crew, looked
on, Gouvy skidded more than 3,000 feet down a steep face before
falling into a crevasse.
   Snow surfing, an increasingly popular sport, is a form of skiing
on a single board, positioned like a surfer. Ski poles are not used.
   Gouvy reportedly held the altitude record for his sport with a
1989 descent on Mount Everest starting at 27,650 feet.
   Gouvy, who last year snow-surfed down the west face of the Eiger
in the Swiss Alps, also was an experienced mountain climber and a
devotee of free-fall parachuting.

   Viorel Budulacu, beaten up during a
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations, says he suffered more
than cuts and bruises. He also lost his idealism.
   ``The only chance is to defect _ flee from Romania,'' said the
25-year-old student.
   Like many students who helped spearhead the December revolution
that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu, Budulacu said he has lost faith in
President-elect Ion Iliescu.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front won the May 20
elections but the protesters say they are continuing Ceausescu's
repressive policies.
   Budulacu, a sophomore at Bucharest Polytechnic, was one of 367
people hurt since police broke up a 53-day-old peaceful
anti-Communist protest at downtown University Square on Wednesday.
   That action touched off fierce street violence that claimed five
lives when security forces opened fire on crowds attacking them.
   Iliescu called for help in quelling the anti-government
demonstrations, and thousands of coal miners responded by pouring
into the capital and brutally beating anyone they suspected of
being an opponent of the government.
   Marius Dinu, 22, an architecture student and University Square
protester, told reporters at the Emergency Hospital on Friday he
has no hope left for Romania.
   ``I don't know what's awaiting me. I would like to leave the
country for good ... and forget all about the hopes the revolution
has given me,'' Dinu said.
   Dinu was hospitalized after being clubbed, punched and kicked by
miners Thursday morning in the School of Architecture on the square.
   ``They threw us on top of each other into a moaning pile,'' he
said.
   Emergency Hospital director Mihai Ciuta told a news conference
Friday that 48 of the 236 injured people treated at his facility
since Wednesday morning remained hospitalized, most with multiple
injuries.
   Marian Munteanu, president of the Students' League and one of
the leaders of the anti-government protest, has a fractured skull
and broken left leg and arm, Dr. Horia Georgescu said.
   Munteaunu, speaking from the emergency ward, said he believed
Iliescu's rule was doomed to fail.
   ``I wouldn't like to be in Iliescu's place. I believe in God and
one day we will all have to answer God's questions for whatever we
have done,'' he said.
   ``It's a long way to democracy,'' said Munteaunu, close to
tears. ``You are now watching a growing dictator.''
   Iliescu was shown on state television Friday night thanking the
miners ``with all my heart'' for defending his government.
   Marius Dobrescu, beaten by paramilitary police when he and other
demonstrators stormed the state television building, is now in
intensive care. He said he also wants to leave Romania.
   ``I am sorry I survived Ceausescu's times and I find myself
wanting to leave the country again,'' Dobrescu said.

   Israel is fast running out of housing for
Soviet Jews, and the country could face a severe shortage by year's
end.
   Government officials say more than 43,000 Soviet Jews have
arrived this year, and the influx has pushed up rents in some
areas, fueling protests by young Israelis that they are being
priced out of the housing market.
   ``If something isn't done soon, we are going to have a social
explosion,'' warned Jerusalem's deputy mayor, Avraham Kehila.
   The emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel has been running at
record levels since Moscow relaxed exit policies in the spring of
1989, and the United States subsequently tightened its immigration
rules.
   Nearly 13,000 Soviets came to Israel in 1989. The 1990 total is
expected to exceed 150,000, Israeli officials say.
   Uri Shoshani, director of engineering and planning in the
Housing Ministry, said Israel's estimated 20,000 vacant rental
units will be filled in four months.
   Three months later, Israel will have exhausted it's supply of
``alternate'' housing, such as holiday flats, army camps and
off-season hotel rooms, he said.
   He said the ministry has asked that 60,000 new units be built
this year, or three times the rate of recent years.
   But so far, ground has been broken for only 7,000 new homes,
Shoshani said. ``We're building as fast as we can but we're worried
that there just won't be enough housing to go around,'' Shoshani
said.
   The shortage already is apparent in the modest-priced units that
Soviet immigrant families can afford on government housing
subsidies of $237 monthly.
   A recent survey by the Hebrew daily Hadashot showed rental
prices had risen significantly. In suburban Nazareth, monthly rents
for two-bedroom units have risen from $80 to $200 in the past year,
Hadashot said. In Rishon Lezion near Tel Aviv, rents have doubled
to $600, and in Jerusalem they are up 150 percent to $450, the
paper said.
   The increase has come about because landlords have raised rents
on the cheapest apartments to match the Soviets' monthly subsidy.
That drives up rents all down the line.
   In Israel, the average monthly after-tax income for a family of
four is $1,160. Many young Israelis say they cannot compete with
Soviets for housing and they have begun forming protest groups to
seek government help.
   In Beersheva in the southern Negev desert, scores of university
students, young couples and recently discharged soldiers staged a
sit-down protest to demand affordable housing. They have formed a
group called ``Young People Without Apartments'' to press their
concerns.
   Rafi Luzan, a 36-year-old factory worker, from Carmiel near
Haifa, went on a hunger strike earlier this month after his rent
was raised to $300 from $150. He was forced to move out of his flat
with his wife and their son.
   Luzan, who earns $650 a month, is encouraging people thrown out
of their homes to live in tents outside Carmiel's municipal
building until their plight is resolved.
   ``Rents have doubled all over town, and working people and young
couples don't have the money to pay for it,'' Luzan told Israel
radio.
   Hana Koval, spokeswoman for the Carmiel government, warned of
``a social catastrophe'' if emergency measures aren't taken soon.
   She said Carmiel officials wanted the Israeli government to buy
up unsold houses and apartments and rent them at subsidized rates
to Israelis. Town officials also have called for rent controls.

   An archaeological team is sifting through
a Sierra Nevada campsite for remnants from the final days of George
and Jacob Donner, whose dreams of life in sunny California ended
near here in icy disaster.
   The two brothers from Illinois and most of their party died 144
years ago when a raging October snowstorm halted their westward
trek and sealed their fate.
   Donald Hardesty, an archaeologist at the University of Nevada,
Reno, is leading a team of students and volunteers in an effort to
pinpoint the exact whereabouts of the brothers' last camp at Alder
Creek.
   ``This camp is not nearly as well known or understood through
written accounts,'' he said Thursday.
   The Donner families stopped at Alder Creek when a wagon axle
broke. The rest of the party continued to a lake about five miles
away, now known as Donner Lake.
   Incessant snow trapped both groups for six months in 1846-1847.
As starvation set in, they ate boiled hides for nourishment. When
those were gone, they turned to the flesh of their comrades who
died of weakness.
   Of the 87 people who became stranded, 39 survived. Nine of the
12 adults and nine children with the Donner families lived to see
the spring. The Donner brothers did not.
   Hardesty said it is believed George Donner used tree limbs
propped against a giant Ponderosa Pine that still towers over the
site, and covered them with animal hides and quilts for a shelter.
Jacob Donner created a similar lean-to for his family about 200
yards away.
   Hardesty hopes to uncover the location of a third camp believed
to have been used by teamsters traveling with the families.
   Armed with buckets, brushes, trowels and sifters, 19 students
and 10 volunteers sifted the soil near the two sites on Thursday in
the joint venture of the university and the U.S. Forest Service.
   As the excavating team worked in the warm June sunshine, yellow
and purple wildflowers bloomed in a nearby meadow and the sweet
scent of sagebrush perfumed the air. But almost as a reminder of
the task, gray clouds hugged the snowcapped peaks of the Sierra.
   Hardesty said the group hopes to find small items and fragments
at Alder Creek.
   He said diaries were kept by those at the Donner Lake cabins,
but no writings have been found near the Alder Creek site.
   Hardesty participated in a 1984 excavation of the Donner Lake
site, where bone fragments, cloth remnants, chips of pottery and
hardware were uncovered. The most significant find there, he said,
was a bronze, Roman Catholic medallion.

   An appeals court reversed convictions for
murder and manslaughter stemming from a 1987 slaying because jurors
visited the crime site on their own to assess the evidence.
   ``Unauthorized visits to the crime scene are condemned,'' the
1st District Court of Appeal said in a ruling released Friday. The
state court, in a 3-0 decision, said the observations by two jurors
contradicted important defense testimony in the case.
   The court granted a new trial to Dana Deweese of Castro Valley
and his sister, Deanna Joao. Joao's lawyer, Kyle Gee, said she
already has served most of her four-year sentence for manslaughter.
Deweese was sentenced to 17 years to life for second-degree murder.
   They were convicted of the August 1987 killing of Kenneth Tyrone
Jackson after a brawl between the Deweeses and a neighbor family at
a birthday party.
   Prosecution witnesses said Jackson was not holding a weapon or
making threatening gestures when Deweese, standing 15 to 20 feet
away, shot him with a gun his sister allegedly had given him. They
said Deweese was standing between his brother Duane and Jackson.
   But Deweese testified that Jackson was pointing a knife at
Duane, five or six feet away, and attempting to stab him when
Deweese fired into the ground to scare Jackson. He said the gun
accidentally went off a second time and hit Jackson, about 40 feet
away.
   After the verdict, two jurors, Margaret Westberg and Daniel
Freeman, told a defense investigator they had visited the site
during the trial. Freeman said he had concluded that Deweese had
been less than 25 feet from Jackson.
   Freeman's unauthorized observations contradicted Deweese's
testimony, supported prosecution testimony that Deweese's brother
was not in danger, and caused the juror to question Deweese's
credibility, said the opinion by Presiding Justice Harry Low.
   ``By wrongly viewing the crime scene, the juror was improperly
influenced against defendant's version of the shooting,'' Low said.
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde ruled that the
declarations did not require a new trial, but was overruled by the
appeals court.

<HEAD>Hole Swallows City's Water Supply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a million people have been asked
to conserve water after farmers failed to block a hole in a canal
that supplies Bristol and surrounding communities.
   A culvert collapsed Thursday night beneath the Gloucester and
Sharpness canal north of this city of about 375,000, located about
100 miles west of London.
   Farmers threw straw bales, barrels and an old farm gate wrapped
in plastic into the whirlpool created by water rushing through the
hole, but could not stem the leak.
   The collapse of the culvert allowed more than a million gallons
of water to escape.
   ``It was like a bath without the plug in, but on an enormous
scale,'' said Jeremy Williams, spokesman for the Bristol Water
Company.
   The 18-mile canal carries more than 30 million gallons of water
a day to serve an area around Bristol of more than 1,000 square
miles. The leak reduced the water supply by two-thirds, Williams
said.
   ``We do not yet know what caused the collapse, but the culvert
is 170 years old and it might have just given up,'' Williams said,
adding that repairs were expected to take a week.
   About a million customers were asked to conserve water while
supplies from reservoirs in the Mendip hills were pumped in.

   Sveta and Oleg have signed up to marry. But they
won't be around to hear the wedding bells _ they'll be too busy
shopping.
   In an illustration of how desperate Soviets are for food and
consumer goods, Sveta and Oleg have applied to marry just to get
the right to shop in a special store for brides and grooms.
   When they applied, wedded bliss was the furthest thing from
their minds, although the couple is in love and living together.
Oleg's thoughts were on an imported man's suit, cuff links, gold or
silver wedding rings and imported shoes; Sveta's were on her own
ring, imported shoes, pantyhose and mascara.
   For both, it was a chance to shop in Gemini, part of a
nationwide chain of stores that is an oasis in a desert of deficits.
   Here is how the scam works: a single or divorced Soviet finds a
partner and applies to marry at a government registration office.
They pay a 15-ruble ($24) fee. The couple is assigned a date for an
official ceremony and is given a prized booklet of coupons for the
Gemini store, as well as food shops meant to supply wedding parties.
   The couple can shop at the stores until the wedding day, when
the coupons expire. They don't show up for the official wedding,
and their marriage application is automatically voided.
   Then they can start all over again. And if their faces become
too familiar at the registration office, they can just go to
another.
   That's why Sveta and Oleg have no intention of getting married.
   The scam is so lucrative that Sveta has applied to marry three
times since November _ once with Oleg, twice with his friends.
   Thousands are participating. One-third of all Soviets applying
to marry do so only so they can shop in the special stores, state
television's breakfast show ``120 Minutes'' reported in April.
   And that does not include other matches that are made merely so
one partner can obtain a residence permit in a city where the other
lives.
   Looking for loopholes, even in such a sacred institution as
marriage, has become a survival technique in a system that has
failed to offer Soviets the food and consumer goods they want.
   ``It's the situation in this state which leads people to such
things, where you can't spend money on anything except low-quality
food,'' said Viktor, a 31-year-old Muscovite. Like Oleg, Viktor
applied to marry a friend of his girlfriend in May so they could
obtain access to the special store.
   ``There's such a terrible deficit. You can't buy anything in the
(regular) stores,'' said Sveta, a 28-year-old eye doctor. She
declined to give her surname, fearing its publication would help
authorities track her down.
   The fear was largely unfounded, because what she and the
thousands of other Soviets are doing is not illegal.
   ``It's a moral, not a legal issue,'' said Valentina Borzhenkova,
director of Moscow's Wedding Palace No. 1, where weddings are
performed. ``It's everyone's right if all formalities are
followed.''
   ``If all the offices had computers, this couldn't happen,
because they could check whether you have applied at more than
one,'' Sveta said. But computers are as rare as efficient
bureaucrats in the Soviet government, so couples can apply as often
as they like.
   The bureaucrats admit they are powerless to end the practice.
   ``It will stop only when there are no deficits in the country,''
Mrs. Borzhenkova said.
   At the Gemini store, Sveta has bought American shoes _ virtually
unavailable elsewhere in the Soviet Union _ and gold rings. She
travels to a nearby socialist country and and resells the rings _
at a hefty profit. Other goods also have a handsome return.
Imported women's shoes bought at Gemini for 55 rubles ($89) can be
peddled on the black market for 150 rubles ($243), she said.
   The special stores, however, are not a completely reliable
source. Perhaps because of the high number of fictitious marriages,
even the special stores have sporadic supplies and long lines _
sometimes a six hour-wait.
   ``If you want everything, you must go every day and still
there's no guarantee you'll get everything you want,'' Sveta said.
   One day this month, Gemini, where only customers holding a
coupon booklet are admitted, was selling 400-ruble ($648) gold
rings and 55-ruble ($89) women's shoes from Yugoslavia and Hungary.
   Aside from its treasure trove of goods, the store is set apart
in other ways. It is well lit, clean and colorful, with decorations
in a celestial theme.
   But there is an even better shop nearby, for couples celebrating
their 25th and 50th anniversaries. Sveta would love to get into
that one, but admits with a laugh, ``Unfortunately, grandmothers
and grandfathers won't run back and forth to the registration
offices.''

<HEAD>Bush Vetoes Easing of Rules on Federal Workers Politicking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said he must ensure the
``integrity of the civil service'' as he vetoed a bill relaxing
51-year-old curbs on the off-duty political activity of government
workers.
   Two days after the Senate upheld his 11th veto, an authorization
bill for Amtrak, Bush cast the 12th veto of his presidency. No Bush
veto has yet been overturned.
   ``The Hatch Act has upheld the integrity of the civil service by
assuring that federal employees are hired and promoted based upon
their qualifications and not their political loyalties,'' he said
Friday in a veto message to Congress.
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, representing federal employees in 16 agencies and
departments, called the veto ``wrongheaded'' and urged the Senate
to override it.
   Tobias urged lawmakers to ``hold fast to their commitment to
federal workers.''
   He said in a statement, ``Senators must maintain their
courageous support of reform and not trade their collective
conscience for White House cuff links or breakfast with Bush.''
   Republican leaders have said they expect to be able to sustain
the veto, even though the bill passed by more than the two-thirds
majorities that would be needed to override.
   The Hatch Act revision would affect 3 million federal employees
and postal workers, who are now prohibited from participating in
any form of political activity beyond voting.
   Sent to Bush by a 334-87 House vote on Wednesday, the bill would
allow government employees to work in political campaigns on their
own time, hold office in a political party and attend political
conventions.
   However, the measure would leave intact prohibitions against
running for partisan political office and soliciting money from the
public.
   Sponsors said the measure would extend some of the same
fundamental freedoms now enjoyed by most Americans to federal and
postal workers.
   But Bush said he was opposed to any tinkering with the Hatch
Act, passed in 1939 to prevent Depression-era government workers
from being pressured to work for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
re-election effort.
   Bush said the easing would ``inevitably lead to
re-politicizing'' the government bureaucracy.
   ``It has been manifestly successful over the years in shielding
civil servants and the programs they administer from political
exploitation and abuse,'' Bush wrote.
   ``We cannot afford, in the final decade of this century, to
embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of public
administration from the last century,'' he said.
   The Senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 67-30.
That would be just enough for a veto override. But GOP Senate
leaders have expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of
their colleagues to change votes.
   In sending the bill back to Congress with a veto, Bush told
lawmakers: ``As one who has devoted much of his life to public
service, I take great pride in the integrity of our federal work
force.''

   The pet product industry's annual trade show is
not a place dogs would find rough, rough, rough.
   It's a world where dogs strut in T-shirts and neon sun visors,
fish live in designer aquariums and birds eat from National
Football League helmet feeders.
   The 485 booths at the American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association show have such standard fare as pet foods, Kitty Litter
and bird cages, but also offbeat items.
   There is a full line of NFL-licensed items that identify pets
with their favorite team _ or at least the team of their owner.
   ``It's important to get kids and adults to think about their
pets and bring them into the family, not just look at them as
disposable things,'' said Karen Long MacLeod, editor of the trade
publication Pet Age. ``Those products are designed to keep pets
healthy and to have fun.''
   Anne McDowell, senior licensing manager for NFL Properties Inc.,
said the idea for the NFL pet products came from a dinner party
attended by a league official in Pittsburgh, where the hosts had
knit a Steelers sweater for their dog.
   When the NFL decided to sanction pet products bearing team
logos, Ms. McDowell said, ``We decided, don't do it piecemeal. Go
all the way. Let's do everything.''
   Animal T-shirts, sweaters, dinner bowls, beds, collars and bird
feeders all bear NFL insignias.
   There's a variety pack of rawhide chews in the shapes of
helmets, footballs, jerseys and pennants.
   The three-day show was ending today.

   Robert Polhill, who had to treat his own diabetes
as a hostage in Lebanon, and former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
were honored by the American Diabetes Association.
   Polhill, an American University professor whom Shiite Moslem
kidnappers held 39 months, was presented Friday with an American
Diabetes Association Honor recognizing his perseverance and heroism.
   He was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx after being freed in
April and had his vocal cords removed. He stood by as his wife,
Ferial, read his remarks to the ADA's national convention.
   ``If there is any achievement to be honored ... most of the
credit must go to that remarkable piece of equipment called the
human body, which with a little help from the human spirit, can
adjust to and overcome even the most burdensome adversities,'' he
said.
   Koop said people should learn to depend more on themselves,
preventing disease through diet and exercise. The ADA's Koop Medal
will be presented each year for contributions to public health.

   Entertainer Cher returned to the Las Vegas
stage after an eight-year absence, giving a pop-metal review to a
sold-out crowd at a Strip resort.
   ``This is going to be a very strange show for a lot of you,''
she said early in her hourlong performance in the 1,500-seat
showroom at the new Mirage Hotel and Casino.
   Cher opened the show wearing slacks, a blouse and a vest. She
promised the crowd it would be the most attire she would wear the
rest of the evening, and made good on the promise when she returned
later in a black lace body suit.
   She will perform eight shows during a six-night engagement that
began Thursday.
   Cher and her former husband, Sonny Bono, first appeared in Las
Vegas in 1969, polishing an act they would take on television in
1971. The two played Las Vegas, apart and together, through 1982.

   Singer Miriam Makeba wants to
sing before her native South African people but says there's a
question about whether that would amount to the long-exiled
performer breaking a boycott.
   She indicated some disagreement with the African National
Congress and others who advocate the boycott. ``I believe as a
South African the cultural boycott does not apply to me,'' she said
Friday.
   ``It would be a shame for me to die tomorrow before I come back
to sing before you, because that is something I look forward to the
most, to come back and sing before the South African people, where
I do not have to translate my songs,'' she said.
   She left South Africa in 1959 at age 27 to make a movie musical
and appear on television in the United States, but received a
one-year contract to sing at the Village Vanguard in New York. When
her mother died in 1960, the year the African National Congress was
outlawed, Ms. Makeba was denied permission to return home and
attend the funeral.
   After landing in Johannesburg on a flight from her home in
Brussels, Belgium, last Sunday, Ms. Makeba went immediately to her
mother's grave in Soweto. ``I tried to make a prayer. I just
choked, and all I did was weep,'' she said at a news conference.

   The name was familiar, but seemingly out of

Angeles Times under the byline of Henry Kissinger.
   Actually, it wasn't the first time the former secretary of state
had undertaken such an endeavor, and it won't be the last _
Kissinger and Times senior correspondent Anthony Day are teaming up
on five World Cup columns during this year's competition in Italy.
   Last Sunday's column previewed the competition. The next column
will appear June 24 and three will follow on consecutive Sundays.
   ``Henry and I are going to meet up in Italy on June 26 and stay
there for the rest of the World Cup,'' Day said Friday.
   Day, 57, admitted he knows a lot less about soccer than the
67-year-old Kissinger, who's the vice chairman of the World Cup '94
Organizing Committee. The 1994 World Cup will be hosted by the
United States.
   ``He's been a soccer fan since he was a boy in Germany,'' Day

<HEAD>Bush Now Supports International Fund to Phase Out CFCs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush no longer opposes an
international fund to help poor nations phase out ozone-depleting
chemicals and is joining other world leaders in calling for such
action, the White House says.
   The Bush administration is willing to contribute $25 million to
a fund expected to total about $100 million over three years, said
one administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. No
figures were officially released in Friday's announcement that the
administration will push for a fund.
   In the policy reversal, the White House announced it will
propose establishing a fund to help Third World countries at an
international meeting next week in London.
   U.S. opposition to the fund had threatened to disrupt the
conference, where participating nations will consider changes to
strengthen the 1987 so-called Montreal Protocol to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the turn of the century.
   U.S. officials recognized that failing to help the developing
nations _ particularly heavy CFC producers such as China and India
_ would alienate them and keep them from signing the pending update
of the Montreal Protocol, said the administration source.
   The White House announcement brought praise from Capitol Hill.
   The ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, said it was
``tremendously good news'' coming as it does ``on the eve of the
London meeting.''
   A Democratic critic of Bush's environmental policies, Sen. Al
Gore of Tennessee, said the decision was ``predictable because the
original policy was completely out of touch with the reality.''
   He said the United States was ``the last holdout'' among
nations. ``Instead of providing leadership they try to block any
progress, then begrudgingly admit the obvious,'' he said.
   Before Friday's announcement, the administration had maintained
that any assistance to Third World nations for phasing out CFCs
should come from existing World Bank resources and not new funds.
But World Bank officials said it could not afford such a program.
   White House spokesman Steve Hart said a key to the policy change
was that the administration's plan calls for a new fund, but within
the existing World Bank structure, rather than setting up a
completely new organization to administer the fund.
   Earlier this week, Mustafa K. Tolba of Egypt, head of the U.N.
Environment Program, said U.S. opposition to the financial aid fund
suggested by a number of European countries last month threatened
to unravel the Montreal Protocol. The treaty calls for reducing CFC
production by 50 percent by the end of the century. The pending
amendments would call for complete phase-out by that time.
   CFCs, used widely as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants,
are depleting the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from
harmful levels of ultraviolet rays, scientists say.
   Hart said internal discussion among administration officials,
with input from other governments, led to the switch in policy.
   ``We have found that we're at a point ... where we feel such a
fund is warranted,'' he said.
   One country pressuring the United States to change its stance
was Britain, said an administration source.
   Specifics of the plan, such as how the aid would be
disseminated, were to be worked out in the London negotiations.
   U.S. officials are expected to push for a system under which the
largest contributors would have the most say in where the money
goes.
   A World Bank official hailed the White House announcement as
``the beginning of a chance for real dialogue'' on the CFC question.
   The White House statement was put out under the name of Chief of
Staff John Sununu, who has been criticized by environmentalists for
blocking other environmental initiatives. Activists have criticized
the administration for what they call foot-dragging on eliminating
CFCs.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is attempting to
ease the strain in U.S.-Israeli relations by promising that America
will continue to support its ally's military edge in the volatile
Middle East.
   But Cheney also cautioned that U.S.-supplied weaponry won't
ensure Israel's security unless ``successful negotiations'' with
Palestinians and Arab states take place.
   Cheney, speaking Friday before the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith in New York City, stressed America's commitment to
peace in the Mideast as well as its ``solid and unalterable'' ties
to Israel.
   The secretary also made a point of congratulating the new
government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saying the
administration looks forward ``to working with him to secure a
comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between
Israel and all of its Arab neighbors.''
   The secretary's remarks were monitored by reporters in the
Pentagon.
   Cheney made no direct mention of the sharp remarks exchanged in
recent days between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Shamir over Israel's commitment to the peace process.
   But he did note that all is not well between the two allies.
``The important thing in a good relationship is to remember that
disagreements are not all there is,'' he said.
   Cheney said that while both nations have ``had our differences
of opinion'' about how best to pursue the peace process, ``there is
not an ally in the world with whom we have not had an occasional
disagreement.''
   Strategic cooperation between the two nations has ``become
closer than ever'' and Israel is in line to receive 35 percent of
the administration's fiscal 1991 budget request for security
assistance, Cheney said.
   Israel is to begin taking delivery on its third order of F-16
fighter jets next year, will be getting its first delivery of
Apache attack helicopters and is getting funds to upgrade its navy,
the secretary added.
   Israel has received around $3.1 billion a year in a combination
of military and economic aid from the United States.
   Cheney advised, however, that such aid is not the path to peace
in the volatile Mideast.
   ``Israel must remain strong to secure that peace, but weapons
and technology alone are not sufficient,'' Cheney said. ``Real
security can only come through successful negotiations with
Palestinians and Arab states that leads to a durable peace.''
   Cheney also put in a plug for his defense budget request, saying
that the U.S. commitment to Israel's security ``depends on our
ability to project American power.''
   Even though budgets are shrinking, the United States must
continue to fund a highly trained, mobile and lethal fighting force
to protect its interests around the world, he argued.
   ``Some people who like to portray themselves as great friends of
Israel are also in the forefront of those who want to cut the heart
out of the defense budget,'' Cheney said. ``I believe those two
positions are fundamentally incompatible. We in the United States
must not let ourselves become just another regional power. If we
do, we _ and our friends, such as Israel _ may well suffer the
consequences.''
   Baker, testifying before a Senate committee on Wednesday, urged
Israel's new right-wing government to move to restart the stalled
peace process.
   He sarcastically recited the telephone number of the White House
switchboard and said: ``When you're serious about peace, call us.''
   In return, Shamir blamed U.S. criticism of Israel for stirring
up growing Arab hostility toward the Jewish state.
   ``Aggressive intentions ... begin to surface in the Arab world
as soon as they see cracks or breaches in the wall of friendship
between Israel and the United States,'' Shamir said in an interview
published Friday in the Jerusalem Post.

   A pair of 12-year-old boys weren't
playing cops and robbers when they allegedly tried to hold up a
credit union office by pretending to have a gun, police said.
   The pre-teens entered the Marathon-Republic Credit Union office
Thursday and one told manager Judy Boles that he had a gun under
his shirt, police investigator Leo Rodriguez said.
   ``He said, `Lady, I ain't playing with you. I have a gun, this

   The boys ran off when Ms. Boles said she doubted that he had a
gun.
   Police arrested the two 12-year-olds and a 9-year-old boy about
30 minutes later. The younger boy allegedly acted as lookout.
   The 9-year-old was released because he is too young to
prosecute. The other boys were being held in a juvenile detention
center.
   ``Both said they were only pretending they were going to hold up
the place,'' Rodriguez said. ``They were taken seriously and now
they're in serious trouble.''

   The United States will hold back any economic
aid to Romania, where miners backing the government beat up
journalists and raided the offices of opposition parties.
   The State Department, in a statement read by spokesman Richard
Boucher, also said an envoy would go to Bucharest to express
American concern to the Romanian government.
   The statement urged Romanian President-elect Ion Iliescu to
``clear all worker vigilantes from the streets and publicly pledge
that they will not be encouraged or allowed to re-enter.''
   ``The actions authorized by President Iliescu and his government
in the past few days strike at the very heart of Romanian
democracy,'' Boucher said.
   Miners poured into the Romanian capital on Thursday after
Iliescu called for their help to put down what he called fascist
forces demonstrating against his government. The miners beat
pedestrians and journalists and raided the offices of opposition
parties.
   The U.S. ambassador to Romania, Alan Green Jr., will be sent to
Bucharest to ``convey to the Romanian leadership the seriousness of
our concern,'' Boucher said. Green has been in Washington for
consultations.
   Boucher said the United States would go ahead with $80 million
in food aid and $1 million in medical aid that had already been
announced. But Washington
   ``has decided to withhold all non-humanitarian support
assistance that Romania might be eligible for,'' he said.
   The department said earlier that such assistance, of an
unspecified nature, was under consideration. Such aid often takes
the form of export credits and government loans.
   The spokesman said the aid would be withheld ``until the
democratic process is restored'' in Romania.
   Iliescu ``should provide public guarantees of safety for leaders
and members of all political parties and those who exercise their
legitimate right of dissent and should reopen independent
newspapers and magazines that were attacked on Thursday,'' Boucher
said.
   ``We urge President Iliescu and his government to engage
opposition parties and other groups in dialogue to repair the
damage to Romanian democracy caused by events of the past few
days,'' he said.

   Television monitors for viewing the videotaped
sting operation against Marion Barry are ready to go and a defense
lawyer says opening testimony in the mayor's cocaine and perjury
trial will unfold as scheduled.
   R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, discouraged suggestions
Friday that plea bargaining talks might be rekindled.
   The jury will be seated Monday and ``there is nothing,
absolutely nothing, that indicates otherwise,'' Mundy said. ``All
next week the trial will proceed; bet on it, believe it and don't
question it,'' Mundy added.
   Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday.
   Brought into the courtroom during the noon hour Friday were
television monitors and headphones so jurors may see and hear the
results of the FBI's undercover sting at a downtown Washington
hotel last Jan. 18. Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine, and
the tape is the centerpiece of the prosecution's case.
   If the trial proceeds to a conclusion without any plea bargain,
it is expected to last about a month. The U.S. attorney's office
has not said when it plans to show the videotape.
   In regard to possible talks with the government, ``there is
nothing going on, there is nothing planned to go on, there is
nothing being considered, there is nothing being talked about,''
Mundy told reporters.
   ``Nobody is sitting by the phone waiting for a call,'' he said.
``Nobody is waiting to make a call to somebody else. All that is
going to happen is the trial.''
   Eighty-one people have been sent into a pool of prospective
jurors in the last two weeks.
   Among the three people qualified Friday was Aurelia
Corbett-King, who recently defended Barry's right to remain on the
city Democratic Party's ballot. Party officials had encouraged
Barry to take himself out of the race.
   She belongs to the local Democratic committee and her husband is
a chauffeur to Walter Fauntroy, the non-voting D.C. delegate to
Congress who is one of the candidates to succeed Barry as mayor.
Barry announced Wednesday night he would not seek re-election.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to three felony counts of perjury, 10
misdemeanor counts of drug possession and one misdemeanor count of
conspiracy. Preliminary plea bargain talks broke down over
prosecutors' insistence that Barry plead guilty to a felony, while
Barry insisted he would plead guilty only to a misdemeanor, sources
close to the situation said.

<HEAD>Adventure Tourism Booming from Himalayas to the Amazon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM R. CORMIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are vacationing from the Amazon to the
Himalayas, fueling a phenomenon called ``adventure tourism'' that
has unleashed protests over the footprints left behind.
   Adventure tourism accounts for 10 percent of the U.S. travel
industry, or $1.3 billion a year, and no one knows how big it will
grow.
   The debate is heating up over the impact of tourist intrusion on
some of the most remote and ecologically fragile regions left in
the world, including Antarctica and the Galapagos Islands.
   The expeditions are growing in popularity, particularly among
older Americans with money to burn and a burning desire to visit
the last frontier lands seen only by a lucky few in their youth.
   Proponents say the trips promote ``ambassadors for the Earth.''
Critics complain of litter, contact with remote tribes and
disruption of breeding among protected wildlife.
   ``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said Bruce Manheim, an
environmentalist seeking tourist controls of one of the hottest
travel destinations _ Antarctica.
   Travel agents and tour operators are targeting affluent and
well-traveled Americans with an urgent message: ``Go now before
environmental destruction of Earth's final frontiers is complete.''
   ``If you don't go now you are going to miss it,'' said New York
travel agent Chip Snyder, who specializes in customized tours.
   He urges tourists to visit such places as Brazil, Papua New
Guinea and Indonesia.
   James Barnes, an environmentalist for Friends of the Earth, a
Washington-based lobbying group, said adventure tourism has
positive and negative consequences.
   ``On the one hand, it's always useful to have intelligent and
outwardly looking people to look at places in need of protection
and it helps to provide a constituency for protection,'' he said.
   ``But the scale of these activities is growing at such a pace
that it does provide cause for concern to a lot of environmental
groups.''
   He pointed to the Galapagos, an equatorial island chain in the
Pacific 620 miles off South America.
   Scientists warn of unchecked tourism endangering the ecosystem
there. The desolate archipelago is invaded each year by thousands
of tourists, and the scientists say some are disobeying rules,
littering and disrupting wildlife.
   Ecuador, which annexed the islands in 1832, has considered
stemming the influx by imposing stiff tariffs on foreign visitors.
   About 800 tourists visited the frozen continent of Antarctica in
1988 and nearly 3,000 in 1989, with more than 4,000 tourists
expected in the upcoming December-to-February season.
   ``This may be just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Manheim, who
has called for strict regulation of tourist activities near
wildlife breeding sites and coordination of cruise ship visits to
protected areas.
   Travel to the Himalayas also has risen.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, the 70-year-old New Zealand adventurer who
pioneered the route up Mount Everest in 1953, complained last March
of tourist development destroying the pristine innocence of the
majestic mountains.
   ``The living standards are increasing, but the beautiful tracks
and valleys have been littered,'' he said.
   In Brazil, tourism poses a different problem: encroachment on
the jungle-dwelling tribes, Barnes said. But Richard Brill, general
manager of Amazon Explorers in Parlin, N.J., said not all visitors
to that region are insensitive.
   Brill has been leading travelers to the Amazon for three decades
and said visitors come back committed to saving the rain forests.
He said tours show tourists its destruction firsthand.
   ``I can show you scores of letters from people who have taken my
voyages, who have become involved right away with the Earth,''
Brill said. ``You should see the letters to the governments to
protect the jungles and to protect the Indians.''

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. says it has no reason to
investigate complaints of sudden acceleration of its Aerostar
minivans despite an accident that killed two people in Illinois.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, demanded
a government probe Friday in a letter to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. A spokesman said the request was
being studied.
   The center has received nine reports that Aerostars accelerate
suddenly after the gear is shifted from the ``park'' position,
vehicle safety staffer Douglas Nelson said in the letter.
   A 57-year-old woman and a 17-month-old child died last Sunday
after being hit by a 1990 Aerostar at a church picnic in Nokomis,
Ill., Nelson said.
   Witnesses said the minivan's engine began racing as soon as it
was started. The driver shifted to reverse but the vehicle lurched
forward out of control, Nelson said.
   ``Ford has persistently claimed that events such as the one that
occurred in Nokomis are impossible,'' he said, adding that the
government ``hasn't pressed for the hard answers.''
   Nelson said the traffic agency should send a team of
investigators to examine the van and should open a probe of all
1986-90 Aerostars ``rather than sweep these tragic sudden
acceleration deaths under the rug as it has done so many times in
the past.''
   Ford spokeswoman Anne Doyle-Farrell said the government had
concluded a study last year that found no evidence of a mechanical
defect causing sudden acceleration in Aerostars.
   The company does not believe another probe is justified, she
said.
   ``We had a team of engineers in Nokomis yesterday cooperating
with local authorities on inspecting the vehicle,'' she said. ``The
vehicle passed just fine. There was no mechanical problem at all
with the vehicle that was related to the accident.''
   Ford has no explanation for the cause of the tragedy, Ms.
Doyle-Farrell said. ``We certainly feel very sorry about what
happened,'' she said.

   An estrogen replacement drug taken by women
who have had hysterectomies may also protect against heart disease,
a government committee says.
   There is enough evidence to conclude the drug Premarin lowered
the risk of heart disease in post-menopausal women who have had
their uteri and ovaries removed, the Food and Drug Administration's
Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee said Friday.
   But representatives of the National Women's Health Network
opposed the finding and issued a statement saying that greater use
of Premarin would be ``alarming'' until more is known about the
long-term effects of the drug, something the committee said should
be studied.
   The FDA considers recommendations by advisory committees in
establishing the approved uses for a drug. Once the agency has
established any approved use, physicians are free to prescribe the
drug for any other use.
   Premarin, manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, is an
artificial form of estrogen. It is now approved for treatment of
menopause symptoms and to help in the prevention of osteoporosis, a
thinning of bones that often occurs among women after menopause.
   Nine members of the panel voted for the conclusion and a tenth
member abstained, according to FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan.
   The studies evaluated by the advisory committee suggested that
the drug also reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by as much
as 50 percent among post-menopausal women or among women who have
had hysterectomies.
   Estrogen is one of the hormones that regulate development of the
secondary sex characteristics. The body produces it naturally
during a woman's childbearing years.
   Cruzan said the committee also concluded that the studies showed
that the health benefits from the estrogen replacement drug
outweigh the risk from side effects, providing women taking the
drug don't have other indications for caution such as smoking, a
family history of breast cancer, or a personal history of gall
bladder disease or a blood clotting disorder.
   ``It is alarming to think that millions of women may be given
this drug before either its dangers or benefits are understood,''
said David Birnbaum of the National Women's Health Network.
   Premarin is designed to restore the hormone after age, surgery
or disease ends its natural production.

<TEXT>
   Honduras is getting 25,000 metric tons of
surplus corn from the United States as part of an expanded food-aid
package.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the Agriculture
Department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Friday the corn's
value is $2.2 million. The grain will be sold by the Honduran
government to the private sector to help meet food and industrial
needs.
   What the government earns from the sales then is supposed to be
used to get food to needy families and to help farmers in projects
to increase production and marketing.
   The corn donation boosts Honduran food aid to $3.4 million from
an initial $1.2 million announced on March 9, Dickerson said.

   For the third time this month, Oliver North
has been called before a federal grand jury investigating the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   The former White House aide spent several hours before the
panel, leaving the grand jury room several times to confer with
attorneys. At the end he declined to comment to reporters.
   The grand jury is looking into Iran-contra as part of the
4{-year-old criminal investigation by independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen was seen entering the room
where the grand jury is meeting at the U.S. Courthouse.
   As part of the latest phase in its investigation, Walsh's office
is trying to determine the precise roles that President Reagan,

   The Agriculture Department has cleared the way
for the first field trials in the United States of genetically
engineered corn.
   The permit clears the way for BioTechnica Agriculture Inc. of
Overland Park, Kan., to begin its tests this month in Lisbon, Iowa,
the department said Friday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the tests will continue
through the summer. He said the company's procedures were designed
carefully so as not to disturb the environment.
   The corn being tested differs from standard seed only in that it
contains genetic marker genes. These will allow scientists to map
more exactly the locations on chromosomes of genes that determine
the corn's characteristics, including yield and resistance to
diseases.
   Once the genes are located, researchers can manipulate and
eventually introduce them into new corn varieties and other crops
as well.
   Biotechnica scientists already have examined the experimental
corn plants in the greenhouse and want to repeat the studies under
field conditions, Glosser said.
   The corn project follows announcement earlier this week of
similar field trials for soybeans and rice.

<HEAD>Germanys Agree On Settling of Property Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under an agreement between the two
Germanys, East Germany has agreed to return property confiscated by
the former Communist government or pay compensation to the original
owners.
   The property issue has been one of the most contentious as the
two Germanys move toward merging their economies.
   Former owners of property in the East who fled to the West
immediately after the war _ or after Communist East Germany was
founded in 1949 _ have been returning to stake claim on property
they contend is still theirs.
   Also Friday, West Germany's unification committee, comprised of
representatives of all parties in Parliament, agreed on a treaty
that paves the way for economic unity July 2.
   Parliamentary ratification of the agreement was expected late
next week.
   The property agreement was the result of weeks of negotiations
between the German governments. It was outlined in a four-page
statement read at a news conference by Rudolf Seiters, chief of
staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The agreement was part of overall accord on upcoming monetary
and economic unification. Representatives from the West and East
had been meeting to iron out that and other issues.
   The statement said the rights of East German renters living in
disputed apartments or on disputed property would be protected,
according to East German law.
   For East Germans who bought appropriated land, or who own
buildings which were erected on confiscated property, a ``socially
acceptable compensation'' was to be worked out either through
exchange of property of similar value or other unspecified
compensation, it said.
   The accord, however, does not apply to property confiscated
during the 1945-1949 Soviet postwar administration of the territory
that later became East Germany, Seiters said. He said the Soviets
and East Germans balked at that idea.
   It was not immediately clear how much of the property in
question was taken during the four years after the war, and
officials could not be reached for comment Friday night.
   Seiters said it would be up to a future joint German Parliament
to make a final decision on any governmental compensation for
property seized in the four years after the war.
   The agreement for the return of private assets confiscated by
the East German government applies to Germans who fled East Germany
from 1949 on and will also extend to nationalized companies.
   The statement said either the entire company would be returned
to the original owner or some form of compensation would be made.
   Seiters said the East German government was working on a program
to outline the time frame in which applications for return of
property or compensation could be submitted, and that experts from
both countries would continue working out the details of the
compensation program.
   The East German government will establish a separate fund to
take care of compensation payments, he said.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said the
Staatsvertrag, or state treaty, that won final committee approval
late Friday holds some some economic risks for East Germany, but
there was no reason for ``exaggerated pessimism.''
   ``Naturally, after 40 years of planned economy, there will be
painful cuts. Of course, some companies will have to close down,''
Haussmann said.
   Some experts have said up to 2 million East Germans could lose
their jobs as antiquated factories go bust, and there is
speculation that public unrest in East Germany could follow.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Threaten Nationwide Strike If Ryzhkov Does Not Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DONETSK, U.S.S.R (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a stern rejection of the Communist
Party leadership, coal miners from across the country have
threatened a strike next month if the government of Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov does not resign.
   The miners, closing a five-day congress Friday, also demanded
that the party relinquish control over the government and state
enterprises, and give up its vast inventory of property.
   The miners earlier announced plans to create a new labor union
independent of the party and the government.
   The actions marked the first time a national organization with
such massive support has challenged Communist Party authority so
decisively.
   Bulat Mukazhanov, chairman of the First Congress of Soviet
Miners and a representative of miners from Karaganda in Kazakhstan,
said it was not clear how many of the nation's 1 million coal
miners would heed the strike call, set for July 11.
   ``It would be a political strike,'' Mukazhanov said.
   The moves at the congress intensified the political crisis
facing Soviet President and Communist Party leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who is already dealing with secessionist republics,
ethnic violence and a crumbling economy.
   Gorbachev could be the first Soviet leader since Vladimir Lenin
to face an independent, nationally organized labor union.
   The miners did not directly challenge Gorbachev, and their
position left him a way to steer the party toward more radical
reform and force the resignation of Ryzhkov, who has been left to
bear responsibility for unpopular economic policies.
   The miners' resolution called for the resignation of the
``government,'' a reference to Ryzhkov and his Cabinet. Gorbachev
is at the beginning of a five-year term, but the prime minister can
be replaced by parliament at any time.
   Political strikes were outlawed last year, but the Soviet
government has been unable to enforce the ban. Economic strikes are
legal only after a period of negotiations.
   Last summer, about 500,000 miners walked out in the Soviet
Union's first nationwide strike, paralyzing heavy industry and
raising fears of whole cities freezing. But the winter was warm.
   Angered by the government's failure to fulfill promises it made
to end that strike, the miners formed a committee to draft bylaws
for a new union independent of the Communist Party and the
government. The union is to be founded at a second meeting,
scheduled for Aug. 15-16 in Moscow.
   The current congress, which included delegates from all 712 coal
mines in the country, suggested nationalizing the Communist Party's
huge holdings, which include buildings, publishing houses and
newspapers, automobiles and bank accounts.
   ``The Communist Party of the Soviet Union claims that it is the
party of the working class, its vanguard. We are workers, but we do
not regard the party in its present form as our party,'' read a
resolution.
   The resolution was passed by a vote of 308-116 at the conclusion
of the congress in Donetsk, the center of the largest Soviet coal
region.
   ``We demand that the Communist Party be deprived immediately of
its privileged position in our enterprises,'' it said.
   The miners said in a separate resolution that they supported a
more rapid transition to a market economy than proposed by Ryzhkov,
even though it might mean that some unprofitable mines would be
closed and miners thrown out of work.
   Ryzhkov's plan, presented to the Supreme Soviet legislature last
month and defended by Gorbachev on national television, called for
the price of bread to triple on July 1, and the price of most other
food to double at the beginning of next year.
   The legislature has delayed the unpopular bread increase for at
least two months. It has told the government to come back in the
fall with more detailed plans for economic reform.

   Ride somebody's tail on the highway in
some states and they might take a pot shot at you. In Massachusetts
they might draw swords.
   A couple who apparently thought a big-rig truck was following
too closely stopped the car and assaulted the truck driver with
antique swords, state Trooper Stephen Earle said Friday.
   ``Never a dull moment,'' said Earle of the Wednesday altercation
on Route 3 in Duxbury. ``I've seen fistfights, and of course you
always hear about people pulling guns, but this is the first time
I've ever had anyone pull a sword.''
   No one was injured. The truck driver used a long metal hook to
defend himself, Earle said.
   ``I tell you he was a little astounded,'' Earle said.
   Robert M. Nightingale, 29, of Quincy, and Edith Kigsbury, 24, of
Marshfield, pleaded innocent Thursday in Plymouth District Court to
charges including assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
   Nightingale apparently kept one sword in the car's back seat and
one in the trunk, Earle said.
   Massachusetts law forbids Nightingale from carrying a firearm
because he is a convicted felon, Earle said.
   ``This may have been his remedy to that situation,'' Earle said.
   Nightingale posted bail, which was set at $2,500. The woman was
released without bail. A pre-trial hearing was scheduled for June
20.

   The blaze aboard the leaking Mega Borg
has been extinguished and firefighters doused the sizzling
supertanker today to avoid a flare-up.
   The fire was put out Friday, but Coast Guard and state officials
warned that the Norwegian ship crippled in an explosion June 8
still posed a threat.
   ``There are no flames. However it's still real hot and if we
walk away from it right now, it may reflash. It's not yet dead,''
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson said.
   The accident left 4.3 million gallons of light African crude in
the Gulf of Mexico _ the fifth worst spill in U.S. history. Tar
balls from a 10-mile long slick were expected Sunday on the Bolivar
Peninsula, about 40 miles east of Galveston.
   Tar balls from the spill had been expected to hit shore Friday,
but Jerry Galt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in Houston said changing currents and atmospheric
conditions delayed their arrival.
   Scientists on Friday unleashed experimental oil-eating bacteria
on a patch of the slick and awaited results of the procedure,
called bioremediation.
   Salvage crews today hoped to transfer oil remaining in a
ruptured 5.5 million tank to an undamaged tank to stop a continuing
leak and to balance the 886-foot ship. The supertanker was loaded
with 38 million gallons of oil.
   An official from Det Norske Veritas, Norway's equivalent to the
American Bureau of Shipping, was expected to board the Mega Borg to
inspect damage over the weekend.
   The ship, with its rear section awash and seared by fiery
explosions, was clear of smoke for the first time Friday.
   ``I feel like I am face to face with my enemy,'' said Texas
Water Commission Chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne, looking at the
listing hulk from a Coast Guard boat about 100 yards away.
   ``For the first time since this thing began, I'm beginning to
believe we can beat it. But I know there is going to be a next
time,'' Wynne said.
   More than two dozen boats were expected to continue skimming
spilled oil today. Salvage crews said they have collected 146,389
gallons of oil. The Coast Guard said Friday most of the light crude
that spilled either evaporated or burned and less than 22,000
gallons remained in the water.
   Carl Oppenheimer, a scientist who developed bioremediation and
was eager to see it tested for the first time on oil in open seas,
joined officials unleashing trillions of oil-eating microbes on the
rust-colored slick.
   They sprayed the bacteria mixture on an acre of oil about three
miles southeast of the Mega Borg.
   The bacteria will break the oil down into harmless fatty acids
that will be consumed by marine life, said Oppenheimer, a
University of Texas microbiologist who has been working on the
process for 15 years.
   Oppenheimer predicted the acre would be clear of oil in one or
two days.
   ``This is breakthrough technology,'' Texas Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro said.
   Investigators have not determined the cause of the fire that
killed two of the ship's 41 crew members, injured 17 and left two
missing and presumed dead.
   A panel convened by Norwegian consul general Erik Leikvang
concluded a three-day hearing Friday.
   At the hearing, officials asked third mate Jaipal Singh Mahlawat
to elaborate on a fuel leak discovered in the ship's pump room six
hours before the explosion.
   ``I saw the pump man, he was screwing a coupling back to stop
the oil from leaking,'' Mahlawat said. ``No oil was leaking. He had
already wiped it out.''
   The pump man, Putham Mahamood, testified Thursday through a
translator that he performed ``no measurable repair work'' the day
of the explosion.
   The Mega Borg's chief engineer told the panel Thursday one of
the vessel's pumps was leaking fuel about six hours before the
explosion, and a Norwegian shipping inspector said some other pumps
were overdue for an inspection.
   Coast Guard investigator Ruben Arredondo, who sat in on
testimony but was not a member of the panel, said the oil leak may
have provided the fuel source for a fire sparked by something such
as a bad light fixture.
   The panel will send its report to the Norwegian maritime
investigative bureau, which will determine if the ship is seaworthy
and if there is any criminal liability.

<HEAD>Facts on Bacteria Microbes to Be Used on Oil Slick</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Tanker Blast, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are the key facts about bioremediation, an experimental
plan to dump oil-eating bacteria on the Mega Borg oil slick in the
Gulf of Mexico off Galveston, Texas:
   DESCRIPTION: Bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria
microbes, which have a sandlike consistency, to reduce oil to an
emulsion of fatty acids. The emulsion sinks and is consumed by
marine life. Microbes die when they cannot find any more oil to eat.
   USES: The microbes have been used for years to clean up
hazardous waste sites, treat sewage and wastewaters, and extract
oil from tight geologic formations. They were used to clean some
rocks on shore after the Exxon Valdez accident last year in Alaska.
Their use off Texas was the first time bioremediation has been used
in the water to clean up an oil spill.
   PLAN: State officials mixed the bacteria in 100-gallon tanks of
salt water and shot it through hoses from a Coast Guard cutter.
   AMOUNT: Officials planned to use 100 pounds of the bacteria each
day for three to four days on freshly spilled oil near the vessel.
   COST: The test will cost the state about $50,000.

<HEAD>Knighthoods for Peter Ustinov and Kingsley Amis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor-author Peter Ustinov and writer Kingsley
Amis became the newest knights of the realm today in the birthday
honors list of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Ustinov, the 69-year-old actor, author, dramatist, film
director, newspaper columnist and raconteur, was named a Knight
Bachelor. So was Amis, 67, author of ``The Old Devils,'' ``Lucky
Jim'' and most recently, ``The Folks That Live on The Hill.''
   Ustinov, who was made a CBE, or Companion of British Empire in
1975, was asked how he felt about being knighted.
   ``I cannot see it making any difference. I shall go on working.
It's like another flag on Everest,'' Ustinov said.
   ``My reaction is one of unqualified delight,'' Amis said. ``It
is wonderful news.''
   The honors, and others to writer Anita Brookner, historian
Martin Gilbert and fashion designer Bruce Oldfield, were actually
chosen by the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The government rewards the loyalty and service of hundreds of
people twice each year _ at the New Year and in June, in honor of
the monarch's official birthday.
   Queen Elizabeth was born April 21, 1926, but her official
birthday is marked on a day in June when there is a marginally
better chance of sunny weather for parades and celebrations.
   The honors list showered medals and awards on hundreds of other
Britons, some of whom made their mark in obscure professions.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie receives a peerage that will enable
him to sit in the House of Lords as Baron Runcie following his
retirement as Anglican archbishop of Canterbury next year.
   Dame Lydia Dunn, a senior Hong Kong legislator who has become a
well-known figure in the preparations for China's takeover of the
British colony in 1997, becomes a baroness.
   Ms. Brookner, who won the prestigious Booker Prize in 1984 for
her novel, ``Hotel du Lac,'' was made a CBE. The same honor went to
actress Eileen Atkins, an actress and co-creator of the television
series ``Upstairs, Downstairs.''
   Oldfield, 39, reared in a Yorkshire children's home, became a
favorite fashion designer of the Princess of Wales. He was made an
OBE, or Officer of the Order of British Empire.
   Tracy Edwards, 27, whose all-woman crew placed second in their
class in the Whitbread around-the-word yacht race, became an MBE,
or Member of the Order of British Empire.
   Tucked away in the shadow of these luminaries, among the head
librarians, tax inspectors and civil service secretaries, are
professions less glamorous than drama and fashion.
   British Empire Medals went to Herbert Plenty, cheese-grader for
the Milk Marketing Board, and Florence Clary, the keykeeper of
Mistley Towers, Essex.
   The honors bear nothing except a medal and the right to put
letters such as OBE and MBE after a name, but they are a matter of
great pride to recipients.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Responsibility for Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army has claimed
responsibility for two bombings that did extensive damage this week
to the mansion of a Conservative Party official and an army
training center in West Germany.
   No one was hurt in either blast. The explosion at the army
diving school in Hamelin Thursday ripped apart the building, which
was empty at the time but is used regularly by British, Dutch and
West German troops.
   The bombing of the 18th century mansion, West Green House, in
the southern English village of Hartley Wintney, blew out windows
and part of the front of the red brick home on Tuesday.
   The house had been occupied until three weeks ago by Lord
McAlpine, a former deputy chairman and treasurer of the
Conservative Party.
   The explosion tore a three-foot hole in the front of the
restored mansion, demolished part of a garden wall and left a
crater in the gravel drive.
   The British news agency Press Association said the IRA claimed
the bombings in a statement issued in Dublin.
   The outlawed IRA, in a new and bloody offensive aimed mainly at
British targets outside Northern Ireland, has killed seven people
in the past few weeks and mounted half a dozen attacks in England.
   The mainly Roman Catholic organization is waging a violent
campaign to end British rule in the predominantly Protestant
province of Northern Ireland and unite it with the republic of
Ireland.

   Cement blocks were all that remained of
homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy
streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town
after a furious flash flood.
   Residents donned shorts and hip-waders Friday to begin putting
their lives back together after 5{ inches of rain fell in 3{ hours
late Thursday, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people
dead and 51 others missing early today.
   The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink,
whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty,
including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.
   ``We have counselors back there now, but we've lost whole
families. It's just been devastating,'' he said Friday night.
   Fink said he feared there wouldn't be enough funeral homes to
handle the dead in this eastern Ohio town of 4,300 people.
   Allan Hans called the flooding ``the devil's work.''
   ``I lost everything but my car and the clothes I'm wearing,'' he
said.
   Hans said he was sitting in his trailer when he heard a branch
crack and went to check out the noise. He saw rushing water, ran to
tell neighbors and moved his car. The trailer was swept away by the
time he returned home.
   John and Sue Wright, whose home rests on the banks of Pipe
Creek, estimated they lost about $20,000 worth of property.
   ``I was one of the lucky ones. What I lost, I can replace,''
Wright said.
   Although it was the center of rescue operations, downtown
Shadyside suffered no apparent flood damage. But it was a different
story on the outskirts of town, in the heart of Ohio's richest coal
fields.
   Cars were mired roof-deep in mud, and guardrails and chunks of
concrete were torn from roads.
   A 20-foot, 18-inch thick beam that held a sign leading to 3K's
Bar near Pipe Creek was twisted like a pretzel by the force of what
witnesses described as a wall of water.
   People moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that
span McMann Creek, which links homes to Ohio Route 147. Many
bridges were washed away.
   Small tractors and four-wheel-drive vehicles were the only means
of transportation in much of the stricken area.
   At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called in
to patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg,
a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
   Disasters always bring out the curious, and this was no
exception. By Friday night, traffic jammed Ohio Route 7, which
skirts the Ohio River and is the main north-south road through town.
   Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said he suspected many of the
vehicles belonged to sightseers.
   McCort said there were no serious attempts at looting. He said
he was pleased with the assistance of young people.
   One young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins
lost in the flood, the sheriff said.
   ``The kid ... handed me this box and it was unlocked,'' McCort
said. ``It really made me feel good.''

<HEAD>`Dick Tracy' Gets Positive Reviews</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Dick Tracy,'' facing stiff competition this
weekend at the box office, got mostly rave reviews from critics.
   The Walt Disney Co. production could generate box-office
receipts of $30 million from its debut on about 2,200 screens
nationwide this weekend.
   An entertainment industry analyst, Jeffrey Logsdon of Crowell
Weedon &amp; Co., said the film might bring in up to $7 million more
from special early screenings starting at midnight Thursday.
   On Friday, Disney stocks were up $2.75 to $131.75 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange as doubts about the success of the $35
million production faded.
   ``There were some concerns that `Dick Tracy' would be a flop ...
but it's a commercially viable product,'' Logsdon said. He said the
stock's rise was due to the realization that Disney continues to
surprise its doubters.
   Critic Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times on Friday that
the film directed by and starring Warren Beatty, ``is a great
uninterrupted grin ... a movie that finds funniness in the most
unexpected places and characters.''
   Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times called it ``a film of
enormous style, with a sure sense of itself.''
   Associated Press critic Bob Thomas said the film ``is
distinguished by its originality.''
   Two of the few negative reviews of the film appeared in The Wall
Street Journal and the trade newspaper Daily Variety. The film also
stars Madonna, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman.
   The film's immediate competition will be ``Gremlins 2: The New
Batch,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall'' and Eddie
Murphy's ``Another 48 HRS.'' The original ``Gremlins,'' released in
1984, produced worldwide revenues of $200 million.
   Almost a year ago, Warner Bros. opened ``Batman'' to record
business of $40.5 million in one weekend. ``Batman'' went on to
gross more than $250 million domestically.
   ``There's a big question as to how (this weekend) is going to
come out,'' said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.,
which studies box-office figures. ``It's going to be an interesting
contest.''

<HEAD>Government Agrees to Help Film Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to inject $8.5 million
into Britain's foundering film industry in an effort to turn around
seven years of hard times.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told a meeting of film industry
representatives Friday that the money will be used over the next
three years to help British filmmakers seeking co-productions
elsewhere in Europe.
   Theater attendance soared last year in Britain, but British film
production reached its lowest level since 1981. Britain made only
25 films last year, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Some production companies have gone bust. The best known is
Goldcrest films, which helped bring ``Chariots of Fire,''
``Gandhi'' and ``The Killing Fields'' to the screen. The
independent company's work between 1977 and 1986 received dozens of
awards, including 19 Oscars, but it collapsed after a series of
flops.
   The lag followed a boom in the early 1980s, when the industry
seemed reborn. When ``Chariots'' scriptwriter Colin Welland
accepted the 1982 Academy Award for best film, he declared
triumphantly, ``The British are coming!''
   British films have not benefited from the government support
given the industry in countries like Australia and France.
   ``The British film industry has a proud record of excellence.
But film production in this country has been on the decline,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said. ``This is an industry in which Britain cannot just
compete _ we can excel.''
   The meeting was attended by Sir Richard Attenborough, the
director of ``Gandhi,'' and David Puttnam, who produced ``Chariots
of Fire.''
   ``I am hugely encouraged,'' Puttnam said. ``All we have asked
for over a long period of time is a hearing, and that is what we
have had.''
   He called the $8.5 million ``a goodwill gesture.''
   ``What is more important over the long term is the formation of
the working parties,'' he said. The committees are to look into
setting up government incentives to attract private money.
   Mrs. Thatcher also said the industry will study taxes on film
production and report back to the government.
   In addition, the government will provide an additional $263,500
to support the 1990 European Film Awards in Glasgow, Scotland.
   The film industry representatives said their main concern was
the lack of British investment in its own film industry. They said
money was available from the United States, but any profits go
right back across the Atlantic.

<HEAD>Draft EPA Report Says Second-Hand Smoke Kills 32,000 Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tobacco Institute and a congressman are
pressing the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw or revise
a draft report that incorporates the finding that second-hand
tobacco smoke causes 32,000 heart disease deaths among non-smokers.
   The finding has been incorporated into an EPA ``technical
compendium'' of the latest research on passive smoking, sometimes
referred to as ``environmental tobacco smoke,'' or ETS.
   The report has not yet been released. Documents with information
on its contents were obtained by The Associated Press from the
Tobacco Institute and from the office of Rep. Thomas Bliley of
Richmond, Va.
   ``It would ... in my judgment be most inappropriate to include
this paper in its present form in the EPA ETS Compendium of
Technical Information,'' wrote W. Gary Flamm, a Tobacco Institue
consultant, in summarizing the six-inch high stack of comments that
the Tobacco Institute sent to the EPA.
   The chapter was written by Stanton Glantz and William Parmley,
both professors in the department of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco. Parmley is a past president of the
American College of Cardiology.
   Elissa Feldman in the EPA's indoor air division said the
technical compendium is still undergoing revision, and that it
probably would not be released until later this summer.
   Glantz presented many of the chapter's findings on May 21 at a
scientific conference in Boston, but he did not disclose that they
were included in the EPA's passive smoking report.
   Robert Axelrad, director of the EPA's indoor air division, said
Glantz had been given permission to discuss his findings as long as
he did not mention his connection with the EPA.
   He noted that the technical compendium was not a determination
by the EPA of the risks associated with passive smoking, but a
collection of state-of-the-art summaries of research on passive
smoking.
   ``It will contain disclaimers that the views of the individual
authors do not represent the views of the EPA,'' he said.
   The link between the EPA document and Glantz's presentation in
Boston came in a June 6 letter to EPA Administrator William Reilly,
in which Bliley said that Glantz's presentation in Boston was based
on the EPA report.
   Bliley has had a long interest in tobacco issues. Philip Morris
is the largest private employer in his congressional district.
   The chapter concludes that passive smoking causes 32,000 heart
disease deaths each year and a total of 50,000 deaths each year,
when heart disease and cancers are combined.
   That makes passive smoking the third leading cause of
preventable death, behind smoking and alcohol, the report concludes.
   The study, based on a review of existing scientific studies,
also concludes that passive smoking increases a non-smoker's chance
of dying from heart disease by 20 percent to 30 percent.
   Glantz said he could not discuss the details of the criticisms
from the Tobacco Institute and Bliley until the EPA report is
released.
   He did make several general comments, however. ``All of the
people who have reviewed this material, both within the EPA and as
it was submitted to the scientific peer review process, have been
favorable _ except the Tobacco Institute,'' he said.
   The comments from the Tobacco Institute and Bliley's letter both
include a strongly worded personal attack on Glantz, using similar
language. They accused him of being an anti-smoking advocate whose
political activity compromises the integrity of his scientific work.
   ``The fact that they're conducting an ad-hominem attack on me
shows that they can't find anything wrong with our work,'' Glantz
said.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Nearly $7.6 Million to Widow of Prison Author's Victim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Henry Abbott, whose prison writings became
a best-selling book, lost a nearly $7.6 million court judgment to
the widow of an aspiring actor he killed.
   A jury awarded the money Friday to Ricci Adan, whose 22-year-old
husband, Richard, was stabbed in the heart outside a Manhattan
restaurant where he worked as a waiter in 1981.
   Abbott, whose writings were brought to public attention by
Norman Mailer, is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for
first-degree manslaughter in the slaying.
   Mrs. Adan, 32, and her family sat quietly as the court clerk
polled the jury at Abbott's request. Leaving the courtroom, they
whooped, shouted and hugged in celebration of the verdict after a
two-week civil trial on Mrs. Adan's wrongful death lawsuit against
Abbott.
   Abbott, who acted as his own attorney, said to the judge, ``This
is a little excessive, your honor, wouldn't you say?''
   The judge, Carol Arber, advised Abbott he could appeal, but he
did not say whether he would.
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' said Mrs. Adan, who had to be
cross-examined by her husband's killer. She said of her slain
husband: ``He's not just a speck of dust anymore. He's not just a
victim, or a piece of paper; he's a human being. And he can rest
now.''
   Adan died July 18, 1981, just six weeks after Abbott paroled on
earlier convictions.
   Naomi Zack, the State University of New York philosophy
instructor Abbott married last September while in prison, was not
in court for the verdict. She had been present almost every day at
the trial and was the only witness Abbott called.
   Abbott tried to convince the jury that Adan endured no pain and
suffering because the single knife thrust through the heart killed
him instantly.
   ``I'm no savage,'' Abbott said.
   In a savage and ``atrocious'' murder, the killer tries to
inflict maximum damage on his victim, Abbott said.
   Mrs. Adan was in tears at Abbott's descriptions of the killing.
   Abbott, 46, sneered at a Pace University economist's projections
that Adan might have earned $17 million as a successful actor by
the time he was 65. Abbott said the calculation assumed Adan
``would have been a movie star of the caliber of Paul Newman.'
   Abbott gained fame from writing ``In the Belly of the Beast,'' a
best-seller composed of letters he wrote to Mailer from prison
between 1978 and 1981.
   During those years, Abbott was behind bars first for bank
robbery and then for fatally stabbing another inmate. Mailer later
supported Abbott's parole, largely because of his writing talent.
   Mailer, who attended Abbott's criminal trial, was absent from
the latest one. Mailer has been unavailable for comment on Abbott's
latest court drama.
   Mrs. Adan's lawyers estimate that Abbott has a little more than
$100,000 in escrow held by the Manhattan sheriff in case of a civil
judgment in Mrs. Adan's favor. Practically all of that money comes
from ``In the Belly of the Beast.''
   Abbott also has $15,000, also earned from his writings, held by
the state Crime Victims Board.
   The jury awarded Mrs. Adan $5.575 million in compensatory
damages for lost income and $2 million for her husband's pain and
suffering before his death.

<HEAD>Japan and U.S. Must Put in Strong Efforts for Trade Agreement,
Baker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
with his Japanese counterpart and said afterward it will take a
``strong effort'' from both countries to reach a final trade
agreement by the end of the month.
   The United States and Japan are rushing to draw up a final
agreement aimed at correcting a trade imbalance between the
countries in time for next month's seven-nation economic summit in
Houston.
   ``Our two nations, the two largest economies in the world, have
an obligation to offer constructive international leadership,''
Baker said in a statement after the 3{-hour meeting at the Fairmont
Hotel. ``We believe we can do so as global partners.''
   Foreign Minister Tara Nakayama told Baker that Japan was
``making efforts'' to correct the trade imbalance between the
nations, a Japanese government spokesman told reporters.
   Less than two weeks remain before Japan and the United States
are scheduled to wrap up trade talks and draw up a formal list of
economic reforms. Friday's discussion reportedly was called so the
officials could attempt to revive the talks, which have become
stalled in recent months.
   Nakayama ``made it clear that the Japanese government is making
efforts to reduce its current trade surplus,'' Makoto Yamanaka, a
spokesman for the Japanese foreign minister, told reporters.
   Yamanaka stopped short of saying that Friday's discussion had
revived the stalled talks, known as the Structural Impediment
Initiative, saying only that progress was ``important'' to both
governments.
   The spokesman declined to discuss the specifics of the meeting
of Baker and Nakayama, but he said the two talked about Eastern
Europe, China and Mongolia as well as the trade imbalance.
   Baker said it would take a ``good strong effort on both sides''
to come up with a final agreement.
   One point of contention is that the Bush administration has
called for Japan to spend at least 9 percent of its gross national
product on government construction projects. Yamanaka said the
foreign minister still had some resistance to a specific spending
requirement.
   The United States' trade deficit with Japan is $49 billion a
year.
   In April, the two countries tentatively outlined a series of
economic reforms. Japan agreed to open its retailing system,
increase spending on public works projects, strengthen antitrust
legislation and loosen restrictions on foreign investment.
   The United States pledged to cut its federal budget deficit and
take measures to increase savings and investment.
   The SII talks, begun last year, have been bogged down lately
with Japan indicating its made all the concessions it can.
Meanwhile, the United States is characterizing the April accord as
a ``way station'' with more concrete language needed to carry out
the promises.
   Congressional critics have said the Bush Administration's
decision to remove Japan from a tough section of trade law called
Super 301, which threatens economic sanctions, has allowed Japan to
refuse further concessions.
   Negotiators are supposed to conclude the talks June 25-26 in
Tokyo.

   Brandeis University President Evelyn E.
Handler plans to resign to pursue other interests at the end of the
next school year.
   ``I have been privileged to have served Brandeis since 1983, and
I have accomplished most of what I set out to do,'' said Handler,
the school's fifth president.
   ``I am ready for new challenges and Brandeis, too, is ready for
change, change that will prepare it for the new millennium,''
Handler said Friday.
   Handler, a former president of the University of New Hampshire,
said her last year will be spent outlining priorities for the
university's future. She also was a faculty member and academic
dean at Hunter College in New York City.
   Handler is the third Boston-area president to step down this
year. The others were Harvard University president Derek Bok and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Paul Gray.

   A county sheriff used the luck of the
draw to determine which of two laid-off deputy sheriffs to rehire.
   R.C. Godsey won the draw on Friday and returns to work July 1,
Fayette County Sheriff Bill Laird said.
   A secretary shook up a box containing the names of Godsey and
Garland Burke. Laird said he drew Godsey's name.
   ``I don't particularly like this approach to decision making,''
Laird said. But the two deputies' seniority was the equal, and
state law provided no other guidance on how to decide.
   Burke had no comment, The Register-Herald in Beckley said.
   Godsey and Burke were laid off Jan. 1, 1989, because of budget
cuts.
   ``I just wish that both of us could have come back,'' Godsey
said.

   Crimestoppers Tip No. 134: If you're paying $345
for a yellow overcoat, you're being robbed.
   But nobody held a gun on the shoppers who turned out at
Manhattan stores Friday and kicked off the Dick Tracy paraphernalia
onslaught by laying out cash for yellow fedoras ($30), Tracy towels
($20) and Tracy T-shirts ($14).
   Want the great detective's jutting jaw on your face? $50 for a
mask. How about a denim jacket with his likeness across the back?
$115. A leather bomber jacket with the omnipresent Tracy logo?
$195. Or his trademark yellow trenchcoat? $345.
   Believe it, sweetheart. And stores were giving customers the
hard sell on these goods, which were generated by the superhyped
Warren Beatty flick which opened at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   The second floor at Bloomingdale's featured a stack of eight
televisions running the movie's trailer nonstop. In another section
of The Dick Tracy Shop there, co-star Madonna belted out ``Vogue''
and songs from the film soundtrack over and over and over ...
   ``This is all for that movie?'' asked one woman as she handed
over $28 for a pair of T-shirts. The Tracy togs were so prevalent
that they displaced Bart Simpson and family from the top of the
T-shirt racks.
   ``It's great. My wife says they're quite well made, not
trashy,'' said Roger Dutton, a Melbourne, Australia, resident who
was clutching a pair of towels. ``You pay premium for the premium
goods, I guess.''
   The trashy stuff was in another section of the store. Lacy
bustiers, flapper dresses and other skin-flashing selections worn
by Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) drew plenty of interest, but not as
many buyers.
   ``If I could get away with this stuff in Kokomo, I'd wear it,''
said Linda Dechert, who was visiting from Indiana. ``I think this
stuff will catch on with the younger crowd. Madonna's so popular.''
   The Breathless outfits actually aren't as daring as the ones
that cling to Madonna in the movie.
   ``Some of her gowns were slit down to the navel. We didn't go
quite that far,'' said Elaine Johnson of L.A. Glo, which is
handling the clothes.
   At Macy's flagship store, the eighth floor was covered in Tracy
yellow, with painted black silhouettes of Tracy and his nemeses Big
Boy and Flattop.
   ``Calling All Crimestoppers to Herald Square'' read a Macy's
newspaper ad, and more people than that responded. Although store
policy is not to release sales figures, things were going well on
Day One of the Tracy explosion.
   ``Our shop is well-traveled, quite popular,'' said Barbara
Lewinski, spokeswoman for the store. ``And once the film opens this
weekend, it should get bigger.''

<HEAD>Deadly Detroit Celebration Doesn't Surprise Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young said the violence that killed
seven people during the Detroit Pistons' basketball championship
celebration disappointed but didn't surprise him.
   ``There are always some, who under cover of celebration, will
break the law. Always. And that's what happened last night,'' Young
said Friday, addressing a group of visiting journalists at a
city-sponsored media day.
   ``But there sure wasn't any wild explosion of killings,'' Young
added.
   Seven people were killed, six of them hit by cars, and hundreds
were injured by gunfire, stabbings and fighting, police said.
   Looting and raucous behavior led to dozens of arrests after fans
jammed streets to mark Detroit's 92-90 victory over the Portland
Trail Blazers for the National Basketball Association title.
   Four people were killed and one person was injured when a car
plowed into a group of pedestrians celebrating on the city's east
side at 1:15 a.m. Friday. Police arrested a 41-year-old man and
confiscated his car 10 hours later.
   The accident killed a 9-year-old boy, a 10-year-old boy, a
15-year-old girl and a 21-year-old man, said Police Sgt.
Christopher Buck. A man with a broken leg was hospitalized, Buck
said.
   In River Rouge, a southern suburb, a 4-year-old boy was struck
and killed by a car during a street celebration. A man whose name
and age weren't released died after he was hit by a car outside a
party store in Detroit, police said.
   The seventh victim was a 21-year-old man who fell from the roof
of an apartment building during a celebration party, said Diane
Cuper, a spokeswoman for Detroit Receiving Hospital.
   Detroit's victory brought fans rushing from their homes to dance
in the streets and on car roofs. They waved fists and shirts,
dribbling and tossing basketballs in their excitement.
   Gunshots were fired by armed partiers. Police said there were 31
incidents of malicious destruction of property in Detroit
neighborhoods.
   Thirty-five people were arrested or detained for disorderly
conduct in Detroit, and River Rouge police arrested 28 revelers,
most on disorderly conduct charges.
   Mike Toma said he plans to sell his Monte Carlo Foods store,
which was looted of beer, wine, meats, a television, a shotgun and
a money order machine. He had stayed open late, watching the NBA
finals on television, he said.
   ``I was excited. I went out to go home and everybody was
excited. Then excitement turned to disaster,'' he said. ``They tied
something round the window bars and dragged them out with a truck.
   ``I'm going to put this store up for sale _ for any price. I'm
fed up.''
   On Detroit's west side, a merchant was questioned and released
after two people were shot while trying to break into his store,
police said.
   ``It was like hundreds of them with bats and bricks and it
scared him,'' Maggie Varner, manager of the Beebe Party Store, said
of the owner.
   ``He panicked,'' she said. ``They started breaking the door.
When I came in this morning, we washed the blood off the sidewalk.''
   A 17-year-old was shot in the head and listed in critical
condition at Mount Carmel Hospital, spokeswoman Rose Dale said. The
other man, age 21, was being treated for a gunshot wound to the leg.
   Varner said owner Jack Beebe, 60, was resting at home after the
incident.
   The mob violence was reminiscent of 1984, when the Detroit
Tigers won the World Series. More than 100,000 people poured into
the streets, overturning cars, looting and causing widespread
damage. One person died.
   Last year, carloads of boisterous fans also jammed streets after
the Pistons, the ``Bad Boys'' of basketball, swept the Los Angeles
Lakers in four games for their first NBA crown. But that
celebration was free of violence.

<HEAD>Talks Fail to Resolve Differences Over Cambodia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Chinese official says two days
of talks in Hanoi failed to narrow differences between China and
Vietnam over how to end the 11-year-old Cambodian war.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Xu Dunxin headed the first high-level
Chinese delegation to visit Vietnam since the two countries fought
a border war in 1979. The conflict came a few weeks after Vietnam
invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge from power.
   Xu and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co held
discussions in Hanoi on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Xu spoke Friday in Bangkok. His comments were reported by the
official Chinese news agency Xinhua.
   He was quoted as saying the two countries remain divided over
two key points: the status of Cambodia's government during the
transition period before a new administration, and the status of
its army during that period.
   China is the principal backer of three Cambodian guerrilla
factions _ including the Khmer Rouge _ fighting the
Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh.
   There have been proposals that the United Nations become
involved in adminstering the country to prepare the way for
elections once the warring factions have agreed to a cease-fire.
   But Xinhua quoted Xu as saying: ``We came to know through the
exchange of views that Vietnam does not agree to bringing into full
play the role of the United Nations.''
   He said the Vietnamese did not agree to an interim U.N.
trusteeship for Cambodia or even to stationing a U.N. peacekeeping
force there.
   Xu said there are no plans for further talks. The Hanoi
discussions were the fourth round of Sino-Vietnamese talks over the
past year and a half.
   Vietnam has sought to improve ties with China as the Soviet
Union cuts back its economic and political support for Hanoi and
Eastern European countries drift toward the West.
   Official Radio Hanoi on Thursday gave only a brief and vague
report on the talks, indicating little progress was made.
   The latest efforts to end the fighting in Cambodia were set back
earlier this month when the Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla
faction, refused to sign a cease-fire pact in Tokyo, saying it was
denied equal representation in the negotiations. China also refused
to support the agreement.

   Thunderstorms roamed the central Plains and the western Midwest
early today and rain fell in parts of the West.
   Rain-threatening clouds dissipated and left clear skies along
the Eastern seaboard.
   Drizzle fell on central North Dakota, southwest South Dakota and
eastern Minnesota and in San Fransico, Seattle, Salt Lake City and
central Wyoming.
   Intense thunderstorms struck eastern Nebraska early today.
   Hot and muggy weather was forecast today from the Plains to the
East Coast. Tropical air from Mexico riding ahead of a cold front
was expected to unleash thunderstorms from west Texas to the
Midwest.
   Tornadoes downed farms, trees and power lines Friday in
southwest Nebraska, but caused no deaths or injuries, authorities
said. Cattle and horses were killed by twisters cutting a 25-mile
path in Hitchcock County, authorities said.
   Violent thunderstorms swept Kansas on Friday, damaging windows
in about 100 homes and several rooftops in Topeka. A car dealership
there reported 80 or 90 cars had their windshields blown out.
   The high Friday in the Lower 48 states was 105 degrees in
Laredo, Texas.

   A small-plane crash killed a retired
air force colonel and a college professor about to wrap up a
48-state peace tour.
   Retired Air Force Col. Frank Martineau, 69, of Bethesda, Md.,
and Marjorie Zeuch, 67, of Warwick, R.I., died Friday when their
single-engine plane crashed short of an airport runway, said Maj.
Robert Wolfe of the Air National Guard in Charleston.
   The two also were trying to set a speed record for flying a
single-engine plane to all capitals in the contiguous 48 states.
Charleston was their next-to-last stop before winding up the trip
later Friday at Washington National Airport in Virginia.
   ``He had fuel on board and the landing gear was down,'' said
Frank Gurish, a Federal Aviation Administration investigator at the
scene. ``It would appear he was of the notion he was on a normal
landing pattern. It was on course. It was just lower than he should
have been.''
   The four-seat plane clipped a tree in a park about one-half mile
short of the Yeager Airport runway, Wolfe said. The plane spun
around and landed on its nose, with the right wing torn off in
several pieces, said Sgt. Vic Gazitano of the Kanawha County
Sheriff's Department.
   Despite light rain, visibility was 1 mile and ``the weather was
good enough to permit landings,'' said Jack Depew, manager of the
airport control tower.
   Zeuch was an English professor at Rhode Island Community
College. Martineau had been a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force
and the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II.
   The 4,000-mile trip, dubbed ``Operation Appleseed,'' was taken
to promote Zeuch's World Friendship Association, said Chuck
Davenport, managing editor of Association Trends, a national weekly
newspaper founded by Martineau.
   The association, a 2-year-old charitable organization, was
``dedicated to bringing ordinary people of the world closer
together for permanent peace,'' Davenport said.
   Edward Cornish, whose son is married to Martineau's daughter,
helped answer telephones at the newspaper's Bethesda, Md., office
Friday.
   ``(Zeuch) had this mission of spreading friendship, and Frank
thought this would be a good project for the association to be
involved with,'' Cornish said.
   ``Obviously everybody's in shock,'' he said.

   A man posing as a building inspector
bound and gagged two clerks at a jewelry store and made off with
more than $500,000 worth of goods, police said.
   The robber entered the Gold Connection early Friday and said he
was there to inspect something in the basement, police Detective
Sgt. Dennis Gerstmeyer said.
   The two women led him into a back room where a safe was located
without asking for identification, Gerstmeyer said. He said the two
thought the man had a gun, although they didn't see one.
   The man emptied the safe of mostly gold jewelry and some
diamonds after tying the wrists of the women and taping their
mouths, Gerstmeyer said. The safe was already open to stock store
shelves.
   The robber stuffed the jewelry into two shopping bags and
slipped into a crowd outside, Gerstmeyer said.

   A kidnapped American whose family raised
$60,000 ransom in a public appeal was seized in South America after
his boss at a gold mine refused to pay blackmail to a former
employee, a television station reported.
   Citing legal documents filed in a court in Quito, Ecuador,
WHOI-TV in Peoria reported Friday that Scott Heimdal's kidnapping
apparently was not a random terrorist act as previously thought.
   In the documents, Heimdal's boss, Jeffrey Fino, general manager
of IMINCO gold mine in Quito, said a former employee had tried to
blackmail him and orchestrated Heimdal's kidnapping.
   Fino claimed the worker was running guns to Colombian terrorists
as well, WHOI reported.
   The former employee allegedly contacted Fino in February to tell
him a terrorist group wanted to kidnap and kill him, but Fino
ignored the warning, the station reported.
   WHOI also said the former employee made several attempts through
blackmail to get Fino to pay $40,000, which Fino rejected.
   Heimdal, 27, formerly of Peoria, was kidnapped April 28 when a
band of armed men attacked a canoe he was aboard, killed the pilot
and took Heimdal and an Ecuadoran hostage.
   The attackers, earlier believed to be Colombian guerrillas,
freed the Ecuadoran and sent him to Quito with the ransom demand.
   According to Fino's documents, the former employee knew Heimdal
was a key worker on IMINCO's small mining team and his loss would
shut down the mine, forcing Fino to pay the ransom demands _
originally as high as $1.5 million and now $612,000.
   The TV station reported that an Ecudoran judge will consider
issuing a warrant for the former employee's arrest Monday.
   Fino's home telephone number was unavailable, and courts in
Ecuador were closed for the weekend.
   ``It does make some sense,'' said Fino's mother, Marie Fino, in
a telephone interview from her home in Warren, Pa. ``Jeff did tell
us he had a problem with a former employee, close to a year ago.
   ``The fellow raided the mining camp and took some equipment when
he left. But I didn't know Jeff was being threatened or
blackmailed,'' Mrs. Fino told The Associated Press.
   Contacted by telephone late Friday, Heimdal's father, Roy
Heimdal, said he was unaware of the latest development.
   ``It was understood by most people that Mr. Fino was the target
of the kidnappers and they got Scott by mistake. That was our
belief from the onset. But we never heard anything like this
before. I don't know what to think,'' Roy Heimdal said.
   With the help of friends and business leaders in Peoria, the
Heimdals raised $60,000 in four days only to learn Wednesday the
kidnappers wanted a total $612,000 to release Heimdal. The $60,000
was simply to keep him alive, the Heimdals were told.
   An undisclosed deadline was set for later this month for the
payment's balance.

<HEAD>Hrawi Rejects Vatican Proposal To Break Peace Pact Deadlock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has rejected a Vatican
proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock in implementing a peace
plan to end the 15-year-old civil war, newspapers said today.
   The Vatican had suggested amending the Arab League peace plan to
make it more acceptable to rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun, who
has refused to recognize President Elias Hrawi's authority, the
newspapers said.
   But Beirut's independent an-Nahar daily said the Vatican
proposal was rejected by Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic, and by Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Parliament Speaker Hussein
Husseini, a Shiite Moslem.
   Also today, police said Aoun's mainly Christian troops and the
rival Lebanese Forces militia led by Christian warlord Samir Geagea
skirmished during the night with machine guns and rocket-propelled
grenades in east Beirut.
   No casualties were reported and the fighting died down at dawn,
police said.
   It was the latest violation of an increasingly fragile month-old
cease-fire mediated by the Vatican to halt the fighting between
Aoun and Geagea, who are locked in a power struggle for control of
the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   By police count, 1,036 people have been killed and 2,774 wounded
since the Aoun-Geagea fighting erupted Jan.30. Their battles have
forced 40 percent of the enclave's 1 million population to flee to
safer areas or leave the country.
   An-Nahar and the leftist Beirut daily, As-Safir, said the
Vatican initiative was relayed to Hrawi's government in Moslem west
Beirut by Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente earlier this week.
   The reports said the Vatican had proposed amending the Arab
League peace plan in return for Aoun's recognizing the Hrawi
government's authority.
   The peace plan was endorsed last October by Lebanon's parliament
at the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif. It calls for the equal
distribution of power between the traditionally dominant Christians
and the majority Moslems.
   Hrawi was elected Nov. 24 with Syrian backing to implement the
pact aimed at ending the bloody many-sided civil war, in which an
estimated 150,000 people have been killed over the past 15 years.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, rejected the peace plan because it
did not contain iron-clad guarantees for the withdrawal of 40,000
Syrian troops from Lebanon. The Syrian troops were deployed under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun considers them an
occupying army.
   Aoun also has refused to allow the Hrawi government to extend
its authority to areas under his control in the Christian enclave.
Hrawi in turn sacked Aoun as army commander and interim premier.

   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
has announced plans to reduce the Nicaraguan army, the largest
force in Central America, by half and retire some senior officers.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who took over after the leftist Sandinistas were
defeated in free elections, said on Friday that the cutbacks would
take effect by Aug. 3.
   Her spokesman, Antonio Lacayo, said the cuts would come mainly
from sending draftees home and reducing the ranks of the militia.
He said the reductions would also affect active-duty troops and
reserve forces.
   Mrs. Chamorro did not say whether the Sandinista army chief,
Gen. Humberto Ortega, would be among those senior officers who
retire under the reforms. She had said earlier that Ortega, brother
of former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega, would hold the post
only temporarily.
   Ortega told reporters later that the army itself will decide
which officers stay and which leave.
   Mrs. Chamorro also said she was ordering the army and the
Interior Ministry to disarm civilians.
   ``It is my purpose that by Christmas there are no weapons in the
hands of anyone unless they are part of the nation's army,'' Mrs.
Chamorro said. She said draftees would be home by Dec. 7.
   The president's announcement came in a speech to the Cabinet,
representatives of the United Nations and the Organization of
American States, the diplomatic corps and the army general staff.
   During the 10 years of Sandinista rule, Nicaragua never made
public the size of the army, but estimates put its strength at near
55,000, making it the largest in Central America.
   Gen. Ortega said on Friday that the army numbered 96,000, but it
was not clear how many of those were active-duty troops and how
many were reservists.
   Lacayo said the army numbered 80,000, including reserves,
militia and draftees, when Mrs. Chamorro took office in April.
   The president said the cutbacks would bring the army strength to
``less than 41,000 men and women,'' adding: ``This means half of
the members that it had on April 25, the day I assumed the
presidency of the republic.''
   Mrs. Chamorro also announced that 14,200 of the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels have demobilized so far. The Contras waged a nearly
decade-long insurgency against the Sandinistas.
   ``With all security we can say that today the war has been left
behind,'' Mrs. Chamorro said. About 1,000 Contras have yet to
demobilize but are expected to do so, she said.
   The measures were announced before Mrs. Chamorro left for a
regional weekend summit in Guatemala, also to be attended by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. It will be Mrs. Chamorro's
first summit as president.
   Mrs. Chamorro later arrived in Guatemala. The summit, which is
taking place in the town of Antigua, 30 miles west of Guatemala
City, is expected to concentrate on efforts to reconstruct the
economies of Nicaragua and other countries in the region.
   She wanted to present the army reduction plan and the Contra
demobilization as evidence that her 7-week-old, U.S. backed
government is fulfilling regional peace pacts entered into by her
predecessor.
   Mrs. Chamorro had ordered Gen. Ortega to present her with a
troop-reduction plan, but she did not say whether the plan she
announced was his.

   A man tossed several firebombs at
motorcycles parked outside a commercial building today, triggering
an explosion and fire that killed 16 people, police and fire
officials said.
   The man, in his twenties, fled immediately after tossing the
firebombs, witnesses told police. There was no explanation for the
incident in downtown Kaohsiung, 215 miles south of Taipei.
   Police said they suspected a gang of arsonists who have been
setting fire to motorcycles parked on the streets of the city in
the past month. No one had been injured in those fires, and the
motive was not known. There have been no arrests.
   Fire Chief Tao Chi-yu said the fire spread quickly through
several floors of the six-story building that housed an all-night
video parlor, trading firms, boutiques and apartments on its top
two floors.
   ``The building was covered in a ball of flame when we rushed to
the scene,'' fireman Chang Chin-hai told reporters.
   Tao said most of the 16 dead were trapped in video screening
rooms on the third and fourth floors, and were burned beyond
recognition. He blamed the high death toll on furniture and other
objects that blocked emergency exits.
   Firemen rescued about 30 people from the building. Police were
searching for the suspect.
   Damage was estimated at $1.8 million.

   East German authorities have captured a
reputed leftist terrorist linked to the 1985 bombing of a U.S. air
base in West Germany and the deaths of three Americans, officials
said today.
   Sigrid Sternebeck, 40, is the seventh alleged member of the
notorious Red Army Faction to be captured in East Germany in the
last 10 days.
   The string of arrests is the result of a recent push by
officials in both German states to locate long-sought terrorist
suspects who received sanctuary under East Germany's former
Communist regime.
   The arrest was reported during the night by East German
authorities through the government news agency, ADN, and confirmed
by West German federal police spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster.
   Ms. Sternebeck is charged with the slaying of U.S. Army soldier
Edward Pimental in Wiesbaden, West Germany on Aug. 8, 1985, said
Foerster.
   Foerster said West Germany would seek the extradition of Ms.
Sternebeck, who is charged in a warrant with murder and attempted
murder. He said she had been a member of the terrorist group since
1977.
   Pimental was killed so terrorists could obtain his identity card
and gain entry by car to the U.S. Air Base at Frankfurt, West
Germany, Foerster said.
   The car was rigged with explosives and detonated near the
headquarters of the base, where it killed two Americans and injured
20.
   The Red Army Faction is blamed for a series of killings and
bombings in West Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. Their targets
included top bankers and industrialists and military facilities and
personnel.
   Ms. Sternebeck is the fifth alleged member of the radical group
arrested in the last two days. Her name is on a list of 30 Red Army
Faction members who are believed to have comprised the core of the
terror group.
   Ms. Sternebeck did not resist when she was arrested in the town
of Schwedt, a district in Frankfurt an der Oder, ADN said.
   The four arrested late Thursday were Monika Helbing, 36, and
Ekkehard von Seckendorff-Gudent, 49, in Frankfurt an der Oder; and
Werner Lotze, 38, and Christine Duemlein, 41, in Cottbus, according
to authorities.
   All had been living in East Germany under assumed names. Ms.
Duemlein and Lotze were married and living in Cottbus under the
names Manfred and Katharina Jansen and had an 8-year-old child.
   Ms. Duemlein was released later because a warrant against her
had expired.
   Seckendorff-Gudent and Ms. Helbing also were married, had a
9-year-old son and were living under the names Horst and Elka
Winter in Cottbus.
   Ms. Helbing and Lotze have been linked to the kidnap-slaying in
1977 of West German industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer and
numerous other terrorist crimes.
   The first of the seven suspects arrested, Susanne Albrecht, told
police she was furnished with a false identity by the former secret
police of the Communist government.
   The West German news magazine Der Spiegel, meanwhile, said one
of the suspects, Seckendorff-Gudent, had served on a local council
set up to help with East Germany's transition to democracy.
   The local ``roundtable'' committees were created after the
hard-line government of Erich Honecker was ousted by mass
demonstrations in October. The councils included intellectuals and
pro-democracy activists.
   Der Spiegel reported that Seckendorff-Gudent, who had been a
physician in West Germany and held the title of baron, served as a
health expert on the Frankfurt an der Oder council.

<TEXT>
   The city's streets were calm for the
first time in four days today after miners went home at the behest
of President-elect Ion Iliescu, who thanked them ``with all my
heart'' for helping put down unrest.
   Iliescu also told the miners he was planning to establish a
national guard to protect the government. He said it would be
composed ``of clean, loyal, honest people, who can act resolutely
at exceptional times.''
   The state news agency Rompres said six people were killed and
502 injured in the violence on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the
worst in Romania since the uprising that toppled Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu in December.
   At least 110 people were still hospitalized, seven of them with
very serious injuries, Rompres quoted Health Ministry officials as
saying.
   The agency quoted railway official Ion Tica as saying the last
train of miners left Bucharest late Friday night for western
Romania.
   The center of the city was quiet as a steady rain poured today.
Helmeted police armed with automatic weapons encircled the square
to prevent new protests, and police reinforcements sat in several
trucks nearby.
   Rows of tanks and tight clusters of soldiers guarded government
headquarters and the state TV station, which came under fierce
attacks on Wednesday night by anti-government demonstrators.
   No miners were visible this morning. But on Friday evening, one
miner said small contingents from each mine would remain in the
capital in case of renewed trouble. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Although isolated groups of miners roamed city streets late
Friday, they appeared to have abandoned earlier tactics of beating
anybody they considered opponents of the government.
   Armed with clubs, iron bars and cudgels, they had swarmed into
Bucharest early Thursday to defend Iliescu, who appealed for help
when demonstrators who demanded that all ex-Communists be banned
from government besieged the Interior Ministry and burned down
police headquarters.
   Western governments condemned the violence.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday that
all but humanitarian aid would be withheld, and the European
Community postponed a trade and economic agreement with Romania.
   Premier Petre Roman told a news conference the miners had been
asked only to restore order on University Square, the center of a
53-day anti-government demonstration that riot police ended
Wednesday by firing on demonstrators.
   Roman said his government deplored all the subsequent violence.
   He also promised negotiations with striking students and
professors at two Bucharest university faculties. The youth daily
Tineretul Liber reported the faculties of physics and architecture
were on strike to protest the brutal attack by pro-Iliescu workers
Thursday.
   Iliescu appeared on state TV Friday night to thank ``with all my
heart'' the miners who came to defend his government against what
he termed a ``fascist'' rebellion.
   He then told them to return home to western Romania, the
country's mining region where Iliescu and his National Salvation
Front have a strong power base. Iliescu won their loyalty by giving
them pay riss and improved working conditions soon after taking
power.
   He also told them he was forming a national guard to protect
Romania from right-wing extremists, whom he charged were aided from
abroad.
   ``We are dealing here with a broader scenario of European
proportions,'' said Iliescu, quoted by BBC monitors from Romanian
radio. ``There was a joint action of right-wing forces, which
started from the presumption that right-wing forces in all east
European countries could come to power.''
   Iliescu and the Front won free elections May 20 by a landslide,
but the opposition distrusts him and other former Communists from
the Ceausescu era. They want them prohibited by law from holding
public office for 10 years.

<HEAD>Lithuania Blockade Eased; Pro-Independence Groups Meet in Latvia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a
fertilizer plant in Lithuania today, easing the blockade on fuel
supplies to the breakaway Baltic republic.
   In neighboring Latvia, leaders of pro-independence fronts from
all three Baltic republics gathered at a resort near the capital,
Riga, to discuss the future of their secessionist movements.
   Officials in Latvia and Lithuania also met separately to discuss
compromises offered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in an
effort to get talks started between the republics and the Kremlin.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were
annexed by the Soviet Union 50 years ago. They have all been
seeking more autonomy, but Lithuania has been the only one of the
three to declare independence.
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas,
said he was told today by a pipeline dispatcher that natural gas
was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas fertilizer
plant in the city of Jonova.
   The move fulfilled a promise made to Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov that 15 percent of the republic's daily natural gas supply
would be restored.
   Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news conference in
Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian
plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration
of the Soviet government's interest in speeding negotiations.''
   More than 26,000 people have been thrown out of work in
Lithuania due to the Kremlin's blockade of all oil, most natural
gas and some raw materials.
   Gorbachev imposed the embargo after the republic refused to
rescind its March 11 declaration of independence.
   Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas
plant would mean that 1,600 laid-off workers _ out of a staff of
4,500 _ should be back at work by the end of next week.
   At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the
popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of
Lithuania opened the second Baltic Assembly.
   ``The participants are assessing their movements' role in
conditions where the fronts' representatives won a majority in
republic parliaments and local councils,'' the Soviet news agency
Tass said.
   Tass said the delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence
movements, also discussed cooperation between the Baltics and other
Soviet republics.
   Speakers at the one-day assembly concluded that prospects for
achieving full independence have grown dramatically over the past
year. They cited the introduction of democratic governments in
Eastern Europe and the reshaping of the Warsaw Pact into a
political alliance, said journalist Alexander Sidyachko, who
attended the meeting.
   He said they adopted a resolution calling on the 35 signatory
nations of the Helsinki Accords to hold a conference on the Baltic
drive for independence.
   The first Baltic Assembly was held in the Estonian capital,
Tallinn, in May of last year.
   In Lithuania, Mrs. Prunskiene and her top ministers discussed a
proposal by Gorbachev, who offered to open talks if implementation
of the republic's independence declaration was frozen, the
unofficial Interfax news agency said.
   The proposal will be discussed by a full session of the Supreme
Council next week, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis was
reported as saying at the Baltic Assembly.
   Latvian ministers also discussed proposals by Gorbachev aimed at
leading toward negotiation on their calls for independence.
   The Latvian leadership concluded that Gorbachev was not specific
enough in his compromise offer, Sidyachko said by telephone from
Riga. However, he quoted legislator Andrei Pantaleyev as saying an
official response to Gorbachev could only be issued by a full
meeting of the republic's Supreme Council.

   Thousands of people jammed a
square in central Amsterdam today to welcome Nelson Mandela, who
told them pressure by ``the masses of the people'' would bring
freedom to South Africa.
   A crowd of up to 10,000 people cheered the black nationalist
leader for 10 minutes, waving African National Congress flags and
``Welcome Mandela!'' banners. Some clambered up onto lampposts for
a better view.
   ``You made it possible for me to be released from prison and to
be able to stand before you today,'' Mandela said, waving his hand
in a clenched-first salute. The Netherlands has been a strong
opponent of white-ruled South Africa's system of apartheid, or
racial segregation.
   Mandela was freed in February after spending more than a
quarter-century in South African jails. His release was part of a
series of reforms by President F.W. de Klerk, including talks with
Mandela's ANC.
   Mandela noted that his Dutch stop coincided with commemorations
in the Netherlands and in South Africa of the June 16, 1976
uprising in the black township of Soweto that killed hundreds of
people.
   ``That is the day on which the South African government decided
to shoot down our children,'' he said.
   ``If you ignore that it is the masses of the people who put
pressure on their governments, we cannot win liberation for our
country.''
   Mandela met earlier today with Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers and
Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek. He told them the 12-nation
European Community should maintain economic sanctions against South
Africa, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   The black leader was also granted an audience by Queen Beatrix,
a rare honor for non-governmental visitors.
   At a news conference in The Hague, Mandela condemned proposals
by de Klerk to give limited veto power to South Africa's white
minority after a formal end to apartheid. He said that would amount
to ``racism through the back door.''
   De Klerk, who opposes a one-man-one-vote system because he
claims it would replace white domination with black domination, has
not disclosed details of his plans for the future.
   Mandela's Dutch stop was announced only last week as an
impromptu addition to a six-week, 13-nation world tour.
   The 71-year-old leader, who recently spent a week in hospital
for bladder surgery, seemed relaxed and alert. A Dutch official
present during the talks with Lubbers said Mandela appeared in good
health.
   Mandela's eight-city U.S. visit begins Wednesday with a
ticker-tape parade in Manhattan and ends with a rally at the
Oakland Coliseum 10 days later.
   Other stops include Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles
and Washington, where Mandela will meet President Bush at the White
House and address a joint session of Congress.

   The government and Tamil rebels today
declared a cease-fire in their 6-day-old battle for control of key
northern and eastern towns that has killed at least 376 people.
   The death toll includes 137 unarmed policemen massacred by the
rebels, have been killed since the previous, 13-month-old
cease-fire broke down Monday. The death toll was compiled from
witnesses, rebels and military sources.
   The government announced the new cease-fire in Colombo after
seven hours of negotiations in Jaffna, the rebels' northern
stronghold. The Tamil Tigers rebel group confirmed the agreement to
reporters in Jaffna, 185 miles northeast of the capital.
   The cease-fire began this evening, but there was no immediate
word on how completely it was observed. The two sides earlier this
week had agreed to stop fighting, but the clashes continued.
   The government communique said both sides had agreed that ``all
the outstanding issues be resolved through negotiations.''
   The rebels had said their chief conditions for restoring the
cease-fire are the withdrawal of all government soldiers and police
from the north and east and the immediate creation of a
Tiger-controlled police force.
   Earlier today, a government negotiator was trapped for about an
hour at the military airport near Jaffna when it came under mortar
fire from the Tigers, government officials said.
   The rebels stopped shelling the airport and the official,
Justice Minister Shahul Hameed, was escorted to Jaffna, 12 miles to
the south, by a rebel leader, said the officials, who cannot be
named under briefing rules.
   The fighting began after a Tamil man told the Tigers he was
assaulted by a Sinhalese policeman on Sunday at a police station in
the east.
   The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland
for the Tamil minority, who say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese majority that controls the government. Tamils, who
are predominantly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18
million people, while the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese account for 75
percent.
   Government troops have recaptured at least seven of the 20
police stations that were overrun by the rebels, the military
officials said. The government also took control of the seaport
town of Trincomalee, they said.
   More than 11,000 people have died in the north and east in the
7-year-old Tamil insurrection.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the Tamil-dominated north and
east after India withdrew its peacekeeping forces in March
following an unsuccessful 32-month mission to disarm the rebels.

<HEAD>End of Barry Era Changing Washington's Political Landscape</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The political landscape that Marion Barry
helped to shape in this city is guaranteed to change as a result of
his decision not to seek a fourth term as mayor.
   Barry's decision, announced at the start of his trial on drug
and perjury charges, closes a chapter that began two decades
earlier.
   Barry worked hard to gain voting rights for residents of the
nation's capital and was rewarded with election twice to the school
board and once to the City Council before winning the mayor's chair
in 1978.
   Barry was considered one of the most promising black politicians
in the country. A veteran of the civil rights movement, he was
working to extend benefits beyond voting rights to those who
elected him.
   Throughout his three terms, his administration has been known
for providing services and opportunities to those he described in
his withdrawal speech as ``the locked out, the shut out.''
   ``He was, by and large, the start of elected politics for
residents of the District of Columbia,'' said local political
analyst Mark Plotkin, a commentator with WAMU-FM.
   But after the mayor publicly abandoned his re-election hopes
last week, attention focused on what will become of Barry and how
far he has fallen.
   The mayor has told aides privately that he would consider
running a city agency for the four years he needs to complete 20
years of government service and qualify for a hefty pension. His
name has also been floated as a possible president for the city-run
University of the District of Columbia.
   But in recent weeks, the mayor has been concentrating more on
the immediate future _ his trial.
   ``Whoever is the next mayor, he'll be talking to them then,''
said one aide. ``He still has some influence, and there are a lot
of things he can do.''
   There has also been talk of drafting a City Council resolution
that would exempt Barry from the last four years he needs for his
pension. And Jesse Jackson and other ministers have announced that
they would establish a fund to ensure Barry's financial well-being.
   On the political front, Barry's withdrawal from the race removes
a long shadow that had settled over the other five candidates.
   ``I've been campaigning 17 hours a day since long before Marion
got in trouble,'' City Council Chairman David Clarke told reporters
Thursday while he distributed leaflets at a subway stop. ``The only
difference today is all the reporters.''
   Most observers say that at-large City Council member John Ray's
campaign is likely to get the biggest boost from Barry's departure.
   ``Ray is viewed as somebody who hasn't beaten up on the mayor,
someone who is also black, someone who is considered the
alternative,'' said Plotkin. ``No one is going to get the lion's
share of Barry's voters, but Ray will get his portion, which will
cushion his current total.''
   A Washington Post poll conducted in May showed that with Barry
in the race, the mayor and Ray led the field, each with 23 percent
of the vote. The poll showed that Ray's support would climb to 29
percent if Barry stayed out of the September primary.
   Barry's decision to drop out only intensifies the jockeying that
began soon after he was arrested in an FBI sting last January.
   In March, civil rights veteran Walter E. Fauntroy announced that
he was giving up his nonvoting House seat after 19 years to run for
mayor. That touched off a scramble for Fauntroy's job, with civil
rights attorney Eleanor Holmes Norton and city council member Betty
Ann Kane now leading a crowded field of five candidates.
   Still others are now vying for the seats of council members who
have jumped into the mayor's race.
   ``Many of them were in the race already, but Barry's problems
guarantee political change here,'' Plotkin said. ``Things will be
quite different now _ that's undeniable.''

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Mielke ran his secret empire from a
musty, dimly lighted office in a huge complex of buildings on the
outskirts of East Berlin.
   When he was forced to give up his post as chief of the East
German secret police, he left behind an empty safe, a new paper
shredder and a poorly rendered painting of the Berlin Wall.
   He left an open jar of fruit juice in the refigerator, a box of
uniforms from the Communist youth group in a closet and a personal
switchboard where he could reach his security chiefs anywhere in
the world.
   As almost every East German knows, Mielke also left behind a
vast army of secret police and 6 million clandestine files, a
seemingly bottomless well of information ranging from the mundane
to the potentially explosive.
   The secret security police organization no longer exists.
Mielke, 82, is hospitalized and reportedly suffering from senility.
The new government is trying to decide what to do with the
employees, the buildings and the millions of files.
   To many East Germans, the files are a Pandora's box of paranoia
that can both ruin lives or expose collaborators of the old regime.
   To Western intelligence agencies, they are a potential gold mine
of information about the former government's espionage activities
abroad and its reputed role in training or harboring international
terrorists.
   ``They are very important,'' said George Carver, a former CIA
station chief in Bonn, West Germany. ``The East Germans ran a very
efficient police state and had one of the best intelligence
services in the world,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
   East German authorities in the past two weeks arrested several
reputed members of West Germany's leftist Red Army Faction, which
has been blamed for a string of killings and bombings during the
past two decades.
   All had been among the most wanted people in West German
history, and all had been living quietly in East Germany apparently
with the knowledge and help of the former secret police.
   One, Susanne Albrecht, said she had been granted asylum by the
secret police and furnished with a new identity.
   Another, Inge Viett, 46, was known to be living in East Germany
as far back as 1986.
   ``The East Germans were used to train security services around
the world,'' said Carver. ``They were very involved in allowing
terrorists to stay in East Germany. If that is with foundation, it
should be made public.''
   Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel of East Germany, who
oversees police functions in East Germany, said he would ``clear up
as much as possible this diabolical connection between the Ministry
for State Security and the terror scene.''
   But Diestel has come under fire for employing more than 2,000
members of the former secret police, known as the Stasi.
   Stasi employees still work at the vast main headquarters in
Berlin, and many are in the police department.
   ``They are still around and I do not know why. I see the same
people drinking in the same bars,'' said East Berliner Helmut
Frankan, 66, who said his restaurant was closed by the secret
police because too many young people frequented it.
   Thousands of others are unemployed and drawing jobless benefits
or pensions.
   Many former East German agents were believed to have been
recruited both by Soviet and Western intelligence agencies after
the pro-democracy revolt.
   Hans Gert Lange, a spokesman for West German
counter-intelligence agency, said there was a sharp rise in
defections from East Germany after the old hard-line regime was
thrown out last autumn. ``A lot, I would say,'' he said.
   About 85,000 people were employed by the Stasi, from file clerks
to surveillance experts, and another 109,000 _ ranging from
teachers to travel agents _ had informal secret police duties.
   Hotels that catered to foreign visitors were known to be havens
for Stasi agents, who worked behind counters and carried luggage.
   After the former government of hard-liner Erich Honecker was
toppled last autumn, a caretaker Communist government appointed a
committee and a team of government officials to disband the Stasi
and catalog the files and its vast properties.
   After the current government was elected, that committee was
replaced by a new one that is to recommend to the government how to
finally dismantle the once-fearsome apparatus and, perhaps most
importantly, what to do with the closely guarded files.
   Several members of Parliament have been accused of working for
the secret police, and two prominent politicians resigned earlier
this year amid the allegations.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere has denied similiar
accusations that he was a secret police informant.
   Albrecht Dauer, a former member of the citizens' committee, said
virtually all 400 Parliament members have looked at their Stasi
files.
   Many East Germans have intense hatred for the sprawling network
that followed, bugged, intimidated, interrogated and often
imprisoned dissidents.
   A Stasi file from last year on an East German environmental
group includes detailed lists of meetings, members and even the
name of the pastor of the church where it met.
   It refers to the group's ``hostile and negative activities.''
   Ex-CIA man Carver said East Germany should conduct a
case-by-case analysis of the Stasi files and remove any elected
official who was found to have collaborated.
   Eberhard Schultz, a foreign policy specialist for the German
Society for Foreign Politics, a Bonn-based think tank, said it
would be dangerous to rely on the files.
   A file may indicate a person was targeted for recruitment as an
informer, but never say if that person refused, he said.
   ``His reputation would be ruined if it becomes public,'' he said.
   Schultz said virtually everyone at East German universities who
had the freedom to travel abroad was expected to report back to the
Stasi on the contacts they made.
   ``Do you fire all the teachers?'' he said.

   More than 1 million divorced and widowed
fathers are on the ``daddy track,'' learning to balance children,
housework, social life and career as a single parent.
   Their numbers are growing and are expected to continue rising as
more fathers seek custody and courts become more inclined to go
along.
   Like single mothers, these men are discovering there are
pitfalls in raising kids alone. But their problems often are
different.
   Single fathers usually are better off financially than single
mothers. On the other hand, people tend to treat men differently
than their female counterparts.
   From the sales clerk to the next-door neighbor, people often
react by heaping assistance on these single-parent fathers,
offering help with child care, cooking, cleaning and shopping, says
Geoffrey L. Greif, an associate professor at the University of
Maryland's Baltimore School of Social Work.
   The result, Greif says, is that many of these fathers get
conflicting messages.
   ``They are praised for what they are doing ... but on the other
hand they are offered a helping hand,'' he said in an interview
last week. ``People think they are incompetent to do it by
themselves. It's a funny position that these men are put in, being
praised and insulted.''
   Psychologically, the adjustments are different also.
   ``When men gain custody, they often feel like freaks, like there
aren't any other people out there doing it,'' Greif said.
   Greif, who profiles single fathers in a new book, said a father
once asked him ``How many other freaks are there like me?''
   ``The impression is that they are doing something that is
strange, and some men interpret that to mean they are doing
something that isn't masculine, and that takes a toll that's harder
to measure and harder to see.
   ``It tends to isolate some of the fathers ... (and) in a society
that believes women should be the ones raising children, it has the
potential for hindering the self-esteem of the children,'' he said.
   Using a survey of more than 1,100 single fathers with custody
and interviews with dozens of others, Greif crafted a profile of
these men for his book, ``The Daddy Track and the Single Parent.''
   The book debunks many of the myths of single fathering,
including popular notions of men foundering in the kitchen and
chaotically coping with the daily chores.
   In fact, one of the biggest trouble areas for single fathers,
like single mothers, is balancing work and child rearing.
   Greif said some of the fathers he interviewed had to quit their
jobs and some were fired, but most often the problem was a
frustrating halt to their rise up the career ladder.
   ``Men in our society define themselves as males based in large
part on their success at work, so when you place a man on this
track ... he sometimes has to make a choice between pursuing his
career path or putting his career on hold,'' Greif said.
   Single-parenting often limits an employee's ability to travel on
short notice, which can hinder their chances for promotion. ``Some
men feel they are being passed over,'' he said.
   Housekeeping and child care are easier problems to overcome,
Greif found. After the first few months on their own, most men had
these areas under control, and generally their relationships with
their children were positive, he said.
   In 1988, about 1.2 million divorced and widowed fathers were
raising their children, compared with 8.1 million single-parent
mothers, according to the Census Bureau.
   But the ranks of these fathers are growing _ by more than 50
percent compared with 16 percent for single-parent mothers in the
first seven years of the 1980s, Greif said.
   The jury is still out on whether children fare better with their
mother or father, ``but generally the outcome seems to be the
same,'' he said.
   Greif concludes that in general men find single-parenting much
more difficult than they thought it would be, ``but very few say
they regret the choice.''

<HEAD>VA Decision Due Soon on Revising Service-Connected Disabilities
List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veteran Affairs Department will reveal
later this month whether it plans to limit compensation to veterans
who suffered disabling injuries or illnesses while in uniform.
   The announcement, one of several changes resulting from a
yearlong, in-house study of medical and compensation programs, is
bound to add to the aggravation of groups such as the Disabled
American Veterans and American Legion.
   The veterans organizations have been highly suspicious of the
VA's internal deliberations, especially the review of
service-connected benefits.
   The Disabled American Veterans last February forced the VA to
acknowledge it had been conducting the review. The group recently
sent out a recruiting letter that began with the word ``Betrayal!''
   An American Legion official, John F. Sommer, said VA studies
``should be done in a way that people are aware of what is being
looked at.''
   The secrecy fueled a widespread fear that the White House was
targeting veterans' programs for budget cuts.
   Veterans receive monthly payments of $76 to $1,500, depending on
disability, for injuries or illnesses that occurred during active
service. The only exception is for reckless behavior. Spouses or
dependents also can receive payments.
   Some 2.8 million veterans, along with 900,000 surviving spouses
and other dependents, receive more than $16 billion yearly in VA
benefits.
   The VA insists it will not try to reduce benefits for people
already receiving them. And Congress would have to approve most
changes.
   The VA argues that disabilities or deaths should be directly
related injuries or diseases that occur as a result of job duties.
   The VA and others question whether an after-hours sports injury
should be compensable. More importantly, they question automatic
compensation for heart disease, diabetes, chronic bronchitis,
arthritis, hemorrhoids and multiple sclerosis _ diseases that may
be brought on by heredity, bad habits or age.
   A General Accounting Office report last year said the government
paid $1.7 billion to veterans with those and related diseases in
1986.
   These diseases are compensable if they become manifest during
service or within a year after a person leaves the military, some
within a longer period afterward.
   ``It's a philosophical issue,'' said Deputy VA Secretary Anthony
J. Principi, who is leading the study.
   Veterans groups argue that there are no after hours in the armed
services, and that is the reason behind the automatic presumption
of service connection.
   ``You can't compare it to being in a civilian job,'' said
Sommer. Soldiers, sailors and fliers live under constant alert,
risk and stress regardless of what they might be doing at a given
moment, he argues.

<HEAD>French Commemorate Charles De Gaulle's Call To Arms Against Nazis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French are celebrating with unprecedented
fanfare the 50th anniversary of Charles De Gaulle's historic appeal
for armed resistance against Nazi tyranny.
   Yet few people actually heard the radio broadcast, and many
French people _ though they might deny it now _ were content with
the leaders who had just surrendered to Hitler.
   Known as the ``appel'' of June 18, De Gaulle's fervent,
four-minute speech was addressed to soldiers and civilians in
England and France.
   In a deep, gravelly voice edged with tension, he asked: ``Must
we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... France is not
alone! ... The flame of French resistance must not and shall not
die!''
   But the army was in disarray, and most civilians were fleeing
their homes. The chaos and panic were such that 90,000 families
reported having lost children during the mass exodus.
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the BBC on their wartime
wireless radios sought assurances from 84-year-old Philippe Petain,
a bemedalled World War I field marshal who had urged Premier Paul
Reynaud to sign the armistice the previous day.
   Regis Debray, a former adviser to President Francois Mitterrand,
has suggested in a recent book that in June 1940, nine out of 10
French supported Petain. In fact, by the end of the summer, only
7,000 people had reached De Gaulle's London headquarters.
   The vast majority of the French saw De Gaulle as a brash rebel
who fled his native soil hours after France capitulated _ to join
forces with an old enemy, England.
   By contrast, the grandfatherly, taciturn Petain, known as ``the
hero of Verdun,'' urged an end to the conflict, which he believed
France could never win.
   Petain's popularity began to fade only after Vichy-led police
zealously rounded up Jews for deportation to concentration camps _
123,000 died _ and began sending French workers to Germany.
   Fifty years later, the French are celebrating their national
hero unreservedly _ with virtually no reminders of the
collaborationist regime or tolerance of Nazism that De Gaulle
vigorously condemned.
   Instead, politicians try to capitalize on his legacy, each vying
to appear as his heir.
   Sound and light extravaganzas will re-enact the dramatic moments
of the war, including the Nazi invasion, the June 18 appeal and the
liberation.
   Paris has been plastered with 6,000 posters recalling the
highlights of De Gaulle's career. Art exhibitions, documentaries
and television specials _ even a computer game _ recapture the
grandeur and charisma of ``le General.''
   A giant replica of the wireless _ the kind that ordinary
citizens would later risk their lives listening to _ will be
erected at the Place de la Concorde and will broadcast De Gaulle's
wartime speeches from dawn to dusk on June 18.
   Retired Gen. Andre Delpech, a resistance fighter who was
tortured and sent to Dachau in 1944, remembers the excitement of
the June 18 appeal. He was then 15.
   ``Somehow, news had reached our remote hamlet that some general,
whose name we didn't know, was going to make an important speech
from London. We could barely make out his voice... Afterwards, the
adults stayed up long into the night discussing the few sentences
they managed to decipher.''
   Meanwhile, radio announcers reread the appeal during the evening
and into the wee hours of the morning. The following day De Gaulle
again took the microphone to express his firm belief that he
``spoke in the name of France.''
   ``Ici Londres'' _ ``This is London'' _ became a codeword for the
resistance, opening nightly broadcasts that provided news from the
free world and transmitted coded messages to underground networks
in France.
   Political journalist Robert Quiriconi was a high school student
in Algeria when De Gaulle founded the Free French movement and
hoisted the French tricolor over his London home.
   ``At flag-raising ceremonies, we were supposed to sing a song
praising Petain instead of the `Marseillaise,''' he said. ``I had
heard about De Gaulle from my classmates, and from then on, we were
Gaullists, and refused to sing.''

   Big-city mayors are leading an effort to pressure
the federal government to increase spending on drug, poverty,
housing and other urban problems.
   The mayors opened their annual summer meeting Friday by
denouncing the 1980s as ``a decade of neglect of America's cities''
and attacking Congress and the White House for spending billions on
foreign aid, the savings and loan bailout and other programs while
cutting aid to cities.
   ``We have to do something,'' San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor
said in urging fellow mayors to be more militant in their lobbying
of Congress and the Bush administration. ``Our pleas have been
falling on deaf ears.''
   The host mayor for U.S. Conference of Mayors session, Chicago's
Richard M. Daley, chastised administration officials _ drug czar
William Bennett for one _ who have accused the mayors of whining in
asking for more federal help.
   ``I don't think we're whining. I don't think we're crying,''
Daley said. ``They've become isolated from the country.''
   This morning, Daley led more than 100 mayors in his city's third
annual ``Say No To Drugs'' parade. More than 100 bands, one from as
far away as Texas, joined the mayors in the parade.
   The opening day of the six-day meeting featured a rally-style
joint gathering of conference task forces on drugs and
homelessness. Several mayors warned that festering racial and
ethnic tensions in major cities could explode unless city and
federal governments work together to address housing needs and
poverty, which the mayors blamed for exacerbating drug use and
violence.
   ``If we wait until there is a crisis it will be too late,'' said
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode. ``We have the opportunity to
deal with it before it gets out of hand.''
   Friday's opening session was full of anti-Washington rhetoric
but short on specific solutions. The chairman of the session,
Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, said he wanted an open discussion of
urban problems from which the mayors could draft proposed policy
statements for the conference to consider next week.
   Flynn opened the session with a scathing attack on federal
spending priorities.
   ``Federal policy towards our cities and towards economic
opportunity today is as bankrupt as the corrupt savings and loans
which are robbing our young people's future,'' he said.
   ``While we waited at Washington's back door for a few crumbs for
urban America, these bandits heisted over $300 billion from our
nation's treasury,'' Flynn said.
   ``These are funds that could have been used for job training,
for college scholarships, for helping young families buy their
first home, as well as building a national economy set to compete
with Europe and Japan.''
   Flynn, chairman of the task force on homelessness, was among
mayors blaming federal aid cutbacks they said have left cities too
poor to provide job training to keep youths off streets and away
from crime. The mayors hope to lobby collectively for money they
believe can be saved from a reduced need for military spending.
   The mayors are expected to request that more anti-drug money go
directly to cities instead of states. But the National Governors
Association said in a letter to the mayors made public Friday that
it favored the current system, under which states can award grants
to cities but have latitude in spending the federal money.

   Few men could have felt as utterly alone as
Charles De Gaulle on the evening of June 18, 1940.
   As the tall, uniformed French general strode into the London
studios of the BBC to make his first broadcast to France, his
country was collapsing under the German blitzkrieg. Its government
was suing for peace. A shellshocked populace was resigned to defeat.
   De Gaulle's gamble seemed a pathetic exercise in self-delusion.
At 49, virtually unknown outside military circles, he lacked
troops, guns, money and friends. The collaborationist French
government would shortly sentence him to death.
   De Gaulle wrote later that he felt like the survivor of a
shipwreck, ``a man on the shore of an ocean, proposing to swim
across.''
   Fifty years later, De Gaulle's broadcast is a hallowed memory
for France, a symbol of defiance against all odds. But in 1940,
there was no rush to his banner.
   De Gaulle had led his tanks gallantly against the German
onslaught and remained in France until June 17, leaving for England
only when defeat became inevitable.
   The British had hoped leading politicians would come to carry on
the fight, and Winston Churchill was disappointed that no one more
senior than De Gaulle showed up.
   But the British prime minister immediately recognized the
general as a comrade. De Gaulle correctly predicted the Americans
and Soviets would join the war and that Hitler would go down in
five years.
   That kind of fighting talk appealed to Churchill. ``You are
alone. Well, I shall recognize you alone,'' he told De Gaulle on
June 27.
   The relationship between the two titans soon faltered. De
Gaulle, an instinctive Anglophobe, showed his hosts little
gratitude.
   He could be breathtakingly arrogant. Petty setbacks sent him
into rages. Leonard Miall, a BBC editor, remembers De Gaulle's fury
because his June 18 broadcast was not recorded for posterity.
   The BBC's equipment was needed that day to record Churchill's
``This was their finest hour'' speech, but De Gaulle wasn't
interested in excuses.
   ``He tore strips off the BBC in general and me in particular for
failing to appreciate the historical importance of the occasion,''
Miall said in an interview. ``I had never encountered such an angry
man.''
   Churchill complained of De Gaulle's ``insufferable rudeness.''
The Americans felt the same. Franklin D. Roosevelt mocked the
general's pretensions. Dwight D. Eisenhower couldn't stand him.
   Mary Borden, an English novelist who knew De Gaulle, wrote
understandingly: ``To come to the British as a suppliant, with the
disgrace of his nation burned on his forehead and in his heart, was
intolerable. But he could look to no one else; his own people
failed him; the French officials reviled or snubbed him; the troops
turned their back on him; the response to his appeal was pitiable.
The weaker his position, the more arrogant he became.''
   Driven by a mystical faith in France's greatness, De Gaulle was
loftily unrepentant.
   ``I shall yield nothing of the elements which make up that
greatness,'' he told a visitor in London. ``The weaker I am, the
more intransigent I shall be in defending our rights.''
   As the Allies gained the upper hand, De Gaulle's Free French
army swelled, and when France was chosen for the Allied invasion of
Europe, the general and his army assumed greater importance.
   De Gaulle's war was an epic human drama. Its repercussions,
reflected in his bouts of hostility toward Britain and the United
States, lasted through his decade as president of France until his
death in 1970.
   Militarily, his role in World War II was not crucial. But his
primary goal in London was to ``pick up the broken sword'' and
transform France from humiliated collaborator to victorious ally.
   In that, the lonely, cantankerous, courageous visionary
triumphed utterly.

   The miner scrambled on all fours
through mud along Shaft No. 6 in the Red Star mine, cursing as he
knocked loose a support.
   His helmet lamp bobbed in the gloom as he jammed the metal jack
back under rough-cut ceiling beams in the low tunnel in the heart
of the Donetsk Basin, the largest Soviet coal field.
   The miners more than a quarter-mile beneath Makeyevka were
smeared with black mud, their clothes soaked with water, their
lungs tormented with sickness and their hearts full of bitterness
toward the Communist Party and government.
   A half-dozen miners lay down their tools to speak to an American
correspondent who had crawled 500 feet along a low tunnel to talk
with them and see their working conditions.
   ``This is how we work,'' said a miner named Alexander, lying on
his side, using a broad-bladed shovel to ladle lumps of hard coal
onto a conveyer belt, driven by chains that roared a few inches
from his nose.
   A co-worker named Sergei lifted a drill and long bit to show how
he chipped away coal. He was stooped over, unable to sit upright in
the cramped tunnel. Both miners identified themselves only by first
names.
   Nine miles to the west of the Red Star lode, the First Congress
of Soviet Miners passed resolutions of no confidence in the party
and threatened to strike July 11 if Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov's government does not resign.
   Another resolution expressed no confidence in the Communist
Party, presenting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev _ also the party
general Secretary _ with one of his toughest tests yet in
maintaining popular support.
   Last summer, half of the nation's 1 million miners sent a
similar shock through the Soviet Union by striking for safer
working conditions, better housing and increased deliveries of meat
and soap. Miners also demanded a greater voice in setting prices
and production quotas.
   The miners say the government hasn't delivered, and they have
lost faith in the party.
   The miners meeting decided to reconvene in August to form the
first independent nationally organized union since the days of
Lenin.
   Down in the Red Star mine, the workers said new unions were
needed.
   ``None of us are party members down here,'' Sergei said. ``I
don't know whether there will be a strike, but I'll take part if
there is one.''
   ``Food is the most important thing. Meat,'' Alexander said.
   As the reporter crawled away, a pneumatic hose burst underneath
him, hissing filled the air and a miner rushed to fix it.
   ``Don't worry. It's nothing,'' said Igor N. Shapovalov, deputy
chief engineer at the mine.
   Shapovalov, 29, says he'll remain in the Communist Party despite
its unpopularity among the miners and the likelihood that it will
split at a party meeting next month.
   Despite his loyalty, Shapovalov said he supported the strike
last year, and he acknowledges that conditions in the mines are
poor.
   ``Imagine. They sit in that water for six hours a day, in that
moisture. They get sick all the time,'' said Shapovalov.
   During the tour, he pointed out an improperly prepared cable
used to haul trains along mine tunnels.
   ``This should have a sheath,'' he said gesturing at an exposed
cable loop that had not yet begun to fray.
   ``And this should have a clasp,'' he said, pointing at the knot
that completed the loop. ``This could give way while miners were in
the train, and they could get hurt.''
   He also demonstrated a gas meter, designed to detect dangerous
concentrations of methane.
   Pockets of methane explode. Within the last two weeks, gas
explosions have killed six miners in Donetsk and 12 in the Kuznetsk
Coal Basin in western Siberia.
   In the last five months, 33 Soviet miners have perished, the
newspaper Trud reported Saturday. The death toll in both 1988 and
1989 was 93.
   On Friday, John J. Banovic, international secretary-treasurer of
the United Mines Workers of America, told the miners' meeting that
his union would help them found an independent union and work to
improve conditions.
   Listening to a description of the Red Star mine, he said: ``It
sounds like late 18th century or early 19th century mining to me.
We'd close down a mine like that straight away.''
   Shapovalov, a blond 6-footer, acknowledged his mine might close
if the government moves from a planned to a market economy.
   ``If this mine closes, I'll find other work. We defeated the
Fascists. We can live through this,'' he said, evoking memories of
World War II, when the choices facing Soviet workers seemed much
simpler.

   Guy Paulin, a French ready-to-wear creator who
gained prominence in the 1970s, has died, associates in the fashion
world said Saturday. He was 44.
   Paulin died early Thursday of an AIDS-related illness, they said.
   A top stylist of the 1970s, Paulin stood out for his original
fishnet knitwear. His designs also featured bias cuts in silk and
cotton jerseys and soft and subtle shapes and colors.
   Born in the Lorraine region of eastern France, he begain his
fashion career at the Printemps department store at age 17,
starting as a salesman and later becoming a buyer.
   He then branched off into designing ready-to-wear, working first
as an assistant for Dorothee Bis as well as with a group called
Paraphernalia, which included British designer Mary Quant and
Emmanuelle Khanh, a French ready-to-wear creator.
   Paulin introduced a collection under his own name in the early
1980s before a brief stint at the luxury ready-to-wear house Chloe
in 1983 when designer Karl Lagerfeld left to work for Chanel.
   Paulin started up his own label again in 1986, producing his
last collection in October 1989.

<HEAD>Congressional Debate Highlights East vs. West Mentality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rudyard Kipling meant the world and not
Congress when he wrote that ``East is East and West is West,'' but
debate last week on Capitol Hill showed that the twain have a hard
time meeting here.
   On the House and Senate floor, Western lawmakers complained
about being misunderstood by their colleagues from the East. The
legislative battles, naturally enough, were over land, timber,
water and minerals _ exploitation versus preservation.
   In the Senate the debate was over the Tongass National Forest,
which covers an area of Alaska that is larger than West Virginia.
In the House, the debate was over irrigating vast farms.
   ``It is very difficult for a senator from Ohio to understand
what it is like to be a public land state,'' Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, said during debate on the environmentalist-backed Tongass
bill, which would restrict logging in the temperate rain forest.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a Cleveland Democrat, had just finished
arguing against an amendment that would have had the government
trade away mineral rights without knowing their true value.
   Garn said he wished that two-thirds of Ohio was owned by the
federal government ``so that I could stand up here and talk about
... what the county commissioners would do if they only had
one-third of the land to tax, and the mayors, the city councils,
the governor, and how you provide roads, police and fire protection
without that tax revenue.''
   Garn argued that the mining corporations, like Kennecott in his
home state, provide the tax base to compensate for having only 4
percent private land in some counties. Kennecott is one of the
companies that extract silver and gold from an existing mine in
Tongass and would profit from the land trade, which has been put in
the abeyance even though the overall Tongass bill was approved 99-0.
   Alaska's senators, Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski, supported
the bill because it restricted logging less than a House-passed
version would. Both argued that although old-growth timber needs to
be preserved, so does an industry that sustains 25 percent of the
economy in the state's southeast.
   Acknowledging that he had gone off the subject of the amendment
being debated, Garn said other Western states had high percentages
of publicly held land. Alaska is 90 percent, he said.
   In the House the next day, Rep. Robert F. Smith, R-Ore.,
complained about legislation by Connecticut Democrat Sam Gejdenson
to make farmers chose between crop subsidies or subsidized water.
   ``The gentleman argues that there is something uniquely wrong
about receiving reclamation water and farm program benefits,''
Smith said, arguing that the 1902 act that set up water reclamation
projects was intended to promote permanent Western settlement.
   ``And I would suggest that if it is the gentleman from
Connecticut's intention to highlight federal spending _ and
wasteful federal spending at that _ he might look in his own
backyard.''
   Smith said reclamation projects in Oregon account for far less
than the billions spent by the government to build submarines and
helicopters in Connecticut, the fifth-largest recipient per capita
of defense dollars.
   The Gejdenson measure passed, 338-55.

   Japan is proposing a $10.8 billion project to help
stop the advance of the southern Sahara Desert, an official said
Saturday.
   Under the 30-year plan announced by Japan's Forestry Agency, a
2,100-mile ``greenery defense belt'' of trees would be planted
along the Niger River from Lake Chad in the east to River Senegal
in the west to block the southward advance of the Sahara Desert.
   The official cited a U.S. study saying the sub-Saharan desert is
spreading southward at six to 18 miles a year.
   The nine-nation project also calls for agricultural development
to boost food production, according to the official.
   The Japanese agency plans to send a mission to Niger next month
to conduct a survey of forestation and irrigation, the official
said.

   A sharp earthquake rattled western Greece
on Saturday, injuring one person, damaging buildings and disrupting
electricity and telephone services.
   The quake registered 5.1 on the Richter scale and its epicenter
was 190 miles northwest of Athens, just offshore from the harbor
town of Preveza, a spokesman for the Athens Geodynamic Institute
said.
   A police spokesman in Preveza said a 78-year-old woman was
slightly injured in the nearby village of Riza when her house
collapsed.
   The spokesman said another seven houses in the region collapsed
and 360 were slightly damaged. Telephone lines and electricity
supplies were disrupted for a few hours, he said, speaking by
telephone.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.

   The Supreme Court today denied an application
to stay the execution of John Edward Swindler, who was scheduled to
be put to death Monday night for the 1976 murder of a Fort Smith,
Ark., police officer.
   Swindler, 46, would be the first person executed in Arkansas in
26 years.
   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said the court denied the
stay at 11:50 a.m. EDT. She said Justices William Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   Attorneys for Swindler appealed to the Supreme Court on Friday,
after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis turned
down Swindler's application for a stay Thursday, the same day Gov.
Bill Clinton rejected Swindler's application for executive clemency.
   Swindler, who is from South Carolina, has been on death row for
14 years.
   Charles Franklin Fields was the last prisoner put to death in
Arkansas. He was electrocuted in 1964.

<HEAD>Reform Group Debates Split in Communist Party</HEAD>

   Hundreds of reform-minded Communist Party members
gathered Saturday to debate when and how to break away from the
party and form an opposition group.
   One leader of the Democratic Platform movement argued for an
immediate break, saying that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
would not be able to reform the Communist Party enough at a coming
party meeting to avoid a split.
   ``The Communist Party cannot be reformed, cannot be
transformed,'' said Igor B. Chubais, a philosopher and one of the
leaders of Democratic Platform.
   Democratic Platform, founded about six months ago, has counted
among its members Boris N. Yeltsin, recently elected president of
the Russian republic; and the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad _
Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak.
   But those leaders reduced their activities in the reform group
when they took on government responsibilities.
   The movement now is split on whether it should found a new party
immediately and take hundreds of thousands of the Communist Party's
18 million members with them, or wait until after a national party
congress that begins July 2.
   The nationwide gathering of Democratic Platform members is to
decide that question before it wraps up its conference Sunday.
   Any split in the party would be the first since the time of
Lenin.
   Although Chubais argued for an immediate break, others urged
caution.
   Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's Higher Party
School, urged that the reformers wait until after the party
congress when, he said, the party's inability to reform will be
even clearer.
   To move too quickly would risk worsening the country's tense
political situation, he said.
   ``If we appraise things in a sober manner, we can see we are
moving towards, and can quickly find ourselves again under an
authoritarian regime,'' Shostakovsky said. ``We are sliding down to
it.''
   Democratic Platform demands the Communist Party eliminate its
chapters in enterprises, the KGB and the police. It wants the
Communist Party to transform itself into a parliamentary group that
struggles with others for political power.
   Shostakovsky has said that Democratic Platform probably could
count on taking a half-million supporters out of the party if it
breaks away.
   That would make it the largest single opposition group, but
still much smaller and weaker than the Communist Party.
   Many other alternative parties have been formed since the
Communists gave up their constitutional monopoly on power in the
spring, but the overwhelming size and resources of the Communist
Party have prevented a genuine multiparty system from developing.
   Speakers on Saturday called for Democratic Platform to reach out
to the recently formed Social Democratic and Democratic parties of
Russia to form a movement against the Communist Party.
   Surveys taken by Shostakovsky's institute from January through
May indicate that more than 40 percent of Soviet Communists support
Democratic Platform, compared to only about 20 percent for their
national leadership.
   But in documents released at the meeting, the school warned that
Democratic Platform's support is soft.
   ``A significant number of party members, regarding Democratic
Platform with approval, don't share many of its ideas, but only
support the fact that an alternative movement has sprung up in the
Soviet Communist Party,'' it said.

<HEAD>Father's Group `DAD' Gives Kids Alternatives to Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE M. PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whipped cream, squirt guns and balloons may
not seem like conventional weapons in the war against drugs, but
they are an important part of a New Hampshire psychologist's
arsenal.
   Lee Wotherspoon approaches the battle against addiction with his
own army: a group called DAD, or Drugs Are Dangerous.
   The organization's mission is to show young people how to have
fun without drugs, and to encourage fathers to get involved in
their children's lives.
   Wotherspoon co-founded DAD with Ed Ahlman of Kingston, whose son
Chris committed suicide in 1988. Wotherspoon had counseled Chris,
who was addicted to drugs, before his death.
   ``We got together to decide what we could do about the problems
facing kids, especially drugs,'' Ahlman said, adding that the group
currently has hundreds of members in New England.
   ``The deficit is for fathers. Women are out there wanting to do
whatever they can to help their kids and feeling torn when they're
struggling between work and family and children,'' Wotherspoon
said. ``The fathers forget. They need to have it pulled together
for them.''
   DAD sponsors, among other things, ``Natural High'' parties,
which feature activities such as squirt gun fights, whipped cream
battles, balloon volleyball and limbo contests in the mud. Fathers
are encouraged to bring their children to the free events and join
in the fun.
   ``I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, and if I'm
going to have a party, I don't want to have a party where people
stand around and wonder when the next drink is going to be served
and talk small talk,'' Wotherspoon said. ``That's boring to me. If
I'm going to do one, let's have fun with it.''
   Lori Knight, 17, a student from Kingston, is a veteran of
several Natural High parties.
   ``I think when kids go to the parties they think of the positive
things that they can do instead of drugs, and the fun times they
can have,'' she said.
   Apart from the Natural High parties, DAD also sponsors support
groups and a help-line and provides ``tool kits,'' packages of
advice that help fathers deal with children's problems.
   Wotherspoon said it's important not only to give kids
alternatives to drugs, but to start driving the message home early.
   ``We can't wait until our kid's lives get burned to throw foam
on the fire. We need a fire prevention program. And that's what DAD
tries to do,'' he said.
   ``I'm giving kids an anti-addiction message at these parties,
but it's not preaching at them. It's showing them, giving them an
experience, of what it's like to get a natural high. But I'm also
showing them _ hey, you can play life for higher stakes.''
   Wotherspoon's idea for drug-free fun has counterparts across the
country. In Bowling Green, Ohio, a group called PARTY, for
Promoting Awareness Toward Yourself, uses Wotherspoon's principles.
   In the Midwest, a group called Mad Dads Inc., or Men Against
Destruction Defending against Drugs and Social Disorder, has taken
a more militant stance. The group has chapters in Omaha and Grand
Island, Neb., and in Denver.
   Mad Dads patrols neighborhoods infested by drug-dealers and
gangs in an effort to drive them out, and paints over gang
graffiti. They also sponsor parties free of drugs and alcohol for
teen-agers.
   ``We touch people that other social programs have overlooked,''
said Ellis Edwards, a spokesman for the group.
   Edwards said Mad Dads also provides a surrogate father program.
   ``Most of our members are fathers, but we all also act as
surrogate fathers for youth on the street, kids who have come from
broken homes, or who don't have the guidance they need in life,''
Edwards said.
   Currently, Wotherspoon travels across the country helping groups
organize their own Natural High events. He said he has sponsored
parties at colleges and universities, where he says the principle
of fun tends to work just as well with more sophisticated groups.
   The idea, however, is to catch kids at a young age to
``immunize'' them against a future of drugs, and the best way to do
that is positive reinforcement.
   ``Some seeds die and some seeds grow. Some take root and become
fine, big trees,'' he said. ``The best we can do is try and help
that. If you want a good garden, don't water the weeds.''

<HEAD>Abu Nidal Group Official Killed in Shootout in South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the radical Palestinian
group led by terrorist Abu Nidal was killed Saturday during machine
gun exchanges with rival Palestinain fighters at a refugee camp
near Tyre.
   Police said Omar Hamadeh, Tyre regional commander of Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, was killed in a sudden flare-up with
fighters of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. Hamadeh's
bodyguard, Mohammed Meri, also was wounded in the shootout, police
reported.
   They said Hamadeh's death caused intensified clashes with
machine guns and hand grenades inside the camp. The Rashidiyeh
camp, 50 miles south of Beirut, is home to 18,500 Palestinian
refugees registered with the United Nations and an unknown number
of unregistered refugees and other occupants.
   The fighting followed the assassination of a PLO official at his
home in Rashidiyeh on Friday. No group has claimed responsibility
for the killing. But a PLO statement blamed it on ``Israeli
collaborators seeking to trigger a war'' between Arafat loyalists
and opponents in the camps.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council and Fatah are at odds because of a
bitter feud over policy between Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri
al-Banna, and Arafat.
   Abu Nidal's group is outside the PLO, which brings together a
number of Palestinian guerrilla groups, the largest being Arafat's
Fatah.

<HEAD>Texas Beaches Are Important for Wildlife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day at the beach on South
Padre Island wouldn't be complete without gooey, black tar that
visitors often take home on their car carpeting or beach towels.
   Petroleum gunk and maritime garbage are regulars on a coastline
coming under assault from the leaking supertanker Mega Borg.
   Despite the abuse, though, Texas' 600 miles of Gulf Coast
encompass some vital wildlife areas.
   The state has taken the brunt of some of the worst U.S. oil
spills _ not to mention many smaller, little-noticed discharges
that come with heavy tanker traffic.
   Texas ports handle some 225 million tons of oil products
annually, according to Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
   ``Texas beaches normally aren't what you'd call pure white
sand,'' said David Sager of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department's Resource Protection Division. ``We do seem to have a
problem with oil spills and ocean trash.''
   In fact, it's a challenge to walk along the state's beaches
without stepping in sticky black tar. Many coastal hotels provide
guests with tar remover. Scientists say some of the tar comes from
natural ocean-floor seepage, but the tar coating grows considerably
after major oil spills.
   ``Unfortunately, there are those who don't want the oil industry
to be held responsible for any of the tar and want to say it's all
natural,'' said Tony Amos, a senior researcher with the University
of Texas Marine Science Institute at Port Aransas.
   Amos has surveyed the beach at Mustang Island in south Texas
every other day since 1978.
   He found 1979 was a particularly bad year, after the huge Ixtoc
I well blowout off Mexico's Bay of Campeche and the Burmah Agate
tanker spill of up to 10.7 million gallons of oil in Galveston Bay.
The Burmah Agate was the second worst U.S. spill, topped only by
last year's Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska.
   Amos in 1979 found huge accumulations of beach tar and at one
point encountered 90 percent of shore birds with at least some oil
on them.
   In the latest spill, more than 4 million gallons of oil escaped
from the Mega Borg after it exploded June 8 and caught fire 57
miles off the Galveston coast.
   Coast Guard officials said Saturday that most of the spill
either burned or evaporated, and that an estimated 12,000 to 40,000
gallons remained in the water in a slick stretching for miles and
heading toward the Galveston area.
   ``The leading edge is still 25 miles away. It's only moving two
miles a day,'' said Chief Petty Officer Gene Maestas in Galveston.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it was
possible, however, that some oil could come ashore as early as
Sunday.
   Scientists originally feared the oil might come ashore south of
Galveston, between Freeport and Corpus Christi because endangered
brown pelicans breed there at this time of year and could have
suffer a devastating blow, said Kenneth Schwindt, assistant manager
of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.
   It also could have hurt the area's struggling endangered
southern bald eagles, peregrine falcons and sea turtles.
   The world's only breeding flock of whooping cranes winters at
the Aransas Refuge, but the spill probably would not have hurt the
more than 150 whoopers expected to return this year, Schwindt said.
The barrier islands running parallel to the coast protect their
marsh habitat, he said.
   Those barrier islands also catch tons of plastic and other trash
dumped from ships and drilling rigs in the Gulf.
   Volunteers have picked up some 1,250 tons of international
garbage from Texas beaches since the state's General Land Office
began semiannual beach cleanups in 1987. Up to 70 percent of the
garbage was made of plastic, according to the Land Office.
   Currents in the Gulf tend to send the trash ashore in Texas,
rather than other states, said Ron Calhoun, a Land Office spokesman
in Austin.
   ``They (ships) have been doing it for thousands of years, but
now that they've got plastic, it washes up on Texas beaches,''
Calhoun said.

   National Guardsmen and police dogs combed
riverbanks and roamed wrecked homes and businesses today in search
of more than 50 people missing after a killer flash flood.
   At least 12 people died late Thursday when a wall of water
enveloped the fringes of this eastern Ohio village. A thunderstorm
dumped 5{ inches of rain in 3{ hours, overflowing two creeks and
swelling the Ohio River.
   ``The damage ... was extraordinary. It was something that was
beyond what I've seen from tornadoes and floods previously. One can
only imagine what it was like,'' Gov. Richard Celeste said this
morning after making his second flight over the area. ``The shock
of the wall of water as it roared through a very confined area
literally flattened everything.''
   Flood-ravaged areas were sealed off today so police dog teams
from as far away as Maryland and Kentucky and members of the Ohio
National Guard could search for the missing.
   The body of a 5-year-old girl was pulled late this morning from
from McMahon Creek, northwest of the primary search area, said
Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   ``They have sealed off the area around Wegee and Pipe creeks to
everybody but emergency personnel until the search is over to help
the dogs pick up the scent,'' said Stacie Gilg, a spokeswoman for
the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
   Adjutant Gen. Richard Alexander, commander of the Ohio National
Guard, said 341 Guard personnel, including 130 engineers, were
assisting in search and rescue and rebuilding efforts. Officials
from West Virginia and the U.S. Coast Guard were also taking part.
   The Highway Patrol reported at least 60 people unaccounted-for,
Ms. Gilg said. The Belmont County Sheriff's Department reported 51
people missing.
   Houses and businesses were washed away, roads were damaged and
families were scattered in the flash flood, which caught the
National Weather Service off guard. Alexander said at least 60
homes were destroyed and at least 50 others were damaged.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' Gregg Warren, trustee in nearby Mead
Township, said Friday. ``It's unbelievable. A creek you could walk
across with water up to your ankles in some places rose 15 to 25
feet.''
   A 9-year-old girl, Amber Colvin, survived for seven hours on the
Ohio River by clinging to logs and doing the dog paddle _ the only
swimming stroke she knows _ after she was washed out of her home by
floodwater.
   The girl, found seven miles from home, was hospitalized in fair
condition with minor scrapes and bruises. She said she was swept
from a bathtub when the house began to fill with water. A
12-year-old friend of Amber's remained missing.
   ``We got in the bathtub, and the water was over our heads and
then the house collapsed,'' Amber said Friday.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday declared as
disaster areas Belmont County, where Shadyside is located, and
nearby Jefferson County. Franklin County in central Ohio also was
included in the disaster declaration because of flooding there.
   The declaration makes residents eligible for federal aid.
   Celeste, who flew over the area Friday and again this morning,
said he had not seen so much damage since a tornado ripped through
Xenia in western Ohio in 1974, killing 37 people.
   ``A wall of water wiped a path through the area,'' Celeste said.
   Ohio's two U.S. senators, John Glenn and Howard Metzenbaum, also
toured the area Friday.
   ``When children and adults perish in such a disaster as this,
it's very hard to know how to react,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Glenn called the flood-damaged portions of the city of 4,300
people a ``war zone.''
   Chuck Vogt, an investigator for the Belmont County coroner's
office, said all of the dead were from either Shadyside or Mead
Township, where the two creeks run south of Shadyside.
   Shadyside is about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va.
   At least five houses along the Wegee Creek were washed away and
two cars floated Friday in water in one of the basements.
   Jim Leonard of the American Red Cross said relief teams set up a
shelter at an elementary school. About 200 people came and went
during the day Friday. Most sought news of friends or relatives.
   Doctors and ministers at the school counseled people who lost
relatives and friends.
   The National Weather Service did not warn residents because a
thunderstorm in the area appeared on radar to be less severe than
it was, said Al Wheeler, deputy meteorologist in Cleveland.
   The weather service issued a flood watch, indicating that floods
along small streams and low-lying areas was possible, but it did
not issue a flood warning, which alerts residents to take shelter.

   Colorado Springs Mayor Robert Isaac was in the
middle of a long list of complaints about the federal government
when he paused with a reminder.
   ``Just because you're a Republican doesn't mean you have to
agree with everything that a Republican administration does,''
Isaac said.
   Such an attitude should prove handy to Isaac in his new position
as president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, an organization
dominated by big-city Democratic mayors who blame many festering
urban problems on sharp cuts in federal aid to cities.
   Isaac, whose city has a population of 280,000, leads the mayors'
group at a time when many of its Democratic members are sharpening
their attacks on President Bush.
   They accuse him of ignoring the needs of cities in housing,
education, anti-drug and other programs, and demand a considerable
share of any federal budget savings realized through planned
defense cuts.
   When Isaac takes over Wednesday _ the final day of the mayors'
annual summer meeting _ moving into his current slot as vice
president will be perhaps the organization's most vocal Bush
critic, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Isaac realizes he'll face partisan pressure to tone down the
organization's criticisms of the Bush administration. The White
House and political party officials routinely lobby mayors.
   ``I'm elected to do a job and you can be sure that's what I'm
going to do,'' Isaac said in an interview. ``I may not always agree
with my colleagues but after the votes are taken and the positions
adopted, I'm going to be carrying out those policies as best I
can.''
   Isaac already shares many of the concerns of his big-city
Democratic colleagues.
   He is highly critical of sending federal anti-drug aid to states
and forcing cities to compete for assistance and wait longer for
aid. He supports tough law enforcement in the drug war but says
cities also need much more money to reduce demand through by
treating users.
   And Isaac says the mayors need to put more pressure on the
administration and Congress to spend more of the billions of
dollars piling up in highway and aviation trust funds _ money the
White House and many in Congress are reluctant to spend because the
balances of those accounts help hide the true size of the federal
deficit.
   ``This money ought to be spent as it was designed to be spent,''
he said.
   Isaac's greatest complaint is that mayors _ ``those of us who
make decisions at the lowest level of government and provide the
most services'' _ are not consulted enough when the federal
government placed new demands on governments.
   ``We have considerable mandates and requirements placed on us by
the federal government but less and less money to carry them out,''
Isaac said. ``I have always rejected the approach that funding of
the cities was a handout. There are certain functions of the cities
that certainly the federal government ought to be involved in
paying for.''
   Isaac succeeds Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, a Democrat, as
conference president. Flynn will be in line to succeed Isaac next
year.
   Many Democratic mayors were disappointed that Ms. Whitmire was
not more vocal in her criticism of Bush, who has adopted her city
as his hometown and who had her as a guest at the White House
during a January meeting of the mayors in Washington. Her only
outspoken criticism of the administration has focused on spending
of federal anti-drug money.
   Flynn won the No. 3 conference leadership post last year in an
unusual partisan floor fight in which Ms. Whitmire sided with
Republican mayors. He offered strong praise of Isaac and said
having a Republican leader of the conference could help the mayors
as they lobby for more federal aid.
   ``What we do now can't be interpreted as partisan,'' Flynn said
in an interview. ``Bob is a Republican, somewhat conservative, from
the West, and here I am from the East, a Democrat, moderate to
liberal. It's hard to ignore that unique combination of concern
about what is happening to America's cities.''

   Blacks staged dozens of
peaceful rallies nationwide on Saturday to commemorate the 1976
Soweto student uprisings that shaped an entire generation of
anti-apartheid activists.
   About 20,000 blacks, most of them young, packed a Soweto stadium
to observe June 16, 1976, or Soweto Day, when police opened fire on
black students protesting the education policies of the white-led
government.
   ``The youth of Soweto is now a great symbol of resistance and
defiance throughout the world,'' African National Congress leader
Walter Sisulu told the crowd.
   Soweto, 10 miles outside Johannesburg, is the country's largest
black township with 2.5 million residents.
   The 1976 police shootings in Soweto touched off an unprecedented
wave of unrest that spread throughout the country and lasted
several months. Some 500 to 700 blacks died and thousands fled the
country to join the ANC.
   Many blacks point to the 1976 riots as the time when they became
active opponents of the white-led government and its apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   ``Fourteen years ago we mourned and complained, but today we are
counting our victories,'' ANC spokesman Popo Molefe told tens of
thousands of blacks at a rally outside the southern city of Port
Elizabeth.
   The ANC, the country's largest black opposition group, was
legalized in February after being banned for 30 years. ANC leader
Nelson Mandela, the country's best known anti-apartheid figure, was
released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison and is on a highly
publicized tour of Europe, North America and Africa, urging other
nations to maintain economic sanctions on South Africa.
   Dozens of peaceful Soweto Day events were held Saturday around
South Africa, most of them staged by the ANC or the rival Pan
Africanist Congress.
   Since coming to power last year, President F.W. de Klerk has
allowed peaceful protests that have official permission.
   Saturday marked the first time since the 1976 riots that
widespread demonstrations have taken place on Soweto Day without
major police intervention.
   In one incident in downtown Johannesburg, police fired tear gas
to disperse a few dozen black demonstrators, saying they did not
have permission for the protest. A black journalist was taken into
custody, according to witnesses.
   Police also used tear gas to disperse rallies in Natal Province,
the one region where a 4-year-old state of emergency remains in
effect. De Klerk lifted the emergency in the rest of the country
June 9.
   In the central town of Welkom, about 250 members of the white
supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement marched to protest the
detention without charge of two whites.
   Members dressed in khaki uniforms gave stiff-armed, Nazi-style
salutes and chanted, ``Hang (Nelson) Mandela.'' They then marched
to a nearby police station and handed in a petition protesting the
detentions.
   The two men are being held in connection with separate bomb
attacks in Pretoria and Welkom, but no one has been charged in
either case.
   The 1976 protests were triggered by a government policy to teach
classes in Afrikaans rather than English. Afrikaans is the language
of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate the government and
many blacks consider it the ``language of the oppressor.''
   Every year since 1976 blacks have observed June 16 as an
unofficial holiday. Most blacks stay home from school and work.
   The ANC said that the inferior black education system that
caused the 1976 unrest still exists. Black teachers are holding
strikes and protests throughout the country, and some black schools
in urban areas have been closed for much of the year. Last year,
only 42 percent of black high school seniors passed their final
examinations required to receive a diploma.
   The government's per pupil expenditure on whites is about five
times more than on blacks.

   The bound and decapitated body of an
Illinois man who worked as a travel guide has been found in a
remote area of northern Guatemala, a police officer in the region
said.
   The body of Michael Vernon Devine, 49, of Belleville, Ill., was
discovered June 9, the officer said in a telephone interview. The
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Devine's money
and watch were missing but that he did not know if robbery was the
only motive for the killing.
   The body was found about two miles from the town of Poptun, 240
miles northeast of Guatemala City in the province of Peten, the
officer of the provincial capital of Flores said.
   The tied-up body was found in a clump of bushes, the policeman
said.
   He did not say who found the body.
   The disappearance of Devine, a tourist guide who owned the Xobel
de Poptun inn, was reported by his wife, Carole A. Moore, the
officer said.
   Devine also transported merchandise between ranches in the
Poptun region near the Guatemalan border with Belize, the officer
said.
   The victim was transporting goods when he disappeared, the
officer said. He did not identify the goods or say whether Devine's
vehicle was taken.
   Officials at the U.S. Consulate in Guatemala City said it did
not have any information on the case.

Liberate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLELO, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Army Capt. Robert Hamsley returned
Saturday for a hero's welcome to this Breton village he helped
liberate nearly 46 years ago from Nazi German occupiers.
   Children waving American and French flags greeted Hamsley as he
was paraded through the village in a World War II vintage command
jeep. Nearly all of Plelo's 2,300 residents turned out to applaud.
   A detachment of U.S. Marines and French soldiers stood by as
Hamsley, 71, was given the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, one of
the nation's most distinguished awards. The village sports stadium
was renamed in his honor.
   Hamsley, of Lawrenceburg, Tenn., and Orlando, Fla., appeared a
bit taken aback by the acclaim.
   ``I love you, Plelo,'' he said in a toast.
   At a ceremony at the village's monument to the dead of World War
II, Plelo Mayor Yves Le Coqu hailed Hamsley as the village's
``American savior.''
   In August 1944, Plelo was occupied by the Nazis, who were
preparing to carry out a series of executions when Hamsley entered
the village at the head of a five-tank platoon.
   His men wiped out a contingent of the heavily armed Germans. But
two days later, German anti-tank guns knocked out four of the five
tanks and damaged Hamsley's own M-4.
   However, Hamsley and his crew managed to destroy the guns and
killed or drove off about 100 Gemans.
   Hamsley received a Bronze Star for his action and was promoted
from lieutenant to captain. But his action was not even reported in
the official diaries of the 15th Cavalry Regiment of Gen. George
Patton's Third Army.
   The belated recognition was prompted in part by the efforts of a
history buff who also served in the 15th Cavalry, Robert Dwan, of
Tuscon, Ariz. Dwan, along with amateur French historians,
pinpointed Hamsley as the hero of Plelo.
   Last year, the Plelo village council named Hamsley an honorary
citizen ``in testimony of our gratitude for your courageous action
of Aug. 6, 1944, which led to (the village's) liberation.''
   The mayor then invited Hamsley to Saturday's ceremony in his
honor.

<HEAD>First College Reopened In West Bank Seen As Test Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAID GHAZALI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli authorities on
Saturday reopened the first of six colleges in the occupied lands
that have been closed for 30 months due to the Palestinian uprising.
   The reopening of Ramallah College of Paramedical Sciences is
seen as a test case. If it goes well, the other Arab universities
in the occupied territories could be allowed to open again, too.
The schools have a total of 18,000 students.
   The Palestinian institutions of higher learning were closed by
the Israeli military shortly after the uprising erupted in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip in December 1987. The military contended
the schools were hotbeds of unrest.
   The shutdown drew sharp criticism from the United States and
Western Europe, which said it amounted to collective punishment.
The European Parliament at one point recommended that scientific
cooperation with Israel be frozen until the universities and
colleges in the occupied lands were reopened.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered the gradual reopening of
the schools on May 14. But the order was suspended for a month
following the May 20 massacre of seven Gaza laborers by an Israeli
gunman near Tel Aviv and the subsequent wave of riots in the
occupied territories.
   There were virtually no classes at the Ramallah school on
Saturday because many students failed to appear. On the nearby
Jerusalem-Ramallah road, long lines of cars were seen at army
roadblocks, and some students said it was hard to pass through.
   The college director, Farsin Arabikian, that while the school
was closed, some students got married, others went abroad and some
were jailed. Only 15 of the former 38 nursing students had
re-registered, she said.
   ``The fate of the college is unpredictable and students are
affected by what is going on outside the college,'' she said.
   Arabikian expected about 150 students to pursue studies this
year in the college's three departments _ nursing, X-ray and
medical technology.
   On Saturday, about a dozen students standing outside the
college, a branch of Jerusalem University, said they hoped their
studies could continue.
   ``There is a decision by the uprising leadership not to use the
academic institutions as centers for demonstrations and other
activities,'' said Halil Mustafa Sarahne, 23, from Hebron in the
West Bank.
   While the school was closed, Sarahne spent 10 months in
detention at the Ketziot prison camp in the southern Negev desert
for uprising-related activities he declined to specify.
   Now this medical technology student carries a special identity
card that prohibits him from passing through Jerusalem on his way
to the college.
   ``If police stop me in Jerusalem I will automatically be served
with six months in administrative detention'' without trial,
Sarahne said.
   Underground leaders of the rebellion have said in recent
leaflets that resumption of studies was a top priority, and that
students must not give the army an excuse to close schools.
   Yasser Obeid, head of the Ramallah college's Board of Trustees,
said Israel's coordinator of activities in the occupied
territories, Shmuel Goren, warned him the school would be closed
again if students start rioting.
   Goren told The Associated Press in May that schools would be
closed immediately if violence recurred.
   ``I'm not sure they can control their students. But at least
they promised that they can do it,'' he said then.
   Obeid said he believed the college's 233 students just want to
study.
   ``They are very eager to continue their education,'' he said.
   The other Palestinian universities that remain closed are
Bethlehem University, Islamic University, Hebron University,
An-Najah University and Bir Zeit University.
   During the shutdown, instruction has continued in the makeshift
``underground classes'' but attendance was sporadic and the
education far below the normal standards.

   The government and Tamil rebels
declared a cease-fire Saturday in another attempt to end a
7-year-old separatist campaign that has claimed more than 11,000
lives.
   Last year, the government gambled it could achieve peace by
appeasing the rebel Tamil Tigers. That gamble failed last week when
government and military officials said more than 130 unarmed
policemen were massacred by the rebels and hundreds more were
missing.
   After the Tigers broke an earlier truce on Monday, at least 376
people were killed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, according to
reports compiled by witnesses, military sources and rebel
officials. The government has not given a comprehensive death toll.
   Saturday's cease-fire came after two days of negotiations.
Military officials in Colombo and a Tiger spokesman in the northern
rebel stronghold of Jaffna said it took effect throughout the north
and east as scheduled at 6 p.m. Residents in the eastern town of
Batticaloa, where the trouble started when the Tigers captured the
police station Monday, confirmed the shooting had stopped.
   The Tigers were patrolling Batticaloa, according to the
residents who were contacted by telephone from Colombo, 135 miles
to the southwest. They declined to give further details and spoke
on condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety.
   For the past 13 months, President Ranasinghe Premadasa's
government and Tiger leaders had been negotiating on a
power-sharing arrangment designed to draw the guerrillas away from
the separatist campaign they launched in 1983 and into politics.
   The government let the rebels assume many military and civil
powers. But its trust was shattered by the Tigers' methodical
attacks in the past week in the north and east. The Tigers overran
at least 20 police stations staffed by officers whose orders were
to surrender, not shoot, and shot and killed some of their captives.
   A few hours before the cease-fire was announced, Premadasa
referred to the Tigers as ``terrorists'' _ a sharp departure from
his previous conciliatory efforts.
   He warned that unless the attacks stopped ``they will have to
face the consequences and face the same fate'' as Sinhalese
extremists whose leaders were decimated by the government last
winter.
   Even before the attacks, there had been signs of trouble. The
Tigers, consisting largely of teen-age guerrillas, had grown
increasingly bold in the last few months, extracting ``taxes'' from
local businesses and telling the army and police where they could
and could not go.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim the Sinhalese majority discriminate against them in jobs and
education.
   After the massacres of the policemen, the army and the Tigers
battled for five days for control of key towns in the north and
along the eastern sea coast.
   When the Tigers captured the police station in Batticaloa, they
allowed its 300 men to take refuge at an air force base or with
Roman Catholic priests.
   The government, perhaps reassured by that, told police to
surrender rather than fight if their stations were attacked.
   That was what police did at Kalmunai, 22 miles south of
Batticaloa. Of the 115 policeman on duty Monday night, only one
lived to tell what had happened.
   The sole known survivor, a 23-year-old officer named Piyeratna
Ranaweera, said all 115 were blindfolded, loaded into three buses,
taken into the jungle, forced to lie face-down on the ground and
sprayed with bullets from T-56 assault rifles.
   Then shots were fired at close range into their heads, Ranaweera
said in an interview at Kandy General Hospital.
   His left arm broken by rifle fire and his left ear grazed by a
bullet, he said he crawled out of the heap of bodies after the
Tigers left.
   After a 12-hour, 14-mile walk during which he fainted at least
twice, he reached government lines and was flown to Kandy, in the
center of the island.
   Altogether, about 800 policemen surrendered to the Tigers,
according to the Defense Ministry. The government says it has no
firm information on their fates.
   ``We still do not have orders to shoot,'' said an officer at
Ampara, 13 miles southwest of Kalmunai. ``We don't care about
orders. If we come under fire, we'll shoot.''

   The South Carolina judge overseeing singer James
Brown's work-release program was asked to please, please, please
let the Godfather of Soul testify at the Rev. Al Sharpton's fraud
trial.
   ``Mr. Brown's testimony ... is relevant, material and necessary
to the case,'' attorney C. Vernon Mason wrote last week to Circuit
Court Judge Rodney A. Peeples. The judge would have to approve
Brown's trip to New York.
   Sharpton, a flamboyant civil-rights activist who recently lead
protests in the racially torn Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, is
on trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan on charges he stole
$250,000 from the non-profit National Youth Movement. He once
worked as Brown's hairdresser.
   Brown was released to a halfway house for the work program
earlier this year after serving 15 months of a six-year sentence
for aggravated assault. The defense in Sharpton's case begins on
Tuesday, but there was no word on whether Peeples would allow Brown
to take the stand.

   Jimmy Vaughan is leaving the Fabulous Thunderbirds
after 15 years, but he's not going away mad, the rock band's
manager says.
   ``Jimmie's not leaving the band on a bad note,'' said manager
Mark Proct. ``He's real happy. Obviously no one in the band wanted
to see him leave. But it's a decision Jimmie made on the basis of
his personal life and his family.''
   Vaughan, who helped found the group and shaped its sound with
his bluesy guitar licks, will be replaced by two guitarists _ Duke
Robillard, founder of Roomful of Blues, and Doug ``Kid'' Bangham,
formerly of the East Coast band Sugar Ray and the Blue Tones.
   Vaughan is working with brother Stevie Ray Vaughan on a project
scheduled for release in September. The two brothers are considered
to be among rock music's leading guitarists.

   On Music Row, he is known as a ladies'
man, but country music star Lee Greenwood says he's also quite a
family man.
   In fact, the 47-year-old Greenwood is a proud grandfather _
three times over. But he wasn't always thrilled with his
``grandpa'' status.
   ``It was a negative to me until I saw an ad some years ago with
Tom Jones carrying his grandchild. I said, `Man, he looks cool with
that little baby.'''
   Greenwood, who has been married four times and is considering
marrying Miss Tennessee Kim Payne, says he does try to stay out of
his offsprings' lives.
   ``My mother and father were divorced when I was quite young and
there was a big battle between my mother and grandmother to raise
me.
   ``Too much input from grandparents, I think, is not good. I
don't want to overshadow my children's lives.''
   Greenwood is known for his Grammy-award winning 1983 hit
``I.O.U'' and his chest-pounding 1984 anthem ``God Bless the
U.S.A.''

<HEAD>Fort Worth, Texas, Museum Buys 19th Century Masterpiece To Keep It

<TEXT>
   A 19th-century masterpiece was bought
from one museum by another for $10 million to keep ``The Swimming
Hole'' in the city.
   After a two-month debate over the possibility of a New York
auction for the painting by Thomas Eakins, it was purchased by the
Amon Carter Museum.
   The sale will be concluded this week, Jan Keene Muhlert,
director of the Carter museum, said Friday.
   The Fort Worth Art Association, governing body of the Modern Art
Museum of Fort Worth, purchased ``The Swimming Hole'' in 1925 for
$700. But officials recently decided to sell the painting because
it was unsuited to the Modern's collection of post-1920 European
art and post-1940 American art.
   The painting, which had been on loan to the Carter museum for
more than two years, was shipped to New York, then back to the
Modern, while the debate raged about keeping it in the city.
   It will be moved back to the Carter on Tuesday, Muhlert said.
   Eakins, who lived from 1844 to 1916, was known for his portraits
and for such works as ``The Clinic of Professor Agnew.''

   Is Fido feeling feeble? Morris miserable?
Conventional cures can't correct it?
   Take your suffering pet to the acupuncture vet.
   After spending 120 hours in Florida learning the ancient Chinese
art of acupuncture, Ellen Paul has brought her skills back to
Urbana to improve the health of ailing dogs and cats.
   Take Divot, for example _ a dog with more than the usual canine
aversion to cats. She's allergic to them, and when her skin itches,
she tugs at it with her teeth, leaving scabs behind.
   For the cure, Divot stood atop a table, her paws sliding on
stainless steel while Paul stucke needles in the dog's coat and
spinned them.
   ``This is the worst part,'' said Paul. ``Once the needles are
in, they get bored and want to leave.''
   Divot, who started treatments early this month, was calmer when
she returned for her second round of treatments last week, said her
owner, Bob Heister.
   ``She doesn't seem to be biting herself as much,'' Heister said.
``It seems to work.''
   Acupuncture is not a cure-all, Paul said. ``But it does a good
job for the things it is indicated for and is better than some
medication,'' she said.
   The aim is to treat specified pressure points. These known nerve
pathways in humans have analogs in other animals, Paul said, which
share many health problems with humans.
   The 3,000-year-old art seems to boost the immune system and ease
tension, said Paul, who is doing the work without charge while she
perfects her techniques.

   Ballet dancers from 23 countries begin
battling toe-to-toe Sunday, testing their grace, power and
precision at the International Ballet Competition.
   ``It is the Olympics of the dance world,'' said event spokesman
Tracy Harbour.
   ``Some of the greatest dancers in the world are here. It's a way
for many of them to get money, to get credentials, to get
recognition, to gain status in the industry,'' he said.
``Historically, this competition is known for launching the careers
of many dance greats.''
   Big-name former medalists include Soviet-born dancers Mikhail
Baryshnikov and Alexander Godunov.
   It is the fourth time the competition has been held in the
Mississippi capital and the debut of entrants have come from Cuba,
Spain and Guatemala. About 100 men and women dancers, most members
of recognized ballet companies recommended by their directors, were
scheduled to compete.
   The competition is held in Jackson every four years. In other
years, it's held in Varna, Bulgaria; Helsinki, Finland; and Moscow.
   The event came to Mississippi mainly because of efforts by
Thalia Mara, former artistic director of the Jackson Ballet. In
1982, Congress passed a resolution making Jackson the permanent
U.S. home of the IBC.
   After state support ended in 1985, the non-profit Mississippi
Ballet International Inc. was forced to raise all needed funds.
This year, the event was paid for mostly with $1 million donated by
corporate and private sponsors, including a local rugby club.
   The Jackson area is likely to get more than that back. The state
Department of Tourism estimated visitors would pump about $2.5
million back into the area's economy, said Mimi Dinsmore, a
spokeswoman for the competition.
   Running through July 1, the competition involves three rounds.
In the first, entrants will perform a choice from the classical
ballet repertoire. In the second, competitors must perform a
comtemporary work, something choreographed no earlier than 1950.
   In the finals, dancers must perform in both categories.
   Winners in the Olympics-style event will receive gold, silver
and bronze medals and cash awards from $500 to $10,000.
   But the limelight carries more weight than the medals and cash.
   ``It's a springboard. It's a rare opportunity for the audience
to see, you know, the future Baryshnikov,'' Ms. Dinsmore said.
``And it's a rare opportunity for the dancers to get exposure to
their international peers.''

<HEAD>Mayors Split Over Whether to Seek Constitutional Amendment on
Federal Aid</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mayors-Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors took time out Saturday from
bashing Washington to fight among themselves over whether the
Constitution should be amended to guarantee cities a set percentage
of federal revenues.
   The debate came as more than 200 mayors got down to business at
their annual summer conference, taking committee action on dozens
of proposed policy statements on issues ranging from taxes and
transportation to housing and AIDS research.
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors human development committee
endorsed a resoltion calling on Congress to pass legislation
mandating that a ``fair'' percentage of federal revenues be
channeled directly to cities. If Congress refused to pass such a
law, the resolution would put the mayors on record in favor of a
constitutional amendment requiring the revenue sharing.
   Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode led the support of the
measure, saying the mayors needed to make a forceful statement to
win attention for their concerns in Washington.
   But a separate committee, the mayors' panel on urban economic
policy, voted unanimously to oppose the provision calling for a
constitutional amendment. The proposals endorsed Saturday need to
clear another committee Sunday in order to be presented to the full
gathering next week.
   ``The Constitution should not be part of the budget process,''
Fort Wayne, Ind., Mayor Paul Helmke said.
   That dispute was the only diversion from a day spent largely
following up Friday's opening session attack on Congress and the
Bush administration for not sending more aid to cities. The mayors
are virtually unanimous in saying that aid cutbacks in the 1980s
exacerbated urban housing and education problems and left cities
too poor to provide drug treatment and other services to the needy.
   ``Solutions hinge on the federal government making the urban
areas and people a top priority,'' host Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago said at a morning news conference. ``We basically need an
administration willing to have some courage and strong leadership.''
   But many of the proposals popular with the mayors are viewed
with trepidation in Washington _ among them the mayors' position
that the federal government needs to raise taxes and give some of
the money raised to cities.
   Also high on the mayors' agenda but controversial in Washington
are proposals to spend more of the billions in aviation and highway
trust funds for airport and road improvements. The huge balances in
those accounts hide the true size of the federal budget deficit.
   The mayors rarely fight among themselves or criticize each
other, but there were a few objections to the attacks on the Reagan
and Bush adminstrations led by big-city Democratic mayors.
   GOP Mayor Jimmy Kemp of Meridian, Miss., who was first elected
as a Democrat but switched parties, complained that most of the
resolutions being debated blamed urban problems on Republican
presidents.
   ``That's a bunch of bull,'' he said during the meeting of the
urban economic policy committee.
   In an interview afterward, Kemp said such attacks divert the
mayors from more fruitful discussions. ``That's not what we're here
for,'' he said. ``It makes real progress more difficult to
achieve.''
   Before the Saturday meetings, dozens of the mayors joined Daley
in the city's third annual ``Say No to Drugs'' parade.

<HEAD>Cheering Crowds Greet Mandela in Netherlands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crowd of 10,000 people on
Saturday gave a joyous welcome to African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, who thanked them for staunch Dutch support of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   ``You made it possible for me to be released from prison and to
be able to stand before you today,'' Mandela told the crowd that
jammed a square in central Amsterdam.
   The 71-year-old black nationalist leader was freed in February
after spending 27 years in South African jails.
   The crowd waved ANC flags and banners that said ``Welcome
Mandela.'' Some people climbed lampposts to catch a glimpse of him.
   Later Saturday, Mandela flew on to Britain for an overnight
stopover. The ANC's office in London said Mandela would consult
briefly with ANC president Oliver Tambo in Britain, but would not
make any public appearances.
   The British Foreign Office said it could not confirm Mandela's
arrival since it was an unofficial visit, but the British news
agency Press Association quoted government sources as saying he had
arrived safely.
   He was to fly to Canada on Sunday.
   Mandela said it was of ``special significance'' that his Dutch
stop coincided with commemorations of the June 16, 1976, uprising
in the black township of Soweto, which left hundreds dead.
   ``That is the day on which the South African government decided
to shoot down our children,'' Mandela said. ``If you ignore that it
is the masses of the people who put pressure on their governments,
we cannot win liberation for our country.''
   Earlier Saturday, Mandela met with Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers
and Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek. Mandela also was granted
an audience with Queen Beatrix, a rare honor for non-governmental
visitors.
   Mandela's Dutch stop was announced only last week as a
last-minute addition to the six-week tour that is taking him to 14
countries in Africa, Europe and North America.
   The trip is to thank the world for pressuring the South African
government to remove the ban on the ANC and free him and his
colleagues. Mandela is also urging that economic, cultural,
diplomatic and sports sanctions be maintained against South Africa
until apartheid is completely abolished.
   Mandela is to arrive in New York on Wednesday and begin his
10-day U.S. visit with a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan.
   President Bush and Congress will receive Mandela in Washington
during his eight-city visit, which also will include a speech at
the United Nations.
   The other cities on his itinerary are Boston, Atlanta, Miami,
Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.

<HEAD>Farmer Protest Suspended After Walesa Intervenes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with protest suspended. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa persuaded
farmers Saturday to suspend a protest over low milk prices that had
blocked roads and shut down dairies in northern Poland.
   It was the second such success for Walesa in three weeks. On May
28, he got railroad workers to end a strike that was paralyzing
Poland's Baltic ports.
   The announcement that the protest in the Mlawa region, 80 miles
north of Warsaw, was suspended until July 3 came after three hours
of talks between Walesa and disgruntled farmers.
   In both disputes, the protesters demanded government
intervention to protect them from the harsh effects of the
government's shock treatment to transform Poland's socialist
economy into a free-market system. The government, however, has
stuck to its vow not to make special concessions.
   The farmers complained that their local dairy, deeply in debt,
has not yet been paid for milk delivered in May and that the price
it paid for their milk was cut to 2 cents a quart in June, compared
to 5 to 6 cents in April.
   The farmers began blocking the main Warsaw-Gdansk highway on
Tuesday, along with local roads and the Mlawa area dairy plants
themselves.
   Rejecting demands for an immediate rise in milk prices, the
Solidarity-led government Friday night sent out scores of police
equipped with tear gas, truncheons and water cannons to Wisniewo,
outside Mlawa, to open the E-7 highway blocked by tractors and
hundreds of protesters.
   When the more than 50 police vehicles rolled into town under the
government's get-tough policy, the farmers reluctantly lifted the
blockade of the highway. However, local roads and dairy plants
remained blocked until Walesa arrived Saturday.
   Arriving in Warsaw from Switzerland, where he addressed a
meeting of the International Labor Organization on Friday, Walesa
drove straight to Mlawa to try to solve the dispute.
   After the talk, the farmers' protest committee, ``taking into
account the higher good,'' agreed to suspend the strike at least
until July 3, according to a communique given the Polish PAP news
agency.
   Meanwhile, the farmers' union Rural Solidarity was to enter into
negotiations with the government seeking ``profitable conditions
for producing milk in Ciechanow province and in the country.''
   Waldemar Kuczynski, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, defended the decision to threaten the farmers with
force in order to reopen the highway.
   ``A decision to use the forces of order is not an easy decision
and it is not taken with joy,'' he said on the evening TV news show
Saturday. ``The government decided to undertake the decision
because blocking roads violates the law and threatens to paralyze
important fields of the country's life and strikes out at all
people.''

   Two opposition parties on Saturday
pledged to resurrect their pro-democracy movements, which were
targeted in a two-day rampage by coal miners backing
President-elect Ion Iliescu.
   Iliescu said he was contemplating creation of a national guard
to protect the government. He said it would be composed ``of clean,
loyal, honest people who can act resolutely at exceptional times.''
   ``We know that we can rely on you,'' Iliescu told the miners
Friday before sending them home. His comments were carried on
Romanian radio and monitored by the BBC.
   The center of the city was quiet Saturday. Helmeted police with
automatic weapons guarded government buildings and University
Square, the site of a 53-day anti-government rally that riot police
ended Wednesday by firing on demonstrators.
   The state news agency Rompres said six people were killed and
502 injured in violence from Wednesday through Friday, the worst in
Romania since the uprising that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu in December.
   At least 110 people were still hospitalized, seven of them with
very serious injuries, Rompres quoted Health Ministry officials as
saying.
   Security officials detained 1,021 suspects in the
anti-government rioting, the government said Saturday.
   The miners had been asked to restore order on the square.
Protesters gathered there had demanded ex-Communists like Iliescu
be banned from politics.
   The miners, swinging iron bars and clubs, swarmed Bucharest on
Thursday and Friday, attacking anyone they suspected of being
against the government.
   Among their targets was the headquarters of the National
Peasants Party.
   Standing there Saturday among shards of broken glass, smashed
typewriters and furniture, party secretary-general Liviu Petrina
said the struggle for democracy would continue.
   ``Emotionally we are ready to start today,'' he told a reporter.
``Logistically, it could take weeks.''
   The Liberal Party headquarters also were trashed by the miners.
   Calin Tarceanu, a Liberal Party official, said leaders ``are
afraid for our lives, because nobody is protecting us.''
   Dinu Patriciu, another party official, said the Liberals would
``continue to function as a free political party'' despite the
intimidation.
   The miners injured or threatened other government critics and
student leaders who contended Iliescu and other key figures of the
government sought to revive totalitarian rule.
   They also threatened to close down four opposition publications.
One, the Romania Libera daily, said Saturday it had not resumed
printing because its workers feared a threat by the miners to
return and destroy the paper's offices even if the government
allowed it to reappear.
   Iliescu blamed the anti-government riots on right-wing
extremists, whom he charged were aided from abroad.
   ``We are dealing here with a broader scenario of European
proportions,'' Iliescu said. ``There was a joint action of
right-wing forces, which started from the presumption that
right-wing forces in all East European countries could come to
power.''
   Radu Campeanu, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, told
reporters Iliescu's accusations were childish and ``part of an old
Communist pattern.''
   Although Iliescu and his National Salvation Front government
overwhelmingly won free elections last month, his critics demanded
he and other former Communist Party leaders be banned from politics
for 10 years.
   The Front's dominant role since Ceausescu's overthrow has left
other political voices little room to express their views except on
the street.
   There was still no word Saturday on why miners were summoned
instead of relying on police or soldiers to re-establish order.
   Speculation about tensions between the interior and defense
ministries intensified after the state Rompres news agency
published an open letter, apparently from the army, disavowing
responsibility for the clashes with anti-government demonstrators.
   Western governments condemned the violence.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday that
all but humanitarian aid would be withheld, and the European
Community postponed a trade and economic agreement with Romania.
   The miners, among Ceausescu's most outspoken critics, have
strongly backed Iliescu, who gave them pay rises and improved their
working conditions soon after taking power.

   Leaders of Hungary's new democracy on
Saturday paid homage to Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956
anti-Communist uprising, on the 32nd anniversary of his execution.
   The quiet laying of flowers at his graveside contrasted sharply
with the ceremonial reburial of Nagy's remains last year, attended
by hundreds of thousands of Hungarians in a show of support for
democratization.
   This year, government officials joined relatives of Nagy and his
associates who were executed in 1958 but posthumously rehabilitated
last year.
   The officials in attendance included Premier Jozsef Antall and
Interim President Arpad Goencz, who himself was sentenced to life
in prison for his role in the 1956 uprising after it was put down
by Soviet troops.
   Hundreds of Hungarians also laid flowers at the graves.
   The new government was sworn in last month after March elections
that relegated the reformed Communists to a minor role.
   The first law passed by the new parliament, elected in the first
free elections in 43 years, made Oct. 23 _ the day the 1956
uprising began _ a national holiday.
   The new government has also gone on record as saying it wants to
quit the Warsaw Pact. The Nagy government had also said Hungary
would withdraw from the Pact.

<HEAD>Appalachian Tour Part Of Search For Reality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Betty Ellis, a 64-year-old Minneapolis
housewife, says ``intellectual curiosity'' drew her to join nine
others Sunday on a 10-day journey billed as ``Appalachia: Third
World in the United States.''
   Global Exchange, a non-profit research, education and action
center in San Francisco that arranged the ``reality tour,'' hopes
it will lead Mrs. Ellis and her fellow travelers on a path to
political activism.
   Political awareness tours cater to a different breed from the
adventure or educational trips promoted by many travel agencies,
and might be considered the opposite of Club Med's ``antidote to
civilization.''
   Tour members give up luxury hotels, museums, monuments and
romantic dinners to take the opportunity to reshape their views of
the world.
   The $500 per person Appalachian tour, for example, will go to
Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia to visit a child care center,
agricultural, food and housing projects, the Mountain Women's
Exchange and the Highlander Center in New Market, Tenn., which has
fought poverty, racism, sexism and environmental destruction since
the 1930s.
   There won't be any whiskey-sipping with ``toothless old men in
overalls whittling cedar sticks at a country store,'' as a
Tennessee columnist wrote in conjuring up stereotypes the tourists
might be looking for.
   Global Exchange's tours, in fact, are supposed to break down
stereotypes, inspire people to get involved in community
organizations, and build ties between people in developed and
developing areas _ the so-called First and Third Worlds.
   Poverty can be found in every state _ Global Exchange is
planning other U.S. trips that may include the San Francisco Bay
area _ but the group chose Appalachia because of ``its inspiring
example and rich history of organizing.''
   ``We felt it was very important to highlight community
organizing in the United States as well as the Third World,'' said
Laurie Adams, tour coordinator for Global Exchange. ``We don't feel
you have to go all the way to the Third World to see some of the
problems that are facing communities there.''
   Grassroots organizing is a key aspect of the new activism of the
1990s _ an outgrowth of the citizen diplomacy efforts of the past
decade and a step beyond the protest movements of the '60s and
'70s. Participants span a wide range of ages and professions.
   ``We encourage people on the tours to get involved afterward,
but in whatever ways that are comfortable for them,'' said Adams,
24. ``We've had grandmothers come and get articles published in
local papers. It's encouraging to see that. It takes some courage
and wanting to have a challenge to go on these trips. But you can
have a lot of fun, too.''
   Global Exchange claims 5,000 members nationwide but has a staff
of only five working in a modest office in an ethnically diverse
part of San Francisco. Two other staff members run a store in the
city that sells arts and crafts from the Third World, and two
staffers work in Haiti and Honduras.
   The group, founded 1{ years ago, has published books and
promoted speakers on U.S. policy, Third World issues and grassroots
organizing. In the past year it also has run trips to Haiti, India,
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Brazil, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
   Among the people who have gone on the trips are community
workers and those seeking alternatives to typical vacations,
ranging in age from 18 to 75 and including doctors, nurses, city
officials, nuns, business people, lawyers and housewives.
   Rachel Chapman, a health worker in Los Angeles, went to
Mozambique and Zimbabwe and said she met people in high levels in
the government and families in the countryside.
   ``The personal interaction stimulates and helps each of us
become more capable as leaders,'' she said.
   The trip to Appalachia initially set off a storm of adverse
publicity, and in May, West Virgina was dropped from the tour.
   ``Of course, not all of Appalachia resembles the Third World,''
Adams said, ``just as in Brazil there are wealthy parts and poor
parts. But some of the characteristics are the same.
   ``The resources, such as coal, are extracted for the benefit of
rich outsiders while local workers live in poverty and face
dangerous working conditions. A lot of the control is in the hands
of distant politicians and corporate boards, not in the hands of
local people. Environmental destruction is wrought by things such
as the coal mining industry. And health care, education and
transportation systems aren't fairly distributed.''

   A U.S. civilian instructor at a
Venezuelan air base was killed by robbers who broke into his house
and slit his throat when he failed to understand their demands,
officials said Saturday.
   The U.S. Embassy identified the victim as Mark Ward, 42. His
hometown was not available. Authorities earlier identified Ward by
an incorrect last name.
   He died Thursday evening when two armed men broke into his house
in Maracay, 68 miles west of Caracas, police said.
   The police and the U.S. Embassy said Ward was an F-16
maintenance specialist at the Palo Negro air force base, on the
outskirts of Maracay.
   His 28-year-old fiancee, Betzabet Herrera, was beaten up by the
robbers. She told police what had happened and provided a
description of the assailants.
   The police said Ward, whose Spanish was not good, apparently did
not understand the orders the robbers shouted at him. One of them
slashed his throat.
   The robbers got away with about $640 in cash, as well as
jewelry, and television and stereo equipment, according to police.
   Ward was taken to the hospital by neighbors who heard Herrera's
cries for help. The U.S. Embassy said Ward died of a heart attack
caused by shock and loss of blood.
   An embassy spokesman said Ward, who had two children in the
United States, is to be buried in Venezuela.

<HEAD>Hundreds Go On Rampage After Crowded Social Club is Closed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people angered by the closing of
a crowded Hispanic social club pelted police with rocks and bottles
early Saturday during a window-smashing rampage that took three
hours to quell.
   Police asked owners of the members-only Quisquellano Lounge to
clear out an estimated 250 patrons about midnight after an officer
saw a window break, Lt. Joseph Rowe said.
   ``It was unsafe and overcrowded,'' Rowe said, adding there was
no official occupancy limit. ``After several requests were made
both in English and in Spanish directing everyone to leave the
area, people refused to leave ... and a kind of mob psychology took
over.''
   Reinforcements were called in to help control the crowd that
swelled to about 500 and flooded the streets surrounding the Boston
suburb's central square.
   ``They eventually blocked the entire street. When the first
arrest was made, the crowd turned on the officers and pelted them
with bottles and stones,'' he said, adding that fights broke out in
alleys and store windows were smashed.
   Fifteen people were arrested, most for investigation of
disorderly conduct or failure to disperse. All face arraignment
Tuesday.
   Rowe said no injuries were reported and the disturbance stopped
short of becoming a riot because police ``showed restraint ... did
not attack the crowd.''
   Manuel Ortiz, secretary at the club where owners have applied
for a nightclub license, said it has no liquor license and serves
only soft drinks.
   ``We've never had any trouble here in 15 years,'' he said in a
telephone interview from the club.
   Rowe said he did not know whether alcohol was being served at
Quisquellano, but ``certainly people were under the influence.''

<TEXT>
   Israel's new foreign minister, David Levy, has
apparently suffered a slight heart attack, doctors reported
Saturday.
   Levy, a 52-year-old Likud bloc member who is seen as a possible
successor to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, arrived at Haemek
Hospital in the northern Israeli town of Afula from his home in
nearby Beit Shean on Thursday night.
   He was hospitalized in a cardiac intensive care unit for chest
pains, and his condition was described Saturday as good.
   Dr. Udi Cantor said Levy would stay at the hospital for at least
a week for observation.
   Shamir and Levy took their posts last week in the country's new
right-wing government.

   About 50 police officers clashed with union
members trying to organize janitors during a protest march.
   At least 16 people were injured and 42 arrested during the melee
Friday night in an affluent office complex in Century City.
   Alex MacPhail, a representative of the Service Employees
International Union, said police waded into a crowd of 400
demonstrators swinging clubs.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' MacPhail said. ``I saw
superior officers lose control of their own men.''
   Sgt. William de la Torre said police were restrained and
defended officers' use of force.
   Janitors demanding the right to unionize struck May 30 against
International Service Systems, a firm hired to clean about a dozen
buildings in the complex. The cleaning company has said until the
janitors vote the union in, it will not negotiate with the
janitors' union.

   A Washington woman may have helped
establish a national day for dad, but folks in this coal-mining
town claim they laid the groundwork.
   ``I'd like to describe it as a good-natured rivalry,'' said
Harold Goff, historian for the Central United Methodist Church,
which claims to have held the first Father's Day observance on July
5, 1908.
   ``We've established it using several well-documented books and
people who participated,'' Goff said. ``Even the greeting card
companies have been receptive. About the only outfit we've gotten
short shrift from is the national Father's Day Council.''
   Ted Kaufman, executive director of the non-profit council based
in New York, said he doesn't dispute that the town held the church
service honoring fathers.
   ``But as far as we're concerned, the first Father's Day
observance was in Spokane, Wash., by Sonora Smart Dodd in 1910,''
Kaufman said in a telephone interview. ``All we know is the
movement for a national Father's Day started from that event.''
   No matter who gets the credit, Hallmark Cards Inc. spokeswoman
Barbara Miller said sons and daughters nationwide will mail or
hand-deliver about 90 million Father's Day greeting cards this year.
   The holiday is the fifth-largest for greeting card manufacturers
behind Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mother's Day, the
spokeswoman said from company headquarters in Kansas City, Mo.
   Road signs declaring Fairmont the home of Father's Day and a
plaque marking the site of the first observance have been in place
in since 1984, when the town first began publicizing its claim.
   ``We've held Father's Day services continually since 1908, but
any attempt to get wider attention has kind of languished,'' Goff
said. ``We're not saying we're responsible for the national
holiday, just the first observance.''
   Mike Archer, a spokesman for the Spokane Chamber of Commerce,
said Woodrow Wilson first proclaimed Father's Day in 1916, based on
Mrs. Dodd's efforts.
   ``I guess we'll go with that to back up our claim,'' Archer said
in a telephone interview. ``We use it in our brochures about the
city.''
   Fairmont's claim centers on Mrs. Charles Clayton, who lobbied
the congregation of the Williams Memorial combined Methodist and
Episcopal Church to honor fathers after Mother's Day was celebrated
in nearby Grafton two months earlier.
   Now a dying railroad town of about 3,000, Grafton still receives
national publicity once a year as the site of the first Mother's
Day service.
   Mrs. Dodd's father was a Civil War veteran who raised her and
her five brothers alone after the death of his wife. She decided
fathers should be recognized, too, after hearing a sermon about
Mother's Day.
   Spokane celebrated Father's Day on June 19, 1910, Archer said.
   Kaufman said it was through Mrs. Dodd's continuing efforts that
Congress in 1972 _ 57 years after official commemoration of
Mother's Day _ declared the third Sunday in June to be Father's Day.
   There had been six previous one-shot official observances,
including Wilson's first proclamation.

   Two diplomats said Saturday they are seeking
Canadian political asylum after walking out of the Republic of
Djibouti's embassy here in support of dissident movements in their
African homeland.
   ``I believe that this embassy is not the true representative of
the people of my country and I cease to work for and to cooperate
with this embassy as of today,'' said former counsellor Ali Dahan
in a statement.
   He was joined in the protest by Abdulkarim Ali Amarkak, the
former financial attache of the embassy.
   They expressed support for the Union of Democratic Movements,
which they described as a Paris-based organization that unites
dissident groups in opposition to the government of Hassan Gouled
Aptidon, president of Djibouti since it achieved independence from
France in 1977.
   The East African moslem country of fewer than 500,000
inhabitants, formerly French Somaliland, has long been plagued by
friction between minority Afars, most of whom live in Ethiopia, and
the majority Issa people, whose lands spill over into Ethiopia and
Somalia.
   Djbouti maintains a small army but its independence is
guaranteed by the presence of French forces including Foreign
Legion troops.
   The embassy was closed Saturday, but The Washington Post in
Saturday editions quoted acting Ambassador Idriss Ahmed Chirwa as
saying Dahan has been suspended and ordered to return to Djibouti
to face charges that he did not specify.

<HEAD>Iowa Flooded While Nebraska Gets Hail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Raccoon River, swollen with recent rains, rose to record
levels and flooded parts of Iowa and Illinois, while Nebraska was
hit with hail the size of golf balls Saturday.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter in central
Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly higher than
the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest at Des
Moines, Iowa, near its 1947 record.
   Flooding closed a large number of roads and washed out bridges
in northeast and east-central Iowa and northwest Illinois. And
nearly 6 inches of rain left roads and basements flooded in
southwestern Minnesota.
   The Mississippi River was more than four feet over flood stage
at Red River Landing, La., and slightly higher than flood stage at
Donaldsonville, La.
   A tornado touched down during the morning west of Monroe, La.,
and thunderstorm wind gusts caused damage south of Ottumwa, Iowa.
Golf-ball size hail fell south of Chadron, Neb.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon from
upper Michigan across Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, northern
Illinois, much of Iowa, northwest Missouri, northeast Kansas and
southeast Nebraska.
   There were showers and storms from western Oklahoma across
northwest and west-central Texas, and over southern Louisiana,
Mississippi, southwest Georgia and the northern portion of the
Florida peninsula.
   Rainshowers and some thunderstorms extended from west-central
Maine into east-central New York, and over northeast Nebraska,
southern South Dakota and Wyoming into north-central Utah and over
northeast Oregon.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 3 inches at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 2{ inches at Des Moines,
Iowa, an inch at Meridian, Miss., and almost an inch at Eau Claire,
Wis., and Moline, Ill.
   The morning low temperature of 65 degrees at Hollywood, Fla.,
tied its low temperature record for the date set in 1972.
   The nation's low Saturday morning was 29 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 99 at the Air Force Base near San
Antonio, Texas.

   On passage of the congressional pay raise:
   ``It's a zero issue, it's gone. For all of Ralph Nader's
challenges and for all of the radio talk shows, the public is not

   On a proposal by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut payroll
taxes:
   ``I don't think Moynihan proposed (it) with the expectation that
it would actually happen. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think he proposed
it for the shock value.''
   
   On special interest groups paying for travel by members of
Congress:
   ``You're going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing
it on public expense than at the expense of private interests. The
public reaction is `We don't give a damn if it's taken out of
special interests, but don't take it out of our pockets.'''

<HEAD>ACLU Releases Report on AIDS Discrimination</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear of the AIDS virus is so prevalent in the
United States that one-third of the people who reported
AIDS-related discrimination do not even have the disease, an
American Civil Liberties Union report said Saturday.
   ``This study shows how extraordinarily persistent discrimination
remains in this country, even after science has proven there is no
risk of casual transmission,'' said Nan D. Hunter, principal author
of the study.
   The ACLU study, ``Epidemic of Fear,'' will be presented at the
Sixth Annual Conference on AIDS in San Francisco this week. The
study was compiled from information provided to the ACLU by 260
legal and advocacy groups across the country.
   Discrimination hurts the fight to control AIDS because many who
have the disease refuse to be tested out of fear they will become
victims of intolerance, experts say.
   About 13,000 complaints of AIDS or HIV-related discrimination
came into the 260 agencies between 1983 and 1988. HIV is the virus
that causes AIDS.
   Discrimination reports increased by 50 percent during 1988,
following an 88 percent increase in 1987, the report said.
   The study found that AIDS-related discrimination occurs
nationwide, cutting across lines of race, gender, ethnicity and
sexual orientation. Even people who do not have the disease but
associate with people who do are frequent targets of
discrimination, the report said.
   Most discrimination cases were based on fears of catching the
disease, racial prejudice, or anti-homosexual prejudice, according
to the study.
   Thirty percent of the people who reported discrimination were
not HIV positive, the study said. Twenty-one percent of the
discrimination complaints were from victims who thought they were
targeted due to their risk of becoming HIV positive through a job,
lifestyle or other factors.
   Nine percent felt they were the victims of discrimination merely
because of their proximity to someone who was HIV positive. That
closeness might be through a family relationship or by providing
care or some type of services to an infected person, the report
said.
   ``HIV discrimination is the No. 1 obstacle to controlling the
epidemic in this country because people are afraid to come forward
and be tested,'' said Carisa Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in New York. ``We are not able to reach
people'' because discrimination makes them afraid to come forward.
   Recommendations for fighting HIV-related discrimination include
upgrading enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, training lawyers
in HIV-related issues and tightening the regulation of insurance
practices.
   Consistent anti-discrimination laws are needed around the
country because some states have strict laws while others have no
laws, the study said. Enforcement of The Americans with
Disabilities Act, which takes effect in 1992, must become a top
priority in the next decade, Ms. Hunter said.
   The act bans discrimination against people with disabilities,
including people who are HIV positive, and will make it possible to
file discrimination charges in federal court.
   The report was hailed by Dr. Mervyn Silverman, American
Foundation for AIDS Research president, who said it points out how
much still needs to be done in the area of AIDS education.
   ``Polls show that a significant percentage of Americans know
AIDS is spread through sex and drugs,'' Silverman said. ``But at
least 25 percent still believe it could be spread casually and when
asked, they said the best way to avoid getting the disease is to
not be associated with anyone who has the disease.''

   A self-described former KGB intelligence chief
said Saturday that the spy agency _ still feared despite Soviet
reforms _ has too much power and should be closed down.
   Up until now, no former KGB official here has publicly proposed
that the agency be dismantled. As a rule, KGB officials who break
with the agency flee abroad or disappear.
   ``The KGB has too much political power, and this way will remain
a threat to democracy because it may be manipulated,'' said Oleg D.
Kalugin, who identified himself as a onetime major general in
charge of foreign counterintelligence.
   ``I would abolish the KGB as such,'' said Kalugin, 55, who spoke
with reporters after a speech to the Democratic Platform, Communist
Party members who are considering breaking with the party.
   He displayed what he said were his KGB credentials, but no one
could be reached at the agency Saturday to comment on Kalugin's
remarks or verify his former title.
   However, CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield in Washington confirmed a
man named Oleg Danilovich Kalugin was at one time a KGB major
general in charge of foreign counterintelligence.
   ``We find it encouraging that an increasing number of Soviet
officials are speaking so candidly,'' Mansfield said. ``We think
there is some merit in this suggestion'' of disbanding the KGB, he
said.
   The urbane, well-dressed Kalugin, who said he spent 12 years as
an operative in the United States, said the KGB supports Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But the former official _ who said he was drummed out of the KGB
this spring _ warned that criticism of the Soviet president is
increasing and that KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov ``will turn
with the tide.''
   Kryuchkov, appointed by Gorbachev less than two years ago, has
been more open than any of his predecessors. He and his top
deputies have granted interviews to Soviet and foreign media, and a
documentary film about the agency has been released.
   The KGB has long been thought to be one of the organizations
that brought Gorbachev to power five years ago.
   The KGB, or Committee on State Security, once terrorized Soviet
citizens and harassed foreigners. It has said it is re-orienting
itself toward the struggle against organized crime and drug
trafficking in cooperation with other foreign intelligence agencies.
   Foreign residents of Moscow notice much less surveillance than
in the past.
   Kalugin revealed no secrets during his appearance and did not
discuss specific KGB cases. But he said he still feared
repercussions.
   ``For the time being, it is only publicity that can curb the
KGB,'' he told reporters.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature formally oversees the agency but
has done nothing to rein it in, he said.
   Kalugin said KGB agents are still spreading disinformation about
leaders of the political reform movement, still tapping telephones,
still playing dirty tricks.
   Kalugin said legitimate domestic KGB operations should be placed
under the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for uniformed
police. Intelligence services should be placed directly under the
president, and KGB border guards should be transferred to control
of the customs service, he said.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical reformer and new president of the
Russian Federation, has made a similar proposal _ to merge the KGB
into a single investigations agency.
   Kalugin, who speaks English well, said he worked from 1958-1970
as a KGB agent in the United States, first as a Radio Moscow
correspondent and then as a first secretary in the Soviet Embassy
in Washington.
   He said he was certain during his tour in the United States that
the CIA had identified him as a spy, but no action was taken
against him.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was cleared of child-abuse
charges that alleged she drank too much while pregnant has given
birth to an apparently healthy boy, a doctor said.
   Diane Pfannenstiel had her baby Thursday evening, said Dr.
Katherine Kohler, an obstetrician here.
   ``He's a beautiful, healthy 7-pound boy,'' Kohler said. ``As far
as anyone can identify, he seems to have no problems. The mother is
also doing well. We are all very pleased.''
   Pfannenstiel, 29, was about four months pregnant when she was
arrested Jan. 4, two months after another judge ordered her to
remain alcohol-free.
   A test revealed she had a blood alcohol level of just over 0.1
percent, the level at which a person is considered intoxicated
under state law.
   Albany County Attorney Cal Rerucha said he filed the child-abuse
charge to protect Pfannenstiel's unborn children from suffering an
ailment such as fetal alcohol syndrome.
   But Judge Robert Denhardt dismissed the complaint, saying the
state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been
injured.
   The defense never presented witnesses, winning the dismissal
after the state closed its case.
   Pfannenstiel's attorney, Mary Elizabeth Galvan, said the birth
in effect vindicates her client.
   ``If prosecutors had their way, she'd (have) had this baby in
jail,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Loggerhead sea turtles were threatened
by crude oil creeping closer to shore from the crippled supertanker
Mega Borg, which spewed more goo into the Gulf of Mexico on
Saturday.
   Divers were planning a rescue mission to pluck about five
loggerhead turtles from waters near the slick's leading edge, said
Edward Klima of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Loggerhead turtles are a threatened species that can grow up to
4 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, he said.
   He said if the turtles eat floating tar balls, mistaking them
for food, they could die. No other marine life appeared to be
threatened, he said.
   About 4.6 million gallons of oil have spilled from the Norwegian
tanker since it was rocked by an explosion June 8, Coast Guard Lt.
Cmdr. Frank Whipple said Saturday. The figure makes the Mega Borg
spill the fifth-worst in U.S. history.
   Coast Guard officials believe most of that oil _ all but 12,000
to 40,000 gallons _ evaporated or burned in the inferno following
the explosion.
   The remaining slick is ``almost hanging out there,'' Whipple
said. The 45-mile-long slick of Angolan crude oil was about 20
miles from Galveston.
   Coastal authorities braced for an onslaught of oil that could
reach Texas beaches as early as Sunday, but might not reach shore
for several days, said Sharon Christopherson of NOAA.
   Where the oil slick might wash ashore was uncertain, but the
latest estimate identified an area between the west end of
Galveston Island and High Island as the most likely landfall.
   About 1,200 volunteers were being trained on how to clean up any
oil reaching shore.
   Tony Redding, spokesman for Smit America Salvage Inc., said the
fire aboard the 886-foot tanker was declared extinguished Saturday
morning.
   Crews continued to douse the hull of the ship throughout the day
to cool the buckled Mega Borg so workers could begin removing its
cargo.
   A small, undetermined amount of oil leaked from the ship
Saturday, Whipple said.
   Geert Koffeman, project manager for Smit America, said the
possibility of the vessel sinking was ``next to nil.''
   Skimmers and booms were used on concentrated oil spots, but most
of the slick was too thin to skim.
   Texas General Land Office representatives, meanwhile, said they
were pleased with an experiment started Friday when oil-eating
bacteria were dumped on a square acre of the slick.
   ``Visually, the results of the microbes are very promising, but
we have no hard science. I'm very optimistic,'' said Blanton Moore
of the Land Office.
   He said it was difficult to tell from the air if the oil had
been eaten by the bacteria or dissipated some other way, adding
that more microbes will likely be used later.

<HEAD>Cyprus Orders Transfusion for Toddler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old girl suffering from leukemia
was given a blood transfusion Saturday by government order, despite
the religious objections of her parents.
   The girl's parents, Titos and Eleni Charalambous, are Jehovah's
Witnesses, a fundamentalist Christian sect that forbids blood
transfusions.
   They had snatched their daughter from a British hospital, where
she was being treated, to avoid a blood transfusion and later
defied a Cypriot court's order to agree to a transfusion.
   In an unprecedented move, the government Friday declare the
child, Stephanie, a ward of the state, making the transfusion
possible without the family's approval.
   ``We had to rescue the child from death,'' said Helen Soteriou,
a British-born leukemia expert at Nicosia's Evangelistria Clinic.
She conducted the transfusion.
   ``It was obvious we couldn't change their minds. Their
convictions are too strong. But we had a child's life at stake,''
she added.
   George Marcoulis, a cancer specialist at the private clinic,
told reporters ``there is a great improvement in the girl's
condition'' after an initial transfusion of one pint of blood.
   ``Her chances of survival are definitely in the range of 60-80
percent,'' Marcoulis said.
   Leukemia is an often fatal cancer of the blood.
   Health Minister Panikos Papageorgiou, himself a physician, told
Cyprus Television on Saturday, ``The improvement in Stephanie's
condition justifies the action we took yesterday in making her a
ward of the social welfare department.''
   He said the government would bear the costs of all further
treatment for the child.
   But Stephanie's father said: ``I didn't see any improvement. I
still feel very unhappy that someone else's blood is in my
daughter's veins.''
   ``Nobody can love my child as much as I do,'' he had told
reporters Friday. ``We'll do everything possible and sell all our
belongings if necessary, with the full support of the rest of my
family, to save Stephanie's life. But we cannot agree to a blood
transfusion,'' he said.
   Cyprus President George Vassiliou visited Stephanie and said
afterward the government respects religious beliefs, but he said in
this case intervention was necesary ``for the safety of the child.''
   Stephanie's parents snatched her from London's Great Ormond
Street Hospital on Monday to prevent her from being given a
transfusion. They returned to Cyprus, defying a British court order
that the transfusion should go ahead.
   The family went into hiding after a Cypriot court ordered a
transfusion. Police issued arrest warrants for the parents and
launched a search to find them in a bid to save the girl's life.
   The warrants were withdrawn after Stephanie's parents took her
to the Evangelistria Clinic on Thursday.
   But later that day, the couple again took Stephanie into hiding
until police tracked them down Friday and placed Stephanie under
state care.
   Day-long efforts by doctors at the clinic Friday to persuade the
parents to permit a transfusion proved futile.

   Victory tasted sweet Saturday for
Okmulgee Pecan Festival participants fighting for the world record
for the largest pecan cookie.
   ``I think we've got it,'' baker Max Keck said. A crowd gathered
20-deep around the special oven Keck built on Main Street to sample
the cookie that he said was 32 feet in diameter.
   The mayor had the first slice Saturday morning of Okmulgee's
latest entry in a pastry war with rival world pecan capital
Moultrie, Ga.
   The two towns have vied with each other since 1987 to win
biggest-pecan-pie honors in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Okmulgee made it last year, with a 40-foot pie.
   Moultrie declined to up the pie ante last year, choosing instead
to bake a giant pecan cookie in October.
   Keck said Saturday the 7,500-pound Okmulgee cookie won out, by
one foot and at least 4,500 pounds. He said the Moultrie cookie was
3,000 pounds.
   Keck built an oven with a tray mounted on wheels to make the
cookie.
   ``They may try to beat it,'' he said. ``We'll just beat it
again, next year.''

   Lithuania on Saturday proposed that its parliament
compromise with the Kremlin and impose a moratorium on its
declaration of independence, officials said.
   The proposal from the republic's Council of Ministers appeared
to coincide with a compromise offered Tuesday by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the official news agency Tass said it
``could mark the beginning of the solution of all the so-called
`Lithuanian problems.'''
   Also Saturday, Soviet authorities began pumping natural gas to a
fertilizer plant in Lithuania, partly easing the 2-month-old
blockade of fuel they imposed to pressure the Baltic republic into
renouncing its March 11 declaration of independence.
   The Lithuanian government suggested the declaration remain valid
but its implementation be frozen while negotiations were under way
with Moscow, said Algis Cekuolis, a consultant for the Baltic
republic.
   However, Cekuolis said it was unclear whether the compromise
would have enough support to be passed by the republic's
legislature, which will probably consider it Monday.
   ``It will be received in parliament by very strong opposition,''
he predicted.
   The Lithuanian government, under Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene, is considered far more disposed to compromise with the
Kremlin than the parliament, which is led by President Vytautas
Landsbergis and dominated by members of the pro-independence
Sajudis popular front.
   Gorbachev proposed compromises Tuesday in a meeting with the
leaders of the three secessionist Baltic states. He told the
national Supreme Soviet legislature earlier that day that ``if
Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of
independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its
implementation at least for the duration of the talks.''
   Saturday's proposal by the Lithuanian Council of Ministers
suggested exactly that, government spokesmen said.
   ``Our act of independence would remain valid,'' said council
spokesman Gentaras Jatkonis. ``But we are postponing the
realization of it.''
   Similar proposals have gone back and forth between the
Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and Moscow in telegrams and informal
talks ``like a ping-pong game'' for weeks but ``this is the first
time it's on an official level,'' Cekuolis said.
   A spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, Aidas Palubinskas,
said he was told on Saturday by a pipeline dispatcher that natural
gas was again flowing from the Soviet Union to the Azotas
fertilizer plant in the city of Jonova.
   ``The plant will be getting 3.5 million cubic meters daily,''
Palubinskas was told by dispatcher Alexander Mishikov.
   Restoration of the gas supply fulfilled a promise made to Mrs.
Prunskiene on Wednesday by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
that 15 percent of the republic's daily natural gas supply would be
restored.
   Politburo member Yuri D. Maslyukov told a news conference in
Moscow on Friday that the restoration of fuel to the Lithuanian
plant was a goodwill gesture from the Kremlin and a ``reiteration
of the Soviet government's interest in speeding negotiations.''
   More than 26,000 people have lost their jobs because of the
Kremlin's blockade of all oil, most natural gas and some raw
materials.
   Palubinskas said that restoration of gas supplies to the Azotas
plant would mean 1,600 employees could return to work by the end of
this week.
   At the beachfront resort of Jurmala in Latvia, leaders of the
popular fronts of Latvia and Estonia and the Sajudis movement of
Lithuania opened a conference to discuss the future of their
movements under democratically elected governments.
   The delegates, 50 from each of the pro-independence movements,
condemned the economic sanctions against Lithuania and discussed
ways of increasing cooperation among the Baltic states and with
other Soviet republics, Tass reported.
   ``Nobody has a right to demand either abrogation or halting the
acts of independence,'' Tass quoted delegates as saying. ``A
retreat will harm the democratic movement.''

<HEAD>Police Apologize for Drug Raid on Racing Commissioner's House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police looking for a marijuana-growing operation
mistakenly raided the home of the state's Horse Racing Commission
chairman, whose wife says officers threw her to the ground and
frightened her 90-year-old mother.
   An apology was made to Warren Chinn and his family, and an
investigation is under way, said police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons.
   Chinn's wife, Honoria Chinn, 50, said Friday she was at home
with her mother about 12:45 a.m. Tuesday when her front door was
broken open and at least five plainclothes officers rushed inside.
   Mrs. Chinn said one of the men grabbed the telephone she was
holding, handcuffed her, threw her facedown on the floor, put a gun
to her head and demanded, ``Where's the man, where is he?''
   The officers gave no warning before battering down the door and
offered no identification, she said.
   ``I'm still in shock,'' Mrs. Chinn said. ``I can't sleep. I get
nightmares every time I close my eyes.''
   The Chinns said police officers apparently used a chemical spray
to subdue their two dogs, which were outside.
   After emptying drawers in two bedrooms and checking the rest of
the house, the officers left, Mrs. Chinn said.
   ``They didn't say a word,'' said Mrs. Chinn, whose niece, Maxine
Chan, is a Police Department specialist on relations with the
city's Asian community.
   Police were acting on information from a person arrested for
possession of marijuana, said department spokesman Mark Amundson.
   It was ``completely the wrong location,'' said Fitzsimons.
   ``It was a mistake of great magnitude as far as we are
concerned,'' the chief said.
   Chinn, who owns two Seattle-area restaurants and was at one of
the restaurants when the raid occurred, said his wife was in her
nightclothes and talking to a restaurant employee when the officers
broke down the door with a battering ram.
   ``She thought somebody was robbing the house,'' he said. ``She
didn't know they were police because they were all in
plainclothes.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday
denied condemned killer John Edward Swindler's last-ditch bid to
avoid becoming Arkansas' first prisoner executed in 26 years.
   The Supreme Court denied the stay request in a 7-2 ruling issued
shortly before noon, with Justices William Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissenting, said high court spokeswoman Toni House.
   Swindler, 46, is scheduled to be electrocuted at 9 p.m. Monday
for the 1976 murder of a Fort Smith police officer. He would become
the first person put to death in the state since 1964.
   Attorney Gerald Coleman said he told Swindler of the high
court's decision by telephone and that he ``took it like a man.''
   ``He didn't break up, but he was disappointed,'' Coleman said.
``He thanked me for calling him and doing what I could.''
   The lawyer said Swindler had reached the end of the line in his
appeals process. ``There's nothing left to do. I know of no other
options,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Swindler appealed to the Supreme Court on Friday,
after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis turned
down his request for a stay Thursday, the same day Gov. Bill
Clinton rejected an application for executive clemency.
   The lawyer said Swindler's mood Saturday was somber. ``He hopes
that this execution will make the people of Arkansas think about
capital punishment in general, to think twice about executing
anybody else on death row.''
   Clinton was not immediately available for comment Saturday,
spokesman Mike Gauldin said.
   James Lee of the state attorney general's office, said
prosecutors were ready to fight any further attempts to block
Swindler's execution.
   ``There are nearly 72 hours between now and Monday night and
anything can happen,'' Lee said on Saturday.
   Amnesty International, which opposes capital punishment,
scheduled a 25-minute silent protest vigil Sunday night at the
state Capitol.
   Swindler was moved to a death cell adjacent to the death chamber
at the Cummins Maximum Security Unit on Friday. He waived his
option to choose his last meal and told officials they could
destroy his personal belongings. Earlier in the week, Swindler
waived his choice between electrocution or death by lethal
injection.
   Swindler was convicted in 1978 of the Sept. 24, 1976, death of
Fort Smith Patrolman Randy Basnett, who was shot twice in the chest
as he tried to arrest Swindler, who was wanted for murder in South
Carolina.
   Before the Arkansas killing, Swindler killed Gregg Becknell, 19,
and Dorothy Rhodes, 18, after forcing them from their car on a
junior college campus in Columbia, S.C. He told police he sodomized
and beat the man and shot him, then beat and shot the woman.
   After exhausting his state appeals, Swindler filed a petition in
federal court and in 1988 U.S. District Judge Henry Woods ruled
that he had received a fair trial. A year later, the decision was
upheld by the three-judge panel in St. Louis.
   The last Arkansas execution came in 1964, when Charles Franklin
Fields was electrocuted.

<HEAD>University: Lambs Carrying Leukemia Virus Handled By Unwitting
Humans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Pennsylvania veterinary
students and staff handling sheep may have been exposed to a
leukemia virus and 100 pre-schoolers were among visitors allowed to
pet the research animals.
   School officials asked 20 possibly exposed students and staff
members to undergo blood tests and offered to make the tests
available to the children and other visitors in a meeting with the
parents Friday night.
   There is little chance anyone became infected by touching the
lambs inoculated with the virus HTLV-1, known to cause adult T-cell
leukemia, medical experts said.
   ``If I were a parent of one the children, I would not be
worried,'' said William Blattner, chief of the epidemiology section
of the National Cancer Institute. ``You can't spread this virus by
petting a sheep.''
   The inoculated sheep were supposed to have been kept separate
from a flock of about 150 other sheep at the New Bolton Center,
said Aron B. Fisher, a professor of physiology and the school's
oversight committee chairman.
   Researcher Jorge F. Ferrer allegedly violated school regulations
by failing to quarantine the sheep inoculated between April 13 and
April 24, officials said.
   The exposure was discovered in early June. Ferrer was suspended
pending an investigation expected to take about a week. Efforts by
The Associated Press to reach Ferrer for comment by telephone
weren't immediately successful.
   The inoculated lambs are believed to have been among sheep that
were castrated and had their tails bobbed by eight veterinary
students and 12 staff members sometime before May 16, officials
said.
   About 100 students from the private Kennett Square Cooperative
Pre-School were allowed to pet the lambs when they visited the
center on May 16 and May 22, school officials said. Thirty adult
visitors also could have come in contact with the sheep.
   The HTLV-1 virus linked to the sometimes fatal blood cancer is
communicated through blood, mother's milk and sexual intercourse,
Penn scientists said.
   ``It's a very minimal risk,'' said Barry Cooperman, university
vice provost for research.
   Permission for the viral experiment by Ferrer, a physician and
professor of microbiology at Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine,
hinged on the sheep remaining isolated, Fisher said.
   Edwin J. Andrews, dean of the veterinary school, said the
university discovered that the flock included inoculated sheep on
May 24 after another researcher asked if the animals had been used
in other experiments.
   Officials established that humans had come in contact with the
sheep early this month.
   Andrews said the likelihood of true infection was extremely
slim, especially among those who merely petted the lambs.
   ``The virus is very fragile and can only be transmitted in a
human setting when it's in live cells,'' Andrews said.

   A psychologist who treated two
brothers charged with killing their wealthy parents testified in
closed hearings that were held to decide whether recordings of
their therapy sessions should remain confidential.
   Beverly Hills psychologist Jerome Oziel was questioned in
private Thursday and Friday in the hearings in the case against
Lyle and Erik Menendez.
   Testimony from Judalon Rose Smyth, a former patient of Oziel who
contacted police after learning of allegedly incriminating
statements the Menendez brothers made to him, was postponed Friday
until June 27.
   News media including The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times
and ABC-TV earlier this month lost an attempt to be present at the
hearings.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht ordered the courtroom
cleared on grounds the discussions would center on whether the
exchanges were privileged doctor-patient communications and
therefore inadmissible as evidence.
   Lyle, 22, and Erik Menendez, 19, are accused of murdering their
parents. Jose Menendez, 45, and his wife, Kitty, 44, died Aug. 20
in the family's Beverly Hills mansion after being repeatedly shot
with shotgun blasts.
   The brothers claim they found the bodies when they returned home
from a night out. Prosecutors allege the siblings were motivated to
kill their parents to claim the wealth of their father, an
executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a video distribution company.
   The brothers' arrest in March occurred after Oziel turned tape
recordings over to authorities. Law enforcement authorities have
said the tapes contain confessions by both brothers as well as
threats made against Oziel and others.
   Smyth, 37, has sued Oziel, 43, alleging physical and sexual
assault and fraud. Oziel has denied the charges and said he and
Smyth were never intimate. Smyth's attorney, Fred Rucker, said he
also filed a complaint against Oziel with the state Board of
Medical Quality Assurance.

   Environment ministers from across Europe
agreed Saturday to work at cleaning up heavy pollution in East bloc
nations.
   ``The problems that have been described were horrendous and far
beyond our forecasts,'' Environment Commissioner Carlo Ripa di
Meana of the European Community said.
   He spoke after ministers from seven Eastern European nations
reported on pollution in their countries at a one-day meeting in
Dublin with ministers of the European Community.
   The ministers from 19 nations planned an attack on industrial
contamination of the air, water and land that has built up over
decades.
   They signed a communique setting out ideas to tackle nuclear and
toxic waste, acid rain and water pollution in the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe.
   It stressed that protection of the environment was one of the
most urgent political priorities.
   The agreement commits Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary,
Yugoslavia, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and the European
Community members to look at ways of effective pollution monitoring
and curbing harmful practices that poison the environment.
   The nations also called for the establishment of a new European
Environment Agency, open to countries outside the European
Community, to help ease the way for the cleanup.
   The ministers heard a catalogue of pollution misery in Eastern
Europe.
   Environment Minister Josef Vavrousek of Czechoslovakia,
complaining of pollution in his nation, said life expectancy in his
nation was 67 years, five years lower than the average for Western
Europe.
   Vavrousek said that until the late 1950s, his country's life
expectancy rate was increasing to about 70 years.
   Since then, the rate had fallen in some areas of worst
pollution. He said that in some heavily polluted areas like
northern Bohemia, the life expectancy is 10 years below the Western
European average.
   The ministers said one of the leading causes of pollution in
Eastern Europe was the massive emissions of sulphur dioxide from
coal-burning power stations.
   East Germany has announced plans to reduce its acid rain levels
by switching from lignite to hard coal at power stations, and to
use more oil and gas.
   That country's environment minister, Karl Steinberg, said the
oldest and dirtiest power stations would be closed and clean coal
technology would be introduced.
   His country is aiming to cut its energy consumption by up to 2.5
percent over the next decade and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
at least 20 percent.

   The government of Liberia and
rebel forces on Saturday called for a cease-fire in their
5{-month-old civil war that has left more than 1,000 people dead.
   Government forces and rebels from the National Patriotic Front
had not clashed for the last 10 days, but Saturday's agreement was
the first time the two sides agreed to a cease-fire.
   The truce came Saturday after five days of peace talks in the
U.S. Embassy in Freetown in this neighboring country. In a
statement issued after the meeting, the two sides agreed to resume
talks Monday.
   ``Meanwhile, it is the expectation of both parties that each
side will exercise self-restraint in the use of military force,''
the two sides said in a statement.
   The sides also agreed to permit international relief aid to
civilians in areas under their control. Their statement also said
government soldiers and rebel fighters would be permitted to
inspect shipments to the opposing side.
   Earlier Saturday, the Liberian government had proposed a 30-day
cease-fire.
   The rebels have repeatedly demanded that President Samuel K. Doe
resign and leave Liberia before a formal truce can be signed. They
accuse him of corruption and human rights abuses.
   Doe has steadfastly refused to resign.
   The Liberian Council of Churches, which is mediating the peace
talks, had been pushing for a cease-fire. The victims have been
mostly civilians.
   The government regained control of the American-managed
Bridgestone-Firestone rubber plantation outside the Liberian
capital, Monrovia, and the nearby Robertsfield international
airport before fighting died down.
   Though the airport remains closed, its recapture by government
troops was the first major setback for the rebels since they
invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
   Four U.S. Navy ships carrying 2,100 Marines are anchored off
Liberia's Atlantic coast in case an emergency evacuation of U.S.
citizens is needed.
   Nearly 150,000 refugees have fled Liberia, and thousands of
foreign nationals have been evacuated. The U.S. Embassy said a
chartered air flight would evacuate more citizens Sunday.
   The war, which began as a rebel insurgency, has escalated into
tribal warfare. Human rights organizations accuse soldiers of
killing people from the Gio and Mano ethnic groups, who have backed
the rebels.
   Rebels have retaliated by killing Krahns and Mandingos, accused
of supporting Doe, who is a Krahn.
   About 5 percent of Liberia's 2 million people are the
descendants of freed American slaves who founded this West African
nation in 1847. They oppose Doe, who seized power in a 1980 coup
that ousted Americo-Liberians from power.

Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arrests totaled 174 by Saturday in a
nationwide dragnet for members of violent, drug-dealing street
gangs, authorities said.
   Federal agents and local police in 11 states began executing
warrants Thursday in a crackdown aimed at the Crips and Bloods,
which have grown from Los Angeles street gangs into multistate
drug-dealing operations.
   Despite the scope of the roundup and volume of arrests,
Operation Streetsweep was going safely, according to Jack
Killorian, spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms in Washington, D.C.
   ``We've had no injuries, no shooting incidents,'' he said.
   Arrests and seizures of drugs and weapons were expected to
continue through the weekend. More than 200 arrests were
anticipated.
   Arrests were made in California, Louisiana, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington and two other states
that weren't identified because warrants were still being served.
   Air Force C-5A transport planes were used in the operation to
shuttle ATF agents and vehicles from Dover Air Force Base, Del.,
across the country.
   Andrew Vita, the ATF chief in Los Angeles, said Friday that the
gangs have ``staked out a large portion of the cocaine trafficking
in this country'' and have been identified in 32 states and 69
cities outside California.
   The operation against them had been planned for months, and
Killorian said Saturday that it was so successful that authorities
will do it again.
   ``We'll be back,'' he said, declining to name a specific date.
``The element of surprise is an important part of achieving safety
to everyone, as was shown.''

   Greece protested to Yugoslavia and the
European Community on Saturday after Yugoslav shopkeepers blocked
the border between the two countries for the second time in a month.
   ``Not only is the border blocked illegally, but Greek-Yugoslav
relations worsen dangerously,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
   Several hundred shopkeepers and craftsmen from the southern
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia blocked the border with cars and
trucks early Friday.
   Thousands of vehicles were backed up at the three border posts
by early afternoon when a local radio station called for an end to
the blockade, said Prokopios Mantzouranis, Greece's consul in the
Macedonian capital of Skopje.
   Macedonia is one of the six republics that comprise Yugoslavia.
   Demonstrators were demanding the abolition of Greek visas for
Yugoslavs and recognition for ethnic Macedonians in Greece. The
demonstration was similar to a one-day border traffic blockade on
May 19.
   Greece does not recognize Macedonians as an ethnic minority.
   The Foreign Ministry said Saturday the Yugoslav ambassador in
Athens was summoned ``and the necessary representations were made.''
   The Greek ambassador in Belgrade conveyed a similar protest to
the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry on Friday. Greece also protested to
the European Commission that Yugoslavia was isolating Greece from
the rest of the community.
   Yugoslavia forms the principal land link between Greece and
other European Community members.

   Three paintings at the Nelson-Atkins
Museum of Art were found with deep scratches blamed on a
disgruntled employee.
   Scratches were found in the paint of two 16th-century German
works and in an 1880 painting by French Impressionist Edouard
Manet, said museum spokeswoman Lisa Austin.
   The scratches were about as deep as a pen point, she said.
   Three other paintings were found with faint pencil marks on
them, but that marring was not thought to have been deliberate, or
even recently done.
   The German works damaged Friday were ``Portrait of a Bearded
Man'' painted by Lucas Cranach the Younger in 1538, and ``Betrothal
Portrait of a Lady'' a 1558 work by Barthel Bruyn the Younger. Both
are part of the museum's permanent collection.
   A scratch was found shortly after the gallery closed Thursday in
Manet's ``Still Life with Brioche,'' on loan from the Carnegie
Museum of Art in Pittsburgh.
   Museum conservator Forrest Bailey said he believed a disgruntled
employee was responsible. ``There were no patrons in the museum and
no visitors,'' he said. ``Only staff were present.''
   ``These things take but a few seconds to do,'' Bailey said.
``It's a sick, unhappy, disturbed person.''
   The three scratched works were removed from display. The German
works, on exhibit in rooms separate from the Manet, suffered the
worst damage.
   ``We believe it was the same person who attacked the Manet,''
Bailey said. ``At least I believe it was. It was a quick, sudden
movement, like done in anger.''
   No arrests were made in the case and no damage estimate was
available. The value of the paintings would not be released for
security reasons, Ms. Austin said.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate For Evicted Families Camping in Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of protesters rallied Saturday in support
of dozens of families living in outdoor camps since being evicted
from their apartments.
   The demonstration was the latest in a growing uproar over a
housing shortage in Paris and a war on squatters declared by the
city in March.
   The 78-year-old Abbe Pierre, France's premier champion of the
needy, led the march from the Place de la Republique to Chatelet in
the heart of Paris.
   Since May 2, 48 families have been living in tents at the Place
de la Reunion in eastern Paris after being evicted from the
apartments where they had been squatters.
   Nine other families evicted from buildings that are to be
renovated were camping at the foot of the famous Montmartre
basilica, Sacre Coeur, and at least six families were camping in
front of a local administrative building in eastern Paris.
   They all said they will remain in their tent camps until the
city provides them with alternative housing.
   ``Paris and all large cities will likely be very beautiful
tomorrow, housing only people with means,'' Abbe Pierre told the
crowd at the rally. ``But they will be cursed by hundreds of
ghettos surrounding them, nests of despair, hate, crime, broken
families.''
   Police estimated the protesters at about 3,000. Organizers said
there were tens of thousands present.
   The city declared its offensive on squatters on March 15, when
the traditional winter moratorium on evictions ended.
   City officials said squatting had reached unacceptable
proportions and sent riot police in to start clearing buildings.
Evictions have temporarily stopped with the growing protest
movement.
   Critics say the city is trying to drive the poor out of town, as
property values steadily rise amid a wave of real estate
speculation recently condemned by President Francois Mitterrand, a
Socialist.
   Premier Michel Rocard last week appointed a mediator between the
protesters and the city to try to resolve the dispute.

<HEAD>Gay Rights Demonstrators Protest Outside Ordination Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 gay rights demonstrators staged a
noisy but generally peaceful protest outside Holy Cross Cathedral
Saturday as 11 priests were ordained inside.
   Church spokesman John Walsh said the ceremonies, conducted by
Cardinal Bernard Law, proceeded without interruption.
   Boston police Detective George Noonan said one person was
arrested, a lone counterdemonstrator. The charges against him were
not immediately available.
   A coalition of gay-rights groups organized the demonstration to
oppose ``Cardinal Law's interference in public policy as well as
his opposition to AIDS education,'' a statement said.
   James M. Claiborne, a deputy police superintendent on the scene,
said the crowd peaked at 1,000 people during the three-hour protest.
   Chanting slogans and carrying signs _ including some reading
``Outlaw Cardinal Law'' and ``Curb Your Dogma'' _ the demonstrators
marched in a circle outside the cathedral behind police barriers.
Protesters blew horns every 10 minutes to mark the rate at which
AIDS patients die.
   Several demonstrators crossed the barriers to approach the
church. Police put them back behind the barriers, Noonan said.
   At one point, a priest leaving the cathedral was pelted with
condoms.
   Demonstrators said they were trying to stop Law's ``religious
tyranny.''
   ``I was at Boston City Hospital last week where a teen-ager died
of AIDS contracted through sex,'' said Steven Tierney, co-chairman
of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus. ``I think
the church has to take some responsibility for that. They won't let
us teach kids about safe sex.''
   Walsh said those inside the cathedral heard only a ``rumble''
from the demonstrations outside.
   ``Is the church going to change its moral teaching with regard
to sexuality? No,'' he said. ``We've been at this for 2,000 years.
And we will be here as long as it takes.''

<HEAD>Researcher Warns Washington on Entry Restrictions for AIDS
Carriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French researcher who discovered the AIDS virus
demanded Saturday that the United States repeal its ban on granting
entry to people testing positive for the virus.
   The ban has prompted dozens of international organizations and
agencies to call for a boycott of an international AIDS meeting in
San Francisco this week. France and Switzerland have said they will
not send official delegations to the meeting.
   The French researcher, Luc Montagnier, said he would attend the
Sixth International Conference on AIDS, but he said it would be the
last conference on American soil if the United States failed to
repeal the ban.
   ``The American restrictions are completely unacceptable, and it
is being said out loud that we are going only to save this
conference'' Montagnier said in a recording for Canal Sante, a
cable television channel for health professionals.
   ``But it is clear that the next American conference ... which is
to take place in Boston, will not take place if the American law is
not changed,'' he said.
   The Boston conference on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is
scheduled for 1992.
   Montagnier led the French research team at the Pasteur Institute
which discovered the AIDS virus.
   Under a law passed in 1987 by the U.S. Congress, infection with
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, was
added to the list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can
be barred from entering the country.
   AIDS is a deadly disease that attacks the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and
cancers. A person can carry the AIDS virus without having the
disease and its symptoms, though infection in almost all cases
leads to the disease.

<HEAD>AP Launches New Photo System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A revolutionary system for transmitting photos
was showcased for publishers over the weekend, and executives of
The Associated Press called it the most ambitious technical
undertaking in the wire service's history.
   John Reid, vice president and director of communications and
technology for the wire service, said the AP's new PhotoStream was
just in the talking stage three years ago and now the technology is
``right around the corner.''
   ``We're on target, the system is in production and exceeds our
expectations,'' Reid told newspaper executives attending the 62nd
annual technical exposition of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   The AP will begin scheduling the PhotoStream system to its 950
photo members by the end of June, Reid said.
   The new system will be installed at all photo members within two
years, said Dave Tomlin, deputy director of membership.
   ``This is the most ambitious technical undertaking in the
history of AP,'' Tomlin said.
   The system will deliver a black and white print to photo members
in as little as 1 minute, compared to the present delivery time of
9 minutes. Color photos will be transmitted in less than 3 minutes,
compared to the current delivery time of 30 minutes.
   Reid said the photo technology was changing rapidly and
predicted, ``Within two years, we'll look back on the days we sent
one photo per minute and we'll look at that as a long time.''
   Hal Buell, assistant to the president for AP's PhotoStream and
electronic darkrooms, told the executives, ``All of us are entering
a new world of picture handling.''
   Vincent Alabiso, executive NewsPhoto editor, promised that
PhotoStream would ``solve almost every deadline problem associated
with wire photos.''
   He said that a 30-minute color project ``just became 90 percent
quicker'' _ an attraction to editors facing deadlines.
   Tomlin said that PhotoStream ``offers the opportunity to solve
almost all of the photo problems raised by editors.''
   Robert Caspe, president of Leaf Systems Inc., reviewed his
company's new electronic darkroom system which is being offered to
AP members. He said the system would completely automate picture
handling by editors and would increase quality while reducing cost.

<HEAD>Two Suspected IRA members Arrested in Belgium, Netherlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Saturday arrested two
suspected IRA members after a local farmer heard them taking target
practice in woods near the Dutch border.
   Police said they were looking for a third reputed member of the
Irish Republican Army who escaped.
   Authorities identified one suspect as Donna Maguire. She faces
West German terrorism charges dating back to September 1989, Dutch
authorities said.
   Ms. Maguire, 23, was carrying a false U.S. passport when she was
arrested in woods along the Dutch border, 43 miles north of
Brussels.
   She and two men were in the area practicing shooting, Dutch
authorities said.
   Officials said the shots were heard by a farmer who alerted the
police. The woman was arrested, but the two men fled.
   Police said they found a Dutch-registered car containing a
machine gun, explosives and two handguns in the woods where the
three were shooting.
   About two hours later, across the border, Dutch police arrested
an English-speaking man who was ``obviously on the run,'' said
Stephan Worm, a Dutch National Police spokesman. He said the man
was believed to be one of the group of three.
   Worm said the man refused to give his name or make any
statement. He was being held for extradition to Belgium.
   Police on both sides of the border were looking for the other
man.
   A police spokesman in the north Belgian city of Turnhout said,
``We are almost certain that we are dealing with three IRA people.''
   Worm said Ms. Maguire is wanted in West Germany for murder,
attempted murder and setting off explosives in connection with a
terrorist attack in September 1989. He gave no other details.
   The charges may relate to the shooting death on Sept. 7, 1989,
of Heidi Hazell, 26, the German-born wife of a British soldier. She
was shot in her car in Dortmund. The IRA said later it thought she
worked for British security forces.
   Since 1979, the IRA has mounted attacks in Belgium, the
Netherlands and West Germany in the group's campaign to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   The outlawed organization, in a new offensive aimed mainly at
British targets outside Northern Ireland, has killed seven people
in the past few weeks and mounted several attacks in England.
   Last weekend, an IRA bomb injured 17 students at a birthday
party in a bar of a north London barracks.
   In other recent attacks, IRA gunmen shot dead a teen-age
off-duty soldier at Lichfield station in central England and killed
a British army major in West Germany.
   On May 27, at least two IRA gunmen shot and killed two
Australian tourists as they got into their British-registered car
in Roermond, the Netherlands.
   In a statement later, the IRA said it believed the two were
British servicemen stationed in West Germany and apologized for the
``tragic mistake.''

   Niger's ruling council announced Saturday
it would permit ``political pluralism'' but gave no indication if
opposition parties would be authorized.
   Several one-party governments in Africa have reacted to recent
demands for multiparty democracy by saying they would liberalize
management of the ruling party to permit different opinions. This
has been referred to as ``political pluralism.''
   On May 1, President Ali Saibou, pressed by unions to permit
opposition parties, said this West African nation was not ready for
multiparty democracy.
   But in recent weeks, strikes by most of the country's workforce
has forced the government to reconsider the demands.
   Saturday's communique from the ruling Superior National
Orientation Council also reported that 63 Tuareg nomads were killed
in clashes with security forces on May 7.
   The government initially said 30 Tuaregs and seven other people,
including police and civilians, were killed in the clash.
   On Friday, the French newspaper Le Monde carried a front-page
story saying hundreds of Tuaregs, white-skinned desert nomads who
enslaved black Africans in past centuries, had been killed in the
May incident.
   The story quoted Niger Information Minister Khamed Abdoulaye,
himself a Tuareg, as saying that 29 people in his family were
killed in the clashes.
   On Saturday, Abdoulaye said Le Monde had distorted his comments.

   Searchers recovered the bodies of four
people Saturday, bringing to 15 the confirmed death toll from a
flash flood that raged through eastern Ohio, authorities said.
About three dozen people remained missing.
   A 5-year-old Glencoe girl, Tiffany Webb, was found dead in
McMahon Creek early Saturday, said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County
Coroner's investigator. The girl and her 6-year-old brother, Donald
Andrew Webb, were killed when Thursday night's flood swept their
mobile home from its concrete mooring.
   Later in the day, Vogt reported two additional victims, Danny
Humphrey, 8, hometown unknown, and Mary Grimes, age and hometown
unknown. A fourth victim, who was not identified, was discovered in
the Ohio River late in the afternoon, Vogt said about 8 p.m.
   Capt. Jim Boling of the Ohio Air National Guard said the number
of people missing was revised Saturday evening to 34. Previous
reports from Belmont County authorities had given the number as 51.
   Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokesman Ned Martin said some
of those listed as missing had informed relatives or authorities
they were safe. Boling said others found dead may never have been
listed as missing.
   In all, some 700 rescue workers _ including 341 members of the
Ohio National Guard _ are assisting flood victims.
   ``We have 26 dog teams from Maryland, Kentucky, West Virginia
and Athens County, Ohio,'' Boling said. ``They have nearly
completed an initial sweep of the affected area.''
   Boling said 12 boats would search the Ohio River until dusk.
``We also have teams of volunteers walking the banks of the (Ohio)
river.''
   Utility crews and local volunteers used chain saws, axes and
shovels to clear the debris of more than 100 homes destroyed or
damaged by a careening wall of water that washed over the banks of
three creeks.
   Gov. Richard Celeste, who toured the area for the second time
Saturday, repeated how shocked he was at the destruction.
   ``The damage ... was extraordinary. It was something that was
beyond what I've seen from tornadoes and floods. One can only
imagine what it was like,'' Celeste said at a news conference.
``The shock of the wall of water as it roared through a very
confined area literally flattened everything.''
   Celeste said state and federal authorities planned to set up an
emergency assistance center at Shadyside High School.
   Trucks hauled stacks of flattened cars out of a gully south of
the town. State Highway Patrol troopers and National Guardsmen used
the dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the
Wegee and Pipe creeks in Belmont County looking for survivors or
victims.
   Searchers were stunned by the devastation, said Salvation Army
Capt. Ginny Muir.
   ``The mood is like disbelief,'' she said. ``As far as helping,
nobody's getting tired or discouraged.''
   Authorities allowed a few reporters at a time into the most
heavily damaged area but they would not let onlookers downstream,
where the dogs were searching. The search extended five miles south
of Shadyside along the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which empty into the
Ohio River.
   Workers were also sifting through debris that collected at the
Hannibal locks and dam, about 25 miles south of town.
   A cloudburst that dropped 5.5 inches of rain in 3{ hours
Thursday night surged through the low-lying community in the
Appalachian foothills, washing away houses and destroying roads.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday declared
Belmont, Jefferson and Franklin counties disaster areas, making
federal aid available to residents.
   Vogt said most of the victims were from Shadyside and Mead
Township, where the two creeks run south of the village, or
Glencoe, near McMahon Creek.
   A temporary morgue for flood victims was set up at the Bauknecht
Funeral Home In Shadyside, about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va.
   The National Weather Service issued a flood watch Thursday
night, indicating that flooding along small streams and low-lying
areas was possible.
   But Al Wheeler, deputy meteorologist in charge of the service's
Cleveland office, said the service did not issue a flood warning,
which alerts residents to take shelter.
   Wheeler said weather service offices in Cleveland, Akron and
Columbus in Ohio and in Pittsburgh had information showing the
storm had diminished over eastern Ohio when it had actually
intensified.
   Seventeen Ohio counties have been declared disaster areas
because of flooding or tornadoes since May 29.

   The mother of a 12-year-old girl swept
away by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter was
alive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.
   Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen
still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern
Ohio.
   ``She keeps saying Kerri Jo may have amnesia, or she can't move
to get help. That's a mother's hope,'' said the friend, Betty
Kreiter, 67.
   Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the
rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which
empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles
south of this town.
   Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the
Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south.
   Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family,
said the Rev. Robert Gracey, who was counseling flood victims at a
school turned into a relief center.
   Kerri had been playing at a friend's house when the one-story
home suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.
   The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek
and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by
clinging to logs.Amber was released from a hospital Saturday after
treatment for minor injuries.
   She said she last saw Kerri when the two, alone in the house,
jumped into a bathtub for safety in the storm. The tub was washed
into the creek.
   Throughout the town, there were stories of fear, luck and close
calls. Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey,
were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were
reunited about a half-hour later.
   Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others were
in the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.
   ``I saw my husband go under and get washed away. He was yelling
how much he loved me, and then I went under,'' Mrs. Hulderman said.
``I began praying `God, don't let me die like this,' and the next
thing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down.''
   Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at the
mouth of the creek near the Ohio River.
   Capt. James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said local
authorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccounted
for.
   Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two children
fled their two-story house before water washed through. When they
returned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and the
surrounding area ``looked like a big lake.''
   ``I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it was
on stilts on the water,'' Mrs. Schramm said.

   Slow-moving congressional efforts to fashion a
child-care assistance bill are becoming entangled in an
election-year fight to include a $3 billion Social Security break
for senior citizens.
   The child-care assistance plan passed the Senate a year ago and
the House in March and both bills are languishing in House-Senate
conference committee.
   The Social Security plan could make it even more difficult to
fashion a compromise.
   Some GOP lawmakers plan to offer a resolution this week in the
House that would instruct the conferees to go along with an
important _ if largely unrelated _ provision that the Senate added
to its child care bill.
   That provision would raise the annual limit on outside earnings
that Social Security recipients over the age of 65 can have while
still receiving their full government checks.
   Supporters say the change would provide a needed break for the
working elderly. But opponents call it a $3 billion giveaway to
senior citizens that would in effect be charged to the cost of
children's programs.
   They say it has no business in the much-debated child-care bills.
   ``We're going to be dispensing money through the earnings test
that could be used by middle class and working people for child
care,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., a sponsor of the child care
bill and opponent of the Social Security provision.
   ``It comes right out of the pockets of working people and into
the pockets of the elderly,'' Downey said.
   Advocates of increasing the Social Security earnings ceiling say
the limit effectively increases the tax on recipients over the age
of 65.
   They claim a majority of House members as cosponsors on a
separate bill to lift the earnings limit all together.
   Thus far, however, that bill has remained firmly bottled up in
the House Ways and Means Committee, where Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., opposes any such change.
   ``Because of the earnings test, seniors are being forced out of
the work force and into the rocking chair,'' said Rep. J. Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
   Rep. Hank Brown, a Republican Senate candidate in Colorado, was
expected to offer a non binding motion this week to instruct the
House conferees to go along with that Senate provision.
   The motion most likely would be approved, Downey said.
   The Senate, which has no rule barring unrelated amendments on
bills, added the provision on a 100-0 vote last year after it was
offered by Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   It would raise the amount of earnings for people aged 65 to 69
that are exempt from any reduction to $10,560, a $1,200 increase.
Social Security payments for recipients earning more than that
would be reduced by $1 for every $4 earned up to $15,560 in
earnings, instead of the current $1 for every $3 earned.
   Most of the conference committee deliberations have been devoted
to other sections of the complicated and conflicting child care
bills. The House version has been estimated to cost $27 billion
over five years, while the more modest Senate version has been
estimated at $10 billion over four years.
   Jurisdictional disputes among members of Congress have plagued
the bill.
   The House version, passed March 29, provides tax credits that
could be used by working families to pay for child care. It would
also provide money to epand Head Start pre-school services and
establish a new program encouraging school-based before and after
school child care.
   The Senate version, passed June 12, 1989, would provide tax
credits and create a separate grant program for child care.
Opponents say its central grant program would require annual
appropriations and thus is vulnerable to political whim, while the
House version locks in key portions by making them automatically
renewing entitlement programs.
   Rostenkowski has resisted the notion of increasing the earnings
limits for Social Security recipients and is concerned about the
cost, estimated by his committee staff at $3 billion.
   The potential generational conflict comes at a time when the
Ways and Means Committee has just issued a lengthy study of the
impact of federal entitlement programs that suggests children as a
group have suffered economically over the last decade while the
aged have fared better.
   The report said the poverty rate for the aged fell from 15.7
percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 1988, while the poverty rate for
children rose from 18.3 percent in 1980 to 19.7 percent in 1988.

conflict, by death and by assassination,'' Guatemalan President
Vinicio Cerezo said at the opening of the gathering.
   ``We don't want to repeat this history. Now we have to begin
taking other paths,'' he said.
   Cerezo said peace and democracy cannot survive without
prosperity, a key theme of the two-day economic summit.
   The presidents hope to duplicate the success of their regional
peace plan with a concerted development effort, including
attracting substantial foreign support.
   The peace plan helped bring about free elections and an end to
the war in Nicaragua and peace talks between leftist rebels and the
governments of El Salvador and Guatemala.
   ``Central America has to show the world that it ready to
confront underdevelopment and create options for prosperity for its
people the same way it resolved the problem of war in the 1980s,''
said Honduran President Rafael Callejas.
   Callejas, a 46-year-old economist who took office in January,
says Central America needs $2.25 billion over the next three years
to begin rebuilding.
   ``The international community and the Western world should
channel these resources to Central America,'' he said at a news
conference in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa this week.
   Callejas and Cerezo are meeting with Presidents Alfredo
Cristiani of El Salvador, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua
and Rafael Calderon of Costa Rica. Panamanian President Guillermo
Endara is attending as an observer.
   The Central American leaders, concerned about competing demands
from Eastern Europe, are encouraged by Secretary of State James
Baker III's decision to come to Antigua.
   Baker was to arrive late Sunday and will meet with the five
Central American presidents and Endara on Monday.
   He is expected to propose a plan for coordinating aid, trade and
investment from various nations and organizations. The United
States is expected to manage the program with Japan and the
European Community as co-chairs.
   ``In a world of redefined hegemonies, the United States is again
making its claim: This (Central America) is our turf, and there is
no doubt about it,'' one regional development expert said of the
proposal. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The summit's opening was delayed almost an hour _ until halftime
in the World Cup soccer match between Costa Rica and Brazil.
Diplomats, international bankers, development experts, bureaucrats
and reporters huddled around televisions in this colonial city 27
miles from the capital.
   This is the first summit to focus on the devastated economies of
the region.
   Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development
Bank in Washington, said that despite competing national interests,
there are ample possibilities for economic cooperation in the
Central America.
   ``Energy, roads, communications _ these are issues which deserve
a regional approach,'' he said in an interview from the bank's
Washington headquarters.
   Political issues were expected to be raised as well.
   Although negotiations are under way in El Salvador and
Guatemala, peace is still not at hand. Nicaragua is still in the
delicate process of transition from a decade of revolutionary
Sandinista rule to Mrs. Chamorro's promise of a renewed free
enterprise system.

   More than 100 people have died in floods caused
by torrential rains last week in China's southern province of
Hunan, an official daily said Sunday.
   The flooding knocked down about 16,000 homes, killed 2,905 farm
animals and inundated more than 741,000 acres of farmland, the
People's Daily reported.
   It said 39 cities in Hunan province recorded more than 4 inches
of rain in storms between Monday and Friday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported that at one point,
10,000 people were trapped in buildings.
   Southern and central China perennially suffer heavy loss of life
and damage from summer flooding. Last summer, nearly 3,000 people
were killed, half in the populous southwest province of Sichuan.

   A Soviet pilot who was a hero of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster was in critical condition Saturday with a lung
infection, said officials at the hospital where he recently
underwent a bone marrow transplant for leukemia.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, 53, who had been in stable condition after
the April 27 transplant, developed a fever and breathing
difficulties late Thursday, and doctors at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center placed him on a respirator early Friday,
center spokeswoman Susan Edmonds said.
   Grishchenko was sedated and on a respirator, and his doctors
``really don't feel there will be a recovery in the next 24
hours,'' Edmonds said Saturday.
   While doctors still hoped for improvement, there had been none
in the previous 24 hours and that ``is usually a sign that things
are not going to go well,'' she said.
   If Grishchenko survives the night, doctors will assess his case
Sunday, when they likely will decide whether to continue use of the
respirator, she said.
   Grishchenko's wife, Galina, was at her husband's side, Edmonds
said.
   Grishchenko's leukemia was detected late last year. He made four
flights in five days through hot radioactive gases to dump sand and
wet concrete on the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
   The plant, about 80 miles north of Kiev in the Soviet republic
of the Ukraine, exploded and burned April 26, 1986. At least 31
people died in the disaster.
   He underwent the transplant in hopes that healthy marrow could
restore normal blood-cell production.
   The problem is a hard-to-treat lung infection he had before
coming to the Hutchinson Center, Edmonds said. Doctors had tried to
eliminate it with antibiotics, but the infection continued in his
right lung.
   After waiting until the transplant appeared successful, doctors
on Tuesday performed exploratory lung surgery to identify and
remove the source of the infection.
   The surgery appeared to go well, but Grishchenko's condition
began deteriorating late Thursday, Edmonds said.
   It was not known if his worsening condition was related to the
surgery, she said, adding that he will continue to receive
antibiotics.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev praised Grishchenko in a
recent letter as a national hero and a ``brave man who didn't spare
his life in the line of duty.'' The letter was delivered while
Gorbachev was touring parts of Minnesota and California earlier
this month after the summit meeting in Washington, D.C.
   Grishchenko arrived in Seattle from the Soviet Union on April 11.
   ``A lot of people are praying for him,'' said Cap Parlier of
Mesa, Ariz., who arranged the bone marrow transplant. The
light-helicopter testing and evaluation director for McDonnell
Douglas Corp., is a friend of Grishchenko and has closely followed
his treatment.

   Police became suspicious after seeing two men exchange boxes
near a main square. Patrols in the area had been stepped up to keep
order during the World Cup soccer tournament.
   Later searches of cars and houses yielded the manuscripts, rolls
of parchment and sheet music dating from the 12th to 16th centuries.
   They were stolen from a library in the northern Italian city of

   Police arrested Evandro Uzzani, 49, and Raul Andreasi, 40, both
of Turin, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms raked parts of the Midwest Saturday,
causing widespread flooding and at least two deaths in Iowa and
Illinois. Tornadoes destroyed five houses in South Dakota and
ripped through a Nebraska town.
   Hundreds of Iowans were forced to evacuate their homes when up
to 6 inches of rain fell over parts of the state, and roads and
bridges were washed out. An 11-year-old girl was killed when she
was swept into a culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the
Mississippi River, Scott County authorities said.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central
counties disaster areas and sent the National Guard to help sandbag
low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed.
   The Weather Service said more thunderstorms and heavy rain were
likely overnight as a front of moist, unstable air moved through
the upper Midwest.
   In South Dakota, a tornado ripped a nine-mile path through
Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls, damaging 30 to 50 homes,
said Beresford Fire Chief T.A. Mullinex. He said about five homes
were destroyed but no deaths or injuries were reported.
   In Nebraska, a tornado hit the northeastern town of Madison
Saturday night, causing widespread damage just hours after areas
had been evacuated because of flooding, officials said.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant was torn off
by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's phone. She
wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   He said there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in
the community of 2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha. Another
tornado touched down further north near O'Neill earlier Saturday,
damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of severe
storms.
   Heavy rains also lashed western Illinois Saturday. A train
engineer was killed and three people were injured when a Burlington
Northern freight engine derailed at a washed-out bridge near
Morrison, Ill., authorities said.
   ``The train collapsed the weakened bridge and the two engines
with approximately 28 cars began a chain reaction collision,'' said
a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher. ``Workers were trapped in
the engine because they came to rest in about 15 feet of water and
mud from the swollen ditch.''
   The engineer's identity was not released. The injured were
treated at a hospital and released.
   In Iowa, scattered flooding was reported throughout the state.
Branstad declared Polk, Warren, Dallas and Jasper counties in
central Iowa and Johnson, Scott and Muscatine counties in eastern
Iowa disaster areas.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The river was expected to crest at 22 feet on Sunday, 11
feet above flood stage. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter
in central Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly
higher than the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest
at Des Moines near its 1947 record.
   All roads between Des Moines and west Des Moines were blocked
except Interstate 235 and police were going door to door in
low-lying areas offering evacuation help.
   A thunderstorm packing winds of at least 80 mph struck the
Ottumwa area in southeast Iowa shortly after 2 p.m., damaging trees
and at least two homes and downing power lines.
   A new outdoor storm warning system failed when the weather
service asked officials to activate it after a tornado was sighted.
Ottumwa Police Sgt. Jim Clark said the failure apparently was
caused by an electrical power surge from intense lightning.
   Travel was considered extremely dangerous all over eastern Iowa.
   In Cedar County, motorists along Interstate 80 between Durant
and Stockton were trapped inside and on top of floating cars, a
State Patrol spokesman said.

<HEAD>Fire In Winnebago Leaves One Dead, 13 Hospitalized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adults en route from Mississippi to a bingo
game on an Indian reservation jumped from a burning, moving motor
home Saturday. One died and at least 13 were hospitalized.
   Eyewitnesses said about 14 passengers were aboard the Winnebago
when it caught fire about 4 p.m. on Interstate 65 near Creola,
about 21 miles north of Mobile and 40 miles from the Poarch Creek
Indian Reservation.
   ``There was a flash fire inside the vehicle and they abandoned
it while it was going down the road,'' said Jim Teague, Creola
assistant police chief. ``Black smoke came out of the vehicle and
then flames and then people started jumping out.''
   Teague said the people jumped out as the Winnebago traveled
three-fourths of a mile, and suffered abrasions and ``major
trauma'' from the pavement as well as burns from the fire.
   He said police didn't know how fast the vehicle was going or
what caused the fire. Officers were interviewing the passengers at
the hospitals.
   The witnesses said the Winnebago left the highway, went across a
field, through a fence and over a service road before hitting a
tree and coming to a halt, still burning.
   Teague said the witnesses were passengers on a full-sized bus
just behind the Winnebago, also headed to the bingo game.
   The Mobile County coroner's office said one person died from
injuries in the incident but declined to release other details.
   Six of the injured were taken to the University of South Alabama
Medical Center, two by helicopter. Nursing supervisor Doris Willmon
said their conditions ranged from stable to critical.
   Seven others were taken to the Spring Hill Memorial Hospital,
one of whom, a burn victim, was later moved to the medical center.
A Spring Hill nursing supervisor said the remaining six were listed
as stable.
   Teague said the Winnebago was one of four vehicles that left
Biloxi, Miss., to go to the Bingo Palace near Atmore, about 60
miles northeast of Mobile. He said the other vehicles were all
full-sized buses carrying 47 people each. Police could not
immediately determine who owned the Winnebago.

   Mike Tyson made a triumphant return to the ring
Saturday night, knocking out former Olympic heavyweight champion
Henry Tillman with a single, smashing right hand in the first round.
   Tyson then helped the stricken Tillman to his feet.
   It was Tyson's first fight since he lost the heavyweight
championship on a shocking 10th-round knockout to James ``Buster''
Douglas on Feb. 11 at Tokyo.
   Tyson made sure there was going to be no surprise on this
87-degree night before a near-capacity crowd of about 15,000 at an
outdoor arena at Caesar's Palace.
   A 20-1 favorite, Tyson came swarming out of his corner at the
opening bell and kept the pressure on Tyson until the end, which
came at 2 minutes, 47 seconds.
   Tyson, who will be 24 on June 30, scored his 34th knockout in
boosting his record to 38-1. He earned $2 million.
   In another bout on the same card, 41-year-old former heavyweight
champion George Foreman, continuing his improbable try for a world
title, stopped Adilson Rodrigues with a thundering three-punch
combination in the second round of their scheduled 10-round fight
Saturday night.
   Foreman caught Rodrigues with a left jab, then followed it with
a right hand and a left hook that put the Brazilian down. Rodrigues
struggled to get up but was counted out by referee Carlos Padilla
at 2:39.
   Foreman, winning for the 22nd straight time since returning to
the ring three years ago, wasted little time in earning his $1
million payday.

<HEAD>Thai Drug Minister Says US Must Talk With Supply Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials will have to talk with
representatives of the country that supplies drugs through Thailand
to reduce the flow, Thai officials told administration
representatives Friday.
   The Thai officials did not publicly name the country they were
referring to, but Burma is known to be the biggest supplier of
drugs shipped through Thailand. The United States has poor
relations with Burma's military government, which it has sharply
criticized for the country's record on human rights.
   At the National Press Club, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan referred a question on drugs to his minister in charge
of narcotics, Korn Dabbaransi.
   ``The supply itself does not originate in Thailand,'' Korn said.
   ``So if you want to talk to the supply side we'll have to
include a third country. ... If we ... discuss between us and the
United States only, it will never work and the United States will
have to realize that. You will also have to do your own homework
... with the country in question before we can ever hope to reach
any fruitful ultimate target.''
   The State Department has criticized corrupt Thai officials for
letting drugs flow through their country.
   ``Thailand is significant as the primary route for Southeast
Asian heroin bound for the international market,'' it said in its
most recent report on narcotics control in March.
   ``Heroin is refined in Thailand, but in much smaller quantities
than that produced in refineries on the Burmese, and to a somewhat
lesser degree, Lao sides of the border.''
   According to the State Department's figures, Thailand will
produce this year about 50 tons of opium , the raw material for
heroin, while Burma is expected to produce 2,780 tons.
   In a speech to the club, Chatichai said narcotics trafficking
transcends national boundaries.
   ``We must direct our joint effort at both the supply and demand
side of the problem,'' he added.

   A social worker was convicted of child abuse
Friday for helping a couple regain custody of a 2-year-old boy who
died when his father repeatedly dunked him in a toilet bowl during
potty training.
   Margaret Barber, 62, was convicted of felony child abuse and
misdemeanor failure to report suspected abuse in the death of
Bradley McGee in July 1989.
   Ms. Barber was the first Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services caseworker to be convicted of a felony for handling of
official duties.
   Three other state workers were charged with the misdemeanor
count in the case. Two were acquitted, and the charge was dropped
against the third.
   ``This case is not about what Ms. Barber did. It is about what
she did not do,'' Assistant State Attorney John Aguero said in
closing arguments Friday.
   He said Ms. Barber ignored negative professional appraisals of
the parents and warning signs in the home.
   Defense attorney John Liguori called the prosecutor's argument
unfair hindsight.
   ``The state now asks you to Monday morning quarterback the
decision of Ms. Barber,'' he told the six-member jury.
   The child spent most of his life in foster care after he was
abandoned as an infant at a shopping mall. Ms. Barber recommended
he be returned to his parents despite a psychological profile
describing them as ``infantile'' and ``explosive.''
   Bradley's mother, Sheryl Coe, 21, pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder and is serving a 30-year sentence. Stepfather
Thomas Coe, 22, faces a murder trial next month.
   The boy was dunked headfirst in the toilet to punish him for
soiling his diaper. Ms. Barber also was convicted of failing to
report an allegation that the boy's mother forced him to eat human
waste after another potty training setback.
   Ms. Barber faces a maximum five-year prison term at sentencing
scheduled for July 20. Attorneys have said she is unlikely to
receive more than one year.
   Ms. Barber declined to comment after the verdict. She had
testified that Bradley's case was one of about 60 she was assigned
at the time.
   ``I'm not perfect,'' she said. ``There may have been some things
I missed.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand, in a letter released
Friday, said the European Community has improperly allowed English
to become its dominant administrative language at the expense of
French.
   France was ready to help EC bureaucrats ``acquire the linguistic
competence needed to perform their mission,'' Mitterrand wrote in a
letter to Jacques Delors, the Frenchman who is president of the
European Commission.
   Several Conservative members of Britain's Parliament criticized
Mitterrand's letter.
   ``The man's dotty,'' Sir Nicholas Fairbairn said. ``French is
the language of privacy and English is the language of
communication.''
   ``It might not be a bad idea if President Mitterrand took some
English lessons, preferably from Mrs. Thatcher,'' said another
member of Parliament, Neil Hamilton.
   Mitterrand said using French increasingly as an official EC
language was a top priority of his government.
   ``Today, a tendency exists in certain sectors of the commission
to convene meetings of experts who are asked to work only in
English,'' he wrote.
   Mitterrand said many EC documents, including contract offers and
work documents, were issued only in English despite a treaty
calling for multilingualism.
   ``Such practices are not acceptable, and France will continue to
oppose them,'' he wrote. ``France is ready to put at the
commission's disposition the means of enabling its employees to
acquire the linguistic competence needed to perform their mission.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists told senior advisers to
President Bush on Friday that the timber industry has grossly
exaggerated the economic impact of proposals to save the
Northwest's northern spotted owl from extinction.
   The White House officials who heard the environmentalists' story
Friday on Thursday heard from the timber industry.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to declare the
northern spotted owl a threatened species next week, a move that
likely will require vast tracts of land to be set aside for habitat
protection and result in severe reductions in timber harvests.
   Larry Tuttle, director of The Wilderness Society of Oregon, said
the environmentalists were ``very encouraged'' by the tone of the
White House meeting on Friday.
   ``It gave us a chance to debunk some of the numbers that the
timber industry has been using to support their case. Clearly they
are using worst case numbers and in some cases, worse than that,''
he said.
   A panel of government scientists led by Forest Service biologist
Jack Ward Thomas said in April that 8.4 million acres of forests
must be set aside to ensure the owl will survive across its range
of Oregon, Washington and California.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said his agency intends
to institute most of the Thomas plan. The agency earlier projected
if the plan was adopted in its entirety, harvest levels would be
cut nearly in half in the region, resulting in the direct loss of
more than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.
   Tuttle said, however, that the job-loss figures include
unemployment due to causes other than the spotted owl. He said
7,000 jobs are likely to be lost as a result of continued
automation, 7,000 are likely to be lost as a result of changes in
10-year forest management plans already under way and another 7,000
are likely to be lost because private lands have been overcut to
the point less timber will be available.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds `Polar Cap' Seizures, But Warns Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government can proceed with the nation's
largest-ever money laundering case, a judge ruled Friday, despite
claims by holders of frozen bank accounts they were unaware their
dollars were drug-tainted.
   U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt refused defense requests to
dismiss the forfeiture case that rose out of Operation Polar Cap, a
nationwide crackdown on profits allegedly growing from trafficking
by Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   She said prosecutors have established minimal probable cause to
believe about $11 million in 88 Florida bank accounts is connected
to drug profits earned by drug smugglers.
   But account holders have a right to be concerned about the
government's complaint, she said in her 21-page ruling.
   ``Although designed to deprive those associated with the drug
trade of their illicit gains and tools of the trade, forfeiture is
nevertheless a draconian remedy,'' she wrote. ``The government has
alleged only skeletal facts in the complaint that would support any
legal theory of forfeiture.''
   The accounts were among 658 seized in 23 states in April in an
unprecedented crackdown against money laundering. U.S. Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh said agents had for the first time
traced money made in drug sales on the nation's streets directly to
drug traffickers in Colombia.
   The government later released most of the accounts after
conceding they belonged to wealthy individuals and corporations
that traded pesos for dollars on Colombia's unofficial currency
exchange market. The cash was then wired to U.S. banks.
   Lawyers for the account holders asked Nesbitt last week to
dismiss the case, saying their clients are legitimate businessmen
who had no idea the dollars they bought were dumped on the black
market by the cartel.
   But the judge said the account holders must prove their innocent
ownership in court. She promised a speedy trial and scheduled a
status hearing for July 6.
   ``My client and I will continue to fight this gross miscarriage
of justice,'' said Fred Schwartz, an attorney representing
Colombian businessman Marc Levy.
   Schwartz said Levy is a legitimate businessman who has nothing
to do with drugs and was only buying dollars to pay for his
children's education in the United States.

<HEAD>Twins See Double on Grades, Grants</HEAD>

   They graduated from high school just
fractions of a grade point apart, as valedictorian and
salutatorian. In college, they shared summa cum laude honors.
   Now, twins Amy and Anne Frary are getting ready to start
graduate work _ on identical grants, of course.
   This fall, the twins begin pre-doctoral studies in
plant-breeding at Cornell University on National Science Foundation
fellowships worth $38,700 each.
   ``People always say to me is one a little better than the other
and the answer is `no,' '' said their teacher and advisor, Diana
Stein, an associate professor of biological sciences at Mount
Holyoke College.
   The twins are mirror-image. Amy is left-handed and wears
glasses, Anne is right-handed and needs no correction on her
vision. Like many twins, they finish each other's sentences and
don't understand why people find them unusual.
   ``At college we just were biology majors,'' Amy Frary said. ``We
knew we wanted to do something with plants. We just picked it out
of the blue.''
   Four years ago, the twins graduated from Hampshire Regional High
School with grade point averages better than 97 percent. Amy edged
out Anne for valedictorian by a fraction of a point, but the twins
said there was no acrimony.
   ``We're not like that,'' Anne Frary said.
   For the science grant, Stein wrote one recommendation, pointing
out that there were two Frarys applying.
   ``I happened to learn inadvertently ... that NSF sent their two
folders to different panel groups so they were in fact evaluated
separately,'' she said. ``They stand on their own merits.''
   At Mount Holyoke, the twins graduated with a 3.90 grade average,
which made them both summa cum laude.
   Stein said she has advised the twins to get separate mentors at
graduate school, so they can begin to diverge. ``The next stage in
their life they have to go out and find jobs and the job market is
such that the chances are that's when they'll split.''
   Although they look very similar, the twins are not impossible to
tell apart.
   ``It was easy for me because I have a set of identical twin
girls also who are now 28,'' Stein said.
   Amy Frary said name mix-ups are the only thing that annoys her
about being a twin.
   ``It annoys me that people who we went to grade school with all
12 years still can't tell us apart,'' she said.

<HEAD>U.N. Speakers Call for Continued Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. delegates, marking the 14th
anniversary of South Africa's worst riots, declared that sanctions
against its white government should remain in place until apartheid
is abolished.
   The government of F.W. de Klerk has been asking foreign
governments to lift economic sanctions, saying its recent reforms
show that South Africa is changing.
   Some of the U.N. delegates, in their ``Soweto Day'' speeches,
cautiously welcomed the reforms but said the international
community should keep up the pressure by maintaining sanctions.
   The meeting by the Special Committee Against Apartheid was held
one week before black African leader Nelson Mandela addresses the
United Nations. In its recent reforms, the South Africa government
freed Mandela from prison, lifted the state of emergency in three
of four provinces, legalized anti-apartheid groups, and moved to
end some segregation laws.
   The white government has also opened talks on giving the
country's black majority a political role, though it has not
promised to yield to majority rule.
   ``Soweto Day'' marked the 14th anniversary of bloodshed in
Soweto at a protest by black school children complaining about the
use of the Afrikaans language in schools and opposing the apartheid
system. At least one student was killed in an initial clash with
authorities, and the riots that followed left up to 700 people dead
in the following months.
   Security Council President Pierre-Louis Blanc, the French
ambassador, said Friday's ceremony came at a time when major
changes were occurring in South Africa.
   But he added that ``the abhorrent system'' of racial
discrimination remains in place. He called for the total
elimination of apartheid and majority rule before the lifting of
economic sanctions against South Africa.

<HEAD>West Germany Wants to Cut Carbon Dioxide by 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany intends to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide 25 percent within 15 years to combat
global warming known as the greenhouse effect, a government
official said Friday.
   Scientists say the odorless, colorless gas could cause higher
temperatures by collecting on the outer edges of the Earth's
atmosphere and trapping heat within. That process could produce
changes in the world's climate.
   Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said that highly industrialized
West Germany _ with about 61 million people inhabiting an area
roughly the size of Oregon _ now releases 716 million tons of
carbon dioxide a year into the atmosphere.
   Reducing the emissions by 25 percent by the year 2005 would mean
a cut of nearly 180 million tons annually, it said.
   A Cabinet committee group was set up Wednesday to work out
details for the project, said Uwe Fritche. He is a member of the
Enquete Commission, a federal panel of experts that evaluates
policy options on climate change.
   Fritche said officials are also studying ways of drastically
cutting carbon dioxide emissions in East Germany as quickly as
possible after the two countries are united.
   East Germany, which heavily depends on brown coal as an energy
source, has the highest per capita emission rate in the world with
22.4 tons per year per person, the newspaper report said. West
Germany's is about half that level.
   Carbon dioxide is released during the burning of fossil fuels.
   ``It's already clear that energy efficiency will be the main
means to achieve the goal of cutting emissions 25 percent,''
Fritche told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   He said the government is considering taxing emissions to
encourage cutbacks in the industrial and private use of
carbon-dioxide producing fuels, including heating oil.
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has committed her
country to a 30 percent reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions
by the year 2005.

<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last remaining members of the
Douglas family have been laid off from their jobs at the Douglas
aircraft unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp., along with 7,000 other
employees, officials said Friday.
   ``It is tough to be tossed out when your name is on the door,''
said James S. Douglas Jr., ``It is the McDonnell corporation now,
as far as I am concerned. I am very sad that it is over.''
   Douglas, 29, worked for the company for five years. He was laid
off in late May.
   His father, 59-year-old James S. Douglas Sr., son of aviation
pioneer and company founder Donald W. Douglas, worked there as an
engineer and supervisor for 30 years.
   ``He is very hurt,'' the younger Douglas said of James Sr., who
was laid off at the beginning of the month.
   Another son of the founder was asked to step down from McDonnell
Douglas' board last year when he turned 70. A third son retired
from the company's astronautics unit in Huntington Beach several
years ago.
   Douglas Aircraft Co. spokesman Don Hanson confirmed Friday that
no members of the Douglas family remain with the company.
   Donald Douglas founded Douglas aircraft in Santa Monica in 1920.
It was an industry leader until Boeing gained dominance in 1960.
Seven years later, it was bought by McDonnell.
   The company is now controlled by the McDonnell family of St.
Louis, which has tried recently to contain losses at the largely
independently run Douglas subsidiary.
   Douglas Aircraft has lost $306 million during the past 15
months. Its biggest aircraft programs are behind schedule, and it
is still suffering from a management reorganization last year.
   To trim costs, the company started cutting 7,000 jobs, mostly
white collar, at its Long Beach and Torrance plants. Douglas
currently employs 40,500 people in Southern California.
   James Douglas Jr. said he did not think the loss of his job was
due to a struggle for family power.
   ``I don't think there was anything on that level at all. We were
just peons,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The prized Thomas Cole landscape ``The
Garden of Eden'' went on museum display Friday for the first time
ever and 159 years after it was whisked out of sight by a secretive
owner.
   The landscape depicting paradise with Adam and Eve greeting the
morning sun went on exhibit at the Amon Carter Museum, which bought
it recently.
   Curators, who refused to name the seller or the sale price, said
the painting is a masterpiece of color and style that spent most of
the last 159 years locked in a bank vault.
   ``It's never been on public view, never been photographed. It
was last seen in 1831,'' assistant museum director Ervin Lippman
said Thursday. ``That's the extraordinary thing about the
rediscovery of it.''
   Cole is thought to have painted the lush, tropical depiction of
paradise in 1827. It features mountains, towering trees, foliage
and wildlife lit in bright, jewel-like colors.
   Art historians knew of the painting from preliminary drawings,
descriptions, and an engraving of it used as the frontispiece of an
1831 edition of the Bible.
   ``It's an enormously important picture,'' said Cole scholar
Ellwood C. Parry III, of the University of Arizona, Tucson.
   Later, Cole painted a sequential, companion landscape,
``Expulsion from the Garden of Eden,'' which resides at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston.

   It's no bull. Ravioli makers are seeing red
now that their 8-foot plastic mascot Rudolpho has been stolen.
   ``Anyone seen riding or leading a plastic bull should be
identified,'' a police dispatcher told squad cars in the field on
Thursday.
   Police issued the alert for Rudolpho, the molded Fiberglas bull
who had graced the roof of the two-story Homestead Ravioli Co.
until sometime Wednesday.
   The big bovine beast was a familiar site to highway commuters
who passed the building in the city's South of Market Street
district. Ravioli workers often dressed up Rudolpho for the
holidays.
   ``It's not Coit Tower, but it was certainly a landmark for some
people,'' said Andrew Kubersky, president of Homestead Ravioli.
Coit tower is an important San Francisco landmark.
   ``I miss him,'' Kubersky said.
   The company inherited the bull when it moved to the building 11
years ago. Rudolpho was placed on the roof by the meat packing firm
that earlier had occupied the building.
   Kubersky said ``bull'' is actually a misnomer for the
gender-neutral ``Rudolpho.''
   ``We call him a bull, but he's missing some parts,'' Kubersky
said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought-plagued Southern California's major
water wholesaler will use satellite photographs to detect
overwatering of large tracts of land, officials said Friday.
   The project, which begins July 3, will not mean day-to-day
monitoring of overwatering, said Tim Skrove, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 15
million people in six counties.
   Authorities will use the photographs to assess irrigation levels
over an extended period of time, Skrove said.
   ``This isn't an instance where we're going to be spying on
people,'' Skrove said. ``We're going to be spying on water use,
primarily in broad categories such as parks, golf courses,
cemeteries or even residential neighborhoods, but certainly not
individual homes.''
   Where overwatering is detected, water district officials expect
to contact local water districts, subdivision developers or
operators of parks, golf courses or cemeteries to encourage
conservation measures such as landscaping that requires less water,
Skrove said.
   There won't be any new photographs, only pictures taken since
October 1988 by Landsat satellites, which orbit 450 miles above
Earth's surface, said Tracy Walklet, vice president of Terra-Mar
Resource Information Services Inc.
   The Mountain View, Calif., computer software and systems company
will buy, enhance and analyze the photos under an $80,000 contract
approved Tuesday by the water district's board of directors.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this
technology is going to be applied to urban area for gauging water
conservation potential,'' Skrove said.
   Terra-Mar will use the photos to determine the amount of
irrigated land and the intensity of watering in the district's
5,200-square-mile service area, which includes parts of Los
Angeles, Ventura, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.
   Based on the amount of reflected light, vegetation will appear
in different shades of red, with the most lush, heavily watered
vegetation appearing bright red.
   ``What we want to do is categorize the types of vegetation we
have in Southern California and how much water is being used for
them,'' Skrove said. ``Then in the future we will be able to tailor
conservation efforts.''

<TEXT>
   The NAACP has asked the federal Justice
Department to investigate an annual fund-raising event in some
public schools that students have nicknamed ``slave day'' because
classmates ``buy'' one another as servants.
   Students at Upper Lake Elementary School in rural Lake County
also call the day ``seventh-graders rule,'' because the younger
students are allowed to turn the tables on eighth-graders and order
them about for a day.
   But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People call it a form of slavery that violates the Constitution and
civil rights laws.
   ``Slavery was heinous. It wasn't a fun game,'' Dewitt Bussey, a
consultant to the NAACP's Racial Intolerance Task Force, told
reporters Thursday.
   In written statements to federal and state officials, the NAACP
said the Lake County school held its 13th annual ``slave day'' last
month, another is planned this October at Union Lake High School,
and similar events have been held at other schools around the state.
   The events ``only serve to condone the concepts of white
supremacy,'' the organization said in a letter to acting U.S.
Attorney William McGivern. The NAACP asked that the district be
ordered to halt the custom and start new programs in human rights
and ethnic diversity for students and staff.
   Thordie Ashley, another NAACP consultant, said blacks were not
treated differently from other students during the ``slave day''
event.
   Otis Williams, principal of the elementary school, did not
return reporters' telephone calls Thursday. He has been quoted as
saying the school would discontinue the practice. The NAACP also
said school board members had promised to abolish the tradition.
   In its arguments against the practice, the organization cited
statements by Ron Raetz, an Upper Lake High School teacher and
elementary school board member, that he had ``bought'' a high
school senior as part of the event at his school each year. One
year, Raetz told a local newspaper, he ``bought a Mexican kid,
dressed him up in a big sombrero, a serape, and hung a green card
around his neck. It was all in good clean fun.''
   State school Superintendent Bill Honig, who received a similar
complaint from the NAACP last week, said his department was
investigating the practice.

   Bill Nelson had a 25-vote lead Friday in the
recount for Nebraska's Democratic gubernatorial primary, complete
but unofficial tallies showed.
   The recount was required under state law because of the close
margin of the May 15 primary, which showed Nelson with a 41-vote
lead over Bill Hoppner in the seven-man race.
   The winner will challenge Gov. Kay Orr, the nation's first woman
Republican elected governor, in November. Mrs. Orr, who has
received high disapproval ratings in recent polls, is seeking a
second four-year term.
   Even with the recount, the results could be in doubt. Nelson
declined to declare victory, saying he wanted to see the numbers
the state Board of Canvassers certifies.
   The unofficial tallies statewide showed Nelson with 44,655 votes
and Hoppner with 44,630. In most of the state's 93 counties, the
recount produced changes of 10 or fewer votes.
   ``It means it's not a landslide,'' said Nelson, an Omaha lawyer.
``It was about what we expected. ... Listen, as long as it's one
vote that's all that counts.''
   ``There's plenty of time to declare me a winner later if I am,''
Nelson said.
   All figures are unofficial until the state Board of Canvassers
meets to certify the recount totals. Secretary of State Allen
Beermann said the board is scheduled to meet at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.
   Hoppner, an attorney-businessman and former aide to U.S. Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. Saturday
at his campaign headquarters to announce his reaction, said Larry
Grisalano, a campaign spokesman.

<HEAD>Journalists Name Computer Maker in Injury Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight journalists filed a $270 million lawsuit
against a computer maker on Friday, contending they suffered
disabling injuries from using the company's word processors in
newsrooms.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, charged
that Atex Publishing Systems, a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak
Co., was negligent in marketing the computers and had failed to
warn users of the dangers or to develop substitute systems.
   It also alleged that the company ``ignored, suppressed or
disregarded'' medical studies about ``the causal relationship
between the repetitive use of computer systems and cumulative
trauma disorders.''
   The journalists, each seeking $20 million in punitive damages
and $10 million in compensatory damages, included two from Newsday,
two from American Banker and individual staffers at The Associated
Press, New York Newsday, The Village Voice and Discount Store News.
   Three spouses also asked $10 million each for loss of
companionship, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to 11.
   None of the employers were named as defendants. Ruth Marcus, an
attorney for the plaintiffs, said New York state law provides that
workers cannot sue employers for work-related injuries but must
pursue such claims through workmen's compensation.
   Eastman Kodak spokesman John Labella said the company had no
comment, ``as our attorneys have not yet seen the suit.''
   It was the second lawsuit filed in New York this month against
the company, which manufactures computer systems designed for use
in newsrooms. Three reporters and an editor at New York Newsday
demanded $40 million in a negligence suit filed June 4 in Manhattan
Supreme Court, the newspaper reported Friday.
   Marcus said there were ``very few'' such lawsuits to date, ``but
on the other hand it has become a very serious and pervasive
problem.''
   The suit alleged the eight journalists ``developed and suffered
severe, permanent and disabling cumulative trauma disorders, as
well as psychological injuries,'' from repeated use of the Atex
video display terminals.
   It said cumulative trauma disorders included ``repetitive strain
injuries, musculoskeletal and nerve disorders, upper extremity pain
syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other injuries to
the upper extremities.''
   The eight journalists named as plaintiffs are: Susan Harrigan of
New York Newsday, Laurie Garrett and Sandra Peddie of Newsday,
Martha Gioumousis of Discount Store News, Kathy Silberger of The
Village Voice, Wendy Grover and David Neustadt of American Banker
and Anne Buckley of The Associated Press.
   The other plaintiffs are Harrigan's husband, Peter Benjaminson;
Peddie's husband, Brian Quinn, and Neustadt's wife Maisie McAdoo.

   The state Rompres news agency quoted railway official Ion Tica
as saying the last train of miners left Bucharest late Friday night
for western Romania.
   ``Absolutely all the miners left Bucharest Friday night, headed
back to their jobs,'' Rompres said. ``The process of normalization
is continuing. The central areas of the city are quiet. Subways,
street cars, buses and trolley buses are running normally.''
   No miners were visible this morning. But on Friday evening, one
miner said small contingents from each mine would remain in the
capital in case of renewed trouble. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   President Bush said he must ensure the
``integrity of the civil service'' as he vetoed a bill relaxing
51-year-old curbs on the off-duty political activity of government
workers.
   Two days after the Senate upheld his 11th veto, an authorization
bill for Amtrak, Bush cast the 12th veto of his presidency. No Bush
veto has yet been overturned.
   ``The Hatch Act has upheld the integrity of the civil service by
assuring that federal employees are hired and promoted based upon
their qualifications and not their political loyalties,'' he said
Friday in a veto message to Congress.
   Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union, representing federal employees in 16 agencies and
departments, called the veto ``wrongheaded'' and urged the Senate
to override it.

   The blaze aboard the leaking Mega Borg
has been extinguished and firefighters doused the sizzling
supertanker today to avoid a flare-up.
   The fire was put out Friday, but Coast Guard and state officials
warned that the Norwegian ship crippled in an explosion June 8
still posed a threat.
   ``There are no flames. However it's still real hot and if we
walk away from it right now, it may reflash. It's not yet dead,''
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson said.
   The accident left 4.3 million gallons of light African crude in
the Gulf of Mexico _ the fifth worst spill in U.S. history. Tar
balls from a 10-mile long slick were expected Sunday on the Bolivar
Peninsula, about 40 miles east of Galveston.

   Big-city mayors are leading an effort to pressure
the federal government to increase spending on drug, poverty,
housing and other urban problems.
   The mayors opened their annual summer meeting Friday by
denouncing the 1980s as ``a decade of neglect of America's cities''
and attacking Congress and the White House for spending billions on
foreign aid, the savings and loan bailout and other programs while
cutting aid to cities.
   ``We have to do something,'' San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor
said in urging fellow mayors to be more militant in their lobbying
of Congress and the Bush administration. ``Our pleas have been
falling on deaf ears.''
   The host mayor for U.S. Conference of Mayors session, Chicago's
Richard M. Daley, chastised administration officials _ drug czar
William Bennett for one _ who have accused the mayors of whining in
asking for more federal help.

<HEAD>Tonight on PBS, `Ring' Cycle The Way Wagner Wanted It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Wagner never was content just to write
operas _ he longed to control every detail of how and where they
were performed.
   In 1850, immersed in a project called ``Siegfried's Tod,'' he
vowed that this time he would do it HIS way.
   ``I am toying with the boldest of plans,'' the composer wrote to
a friend from Zurich, Switzerland, where he was living. ``I would
have a theater erected here on the spot, made of planks ... and
give three performances _ free of course _ in the space of a week,
after which the theater would then be demolished.''
   Twenty-six years later, ``Siegfried's Tod'' had blossomed into
four operas, a 17-hour epic titled ``Der Ring des Nibelungen.'' And
Wagner had designed and built his own wooden theater, an acoustical
gem with a covered orchestra pit in the town of Bayreuth, Germany.
   There the world premiere unfolded on Aug. 13, 14, 16 and 17,
1876. Wagner had dreamed of presenting the four operas on
successive days, but he realized that would put impossible burdens
on the singers. Since then, most productions have added one more
day off, so a typical ``Ring'' cycle takes six days from start to
finish.
   Now, thanks to television, American audiences can savor Wagner's
marathon masterpiece the way he conceived it. Beginning tonight,
the Public Broadcasing Service will present the Metropolitan
Opera's production on four consecutive nights.
   It's a $5 million undertaking that should please purists and win
new admirers for Wagner's tale of greed, love and redemption set in
a fantastical world populated by mermaids, dwarfs, giants and gods.
   The Met's ``Ring'' has been hailed by some critics for its
faithful approach to Wagner's original intentions and lambasted by
others as stodgy and lacking a modern point of view.
   Some productions nowadays put Wotan, Bruennhilde &amp; Co. into time
tunnels, nuclear holocausts or 19th-century factories. The Met
sticks to Wagner's original settings, which are bizarre enough
without updating.
   Modern stage technology helps. In the first Bayreuth production,
the three Rhinemaidens climbed into an oversize bathing machine for
the opening scene of ``Das Rheingold'' at the bottom of the Rhine
River. At the Met, water is suggested by lighting and a scrim
stretched across the stage.
   The finale, in which a castle collapses, the river overflows and
the home of the gods goes up in flames, looks awesome thanks to the
trickery of producer Otto Schenk, set designer Guenther
Schneider-Siemssen and lighting director Gil Wechsler.
   Thanks to tactful editing, the TV version, directed by Brian
Large, actually offers some advantages over the live performances.
   First and foremost are the subtitles, which help the listener
through those long monologues for which Wagner is notorious. Host
F. Murray Abraham introduces each episode and provides useful plot
summaries.
   In addition, crucial stage effects that tended to go awry in the
theater work perfectly on TV. The anvil that Siegfried breaks in
two with his magic sword sometimes crumpled too soon in the opera
house, but on TV it splits right on cue.
   And singers who sounded vocally stressed in live performance
come off better, because the videotape editors were able to combine
the best moments of several performances from the last two seasons.
This is especially true of tenor Siegfried Jerusalem, who looks
great, acts superbly, but sings erratically in the grueling role of
Siegfried.
   Hildegard Behrens' grace and emotional involvement make her
Bruennhilde memorable, though her voice is not in the league of
heroic sopranos like Kirsten Flagstad and Birgit Nilsson.
   One thing TV audiences definitely won't see is the accident in
which Miss Behrens was hit on the head by a beam that collapsed too
soon at the end of a ``Goetterdaemmerung'' this spring. She was not
seriously hurt but missed several later performances.
   Other standouts include basses James Morris, a handsome,
rich-voiced Wotan, and Matti Salminen, a thundering, malevolent
Hagen; baritone Ekkehard Wlaschiha and tenor Heinz Zednik as the
deliciously repellent dwarf brothers Alberich and Mime; and mezzo
Christa Ludwig, past her vocal prime but still compelling as both
Fricka and Waltraute.
   As the incestuous brother-and-sister Siegmund and Sieglinde, who
enter the story Tuesday in ``Die Walkuere,'' tenor Gary Lakes and
soprano Jessye Norman sound beautiful. But they are far too amply
proportioned to look or act the parts of impetuous young lovers,
especially in closeup.
   A couple of minor vocal notes: On Wednesday, in Act Two of
``Siegfried,'' we get to hear, but not see, the lovely Dawn Upshaw
chirping away as the Forest Bird. On Thursday, in the prologue to
``Goetterdaemmerung,'' pay attention to the Third Norn. She's a
young soprano named Andrea Gruber who's destined for bigger and
better things.

<HEAD>Activists Call For Riots And Promise Demonstrations At AIDS
Meeting</HEAD>

police comment; PICKS UP 8th graf pvs, ``As Kramer ...''</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A prominent AIDS activist is calling for riots
at this week's Sixth International AIDS Conference, and while most
demonstrators won't go that far, many have promised to disrupt the
meeting with protests inside and outside the convention hall.
   The call for riots came from Larry Kramer, one of the founders
of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP.
   It is the most militant AIDS organization. And Kramer may be its
most militant member.
   In articles published in gay newspapers around the country,
Kramer wrote, ``Every human being who wants to end the AIDS
epidemic must be in San Francisco ... screaming, yelling, furiously
angry, protesting at this stupid conference. WE MUST RIOT!''
   ACT UP is a grass-roots group without leaders or a hierarchy. It
was founded in New York in 1987, and now has perhaps 2,000 members
there. Twenty-five chapters have sprung up across the country, some
with several hundred members.
   Of the conference organizers, Kramer said, ``My feeling is these
are the same idiots putting on this conference who have bumbled the
epidemic for 10 years and made mistake after mistake.
   ``If you really want my gut feeling,'' he said in an interview
last week, ``I think the war against AIDS has been lost.''
   San Francisco police say they expect demonstrations at the
convention, but no violence.
   ``Outside of Mr. Kramer, we don't know of anybody talking riot
or violence,'' said Sgt. Jerome Senkir. ``We're hoping for a
peaceful conference. I think at this point that's going to happen.''
   As Kramer pointed out in his articles, the AIDS meeting, which
begins Wednesday in San Francisco, provides an unparalleled
opportunity for activists to deliver their message.
   Some 12,000 scientists and 1,800 members of the news media are
registered to attend. The conference was established as an annual
forum for presentation of the latest scientific reports on AIDS,
but increasingly is becoming the target of protests.
   Last year in Montreal, the opening of the conference was delayed
for an hour when 200 activists seized he podium to demand better
access to AIDS drugs and an end to discrimination. Peaceful
demonstrations continued later outside the convention center.
   Larger and more disruptive demonstrations are expected this year.
   Some protesters will remain outside the meeting, boycotting the
conference to protest a policy that allows the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to bar foreigners infected with the AIDS
virus.
   The New York chapter of ACT UP will not boycott the meeting. At
least 50 of its members have registered, and they promise to carry
their protests inside.
   Protests are liable to occur ``at the most visible events, or at
anything where a Bush administration official or a member of the
executive committee is at the podium,'' said Peter Staley of ACT UP
New York.
   The ``executive committee'' is a group of scientists that sets
policy for the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the government's program
for testing new AIDS drugs. It is run by the National Institutes of
Health.
   ``There will be two major messages we'll be trying to deliver
there,'' said Staley. ``First off is the rage our community is
feeling now with the INS.'' Secondly, he said, ``We want to deliver
the message to the scientific community that they have failed thus
far in reducing AIDS to a chronic manageable disease _ from the
death sentence that it is now.''
   ACT UP has become adept at organizing angry demonstrations. Its
most recent protest occurred at the National Institutes of Health.
A thousand activists gathered there in May to demand increases in
federal AIDS research; eighty-two were arrested.
   Even before the demonstration, the National Institutes of Health
was so upset by ACT UP's criticisms that it took the unusual step
of sending science reporters a detailed, 30-page response.
   ``Like it or not, we've got a debate going about the
government's AIDS research effort,'' said Staley. During the May
demonstration, ``there was debate in the corridors of the NIH,'' he
said. ``Arguments broke out as to whether we were right or wrong.''
   At the same time, ACT UP has worked quietly behind the scenes to
help change government policy. Its members now are consulted by the
NIH and the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``We seem to have access to anyone we want,'' said Charles
Franchino, a member of the ACT UP's treatment and data committee.
``When we meet with government people, there's the specter of 3,000
people standing behind us. And that's what's gotten us in the
door.''
   Kramer's call for riots has divided activists. It was criticized
by gay and lesbian groups in San Francisco.
   ``San Francisco is not an angry town like New York is,'' Kramer
said.
   One group there, he noted, plans a quiet candlelight protest,
but militants elsewhere have put the city on notice.
   ``I do know that the city is terrified that there really are
going to be riots, and I suspect it will be very much a police
state for those days,'' he said.
   ``After Montreal, there was a lot of hope. This year there is a
lot of despair, because that hope has simply not appeared.''
   Drugs continued to be tested slowly in a rigid system, Kramer
said. And for many people with AIDS, it already is too late.
   ``We're talking about another savings and loan scandal,'' he
said. ``We're all going to wake up and it's going to cost $500
billion.''
   New York state has just reported that its annual expenses for
AIDS care topped $1 billion for the first time last year. In 10
years, researchers have projected that one in 24 people in New York
City will have AIDS. A new AIDS infection occurs in the United
States every minute.
   ``The figures are grotesque and no one's paying attention to
them,'' Kramer said.
   In a letter to activists who opposed his call to riot, Kramer
wrote, ``You are free not to riot and you are free to criticize my
call to riot ...
   ``And we are all free to die.''

   ``Cross Creek belongs to the wind and the rain, to the sun and
the seasons, to the cosmic secrecy of seed, and beyond, to all
time.''
   _ Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, with her
endearing portraits of rural Florida life and people, belongs to
her adopted state.
   Now, efforts are being made, including a federal lawsuit, to
return all the manuscripts of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning
author to the University of Florida library, as instructed in her
will.
   Rawlings' widower, 89-year-old Norton Baskin, recently filed
suit against the Seajay Society, a non-profit literary group in
Columbia, S.C. The group has one of Rawlings' unpublished novels,
some short stories and 81 letters that he wants returned.
   Rawlings is well known for her depictions of ``Florida
Crackers''; her 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``The
Yearling,'' the tale of a boy and his deer in the Florida
wilderness; and ``Cross Creek,'' stories of the Alachua County
community where she lived from 1928 until her death in 1953. She
wrote in the character-speaking vernacular that Mark Twain had
utilized so well.
   When she told her housekeeper, Martha, about winning the
Pulitzer, the woman replied, ``Well, ain't that nice? Bet nobody
else at Cross Creek got one.''
   Her home at Cross Creek is a state museum, preserved as it was
when Rawlings did her writing there.
   Rawlings was born in Washington, D.C., in 1896 and educated in
Wisconsin. She worked as a journalist in New York state, but gave
it up in 1928 to live and write on the 72-acre citrus orchard she
bought in Cross Creek. It was the same year Ernest Hemingway
arrived in Key West.
   Her first husband, Charles Rawlings, was also a journalist. They
divorced, and she met Baskin, a hotel owner, several years later.
They married in 1941, and had a second home in St. Augustine where
she died of a brain hemmorrage.
   Rawlings' life and work were portrayed by Mary Steenburgen in
the critically acclaimed movie ``Cross Creek,'' in which Baskin
played a minor role.
   The state regents granted the university permission to either
join Baskin's suit or file suit on its own to recover the
manuscripts.
   A decision will be made in the next few weeks, according to
Barbara Wingo, associate legal counsel for the university, on how
the university plans to proceed. ``We will use what we consider the
best way to get the manuscripts back and have them published,'' she
said.
   The unpublished manuscripts Baskin is seeking to recover include
numerous short works from the 1920s and a 1928 novel, ``Blood of My
Blood.'' The items were stored for 26 years at the Massachusetts
home of Julia Scribner Bigham, Rawlings' longtime friend and
executor of her literary works.
   Under provisions of Rawlings' will, the university has the right
to any published and unpublished manuscripts and literary property,
Wingo said.
   Bigham's heirs found the works in 1987 and the Seajay Society
obtained the works for $12,500.
   Steve Matthews, a member of the Seajay Society, said the works
were given to Bigham by Rawlings and were not part of the Rawlings'
estate.
   A lawsuit is being contemplated, Wingo said, because extensive
negotiations with the society have failed to produce any results.
``They are not going to give them up,'' she said.
   The society is dedicated to enhancing awareness of, and
appreciation for, ``unduly neglected aspects of Southern writers
and Southern culture,'' Matthews said.
   Some of the Rawlings' works held by the society are from as
early as 1914 and were probably written for a creative writing
class. Others were written at the start of her literary career in
Van Hornesville in upstate New York.
   Baskin said his wife's writings are important to understanding
her progress as a writer. They should be returned to the University
of Florida, he said.
   ```Blood of My Blood' ... it's a very personal thing. It's
Marjorie's life,'' Baskin said.
   Rawlings submitted the manuscript to the Atlantic Monthly Press
in a competition. It is a story about the tense relationship
between the author and her mother.
   The Seajay Society wanted to publish ``Blood of My Blood''
through the University of Florida press, but was denied permission
by Baskin, Matthews said.
   The University of Florida library is eager to get the
manuscripts, said Sam Gowan, associate director for collection
management. Retrieving the Rawlings' manuscripts, he said, is
important to both the library and to scholars of the author.
   That would allow researchers to find most of her works under one
roof.
   ``I think what is really most important is that the library
feels it is the depository of record,'' he said.

   The ferris wheel at an amusement park turns
riderless in the wind. And the eyes of children stare unknowingly
at a cameraman whose free hand holds a Geiger counter registering
off the scale.
   Visitors to the photo exhibit of Igor Kostin, the first Soviet
photographer on the scene of the April 26, 1986 explosion at the
Chernobyl power plant, are greeted by the images of burn victims,
rescue workers and the contaminated rubble. It is a testament to
the world's worst nuclear accident.
   There are the melancholic strains of Mozart, Bach and Beethoven,
and the darkness of a black tunnel representing the fallen cooling
tower at the plant, which was among Kostin's first sights when he
arrived there 11 hours after the explosion and fire.
   ``This is definitely not art,'' said Kostin, a 53-year-old
industrial designer turned photographer. ``It can't be a piece of
art because it was such a terrible thing. It's a historical tragedy
for our people and a warning for other people that this could
happen anywhere.''
   Kostin was in Baltimore to kick off the U.S. tour of his
exhibit, ``Chernobyl: Not to Be Forgotten.''
   About 100 black and white and color photos are arranged in
chronological order, beginning with the destroyed building of
Reactor 4, the arrival of rescue workers and nuclear power
officials and the cleanup operation, and ending with more recent
photos of the Chernobyl trial, protests in Kiev, residents who
either have refused to leave the 18-mile danger zone or are
awaiting government relocation, and deformed animals and
contaminated crops in the area.
   But next to the devastating scenes of hospital patients,
abandoned homes and the silent amusement park in the nearby village
of Pripyat are Kostin's testimony that life continues _ photos of a
woman giving birth to the first post-Chernobyl baby, a new housing
settlement built for evacuees and a man standing defiantly outside
his contaminated home with a sign that reads, ``Attention
countrymen and soldiers: Do not destroy this house. We live here.''
   The exhibit ends with a brief photocopied statement from Kostin:
``When I think back, it seems as if it were yesterday. I can hear
the noise of the helicopter and I can see the people who had to
leave their homes taking with them only a cat or a kitchen pot as
they fled from the danger. Then I think, Did it all really happen?''
   ``When people look at the photographs, each person sees
something different, but I want them to see what I saw there four
years ago and since,'' he said. ``The reaction of all people has
been the same _ the sorrow is the same and they have the same
tears.''
   Kostin, who lives in Kiev, about 60 miles from the plant,
continues to return to the danger zone despite the health risk.
   ``I went there the first time because I just had to see with my
own eyes, and I took my camera so other people could see,'' said
Kostin, a photographer with the Soviet news agency Novosti. ``I go
back now because it is a magnet drawing me. Someone has to continue
to go back into the affected area, to show the world that there are
still people living there, to show that it never should have
happened and that it must never happen again. I've already been
exposed. That's my job now.''
   According to official Soviet figures, 31 people were killed in
the explosion and fire at the Ukrainian plant, although a Soviet
newspaper has speculated the death toll could be as high as 250.
The Soviet government has said it plans to continue to relocate
villagers from the contaminated area, but there is little money for
housing.
   Kostin said the government has been cooperative in allowing him
to show the photographs and to travel with the exhibit.
   ``Five years ago I couldn't even think about this,'' he said.
``I'm happy to live at a time when I can show what I've done and
can tell what I have to tell.''
   But when it comes to telling his story, Kostin said he prefers
to let the photographs stand alone.
   ``If I have anything more to say, it would be this: I would like
to give a gift to the American people and to the people of the
world _ an armful of uncontaminated flowers from a clean field in
the Ukraine. I wish I could say it didn't happen.''
   The exhibit, which already has toured four cities in Italy and
Austria, will be in Baltimore through mid-June. Susu Erca, of
Imago, the Italian firm sponsoring the exhibit, said negotiations
are continuing with Boston and Portland, Ore., but the next stop on
the tour has not been confirmed. Depending on its reception in the
United States, the exhibit is expected to be on tour for a year,
Erca said.
   Proceeds from the exhibit, which has a $1 entry fee, will help
establish the Igor Kostin Fund for Children of Chernobyl, Erca
said. The fund will go toward medical supplies for hospitals within
the danger zone.

<HEAD>Rap With a Sense of Humor From a College Grad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Marvin Young was dutifully doing
his economics homework two years ago at the University of Southern
California, he thought that after graduation he would settle down
to the 9-to-5 desk job grind.
   But somewhere along the line he became Young M.C.
   Today the rapper not only has an economics degree, he also has a
top-selling album and single, a pair of music awards and a
promotion deal with Pepsi.
   ``I didn't intend to get into the music business the way that I
did. It was just luck _ it was kind of fate _ that it happened,''
he said. ``I intended to go to college and get my degree, then get
a regular job and use that money to put out my records and then see
what happened from there.''
   In the past year, Young M.C. has won an American Music Award for
best new rap artist, and a Grammy Award for best rap performance
with the song ``Bust a Move.''
   His album, ``Stone Cold Rhymin','' has gone double platinum _
selling over 2 million copies. He also wrote the hit songs ``Wild
Thing'' and ``Funky Cold Medina'' for fellow rapper Tone Loc.
   And he recently made a deal with Pepsi to promote ``cool cans,''
stylized versions of the soft drink's traditional can, over the
summer.
   Not bad for someone who is just 22. However, Young M.C. hasn't
settled down in the music business just yet. He wants to use his
bachelor's degree in economics to go even further.
   ``Going out now and being Young M.C., and all the records and
the awards and whatever the case may be, it's good now for the way
I'm thinking, but in the future it also is a building block for me
to be a competent executive in the business,'' he said.
   Dressed in a black running suit before his recent Worcester
appearance with pop-duo Milli Vanilli, Young M.C. said his music is
purposely lighter than some other rap songs that have drawn
criticism for controversial lyrics.
   ``Bust a Move'' is a case in point. The song follows the
humorous path of boy meets girl _ almost.
   ``It's like, OK, a guy sees a girl and wants to talk to that
girl _ don't be shy, go up to her _ `Bust a Move.' It's just that
simple, instead of getting deep and graphic and all of that. To me
it's unnecessary.''
   Other rappers, most notaby groups such as N.W.A., Public Enemy
and 2 Live Crew, have come under fire for music that is fueled by
racial, social and sexual issues.
   ``It's not the subject matter. It's not the fact that people
will get on a record and say, `the government is unjust,' or `black
people are being mistreated,' because if you say it like that it's
not that offensive,'' Young said.
   ``But when you swear, or when you degrade other races, or
degrade women, or get violent and talk about killing people, that's
what is found offensive.''
   Young M.C. said he keeps controversy out of his lyrics because
of his fans, and he wants to establish an audience before he starts
voicing his opinions. ``The thing about it, to me, is that you go
at your own pace,'' he said. ``You don't beat people over the head
with the things you want to say. And you also don't say it in a way
to challenge or offend anybody.''
   Young M.C. was born in London but grew up in Queens, N.Y. By the
time he reached high school, he was already writing the songs that
would eventually make up about half of ``Stone Cold Rhymin'.''
   Then, two years ago, a single and somewhat unconventional
audition led Matt Dike and Mike Ross to sign Young M.C. to their
``Delicious Vinyl'' record label.
   ``I just rapped for them over the phone _ and they signed me. It
all happened really fast,'' he said.
   Since that fateful phone call, Young M.C. has become known as
something of a prodigy in the music business. He wrote ``Wild
Thing'' for Tone Loc in 35 minutes, and ``Funky Cold Medina'' in
under an hour. ``Bust a Move'' took a mere hour-and-a-half, and it
remained on Billboard magazine's hot 100 singles chart for more
than 40 weeks. And all of the writing took place while he was still
at USC.
   ``See, that's what happens when you're in college and you're
hungry and you're sick of professors and classes,'' he joked.
   Despite his Cinderella-like launch in the business, Young M.C.
is not about to turn into a pumpkin and fade into obscurity. He
says the same about his medium _ rap is here to stay, regardless of
the critics who believe it is a passing musical fad.
   ``There is no way it's going to die out. It's a young people's
music. It's just like how folk music was in the '60s,'' he said.
``You can get a lot more thoughts across with more words. And
there's a lot more words to a rap song than there is to a singing
song.''
   Now the pressure is on to make more hit records.
   But the fame hasn't gone to his head. If anything, it's made him
hungrier.
   ``When people talk to me and say `you've made it' or something
like that, I don't feel like I've made it. Two or three albums down
the line if I still have the same appeal I have now, then that's
what I'm talking about,'' he said.
   ``You have a lot of artists come out and they have great albums
for one year, then two or three years down the line you don't know
where they are.''
   In the meantime, Young M.C. is looking with amazement at his
sudden success. He never thought he'd achieve all this when he was
sitting at his dorm-room desk pondering figures and formulas.
   ``I was an economics major and now I'm rapping for a living'' he
said with a laugh. ``It doesn't seem to follow.''

<HEAD>GOP Candidates Standing Firm Against Taxes Even as Bush Wavers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Bob Smith has won three House races
stressing his opposition to higher taxes. The New Hampshire
congressman isn't about to drop a winning strategy just because
George Bush is wavering.
   If the president changes course, ``I'll disagree with him
point-blank,'' says Smith. He's counting on the ``no new taxes''
theme to sweep him into the Senate this year.
   Rep. Bill Schuette wears a ``keep-the-pledge'' button as he
campaigns for the GOP Senate nomination in Michigan. Presidential
backpedaling on taxes doesn't bother him _ as long as the debate
keeps generating publicity for his own views.
   ``It is in the newspapers all across the state _ taxes are being
discussed in Washington, where does Bill Schuette stand, foursquare
against raising taxes,'' Schuette said. ``Frankly, it helps me.''
   Sound and fury over flag-burning have overwhelmed the nation's
political debate in the past week. But the average citizen is more
likely to be affected by a quiet series of budget talks in
Washington that are likely to produce higher taxes _ Bush's famous
campaign promise notwithstanding.
   Even as Bush edges away from his ``read my lips'' campaign
rhetoric, Republican candidates who have staked their careers on
the ``no new taxes'' pledge are embracing it as tightly as ever.
   Publicly, they won't concede anything _ even that Bush has
softened his position. They say he's merely done what was necessary
to open a dialogue with Congress on the budget.
   Last week a business lobbyist at a lunch with Rep. Hank Brown,
another GOP Senate candidate, said higher taxes on gas, tobacco and
liquor appear to be ``a done deal'' among the budget negotiators.
   ``Am I wrong?'' the lobbyist asked hopefully.
   ``You surely don't believe the president of the United States is
going to break his word?'' Brown replied lightly.
   But Bush entered into discussions with Congress by saying there
were no preconditions on the talks, and most analysts expect tax
increases to be part of any agreement. Presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater confirmed the impression last week when he
accidentally referred to the sessions as tax negotiations, later
correcting the word ``tax'' to ``budget.''
   ``The best thing Republicans can hope for right now is for the
administration to support some non-tax taxes like user fees, sin
taxes, possibly even an increase in the (income) tax rate on the
very wealthiest,'' said analyst Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The
Political Report.
   Brown, running for an open Colorado seat, agrees the dilemma may
be ``finessed'' that way. But he and other no-tax candidates don't
see much difference between general tax hikes and the narrower
measures that seem to be on the table. Any tax increase is anathema
to them.
   Their resistance is understandable, given the enormous success
Republicans have had with campaigns against ``tax-and-spend''
Democrats. The issue continues to look strong.
   In a Gallup poll last month, for example, 36 percent of those
questioned said they'd be less likely to vote for a senator or
congressman who had supported a tax increase. The figure was 42
percent among Republicans.
   California voters' approval this month of a doubled gas tax at
first was interpreted as a sign that the tax revolt is over. But
now analysts say it signals only that middle-class voters are
willing to pay more for something they want _ in this case, better
roads.
   Bush's sudden veer away from his hard-line anti-tax rhetoric
caught Republican candidates unawares, and none were more exposed
than the eight House members giving up their seats to run for the
Senate.
   But the shift at the top has not cost them a potent issue, as
they had feared. Many, like Schuette, are discovering that it
carries unexpected dividends.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., challenging Democratic Sen. Paul
Simon, said her surprise at Bush's move ``was later overcome by my
delight. It certainly allowed me to make my position clear, which
is always nice. It gave me advantages that at the first blush I
didn't think were going to be there.''
   Bush's shift ``constantly comes up'' on the campaign trail, says
Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``I simply say that I have never voted
for a tax increase in the 10 years I have served in the U.S. House.
I will not vote for a tax increase now. I am disappointed that my
president ... is willing at least to begin some consideration of
possible tax increases.''
   In the event Bush agrees to a budget package that raises taxes,
there will be no shortage of candidates to remind him of his broken
promise. If people vote for higher taxes, says Smith, ``so be it.
But they didn't vote for it in 1988. That was the theme of the
campaign.''

<HEAD>Dispute in Obscure Belgian Stock Market Has Profound Implications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER R. GREIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading in Belgium's bourse never has
been high-profile, but a dispute over control of market-moving
information here has grabbed attention of brokers and regulators
far beyond the borders.
   The stock exchange is battling a group of Belgian and
international news outlets over who has the right to release news
first.
   The news group has accused the exchange of seeking to monopolize
the news, violating the European Community's fair competition rules
and press freedom. The group includes Reuters Ltd., the largest
financial information reporting service.
   The exchange has said it wants to level the playing field for
market participants by becoming a clearinghouse for
market-sensitive corporate news under a stock market reform bill
now under government review.
   Presently, companies release news to the exchange and the press
at the same time. Under the reform, only the exchange would get the
news, then release it to investors and traders through a datbase to
which the media could subscribe.
   Although some say this is strictly a domestic fight, others fear
it could have more profound implications for trading elsewhere,
especially in view of other events that suggest the world is moving
to 24-hour global trading.
   The 12-nation European Community is scrutinizing the Belgian
dispute with special concern because it plans a community-wide
trading system after 1992. The system presumably would have uniform
rules for disclosure of information that could affect stock prices.
   The debate over the issue already has led the Belgian government
to review the stock market reform plan.
   ``We are taking this very seriously,'' said Bernard Snoy, an
aide to Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt.
   Reuters and several Belgian media groups have complained to the
government the stock market is misinterpreting the bill. They argue
that if the bourse gets to handle corporate news before the media,
this will violate EC laws on clarity in corporate matters and fair
competition.
   They say the stock market cannot get company news to the public
quickly. They also say it can't be done without risking insider
trading abuses, in which stock market insiders can act on corporate
news before others can.
   ``This could institutionalize insider trading,'' said Herman
Smedts, manager of electronic information at the Financieel
Ekonomische Tijd, a financial daily.
   But bourse officials say their method avoids insider trading by
giving the bourse a chance to suspend dealings in a company stock
before the information is released.
   Also, they say, by releasing news after trading has closed they
can assure all investors will see reports in the media the next day
and can act on it simultaneously when trading reopens.
   ``We are mainly concerned that information gets to all people at
the same time,'' said Jean Peterbroeck, head of the Brussels stock
market commission, a panel intended to make sure the exchange
functions in an orderly manner.
   There is also money at stake.
   The bourse, a non-profit outfit, has created BDB, its own
database service. The media groups say that by channeling
information to BDB, the exchange gets a monopoly on news and gets
to finance the computer trading system the Brussels bourse bought
in 1988.
   ``It's partially true we are out to make money,'' said BDB
General Manager Jean-Pierre Monmart.
   ``But we never had the idea of monopolizing (market news).
Organizing, yes. Monopolizing, no.''
   The media groups, fearful of losing customers, point to the New
York Stock Exchange as an example of how the stock market could set
its news policy.
   The NYSE requires companies to release their news to the
exchange and to Reuters and the Dow Jones Co. _ the world's two key
financial news groups _simultaneously. The Paris and Frankfurt
exchanges have similar rules.
   For their part, the Brussels bourse points to the London
International Stock Exchange, which gets a first crack at corporate
news.
   Brussels also says the media have ulterior motives.
   Reuters, which already receives instant data on stock prices,
volumes and some price bids, wants access to even more exchange
information.
   ``They could only want that to mount their own trading system''
to supplant conventional exchanges, said one bourse official, who
asked not to be named.
   Reuters says it only wants the same type of information other
markets provide. It and the other media groups proposed creating a
cooperative, owned by information vendors, to replace BDB.
   The two alternatives _ one requiring simultaneous disclosure,
the other giving a stock exchange precedence _ are likely to be
debated as exchanges across the EC work to establish a
Community-wide stock trading system.
   Sources said the EC federation of stock exchanges has agreed in
principle that their Price Information Program for Europe (PIPE)
would resemble the London stock exchange. Media groups have said
they will challenge that.

<HEAD>Khrushchev, Rusk Sons Chronicle Fathers' Careers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dean Rusk and Nikita Khrushchev, two leaders
of the Cold War, now have something else in common: sons who are
offering assessments of their fathers' roles in both war and peace.
   Richard Rusk, in what he calls ``my attempt to know my aging
father,'' interviewed the former secretary of state for long hours
with a tape recorder rolling.
   Sergei Khrushchev, describing himself at one point as ``a
witness to my father's meditations,'' chronicled the last seven
years in the life of the Soviet leader who was driven from power in
1964.
   ``As I Saw It,'' by Dean Rusk as told to Richard Rusk, will be
published June 25 by W.W. Norton &amp; Company.
   ``Khrushchev on Khrushchev: An Inside Account of the Man and His
Era,'' by Sergei Khrushchev is scheduled for June 28 publication by
Little, Brown and Company.
   Nikita Khrushchev was a coal miner's son who rose through the
ranks of the Soviet bureaucracy, holding power for 11 years as
Communist Party chief and six years as premier before being
deposed. He died in 1971.
   Rusk, 81, lives in Athens, Ga. He was secretary of state from
1961 to 1969 and was, as his son says, ``an architect of a war that
killed 58,000 Americans and nearly a million Vietnamese.''
   He was with President Kennedy at the summit in Vienna in June
1961, when, in his words, Khrushchev ``set out to intimidate this
new, young president of the United States.''
   Sergei Khrushchev's view is different: ``The main thing I recall
happening at Vienna was that the two men got acquainted. Father
returned to Moscow after the summit with a very high opinion of
Kennedy.''
   Rusk encountered Khrushchev again after going to Moscow in July
1963, to initial a limited atomic test ban treaty. At the Soviet
premier's villa on the Black Sea, they batted a badminton bird back
and forth with no net and no lines on the floor.
   After his downfall, Khrushchev was all but forgotten in the
Soviet Union _ pictured, his son recalls, as ``a dimwitted hooligan
cast upon the throne by fate.'' Only recently has the
rehabilitation of his image begun.
   Rusk, although he held office longer than any secretary of state
since Cordell Hull and retired to an honored professorial chair in
his native Georgia, had his detractors, too.
   Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, a Kennedy White House aide,
found him ``the perfect number-two man'' _ ``a baffling leader''
who had ``authority but not command.'' As Richard Rusk sees it,
Schlesinger was suggesting ``that Rusk wasn't smart enough for the
job.''
   Staying on in the Johnson administration after Kennedy's death,
the State Department veteran became increasingly a target for
opponents of the Vietnamese war.
   The young Richard Rusk, a student at Cornell, found himself
``caught between love for my father and the growing horror of
Vietnam,'' unwilling to volunteer and unwilling to embarrass his
father by joining the antiwar movement.
   In a tape-recorded session two decades later, he pressed Rusk on
the point and found him ``unprepared ... for admitting that
thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.''
   For the elder Rusk, there were no doubts: ``Because of this
nation's commitments, I had a duty to perform: to try to prevent
North Vietnam from overrunning South Vietnam by force. That was my
job. And I tried to do it.''
   The taciturn Rusk and the voluble Khrushchev both at first
resisted the idea of writing their memoirs.
   ``All we wanted to do was to get him involved in some kind of
project,'' writes Sergei Khrushchev. ``Father didn't respond to our
first suggestions. Sometimes he laughed them off.''
   When he did agree to tape record his memoirs, Soviet authorities
of the time resisted publication, but the material was published
widely abroad. As Sergei Khrushchev's own book neared publication,
he was seeking to have a Russian edition of his father's memoirs
published ``so as to restore his good name.''
   Rusk vowed when he took office in 1961 that he would never write
his memoirs, saying he would leave it to the historians.
   In a preface to Richard Rusk's book, however, he tells how his
son ``came home to Georgia after many years in Alaska, years spent,
I now realize, attempting to understand and make peace with the
events of his youth and of my public service.''
   ``He could not do this, could not reforge the broken chain,
without me,'' Dean Rusk writes.
   Reforging the chain, Richard Rusk interviewed family, critics
and friends as well as his father.
   ``At every stage of Dean Rusk's life _ youth, public servant,
retired statesman _ were signs of mortality,'' he writes. ``But
mainly I found affirmation of the goodness in my dad.''

<HEAD>Some Good News About Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As if to prove that things can't go down
forever, most of the news coming from the junk bond market lately
has been upbeat.
   The $200 billion market that paid a steep price for the debt
excesses of the 1980s has staged a significant rally in recent
months. By some measures, junk bonds have outperformed
investment-grade corporate bonds and Treasury bonds.
   The market really took off last week on news that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. would inject $1.7 billion into RJR Nabisco.
The news eased fears about RJR's ability to continue to meet debt
payments when the interest rate on $6 billion of bonds, a
bellwether for the market, are reset beginning next year.
   ``Fundamentally, things have stopped getting worse,'' says
Howard Marks, who manages about $1 billion in high yield funds at
Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles.
   To be sure, the market has a long way to go to regain anything
like its former vigor. It remains virtually shut to new issues _
volume has dwindled to just $382 million so far this year from more
than $12 billion in the same period last year.
   The drying up of new issues has clipped some wings on Wall
Street. Merrill Lynch last week reassigned the two co-heads of its
merchant banking department, Raymond Minella and Jeffrey Berenson.
   They led the firm's expansion into junk bonds, but their
department has little to underwrite these days and is stuck with
hundreds of millions of dollars in illiquid securities and
supposedly temporary bridge loans that can't be refinanced.
   Defaults, also expected to hit another record this year, were
underscored this past week when developer Donald Trump missed a
payment due to holders of junk bonds used to finance his Trump
Castle casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Those bonds slumped in value
afterward.
   Nonetheless, much of the bad news about defaults already has
been discounted.
   For example, prices on more than $800 million of junk bonds
issued by Southland Corp. rose sharply late last week even as the
company, which operates the 7-Eleven chain, missed an interest
payment.
   Bondholders hadn't expected Southland to make the payment, says
Kingman Penniman, an analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei. But
they were cheered by the company's enhanced offer to exchange the
bonds for cash and stock, he said. What's more, the bonds were
trading at less than a quarter of their face value. At that level
they have value even if Southland liquidates, he says.
   Bankers say new players such as equity investors and revived
demand from long-time junk buyers have given the market fresh
strength. In one sign of that strength, the market two weeks ago
readily absorbed the sale of $50 million in junk bonds from the
Resolution Trust Co., the federal agency liquidating the holdings
of failed savings and loans.
   ``Basically, the market is looking for paper,'' said John
Crotty, head of new issues and sales at First Boston Corp.
   Crotty says the junk market generates nearly $25 billion in
interest payments a year, and investors are reinvesting much of
that money. Those flows have helped junk bonds recover from the
depths reached late last year and early this year.
   Indeed, First Boston's index of 400 junk issues showed a total
return of 5.46 percent from March through May. Ten-year U.S.
Treasury bonds returned just 1.32 percent in that period, according
to the firm's index.
   Some institutions are hoping the market gets a further boost
from a new auction system set to start next month for junk bonds
and lightly traded equities.
   New York Securities Auction Corp. plans to conduct weekly
auctions of securities, primarily junk bonds, over Bloomberg
Financial System's electronic screen service.
   Joel Greenblatt, the Wall Street investor who is starting the
service, says the lack of ready price information on junk bonds
deters investors. He hopes to counter that by getting institutions
to display their offerings on a screen and allowing others to bid
for the bonds.
   ``One of the hallmarks of an efficient market is open
information on buyers and sellers,'' says Marks of Trust Company of
the West, which has enrolled as a member in the auction system. He
said the system ``may increase efficiency and it may increase
liquidity.''

<TEXT>
   It hasn't become a police matter, and so far
there seems to have been little impact on family and social
affairs, but there has been a mysterious disappearance of
middle-age men from the work force.
   Statistically speaking, they've left little trace, which amounts
to a truly astounding occurrence, since we're not talking about a
few guys vanishing here and there.
   A few disappearances are to be expected, considering the stress
factor these days, but this vanishing act involves 30,000 a month.
It's been going on since last October, and that means the total now
is well over 200,000.
   Those are significant numbers. Nothing like it has been seen
before, and making it more mysterious is the absence of clues.
These men haven't been laid off, for example, because they haven't
shown up in jobless insurance claims.
   They've just gone from the rolls, leaving statisticians with the
puzzle of figuring out where they went. If the disappearance
occurred in just one or two months, it might be dismissed as a
statistical aberration. But not this.
   Economists at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a securities firm,
have been among those seeking an explanation but, while they have
an interesting and plausible theory, they haven't yet been able to
prove it.
   Among their findings is that labor force participation by men
aged 45 years to 54 years peaked last October, with 91.8 percent of
them working, and that the percentage had fallen steadily to reacy
90.1 percent in May.
   Those unaccustomed to percentages such as these might find such
a decline of no special concern, even insignificant. It is anything
but, the economists say. It is extremely significant, unprecedented
in the entire economic expansion that began eight years ago.
   They checked the age group one tier below, in the 35 years to 44
years category. The phenomenon couldn't be seen among these younger
men. In fact, job participation in that group was decidedly stable
rather than unstable.
   Then they checked the age tier just above, where men aged 55
years to 64 years are counted. While they did find participation by
this group had declined quite a bit since the 1950s, that decline
leveled off in 1986.
   In short, since last October, when the middle-age men began
disappearing, there was no comparable phenomenon to be found among
their older or younger brethren.
   When so many of similar profile disappear, if only
statistically, it suggests something sinister. This becomes
especially so when they leave no clues. Had filed for unemployment
insurance, for instance, you might assume they had been laid off,
and then you might limit your probing to why.
   But they didn't file for insurance, or at least the statistics
suggest they did not. Initial claims for such insurance have moved
in a narrow range since last fall _ no sharp runup, no big bulges
at all.
   Sinister indeed! Two hundred thousand men in the prime of life
vanish from the labor force without a whimper. No complaints from
their wives and children. No obvious explanation in the statistics.
No inquiries.
   No, but there is a possible explanation, and it is anything but
sinister.
   They retired!
   That is the tentative conclusion of the economists, who explain:
   ``Having chosen early retirement or settlement packages, many of
these men may be ineligible to file for unemployment insurance.
Thus, their job disappears without any claim having been filed.''
   The puzzling statistics could indicate, they say, that early
retirement programs now are being directed at middle managers
rather than senior level managers.
   Lost from the job statistics perhaps, but not from life. They
may not labor, but they do live. In fact, if they really did settle
for a bundle of money to get lost they're probably living the good
life.

<TEXT>
   Approaching the midway point of 1990, Wall
Street analysts see many blessings to count in the performance of
the stock and bond markets so far this year.
   Stocks have reached record highs in recent weeks, and bond
prices have also rallied as interest rates declined.
   Worries about inflation have ebbed as well. But a slowdown in
the pace of economic growth doesn't appear, in the eyes of many
forecasters, to have brought business to the brink of any severe,
economy-wide recession.
   Along with whatever enthusiasm those developments may have
engendered, many market commentaries and predictions these days
express a generous measure of relief.
   Since New Year's, most observers agree, the markets have tiptoed
with remarkable agility through a minefield of potentially serious
hazards.
   Already fading into memory from the early weeks of the year are
a severe break in Japanese stock prices _ some of the losses from
which have recently been recouped _ and the failure of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the titan of the junk-bond market.
   More recently, investors have had to grapple with worries about
credit problems facing a diverse list of borrowers and lenders
ranging from developer Donald Trump to the money-market mutual
funds.
   Even the much-discussed threat of a ``credit crunch'' appears to
have been staved off, for the time being at least.
   Whatever happens during the summer and beyond, many analysts
say, the Federal Reserve has kept some ammunition in reserve to use
against any signs of developing economic trouble.
   So far, they note, the Fed has held off on any moves to a more
stimulative credit policy as growth has weakened.
   ``The economy is slowing, but a recession can probably be
avoided,'' said Jack Lavery at Merrill Lynch.
   ``We believe the data to be reported during the weeks ahead will
show economic activity to be weak enough and inflation tame enough
to spark another Fed easing within the next month.''
   Hopes of that sort helped inspire a solid advance in the stock
market during the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials climbed 73.51 points to 2,935.89, surpassing on Friday
its previous closing peak of 2,935.19 reached on June 4.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.81 to
197.86; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 6.68 to 467.55, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 2.84 at 364.03.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 155.29 million shares a day,
against 168.46 million the week before.
   As much as they may like the chances for lower interest rates
during the second half of the year, many analysts are leery of
committing themselves too much in that direction.
   They haven't forgotten the surprise that hit optimistic
forecasters over the early months of 1990, when interest rates
jumped along with borrowing costs in the financial centers of Japan
and West Germany.
   Suresh Bhirud, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., argues,
``interest rates are most likely to remain in a narrow range at
this point.''
   With a slowdown in the economy, he says, ``the budget deficit is
likely to increase. Therefore, although interest rates may not rise
substantially, we doubt they will come down much until there is a
meaningful reduction in the deficit.
   Also, he says, ``real interest rates are still high in Germany
and Japan, which will keep pressure on U.S. rates for some time.''

<HEAD>Greyhound Banning Smoking on Buses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc., taking a cue from the
airline industry, announced Friday it would ban smoking on its
buses beginning Monday.
   ``Signs are going up right now,'' company spokesman George
Gravley said. The ban takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday on
regularly scheduled buses. Charter service is not affected, the
company said.
   Greyhound's marketing vice president, Ralph Borland, said the
ban was a response to recent passenger surveys that indicated
riders preferred non-smoking service. He said Greyhound research
indicated 22 percent of its passengers smoke, compared to 29
percent of the general public.
   The company carried 22.5 million passengers last year and has
been carrying about 75 percent of that passenger load since a
strike by drivers began March 2.
   Gravley acknowledged that some passengers would be unhappy about
the ban. Most buses stop about every two hours for meals or
intermediate rest stops and ``we hope that will provide the relief
that the smokers need,'' he said.
   Eight states already ban smoking on buses: California, Idaho,
New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.

<HEAD>Kodak and IBM to Develop Integrated Publishing System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. and IBM Corp. said
Friday they will jointly develop publishing computer systems that
integrate editorial, advertising and business operations.
   IBM spokesman Jim Keller said the companies will work together
to develop a system that allows a newspaper or magazine to link the
different aspects of its operations.
   The systems will be targeted at large and mid-sized
publications, Keller said.
   The companies did not disclose financial details of the joint
venture, which involves Kodak's Electronic Pre-Press Systems Inc.
subsidiary and IBM's Media Industry marketing group. EPPS makes
units for Atex Publishing Systems. The systems will use IBM
hardware and Atex software, but will be designed to be compatible
with the existing computer systems used by publishers, said Kodak
spokesman John LaBella.
   He said publishers are increasingly looking for systems that
integrate different aspects of their businesses.
   The companies have had a working relationship for several years,
and will introduce a system that integrates pre-press operations at
the American Newspaper Publishers Association technical exposition
and conference beginning Saturday, LaBella said.

<HEAD>Big Board Takes Steps to Avoid Long-Term Obsolescence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manhattan's South Street Seaport was a frenetic
commercial center in the 19th century but fell victim to
technological leaps in moving goods that made its wharves and
merchants obsolete.
   The message has not been lost on another business landmark
nearby, the cavernous New York Stock Exchange.
   This past week the Big Board took steps ultimately designed to
avoid the same fate as the seaport, now a trendy singles spot of
bars and restaurants where oceangoing clippers are just quaint
relics from the pre-Civil War days.
   NYSE Chairman John Phelan confirmed plans to ease into
computerized after-hours trading, which could lead to full 24-hour
trading by the year 2000. The NYSE also released a study of stock
volatility, aimed at showing that the nation's biggest securities
market is sensitive to the anxieties of all investors.
   Although details of the after-hours trading plan must still be
worked out, the aim is to recover business lost to competing
exchanges and companies that are trading NYSE stocks on their own
when the NYSE is closed.
   ``There is some volume going overseas, and we'd like to capture
some of that volume back,'' Phelan said.
   The Big Board remains by far the preeminent U.S. place to buy
and sell stocks. But in recent years a growing number of investors
who want to do business in the off-hours are going to London or
Tokyo, a reflection of what appears to be an inexorable march
toward a nonstop global marketplace.
   Other investors have found it more efficient to execute trades
via technologically advanced NYSE rivals in the United States. The
over-the-counter NASDAQ system, for example, uses computers to
match buyers and sellers and is expanding into off-hours trading
this September, when it will open at 3:30 a.m. Eastern time.
   By contrast, the NYSE has clung to an old-fashioned group of
market-making ``specialists.'' Although they use computers to make
the flow of trading more efficient, the specialist system still
hinges on human-to-human contact on the Big Board floor, which
opens weekdays at 9:30 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m.
   The NYSE's traditional reluctance to expand hours has played a
partial role in its eroding share of business. It handled only 69.2
percent of all trades in listed stocks last year, a record low.
Exchange earnings fell to $6.29 million last year, a 40 percent
drop from the $10.45 million earned a year earlier.
   ``The NYSE is taking a look at after-hours trading basically
because of competitive pressures,'' said Joseph Hardiman, chairman
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs the
NASDAQ system. ``They're trying to be responsive by telling issuers
they will be able to provide something.''
   The NYSE's other signal of responsiveness to customers came
earlier in the week when its Market Volatility and Investor
Confidence Panel disclosed findings of a study into causes of
stock-price volatility.
   The most important recommendation was the use of trading halts
during times of market stress. But many securities professionals
remain opposed to such an idea, arguing it could worsen panicky
selling by investors trying to get out of a market before it closed.
   Some suggested trading halts also could have the ironic side
effect of driving business to less restrictive markets abroad.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More signals emerged suggesting a slowing economy. Retail and
wholesale prices rose modestly in May, easing pressure on
inflation, the government reported. It also said the trade deficit
shrank dramatically in April, reflecting lower demand for imported
oil and autos.
   _A takeover specialist ensnared in the Ivan Boesky insider
trading scandal received a 2-month prison term, one of the mildest
punishments meted out in a four-year-old crackdown on securities
fraud. Martin A. Siegel, who allegedly took suitcases of cash from
Boesky in return for insider tips, could have received 10 years in
prison but he cooperated with prosecutors to implicate others.
   _Standard &amp; Poors Corp., a leading debt-rating agency, lowered
its opinion of creditworthiness of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., reflecting growing weakness in the automotive industry. The
rating downgrade means Ford and Chrysler will find it more costly
to borrow money.
   _Casino developer Donald Trump missed a payment on junk bonds
used to finance one of his Atlantic City resorts, the most visible
signal yet of the trouble dogging his real estate empire. But
another prominent personality with the initials D.T. basked in more
positive publicity, luring hordes of moviegoers as the Hollywood
blockbuster Dick Tracy opened around the country.

<HEAD>Honda Dealers to Handle Jeeps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. will sell Chrysler Corp.
Jeeps through some of its dealers in Japan beginning this fall, the
companies said Friday.
   In a joint announcement, Honda and Chrysler said 1991-model Jeep
Wranglers and Cherokee sport-utility vehicles will be sold in about
750 of Honda's Primo dealerships. The companies said they expect
about 2,000 Jeeps would be sold in the next model year.
   That would more than double Chrysler's sales in Japan, and marks
the first time a U.S. company has used Honda's Japanese dealers to
sell vehicles.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca for years has complained about
being shut out of the Japanese market either because of
governmental regulations or dealer resistance.
   Last year, Chrysler sold about 1,500 Jeeps and cars through
Chrysler Japan Sales Ltd., a joint venture between the U.S. company
and J. Osawa &amp; Co. of Japan.
   Japanese dealers rarely handle more than one car make at a
dealership. ``There is an incredible amount of dealer loyalty to
their companies (in Japan),'' auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch
Investors Services Inc. said Friday.
   She called the Honda-Chrysler deal ``a nice little breakthrough
for Chrysler.''
   Under the agreement, about half of Honda's Primo dealer network,
a collection of 1,755 businesses that market family oriented cars,
will distribute Cherokee and Wrangler vehicles.
   Honda said in a statement released in Japan that the Cherokee
would sell for about $33,300 and the Wrangler for about $23,800.
Base prices for 1990 versions of the vehicles are $15,545 for the
Cherokee and $11,599 for the Wrangler.
   Honda sells its own sporty cars through its Verno dealerships
and luxury cars through its Clio dealerships. In all, Honda has
about 2,500 dealerships in Japan.
   General Motors Corp., the No. 1 automaker in the U.S., sells
vehicles in Japan through Suzuki Motor Co. dealers.
   Ford Motor Co., the nation's second largest automaker, uses a
290-dealership Autorama network to sell Ford and Mazda vehicles
under Ford nameplates in Japan. Ford expects to sell about 100,000
cars and light trucks through Autorama, including a mini
sport-utility vehicle, this year.

<TEXT>
   Financially strapped Philadelphia received
another blow Friday when Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its
ratings on $1.3 billion in city bonds, citing ``chronic deficit
operations.''
   City Financial Director Betsy Reveal, who called the news
``disappointing but not unexpected,'' said the decision could cost
the city $30 million in future years in extra interest.
   The city's general obligation bonds were downgraded two rating
notches, from BBB&plus; to BBB-. The company also said $23.6 million in
bonds issued by the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority and
Philadelphia Parking Authority were downgraded to BBB-.
   The rating is one level above what Standard &amp; Poor's considers
the minimum ``investment grade'' that offers a high level of
security. The last time the city's bond rating dipped below
investment grade was in 1976.
   ``It clearly will increase our costs for future borrowing,''
Reveal said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's pointed to this fiscal year's city deficit _
estimated to be $60 million when the year ends June 30 _ as a sign
of ``chronic fiscal imbalance.''
   The credit-rating company added that the city's $2.1 billion
budget scheduled to go into affect July 1 ``does not bode well for
restoration of fiscal stability.''
