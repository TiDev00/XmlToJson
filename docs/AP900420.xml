   Milton and Emmie Douglas had seen photographs
of children who needed parents. They wanted a closer look, and got
it at a special shopping mall fashion show.
   A 9-year-old boy who had been left on a doorstep as an infant
won their hearts by walking offstage and asking, ``Y'all gonna be
my mother and father?'' ``He just picked us out of the crowd,''
said Douglas. ``We don't know what drew him to us. ... but we're
glad it happened that way.''
   ``What made me think they were my parents was the way they
looked at me,'' said Larry, now 11 and the Douglases' adopted son.
``Like, `This is a nice kid. Why couldn't he be our child?'''
   Using spring fashion shows as a way to find families for
hard-to-place children may be unique to Louisiana.
   J.C. Penney's puts on the shows and for the past eight years has
invited the state Department of Social Services to bring children
who have been ruled free for adoption but don't have a family
waiting for them.
   Penney's supplies clothes for the children to model, and a
social worker tells shoppers about the need for foster and adoptive
parents and says a sentence or two about each child.
   ``I'm not familiar with anybody else that does fashion shows.
That doesn't mean it's not being done,'' said Mary Beth Seader,
vice president of the National Committee For Adoption.
   Some viewers, like Gloria Mitchell, were offended.
   ``We're going back in time. This is like slavery,'' said
Mitchell, who went to a show March 17 to see if an advertisement
she'd read was real. ``We're auctioning off these kids.''
   But state social workers say it finds families. And officials
with other adoption agencies say that as long as the children
understand there's no guarantee they'll find parents and are
treated with sensitivity, it sounds like a reasonable technique.
   ``I would love to not have to have to do this. I would love it
if we had more families than children. But that's not the
reality,'' said Kerry Ermon, one of two family recruitment workers
for the Social Services agency. ``Let me tell you, it is a very
effective recruitment campaign.''
   In the month after this year's shows, about 80 people called to
ask about fostering or adoption as a direct result of seeing the
shows or news reports about them, according to Ermon.
   Larry was one of hundreds of thousands of children around the
country who were in state custody because they were orphaned,
abandoned, abused or neglected, because their parents couldn't
control them, or for some other reason.
   Most eventually are returned to their parents or raised by
relatives, but more than 15 percent eventually are released for
adoption, according to the National Committee For Adoption, a
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group.
   In 1985, the last year for which figures are available, an
estimated 276,000 children nationwide were in what bureaucrats call
substitute care, according to the organization.
   Of about 5,000 children in Louisiana's custody, 800 are eligible
for adoption. Half will be adopted by their foster parents, but
caseworkers are still trying to find homes for 416, said Bobby Ann
Clark of the Department of Social Services.
   When Larry sauntered across the stage at a suburban mall, he had
been in foster care for two years.
   Mrs. Douglas said he had been left as an infant on the doorstep
of a couple who raised him for seven years. But after the woman
died, state welfare workers decided the man was too old to take
care of the boy, she said.
   Larry knew the fashion show didn't guarantee him parents. He was
optimistic when he walked onto the stage, but became nervous when
couples walked up afterward.
   ``I thought they were going to pick either Nina or Jerry, but
they came and picked me,'' he said. ``I thought, `WOWWWWWW! I'll
finally be adopted!' I was happy.''
   Representatives of state and local adoption groups said their
main concerns about the fashion shows were that all applicants for
foster care or adoption be carefully screened, and that children be
prepared for the show and treated during it with understanding and
sensitivity.
   ``You don't want to expose the child to a situation where there
may be embarrassment and a big letdown. If the child is prepared in
a sensitive manner, I guess it could work very well,'' said Seader.

   Twenty years after the environmental movement was launched, 130
countries on Sunday will mark Earth Day with parades and protests
calling attention to garbage in Japan, rain forests in Brazil and
pollution everywhere.
   At the United Nations in New York, 42 astronauts from l4
countries will participate in celebrations to include displays of
earth photos taken from space 20 years ago and others taken
recently. The effects of pollution, oil drilling and tree felling
are clear.
   A transmission from the Soviet space station Mir will be
projected on a large screen.
   At the Washington D.C. zoo, elephants will trample aluminum cans
to promote recycling. In Eger, Hungary, there will be a parade of
people dressed as trees and birds, and in Keszthely people will
wear gas masks to protest auto emissions.
   British shoppers are being asked to return unnecessary and
wasteful packaging to grocery stores for recycling.
   In the Himalayas, climbers from the United States, Soviet Union
and China have set Earth Day as their target for reaching the
summit of Mount Everest. They will collect garbage from past
expeditions during the climb.
   Earth Day will last a week in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
Exhibitions, lectures and other activities are aimed at heightening
awareness of the dangers of polluting the Gulf with offshore oil
rigs and coastal industries.
   Gaylord Nelson, a former U.S. senator who founded the first
Earth Day in 1970, said this year's celebration is likely to be
``the largest grassroots demonstration in history.''
   Nelson, a counselor to the Wilderness Society, said it should
create public uproar that ``shakes the political leadership of the
world out of its lethargy and forces it to deal with global
environmental problems.''
   Japan will celebrate Earth Day for the first time. Events will
include a festival on Yumenoshima, or ``dream island,'' in Tokyo
Bay. The island was built on landfill, mainly garbage from Tokyo.
   Denis Hayes, international chairman of Earth Day, said on a
recent visit to Tokyo that Japan was ``in a league almost with the
United States in being viewed as an environmental outlaw, perhaps
even more so because of its dependence on resources from overseas.''
   Saving the Brazilian rain forests from development will be a
major theme worldwide.
   The Japan Tropical Forest Action Network plans a ``rock for the
rain forest'' concert to publicize Japan's position as the leading
importer of wood from tropical rain forests.
   In Budapest, Hungary, ecologists will give the Brazilian Embassy
a coffin filled with sawdust to protest the ``killing'' of the
Amazon forests.
   In Britain, Friends of the Earth will tell people that massive
Third World foreign debt contributes to destruction of rain
forests. The environmental group is pushing for debt relief.
   Other activities worldwide will include:
   _ France: formation of a human chain of 500,000 people along the
Loire River that will stretch about 520 miles.
   _ Hungary: in Vac, a dirty 4-yard sphere symbolizing the earth
will be rolled into the main square and washed clean.
   _ The Netherlands: environmental groups will protest highways
under construction and proposed tunnels to bisect the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam corridor. _ Ireland: parades in Dublin and 10
other cities are planned.
   _ Britain: the Council For Posterity launches the Adopt-A-Planet
competition in primary and secondary schools. Students will adopt a
small piece of land, making improvements and taking ``before'' and
``after'' photographs. Cash prizes will be awarded in June 1991.
   _ Mexico: environmentalists will march four miles from Zocalo to
Chapultepec Park. The theme will be the four elements: earth, wind,
water and fire. A major issue is poaching and export of sea turtle
eggs and skins.
   _ United States: in Arizona, students will plant hundreds of
trees. Many communities will close streets to motorized traffic.
Some chemical plants will hold open houses.
   But not everyone is enthusiastic: ``What Earth Day is going to
be is an anti-technology, anti-business, anti-Western civilization
orgy by people who have no serious concern about enviromental
objectives,'' said Fred Smith, president of the U.S. Competitive
Enterprise Institute.

<TEXT>
   Last year, Poles showered Soviet soldiers
with rocks and bottles 21 times during a 210-mile training march.
This year, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki opposes a speedy Red
Army withdrawal.
   They have disdained Soviet soldiers for decades, but Poles seem
to understand Mazowiecki's point.
   Poland has not joined Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the rush to
be free of the Red Army _ not because it loathes the ``occupiers''
less, but because it fears the army of a reunited Germany at least
as much.
   The Solidarity prime minister, leader of the first non-Communist
government to take office in the former Soviet bloc, envisions a
Soviet withdrawal only within an overall security arrangement for
Europe.
   A survey by television's Center for Public Opinion Research in
March indicated 47 percent of Poles felt the Red Army should go,
but the date should depend on events in Germany.
   ``Maybe a year ago, people would say the Soviet troops shouldn't
be here, that their presence was more like a political presence,''
said Franciszek Grzywacz, a magazine editor in the garrison town of
Legnica. ``Now people are saying it is a kind of a shield against
Germany.''
   Poland's predicament is as old as its geographical position
between Germany and Russia, and has led new voices to utter a
version of the old regime's argument.
   For decades, the Communists used the danger from Germany,
combined with the general threat from the West, to support Poland's
alliance with Moscow and the Red Army presence.
   Most estimates put the number of Soviet soldiers in Poland at
40,000 to 45,000, well below the 380,000 in East Germany, 80,000 in
Czechoslovakia and 65,000 in Hungary.
   Those in Poland, however, form the supply link from the Soviet
Union to the East German frontier of the Warsaw Pact.
   One of the most important Soviet military headquarters, the
Western Theater of Military Operations, is in Legnica, in
southwestern Poland, 55 miles from East Germany. The headquarters
would coordinate a Warsaw Pact offensive, using the Baltic fleet,
air force support and troops from across Eastern Europe.
   Legnica, 250 miles southeast of Warsaw, is one of the few places
in Poland where the Red Army is visible. The well-preserved painted
brick architecture is a reminder of the town's place in the swath
of Silesian territory taken from Germany after World War II.
   Most of its 100,000 people, however, are Poles uprooted from
eastern territories annexed by the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin.
   That adds emotion to the atmosphere as Soviet officers stroll
the streets and black Russian limousines rush commanders to and
from prewar mansions in a vast Red Army compound enclosed by by a
7-foot concrete wall.
   Tales of Soviet army abuses are legion: secret installations in
the forest, bombs gone astray, ditches running black with leaking
fuel from military airports, low-flying planes buzzing farms.
   Russian-bashing is a popular sport: Soviet soldiers live
rent-free and make slums of the scarce apartments denied to Poles,
cover windows with copies of Pravda instead of curtains, throw
garbage out the windows, favor strip shows, are above Polish law
when they commit crimes or cause traffic accidents.
   ``If the Soviets go home, people in this town will have nothing
to talk about,'' said Grzywacz, the magazine editor.
   Teacher Jolanta Tochinecka does not see the Red Army as a
safeguard. ``Poles know they can rely only on themselves,'' he
said. ``That was shown in 1939,'' when the German invasion of
Poland started World War II.
   Scrawled slogans may say ``Tanks to the Volga,'' and one roughly
translates to ``Soviets go back to your garbage,'' but the soldiers
are an economic benefit to Legnica.
   There is a brisk trade in Soviet gold and television sets
outside the elegant turn-of-the-century officers' center.
Shopkeepers rely on the well-paid soldiers and their families, who
relish the relatively comfortable five-year tours in Poland.
   Residents speak gratefully of access to sophisticated hospitals
and some other facilities _ the Soviets have their own schools,
police force, book stores and work crews _ but the communities are
largely separate.
   ``There are not two sides of town,'' Grzywacz said. ``There are
two cities.''
   Soviet troops came to Poland ``temporarily'' under a 1956
agreement that contains assurances of Polish sovereignty and
provisions that the Kremlin will pay for their upkeep.
   In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, negotiations already have turned
Soviet soldiers toward home. The Red Army has been in those
countries since it crushed Hungary's anti-Stalinist uprising of
1956 and the Czechoslovak ``Prague spring'' liberalization of 1968.
   It was Moscow that proposed talks on leaving Poland.
Mazowiecki's government announced in March that discussions would
begin on finances and the ``inconveniences'' suffered by
communities where Soviet soldiers are stationed.
   The Polish subsidy for the troops amounted to 26 billion zlotys
($2.7 million) in 1989, according to statistics compiled by Radio
Free Europe.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has demanded the Soviets withdraw
this year, but government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said
in mid-March:
   ``Poland is at work on the proposals to be presented during the
Vienna negotiations regarding the overall withdrawal of Soviet
troops in the context of a new European security system.''

<HEAD>Economic Plan Has Brazil's Wealthy Flocking to Psychiatrists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de
Mello's drastic economic plan has Brazilian psychiatrists working
overtime to give the nation's wealthy a shoulder to cry on.
   ``I've been working 14 hours a day since the plan was announced.
The rich feel a mixture of panic, astonishment, anger, and
depression, and they want to talk about it,'' said Flavio Gikovate,
director of the Institute of Psychotherapy.
   Collor decreed his plan Mar. 16, one day after taking office. It
set an 18-month freeze on savings accounts of more than $1,200. It
also limits withdrawals from money market funds to $600, or 20
percent of an account, whichever is greater.
   The measure froze about $115 billion _ 80 percent of all bank
deposits.
   Most of Brazil's poor majority were not directly hit, as few had
savings that were affected. And with record inflation drastically
reduced during the past month, many of the worse-off say their
salary is buying more.
   But the wealthy are hurting, financially and psychologically.
   According to the prominent newsweekly Veja, at least two deaths
have resulted directly from Collor's ``New Brazil Plan.''
   A Sao Paulo lawyer identified only as Walter Z. had his entire
life's savings frozen in a bank and was unable to pay debts. He
shot himself to death three weeks after the plan was decreed.
   And 39-year-old Altair Rodrigues, a married father of two who
had almost all proceeds frozen from the sale of his Sao Paulo home
and bar, died of a heart attack.
   While most wealthy Brazilians have adapted to their new
circumstances with less trauma, many are still reeling from the
blow.
   A joke making the rounds reveals the degree of anger many rich
Brazilians feel toward the president.
   As the story goes, a businessman was waiting in a long bank line
behind irate customers trying to sort out their financial affairs.
The businessman finally lost patience, screaming: ``That's it! I'm
going to kill Collor!'' An hour later he was back at the bank,
explaining to the manager, ``The line was longer at the
presidential palace.'''
   ``For the poor, money is simply a means of buying things. For
the rich, money means status. Many of my patients are depressed
because they can no longer afford the lifestyle they were
accustomed to and feel their social standing has fallen,'' Gikovate
said.
   ``Brazil's rich are very spoiled. The poor have always paid for
the country's difficulties and the wealthy are not used to
sacrificing,'' he added.
   Another Sao Paulo psychiatrist, Marcelo Burkhard Sobrinho, said
his work load has increased 40 percent since the plan was announced.
   ``I thought I'd lose clients as they'd be short on money, but
it's just the opposite. Those who can't pay now are begging me to
keep them on, with promises that they'll pay as soon as possible,''
he said.
   The psychiatrist joked that the content of his sessions had
changed so drastically, he was considering taking a class in
economics.
   ``Before the plan, it was the usual talk of sex, love, careers,
shyness, and insecurities. Now at least 70 percent of the time my
clients talk about the economic plan,'' he said.
   Rio analyst Jorge Alberto Costa e Silva said the middle-class
may have been harder hit than the rich.
   ``Twenty percent of $1,000 is nothing, while 20 percent of $1
million can go a long way toward easing the pain,'' he said,
referring to the limit on money market withdrawals.
   Costa e Silva, who in May assumes the presidency of the
Geneva-based World Association of Psychiatry, said the middle-class
was ``orphaned'' by Collor's measures.
   ``Bank savings gave many people the opportunity to dream, to
make plans for the future. That's been taken away and for many in
the middle-class, life now means only eating, working, and going to
bed,'' he said.
   The analyst said he knew of at least 10 suicide attempts that
were related to desperation caused by the plan, a number he called
``frighteningly high.''
   Wealthy Brazilians with AIDS are having an especially difficult
time dealing wih the bank freeze.
   The government allows those who became unemployed because of
their illness to make unlimited bank withdrawals. But that accounts
for few of the 9,555 confirmed AIDS victims in Brazil, which has
one of the the world's highest rates of the disease.
   ``AIDS is a terminal disease, and those who have it feel they
may die at any moment. Knowing their money is blocked for the next
18 months causes tremendous anguish,'' said Lahire Dutra de
Carvalho Neto, a therapist who counsels AIDS patients at a Rio
hospital.
   He said many of his clients are bitter as they are unable to
travel or make plans to enjoy the time they have left.
   ``AIDS patients feel that first they were robbed of their lives.
Now they say the government is robbing them of their money,''
Carvalho Neto said.

   Beau Rambo, a 1{-year-old cocker
spaniel, has a heritage that would make any genealogical
name-dropper take notice.
   His great-great-grandmother was none other than Checkers, the
dog immortalized by Richard Nixon.
   In his 1952 ``Checkers'' speech, the then vice presidential
candidate rebutted charges that he illegally accepted gifts from
wealthy supporters. He cited the dog, a supporter's gift to his
family, as one contribution he would keep. The family pet died in
1964 at age 12.
   The speech proved an overwhelming success, turning public
opinion in favor of the GOP ticket: Dwight Eisenhower, who was
running for president, and Nixon.
   Today, the lineage of the Nixon family pet carries on in Craig
Patterson's Beau Rambo, who lives in West Point.
   Patterson discovered Rambo's lineage when he called the dog's
Idaho breeder to obtain the pedigree.
   ``She said (Rambo) had some show dogs on his dad's side and she
rattled off something about Nixon's Checkers,'' he recalled.
   Nikki Deines, a breeder in Emmett, Idaho, confirmed the lineage
reads like this: Checkers Prize Package of Nixon fame begat Otis
the Twelfth, who begat Miss Mollie Value, who begat Nikki's Beau
Tamara, who begat Rambo.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is expected to name a female
career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country
prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro,
according to informed sources.
   The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the
appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to
Mozambique.
   They said the administration believed a female ambassador could
relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office
Wednesday.
   They also said the administration is eager to have more women in
key posts. Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America
gone to women.
   In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several
male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the
sources, who asked not to be identified.
   Ms. Wells, who was born in Estonia, has no prior experience in
Latin America. Her personnel record indicates she speaks Spanish.
   Wells' name was submitted to the White House by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for the Managua post, and approval is
considered ``99.9 percent certain,'' one source said.
   The United States and Nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each
other's capitals since July 1988.
   The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were
interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the
Nicaraguan embassy here.
   But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open
with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President
Daniel Ortega in elections this February.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and a large congressional delegation
are expected to represent Bush at her inaugural.
   The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in
assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling
Contra rebels. But the request has been stalled by Senate
Democrats, some of whom believe that Eastern Europe has a greater
claim on U.S. resources than Nicaragua.
   Wells' nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986
encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up
the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward
that country.
   The nomination finally was approved in September 1987.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a leader of the campaign to hold up
Wells' nomination, said he wanted to pressure the administration
into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to Mozambique's
Marxist government.
   Mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the
U.S. government's list of countries under Marxist rule.

   The government has decided to award at
least $16,400 to a man acquitted of the 1986 killing of Prime
Minister Olof Palme.
   Christer Pettersson had sought 2 million kronor, or about
$330,000, in compensation for the 10 months he spent in custody
after his arrest in December 1988.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's Cabinet on Thursday set the
minimum award at 100,000 kronor. The final sum will be negotiated
by the justice chancellor and Pettersson's lawyer.
   A district court last July convicted Pettersson, 43, of Palme's
killing and sentenced him to life in prison. An appeals court
overturned the decision in October, citing insufficient evidence.
   Palme was shot on Feb. 28, 1986, as he was walking home from a
movie with his wife, Lisbet. The lone gunman fled down a darkened
street.

<TEXT>
   A bomb thrown from a car damaged
the home of a journalist and another blast caused panic at a soccer
stadium, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported in either incident Thursday. No one
claimed responsibility for the explosions, and army Col. Hector
Fonseca Lopez said there were no arrests.
   Authorities said one bomb exploded in a vacant lot 200 yards
from a soccer stadium in Tegucigalpa and that hundreds of fans ran
from the grounds in panic.
   Fonseca Lopez said the other blast destroyed an automobile and
the front of the home of Gabriel Garcia Ardon in the northern city
of San Pedro Sula.
   Garcia Ardon, 53, has had a television news program in San Pedro
Sula for 20 years and is a congressman from the governing National
Party.
   That bombing was the third attack directed at a Honduran
journalist in six months.
   On Oct. 28, a bomb damaged the Tegucigalpa home and car of
Diogenes Cruz Garcia, the sports editor of the daily El Heraldo and
also a congressman.
   Two people shot and wounded Jose Elan Reyes, 25, a journalist
with the private Radio America chain, on Nov. 8 as he waited for a
taxi on a Tegucigalpa street.

   Andrew Young's campaign to become the nation's
second black elected governor has run into a pair of obstacles _
slow fund raising and claims by his chief Democratic primary foe
that he is soft on crime.
   The former Atlanta mayor, seeking to repeat in Georgia what L.
Douglas Wilder did last year in Virginia, has attempted to avoid
race as an issue.
   Recently, he said, voters at a campaign stop asked if he thought
the state was ready for a black governor.
   ``I said that (when) the University of Georgia was ready to be
No. 1 in football, they didn't care what color Herschel Walker was;
they just wanted to know could the `big dog' run,'' Young said.
``And I said I'm about as close as you're going to get to Herschel
Walker in politics.''
   Young's major opponent, Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, has attacked him
as soft on crime. Miller cites FBI statistics that showed Atlanta
was the nation's big-city crime capital during the last two years
of Young's eight-year tenure.
   Young left the mayor's office in January. He served in Congress
from 1973-77 and was President Carter's U.N. ambassador after that.
   Young and Miller, the state's No. 2 official for the past 16
years, are the front-runners in a contest that includes former Gov.
Lester Maddox and two state legislators.
   The primary is July 17, with a runoff Aug. 7 if no candidate
wins a majority. The Democratic nominee will face the winner of a
Republican primary contest, most likely state Rep. Johnny Isakson.
Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat, is completing his second term
and cannot seek re-election.
   Miller had raised $2.76 million through April 3, according to
disclosure reports, and his campaign is believed to be the
wealthiest.
   Young has not yet filed a disclosure report. He has said he is
struggling to raise money from local businesses and has raised only
about $1 million overall.
   Young said the crime statistics cited by Miller were skewed by a
change in the reporting of crime information and other factors.
   Miller, who has proposed Marine Corps-type boot camps for young
first offenders and other law-and-order measures, called the
response a dodge.
   ``This election is going to boil down to a choice between Andy
Young, who wants to run from the crime and drug problem, and Zell
Miller, who wants to run right at it,'' Miller declared.
   But Franklin O. Greer, Young's consultant, predicted Miller's
strategy would fail.
   ``Zell just wants to point fingers. People don't think that's a
fair attack,'' said Greer, who helped manage Wilder's successful
campaign in Virginia.
   Maxine Goldstein, vice chairwoman of the state Democratic Party,
said she has not heard crime discussed as an issue in the rural
middle part of Georgia.
   ``The whole focus of his crime control effort was Atlanta. For
people down here, I don't think that's as strong as it would be in
the metro area,'' she said.
   Added Rep. Larry Walker, Democratic leader of the state House of
Representatives: ``Race is not the issue it once was.''
   But Emory University political science professor Merle Black,
who studies Southern politics, said the fact that Georgia has a
larger black population than Virginia _ 27 percent to 17 percent _
will not necessarily work to Young's advantage.
   ``What we've found in the past is, as long as blacks remain a
minority, as the black share of the population goes up, you do have
an intensification of color consciousness on the part of whites,''
Black said.
   For example, he said, George Wallace's 1968 presidential
campaign did best in rural Southern areas with ``substantial black
populations, and Wallace was obviously not drawing votes from
blacks.''
   Young's platform stresses economic development for rural areas,
where he hopes to recruit white voters.

<HEAD>John Kelly: Turbulent Years in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Kelly, the U.S. official whom Lebanese
kidnappers want to deal with, spent two turbulent years as
ambassador to that country, during which he was shot at by
Christian gunmen and once was reprimanded for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   A possible deal to release an American held hostage in Lebanon
may have fallen apart this week over President Bush's refusal to
have Kelly get involved.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, a pro-Iranian
group believed to be holding three American educators hostage,
demanded that Kelly fly to Damascus to ``coordinate some final
steps'' in the release of a hostage.
   But Bush refused, saying, ``The United States does not knuckle
under to demands.''
   Kelly, 50, is a career Foreign Service officer who worked in
obscurity until President Reagan sent him to Lebanon as U.S.
ambassador in 1986.
   He quickly found himself involved in ``back channel''
discussions with the White House on secret negotiations for the
release of Americans held hostage.
   Kelly consulted with Robert McFarlane, the president's national
security adviser; John Poindexter, the successor to McFarlane;
Oliver L. North, a National Security Council aide; and Richard V.
Secord, a retired Air Force general who was in the arms business.
   McFarlane, Poindexter, North and Secord all have been convicted
of crimes arising from the U.S. sale of weapons to Iran and the
diversion of profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The discussions involving Kelly were so secret that even
Secretary of State George Shultz was kept in the dark about them.
And when Shultz found out, he was ``shocked'' that Kelly had
discussed the hostages and the use of arms sales as an
``inducement'' to win their release.
   Shultz summoned Kelly to Washington to reprimand him in person
for dealing behind the secretary's back. The State Department said
Kelly did not take part in ``unauthorized negotiations'' for the
release of the hostages.
   Kelly was described at the time as a ``by-the-book'' diplomat
who may have been under orders not to inform the State Department
of his activities.
   In 1988, Kelly's bulletproof limousine was hit by gunfire in a
brief shooting exchange between his bodyguards and a Christian
militia patrol in East Beirut. He was not hurt, but less than four
months later he left the country because of a heart ailment.

<HEAD>Carpenter's Gavels Hush Windy Legislators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's carpenter Bill Beaton's job to make sure
that when the speaker of the House of Representatives flies off the
handle, the handle won't fly off his gavel.
   Beaton and his three-man crew in the U.S. Capitol carpentry shop
produce about 50 hand-tooled gavels every year for the speaker's
use in admonishing the often rambunctious House to shut up and
proceed with business.
   It takes a sturdy gavel to silence a chamber full of legislators
whose back-slapping gossip and guffaws are stealing an orator's
thunder, but Beaton says his 14-inch gavels of American sugar maple
are equal to the task.
   ``They can last for years if you don't abuse them,'' Beaton
says. ``One handle cracked when the gavel was hit real hard years
ago, I'm told, but I guarantee you the head will never come off the
handle.''
   The gavels are banged on a sounding board that's even tougher.
Beaton fashions them from an expensive, imported wood called lignum
vitae, or ironwood. Once used to make self-lubricating bearings for
old ships, it's so hard and dense that it sinks in water.
   ``It's practically bulletproof, and it makes just the right
sound,'' Beaton says. ``Other woods are too soft and won't echo,
but when the speaker hits his gavel on this ironwood board, you can
hear it all over the chamber.''
   Even using a new, electrically powered lathe that shapes gavels
from a pattern, somewhat like the machines that make duplicate car
keys, the 45-year-old shop foreman spends up to two hours making a
single gavel.
   Starting with a block of raw wood, Beaton makes grooves, bevels
and flutes with an assortment of hand chisels and wood-burning
devices and applies several finishing coats of clear, acrylic
lacquer.
   Beaton follows a fixed design that he says has been traditional
for a century or more, though nobody knows for sure.
   ``When I came here nearly seven years ago, I was told this is
the way we've always made them, and I should make them just like
this,'' he says. ``I've never done it any other way.''
   The shiny, blond-hued gavels, which Beaton estimates are worth
$75 apiece, are kept in a drawer at the speaker's marble-topped
rostrum for the exclusive use of the speaker or the legislator he
appoints to preside over the House during floor action on
legislation.
   Although a Washington newspaper article published in 1923
claimed that ``some years ago it was not unusual for 100 gavels or
more to be smashed in one Congress,'' broken gavels are a rarity
today.
   Their replacement is necessary, instead, because the speakers
like to autograph their gavels and present them as gifts to
constituents, friends or to fellow legislators who have steered
major bills to final passage.
   Veteran House parliamentarians recall that some House speakers,
notably Sam Rayburn of Texas, have wielded their gavels with a
heavy hand, but none has banged one into smithereens in recent
memory.
   Former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, a big Irishman from Boston,
frequently tapped gently with his gavel's handle to persuade
lawmakers to quiet down.
   One of the loudest gavel-bangers was former Rep. Richard
Bolling, D-Mo., who presided over floor debate and voting on scores
of bills from the speaker's chair during his 34-year House career.
   Bolling, interviewed by telephone from his retirement home in
rural Maryland, remembered breaking two gavels in those years.
``Fortunately, nobody got hurt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jerusalem Resolution is `Dangerous Nonsense,' Dole Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading congressional Republicans are
squabbling over who has the stronger credentials as a supporter of
Israel.
   The dispute began on Thursday, after Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said a resolution recognizing Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel has damaged Middle East peace efforts.
   Dole cited the resolution as an example of hastily passed
``dangerous nonsense'' and accepted partial blame for its Senate
passage on March 22.
   Four House Republicans, led by GOP Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
called a news conference to denounce Dole's statements and imply
that he was out of step with Republican policy.
   The non-binding resolution stating that ``Jerusalem is and
should remain the capital of the State of Israel'' was approved
without debate two days after it was introduced. It is set for
House action next Tuesday.
   Dole's Senate floor speech was just the latest in a series of
actions this year that have worried Israel partisans. Dole first
called for a cut in U.S. aid to Israel as part of an
across-the-board trimming of foreign aid to free money for other
friendly countries.
   Later, he questioned the need for $400 million in U.S. housing
loan guarantees for Israel, and lashed out at the Israeli embassy
for lobbying against a resolution on Armenian genocide.
   The four House Republicans, in a letter to Dole, took exception
to his reported comments that the threat to Israel has lessened.
They said the United States cannot undermine its security by
cutting aid.
   ``We continue to firmly support, as do the vast majority of the
elected members of our party, the Republican platform that
recognizes the importance of our unwavering commitment to Israel,''
the lawmakers wrote.
   Besides Gingrich, the group included Reps. Duncan Hunter of
California, Vin Weber of Minnesota and Bill McCollum of Florida.
   The news conference brought an angry response from Dole, who
released a letter to Gingrich in which he said the lawmakers had
based their criticism on comments misquoted or taken out of context.
   ``Unfortunately, some people seem to think that if you disagree
with a single policy or practice of the Israeli government, or
criticize anyone who lobbies on behalf of Israel, you should be
characterized as `anti-Israel,''' Dole wrote.
   ``That is bunk, and I am surprised that you have joined in the
narrow but shrill chorus of people who take that tack.''
   In a postscript, Dole added that Gingrich seemed to have
forgotten his ``private words of praise'' for Dole's proposal to
cut Israel aid by 5 percent. ``Or weren't those words for public
consumption?'' he wrote.
   In his criticism of the Jerusalem resolution, Dole said many of
the measure's sponsors had not even read it. He conceded that he
had made a mistake by joining 84 colleagues in sposoring the
measure and by failing to realize its repercussions in the Middle
East.
   During a trip last week to the Middle East, Dole said, leaders
of four Arab countries _ Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq _ all
brought up the Jerusalem resolution during discussions which had
been meant to explore prospects for pushing the peace process
forward.
   The leaders feared the document was a signal that the United
States might be headed toward granting legitimacy to Israel's
occupation not only of East Jerusalem, but also of other lands
occupied as a result of the 1967 Middle East war, Dole said.
   The resolution dabbles in a subject that ``our government and
many outside observers see as better left to negotiations among the
parties involved, rather than decided by unilateral action,'' Dole
said.
   Jerusalem is revered by Moslems, Christians and Jews as a holy
city, and each can point to history to buttress claims of
sovereignty. The eastern half of the city was seized from Jordanian
control by Israel in the 1967 war.
   ``The real point is not whether I believe, or even whether 100
senators believe, that Jerusalem should or should not be the
capital of Israel,'' Dole said.
   ``The issue is whether the Senate should be jumping into the
middle of an extremely sensitive situation without looking, or even
thinking first.''

   Cocaine's spread has kept the nation from meeting
some of its goals for fighting drug abuse, according to a new
report from federal health researchers.
   Goals set in 1980 for curbing drunken driving deaths, alcohol
consumption and cirrhosis of the liver by the end of 1990 have been
met, the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   But goals set for teen-age and young adult abstinence from drugs
and booze have been met only in part, amid a noticeable increase in
cocaine use, the CDC said.
   ``The percentage of persons using cocaine at least once a week
has increased from 5.3 percent in 1985 to 10.5 percent in 1988,''
the Atlanta-based CDC reported.
   ``Since 1980, substantial progress has been made toward
increasing public knowledge and awareness of the adverse social and
health consequences associated with the misuse of alcohol and
drugs. Risk perception has generally increased.''
   But, the agency said the increased use of cocaine among
adolescents is ``of particular concern.''
   The report noted previously published studies which say people
who are younger when they first try drugs or alcohol have more
substance abuse problems as adults.
   The goals for the end of 1990 were outlined in a 1980 report
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   Of eight major goals for curbing drug and alcohol abuse, the CDC
said, three have been met, one is likely to be met and four have
been met only in part.
   Already achieved:
   _ Fatalities from all alcohol-related car crashes should be less
than 9.5 per 100,000 population per year. That level was reached in
1988, after years of decline.
   _ Cirrhosis deaths should be less than 12 per 100,000 per year.
The rate fell from 13.5 in 1978 to less than 10 by 1986.
   _ Per capita consumption of alcohol should not exceed the 1978
level of 2.7 gallons. By 1987, it stood at less than 2.6 gallons,
the lowest level since 1958.
   Probable:
   _ More than nine in 10 women should be aware of the risks of
pregnancy and drinking, specifically fetal alcohol syndrome. Such
awareness, measured at 73 percent in a 1979 poll, had risen to 88
percent by 1985.
   Achieved only in part:
   _ Adolescents ages 12 to 17 abstaining from booze or drugs
should exceed 1977 levels. Alcohol abstinence rose from 69 percent
in 1977 to 75 percent in 1988, and marijuana abstinence rose from
83 percent to 94 percent. But cocaine abstinence fell 0.3 percent,
from 99.2 percent of adolescents to 98.9 percent.
   _ Young adults ages 18 to 25 reporting frequent drug use _ five
days a month _ should not exceed 1977 levels. Frequent use of
marijuana in this group declined from 19 percent in 1977 to 7
percent in 1988, but frequent use of other drugs rose from less
than 1 percent to 1.3 percent, ``primarily due to the increase in
the use of cocaine.''
   _ Adolescents ages 12 to 17 reporting frequent drug use _ five
days a month _ should not exceed 1977 levels. Frequent marijuana
use fell from 9 percent to 2 percent, but frequent use of other
drugs, including cocaine, went from ``less than 1 percent'' to 0.8
percent.
   _ Eight in 10 high school seniors should perceive ``great risk''
with ``frequent, regular'' smoking, marijuana use, intoxication or
barbiturate use. In 1988, 89 percent surveyed found great risk in
regular cocaine use, but only 68 percent for smoking, 77 percent
for smoking marijuana, 43 percent for intoxication, and 70 percent
for barbiturate use.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes Aid to Farmers Cutting Chemical Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers trying to reduce use of chemicals
would get millions of dollars in help from the federal government
under legislation approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   The research section of the panel's 1990 farm bill, approved
Thursday, includes $40 million annually during the five-year life
of the measure for a new low-input, sustainable agriculture program.
   Sometimes called organic farming, the method employs natural
methods for controlling pests and promotes crop rotation to sustain
the soil.
   Traditionally, the government has promoted farming methods that
encourage use of chemicals. This year, for example, it is spending
only $4.5 million on sustainable agriculture.
   ``Farmers across the nation want to reduce chemical use and they
want help from Washington to do it,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture Committee. ``It's time we
offered some real help, not just idle words.''
   The bill would also authorize $10 million each year for training
the nation's 5,500 extension agents in non-chemical farming methods.
   Other provisions of the bill include:
   _Establishment of a groundwater office in the Agriculture
Department to determine the extent of damage done by agricultural
chemicals to drinking water supplies and what to do about it.
   _A USDA study of the effects of climate change on food crops and
forests.
   _$400 million over five years for research grants to companies,
institutions and individuals studying plants, animals, nutrition
and health, natural resources and the environment, new products and
marketing and trade.
   _Creation of partnerships among researchers, state and local
governments, private businesses and the federal government for
developing and selling industrial products made from farm and
forest crops.
   _New funds for laboratory and on-site research, education and
training.
   _A 50-50 state-federal matching grant program to encourage
research.
   The Senate and House Agriculture committees have been working
since January on the 1990 farm bill, which will set policy for
virtually all federal agriculture programs during the next five
years.
   The panels are in different stages of completion on the various
parts of the legislation, which they hope to have before the full
Congress by summer.

   In the odd world of diplomacy, it's sometimes
easier to lecture friends. So Israel is taking the heat right now
while the Bush administration steps gingerly around the Soviet
Union and the Islamic Jihad.
   The Soviets are putting the squeeze on Lithuania in a carefully
calibrated scheme to choke off independence for the Baltic Republic.
   President Bush has threatened several times to retaliate if the
Soviets cross a line that he has not delineated for the American
public but said Thursday the Kremlin had no trouble perceiving.
   According to Lithuanian leaders, the Soviets have cut off
supplies of oil and reduced the flow of natural gas.
   But Bush is holding his fire.
   The Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, is holding at least three
Americans as hostages. On Thursday, the militants withdrew a
promise to release one of them after the administration turned down
a demand that Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly be sent to
Damascus, Syria, to conclude the details of the release.
   Again, Bush, at a joint news conference with President Francois
Mitterrand of France in Key Largo, Fla., kept cool.
   He reminded Iran, which many analysts think has considerable
control over the Islamic Jihad, that ``goodwill begets goodwill.''
Otherwise, the president said simply that Kelly could not go to the
Syrian capital because ``the United States does not knuckle under
to demands.''
   By comparison with the squeeze on Lithuania and holding innocent
Americans as hostages, the actions by Israel that drew U.S. wrath
are tame.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in charge of the caretaker
government, is going ahead with settling more Jews on the West Bank
and in Gaza despite U.S. warnings that such settlements are an
obstacle to peace with the Arabs.
   And Shamir reiterated in Jerusalem that he could not accept the
formula proposed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for
negotiations with Palestinians in Cairo.
   That was not news to Baker. After months of patient dickering,
Shamir last month did not submit the U.S. plan to the Israeli
cabinet for approval. The hard-line prime minister objected to
including in the talks Palestinians expelled from the West Bank or
others who were residents of Jerusalem.
   Through Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman,
Baker on Thursday came down hard on Shamir without referring to him
by name.
   ``It's our view that progress at this point depends on the
emergence of a government that is capable of making decisions and
willing to move forward on peace,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The statement was issued while Israel was trying to form a new
government to replace the ruling coalition, headed by Shamir, that
fell apart over the Baker plan.
   It prompted Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud to
remark, ``The process of forming a new government is currently
under way in Israel. It is therefore to be expected that another
country, be it as friendly as it may be, will not interfere.''
   Criticizing Israel is virtually risk-free for the Bush
administration. Everyone understands that the United States is
Israel's best friend and trusted ally.
   But cracking down on the Soviet Union or on the Islamic Jihad is
anything but risk-free.
   Bush and Baker do not want to jeopardize the political reform
the Kremlin has ignited in Eastern Europe or the withdrawal of tens
of thousands of Soviet troops and tanks.
   The two are aware that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
in a tough position, trying to prevent the disintegration of his
country. They want Gorbachev to negotiate terms for Lithuanian
independence. But they don't think backing him into a corner with
U.S. pressure would help.
   The Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, is holding Americans captive.
Eight Americans in all are hostages in Lebanon.
   The administration is following a delicate course. It does not
want to deal with terrorists, or even appear to be cutting deals
with them. But U.S. officials also are aware of the hostages'
precarious plight.
   So the president and the secretary of state are not hurling
threats at the Islamic Jihad or at Iran. And they are measuring
their words to Moscow, although Bush said Thursday ``there are
limits'' to his patience.

<HEAD>Food With a Conscience Served at Upscale Restaurant</HEAD>

   Forget granola, bean sprouts and smoothies. A new
restaurant called Evan's aims to sell health food as haute cuisine
without giving up its mission to serve ``food with a conscience.''
   Customers dine in candlelight on starched white tablecloths, but
make their guilt-free orders from menus printed on recycled paper.
   All cleaners used in the restaurant are biodegradable _ aerosols
are banned _ and ``Do it for the trees'' signs remind employees to
separate trash for recycling.
   The atmosphere is decidedly upscale, with valet parking,
original works of art and fresh flowers on the tables. And the food
is fancier than most people expect from health food, says owner
Evan Daily, who opened the restaurant this week in Houston's trendy
Montrose neighborhood.
   ``A lot of people think that if it's healthy, they're not going
to like it. Unfortunately, there's a certain stigma that's attached
to it,'' Daily said.
   Flower petals and herbs adorn the entrees, made from organically
grown foods whenever possible.
   The menu includes fresh vegetables, free-range chicken and beef,
venison raised on a New Zealand farm, fish and even some desserts
billed as healthy.
   Daily and chef Kathy Ruiz cook with infusions _ the essences of
various foods such as red peppers, carrots and roses that are
distilled in oil. The results include wok-charred tuna with mango,
tomato and scallions; shrimp on lime jalapeno pasta; and salmon
with a citrus vinaigrette. The house salad consists of mixed
greens, herbs and flowers.
   ``This is the restaurant we've been waiting for,'' said Brian
Long, an automobile executive who had dinner with his wife, Martha
Butler, a dancer with the Houston Ballet Company.
   The couple went to the restaurant after a fellow dancer who had
lunched there urged Ms. Butler to try it.
   ``It's good and it's good for you _ that's rare,'' Ms. Butler
said.
   Opening night drew an unanticipated 175 people to Evan's.
   Daily said he hopes the eatery will become a mainstay for people
who want to put Earth first, even when they're dining out.
   But he admits that's not an easy task in a city where barbecue
and chicken-fried steak are considered culinary treasures.
   ``In Houston, people are meat and potato eaters. They want their
red meat, their Jack Daniels and cigars,'' he said. ``We want to
replace those cravings with suitable substitutes.''
   Daily said he sacrificed some of his values to get more people
in the door.
   When he first envisioned Evan's, he wanted it to be free of
meat, alcohol and smoking. But there is a full bar and smoking is
allowed in the restaurant, which seats up to 200.
   At 28, Daily long has been committed to environmental issues.
His interest in cooking stems from his mother, who owns a cooking
school in Houston.
   ``We're not a couple of leftover hippies who decided to get
together to just do something fun,'' Daily said of himself and Ms.
Ruiz.
   While he attempts to alter some eating habits, Daily also tries
to set an example as an environmentally conscious business.
   Evan's uses recycled paper for business cards, stationery and
toilet paper. Employees get a recycling manual and they sign an
agreement saying they will do their best to separate wastes.

<HEAD>Most Industrial Toxic Pollutants Released Into Air</HEAD>

   More than half of the 4.6 billion pounds of
toxic chemicals released by industry go into the air, demonstrating
the need for tougher clean air legislation, federal officials say.
   The EPA reported Thursday that the amount of hazardous chemicals
released by the nation's factories in 1988 declined about 9
percent, but the agency said that might only be because of better
recordkeeping.
   In 1987, the first year under the reporting requirement, the
amount of toxic chemicals released by industry was put at slightly
more than 5 billion pounds with close to half going into the air.
   EPA officials cautioned that they are unable from the raw
figures, the latest available, to assess the health risks to
individuals. The figures do not take into account levels of
toxicity, release concentrations and actual exposure.
   Nevertheless, federal officials have been surprised at the high
volume of releases of toxic chemicals in 1987 and 1988. The
reporting requirement covers 332 toxic chemicals.
   ``The figures are absolutely shocking,'' declared Rep. Gerry
Sikorksi, D-Minn. ``This is almost 20 pounds (of hazardous
chemicals) per man, woman and child.''
   Sikorski and Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the volume of
pollution demonstrates the need for tougher air pollution control
laws. The Senate has approved a clean air bill that would require
industry to equip factories with the best available control
technology to cut releases of toxic chemicals. A similar bill is
before the House.
   ``We need a tough, new clean air bill and action on pollution
prevention,'' said Lautenberg.
   ``We've got to bring these pollution numbers down,'' agreed EPA
Administrator William Reilly, who said the pending clean air
legislation _ when enacted into law _ will significantly cut toxic
emissions from factories.
   The releases reported to the EPA by 19,762 industrial plants
nationwide are legal and within current federal or local
requirements, officials said. The reports are required annually
under a citizen right-to-know law that took effect two years ago.
   About 2.43 billion pounds of toxic chemicals were reported
released into the air by industry in 1988, compared with nearly 2.7
billion the year before. The rest was put into on-site landfills,
into lakes, rivers and streams, or injected far into the ground.
   Another 1.8 billion pounds _ not counted in the overall figure _
were sent away for treatment such as to municipal waste treatment
centers or private treatment and storage facilities, the EPA said.
   EPA spokesman Sean McElheny said the 1.8 billion pounds is
presumed not to have been released to the environment. The EPA,
however, has been critical of the handling of industrial wastes at
many municipal treatment facilities. Neither the municipal plants
nor private wastehandlers are subject to the toxic release
reporting requirement.
   Among the chemicals routinely emitted from industrial sources,
according to the 1988 data, were 77 carcinogens. The most widely
released cancer-causing chemical _ 115 million pounds _ was
dichloromethane, a chemical often used as an industrial solvent and
paint stripper.
   Industry released a total of 281 million pounds of carcinogens,
including chemicals such as arsenic, benzene and vinyl chloride.
   Chemical and allied industries accounted for about half of the
total releases. Two states with a concentration of petrochemical
plants _ Louisiana and Texas _ accounted for more than one-fourth
of the pollution totals.
   The EPA announcement provided only general release statistics as
provided by 19,762 industrial facilities and no information on
specific plants.
   But information released by Sikorski from data contained on EPA
computer tapes showed that Amax Magnesium Co. of Rowley, Utah, had
by far the highest volume of releases into the air _ nearly 110
million pounds.
   Amax was followed among the top five industrial air polluters in
1988 by Tennessee Eastman Co., Kingsport, Tenn., 40 million pounds;
Avtex Fibers in Front Royal, Va., 34 million pounds; Triad
Chemical, Donaldsonville, La., 27 million pounds, and Eastman Kodak
Co., Rochester, N.Y., 21.6 million pounds.
   The Avtex Fibers plant in Virginia closed in November after a
lengthy battle with the state over pollution issues.
   The states with the largest volume of toxic chemical releases
overall were Louisiana, 716 million pounds; Texas, 596 million
pounds; Ohio, 229 million pounds; Florida, 226 million pounds;
Indiana, 213 million pounds, and Tennessee, 203 million pounds,
according to the EPA.

<HEAD>Researchers Say AIDS Virus Protein May Kill Brain Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of every three AIDS patients suffer a
mental decline that may be caused by an AIDS virus protein that
forces brain cells to absorb a lethal dose of calcium, Harvard
University researchers said in a study published today.
   The study suggests that a calcium-blocking drug already in wide
use may be able to protect the brain cells and prevent patients
from developing what is known as the AIDS dementia complex.
   Dr. Stuart A. Lipton, a researcher at Harvard and the Children's
Hospital in Boston, said more studies must be conducted, however,
before the calcium-blocking drug could be safely used for AIDS
patients.
   In the study appearing today in the journal Science, Lipton and
three co-authors said a laboratory experiment proved that minute
amounts of an AIDS virus protein _ gp120 _ can cause nerve cells to
die by forcing the cells to absorb up to 33 times their normal
amount of calcium.
   An additional experiment, Lipton said Thursday, showed that the
calcium blocking drug nimodipine could protect nerve cells from the
effects of gp120.
   Nimodipine ``not only blocks the rise of calcium, but also
prevents cell death,'' Lipton said in a telephone interview.
   The experiment was performed in laboratory dishes using rodent
nerve cells. Experiments using human nerve cells are planned, he
said.
   Lipton cautioned that although nimodipine worked to protect the
nerve cells in the laboratory, there is no proof that it would work
on human cells or in human patients.
   ``Nimodipine would not treat the underlying infection but there
is hope, and it's just hope, that it might prevent the neurological
manifestations,'' he said. ``It's not a sure bet to work in these
patients.''
   Lipton said before nimodipine is used by AIDS patients,
researchers need to make sure it would not affect the action of
anti-viral drugs used to fight the AIDS infection.
   Many studies have shown that AIDS dementia complex develops as
the immune deficiency disease progresses. The dementia effect can
cause patients to lose the ability to walk, reason or function
normally.
   The cause of the brain problem has remained a mystery because
researchers have not been able to isolate the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, from the brain tissue of
affected patients.
   The Harvard study suggests that the dementia is caused by a
reaction to the gp120 protein and not by a direct viral infection
of brain cells.
   Douglas Brenneman, a researcher at the government's National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said his lab
conducted experiments similar to the Harvard studies and also found
that gp120 could kill some types of brain cells.
   ``I'm very pleased to see it (the Harvard study) because it
confirms our finding,'' he said. ``A vanishingly small amount of
gp120 is lethal to the nerve cells.''
   Brenneman said the Harvard use of nimodipine to protect the
cells ``is intriguing'' but that more study would be needed before
the drug could be used on AIDS patients.
   Lipton said his group used two types of gp120, a highly purified
form and a specimen removed from the blood of AIDS patients. The
Harvard experiment showed that both types of gp120 would kill the
nerve cells.
   The protein gp120 coats the surface of the HIV virus that causes
AIDS. Lipton said the virus can shed this protein, ``like you would
take off a coat,'' and the protein has been found in brain tissue
from AIDS patients.
   Both Lipton and Brenneman said they don't understand precisely
how gp120 forces nerve cells to absorb lethal levels of calcium.
   Lipton's co-authors in the study were Evan B. Dreyer, Peter K.
Kaiser and Jeffrey T. Offermann, all with Harvard Medical School
and related institutions.

   Former White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan
paid tribute to woman who choose not to work at a ceremony that
honored her and eight others as outstanding mothers of 1990.
   Noonan, author of ``What I Learned at the Revolution,'' a book
about her speechwriting career for Presidents Reagan and Bush, said
she wanted ``to say a small hurrah'' for ``mothers who don't get
the satisfactions of working in the world, suffering at the
cocktail party when they're asked what they do.''
   Other winners of the National Mother's Day Committee's awards
included: Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife; Judith
Peabody, an AIDS activist and board member of Gay Men's Health
Crisis Inc.; Brandeis University President Evelyn Handler; singer
Melissa Manchester; Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and
Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss.
   Mrs. Quayle cuddled the 8-month-old daughter of honoree Donna
Hanover, a TV anchorwoman and wife of former New York federal
prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, while cameras flashed at a news
conference.
   The Mother's Day committee is a non-profit group that has been
giving out the awards since 1979.
   Award recipient Elizabeth Glaser, a founder of the Pediatric
AIDS Foundation, said she had to devote herself to ``any mother's
most basic instinct, to save the life of her child.''
   Glaser contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion.
Her daughter has died of the disease and her son has tested
positive.
   ``To meet my goals as a mother, I must be a part of educating a
country about a disease that oftentimes (people) don't care
about,'' Glaser said.

   They were considered six of the best Apache
helicopters in the Army fleet, but during the U.S. invasion of
Panama, electronic parts in the all-weather aircraft failed to work
when wet.
   Congressional investigators described for Congress on Thursday
an array of problems that have plagued the attack helicopter in
both Army operations and the incursion into Panama last December.
   Citing those flaws, the General Accounting Office said the Army
should not buy the last 132 Apache helicopters as planned and use
the $1.49 billion already appropriated to repair the aircraft in
the fleet.
   ``Why buy more headaches?'' Richard Davis, director of the GAO's
Army Issues Group, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.
``Use the money to operate and fix existing Apaches.''
   Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone said the service did not
dispute the GAO findings but is making progress in rectifying the
problems.
   The Apache is ``the finest attack helicopter in the world, an
aircraft that has given the United States a capability that is the
envy of the world,'' said Stone, formerly the Army's top
acquisition executive.
   The GAO reported that during the Panama invasion, hydraulic
failure grounded one aircraft, a failed fuel cell stopped another
and a target detection system forced yet another to return to the
base.
   Complicating matters were the helicopters' sensitive electronic
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused a
buildup of moisture. Troops were forced to dry the parts in kitchen
ovens, the GAO said.
   ``The Betty Crocker approach to Apache maintenance,'' quipped
Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., a member of the subcommittee on
oversight and investigations.
   The Army plans to buy 807 Apaches from McDonnell Douglas Corp.
at a cost of $12 billion. Of that total, the service had received
534 Apaches from its first delivery in 1986 through last December.
   Investigators said the helicopter could perform all assigned
missions an average of 49 percent of the time, a low rate for an
Army helicopter.
   In addition, the GAO found that as the Apache flight hours
increased, its ability to perform decreased.
   ``Reliability and maintainability have been a nightmare,'' said
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the investigations
subcommittee.
   Members of the panel also questioned the Army's warranty with
McDonnell Douglas.
   The GAO said the warranty is similar to a health insurance
policy in which those requesting payments must meet a deductible
before being paid.
   The Army has found 166 problems with the Apache and taken steps
to solve 90, but none of the costs associated with fixing the
problems has been passed on to McDonnell Douglas under the
warranty, the GAO said.
   ``Not all failures count against the warranty,'' Davis said.
``Only those that come up to the depot for repair.''
   Questioned about the threshold, Davis said it would take about
2,000 to 3,000 failures before the Army would be reimbursed for the
cost of repairing the Apache.
   ``That's a ripoff for taxpayers,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

<HEAD>Farm Income Closely Linked to Government Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp drop in government payments in recent
years continues to bear heavily on farm income prospects.
   For example, according to Agriculture Department economists, in
1986 the net cash income of farmers rose 11 percent to a record
then of $51.8 billion from $46.7 billion in 1985, the first time
over the $50 billion mark.
   Meanwhile, direct federal payments to farmers soared 53 percent
to $11.8 percent in 1986 from $7.7 billion the year before.
   ``Net cash income focuses on the value of commodities sold in a
calendar year plus government payments, less all costs,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said in the April issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   In 1987, net cash income continued its record-setting pace,
rising to $54.5 billion, a 5 percent increase. Direct payments rose
42 percent to a record $16.7 billion.
   But drought ravaged crops in 1988 and forced market prices to
shoot up. Although disaster payments soared, the overall effect was
to cool off total federal payments to farmers.
   As market prices rose, that lessened the need for paying out so
much as ``deficiency'' payments to help bridge the gap between
market levels and target prices used to compute the subsidies.
   Nationally, according to USDA figures, net cash income in 1988
climbed to a record of $57.2 billion, while direct government
payments edged down to $14.5 billion.
   One characteristic of the bulge in 1988 net cash income was that
many farmers _ even some who lost crops to drought _ were able to
sell commodities stored from previous harvests at the higher market
prices. That counted as cash income in the calendar year.
   In 1989, with most commodity market prices still much higher
than they had been before the drought _ and the consequent
tightening of U.S. inventories _ farmers put more land back into
crops, thereby incurring larger expenses.
   The upshot was a dip in net cash income in 1989 to around $53
billion, according to current USDA estimates. It was still much
higher than at any time prior to 1986. Federal payments dropped to
less than $11 billion in 1989, down 25 percent from 1988 and 33
percent below the 1987 peak.
   ``Payments are projected to drop another 15 percent this year,''
the report said. ``Most of the decrease reflects less disaster
assistance.''
   The disaster aid last year totaled nearly $3 billion but may be
less than $500 million in 1990, barring widespread drought.
   According to a new outlook report for May, 1990 net cash income
is expected to be in the range of $54 billion to $58 billion,
unchanged from the April forecast. Federal payments could drop to
between $9 billion and $10 billion.

   The farm price of milk has dropped sharply
from the record highs of last winter and probably will ease down
further this year, a cording to an Agriculture Department report.
   Analysts said this is a time of ``conflicting indications of the
supply-demand balance'' in the dairy markets.
   ``Milk production has resumed expansion, and falling
international prices of non-fat dry milk have demolished
opportunities for commercial exports,'' the report said Thursday.
   But domestic demand has been strong, both commercially and to
rebuild depleted inventories.
   Milk prices at the farm probably will slip in the coming months,
and ``the onset of seasonal increases may be delayed,'' the report
said. Overall, the farm price of milk in 1990 may average 4 percent
to 9 percent below last year's all-milk price of $13.51 per
hundredweight.
   ``Cheese use is not expected to be strong enough to compensate
for the loss of commercial exports of non-fat dry milk as well as a
likely 2 percent increase in annual milk production,'' the report
said. ``Although a surge in cheese sales would not be
unprecedented, it has rarely occurred.''
   Consumer prices of dairy products as a group in early 1990 rose
more than 10 percent from a year earlier, greatly exceeding the
overall increases in retail food and consumer prices.
   ``Retail dairy prices probably will trend down in coming months,
although any signs of strength in wholesale prices will tend to
lessen and delay retail price declines,'' the report said.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
everyone should take part in Earth Day activities and consider the
role of the nation's farmers.
   Yeutter on Thursday planted a tree and signed a proclamation
formally asking ``the agricultural community and all people of the
United States to celebrate American agriculture's dedication to
productivity, profitability and environmental responsibility.''
   The tree-planting in front of Agriculture Department
headquarters was part of this week's events leading up to Sunday's
20th anniversary of Earth Day, first observed on April 22, 1970, as
a celebration of conservation of and the environment.

<TEXT>
   A Klansman wearing a white mask and
hood during a one-man demonstration struck a powerful chord of
violence and should have to abide by Georgia's anti-mask law, a
lawyer for a Jewish advocacy group said.
   ``The tradition of the Klan is a tradition of violence and
terrorism,'' Charles F. Wittenstein, southern counsel for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, testified Thursday. ``I
think it's hard to live in Georgia and not be aware of that history
and tradition of the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``Somebody seeing that (mask) would indeed feel threatened.''
   Wittenstein's testimony came during a hearing in Gwinnett County
State Court on the Klan member's challenge to a 1951 Georgia law
that prohibits wearing a mask in a public place.
   Klansman Shade Miller Jr., 27, of Calhoun is trying to have a
misdemeanor charge dismissed, contending it violates the
Constitution's guarantee of free speech. He testified Thursday he
wore the mask because he feared for his safety and his family's
safety.
   The offense for which Miller was arrested carries a maximum
$1,000 fine or a year in prison.
   Judge Howard E. Cook said he will rule on the case in about a
month.
   Miller was arrested in February after his demonstration in
downtown Lawrenceville, northeast of Atlanta. He said he joined the
Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in July 1988.
   Miller testified Thursday that he wore the mask with the Klan's
white robe and hood because he feared for his job and was afraid of
the consequences if his identity were known.
   ``A lot of people would most likely take my life if they knew
who I was,'' Miller said.
   David Fuller, Gwinnett's chief assistant solicitor, said the
truck driver wasn't employed at the time.
   Miller's lawyer, Michael Hauptman of Atlanta, asked him whether
the Klan robe, mask and hood, which were displayed on a mannequin
in the courtroom, had any symbolic meaning for him.
   ``Yes, it makes me feel very good,'' Miller said. ``I like it.''
   Hauptman argued that the anti-mask law is vague and open to
interpretation, and he called as a witness Edward K. Fields, a
former Klan organizer who said he believed the use of masks and
hoods helped people overcome fears of joining the KKK.
   State officials contend the law is clear and specifically
targeted at hate groups such as the Klan.
   The law prohibits the wearing of a hood or a mask to conceal
one's identity when on public property. Exceptions include holiday
costumes on the day of the holiday masks for use in sports,
theatrical garb or gas masks.
   Both Wittenstein and Earl Shinhoster, Southeast regional
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, said they feared KKK membership would grow if the anti-mask
law were repealed.
   Shinhoster said the Klan has a history of ``invoking terror,
harassment, intimidation or carrying out acts of violence.''

<HEAD>Cervical Cancer Deaths Falling, But Blacks Still at Greatest Risk</HEAD>

   Black women are more likely than white women to
undergo testing for cervical cancer, but their death rate is more
than twice as high, federal health researchers say.
   Annual cervical cancer death rates in the United States declined
from 4.2 deaths per 100,000 women in 1980 to 3.4 in 1987, the
national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   But although the rate among black women fell from 10.1 per
100,000 in 1980 to 7.6 in 1987, that remains more than twice the
white rate, which dropped from 3.6 to 2.9.
   The racial difference in cervical cancer rates is ``substantial
and persistent,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The CDC attributed the disparity in death rates to generally
lower socioeconomic status among blacks and a higher incidence rate
of cervical cancer.
   The racial disparity comes as preliminary CDC reports indicate
that black women are actually more likely than whites to undergo
cancer-screening Pap tests.
   ``A higher proportion of black women ... report having been
screened,'' the CDC said, citing a yet unpublished study. Further
details are not yet available, CDC researchers said Thursday.
   Lower screening rates for black women in previous years may be
contributing now to higher death rates in older black women, said
CDC cancer researcher Eddas Bennett.
   ``Previously, black women were screened less frequently than
white women, and it takes some years for it to catch up (in
decreased deaths),'' she said.
   But, the CDC said, ``for younger black women who were screened
more frequently than their white counterparts, disparities in
follow-up and treatment may have contributed to excess cervical
cancer mortality.''
   ``If you're screened, it often comes down to a question of
whether you actually received the appropriate follow-up
(treatment),'' Bennett said.
   Overall, the CDC said, deaths from cervical cancer in the United
States dropped 11 percent in seven years, from 5,537 in 1980 to
4,951 in 1987, the latest year for which detailed reports are
available.
   ``That's primarily from the increased use of screening,''
Bennett said.
   Virtually all cervical cancer deaths are preventable with early
detection _ chiefly through Pap test screening _ and treatment when
necessary, the CDC said.

<HEAD>Jetliner Pilot Gets `Climb,' `Descend' Orders From Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A system that uses a computer voice to tell a
jetliner pilot how to avoid an impending midair collision is being
installed for the first time in a commercial air carrier fleet.
   ``Climb! Climb! Climb!'' ordered a male voice generated by the
Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System built into a new USAir
jetliner. All large airliners must have the units by the end of
1993.
   A miniature air traffic screen in the cockpit showed a red dot,
pinpointing a plane that was coming dangerously close. Ordinarily,
pilots have to rely on what they see out the cockpit window or what
air traffic controllers tell them is in the vicinity.
   With a series of maneuvers between a small plane and the Boeing
737-400 airliner carrying industry and government officials and
news people Thursday, pilots demonstrated the system, known as TCAS
II, that must be installed in all airliners with more than 30 seats
by the end of 1993.
   Commuter airliners and other smaller passenger planes are
required to have a less-sophisticated version, TCAS I, which emits
traffic warnings when other planes come too near, but does not tell
the pilot what to do.
   Congress has ordered that one-fifth of each carrier's airliners
have the TCAS II units installed before the end of this year at a
per-plane cost of about $125,000.
   The bill for the entire U.S. fleet is expected to exceed $450
million. Airlines put the cost at closer to $1 billion, figuring in
labor and lost profits during installation, which takes about five
days.
   Repeatedly on Thursday's flight from Washington National
Airport, the small plane came on a collision course with the USAir
jet.
   Each time, the TCAS screen showed the location of the intruding
aircraft and a voice from a speaker in the cockpit ceiling gave
quick, precise instructions to the pilot. They began with
``Traffic!'' and ended with `Clear of conflict'' as passengers
watched the small plane whiz by within a few hundred feet of the
airliner.
   If two TCAS computers meet in the sky, they communicate with
each other, and one pilot is told to ``climb'' and the other to
``descend'' or maintain altitude.
   An even more sophisticated third generation of the system, TCAS
III, is being developed to give pilots horizontal instructions as
well.
   The TCAS system gives the pilot a miniature air traffic control
system in the sky, displaying aircraft within a 40-mile radius. It
can only detect planes with transponders that emit radar signals.
All but the smallest private planes have transponders.
   USAir officials said their Boeing 737 is the first commercial
airplane to be equipped and certificated by the FAA with the TCAS
unit.
   Northwest, United and Piedmont, now apart of USAir, equipped
planes with test versions of TCAS when the system was being
evaluated by the FAA.
   Three companies manufacture TCAS systems that meet FAA
specifications. The ones being put on USAir's fleet are made by
Allied-Signal Aerospace's Bendix-King Air Transport Avionics
Division.
   Other manufacturers are the Air Transport Systems Division of
Honeywell Inc., and the Collins division of Rockwell International
Corp.
   ``From the pilot's perspective, the new TCAS technology provides
an added margin of safety,'' said Capt. Norman Bush, USAir flight
training manager. He said pilots would have to undergo only about
90 minutes of training to learn to use the system, which is
expected to be put into operation in the first dozen or more planes
by mid-June.
   Tom McSweeney, an FAA official aboard the demonstration flight,
said the system would have the added benefit of making it easier
for pilots to maintain proper separation from other aircraft during
landings and give them more information in areas not covered by air
traffic controllers.
   The system, however, is seen only as a backup to controllers who
monitor all flights and have responsibility for maintaining safe
distances between aircraft, particularly those the pilots cannot
see out of the cockpit window.
   The FAA originally required that all large airliners have TCAS
by the end of 1991, but last week issued final rules which require
them to be phased in by the end of 1993.
   The phase-in period will enable the FAA to evaluate the system
after it has been installed in 20 percent of the fleet.

<TEXT>
   A sheriff who commandeered a National
Guard armory because he was fed up with turning criminals loose for
lack of jail space has forced state authorities to provide a new
temporary jail.
   Nine weeks after Hampden County Sheriff Michael J. Ashe Jr.
seized the armory in Springfield, its 44 inmates were moved
Thursday to a closed, renovated armory in the neighboring western
Massachusetts city of Holyoke, authorities said.
   ``Our intent was to be able to implement sentences ... whether
it requires the Springfield armory or the Holyoke armory,'' said
Ashe, quietly savoring his victory. ``We're now able to sentence
people and take them to jail in this county.''
   Ashe, who is well-known for his innovative rehabilitation
programs, dubbed his new jail a ``Community Service Center'' and
assigned to it prisoners working on various projects around the
county.
   Some of the prisoners work at an office furniture factory at the
jail, others at the jail farm or picking litter along state
roadways. A special contingent of 15 prisoners is being detailed to
work on Holyoke projects, including cleaning vacant lots and
helping street crews fix potholes in the financially strapped city,
said jail spokesman Richard McCarthy.
   Ashe, who has a master's degree in social work, gave up asking
the state for help and seized the Springfield armory Feb. 16. Since
1988, when the inmate population reached 724, his century-old
lockup for 279 prisoners has been under a federal court order
limiting occupancy to 500.
   Armed with a 17th-century statute allowing sheriffs to demand
aid and assistance in the execution of their office, Ashe simply
walked in and occupied the armory.
   His action on the eve of the three-day Presidents Day weekend
caught state and National Guard officials by surprise. When they
returned after the holiday, the sheriff had installed more than a
dozen prisoners, obtained a court order prohibiting the state from
evicting him, and had public opinion firmly in his corner.
   State officials initially condemned the move, but three weeks
later proposed a compromise under which the sheriff agreed to
vacate the facility being actively used by the National Guard, and
move his overflow prisoners to the Holyoke armory, renovated with
$118,000 in state funds.
   Most of the money went to fix up a basement in the 84-year-old
building for a large inmate dormitory.

<HEAD>Crackdown on Cheats Could Burden Honest Taxpayers, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reducing the $100 billion-plus gap between the
federal income taxes owed and paid on legal earnings could impose
some unpleasant burdens on those who don't cheat, congressional
auditors say.
   It could mean higher prices for a roof replacement or fresh
vegetables, more paperwork for small businesses and perhaps even
withholding taxes from interest and dividends.
   The Internal Revenue Service told Congress on Thursday that the
tax gap is growing and likely to reach $100 billion this year and
$127 billion by 1992. It's a pile of money that large draws heavy
interest from lawmakers concerned about a lingering deficit and
demands for new programs.
   ``There are no quick fixes,'' IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg
Jr. reminded the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.
Closing the gap, he said, will require tougher enforcement efforts
as well as better assistance to taxpayers.
   Paul L. Posner, associate director of the General Accounting
Office, said catching the wayward dollars will require some risks.
   ``New administrative or paperwork burdens may be opposed by IRS
and others,'' Posner said. ``Taxpayers' support may diminish when
better enforcement, such as expanded information reporting,
increases paperwork burdens along with the prices of goods and
services from businesses and informal suppliers,'' such as roadside
vendors and home-repair workers.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, offered these
suggestions for improving enforcement:
   _Require that income taxes be withheld from some payments made
to one-owner businesses. The GAO noted some non-government
authorities are calling for restoration of withholding from
interest and dividends, an idea that Congress approved in 1982 and
repealed because of public opposition a year later.
   _Use information from local licensing records to identify
informal suppliers who may not report income, including child-care
providers and others who usually deal in cash.
   _Require that those who make certain payments to corporations
file reports with the IRS, in much the same way that a bank now
must report payment of interest to an individual.
   _Crack down on corporations that use taxes withheld from workers
to support a failing business.
   Goldberg said the IRS will be able to close only about
one-quarter of the tax gap with existing enforcement efforts.
   In 1987, the latest year for which complete figures are
available, U.S. individuals and businesses should have paid $505
billion in income tax, Goldberg said. Without any prodding by the
IRS, they paid $411 billion, leaving a gross tax gap of $94 billion.
   IRS enforcement measures, including audits and computer matching
of earnings reports against returns, brought in $22 billion and
left a net gap of $72 billion.
   The biggest causes of the tax gap were: informal suppliers'
failure to report income, accounting for $24.3 billion or almost 26
percent of the gap; large corporations, almost $17 billion; failure
to pay taxes due at the time a return is filed, nearly $8 billion;
failure to file individual returns, more than $7 billion; cheating
on capital gains, $6.7 billion, and overstated deductions and
exemptions, over $6 billion.
   The tax gap includes only income tax on legal earnings. It does
not count Social Security, excise or estate taxes on legal income
or any type of tax on illegal earnings, such as drug peddling and
prostitution. It also excludes taxes assessed by the IRS but left
unpaid for several years; these accounts receivable now total a
cumulative $87 billion.
   The IRS estimates that individuals voluntarily pay about 83
percent of what they owe, corporations about 88 percent.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
subcommittee, said the tax gap is a major threat. ``American
taxpayers who voluntarily pay their fair share of the country's
revenue needs will not support a tax system that tolerates
widespread cheating,'' he said.

   Police using sledgehammers spent
four hours dislodging a body encased in concrete and hidden for
five months in the basement of a house.
   A woman living there went to police and told them she ``could no
longer live with the terrible secret,'' police Capt. Gabriel
DiBernardo said Thursday.
   Elaine La Dolce told police that Chester Stawiasz, 36, died Nov.
7 when her boyfriend, Paul Garland, 40, forced him into a bath of
scalding water because he was dirty, DiBernando said.
   LaDolce told police she heard the victim screaming from the
bathroom but did not see what happened, DiBernardo said. Police
said a blow with a blunt instrument fractured Staiasz' skull and
caused his death.
   Garland turned himself in Thursday and was to be arraigned on
second-degree murder charges today, police said. His 18-year-old
son, Michael, who allegedly dragged the body into the basement,
faced a charge of hindering prosecution.
   The victim shared the house with Garland and La Dolce in this
city 10 miles north of Buffalo.
   Police said Garland poured concrete around the body and
threatened to kill his girlfriend if she told anyone about the
death.
   Garland allegedly tried to dig a grave in the basement but could
not break through the floor, DiBernando said. Instead, he built a
wooden vault around the body and encased it in concrete.
   DiBernardo, who called the case the most bizarre incident he has
seen in 30 years of police work, said Garland and Stawiasz both
worked in a Buffalo supermarket repairing shopping carts.

<HEAD>Key Bills Stalled in Senate Over Tax Cut Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican threat to force Senate action on
President Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut has stalled a pair
of the biggest bills before Congress: child care and Central
American aid.
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., a leading backer of the Bush tax
plan, said through a spokeswoman Thursday that he may try to force
a vote on the tax cut when the Senate takes up child care.
   But Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, strongly opposes
the capital gains change, and congressional sources said he decided
this week to hold up action on aid Bush wants for Panama and
Nicaragua until the threat to add the tax amendment is withdrawn.
   The administration wants to cut the tax on capital gains _ the
profit on the sale of investments _ from the current 28 or 33
percent to less than 20 percent on the theory that it would help
spur the economy.
   Although the Senate and House have already passed
multibillion-dollar child care assistance bills, a parliamentary
vote is needed in the Senate before negotiations with the House
over a final version can begin.
   Julia Brim-Edwards, Packwood's press secretary, said the senator
considers the child care bill ``a good vehicle'' for adding a
child-care amendment.
   Fred McClure, the White House's liaison to Congress, told
reporters that the administration had been informed that its
request for $800 million for the two Central American countries
would go nowhere unless the child care measure is released.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., also a supporter of the
child care bill, said Wednesday that he hoped conferees would be
named on the measure relatively soon but sidestepped the question
of whether there was a problem the bill's progress.
   Mitchell's spokeswoman, Diane Dewhirst, said he hoped to get the
child care bill into a conference committee quickly.
   The White House had hoped to have its supplemental aid package
passed by next Tuesday, when Violeta Chamorro is sworn in as the
new president of Nicaragua replacing the leftist Sandinista
government strongly opposed by the Bush and Reagan administrations.
But even before this dispute arose, the measure's progress had been
slowed by a host of unrelated issues.
   The House late last month approved its child care bill, which
would expand tax credits for poor families for the cost of child
care and would provide federal money for local governments to set
up new day-care programs in the public schools.
   It would also expand the Heat Start program for poor children
and create a system of state-issued subsidy vouchers for parents
who want to use religious day-care centers.
   The capital gains cut passed the House last year.

<HEAD>London Subways Scented to Counter `Lavatorial Smell'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some London subway riders are sniffing the
fragrance of apple blossoms and hyacinths instead of what one
transport official calls ``the armpit atmosphere'' usually wafting
through the city's dank tunnels.
   A pilot project that began Thursday will scent subway cars on
the busy East London line, which carries 6 million people each year
between Whitechapel and New Cross Gate, under the Thames River and
through 6.1 miles of tunnels nearly 150 years old.
   Passengers generally approved of the new sweet smells, but not
without reservation.
   ``It's better than the usual smell of wet dog,'' said John
O'Connor, on his way to work at a London hospital. ``I just hope
they don't put on too much.''
   Ian Derbyshire, general manager of the East London line who is
overseeing the project, said: ``We conducted a survey last year and
people did not appreciate the armpit atmosphere.
   ``There was a certain lavatorial smell, which is a historic
feature, especially in the stations near the river, that seemed to
get stronger at low tide.
   ``We reckoned it would be better to have a nicer aroma ... like
in a bathroom,'' he said, as a cloying chemical scent drifted up
the stairway from the track.
   Like potpourri sachets buried in a lingerie drawer, small paper
packets of fragrance have been hidden behind seats on each car.
When a passenger leans back, the packet emits a whiff of apple
blossoms, roses, hyacinths, lemons, mandarins, wood or a sea breeze.
   The scents were selected by CPL Fragrances for their ability to
make people feel relaxed and friendly, said Tony Satchell, a
salesman with the company, which provided the sachets free.
   ``Just think, when you are sitting at the seaside, you feel
relaxed, don't you? Well, it's because of the way it smells,'' he
said.
   Satchell is hoping that fragrances will soon be found throughout
the London Underground, known as ``the tube.''
   ``We'd like to go on to other smelly places, like Paris,''
Satchell said. ``I hear Austria smells, too.''
   London Transport says this is the last part of a $16 million
program to improve the East London line. More trains are being
added, cars are getting coats of graffiti-resistant paint, signals
and security are being improved and stations are being renovated.
   Officials insist the improvements are unrelated to the recent
rise in the number of young professionals now riding the line,
which runs through slums to the expensive Docklands housing and
commercial development.
   Not all riders were delighted with the new olfactory ambience,
however.
   Rosella Beltrane, a vacationing teacher from Italy, sniffed: ``I
think they should clean the trains first. They are revolting. It is
like a person who doesn't wash and puts on perfume instead. It's
nice, but it's not enough.''
   And not everyone noticed.
   ``My sense of smell is not that good,'' said A.C. Onile, on his
way home from work as a night guard. ``I heard somebody say,
`something smells.' But the only thing I can remember smelling on
this train was vomit, so I didn't pay much attention.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was on the receiving end of
the Andreas family's generosity on May 25, 1988 _ to the tune of
$8,000.
   The eight $1,000 donations to the Democratic presidential
candidate's campaign from members of the family came just a day
after nine members contributed $1,000 each to another party cause,
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Those checks would barely have time to clear before the
Republican Party got a $35,000 share of the Andreas family's
wealth. On June 1, seven family members made $5,000 donations to
the Republican National Committee.
   For the Andreas family, the bipartisan generosity was not at all
unusual.
   Led by Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the grain-trading giant
Archer Daniels Midland Co., family members are prolific donors to
campaigns and causes associated with both major political parties,
giving more than $500,000 in the past decade alone.
   The family's coordinated approach to campaign contributions is a
textbook example of how major donors can enlist their families to
broaden their political impact. Critics of the campaign finance
system complain that these coordinated donations allow rich donors
to circumvent contribution limits adopted after Watergate to lessen
the influence of the wealthy.
   Indeed, even with contributions flowing from other members of
the family, both Dwayne Andreas and his wife, Dorothy Inez Andreas,
in the 1988 election cycle exceeded the $25,000 limit on
contributions to federally regulated campaigns, according to an
Associated Press review of FEC records.
   The AP review of FEC records for the past decade shows Dwayne
Andreas exceeded the $25,000 limit in the last four election cycles
_ 1981-82, 1983-84, 1985-86 and 1987-88 _ and is nearing the cap
with six months left in the current two-year cycle.
   Andreas and his wife are by no means the only wealthy Americans
to exceed the $25,000 limit, exposing what critics call a glaring
weakness of the FEC's enforcement efforts.
   ``It is a difficult provision of the law for us to monitor,''
said commission spokeswoman Sharon Snyder. ``We don't always have
the resources for that kind of audit work, particularly in election
years.''
   In fund-raising circles, Dwayne Andreas ranks among the elite of
the ``switch-hitters,'' influential donors who spread their
contributions among both major political parties.
   In business circles, he is a legend for his friendships with
Washington's power brokers, including presidents dating back to
Harry S. Truman, and more recently his private meetings with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Asked for comment, Claudia Madding, an aide to Andreas said:
``We do not discuss personal donations made by members of the
Andreas family.'' Andreas himself did not immediately return a
telephone message Ms. Madding said she would forward to him.
   Dwayne Andreas, once a major backer of Democrat Hubert Humphrey,
more recently has emerged as a major supporter of Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, donating hundreds of thousands of
dollars to Dole's campaigns, political action committee and
tax-exempt foundation.
   When Dole was seeking the presidency in 1988, Andreas, his wife,
children and their spouses gave $10,000 to the Dole effort but also
contributed $30,000 to six other presidential hopefuls.
   The contributions included $9,000 to fellow Greek-American
Michael Dukakis and $1,000 to the man who defeated Dole for the
Republican nomination _ George Bush. Andreas later was among the
$100,000 donors to the GOP's so-called ``soft money'' campaign.
   Archer Daniels Midland's political action committee also gave to
four of the presidential candidates.
   FEC records show Andreas family members donated at least
$550,000 to House, Senate and presidential candidates and political
party organizations involved in elections over the last decade.
   The giving appeared to cross party lines indiscriminately while
perhaps favoring lawmakers in states where Archer Daniels Midland
has major plants, such as Illinois.
   One of that state's favorite sons, House Republican Leader Bob
Michel, was the Andreas family favorite last Sept. 6. Seven family
members in three states each donated $1,000 that day to the
Michel's 1990 re-election.
   Before the day was out, another $7,000 came into Michel's
coffers in $1,000 donations from seven Archer Daniels Midland
officials. Three weeks earlier, the company's PAC had donated
$2,000 to Michel, whose district abuts ADM's headquarters in
Decatur, Ill.
   For Florida Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, his day as the family
favorite would come two months after Michel's, on Nov. 10, 1989,
when eight family members donated $500 each to his campaign.
   That $4,000 was dwarfed by the $14,000 received by Massachusetts
Democrat Joseph Kennedy from the family on April 28, 1986.
   Kennedy, facing a primary race in his successful attempt to take

   A House committee that last year focused on
helping children born addicted to drugs is shifting its attention
to high-risk mothers.
   A former drug addict and alcoholic who blames her substance
abuse for her daughter's retardation told her story Thursday as the
House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families launched an
investigation into these women's needs.
   The woman, identified only as Kathleen X, said she was 14 when
she began using heroin and alcohol.
   She said that over the next 16 years, she had five children. Two
are normal, two died in infancy and one is mentally retarded,
diagnosed this year as suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome.
   ``We now recognize that fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the
greatest causes of birth defects and mental retardation in the
United States,'' said Iris Smith, project director of the Georgia
Addiction, Pregnancy and Parenting Program in Atlanta.
   Infants born to alcoholic women are often premature, have low
birth weight and later display learning or behavioral disorders,
growth retardation and deficits in memory or attention, Smith told
the House panel.
   Kathleen X testified that she would promise her children she
would stop using drugs and alcohol, ``but I could never keep that
promise.''
   She said she finally became clean six years ago when she entered
a long-term treatment program. She is now regional director of
community outreach and education for a drug treatment center in the
Maryland suburbs of Washington.
   Committee Chairman George Miller, D-Calif., noted that Kathleen
X is white and grew up in an affluent area. He said her story
illustrated that the problem affects all socioeconomic groups.
   Dr. Sheila B. Blume of South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, N.Y.,
said efforts must be made to identify addicted women early.
   ``Pregnancy is the best time to treat an alcoholic woman or a
chemically dependent woman,'' she said. ``The incentive to have the
healthiest possible infant is the best motivator.''
   Kathleen X concurred. ``When I became pregnant, I would stop
using the illegal drugs because in my mind I said, `I cannot shoot
heroin any more,''' she said. ``So I drank white wine. Back then no
one said there was anything wrong with that.''
   Education can work for some women at risk, Smith said. She
referred to a 1986 study by the Emory University School of Medicine
that found that 35 percent of women informed of the potential harm
of alcohol use during pregnancy stopped drinking.

   Nicole Ravesi's baby sitter was awfully fond of
the girl, so fond that her mother got a court order to keep the
baby sitter away.
   But a week after Denise Ravesi told Kenneth Cole he could never
see her daugher again, 5-year-old Nicole disappeared, and police
say Cole kidnapped the girl.
   Police have received tips on Cole's whereabouts, Milford police
Detective Edward Pomponio said Thursday night.
   In the meantime, Mrs. Ravesi is crossing her fingers.
   ``I have a lot of hope that the FBI is doing the best they
can,'' she said. Cole, 24, was described as a quiet, shy young man.
Mrs. Ravesi said he became obsessed with the little girl, for whom
he frequently baby-sat.
   Nicole reciprocated Cole's affection, and neither Mrs. Ravesi
nor investigators felt the girl was in danger.
   ``He has genuine strong feelings for her welfare. I don't think
he would intentionally harm her,'' said FBI spokesman Paul Cavanagh.
   But Mrs. Ravesi is convinced that Cole intends ``to take her and
raise her as his own girl.''
   When Nicole was hospitalized for a hip infection, Cole visited
often, and was seen kissing the little girl on the lips, hospital
staff said.
   By February, Nicole's parents had become so concerned they
obtained a court injunction prohibiting Cole from seeing their
daughter for five days. But when the ban was lifted, Cole was still
attached to the child.
   ``It was like an addiction,'' said Mrs. Ravesi, 34. ``He could
never separate from her, that was a big deal, he could never just
say `Hi' and `Bye' and everywhere he went, whatever he did, he
needed Nicole nearby. Wouldn't that be obsession?''
   In late March, the Ravesis told Cole he could never see Nicole
again. Others told Cole the Ravesis planned to move from their
suburban Milford home before the summer was out.
   On April 3, Cole allegedly abducted Nicole as she waited with
her older sister in a parked car for Mrs. Ravesi, a school bus
driver, to finish her route, police said.
   ``I think the biggest reason he did this was he felt she might
forget him over time and he was right. In time, she would,'' Mrs.
Ravesi said.
   Investigators found Cole's mother's car parked outside an Amtrak
station in Providence, R.I., April 7. Hundreds of phone calls have
come in since Nicole's story was featured on the television program
``America's Most Wanted.''
   Mrs. Ravesi, who has taken a leave of absence from her job, said
she wishes that Nicole would be allowed to contact her.
   ``The message I would give to him would be to allow Nicole to
draw a picture and send it to me,'' Mrs. Ravesi said. ``A letter
from her would be real nice, just so I know she's all right.''

<HEAD>Thrift's Portfolio Had Millions in Hidden Losses, Court Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association's real
estate and loan portfolio included hundreds of millions of dollars
in unrecorded losses, says the regulator in charge of the
institution's takeover.
   Keith Seibold of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Thursday
countered charges by Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., that
regulators arbitrarily reduced the value of the thrift's holdings.
   Seibold said officials spent three months evaluating the
security of each loan and physically inspecting Lincoln's real
estate holdings in Arizona, Texas, Colorado and other states.
   When they were through, they estimated the S&amp;L was $631 million
in the red at the end of June 1989, up from a negative net worth of
$66 million only three months earlier, he said in U.S. District
Court.
   The losses had swelled to $1.5 billion by the end of the 1989
and continue to mount at a rate of $20 million a month, he said
Thursday, testifying in the 26th day of hearings in Keating's suit
to recover Lincoln from regulators.
   Seibold also testified that regulators found records missing on
the day of the takeover, April 14, 1989, and that they immediately
were forced to stem a severe run by depositors.
   ``It is probably one of the most chaotic situations I have been
involved with in my 20 years with the FDIC,'' Seibold told Judge
Stanley Sporkin.
   To obtain missing loan documents and credit files, regulators
had to resort to bartering with officials of American Continental
Corp. of Phoenix, the parent company of Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln, Seibold said.
   He said they swapped artwork in Lincoln's offices for files in
possession of the holding company.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Keating told reporters later, dismissing
Seibold's sworn testimony as ``total misstatement'' and ``lies.''
   Seibold also said that Lincoln had so few assets capable of
being easily sold that it became the first S&amp;L forced to seek an
emergency loan from the Federal Reserve Board to meet the demands
of depositors, who withdrew $110 million in the first three days
under government control.
   ``A run itself is not that unusual ... but this was something
entirely different in ... the hostility and virtual panic on the
part of depositors,'' Seibold said. ``We searched the asset
structure to find some assets good enough to sell or pledge, but we
couldn't find them.''
   Seibold said only 3 percent of Lincoln's loans were traditional
home mortgages. Most of the rest were construction and development
projects. In 79 percent of the loans, Lincoln had either provided
the borrower with the money to meet the first several years of
interest payments or required no interest payments until the loan
came due, he said.
   That disguised the fact that many were bad loans, Seibold said,
adding that delinquent loans went from $182 million at the end of
March 1989 to $1 billion a year later.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, called on the Justice Department to seize
the assets of S&amp;L owners such as Keating ``living high on the hog
off their ill-gotten gains.''
   ``People like Charles Keating are free to fly first class across
the nation, stay in luxury hotel suites, hire armies of attorneys
and file suits against the federal government using funds that
should be part of the recovery for the deposit insurance funds,''
Gonzalez said.
   ``The Justice Department does not have to stand by while the
government's money is being dissipated in this manner,'' he said.
   Gonzalez made the Lincoln case prominent nationwide by holding
hearings on the failure last fall. Keating asserted his
constitutional protection against self-incrimination in refusing to
testify to Gonzalez's panel, but he took the stand for eight days
in his own suit.
   ``The congressman doesn't like to see the truth come out in the
courtroom,'' Keating told reporters. ``It conflicts with his view
of the case.''
   Sporkin is holding the court hearings before ruling on the
government's motion to dismiss Keating's suit. He has set today as
the last day of testimony and scheduled closing arguments in the
case for June 8.

   If you've ever fantasized about sharing your
bedroom with Tom Cruise or Kim Basinger, your videotape machine
with Rob Lowe and your dark passageways with the likes of Stephen
King, maybe your dreams can come true.
   Thanks to a company specializing in finding places to film
movies and commercials, your ticket to stardom may be your home.
   Valerie Bulinski and Mark McCarville don't scout for talent.
They shop for castles, gang-plagued neighborhoods and other
locations preferred by movie and commercial makers trying to outfox
a more discerning public.
   ``With commercials, we usually like large kitchens, large rooms
(crew members) can work in,'' Ms. Bulinski said. ``But with a
movie, it's a character, and you have to have some look that
surrounds them.''
   Ms. Bulinski and McCarville are partners in a 2-year-old company
called Location Consultants.
   They've been to Wisconsin for farms and steam engines, Michigan
for train stations, suburban Chicago for a castle and southern
Illinois for a forest.
   Ms. Bulinski said TV and movie directors prefer real homes and
places rather than stage creations because they want ``an authentic
look.''
   Viewers ``are getting a little too smart and look out a back
window (of a filmed scene) and see the difference between real
trees and a backdrop,'' McCarville said.
   Ms. Bulinski has been in the location-scouting business for five
years; McCarville, 10.
   Starting pay for their clients, the people who host production
crews, is about $700 a day and can climb to $1,600.
   The partners have worked on such movies as ``Midnight Run''
starring Robert DeNiro and ``Rent a Cop'' starring Burt Reynolds,
and such TV programs as ``Crime Story'' and ``Lady Blue.''
   Lynda Brooks is one of the company's busiest clients.
   Her Victorian home is filmed two or three times a year for
commercials, an industrial movie and last spring a made-for-TV
movie about the Howard Beach drama, ``Making the Case for Murder.''
   ``They like my house because I have such a huge kitchen,'' said
Mrs. Brooks, who lives in suburban Oak Brook.
   In the Howard Beach movie, her home was to belong to the film's
New York prosecutor, portrayed by Daniel J. Travanti.
   ``They had to dress my house down,'' Mrs. Brooks said. ``I have
a lot of art glass windows and they covered them with sheers
because they didn't want the prosecutor to look like he was on the
take.''
   The movie crew shot only about 2{ minutes of the film at the
house. Mrs. Brooks' pay: $1,600.
   Also, the host family and friends can watch filming if they stay
out of the way. Mrs. Brooks, a theater major in college, said she'd
love for Paul Newman or Robert Redford to star in a movie at her
house.
   ``I'm crazy about movie stars,'' she said.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship Industry Vulnerable to Major Accidents, Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans who take cruises each
year to rock in the lap of luxury are ignorant of dangers like
crews unprepared for emergencies and a lack of qualified
physicians, according to testimony at a congressional hearing.
   A disaster involving U.S. passengers is waiting to happen,
National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James L. Kolstad said
Thursday, arguing for greater U.S. control over safety and health
conditions on foreign-flag cruise ships operating from this country.
   ``The passenger industry operating from U.S. ports has had
accidents with a potential for large loss of life,'' he told a
House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee.
   Kolstad mentioned an engine-room fire in November 1988, as well
as two rammings by cruise ships of docked vessels and one ramming
of a boardwalk, all happening in Florida last year.
   The subcommittee is considering tighter restrictions as a result
of the blossoming of the domestic cruise ship industry in the last
15 years.
   According to testimony, 80 percent of the world's passenger
cruise ships operate from U.S. ports, carrying American passengers.
Although their owners are primarily U.S. companies, the ships sail
under foreign registry, so-called ``flags of convenience,''
allowing them to avoid U.S. labor and tax laws.
   Those mostly Panamanian- and Liberian-registered ships are
governed by the laws of their flag country when on international
waters.
   Referring to the Scandinavian Star fire that killed more than
160 people in the North Sea, Kolstad said the NTSB would have been
unable to investigate that accident had it happened in
international waters off Florida.
   The NTSB investigated a major fire aboard the same ship two
years ago in the Gulf of Mexico and ``identified some of the very
problem areas survivors have reported this past week,'' he said.
   But the NTSB's recommendations were unenforceable, he said.
   Among the complaints voiced by Kolstad and echoed by other
witnesses was that many ships lack licensed, certified doctors.
Many ships, he said, rely on medical students or paramedics.
   Many of the doctors on ships cannot communicate in English, and
the infirmaries often are ill-equipped, witnesses said.
   Kolstad noted that on most ships, the crews are so
linguistically diverse that they can hardly communicate among
themselves, let alone communicate with passengers in an emergency.
   Kolstad and other witnesses said crews often are not adequately
drilled for emergencies.
   He argued for spot inspections in U.S. ports by the Coast Guard,
rather than scheduled quarterly inspections.
   Opponents say the cruise operators would simply move to the
Bahamas and offer cheap fly-and-cruise packages for Americans if
they wanted to escape U.S. regulations.
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Joel D. Sipes disputed many of
Kolstad's assertions, saying that international agreements are
addressing safety concerns.
   He said language is less important than training in emergency
drills, and argued that the core of ship's officers often speak the
same language.
   ``We find most ships to be in compliance,'' he said, urging
respect for the ``national sovereignty'' of the ship.

<HEAD>Ortega Says War Isn't Over, Despite Accords to Dismantle Contras</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite a pact to disband the Contras,
President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguans can't be sure their
9-year-old civil war is over until the last rebel lays down his gun.
   The Contras signed an accord Thursday with the United National
Opposition and the Sandinistas to begin turning in their weapons
next Wednesday, the day the 14-party bloc and President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro are to take office.
   The Contras are to give up all of their arms by June 10, and all
sides agreed to a cease-fire that went into effect at noon Thursday.
   There has been widespread speculation the Sandinista government
might not transfer power as pledged _ despite its loss in Feb. 25
elections _ if the Contras did not disarm.
   The situation has created an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, and
Ortega appealed for trust.
   ``We still can't say that peace has arrived, but we can say
today that we are much closer to peace and are distancing ourselves
from war,'' he said after a meeting with Bernard Aronson, the U.S.
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   ``The war will have disappeared on the moment that all the
Contras have disarmed, and the deadline is June 10,'' he said.
   Aronson made no comments during his one-day visit to Managua,
except when he came out of Mrs. Chamorro's home and told reporters
the two had discussed ``economics, the transition, the peace
process'' and ``the economic assistance thing.''
   President Bush has asked Congress to approve $300 million in aid
to help Mrs. Chamorro revive Nicaragua's battered economy.
   An estimated 30,000 people were killed by the civil war in this
country of 3 million. There are about 9,000 Contras in Nicaragua.
   They waged their insurgency against the Sandinistas from
Honduran border camps and with U.S. aid. But the United States cut
off military aid in February 1988, the fighting tapered to sporadic
battles and most of the rebels have slipped back into the country.
   Mrs. Chamorro and Ortega had asked them to disband.
   ``I'm very happy; we don't want war any more, we want peace, we
want reconciliation,'' she said after meeting with Aronson. ``Like
I told Daniel (Ortega) yesterday ... all of us have to give each
other a helping hand, forgive.''
   Following 14 hours of talks, the Contras, the
Sandinista-controlled army, UNO officials and Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua signed the accord.
   The agreement also calls for Sandinista military forces to
complete their withdrawal from five rebel security zones and for
the guerrillas to begin concentrating immediately in those areas.
   Another agreement between the Sandinista army and the Miskito
Indian rebels, who are allied with the Contras, established a
cease-fire that started at midnight Thursday in the sparsely
populated eastern half of Nicaragua. It calls for the
demobilization of the Indian rebel force by May 18.
   Missions of the United Nations and Organization of American
States were charged with supervising the accords.
   The incoming UNO government seemed to gain the most.
   The Sandinistas had threatened general strikes and other actions
if the Contras did not demobilize by inauguration day, and there
was always the threat of armed clashes and even renewed civil war.
   Earlier, the Contras had demanded the Sandinista army be
neutralized as a condition for disbanding their forces.
   Thursday's accords do not address that demand. However, under an
accord with Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the Sandinistas had already
agreed to depoliticize the army and reduce its size. In exchange,
the incoming government promised to ``respect the integrity and
professionalism'' of the armed forces.
   The fears of disruption in the transfer of power have hinged
largely on whether the army would be willing to yield authority to
the new government.
   ``With this accord, we conclude the peace process that started
with the elections,'' said Antonio Lacayo, senior negotiator for
Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``Let it be clear that what has been signed here is something
serious, something formal, and I think that we all have the good
will to fulfill this signed document,'' said Oscar Sovalbarro, the
Contras' senior negotiator.
   Sandinista army Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and
brother of the president, said he was satisfied with what he called
a peace effort reached ``in a profound, serious way, with a great
spirit of responsibility.''
   However, not all Sandinistas were happy with the idea of letting
the Contras retain their arms after April 25, and a pro-Sandinista
mob surrounded a U.S. Embassy station wagon carrying Aronson as it
was leaving the Managua airport Thursday morning.
   The mob pounded on the sides and windows of the vehicle,
demanding that the Contras demobilize immediately. No one was
reported injured.

   While not yet acting on President Bush's
request for $300 million in aid to the incoming Nicaraguan
government of Violeta Chamorro, the Senate is moving to restore
trade benefits to the Central American country.
   On a voice vote without dissent, the Senate approved an
amendment Thursday lifting trade sanctions imposed in 1985 as part
of an embargo against the regime of President Daniel Ortega.
   The amendment by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., was one of
several to a bill making permanent the duty-free status given a
wide variety of imports from 24 Caribbean and Central American
nations under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
   The House approved a similar bill last fall making the
initiative permanent beyond 1995, when it is scheduled to expire.
However, the House rejected attempts to expand the list of
duty-free items to include shoes and clothing that would compete
with U.S.-made products.
   Bush called for the aid package and the restoration of trade
relations with Nicaragua after Ortega was defeated by Mrs. Chamorro
in a Feb. 25 election. Mrs. Chamorro is to be inaugurated next
Wednesday.
   The House approved the aid package before Easter. Among the
trade benefits are restoring Nicaragua's sugar quota, which could
bring the country $33 million by the end of the year, according to
State Department officials.
   Prior to the embargo, Nicaraguan exports of coffee, bananas and
other products to the United States totaled $57 million in 1984,
and U.S. exports there totaled $112 million. By last year, two-day
trade between the countries had dribbled to less than $5 million.
   Also without dissent, the Senate approved an amendment urging
Bush to consider extending the duty-free status now enjoyed by the
Caribbean and Central American countries to Peru, Colombia and
Bolivia.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said the amendment is intended to
encourage the countries to develop economic alternatives to cocaine.
   ``The Andean region of South America is the source for 100
percent of the world's supply of cocaine,'' he said. ``We all agree
that all routes to reducing cocaine production should be explored.''
   Approved on a 90-3 vote was an amendment by Sen. William Roth,
D-Del., making it easier for importers to win temporary suspensions
of tariffs if no one raises valid objections.
   Such suspensions now have to be approved by Congress. Roth said
some importers now must wait for years because of delays in acting
on duty suspension requests by the House Ways and Means Committee,
where trade and tax legislation must originate.
   The amendment would allow a president to suspend a tariff after
an investigation by the International Trade Commission if Congress
does not act on a request within a year.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., opposed the amendment, saying it
forfeits to the president powers specifically delegated to Congress
by the Constitution.
   Also voting against Roth's amendment were Sens. John Danforth,
R-Mo., and Dave Durenberger, R-Minn.

   Senate Republicans are divided on how far to
go in trying to limit the influence of corporate, labor and
ideological political action committees in election campaigns.
   But they say they are united in wanting to stop the so-called
``soft'' unreported money spent on campaigns by unions.
   ``We made, I think, substantial progress in developing a unified
position,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said upon emerging from an
hour-long GOP strategy meeting Thursday on campaign finance reform.
   However, others among more than 20 Republican senators who
attended the meeting in party leader Bob Dole's office said there
was no resolution on several issues.
   With Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, intent on
beginning Senate debate next week on a campaign finance bill,
Democrats were planning to huddle today on their strategy.
   ``This is the most partisan issue that the Senate will deal with
this year,'' said McConnell, whose selection by Dole to manage the
GOP side of the debate is viewed by several Democrats as an omen of
a bitter fight ahead.
   McConnell was among the leaders of a Republican filibuster that
Democrats failed to break two years ago when they unsuccessfully
tried to establish taxpayer financing of campaigns and limit how
much candidates can spend.
   Democrats want to impose a spending limit of $400,000 on House
candidates and ceilings ranging from $950,000 to $5.5 billion in
Senate races, depending on a state's voting-age population.
   Democratic leaders, however, have abandoned any attempt to win
public financing.
   Lawmakers anticipate that after a few days of debate, party
leaders and the administration will begin working on a compromise
behind closed doors, just as they did with a clean air bill
approved before Easter.
   Bush wants an outright abolition of PACs, which have tended in
recent elections overwhelmingly to favor incumbent lawmakers. Since
Democrats hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they have
enjoyed PAC largess more than Republicans.
   The Democratic bill would retain the current $5,000 limit a PAC
can contribute to a candidate for each primary, runoff and general
election but impose a ceiling on the total PAC contributions a
candidate can receive.
   ``We spent a lot of time talking about the PAC issue and how far
to go in bashing them,'' McConnell said. ``We (Republicans) do have
some strong defenders of PACs.''
   McConnell divided members of his party into three camps on the
issue:
   _Those who want to go along with Bush and abolish PACs outright.
   _Those who would reduce the amount a PAC can contribute to a
candidate for each primary, runoff and general election to $1,000.
   _And those who want to abolish labor and corporate PACs but
allow contributions of up to $1,000 from issue-oriented,
unconnected PACs such as those of the National Rife Association and
environmental groups.
   A few Republicans, McConnell said, also endorsed the idea of
so-called flexible ceilings placing no limit on how much a
candidate can raise from home-state residents but capping
contributions from out-of-state donors.
   ``I still believe that the president _ a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee _ will veto a bill that has spending
limits, in or out of state,'' said McConnell, a strong opponent of
ceilings.
   Republicans, he said, are united on abolishing the use of
so-called ``soft'' unreported money by unions and other tax-exempt
organizations for voter registration drives.
   Academic experts have estimated that unions spent up to $45
million of such money in the 1988 election _ almost all of it
benefiting Democrats.
   And it was through a tax-exempt California voter registration
project headed by the son of Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston,
that Phoenix savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. gave
$850,000 of the total $1.3 million contributed to five senators.
   ``If you're tax-exempt, you shouldn't be playing the political
game,'' said Dole. ``If we're really concerned about cleaning up
the campaign sewer money, then it's about time to spray the sewer
stench with a big can of legislative Lysol.''

<HEAD>Marla Maples: I Do Love Donald Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Model Marla Maples declared her love for Donald
Trump on national television, but declined to characterize her
relationship with the developer whose billions are in the sights of
his estranged wife.
   Maples, said to be the ``other woman'' in the much-discussed
divorce case of Donald and Ivana Trump, was interviewed on a
segment of ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' that aired Thursday night.
   Her frosted blonde hair cascading in waves over the shoulders of
her peach-colored suit, Maples spoke demurely, haltingly at times.
But she never appeared flustered by the questions, even the meaty
ones, which she politely declined to answer.
   She would not say how she met Trump, nor would she comment on a
reported confrontation she had with Mrs. Trump in Aspen, Colo.,
where the Trumps vacationed last year.
   The segment was taped Wednesday in a house owned by Trump's
friends, Jack and Caroline Davis, in Atlantic City, N.J., where
Trump recently opened the glitzy Taj Mahal casino.
   Was she the reason for the Trump split?
   ``Only the two of them know what really went wrong with their
marriage. But I'm not the reason for that marriage having
problems,'' she said, adding: ``As Donald has said himself, `People
just grow apart.'''
   Asked about a story in which an unnamed friend of Maples quoted
her as saying ``the best sex I ever had'' was with Trump, Maples
responded: ``It's just an absolute, total lie that I said it.''
   When interviewer Diane Sawyer asked her straight out if it was
the best sex she ever had, Maples said: ``Diane, that has nothing
to do with why I'm here.''
   Maples said Trump approved of her doing the interview,
apparently her first since the divorce story broke in February. ``I
made sure of that.''
   Settlement of the divorce suit, in which Mrs. Trump is
challenging the legitimacy of a marital contract that limited her
alimony to a mere $25 million, might depend in part on questions of
fidelity.
   ``Do you love him?'' Sawyer asked Maples.
   ``I do love him,'' answered Maples.
   ``Do you want to marry him?'' Sawyer asked.
   ``I'm taking my life day by day. I am just hoping to go on,''
Maples said. ``I mean who knows what life is going to bring in the
future? I have no control over that.''

<HEAD>WHO to Take Part in AIDS Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization, which
considered withdrawing as sponsor of an upcoming AIDS conference in
protest of U.S. immigration policies, will participate but is
urging the Bush administration to drop all entry restrictions on
people with AIDS.
   WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima, in a statement released
in Geneva and in Washington on Thursday, welcomed the
administration's effort to make it easier for people infected with
the AIDS virus to attend the conference in San Francisco in June.
   ``However, WHO views the situation as not completely
satisfactory and strongly urges the United States to continue its
efforts to drop all travel restrictions against HIV-infected
persons,'' the head of the United Nations agency added.
   The administration last Friday announced a new 10-day visa for
foreigners attending certain White House-approved professional,
business and scientific conferences in the United States.
   Travelers obtaining the visa will not have to reveal whether
they are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
which causes AIDS.
   Pressure had been building on the administration to take action
that would quell the growing protest of U.S. travel restrictions.
   Dozens of organizations and the governments of France and
Switzerland have indicated they will not send representatives to
the conference because of the restrictions. Additionally, the
European Parliament has called on scientists not to attend the
conference.
   Nakajima gave initial indications to the U.S. government on
Wednesday that WHO would announce Thursday that it would remain
co-sponsor of the conference but would delay a decision on whether
to attend, said administration sources who demanded anonymity.
   However, after consulting with Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan and others, Nakajima decided that WHO
would attend, one source said.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration has
no plans to ease travel restrictions further, ``but obviously we
continue to study the situation.''
   Dana Van Gorder, a spokesman for the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS, said the administration's announcement of the
visa last week has had ``virtually no impact'' on the groups that
have said they will boycott.
   ``I know of no organization that has changed its policy based on
last Friday's announcement,'' Van Gorder said by telephone from San
Francisco.
   He said that about one-third of the 7,000 delegates that have
registered for the conference are from other countries. But he said
he knows of about 100 organizations that have indicated they would
not participate because of the travel restrictions.
   Van Gorder said he welcomed the WHO decision to attend as well
as the organization's promise to continue efforts to get all travel
restrictions
   ``WHO participation in the conference is important to the major
goal of ours, which is distributing updated scientific information,
particularly in developing countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>NEA Chairman: Anti-Pornography Minister Uses Distortion,
Intimidation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the National Endowment of the
Arts is accusing a pornography-fighting minister of using
distortion and intimidation to eliminate federal funding for his
agency.
   John E. Frohnmayer said Thursday he was drafting a letter to the
Rev. Donald Wildmon, founder and executive director of the American
Family Association in Tupelo, Miss.
   ``I simply have suggested to the Rev. Wildmon that he should pay
attention to the commandment against bearing false witness,'' the
nation's top arts official said.
   ``I respect his right to speak freely on the issue but I do not
respect his use of falsehoods or half-truths or intimidation,''
Frohnmayer said. ``I have repeatedly stated my opposition to
obscenity in any form.''
   Wildmon so objected to homosexual images from the catalogue of a
federally funded exhibition at Illinois State University that he
photocopied and mailed them to all members of Congress.
   Sealed inside envelopes marked ``extremely offensive material
enclosed'' were 14 explicit photographs and drawings from the
``David Wojnarowicz, Tongues of Flame'' show mounted with a $15,000
NEA grant. The exhibition at the University Galleries in Normal,
Ill., ran through early March.
   Wildmon's accompanying letter, which asked the lawmakers to
``clean up the NEA or abolish the agency altogether,'' included
several distortions, Frohnmayer said.
   He said Wildmon wrote that the Illinois show went on view in
January, after Frohnmayer's appointment and after Congress forbade
NEA financing of art that ``may be considered'' obscene and without
``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
   But Frohnmayer said the grant was approved before the fall
passage of the restrictions and prior to his appointment by
President Bush.
   Since receiving Wildmon's mailing, several lawmakers have
questioned whether to reauthorize the independent federal agency.
It provides seed money for such mainstream activities as opera,
dance and theater.
   Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., says he's ready to deny funding to
the NEA.
   ``They have got to adopt policies that keep this type of
pornographic art from being displayed,'' Saxton said. His office
received nearly 300 postcards from constituents contacted by
Wildmon.
   His colleague, Rep. Dean Gallo, R-N.J., complained in a letter
to Frohnmayer that in supporting the Illinois exhibit, the NEA
jeopardized worthy local projects.
   ``Frankly, support for the NEA is fast disintegrating among
members of Congress and our constituencies,'' Gallo wrote.
   But some lawmakers said they hadn't seen Wildmon's letter and
the photos.
   The offices of three congressmen involved in arts funding, Rep.
Sidney Yates, D-Ill., Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., and Rep. Bob
Carr, D-Mich., reported Thursday that they had not seen the mailing.
   Staffers for Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said they threw it
out before it reached the boss's desk.
   Such conservative lawmakers as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., have attacked the NEA for
supporting exhibitions of controversial art by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   In recent testimony before committees handling NEA
reauthorization, Frohnmayer has proposed modifying the grant
process to ``make sure we know exactly what we're being asked to
fund ... before the money actually goes out.''
   But overall, Frohnmayer says the issue has been distorted.
   ``It seems to me that the Rev. Wildmon and others have whipped
up a fair amount of hysteria on the basis of a very few images,''
Frohnmayer said.
   ``We're talking about maybe 20 images out of a million that we
funded. And maybe 20 to 25 grants out of 85,000 grants that we have
given in the last 24 years,'' Frohnmayer said.
   ``To suggest that this agency is a purveyor of pornography or is
somehow out of control simply ignores the 99.99 percent of the work
that we have done that has received nothing but praise.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed slightly lower against the yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar ended the week at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen from
Thursday's close of 157.75 yen. After opening lower at 156.78 yen,
the currency ranged between 156.73 yen and 157.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 109.97
points, or 0.37 percent, closing the week at 29,835.44. The Nikkei
index gained 696.35 points on Thursday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
10-year government bond was 86.33 points as of 3:00 p.m., down from
Thursday's close of 86.45. The yield rose to 7.295 percent from the
previous day's close at 7.270 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's weakness followed from its
overnight decline in New York, where it fell to 157.25 yen from
158.125 yen Wednesday.
   Many dealers attributed the yen's modest recovery after weeks of
decline to a range of events, notably reported comments from U.S.
Treasury officials that they viewed the dollar as too strong.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said
trading was more active in cross-trading between the yen and West
German mark rather than between the dollar and the yen.
   ``The dollar seems to be in a box range,'' Tanahashi said.
   Securities dealers said the yen's strength helped support the
stock market.
   ``The stock market began making a full-fledged recovery in the
past couple of days, though there remains some some mixed
sentiment,'' said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, an analyst with Daiwa
Securities.
   Nishiguchi said investors were showing a ``strong hunting
interest.''

   A non-profit company is
testing a loose-fitting, plastic condom that could prove to be more
resilient and comfortable than the standard latex variety.
   Family Health International would not reveal details about the
contraceptive, but it is said to resemble a sandwich bag.
   ``Generally people's faces have a look of surprise or amusement
when they see them,'' said Thomas Brookshire, a physician's
assistant at Planned Parenthood in Raleigh, which is testing the
device. ``They just don't look like condoms.''
   ``We're testing for acceptability _ comfort, ease of use, how
people like them,'' Brookshire said. ``We want to make sure they
are not so weird no one will use them.''
   The clinic has 25 couples participating in the test, he said.
   Family Health International has been researching the new condom
for about a year and a half, said William Schellstede, senior vice
president.
   The company provides family planning and AIDS-prevention
assistance to developing countries and is seeking a contraceptive
that has a longer shelf life than latex, which can deteriorate
easily if not properly stored.

<TEXT>
   When she was made the butt of Charles Hurth
III's prank, Maia Brodie vowed revenge, and she got it _ taking a
$27,500 bite out of his wallet.
   ``I feel the damages were appropriate,'' Brodie said Thursday
after jurors upheld her civil lawsuit against Hurth for biting her
buttocks in a bar 2{ years ago.
   Brodie said the reward would help ease her humiliation.
   She was at the bar near St. Louis University, where she studied
law, in September 1987 when Hurth grabbed her hips and bit her,
Brodie testified. Hurth and his friends laughed, pointed and
exchanged high-fives, she said.
   The bite broke the skin on Brodie's buttocks, causing ``searing
and throbbing pain'' so severe she couldn't sit down for three days
and was unable to attend classes, said Gerald Greiman, her lawyer.
   Hurth, a lawyer, admitted biting Brodie but said he did not mean
to hurt her and considered his action a compliment. Hurth testified
he had previously bitten the buttocks of two other women at
fraternity parties in 1981 and 1982 while attending Vanderbilt
University.
   Jurors deliberated about 90 minutes after hearing two days of
testimony, awarding Brodie $2,500 in actual damages and $25,000 in
punitive damages.
   David Hoven, who represented Hurth, described Brodie's injury
and the lawsuit as ``superficial,'' arguing she should be awarded
only the $9 she paid for medication to prevent infection.

<TEXT>
   Divers recovered 10 of 20 bodies from
the wreckage of a twin-engine plane 90 feet underwater off a
Pacific resort island near Panama, an aviation official said.
   The recovery operation near Contadora Island was suspended
Thursday because of darkness, Panamanian civil aviation director
Jaime Fabrega said at a news conference.
   There was no word whether the bodies of the four Americans had
been recovered.
   Two people, a French boy and a Swiss woman, were rescued after
the Aeroperlas Twin Otter en route from Contadora to Panama City
crashed shortly after takeoff Wednesday. They were in stable
condition in a hospital on Thursday.
   Divers found the wreckage no more than a mile north of Contadora
Island, aviation officials said in a statement. They said the
ocean's currents carried the wreckage from the crash site, three
miles south of the island.
   ``The plane is practically intact except for the front part''
and was found in 90 feet of water, Fabrega said.
   He declined to confirm the airline's statement Wednesday that
birds colliding with the right engine caused the crash.
   ``Something happened with the right engine, but anything I would
say would be mere speculation,'' he said.
   Fabrega said the pilot had nearly 7,000 hours of flight time,
and the plane was ``in perfect condition.''
   U.S. military personnel, two Blackhawk helicopters and two
65-foot boats joined Panamanian planes and rescuers in the search.
   The U.S. Embassy identified the Americans as Karl Heck, a Panama
Canal pilot and his wife, Anita, of Panama City; Lisa Langlow, 34,
originally of Washington state, and whose family lives in Fox
Island, Wash.; and Richard Dobson Poux, also of Washington state.
   Also killed were two French citizens and 14 Panamanians, most of
whom worked on the island, where the late Panamanian leader Omar
Torrijos gave refuge for several months to the Shah of Iran,
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the shah's 1979 exile.

<HEAD>Army Rejects Combat Test Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has rejected a suggestion for a
four-year test to see how women would do in combat-related jobs.
   ``The Army does not feel that a test is warranted. We feel our
current policy reflects the intent of Congress by excluding women
from the highest risk of direct combat,'' the Army said Thursday in
a statement.
   The proposal from a test came last fall from the Defense
Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a panel founded in
1951 to advise the Department of Defense on women's issues.
   In its statement, the Army said its policy of barring women from
direct combat is ``in line with the other services.''
   ``We currently offer women full career opportunities and
maintain equitable advancement in schooling and promotion selection
rates,'' the Army statement said.
   By law, women in the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps can not be
assigned on ``vessels or in aircraft that are engaged in combat
missions.''
   But it is Army policy, not law, that bars women from
participating in its primary fighting elements such as infantry,
tank and most artillery units.
   As experience in the invasion of Panama showed, women do serve
in many of the Army's supply or support units that could place them
in the thick of battle.
   Last fall the committee said the limitation denies women
``hands-on experience to learn and to progress in a specialty. ...
The services can ill afford to continue to limit these women and
their experiences in the face of the anticipated manpower shortages
of the 1990s.''
   At the end of 1989, there were some 229,000 women in the Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marines, or 11 percent of the 2 million-strong
uniformed services.

   A religious soldier has been jailed for
threatening to shoot two fellow soldiers who ate bread during
Passover and made scathing remarks about a leading rabbi, the army
said today.
   The devout soldier was sentenced to 28 days in the stockade for
his threat, and the other two were given 14 days each for mocking
the religious beliefs of a fellow soldier, an army spokesman said.
   The army bars the eating of bread on bases during Passover,
which commemorates the flight of the Jews from slavery in Egypt.
Jews eat unleavened matzah during the eight-day holiday to
symbolize the hasty escape in which the Jews did not have time to
make real bread.
   The confrontation came at a base in central Israel where the
three soldiers were talking politics, Israeli newspapers and radio
reported.
   When the two secular soldiers criticized Rabbi Eliezer Schach
and began eating bread, the religious soldier cocked his gun and
threatened to shoot them, according to the reports. The two secular
soldiers calmed him down, the reports said.
   Schach, 96, is the spiritual leader of two ultra-Orthodox
political parties. He has been at the center of a controversy over
whether small religious parties have too much power in Israeli
politics.

released Thursday by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
It was translated from Arabic into English by The Associated Press
in Beirut.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the occasion of the international day of Jerusalem, the
organization of the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine
reminds Islamic nations throughout the world of the sacred central
cause and calls upon the free revolutionary strugglers to mark this
day with demonstrations and parades to whip up sentiments to uproot
the cancer and continue the struggle against global arrogance.
   This year the issue of Jewish emigration is throwing an added
burden on the shoulders of revolutionaries in the whole world,
prodding them to exert efforts and take measures to stop it by
suicidal operations against all who participate in this matter,
especially those countries offering transit facilities.
   The organization serves this final warning after the advice had
been handed down on all those participating in this matter,
especially those countries offering transit facilities. All
civilians should stay away from the airports, airlines and
jetliners that will be the targets for operations mounted at times
we deem adequate.
   It cautions the revolutionary holy warriors that the principal
danger which threatens them is the deviationist proposals that
undermine our people's uprising _ seeking to grab the helm of the
uprising's leadership while it is in fact following a policy that
gives Israel peacefully what it has failed to get up till now by
war. The Palestinian deviationist leaderships will not be immune
from the just revenge and punishment.
   Our people should realize that all schemes hatched by global
arrogance for elections or for the destiny of the (West) Bank and
the (Gaza) sector are aimed at shielding the Zionist Nazis and
finishing off the uprising. They do not intend to help our people
because the criminal arrogance seeks to slaughter this struggling
people and not grant it any of its rights.
   Let no one imagine that he can achieve anything from Hosni
Mubarak or the traitor King (Hussein) or deviationist Arafat or the
others. Their treason shall remain stamped in our people's memory.
The hands of the strugglers will reach all of them.
   On this occasion, we salute our brethren in Zionist jails. We
shall spare no effort to liberate them and freedom, god willing,
will be soon. We single out the struggling Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid,
whose detention stands as a slap to the cowards.
   As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and
finalized. But (John) Kelly's failure to respond has so far
frustrated the release, which made us postpone this operation until
the picture is cleared.
   Until then, we hope that Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, President
Assad's envoy, will head to Beirut to wrap up the issue upon
arrival of Kelly in Damascus.

<HEAD>Bob Hope Grants 5,600 Acres to Land Conservation Agency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bob Hope is donating about 1,800 acres of his
mountain property and selling another 3,800 acres for $20 million
to a state agency to spare the rugged canyon country from
development, his attorney says.
   ``This is a wonderful Earth Day present from Mr. Hope to the
people of California and the wildlife of the Santa Monica
Mountains,'' said Carl Pope, deputy conservation director of the
Sierra Club. Sunday is the 20th celebration of Earth Day, the event
that kicked off the environmental crusade.
   The agreement signed by Hope, yet to be finalized, will open his
coastal parkland to hikers and allow it to continue to serve as a
corridor for migratory wildlife.
   The 86-year-old comedian has endured negative publicity in
recent months over his sale of mountain lands to prospective
developers and his refusal to consider giving or selling the land
to park agencies. Hope has been acquiring land in the region for 35
years.
   The $20 million price tag on some 3,800 acres in the Santa
Susana Mountains is below market value, Hope's lawyer, Payson
Wolff, said Thursday. Most of the property lies inside Ventura
County, and the rest is in Los Angeles County.
   ``Once again, Bob Hope has proven to be a generous supporter of
the city,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said.
   The deal is certain to be ranked as one of the largest parklands
bequests in Southern California.
   Wolff credited Madge Schaefer, chairman of the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors, with planting the seeds in Hope's mind more
than a year ago that yielded his bequest.
   ``I'm delighted!'' Schaefer said Thursday night. ``It took quite
a bit to ask him to give one more dime, but I'm glad I did.''
   Hope's contribution will help create public parklands extending
from the inland Santa Clarita Valley about 50 miles out to the
Pacific Ocean, Schaefer said.
   Wolff said Hope's change of heart came after meeting with
conservationists.
   ``I believe that he was motivated by the sincerity of some of
the real, responsible conservationists who impressed on him and
convinced him the importance of having this property preserved in
public parklands forever,'' Wolff said.
   ``The criticism that's been leveled at Mr. Hope as not being
charitable, as not being a good citizen ... was
counterproductive,'' Wolff said. As recently as March, Hope told
The Associated Press that the criticism ``bugs the hell out of me.''
   The proposed agreement would transfer more than 80 percent of
the entertainer's land to the Mountains Recreation and Conservation
Authority, a public agency.
   The centerpiece of the deal is the 4,369-acre Runkle ranch that
straddles the Los Angeles-Ventura county line. The rugged property
above the Santa Susana Pass includes canyons, meadows and
spectacular rock formations.
   In addition, the agreement would put an end to plans to build a
golf course and country club on land Hope owns in Corral Canyon in
the seaside colony of Malibu. Hope would proceed with the sale of
adjacent land to a La Jolla developer, which still proposes a
scaled-down residential development.

   A twin-engine airplane crashed on a city street
early today while attempting an emergency landing just after
liftoff. The pilot was killed.
   The pilot, apparently the only person aboard the small
Beechcraft plane, radioed a distress signal to air controllers
after one engine failed and was trying to return to Love Field,
airport operations manager Clifford York said.
   The plane clipped power lines, flipped and crashed about 1 a.m.
on a street adjacent to the airport, three miles northwest of
downtown Dallas.
   Authorities said no one on the ground was injured.
   York said did not know the pilot's identify, and was unsure
where the aircraft had been headed.
   A witness, Ken Helms, 19, said he was parked at a traffic light
when he saw the plane in distress.
   ``I was going to turn right, but when the light turned green I
went straight. If I'd turned right, I'd have driven right into
it,'' he said. ``The plane did a 180 in the air. The plane went
upside down and exploded when it hit the ground. The flames just
covered the whole street.''

<HEAD>Kennedys Fight Historical Status for Estate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kennedys are fighting plans to
designate as an historical site the seaside estate where John F.
Kennedy held Cabinet meetings and played touch football on the
beach with family and friends.
   The Kennedy clan has hired a prominent local attorney to fight
Palm Beach's efforts to give official landmark status to the $3
million ``La Guerida'' compound, which served as a winter White
House three decades ago.
   But there can be no winner in the dispute, said James Sullivan,
chairman of the Palm Beach landmarks commission, which today
examines the town's proposal to designate the Mediterranean
revival-style mansion and its grounds.
   ``No matter what happens, the damage has been done,'' Sullivan
said. ``The Kennedys have lost an opportunity to acknowledge the
significance of a home that played such an important role in our
nation's history.
   ``And it's a slap to the local community who have welcomed the
Kennedy family for years.''
   If the commission approves the landmark status, a final vote
will be taken by the Town Council on June 11.
   Elizabeth Burden, an attorney for Kennedy family matriarch Rose
Kennedy, said she will fight the historical designation on the
grounds that it violated Mrs. Kennedy's right to due legal process.
   The estate, built in 1925 for department store mogul Redman
Wanamaker, will be among more than 30 structures up for landmark
consideration, Sullivan said.
   ``It's very, very unusual for any homeowner to fight the
designation, and none have done so to the extent of the Kennedys,''
said Sullivan. ``They have spent oodles of money on this, and I
really can't figure out why.''
   The Kennedy family maintains it wants to retain complete control
over the estate, and that might be compromised by the landmark
designation. Such a designation also could make the house less
marketable to others desiring to change the property.
   Under town ordinance, residents considering more than $2,000
worth of structural or cosmetic changes to their homes must receive
approval from one of two boards. If the home is deemed a historical
site, the landmarks commission must authorize the changes.
   Although 99-year-old Rose Kennedy no longer spends winters in
Palm Beach, the estate is still used by family members, including
Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.

   Forty-six Australian veterans, some
over 100 years old, left today for Turkey to commemorate the World
War II campaign at Gallipoli, regarded as one of the great military
defeats of the war.
   They flew on board a specially configured Qantas Boeing 747-300
jet that included a mini-hospital staffed by Royal Australian Air
Force surgeons in case any of the veterans became ill during the
trip.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke and other members of the government sat
in the back, and the veterans traveled first-class in front of the
plane.
   The oldest was 103, and the trip was expected to be difficult
for some of the veterans, all at least 90. To break up the journey,
the group was to spend 30 hours in Singapore before flying to the
site of the battles.
   The veterans were scheduled to arrive in Istanbul on Sunday.
   Jack Hazlitt, 92, was a ``runner,'' _ or dispatcher of military
cables _ at Gallipoli.
   ``We thought it was a glorious chance to see the world for
nothing,'' he said. ``That attitude didn't last long. Very few of
us survived. You could say I'm one of the lucky ones.''
   Australia lost more than 8,000 soldiers.
   Most of the Australian soldiers were called ``diggers,'' and
93-year-old George Mitchell said the term developed because ``all
we did (when not fighting) was to dig, dig, and dig trenches.''
   The veterans will take part in ceremonies on the Gallipoli
Peninsula on Wednesday to commemorate the troop landings in 1915 by
Australian, New Zealand, British, French and Indian troops.
   In World War I, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was allied with
Germany and Austria against Britain, its dominions, France and
Russia.
   The Gallipoli Peninsula lies on the northern side of the
Dardanelles Strait in northwestern Turkey. The object of the
campaign, which military historians call the first combined naval
and land operation of modern warfare, was to open the Turkish
straits to Russia; capture Istanbul, then known as Constantinople;
and take the Ottoman Empire out of the war.
   Gallipoli was a battleground for nine months, until the invading
forces were evacuated in December 1915 and January 1916.
   The total casualty list for the invaders was 33,532 killed,
78,518 wounded and 7,689 missing. Of these, 8,587 Australians were
killed and 19,367 wounded.
   The battle gave the Turks a modern hero, Kemal Ataturk, who made
his name as a military genius in Gallipoli.
   Australia commemorates the campaign each year with a national
day of remembrance for those killed in the 1914-18 War and for
those who gave their lives in other wars.
   ``In the Australian consciousness, two things stand out about
Gallipoli,'' said Bob Carr, leader of the Labor opposition in the
state of New South Wales. ``First, the courage and valor of our
troops, and second, that it was a defeat, a military disaster.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground slightly against the yen
today, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange recorded a
moderate decline.
   The dollar closed the week at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen from
Thursday's close of 157.75 yen. After opening lower at 156.78 yen,
the currency ranged between 156.73 yen and 157.75 yen.
   ``The dollar was bought in the afternoon session for position
adjustments with the approach of the weekend,'' said Norio Takeda,
a dealer of the Bank of Tokyo.
   Takeda said the dollar seems to be in what dealers call a ``box
range,'' when the currency's movement in either direction can
trigger selling or buying for profit taking, loss cutting or
technical adjustment.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference this
morning that he remained concerned with foreign exchange market
movements despite the yen's recent recovery.
   ``I expect the exchange market to stabilize with the yen
appreciating (against the dollar) a bit more,'' Hashimoto said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 109.97 points, or 0.37 percent, to close the week at
29,835.44. The Nikkei index gained nearly 150 points in the early
morning session.
   A total of 700 million shares changed hands in the first
section, down from 1 billion shares Thursday.
   The index ``fell nearly 300 points at one point in the afternoon
session'' when news that an Osaka-based retailer went bankrupt with
$445 million in liabilities, said Yoshiro Inoue, an equity analyst
with Nomura Securities.
   Inoue said the company, Pari, suffered the debt because of
losses on the stock market.
   For the past few years many Japanese companies have earned
profits by putting surplus or borrowed funds into the booming stock
market, a tactic not directly related to their main business.
   The market's main barometer so far this year has lost 8,970.46
points, or 23 percent, from a record 38,915.87 points registered at
the end of last year.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
10-year government bond closed at 86.36 points, down from
Thursday's close of 86.45. The yield stood at 7.290 percent, up
from the previous day's close at 7.270 percent.

<TEXT>
   The latest in a nerve-wracking series of
aftershocks to a Feb. 28 earthquake rattled parts of Southern
California, but no injuries or damage were reported.
   The temblor Thursday night, centered about 5 miles west of
Upland, registered 3.5 on the Richter scale, said Robert Finn, a
spokesman for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   ``We're becoming a model city for earthquakes, you know,''
police Sgt. Dan Milakovich said. ``We must be leading the nation.''
   The tremor felt in areas of San Bernardino County and eastern
Los Angeles County was an aftershock of a 5.5-magnitude quake that
struck near Upland on Feb. 28, Finn said.
   Hundreds of noticeable quakes have shuddered through the area
since the Upland quake, including a 4.6-magnitude temblor and
several smaller aftershocks Tuesday.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 5.5 reflects a quake 10 times as
strong as one of 4.5.

<HEAD>Britain To Give Passports To 225,000 Hong Kong Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Parliament voted to guarantee
citizenship to about 225,000 Hong Kong residents, but China
complained today the move will hasten an exodus from the colony
before the Chinese takeover in 1997.
   Defying predictions of possible defeat, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative administration comfortably won a House of
Commons vote on the issue Thursday night.
   The chamber approved the bill 313-216. Supporters triumphed over
opposition from right-wingers in the governing party who oppose
more immigration and leaders of the socialist opposition Labor
Party who called the bill elitist.
   Because of that allied opposition, the bill was regarded as one
of the toughest legislative tests for Mrs. Thatcher's government
since she took power in 1979.
   It now will be examined by a Commons committee, but it is
virtually assured of becoming law later this year.
   British officials say the bill would help prevent a mass flight
of residents from the colony on the southeastern coast of China.
   Hong Kong is suffering a crisis of confidence because of worries
over what will happen once Communist China takes over. More than
1,000 people are emigrating each week, including many who are among
the colony's best educated.
   Home Secretary David Waddington has argued that giving British
citizenship to 50,000 key Hong Kong residents and their families
would prevent a brain drain and maintain confidence in the colony
before it reverts to China in 1997.
   China has said the colony can keep its capitalist economy for 50
years after the transfer, and it has pledged to allow local
autonomy.
   A statement released today in Hong Kong by the Xinhua News
Agency, which is the Chinese diplomatic mission there, said the
plan would be divisive and encourage more talented people to flee
the territory.
   In the statement, released just hours after the vote, Xinhua
reiterated that Beijing regards Hong Kong Chinese as its citizens
whose nationality can be determined only by its laws.
   It said the British plan was a scheme to have British people
governing Hong Kong after 1997, but it did not elaborate.
   China will ``reserve the right to take appropriate measures'' in
response, the statement said, again without elaborating.
   Labor Party leaders had told their members to vote against the
bill on grounds that only Hong Kong's elite _ business people,
administrators, senior police officers and others _ would be given
passports.
   A report today from the Henley Center, an independent economic
forecasting group, said such immigrants would likely fill skill
shortages in Britain in the coming decade because they are
professional people who speak English.
   The report, commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corp., was
written by economics Professor Bernard Corry of London University
and two other professors.
   It said Hong Kong immigrants ``are likely to be highly
adaptable. They should thus be quickly in a position to adjust to
the new labor market circumstances in which they find themselves.''

   Owners of restaurants and bars where alcohol
is served are fighting a law forcing them to post signs warning
that beer, wine and liquor can cause birth defects, addiction and
intoxication.
   The Florida Restaurant Association filed suit Wednesday in
Circuit Court challenging the constitutionality of the Hillsborough
County ordinance.
   The restaurants were ordered to post signs warning patrons not
to drink during pregnancy, before driving or while taking either
prescription or non-prescription drugs. The signs were to include
the postscript: ``It can be fatal.''
   Attorneys for the trade group claimed the signs will cause
irreparable injury to the establishments. Restaurateurs complain
that the warnings are ineffective and stigmatize moderate drinkers.
   ``If one person reads that sign and it prevents someone from
getting hurt, that sign would be worth it,'' countered Commissioner
Phyllis Busansky.

   April showers were in store for much of the nation today, and
rising temperatures were in the offing.
   When the showers clear out, forecasters predicted, temperatures
would climb into the 80s and 90s in the South and into the 70s
throughout the rest of the country.
   The south-central United States, pounded by thunderstorms
Thursday, faced more of the same today. Small hail fell in parts of
Nebraska and Texas on Thursday, and recent heavy rains caused some
flooding in parts of Oklahoma.
   The National Weather Service warned that severe flooding could
occur in Okmulgee County, Okla., as the Deep Fork River rose toward
an expected crest Saturday of 7 feet above flood level.
   A flood warning also was posted for Beaver Creek in northern
Texas, which was nearly 3 feet above flood stage and rising.
   Showers and thunderstorms Thursday extended over parts of
Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyominc, Nebraska and South
Dakota.
   Heavy thunderstorms were expected today in the southern Plains
and from eastern Texas to Missouri. Scattered showers were
predicted for the South and the Tennessee Valley and from Illinois
to Maine.
   Showers also were to prevail in the West, with thunderstorms
possible across the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada.
   High temperature for the nation Thursday was 91 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has offered Latvia and
Estonia ``special status'' in a new Soviet confederation in a bid
to prevent them from following Lithuania's secession drive, Baltic
journalists and officials said.
   However, an Estonian government official said his republic was
unlikely to back down and declared that it was ``in the same boat''
as Lithuania.
   The Soviet president's proposals came at separate meetings in
Moscow on Thursday with leaders of the two Baltic republics.
   However, Endel Lippma, Estonia's minister for inter-governmental
negotiations, said Gorbachev also threatened the republic with
economic action and said he would not negotiate unless the
Estonians rescind a declaration that their republic is an occupied
independent state.
   The Soviets have imposed an energy embargo on Lithuania, which
declared independence March 11.
   Estonian and Latvia have not formally declared independence but
have said they want to pursue it.
   Gorbachev reportedly told their leaders the republics could
belong to a ``confederation,'' which could imply a major concession
because the Russian word is used for a loosely allied organization
like the British Commonwealth.
   Gorbachev previously spoke only of a ``federation,'' like the
United States, where the states have specific powers but the
national government is strong.
   However, Gorbachev did not define what he meant by
``confederation,'' Lippma said.
   Lippma reported in a telephone interview that Gorbachev said
``if some kind of blockade has to be imposed, part of the
population might get very angry and there would be bloodshed, and
in that case, he would impose presidential rule.''
   ``And then we would find out what occupation really is,'' Lippma
added.
   Presidential rule can include martial law and suspension of
parliament.
   Lippma said President Arnold Ruutel of Estonia likely will heed
Gorbachev's request that parliament formally reconsider the
Estonian declaration, probably on Monday. However, he said a
reversal was ``very unlikely.''
   ``We have no clear-cut commitment of what we would get in return
if we canceled it,'' he said. ``So Estonia and Lithuania are very
much in the same boat.''
   Similarly, Gorbachev told President Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia
and his delegation that he would not talk further if they declare
independence on May 3 as planned, said Aris Yansons, Gorbunov's
assistant.
   Gorbachev has said he believes disintegration of the Soviet
Union would lead to great ethnic violence. But that danger is
considered more likely in the volatile south than in the Baltic
region.
   Gorbachev's tone with the Latvians was highly critical, said
Raimons Lochmelis of the information office of the Latvian People's
Front. He based that assessment on comments on the meeting by
another participant, People's Front President Dainis Ivans.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov also promised that if
Latvia remains in the union, he would consider the republic's
demand that its draftees serve in the Soviet Army only on Latvian
soil, Yansons said.
   Lochemelis quoted Ivans as saying they found it very difficult
to persuade Gorbachev that independence is supported by most
Latvians, not just a few fanatics.

<HEAD>Roman Catholic Anti-Abortion Campaign Begets Problem for PR Firm</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plans by a large New York public relations
concern to direct an anti-abortion publicity campaign for the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops have incited rebellion in the
company's ranks.
   Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc. said Thursday it will go forward with the
project, despite continued protest from its workers. The bishops
intend to pay the firm up to $5 million over three to five years.
   About one-third of the company's headquarters staff signed a
letter of protest, arguing that the bishops seek to deny women a
basic right. Others have complained individually, and one quit.
   There could be other fallout: Two minor clients have withdrawn
and many others have expressed disappointment, according to
dissident executives who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear
of jeopardizing their careers.
   Playboy Enterprises Inc., which has hired Hill &amp; Knowlton in the
past, is undecided about using it again.
   ``Our decision will be impacted by our principles. We've been
longstanding supporters of reproductive rights,'' said Playboy
spokeswoman Robyn Radomski.
   Whatever Playboy's decision, she said, ``We feel it's
regrettable that such a big powerhouse PR firm has put itself in
such a bad PR situation.''
   The irony, dissident executives said, is that one of Hill &amp;
Knowlton's specialties is advising companies how to avoid just such
turmoil. They said its own failure could reflect poorly on the
company.
   ``We have used extraordinarily poor judgment in our very own
area of expertise,'' one said. ``The firm violated everything we
would advise a client to do about consulting employees. Every basic
rule was violated.''
   Hill &amp; Knowlton conceded no error.
   ``I don't think we've made a mistake as a firm in taking on this
account,'' said John Berard, a spokesman in the company's
Washington office, which will handle the work. ``We knew it was
going to be controversial.''
   The reaction of the company's staff was ``reflective of
society,'' Berard said. He said employees are not compelled to work
on projects to which they object.
   Although some Hill &amp; Knowlton employees objected primarily to
the company's lack of consultation with its staff, the protest
letter to Chief Executive Officer Robert Dilenschneider focused on
the issue of abortion itself.
   ``For management to seek out as well as accept an assignment
whose ultimate goal is to limit our fundamental rights leaves us
with a stinging sense of betrayal,'' the letter said in part. ``Our
rights, it seems, mattered less than the promise of additional
revenue.''
   Employees said 136 out of about 400 headquarters workers signed
the letter. Moreover, they said, several employees have offered to
provide free public relations advice to groups that advocate
abortion rights.
   Berard would not specify how the firm was responding to its
employees' concerns, saying that was an internal matter.
   ``We're certainly not denying that some of our people have
raised complaints,'' he said. ``We're not ignoring the comments of
some of our people. And we're moving forward to service our
client.''
   The public relations campaign for the bishops is undefined, but
is to start with a public opinion poll to gauge attitudes about
abortion, then proceed with ``a classic public information effort''
seeking to promote the bishops' anti-abortion views, Berard said.
   A spokesman for the bishops' conference had no comment on the
Hill &amp; Knowlton controversy.

<HEAD>GAO: Military Doesn't Know What's Buried At U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Glenn is pressing the Pentagon to
find out how much radioactive material is buried on military bases
so the government can figure out cleanup costs and the impact on
base-closing plans.
   ``None of the three services has a complete grip on what type
and how much low-level radioactive waste it has generated,'' said
Glenn, D-Ohio. On Thursday, he made public a report prepared at his
request by the General Accounting Office.
   Glenn said he wanted the auditors to figure out how much it will
cost the military to deal with its waste but they didn't have
enough information to even attempt an estimate. All they could say
with certainty was that the cost of disposing of the waste is going
to skyrocket.
   The Army has found that surcharges tacked onto the cost of
disposing of its low-level radioactive waste over the next few
years will be higher than the actual disposal cost, the senator
said.
   ``We can't even take a guess as to what the Navy and Air Force
may have to pay because they don't have accurate records,'' Glenn
said.

   The House Budget Committee has approved a plan
that preserves spending on the super collider at more than $300
million next year _ a level that falls short of the president's
request but exceeds Democratic leaders' initial recommendations.
   A plan backed by Democratic leaders could have brought spending
on the huge particle accelerator to $278 million in the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1, according to Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
   But Bryant said he was able Thursday to convince Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., to restore $40 million
of a proposed $60 million cut in spending on Department of Energy
science projects.
   Had the $60 million cut gone through, Bryant said two-thirds of
it _ or $40 million _ would likely have been shaved from the super
collider, bringing down SSC spending from $318 million to $278
million.
   Under the plan approved Thursday, the SSC would receive $304
million, said Bryant, a member of the committee.
   The SSC spending is part of a $1.24 trillion budget for fiscal
1991 approved on a 21-14 party-line vote. Debate in the full House
was scheduled for next week.
   The budget resolution serves as a general guide for
congressional authorizing and appropriating committees.

<HEAD>New Colt Rifle Prompts Call for Ban on Domestic Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a new Colt semiautomatic rifle comes
pressure on President Bush to support legislation banning
domestically produced assault-type weapons.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, wrote Thursday to Bush saying
Colt Manufacturing Co.'s new ``Sporter, just now arriving in
stores, is only slightly modified from the AR-15 assault-style
rifle which Colt Industries stopped producing for the civilian
market last year.
   Colt Manufacturing Co., the successor to the Colt Firearms
Division of Colt Industries Inc., says the Sporter differs
substantially from the AR-15 and is not an assault-style weapon.
   ``When your administration banned foreign-made assault weapons
last year, I said that it was a good first step toward protecting
the lives of innocent crime victims in general and law enforcement
officers in particular,'' Metzenbaum wrote to Bush.
   ``However, the failure to take the next logical step _ to
implement restrictions on American-made assault weapons _ defeats
the very purpose of your initiative,'' he said.
   Metzenbaum urged Bush to support a crime bill now in Congress
that would ban domestic assault-style weapons.

   Four people were killed in
black factional fighting and police units firing tear gas and
shotguns clashed with protesters and broke up demonstrations,
police said today.
   A police statement said four blacks had died in factional
battles in Natal Province during the previous 24 hours, including a
youth killed when police opened fire on a crowd that attacked
police with firebombs and rocks.
   Police used shotguns, pistols, rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse protesters in clashes at Katlehong, Zeerust, Smithfield,
Volksrust and other areas. Police gave few details but said several
clashes broke out when crowds attacked vehicles or homes belonging
to black police officers.
   Police also reported a hand grenade was hurled at the house of a
black city official in the black township of Soweto outside
Johannesburg and shots fired Thursday night. No injuries were
reported.
   Police Commissioner Lt. Gen. Johan van der Merwe said today he
had ordered a full investigation into the killing of four youths by
police. Police opened fire Thursday on protesters near
Viljoenskroon in the Orange Free State.
   The African National Congress, the black political organization,
denounced the killings.
   ``This is disgusting behavior on the part of the police and we
protest most strongly,'' said ANC leader Walter Sisulu.
   Police said five officers fired on a crowd of about 200 blacks
protesting about rent costs and other local problems. Press reports
today said the dead youths ranged in age from 13 to 16.
   ANC officials declined to say if they would take any action over
the killings.
   The ANC pulled out of peace talks with the white government last
month after police killed at least 11 blacks in March in the
township of Sebokeng when they fired on a protest march. President
F.W. de Klerk this week ordered an injuiry into the Sebokeng
killings.
   The ANC later agreed to reschedule talks with the government May
2-4 to try to clear the way for full-scale negotiations on ending
white-minority rule. The ANC is demanding an end to a state of
emergency as a precondition for full talks.
   De Klerk Thursday pledged major changes in remaining apartheid
laws as part of his plan for a new constitution that would include
blacks for the first time.
   He reiterated plans for parliament to repeal this year the
Separate Amenities Act, which allows for the segregation of public
facilities such as swimming pools, buses and libraries.
   De Klerk also pledged major changes in three other apartheid
laws, including the Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods
by race; the Population Registration Act, which classifies all
citizens by race; and the Land Acts, which confine the black
majority to 13 percent of the country's land.

<HEAD>Albania Wants Renewed U.S., Soviet Ties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Albania, Eastern Europe's
last hard-line Communist state, has said he wants to restore ties
with the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Communist leader Ramiz Alia also outlined economic reforms to
increase production and improve supplies, including some private
farming. However, he rejected any notion of following the reforms
that have ended Communist rule in most Soviet bloc countries.
   Alia spoke at the closing session of a Communist Central
Committee meeting Tuesday. An English translation was provided by
the state ATA news agency Thursday.
   ``We have wanted, and want, friendly relations with all the
countries, irrespective of their social system,'' Alia said.
   ``The problem of the re-establishment of the diplomatic
relations with the United States of America and the Soviet Union is
on the agenda,'' Alia was quoted by ATA as saying.
   Although the United States and the Soviet Union have offered
diplomatic relations in the past, Alia charged that Moscow and
Washington were responsible for the lack of ties.
   He said Albania was also interested in relations with Britain.
   Since becoming party leader in April 1985, Alia has pursued a
policy of slowly opening the country, establishing diplomatic
relations with dozens of countries.
   Albania, a country of more than 3 million, is considered the
last bastion of Stalinism. It broke with the Soviet Union in 1961
over Moscow's policy of de-Stalinization and with China in 1978
because of Beijing's perceived deviation from Marxist-Leninist
tenets.
   In his speech, Alia said Albania also is interested in
establishing diplomatic ties with the European Common Market.
   The Communist leader said Albania's economic reforms would in
some cases link wages to production, force some companies to become
self-supporting and allow prices at least partially to be
determined by the market.
   Alia said that in an effort to increase the food supply,
peasants working on cooperative farms could decide for themselves
whether they prefer to work individual plots.

<HEAD>Inmate Testifies White Youth Confessed to Killing Black Teen-ager</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A longtime convict claimed in court that a
19-year-old man who is on trial in the murder of a black teen-ager
confessed he was the triggerman.
   Charles Brown, 32, a self-styled jailhouse lawyer, testified
Thursday that Joseph Fama confessed to the slaying of Yusuf
Hawkins, 16, when they shared a cell at the Brooklyn House of
Detention the night of March 22.
   ``I shot him, I shot him,'' Brown quoted Fama as saying. ``I
can't bring the guy back.''
   Brown testified that Fama hoped to get off by pleading insanity.
   ``My lawyer's going to take care of it. I'm going to plead
insanity,'' Brown quoted Fama as saying. ``I'm going to play like
I'm crazy and don't know what happened.''
   Fama is on trial with Keith Mondello, 19. Both were charged with
murder and face 25 years to life if convicted, Fama as the alleged
triggerman and Mondello as the alleged mastermind behind a mostly
white mob that left the black teen-ager dead in Brooklyn's
Bensonhurst section.
   Brown testified that he passed on the information about Fama to
repay a favor to a prosecutor. The favor was not explained in court.
   Hawkins and three of his friends, all black, were accosted by
the mob of bat-wielding youths last Aug. 23 when they went to
mostly white Bensonhurst to look at a used car.
   Last October, Brown testified for Brooklyn prosecutors in
another case, telling jurors that an inmate at Rikers Island, Frank
DeChirico, confessed to him that he had shot a young art student
during a mugging in September 1988. DeChirico was convicted of
murdering Judith Anne Wrappe.
   In the Bensonhurst trial, Phyllis D'Agata testified Thursday
that she was looking out a window of her second-floor apartment
when she saw Mondello walk by with a bat and what appeared to be a
gun shortly before Hawkins was slain.
   ``Inside his waistband, I saw a gun,'' Ms. D'Agata said. ``I
didn't exactly see a gun. I saw an outline of a gun.''
   Defense lawyers blame Mrs. D'Agata's daughter, Gina Feliciano,
for the attack, saying she invited a group of her black and
Hispanic friends to attend her 18th birthday party at her apartment.
   The mob mistook Hawkins and his pals for Miss Feliciano's
friends and considered them to be troublemakers, defense lawyers
say.
   Opening arguments began this week after two weeks of jury
selection.
   Testimony was to continue today.

   The dollar was higher against most major
currencies in European trading this morning but was weaker against
the Japanese yen.
   Gold was higher in light trading.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen
from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar fetched 157.50
yen.
   ``The dollar was bought in the afternoon session for position
adjustments with the approach of the weekend,'' said Norio Takeda,

trigger selling or buying for profit taking, loss cutting or
technical adjustment.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:

<HEAD>Five Killed in Beirut Battles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militiamen vying for
leadership of the country's largest religious sect battled
overnight in west Beirut, and Christian forces clashed in the
city's eastern sector, police said today.
   They said five people were killed and 12 wounded in the Shiite
violence, which also engulfed Iqlim el-Tuffah, or the Apple
Province, above the southern port city of Sidon.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 23 killed and
83 wounded since fighting between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for hope, broke
out Monday.
   Fighting in the Moslem sector of Beirut eased after Syrian
soldiers moved in and separated the combatants before dawn. But
fierce battles raged in the south, police said.
   The two factions have been fighting intermittently for two years
for dominance of the 1.2 million-member Shiite community, the
largest of Lebanon's 17 sects. By police count, about 1,000 people
were killed and 3,000 wounded in previous Amal-Hezbollah clashes.
   Police also said four people were wounded in intermittent
skirmishes in east Beirut between troops loyal to rebel Gen. Michel
Aoun and the Lebanese Forces Christian militia.
   The inter-Christian showdown started Jan. 30 in Lebanon's
310-square-mile Christian enclave, which includes east Beirut and
the surrounding hinterlands.
   That fighting has killed 893 people and wounded 2,392. It has
forced about 400,000 of the enclave's 1 million residents to flee.
   Schools across Beirut, displaying rare unity, observed a daylong
strike today to protest an attack on a school bus in which 11
children were burned to death. Three teachers and the bus driver
also were killed in Wednesday's attack, and 10 others were wounded.
   The bus was carrying the children across the city's
Christian-Moslem Green Line when it was hit in the Christian sector
by an incendiary rifle grenade and caught fire.
   Aoun's command blamed the attack on the Lebanese Forces militia.
The militia command blamed Aoun's troops.

   Discord prevails in a planned name-change
for an organization of women barbershop singers that no longer
wants to be known as Sweet Adelines Inc.
   The group, which claims 30,000 members in a dozen countries,
wants to be called Harmony International Corp., but an unrelated
harmony group called Harmony Inc. has filed a lawsuit seeking to
halt the change, saying the names would be too similar.
   The lawsuit, filed April 13 in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee,
wants a judge to order the Sweet Adelines to remove a sign boasting
the new name in front of its Tulsa headquarters.
   Officials of the Sweet Adelines say a trademark search was
conducted after the board of directors voted for the name change in
June 1989. Its application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office is pending.
   Sharon Green, director of accounting at the Sweet Adelines'
Tulsa office, said the group plans to pursue the name change.
   ``We feel like we're on fairly solid ground,'' Ms. Green said.
   The Sweet Adelines' lawyer, Joe Fulton, said the sign will not
be changed unless a judge orders it changed.
   Sweet Adelines claims 651 chapters in countries that include New
Zealand, Japan and Canada.
   The group was founded in 1945 for women who wanted to experience
the bliss of barbershop harmony.
   Last month, Jorja Jacobs, communications director for the Sweet
Adelines, said the group has come a long way since its founding and
the adoption of the name from Harry Armstrong's 1903 song, ``You're
the Flower of My Heart, Sweet Adeline.''
   ``Some people don't think Sweet Adelines indicates what our
organization is about,'' Ms. Jacobs said.

   Prosecutors plan to seek indictments against
four male students at St. John's University in the alleged sexual
assault of a female student, a published report said.
   As many as three of the four students are members of the
university's lacrosse team, New York Newsday reported today.
   The incident reportedly occurred March 1 at a house near the
university in the borough of Queens, where the woman had gone with
another student.
   Though her story varied, the woman basically said she had oral
sex with the one student, and that several others sodomized her
while others looked on, according to Newsday and the New York Post.
   At one point, the woman told authorities she heard the men
saying, ``Let's get the video cameras and the condoms,'' but
another student stepped in and stopped them. The woman reported the
incident to the university on March 9 and the university notified
police March 30.

   A murderer scheduled for execution
Saturday has ordered a halt to his appeals after spending half his
life behind bars, saying he wants to ``get it ver with.''
   Jerome Butler, whose age is listed in prison records as 54 but
claims to be several years older, has been on death row since
November 1986 for the robbery and murder that June of a Houston
taxi driver.
   Since last month, when his first execution date was set, Butler
has refused to let lawyers file motions that could spare him from
lethal injection.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Butler said at that time.
``They could take these cuffs off me and walk me back to (death
row) and I still won't resist. There won't be no appeals.''
   Bob Walt, an assistant attorney general, said Thursday that
Butler did not appear to be backing down.
   Vic Pecorino, one of Butler's lawyers, said he had no plans to
go ahead with legal efforts to spare Butler's life against his
wishes.
   ``I think it's pretty clear and I don't think it's up to us to
go ahead'' with appeals, Pecorino said.
   Butler, convicted of shooting Nathan Oakley, has been in and out
of prison since 1959.
   Butler would be the 34th inmate executed in Texas and the 122nd
nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states
to resume use of the death penalty. The last execution in Texas was
Dec. 7.

   A Shiite Moslem leader reputed to have
influence with kidnappers holding three Americans said today the
release of one captive is certain despite a ``cowboy mentality'' on
the part of the United States.
   Hussein Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian wing within the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a telephone
interview: ``The delay is certain, the complications are certain,
but the release is also certain.''
   On Thursday, pro-Iranian kidnappers said they would postpone
indefinitely freeing an American hostage.
   Musawi said the delay was caused by Washington's rejection of
the kidnappers' key demand _ that Assistant Secretary of State for
the Near East John Kelly fly to Damascus, Syria, to finalize the
release.
   ``But Kelly's failure to respond is not going to cancel the
release. The hostage might be released in another manner, maybe
dialogue. I cannot speculate further. I can't lie,'' Musawi said.
   Asked when he expected the release to take place, he said:
``That depends on how farsighted the Americans might become. So
far, their behavior is arrogant and one of cowboy mentalty.''
   ``If someone decides to return a hostage, the other side is
supposed to take the hostage,'' Musawi said.
   Syria said late Thursday that it was working to secure the
release of a hostage by this weekend.
   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, or Islamic hope, a faction within
Hezbollah that advocates strong links with Syria.
   He is believed to be the mentor of the underground Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine. The group holds professors Alann
Steen, a native of Boston, who turns 51 on Sunday; Jesse Turner,
42, of Boise, Idaho; and Robert Polhill, 55, of New York.
   The three were kidnapped from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated
Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987, by gunmen posing as
riot police.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said Wednesday
it would free a hostage by this evening if the United States met
its conditions.
   But it announced Thursday that it was postponing its plans after
the United States refused to dispatch Kelly.
   President Bush said: ``The United States does not knuckle under
to demands.''
   As ambassador to Lebanon during the Reagan administration, Kelly
was involved in secret discussions with the White House on
negotiations for the release of American hostages in return for
arms sales to Iran. Kelly now is U.S. assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern affairs.
   Peggy Say, the sister of American hostage Terry Anderson, said
she was ``totally puzzled by the attitude of reluctance to move
forward and get on with this. If they want John Kelly, send them
John Kelly.''
   M.T. Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committee
in New York, said in a statement that the United States ``fumbled''
an opportunity to help gain freedom for a hostage.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa expressed optimism late
Thursday, however. He said his government had ``been exerting a
great deal of influence'' to secure a release by Sunday. He would
not elaborate.
   He spoke amid a series of meetings with the U.S. ambassador to
Syria, Edward Djerejian. Djerejian, who had been at a diplomatic
meeting in West Germany with Kelly, flew to Damascus Thursday. He
did not speak with reporters.
   Syria and Iran have urged kidnappers to end the hostage crisis
and free the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon.
   The announcement by the kidnappers that they would release one
captive implied some sort of exchange was involved, and the
communique was accompanied by an instant photograph of Turner, the
first of him alone since three months after his abduction.
   The statement announcing the postponement was accompanied by an
instant photograph of Polhill.
   The group also renewed threats to attack jetliners and airports
used to transport thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrants to Israel.
   Much of the 500-word statement released Thursday was devoted to
the rising number of Jewish emigrants, who Arab leaders say could
strengthen Israel and displace Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   ``As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and
finalized,'' the statement said.
   ``But Kelly's failure to respond has so far frustrated the
release, which made us postpone this operation until the picture is
cleared,'' it said.
   A senior U.S. official said Kelly's participation would have
engaged the United States in hostage negotiations or at least given
that appearance.
   The release would have been the first of an American since David
Jacobsen, director of the American University hospital, was freed
on Nov. 2, 1986, after more than 17 months in captivity.
   Eight Americans are among the Western hostages held in Lebanon
by pro-Iranian groups. The longest-held is Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.

   A court today rejected an appeal for political
asylum from a Chinese man accused of hijacking a Chinese airliner
to Japan, lawyers said.
   If a final appeal to the justice minister fails, Zhang Zhenhai,
36, of China's Hebei province, will be extradited to China and
could face execution, one of his lawyers said after the Tokyo High
Court's decision was announced.
   In a statement released through his lawyers in January, Zhang
said the hijacking was a last-ditch attempt to flee political
persecution following his involvement in pro-democracy protests in
Beijing last spring. Chinese authorities crushed the student-led
protests in Beijing's Tiananmen square.
   Police said Zhang hijacked the plane on Dec. 16, threatening to
blow it up with a bomb he did not actually have. The Boeing 747, on
a flight from Beijing to New York with 233 people aboard, flew to
Fukuoka in southwestern Japan after South Korea refused to let it
land there.
   After landing, Zhang was shoved out of the plane by a crew
member and hospitalized with a broken pelvis. The plane was
returned to China on Dec. 17 with 208 passengers on board,
including Zhang's wife and 13-year-old son.
   Yaeko Takeoka, one of three Japanese lawyers representing Zhang,
said she was ``shocked that despite the evidence that Mr. Zhang was
actively involved in the Tiananmen protests, they ruled against
him.''
   A pro-democracy activist, Yue Wu, testified during the trial
that he had met Zhang three times in Beijing during the protests.
Yue escaped China after the crackdown and was granted asylum in
France.
   Prosecutors maintained, however, that Zhang was not involved in
anti-government activities and that he hijacked the aircraft to
escape criminal charges in China and seek work in Japan.
   China demanded that Zhang, who has been in police custody since
Dec. 31., be returned to stand trial.
   China's state-run television has carried reports on the
hijacking that said Zhang had been arrested in October on charges
of embezzling from a factory.
   Chinese authorities have executed hijackers in the past.
   Ms. Takeoka said Zhang's lawyers were filing an appeal to the
justice minister. However, she said she thought it would be
difficult to overturn the decision on his extradition.
   Zhang's Japanese lawyers also said today's decision indicated
the Japanese legal system was still slow in recognizing human
rights.
   The Japan branch of the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International said in a statement it was ``deeply concerned'' about
the court's decision. It made an appeal to Justice Minister Shin
Hasegawa.
   A Foreign Ministry official, however, defended the decision.
   Zhang ``should be tried for the hijacking. There is no evidence
suggesting that he is a political refugee,'' ministry spokesman
Taizo Watanabe said.

<HEAD>Shops Close for Ramadan Strike in Occupied Lands</HEAD>

   Shops and offices were closed in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip today in a strike called by Islamic fundamentalists
who lead the uprising against the Israeli occupation.
   PLO-backed leaders of the Palestinian uprising also called for
new tactics in the 28-month-old revolt, including using general
strikes as ``confrontation days with Israeli authorities.''
   ``Confrontation days'' typically include increased
stone-throwing, blocking roads, slogan writing and anti-Israeli
demonstrations.
   In the past, most Palestinians have stayed home during strikes,
often making them calmer than other days in the occupied
territories.
   During today's strike, which coincided with the final Friday of
the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, the Islamic fundamentalist
movement Hamas, or Zeal, allowed taxis and buses to operate so they
could carry Moslems to prayer services. The strike also closed
businesses in Arab east Jerusalem.
   The call for ``tactical changes'' in the revolt against Israeli
occupation came in a leaflet issued Thursday by the Unified
Leadership of the Uprising.
   Among the new tactics is a call for Palestinians to turn out
their lights for 15 minutes on May 5 to protest the continued
closure of Palestinian universities. On April 28, drivers were
asked to halt their vehicles and honk their horns for five minutes
to show solidarity with Arabs deported by Israel.
   New modes of protest had been demanded by the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which accused the united
leadership of complacency and threatened to break away. The Marxist
front and other factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which back the leadership, issued a joint statement earlier this
week promising a change in tactics.
   The latest leaflet also called for new controls in dealing with
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   At least 207 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs since
the start of the uprising, most on suspicion of informing on
uprising activists. The leaflet said collaborators should be
ostracized socially but there should be no killings without
``special orders issued by high-ranking circles.''
   Aside from the collaborator deaths, Israeli soldiers or
civilians have killed 674 Palestinians in the uprising, and 43
Israelis have died.

   Lech Walesa won an overwhelming vote of
confidence from Solidarity at the union's second national congress
today after delivering an impassioned defense of his 10 years as
the movement's leader.
   On the congress' second day and just 24 hours before an expected
re-election bid, Walesa asked for a show of support. Delegates
present responded with a vote of 357 in favor, one against and 22
abstentions.
   Walesa's earlier impromptu address highlighted internal tensions
in the movement that weathered repression and toppled the Communist
government since it last met as a whole in 1981.
   ``The victory I am giving to you, the mistakes are ours ... But
all the mistakes we made, you should correct here and today,'' he
said..
   ``I did this only for Poland, not for myself ... It was our
mutual victory ... I was only the driver.''
   Walesa, still immensely important in Poland despite some
slippage in popularity polls, accepted the vote of confidence with
his arms extended in the traditional Solidarity V for victory.
   The crowd chanted the fond diminutive of his first name:
``Lechu, Lechu, Lechu.''
   Walesa is to run for re-election as union chairman Saturday. He
was likely to retain control of Solidarity as it struggles to
decide how much of a union and how much of a political force it
will be in post-Communist Poland.
   Parliament member Andrzej Malachowski appealed to fellow
delegates to end intrigue saying, ``Stop it, please. Lech Walesa
has well served the fatherland.''
   Walesa called for the confidence vote in a second speech after
delegates criticized his morning address. One delegate said it had
served ``only to raise the temperature of emotions.''
   The scheduled six-day meeting is being held in the same Olivia
sports hall where the union met for 18 stormy days in the autumn of
1981.
   Communist authorities declared military rule to crush Solidarity
only two months later, forcing the union into an eight-year battle
to regain legal status and worker rights.
   Recalling how he led Solidarity's founding during a 1980 Gdansk
shipyard strike, Walesa said today: ``It was just my luck that I
jumped over the shipyard fence. But you liked my jump and that is
why you chose me to lead this vehicle called Solidarity.''
   ``From the begining ... Driving this vehicle was very hard,'' he
said. ``Today, after 10 years of experience we still have trouble.''
   Several times during the speech he acknowledged making mistakes.
   ``I thank all who worked together with me and against me. I
apologize to all those I offended,'' he concluded.
   Before Walesa's speech, the congress voted to admit as
non-voting guests all members of the 1981 union leadership not
among the 487 elected delegates. Included were several who have
broken with the mainstream of Solidarity.
   In the past, some accused Walesa of undemocratic rule. Others
opposed any compromise with the former Communist government,
including the negotiations that led to June's partly free elections
and last fall's installation of the first non-Communist government
in the East bloc.
   Walesa threatened to leave the hall if certain members of the
former leadership showed up, although he did not specify who he
meant.
   ``I will leave this meeting for all the offense, for distruction
of the union, for talking about losing (ideals). I will not sit
with those gentlemen at the same table,'' he said, to applause from
the hall.
   Walesa then declined to offer the scheduled report on the
union's activities since the last congress, and turned the
microphone over to someone ``not so emotionally linked,'' Janusz
Palubicki, a longtime Solidarity leader.
   Palubicki recounted the battle to preserve Solidarity amid
jailings of its leaders and thousands of supporters, confiscation
of equipment and public attacks by Communist authorities.
   Even as it faces deep questions about its future, Solidarity
launched the congress Thursday celebrating its triumphs. Present
for the first day was Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, once
imprisoned for his Solidarity activism.
   The union regained legal status only on April 17, 1989, then
after the June elections took control of the government.
   But Solidarity has managed to sign up only 2.2 million of the 10
million members it had in 1981. Opinion polls show confidence
dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships associated with
the strict austerity program being pursued by the
Solidarity-created government.
   Economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising
unemployment among the industrial workers who comprise the backbone
of Solidarity.
   The delegates are expected to debate how much they want
Solidarity to be confined to union issues, decide whether to create
a Solidarity-linked political party and draw up a union program
before the congress closes Tuesday.

   A group hunting Nazi war criminals said today
it will give the United States, West Germany and Australia the
names of 223 Lithuanians and Poles believed to have taken part in
the murder of nearly 200,000 Jews in World War II.
   Efraim Zuroff, Israel director of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, said the names were among 1,284 mentioned in
documents given last year by Leibl Kunichowsky, an elderly
Holocaust suvivor who now lives in Sunrise, Fla., to the archives
of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.
   Kunichowsky, a civil engineer who lived in Kaunas, Lithuania,
went from refugee camp to refugee camp in 1945-49, taking testimony
from survivors. Each statement was signed and witnessed.
   Unlike other areas of Europe, where Jews died mainly in Nazi gas
chambers, the interviews show that many of the Jews in Lithuania
were shot by local partisans, Zuroff said.
   ``They weren't deported to death camps,'' he said. ``They were
murdered locally, and the collaborators played an extremely
significant role, often carrying out the killing themselves.''
   The lists name Nazi collaborators suspected of taking part in
the murder of nearly 200,000 Jews, he said.
   So far, Zuroff said, researchers have carefully examined only
half of Kunichowsky's list. He said there was a chance of
prosecuting only about one-third of the suspects because many have
died, others are too old to stand trial, and some cannot be traced
because full names and other details are missing.
   ``What we will be able to achieve (in bringing some to trial) is
only symbolic justice which will serve as a warning to the
murderers of tomorrow,'' he said.
   Zuroff said the names of 38 prime suspects will be sent to the
U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations next
week. The names of 130 other suspected collaborators will be turned
over to the West German Embassy and 55 will be given to the
Australian Embassy on Monday.
   Other lists of names will be sent soon to Canada and England.
   Kunichowsky had kept his material in hopes of writing a book,
but he turned the documents over to Yad Vashem last year.
   The Weisenthal center researchers cross-checked the names with
other records at Yad Vashem and files from an International Red
Cross tracing service in West Germany. Some of those listed were
already known as war crimes suspects, but most were new, Zuroff
said.
   He said the names would not be made public so as not to tip off
the suspects and because in some cases further investigation is
needed to establish identity.
   The 1,683 pages of testimony were taken in Yiddish, the
day-to-day language of many European Jews, and contain graphic
accounts of the terror faced by 171 Jewish communities that were
uprooted.

   Bugs Bunny, Alf and the Slimer share an honor
usually reserved for the president: They're appearing
simultaneously on NBC, CBS and ABC. Four cable networks also will
show the Toon talk at the same time.
   The TV program granted these State-of-the-Unionlike privileges
is titled ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue,'' a half-hour special
warning youngsters about drug and alcohol abuse.
   In what participants call an unprecedented show of industry
cooperation, the networks, cable channels and more than 200
independent stations will show the program Saturday morning.
   ``They want to be able to reach every single kid who watches
television, and we know from experience with kids that the way to
grab their attention is to use characters they know to convey a
story and a message,'' said Phyllis Tucker Vinson, NBC vice
president for children's programming.
   The participating cable networks are Black Entertainment
Television, the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and the USA Network.
Ted Turner's TBS and TNT cable networks, and Lifetime also will run
the program, but at different times.
   ``All-Stars,'' which will have no commercials, tells the story
of Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is saved with help from
Bugs Bunny, Garfield, the Chipmunks, Alf, Slimer, and other cartoon
characters familiar to children.
   George C. Scott provides the voice of Smoke, a sinister,
drug-pushing apparition.
   The program, financed with nearly $2 million from McDonald's
Corp. and its charities, was produced under the auspices of the Los
Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts and Science.
   In a speech in Los Angeles last month, President Bush praised
the show and said that ``the days when popular culture glorified
and glamorized drug use are fading fast.''
   A 15-minute preview Thursday in Washington won applause from
members of Congress _ with a hint of skepticism.
   ``I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion
activity in which we finally hear from Hollywood and this is the
final shot,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. ``Showing this once
or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's going to
use drugs.''
   Vinson, in a phone interview from her NBC office in Burbank,
Calif., said there have been no discussions yet for further
programs.
   ``We have not talked about it,'' she said. ``I think it will
depend on what the reaction to this show is. But of course, there
are other subjects that we could get involved in.''
   Vinson, who has four children and expects her fifth next month,
said she plans to watch the cartoon with her two oldest children
``and then I'll talk about it with them. I hope a lot of parents do
that.''
   Because the show is unsponsored, it won't be rated by the A.C.
Nielsen Co., she said. ``I wish it were, so that we could tell how
many kids were watching,'' she said.
   The show's Saturday air times in the different time zones are
10:30 a.m. EDT, 9:30 a.m. CDT, 8:30 a.m. MDT, and 9:30 a.m. PDT,
according to the academy.

   Gov. Roy Romer urged a gun club to call off
a prairie dog shooting contest that has drawn protest from animal
rights groups.
   Romer said he lacks the power to stop the July 14-15 event,
billed as the ``Top Dog World Championship Prairie Dog Shoot,'' but
argued that ``it is wrong to make a spectacle of the killing of
prairie dogs.''
   Participants will compete in 50 two-member teams and attempt to
kill the most praire dogs at the greatest distrance. The contest is
to take place on private farms and ranches around Naturita and
Nucla, two hamlets in western Colorado about 100 miles south of
Grand Junction, organizers said.
   Hours before the governor made his announcement Thursday, U.S.
Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., accused him of dodging the
controversy. Romer had said Wednesday he wouldn't try to stop the
event because it is a local issue.
   ``To think people would turn it into a bloody circus is
macabre,'' said Campbell from Washington. ``I know it's an election
year, but Roy should think about this again. This is something he
should take a stand on.''
   Stan Austin, one of the organizers, said of Romer's stance,
``Well, those things happen. We realize there are people on both
sides of this issue.''
   Austin said he doesn't understand how the contest could be
regarded as a circus. ``It's a group of sportsmen competing,'' he
said. ``I believe it's more humane to kill them with a rifle than
poison.''
   Residents of the area complain that prairie dogs multiply
rapidly and create burrows in which cattle can break their legs.
They also damage irrigation systems in a state where water is at a
premium. Wide poisoning is banned by the federal government because
the poison can be picked up by eagles and other predators of
prairie dogs.
   An animal rights activist said the contest is promoting
``killing for killing's sake.''
   ``I'm a vegetarian, but I have respect for people who eat what
they kill,'' said Robin Duxbury, president of the Rocky Mountain
Humane Society. ``But these people aren't hunting for any reason. I
don't know anyone who eats prairie dog stew.''

   The process of shipping damaged nuclear
fuel from the Three Mile Island reactor to the U.S. Energy
Department's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory is completed.
   Officials at TMI said the final shipment, 20 canisters packed in
three specially designed rail shipping casks, arrived at the
laboratory Thursday.
   Since July 1986, 300,000 pounds of fuel and debris were shipped
by rail from TMI to Idaho Falls in 22 trips. The operation cost the
plant operator, GPU Nuclear Corp., $23 million, said spokeswoman
Mary Wells.
   Scientists at the laboratory are studying the fuel to better
understand the effects of the March 1979 accident at Three Mile
Island, in which a combination of mechanical and operator errors
allowed the radioactive core to overheat and partially melt.
   Workers are continuing to decontaminate the plant, and GPU
Nuclear and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission are working on
details of putting it into long-term monitored storage.

<TEXT>
   The crew of the USS Iowa lined the rails of
the battleship as families of the 47 sailor killed in a gun turret
explosion came together on the anniversary of the tragedy.
   More than 300 family members attended Thursday's memorial
service aboard the World War II battleship at the Norfolk Naval
Base. The ceremony ended with the dedication of a plaque mounted on
gun turret No. 2, where the explosion occurred.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally, commander of the Iowa, praised the
families for their support.
   ``There are many of the families of our fallen shipmates
themselves, who realized that the crew was as much a victim as they
were, and who, despite their own personal sacrifice, lovingly
offered their own special support and encouragement,'' he said.
   The memorial service to mark the April 19, 1989, explosion was
private but the Navy released copies of remarks. Among those
attending was Kathy Kubicina, sister of the Iowa sailor accused by
the Navy of causing the blast.
   Seven weeks after the explosion in gun turret No. 2, the Iowa
left for six months in the Mediterranean, and Moosally said he and
the crew were encouraged by the letters from the families.
   ``They lifted us up when we were down. They gave us
understanding when we were being categorized in neat little sound
bites. They helped us feel that we were not alone,'' he said.
   Likewise, the crew has remembered the families.
   Robert Jones of Newport News, whose son Brian died in the
explosion, spoke before the ceremony of four Iowa sailors who drove
all night from Norfolk to be at his son's burial in Kennesaw, Ga.
   ``Today, the loss of my son hangs deep within me, just as I know
it does in the hearts of the 46 other families who lost their
sons,'' Jones said. ``But when I am feeling low, I think of those
four Iowa sailors, my son's shipmates, and what they did for us on
that sad day almost a year ago.
   ``It is a memory that will remain with me forever,'' he said.
   Questions still remain about the explosion during gunnery
exercises off the coast of Puerto Rico. A five-month Navy
investigation concluded the explosion was sabotage by Gunner's Mate
Clayton Hartwig, who died in the blast.
   A subcommittee of the House Armed Services committee held
hearings and found the Navy's conclusion was not supported by the
facts. Hartwig's sister and other families are trying to get the
investigation reopened.
   Kreig Brusnahan, an attorney representing the Hartwigs and two
other families, said his clients are considering suing the Navy.
   Some of the families are trying to get the Navy to donate the
battleship for a museum. The ship is expected to be retired later
this year.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the ship belongs to us,'' said John
Hague of La Mesa, N.M., whose stepson, Lt. j.g. Philip Buch, died
in the explosion.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization today
appealed for an emergency Arab summit to discuss the emigration of
Soviet Jews to Israel and what it called Western threats against
Iraq.
   Azzam al-Ahmed, the PLO's representative in Baghdad, told The
Associated Press that the 15-man Executive Committee met in an
overnight session under chairman Yasser Arafat.
   He said the committee agreed that an emergency Arab summit was
necessary ``to confront the influx of Soviet Jews, Israeli threats
against Iraq and to esclate the Intefadeh,'' or Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation which has raged since December
1987.
   Western reports have suggested that Iraq is trying to build
nuclear weapons. Iraq and other Arab countries said the reports
were part of a campaign aimed at preparing international public
opinion for an attack on Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Arafat and the PLO officials
supported Iraq's threat last week to use chemical weapons against
Israel if it is attacked by Israel.
   The news agency quoted Arafat as calling the warning ``an
assurance of a long-awaited Arab deterence in the face of Israeli
arrogance and American hegemony.''
   The Executive Committee authorized Arafat to contact Arab
leaders on the need to convene the emergency Arab summit soon.
   Arafat arrived on Thursday from Amman, Jordan, where he
discussed with King Hussein the Arab summit issue. He is expected
to fly to Saudi Arabia on Saturday for similar talks with King Fahd.
   Arabs fear that thousands of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel
will settle in the occupied territories captured from Israel's Arab
neighbors. They fear that the influx will lead to a forced exodus
of Palestinians to Jordan.

<TEXT>
   The head of East Germany's former Communist
Party today criticized the new government's plan for unification
and said it would allow the country to be colonized by West Germany.
   Gregor Gysi, a respected lawyer who took over the battered
Communist Party after its hard-line leaders were ousted last year,
said both Germanys should instead work together to build a new
nation.
   In Bonn, a spokesman for the West German government said the
Soviet Union also has expressed misgivings about the quick
unification that both Germanys favor.
   Lawmakers today debated the unification plans of the coalition
government led by Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, whose Cabinet
includes most of the major political factions in Parliament.
   There was wide support for much of de Maiziere's plans for a
fast unification, but some opposition lawmakers said it gives East
Germany too little say in creating a unified Germany.
   Gysi told fellow members of Parliament that East Germans must
have a chance to ``go upright into unification.''
   Gysi leads a reformed Communist Party now called the Party for
Social Democracy, which finished third in East Germany's first free
elections on March 18.
   His delegation walked out of the session after a member of the
arch-conservative German Social Union, Joachim Hubertus Nowack,
linked the new Communists to the former hard-line regime and
compared that government to the Nazi dictatorship preceding it.
   Earlier, Gysi criticized the method under which East Germany
would merely adopt the constitution of West Germany.
   He backed instead a much slower form of unification under which
the constitutions of both nations would be abolished and new laws
written for a united Germany.
   The present form backed by the de Maiziere government would
amount to little more than annexation and ``colonization,'' Gysi
said.
   But Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl denounced a slower process
and said the nation should brook ``no more socialist experiments.''
   Wolfgang Thierse of the left-leaning Social Democrats, who have
joined de Maiziere's government, said the quicker process is ``the
realistic way'' to unity.
   East Germany's economy is in shambles and, in the March
elections voters overwhelmingly backed leaders advocating quick
unification with the wealthy West.
   West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel confirmed reports
Bonn had received a message from Moscow expressing misgivings about
quick unification of the Germanys.
   West German media also reported last week that Kremlin officials
had contacted de Maiziere and told him they opposed the quick
method because it would allow East Germany to be integrated into
NATO. East Germany now is in the Warsaw Pact.
   Also today, the head of the Department of Defense and
Disarmament, Rainer Eppelmann, was quoted as saying he favors
reducing the East German army from 135,000 members to about 50,000
and later eliminating the force entirely.
   Eppelmann spoke to the Express newspaper in Cologne, West
Germany.

   The son and future daughter-in-law of reputed
mob boss John Gotti have applied for a marriage license for their
wedding, according to New York Newsday.
   The next member of the Gotti clan is Kim Albanese, of whom
little is known except that she lives on Long Island, according to
today's editions of Newsday and the New York Post.
   She's tying the knot with John A. Gotti, son of the ``Teflon
Don.'' The two went to Queens Borough Hall on Thursday to apply for
the license, Newsday said.
   Law enforcement officials have alleged that the younger Gotti
joined the mob last year. He is 26 and is said to be president of a
Brooklyn trucking company; he has been arrested several times in
bar fights.
   His father is reputedly head of the Gambino organization, which
authorities say is the nation's most powerful crime family.
   The plans for Saturday's wedding remain shrouded in secrecy. The
Daily News reported previously that nuptials at Our Lady of Grace
Roman Catholic Church in Howard Beach would be followed by a
reception for 200 people at the Helmsley Palace Hotel in Manhattan.
   ``I am not going to comment about any wedding plans that may or
may not be upcoming,'' said attorney Bruce Cutler, who represents
Gotti's father.
   ``I have nothing to say. No dice,'' said the pastor of Our Lady
of Grace Church.

   The wife of a hemophiliac with AIDS became
infected with the deadly virus after undergoing artificial
insemination in an effort to conceive a child, officials say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said fertility
specialists had attempted to remove the virus from the husband's
sperm through separation and filtration, but the woman tested
positive for the virus in January after inseminations last August,
October and December. She did not get pregnant.
   How the woman became infected with AIDS can never be proven, but
the couple was using condoms during sex and did not engage in oral
or anal sex, which are high AIDS-risk behaviors, the CDC said
Thursday.
   The husband, a hemophilia patient, had tested positive for AIDS
infection since 1985; many hemophilia patients became infected in
the first years of the AIDS epidemic through contaminated
blood-clotting products.
   ``There are thousands of couples in this situation, and many of
them are actively seeking some way of inseminating safely,'' Dr.
Scott Holmberg, the CDC's chief of special AIDS studies, said
Thursday.
   ``But there are clear CDC recommendations against doing this,
and many physicians have continually counseled such couples not to
run this risk,'' he said.
   The CDC said AIDS is transmitted through blood and semen, and
``there is no evidence that any procedure can reliably eliminate
HIV from semen.''
   The couple's identity was not disclosed.
   The CDC has received reports of at least two other couples who
have tried artificial insemination despite one spouse's infection.
One attempt resulted in pregnancy, and the other did not; no
infection has been detected yet in the non-infected spouse.
   ``The outcome of doing this very risky procedure is by no means
assured,'' Holmberg said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Estonia's foreign minister said today
his Baltic republic rejects Soviet threats and inducements and
refuses to rescind a declaration proclaiming itself an occupied,
independent state.
   Lennart Meri told Finnish national radio that Estonia would
ignore Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threat on Thursday
to impose economic reprisals unless the Estonians repealed the
decision.
   In a carrot-and-stick approach, Gorbachev also offered ``special
status'' within a Soviet confederation if Estonia abandoned its
path toward independence.
   The Kremlin has imposed an oil and gas embargo on Estonia's
Baltic neighbor, Lithuania, for refusing to rescind laws promoting
independence.
   ``Gorbachev really should know that if a nation has elected its
own parliament and that parliament has declared in the name of the
people that Estonia is an occupied independent republic, then it is
impossible for our parliament to repeal such a law,'' said Meri,
who is on a previously unpublicized visit to Finland.
   ``We cannot elect ourselves a new nation,'' he added.
   Unlike Lithuania, Estonia did not declare independence but
passed a resolution March 30 stating that it is a sovereign but
occupied state that was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in
1940.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia
in 1940 as part of a secret agreement between Josef Stalin and
Adolf Hitler.
   Meri said Estonia would not continue negotiations with Moscow as
long as Soviet authorities refused to recognize the declaration by
the 105-member Estonian Supreme Soviet.
   Meri said Estonia's foreign policy is based on the 1920 Tarto
peace treaty, in which the Soviet Union recognized Estonia as an
independent republic.

<HEAD>Report: Prisoners Held 5 Years Without Trial In Israeli Prison,
Tortured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some inmates at a prison run by an Israeli-backed
militia in southern Lebanon have been tortured and held as many as
five years without trial, a British newspaper reported today.
   The Independent said some prisoners have spent months in total
darkness and solitary confinement at the prison on a hilltop above
the Christian village of Khiam in Israel's security zone.
   Israel set up the prison during its 1982-5 invasion of Lebanon.
It is now run by the South Lebanon Army, which is trained and
financed by Israel.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman declined to comment on
the report.
   ``We do not deal with Khiam,'' he said. ``It is under the SLA.
We do not represent the SLA.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity
according to military rules.
   The Independent quoted unidentified former prisoners as saying
suspected guerrillas held there had been tortured by having
electric wires attached to their bodies, and that some had received
savage beatings.
   The story named one present inmate as Selma Salam, 23, an
interpreter for the United Nation's Norwegian battalion in southern
Lebanon. It said three gunmen in plain clothes took her away in a
car from her home at the Shia Moslem village of Blat last July 11.
   It said her mother has not been allowed to visit her and her
U.N. employers had sought in vain for information about her from
the Israelis and from the South Lebanon Army.
   The Independent said neither the International Red Cross, nor
Amnesty International nor any other humanitarian organization has
been allowed to visit the prison.
   ``Israel has refused the Red Cross permission to visit the jail
on the grounds that it is controlled by the SLA _ but since the
Israelis themselves control the SLA, Red Cross officials have
privately told The Independent that they believe Israel's excuse is
unacceptable,'' it said.
   It said kidnappers of Western hostages in Lebanon had repeatedly
demanded the release of Khiam prisoners.
   The newspaper said about 325 men and women were held in the
prison, some because they were suspected of anti-Israeli guerrilla
activities and others because their families sympathized with the
Lebanese resistance movement.
   It said the Israelis had suspended all family visits to the
prison since spring of last year.
   ``Neither the Israelis nor the SLA provide lists of inmates, nor
will they allow the Red Cross to compile such a list,'' it said.
``But The Independent has acquired the names of 58 prisoners, all
of whom come from just seven small villages in the far southeast of
Lebanon. Two men _ one 25, the other 30 _ have been incarcerated in
Khiam for five years, it said.
   ``United Nations records show that they were originally escorted
there not only by SLA men but by plain clothes Israeli Shin Bet
agents. A 20-year-old has been held since January 1987, and 20
others since 1988.
   ``The SLA admitted that two prisoners were killed last year
`while trying to escape.' United Nations officers have been told
they were asphyxiated with tear gas during a riot.''
   The Shin Bet is Israel's domestic security service.

<HEAD>AP, British Media Ordered to Give Riot Film to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ordered The 
photographers.
   The fourth organization, Fleet Street News Agency, made no
objection.
   On March 6, Denison ordered 25 British newspapers and TV
companies to turn over film of the riot, which engulfed London's
theater district folowing a huge demonstration against a new tax.
   Police, who are still examining film, then sought film held by
the agencies and London Weekend Television on the ground that it
was needed to help identify rioters.
   Britain's 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act provides that a
judge can order news media to turn over material in the case of
serious offenses.
   The judge said AP, Press Association and London Weekend
Television were right to oppose the application.
   ``Orders such as this should not be made as a matter of
course,'' he said.
   ``It would be wrong if the media were to back down and concede
every application that is made,'' he said. ``They are perfectly
entitled to come to court and put their arguments.''
   The order, which the judge is to sign Monday, means AP and Press
Association must give police all negatives of the riot.
   The violence broke out after demonstrators, led by anarchists,
tried to storm Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 Downing Street
office. They then attacked police and rampaged across London's West
End.
   Nearly 500 police officers and 86 civilians were injured, and
hundreds of shops were looted and cars burned.
   ``If applications routinely succeed, there is a loss of the
perceived independence of the media,'' Robin Oppenheim, legal
counsel for the three news organizations, told the court.
   In 1988, British television companies initially refused to hand
police film of an Irish Republican Army funeral in Northern Ireland
at which two British soldiers were murdered. The companies later
released their film saying they had to comply with the law.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders U.S. Officials To Explain Mexican Doctor's
Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered law enforcement
officials to explain how a Mexican doctor was brought to the United
States to face trial in the slaying of U.S. drug agent.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, a suspect in the 1985
torture-slaying of Enrique Camarena, was arrested April 3 in El
Paso, Texas. DEA officials have denied published reports and
allegations by Alvarez's lawyer that he was kidnapped in Mexico by
bounty hunters paid as much as $100,000.
   ``It is my understanding,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Manuel
Medrano, ``that for a significant time the United States has had
standing offers on the street in Mexico and Guadalajara of rewards
for the capture and delivery to the United States of any fugitive
in Mexico in connection with the Camarena case.''
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie on Thursday ordered
proseuctors to bring witnesses to court who could explain the
arrest in detail.
   Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said
Wednesday the incident might hinder U.S.-Mexico cooperation in the
drug war. A senior Mexican government official told The Associated
Press that officials believe Alvarez was abducted by bounty hunters
and that Mexican police were not involved.
   Mexico has asked for an explanation, and Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh said an investigation is being conducted.
   Medrano said no U.S. agents entered Mexico to participate in the
arrest. A confidential informant called DEA agents on April 2,
saying Alvarez was in custody and would be taken to El Paso the
following day, he said.
   Alvarez' attorney, Robert K. Steinberg, said he would argue that
his client could not be prosecuted because of how he was brought
into the United States.
   Steinberg told the judge his client was kidnapped from his
Guadalajara office by men who identified themselves as Mexican
police and who said he was under arrest for performing an illegal
abortion.
   Alvarez was taken to Texas aboard a private plane, Steinberg
said. He said Alvarez told him one of six men on the plane
identified himself as a DEA agent.
   In today's editions of the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper said
sources in Mexico reported that bounty hunters were paid $100,000
to deliver Alvarez to DEA agents.
   The El Paso Herald-Post on April 11 quoted unnamed federal
sources as saying the DEA paid $50,000 to a pilot and an assistant
who flew Alvarez into the United States.
   The U.S. government has alleged that in 1985 Alvarez gave
Camarena drugs to revive him for additional torturing before his
slaying. Alvarez is among 18 people accused in Camarena's
kidnapping and murder.
   Prosecutors say Camarena was tortured and killed by members of a
drug trafficking operation that distributed tons of marijuana and
cocaine.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adem Demaqi, believed to be
Yugoslavia's longest-serving political prisoner with a total of
nearly 28 years in detention, has been pardoned, a senior official
announced today.
   The name of 54-year-old Demaqi, an ethnic Albanian, was included
on a list of 108 political prisoners pardoned Wednesday, said Stipe
Suvar, a member of the collective leadership. Demaqi was one of 103
ethnic Albanians among them.
   Two Yugoslav republics are holding free elections this month in
line with the wave of reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, and the
pardons were seen as indicating some relaxation of Communist rule
on the federal level.
   Another 190 political prisoners will remain in detention, Suvar
added. He said that some will be granted amnesty, however, and
their number will be reduced to 70 before 1991.
   Demaqi was one of the key ethnic Albanian activists in Kosovo
province, the site of historic tensions between Slavs and
Albanians. He was sentenced to three years in jail in 1958 for
attempting to set up an illegal separatist organization.
   Six years later he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for
founding the Revolutionary Movement For the Unification of
Shiptars, as Albanians call themselves.
   He served 10 years of his second sentence before he was given a
concurrent 15-year term in 1975 for conspiring against the people
and the state. He had been due for release in October.
   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise a 90-percent majority,
was rocked in March by violent protests over constitutional
amendments giving Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, nearly
complete control over the province.
   The amendments were said to be necessary to protect Slavs in
Kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians and to prevent
the secession of Kosovo from Yugoslavia.
   Yugoslav authorities lifted a state of emergency in Kosovo on
Wednesday at Serbia's request, after Serbia completed its takeover
of the province's police. Serbia had charged that local police were
inactive during the unrest that claimed more than 60 lives.
   Demaqi's pardon also appeared to be part of a recent move by the
federal government to cool Albanian tempers in Kosovo. On Thursday,
charges against Azem Vlasi, the popular former Kosovo Communist
Party chief, were modified to remove the threat of execution. He is
accused of fomenting unrest among fellow ethnic-Albanians last year.
   The move was seen as preparing the ground for Vlasi's release
and an eventual start of negotiations with the ethnic Albanian
opposition _ something hard-line Serbian leaders have rejected so
far.

<HEAD>College Profs Espouse Rival Racial Superiority Theories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clashing theories of racial superiority espoused
by two tenured professors _ one white and one black _ have prompted
an inquiry by City College into the limits of academic freedom, The
New York Times reported in today's editions.
   The school's student body is 39 percent black, 28 percent
Hispanic, 17 percent white and 16 percent Asian.
   The white teacher, Michael Levin, a professor of philosophy, has
written at least three articles for academic journals contending
that ``it has been amply confirmed over the last several decades
that on average, blacks are significantly less intelligent than
whites,'' the Times said.
   Levin has argued that a deficiency in intelligence, rather than
discrimination or poverty, accounts for the underrepresentation of
blacks in fields like medicine, engineering and philosophy,'' the
Times said. Levin holds a doctorate in philosophy.
   The black professor, Leonard Jeffries Jr., chairman of the black
studies department, calls people of European ancestry ``the ice
people'' and portrays them in his classes as fundamentally
materialistic, greedy and intent on domination. He calls people of
African descent ``the sun people'' and says they are essentially
humanistic and communal, the Times said.
   He has passed out booklets to his students that argue that an
abundance of skin pigment gives blacks intellectual and physical
advantages over whites.
   In a class Wednesday, Jeffries said ``rich Jews who financed the
development of Europe also financed the slave trade,'' the Times
said. Jeffries has a doctorate in public law and government.
   Levin has been rebuked by the faculty senate and barred for one
semester from teaching an introductory philosophy course.
   Dr. Bernard W. Harleston, the college president, said Thursday
he had decided to name a committee to ``review the question of when
speech, both in and outside the classroom, may go beyond the
protection of academic freedom and may become conduct unbecoming a
faculty member.''
   He said the committee would review both cases.

<HEAD>Legendary Estate of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks Razed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pickfair, the legendary estate of
Hollywood film stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, has been
razed so actress-singer Pia Zadora and her multimillionare husband
can build a palace.
   The rambling estate, first built as a hunting lodge, was dubbed
the Buckingham Palace of Hollywood. Albert Einstein, Charlie
Chaplin and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were some who passed
through its doors.
   Prima ballerina Anna Pavlova danced there. Maurice Chevalier
sang there. Rudolph Valentino, Clark Gable and Joan Crawford
attended parties there.
   Originally surrounded by 15 acres of gardens, lawns and tree
groves, the property now takes up less than three acres.
   Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the actor's son from another marriage,
was saddened by the demise of Pickfair.
   ``I regret it very much,'' Fairbanks said Thursday. ``I wonder,
if they were going to demolish it, why they bought it in the first
place.''
   The Beverly Hills Historical Society raised no objections when
Miss Zadora and husband Meshulam Riklis announced plans to demolish
the home to make way for a Renaissance-style Venetian palazzo.
   ``I've got a funny feeling about it, because it's no longer
Pickfair to me,'' said Phyllis Lerner, historical society
president. ``It really wasn't a pretty house, but my God, the guest
list!''
   ``The house has been changed through the years a number of times
so that it no longer is the original Pickfair,'' Paul Selwyn,
chairman of the city Planning Commission, said last summer when the
commission approved the project.
   Contractor Rob Myers said the ravages of time and termites made
demolition inevitable.
   ``Once we got into it, it was like cancer,'' Myers said. ``We
kept cutting away at the bad stuff, trying to get at the good stuff
until we got down to the foundation. And the foundation didn't have
any steel in it, so we couldn't build on that and we had to keep
going.''
   Miss Zadora and Riklis bought the estate from Los Angeles Lakers
owner Jerry Buss in 1988 for $6.6 million.
   The couple reportedly plan to spend $5 million to build their
tile-roofed palazzo, adding 2,754 square feet to the original
13,421 square feet of interior space.
   Miss Pickford appeared in such films as ``Pollyanna,'' ``Tess of
the Storm Country'' and ``Little Annie Rooney.'' Fairbanks was the
swashbuckling hero of ``Zorro,'' ``The Thief of Bagdad'' and
``Robin Hood.''
   Miss Pickford and Fairbanks divorced in 1934. After she retired
from acting, her third husband, Buddy Rogers, opened the estate for
charity fund-raisers. She died in 1979 at age 86.
   Miss Zadora appeared in the films ``Lonely Lady'' and
``Butterfly,'' two phenomenal flops in the early '80s, but has
since launched a successful career singing torch songs from the
'40s and '50s. Her husband is head of Riklis Family Corp., which
was No. 47 on Forbes magazine's 1989 list of top 400 privately
owned companies.

   Israel's Supreme Court today allowed 150 Jewish
settlers to remain in a compound in the city's Christian Quarter
until the high court hears more arguments in the case.
   The high court ruled in response to an order by Attorney General
Yosef Harish on Thursday that the settlers immediately leave the
72-room, four-building complex inside Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   The settlers created a furor and ignited demonstrations by both
Christians and Moslems when they moved into the building owned by
the Greek Orthodox Church on April 11.
   The church claims that a former tenant illegally sold his user
rights to the building to the settlers.
   Harish, backed by two lower court decisions, on Thursday ordered
the settlers to leave because their presence had harmed
Christian-Jewish relations in Jerusalem.
   But the three-judge Supreme Court panel issued a restraining
order against the eviction today and asked Harish to show at a
hearing next Thursday why his order should not be annulled.
   ``The settlers will be allowed to stay until there is a final
decision by the high court,'' said attorney Dan Avi-Yitzhak, who
represents a Panama-based company that bought the rights to use the
complex.
   Yohanan Altbauer, an attorney representing the church, said the
judges offered a compromise under which the settlers would have
left the building, but a few company representatives would have
remained until lower courts decided on tenancy rights.
   ``Both sides rejected the compromise,'' Altbauer said.
   Uzi Atzmon, an attorney for the settlers, said on Thursday that
a second appeal would be filed with the court challenging the
entire eviction process.
   Also Thursday, a leaflet issued by the underground leadership of
the Palestinian uprising threatened to execute the former tenant,
an Armenian, and others involved in the deal.
   The leaflet said, however, that the order ``will not be carried
out until further notice.''
   In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras instructed
Greece's representative in Israel to urge the Israeli government to
carry out the lower court's eviction order immediately.
   Tensions rose because the settlement upset the traditional
division of the religious communities in the Old City. There are
about 50,000 Moslems, 7,000 Christians and 4,000 Jews in the old,
walled city.
   The settlement also has political implications, since the Old
City is part of the area captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israel annexed the area into its capital, but most countries,
including the United States, do not recognize Israel's claim to
sovereignty. Palestinians have demanded Jerusalem become the
capital of their would-be independent state.
   When attorney general Harish told the settlers to leave
Thursday, he said he took the action to prevent a further
deterioration of relations between the Christian and Jewish
communities in Jerusalem.
   However, Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Bach stayed Harish's
order, allowing the Jews to remain.

   Dozens of Red Army soldiers stormed
into a printing plant today and beat civilian guards in a renewal
of the Kremlin's strong-arm tactics against Lithuania's
independence drive, witnesses said.
   In another development, Lithuania's Communist Party chief
appealed for compromise on pro-independence decisions after the
Kremlin extended its embargo to more goods and raw materials,
threatening widespread unemployment.
   And the foreign minister of the neighboring Baltic republic of
Estonia said it rejects Soviet threats and inducements and refuses
to rescind a declaration proclaiming itself an occupied,
independent state.
   The soldiers, some armed with truncheons and assault rifles,
forced their way into a Communist Party printing plant in the
center of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, said witness Angele
Guobiene.
   The soldiers beat some of the several dozen armed civilians who
have been on guard for several weeks, said Guobiene, who works for
the trade union journal Darbas Ir Poilsis which is printed at the
plant.
   Algimantas Cekuolis, a newspaper editor, said about 12 people
were hurt, including a legislator who tried to keep the soldiers
from entering. Two or three people were hospitalized, Cekuolis said.
   Police did not allow reporters who arrived after the incident to
enter the building. Soldiers were visible behind a black iron gate
in the courtyard of the building and some workers barricaded
themselves near printing presses and looked out open windows from
second- and third-floor windows.
   A crowd of 500 people gathered on the street below, singing
nationalist songs and carrying the hammer and sickle of the Soviet
Union merged with the Nazi swastika.
   Soldiers began occupying buildings in Vilnius a month ago, among
them the republic's Communist Party headquarters and a plant that
prints the republic's newspapers. The plant occupied today prints
the trade union journal, a humor magazine and other non-political
magazines.
   Soldiers also beat some Lithuanians last month as they rounded
up army deserters.
   Today's crackdown came amid an energy embargo the Kremlin has
imposed on Lithuania in an effort to force it to rescind laws
asserting independence.
   In Key Largo, Fla., President Bush and visiting French President
Francois Mitterrand both said they were ``deeply disturbed'' by the
Kremlin's energy embargo. Bush told reporters he was ``considering
appropriate measures to be taken in light of Soviet actions.''
   Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas urged
compromise in the confrontation with Moscow.
   ``In two weeks we will have a critical situation,'' he told the
Lithuanian parliament. ``The price for independence must have
limits.''
   Deputies of the Supreme Council, Lithuania's parliament,
immediately accused him of trying to slow their Baltic republic's
independence drive.
   ``You're raising a white flag,'' charged Kazis Saya, a writer.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters his
republic must be prepared for a long embargo, such as the 900-day
Nazi siege Leningrad suffered during World War II.
   ``They accepted strict rationing. They helped each other. They
didn't think about capitulation,'' Landsbergis said.
   The Soviets tightened their economic noose on Lithuania Thursday
by shutting off more than 80 percent of its gas supply following a
complete cutoff of oil the previous night.
   Lithuania, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940,
has rejected Soviet demands to rescind its March 11 declaration of
independence. It is entirely dependent on Moscow for oil and gas,
which it receives at below-market prices.
   The government today imposed an eight-gallon per month limit on
gasoline for private cars, and some large factories that normally
open on Saturdays planned to give workers a day off. But republic
officials took no other steps to conserve.
   On Thursday, Lithuanian officials said the first to lose their
energy supplies will be Soviet military bases and the 96 factories
run by Moscow ministries, according to the parliament's press
office.
   The energy embargo left Lithuania with only 15 percent to 17
percent of the 18 million cubic meters of natural gas it uses daily
for homes and industry. Lithuanians say they have enough oil to
last six weeks to three months.
   Brazauskas, chief of the Lithuanian Communist Party and chairman
of the parliament's emergency energy committee, said many
Lithuanian factories would have to close not only because of the
fuel shortage but because Soviet factories have cut supplies of
goods and raw materials ranging from tires to electric motors,
cables and packaging.
   This will undoubtedly lead to great unemployment and some
factories are considering giving workers early vacations, he said.
   ``People of the highest rank must go to Moscow to negotiate,''
he said, uring lawmakers to make a political decision ``to take us
out of this dead end.''
   A delegation of Lithuanian officials plans to travel to Moscow
on Monday in hope of meeting with Kremlin officials to discuss the
standoff.
   Gorbachev has refused to negotiate with the Lithuanians until
they rescind their independence declaration. He demands that
Lithuania roll back legislation to stop conscription into the
Soviet army, attempts to seize property of the Soviet Communist
Party and the introduction of identity cards for citizens.
   These are the demands that Brazauskas indicated the republic
should compromise on.
   Lithuania normally produces its own electricity at a nuclear
power plant at Ignalina, but it is shut for repairs. Daina Kalendra
of the parliamentary press office said the republic has suffered no
electricity shortage, and other plants are operating, including a
hydroelectric plant near Kaunas.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was in Norway to
discuss contracts for expensive Western oil. The Norwegian oil
company Statoil said it would sell to Lithuania for hard currency,
but Mrs. Prunskiene said the republic would need credit to buy the
oil.
   Gorbachev met leaders of Latvia and Estonia in separate meetings
in the Kremlin on Thursday and alternately tried concessions and
threats to stop their drives for independence.
   He offered both republics ``special status'' in a
``confederative'' Soviet Union if they quit trying to secede,
Baltic officials and journalists said.
   In Helsinki, Finland, today, Estonian Foreign Minister Lennart
Meri said Estonia rejects Gorbachev's threatened sanctions and
refuses to rescind a declaration proclaiming itself an occupied,
independent state.
   Foreign reporters, whom Moscow officials had barred from
Lithuania at the end of last month, were allowed to return in
limited numbers Thursday on a trip organized by the Soviet Foreign
Ministry. Free travel by foreigners to Lithuania is still largely
banned.

will be buried in a northwest Atlanta cemetery near his home, his
family announced Friday.
   Abernathy will be buried at Lincoln Cemetery, said his niece,
Brenda Russell. Lincoln Cemetery is a tree-shaded, historically
black cemetery located about two miles from Abernathy's home.
   Abernathy, a native of Linden, Ala., died Tuesday of a heart

   Kim Basinger's brother-in-law said today it
is he, not the actress who is negotiating to buy an Albany
television station whose principal owner is plagued by legal
problems.
   The station's president and general manager, Manny Cantu, said
Thursday that Ms. Basinger was among several bidders for WFXL
Channel 31, a Fox affiliate. But Gary Guyer of Atlanta, Ms.
Basinger's brother-in-law and president of the Brazelton Group,
said today the actress is not involved.
   ``Everybody knows I'm affiliated with Kim, but in this case it's
my deal,'' said Guyer, whose firm helped the 36-year-old actress
purchase most of the northeast Georgia town of Braselton. ``She is
not buying that station.''
   The station has been owned since 1988 by New South Group Inc.,
headed by 44-year-old Timothy Brumlik of Orlando, Fla. He was
arrested in September after accepting $1 million from an informant
pretending to invest profits for Columbian drug dealers, officials
said.
   Investigators have said they have no information that the
millionaire channeled any of the allegedly laundered funds into
television stations.
   Ms. Basinger, a Georgia native, in January purchased 1,800 acres
in northeast Georgia, including much of downtown Braselton.

   Pete Rose pleaded guilty today to felony tax
charges for failing to report income, including winnings from his
illegal gambling that led to his banishment from baseball.
   Rose, former player and manager of the Cincinnati Reds baseball
team, admitted that he did not report $354,968 in income over four
years.
   The two felony counts of filing false federal income tax returns
carry a maximum penalty of three years in jail on each count. He
also could be fined up to $250,000 on each count. The government
agreed not to pursue any other tax charges against Rose in return
for the plea.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel accepted Rose's guilty
plea, but gave no indication when he might sentence Rose.
   Rose stood with his hands folded and clearly answered ``Yes,
sir'' to questions the judge asked before accepting the guilty
plea. He made no comment as he walked from the courtroom to meet
with probation officers.
   Last August, Rose accepted a lifetime ban from the game after
admitting he bet through bookmakers, although he denies betting on
baseball or his team.
   The plea agreement ends a one-year investigation by federal
prosecutors into whether Rose claimed all of his income from
gambling, autograph appearances and memorabilia sales.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Hunt said the probe found no
evidence of involvement by Rose in the drug activities of his
former associates, but did show that Rose was ``a chronic gambler''
who hid large amounts of income from his financial advisers.
   Hunt said, for example, that Rose owned a share of a $47,646
racetrack payoff and that he sold the baseball bat he used for his
4,192nd hit _ which made him baseball's all-time hits leader _ for
$129,000.
   As part of his plea agreement, Rose admits he underreported his
income from 1984-87. He reported a total of $4.6 million in income
for those years, paying $2 million in taxes, but hid $354,968.
   Hunt said Rose has repaid the Internal Revenue Service
$366,042.86 in back taxes, interest and penalties.
   Thursday, Rose said he was unconcerned about a possible jail
sentence.
   ``I know I'm not a bad person, but I did make some mistakes and
it's in the eyes of the judge,'' Rose said, during his weekly talk
show Thursday night on WCKY-AM in Cincinnati. ``All you can say is
it's up to the judge.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf pvs, `Sen. Sam ...' to CORRECT difference
between Nunn proposal and budget committee to $1.5 billion sted of
$2.5 billion.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said today that President Bush's 1991 military budget
must be slashed, but not as severely as proposed by the
Democrati-controlled House Budget Committee.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., proposed defense spending of $297 billion
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, $1.5 billion more than the
committee approved on Thursday. Bush has proposed a $303 billion
defense budget.
   ``I believe this range is a realistic and responsible target,''
Nunn said in a speech on the Senate floor.
   Nunn proposed limiting spending on the Strategic Defense
Initiative to about $4 billion, the amount Congress appropriated
for the anti-missile shield last year.
   The Armed Services chairman also called for delaying the
Pentagon's plans to move the multiple-warhead, MX nuclear missile
from fixed silos to railroad cars.
   ``In the first element of the new military strategy _ nuclear
deterrence _ these and other actions could save on the order of $3
billion to $3.5 billion in fiscal 1991 and between $20 and $30
billion over the next five years,'' Nunn said.
   House Democrats plan to bring their proposed $1.24 trillion 1991
budget to the floor next week in what looms as a test of their plan
to begin slashing tens of billions of dollars in military spending.
   The House Budget Committee approved the spending package on a
21-14 party-line vote, as majority Democrats dealt a blow to Bush's
plans to only slightly trim the defense budget. The action marked
the formal beginning of the battle over how federal spending
priorities should be reshaped in response to the dismemberment of
the Soviet bloc.
   ``We live in a far different world from the one which we have
known for most of our lifetimes,'' said committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   The defense figures are supported by Democratic leaders and are
meant as a compromise between the party's liberal and conservative
wings. Nonetheless, the size of the cuts is distasteful to
conservatives, raising questions about whether their support can be
counted on for final passage next week.
   With Democrats holding a 258-176 House majority, defections by
large numbers of the party's conservatives could make approval
uncertain. Republicans want the budget to be written after
negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders, and
virtually all GOP lawmakers are expected to oppose the Democratic
package.
   ``It gives a lot of us conservatives real heartburn,'' Rep.
Jerry Huckaby, D-La., said of the defense proposal. ``At this
point, there isn't a conservative consensus about whether we'll be
able to support the'' Democratic measure.
   Huckaby estimated there were 40 conservative Democrats who
shared his concerns.
   Panetta predicted passage of the proposal, arguing that
conservatives would ultimately see the defense figures as
bargaining positions in future negotiations with the Senate and
perhaps the White House.
   Overall, the Democratic package claims to trim the deficit by
$36 billion to just less than $64 billion, just within the target
required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   Besides defense cuts, it relies on $13.9 billion in new taxes _
the same figure Bush wants _ and $1.4 billion in user fees.
   It also calls for $9.3 billion in savings from a combination of
sources: improved tax collections by the Internal Revenue Service,
user fees that congressional committees have rejected in the past
and other efforts.
   An additional $3.8 billion would be saved by limiting the growth
of Medicare and other benefit programs. The Budget Committee had
said it expected to save $4.2 billion in this category, but leaders
of the House Ways and Means Committee _ which oversees Medicare _
said they did not want such deep cuts in the health care program
for the elderly.
   The proposal would also boost federal aid for scientists,
aviation safety, and the Head Start program for poor pre-school
children.
   The Senate Budget Committee hopes to begin working on its own
version of the spending plan next week.
   The budget, which does not require the president's signature,
lays out a fiscal blueprint. Congress will consider separate bills
that will make the final spending and tax decisions.

   The Hubble Space Telescope's
batteries have enough power after 130 hours of recharging to permit
five launch attempts next week of the craft that will carry it into
space, NASA says.
   ``We're right on schedule,'' Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said Thursday.
``There are no problems.''
   The shuttle Discovery is due to lift off 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   The space agency has until April 28 to launch the shuttle,
carrying the $1.5 billion telescope. Otherwise, the mission must be
delayed eight days so the telescope's six nickel-hydrogen batteries
can be recharged more.
   Recharging the batteries in a laboratory from Sunday through
Thursday provided enough strength for ``one additional contingency
day'' for a launch attempt, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   ``It's a full charge. We got everything that we set out to
get,'' Diller said.
   NASA finished recharging the batteries at noon Thursday.
Technicians then prepared the batteries for transfer from a
laboratory to the launch pad.
   NASA opened Discovery's payload bay doors today and the
technicians began installing the batteries in the telescope. The
batteries were to be tested late tonight and early Saturday, and
the payload bay sealed Sunday in preparation for Tuesday's
scheduled liftoff.
   ``They haven't had any problems and they are running ahead of
schedule,'' Malone said.
   The batteries will power the telescope, NASA's most expensive
and complex payload, from the time it is disconnected from the
shuttle's power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are
unfurled in space.
   The countdown to launch was to begin Saturday afternoon.
Discovery's five astronauts were to arrive Sunday.
   Once in orbit 380 miles above Earth, Hubble will be capable of
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best ground-based observatory. Astronomers expect
to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling for 14 billion years, close to the beginning of time.

   Three crewmen were reported missing after a
Panamanian freighter sank Friday following a collision with another
Panamanian vessel about 75 miles east of this British colony, the
government said.
   A statement said 16 crewmen from the Regent Kapuas were rescued
by the Ocean Blessing, a container ship that was involved in the
collision.
   It said a Royal Navy patrol craft picked up the survivors _ 15
Filipinos and one Japanese _ from the Oceas up to two hours making a
single gavel.
   Starting with a block of raw wood, Beaton makes grooves, bevels
and flutes with an assortment of hand chisels and wood-burning
devices and applies several finishing coats of clear, acrylic
lacquer.
   Beaton follows a fixed design that he says has been traditional
for a century or more, though nobody knows for sure.
   ``When I came here nearly seven years ago, I was told this is
the way we've always made them, and I should make them just like
this,'' he says. ``I've never done it any other way.''
   The shiny, blond-hued gavels, which Beaton estimates are worth
$75 apiece, are kept in a drawer at the speaker's marble-topped
rostrum for the exclusive use of the speaker or the legislator he
appoints to preside over the House during floor action on
legislation.
   Although a Washington newspaper article published in 1923
claimed that ``some years ago it was not unusual for 100 gavels or
more to be smashed in one Congress,'' broken gavels are a rarity
today.
   Their replacement is necessary, instead, because the speakers
like to autograph their gavels and present them as gifts to
constituents, friends or to fellow legislators who have steered
major bills to final passage.
   Veteran House parliamentarians recall that some House speakers,
notably Sam Rayburn of Texas, have wielded their gavels with a
heavy hand, but none has banged one into smithereens in recent
memory.
   Former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, a big Irishman from Boston,
frequently tapped gently with his gavel's handle to persuade
lawmakers to quiet down.
   One of the loudest gavel-bangers was former Rep. Richard
Bolling, D-Mo., who presided over floor debate and voting on scores
of bills from the speaker's chair during his 34-year House career.
   Bolling, interviewed by telephone from his retirement home in
rural Maryland, remembered breaking two gavels in those years.
``Fortunately, nobody got hurt,'' he said.

   Oklahoma teachers returned to classrooms
today after their four-day strike forced state lawmakers to forge a
compromise on education spending that would raise teachers' minimum
salaries.
   ``It shows that with solidarity the system works. Now we can go
back to school,'' said Carolyn Meyer, an elementary music teacher
in Stillwater.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate approved an emergency clause
Thursday that allows a $230 million education reform and tax bill
to become law as soon as it is signed by Republican Gov. Henry
Bellmon. The governor said he will sign the bill.
   ``Everybody's just feeling great,'' Stillwater Superintendent
Bill Hodges said.
   The emergency clause had been a stumbling block to the package
and the Senate's failure to pass it last week prompted the
31,000-member Oklahoma Education Association to call for a five-day
walkout. Republicans opposed the bill.
   It calls for spending $68.1 million to raise minimum teacher
salaries by $1,500 a year for four years. Oklahoma teachers say
they rank 48th in pay among the states, making $22,000 a year
compared with the national average of $29,648.
   The teachers' association said the passage would end the
walkout, except for teachers in schools already set to close today.
A ``thank-you rally'' that had been planned for the Capitol was
canceled because of the rain.
   Also today, the union voted to recommend its political action
committee endorse House Speaker Steve Lewis, chief architect of the
school bill, for the Democratic nomination for governor. Two
delegates spoke against the recommendation, but it passed by a wide
margin.
   The association said schools in 145 districts were closed
Thursday. Among those were Tulsa, Oklahoma City and Lawton, the
three largest districts in the state with about 95,000 students.
The union did not have a count today on the number of districts
closed.
   State education officials have said the walkout has affected
about 60 percent, or 343,200, of the state's 572,000 students. The
state has 606 school districts.
   The education package was enacted by a 32-14 vote after five
Senate Democrats switched their votes in return for support for a
bill that would give low-income families a tax break. The package
needed 32 votes to pass.
   Sponsors said the measure will put Oklahoma in the forefront of
education reform.
   ``It's going to connect us to the rest of the country,'' said
Sen. Stratton Taylor, a Democrat. ``We're not going to be a Third
World state.''
   ``A new day is dawning for education in Oklahoma,'' said the
governor, who supported the education plan but drew virtually no
backing from the Senate's Republican minority.
   ``Oklahoma will no longer take a back seat among the states
where education is concerned,'' Bellmon said. ``From now on, others
can look to Oklahoma for leadership in education.''
   The union's president, Kyle Dahlem, said teachers had never had
such a comprehensive program with which to work. ``Now it's up to
the people of Oklahoma to make us accountable for seeing that the
program works,'' she said.
   The measure was passed after an eight-month special session.

   A Mexican physician accused of participating
in the 1985 killing of a U.S. drug agent won't be returned home
even if his arrest violated Mexican sovereignty, the Justice
Department said today.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he ``did not
foresee any circumstances'' under which Humberto Alvarez Machain
would be returned to Mexico rather than face charges in Los Angeles
of participating in the 1985 kidnapping and murder of Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   Alvarez's attorney charges that the Guadalajara gynecologist was
kidnapped and taken to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by DEA
agents.
   The arrest sparked a diplomatic protest from the Mexican
government.
   In Los Angeles on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie
ordered prosecutors to explain how Alvarez was brought to the
United States.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who returned Thursday from a
hemispheric drug enforcement conference in Ixtapa, Mexico, has
ordered DEA to give him a full report on the arrest.
   Runkel said talks Thornburgh had with Mexican Attorney General
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo before he left Ixtapa assuaged Mexican
officials, who had threatened to stop cooperating with U.S.
anti-drug efforts.
   ``We were assured that relations between Mexico and the United
Sates remained strong and that cooperation on drug law enforcement
would continue,'' Runkel told reporters.
   ``Any threat, if one existed, to continued cooperation was
substantially lessened as a result of the bilateral talks in
Ixtapa,'' Runkel said.
   The Mexican attorney general said Wednesday that the arrest
might hinder continued cooperation by his country with U.S.
authorities in the war on drug trafficking.
   On Thursday, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had
unusually strong words for the United States in a speech to the
Ixtapa conference on drug trafficking.
   Mexico ``will not permit anybody, not drug traffickers nor their
pursuers, to violate Mexican rights,'' he said.
   ``In the fight against drugs, the law is rendered useless by
illegal actions, or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of
one country in foreign territory,'' Salinas said.
   Runkel said Thornburgh and his Mexican counterpart held their
final meeting after Salinas' speech.
   Thornburgh assured the Mexican attorney general that ``he had
insisted upon a full, complete and immediate investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the apprehension'' of Alvarez.
   ``Appropriate action would be forthcoming when a report of the
results of that investigation was in hand,'' Runkel said.
   But Runkel said federal authorities would not return Alvarez to
Mexico if Thornburgh had determined that DEA had violated any
Justice Department policies, Mexican sovereignty or law.
   ``I don't foresee any circumstances under which he would be
returned to Mexico,'' Runkel said. ``He faces criminal charges in
this country.''
   A long line of U.S. court decisions have held that a fugitive
can stand trial in this country even if his arrest overseas was
improper.

   A handyman accused of setting a shotgun booby trap
that killed an intruder in his warehouse turned himself in to face
a possible murder charge, and was ordered held without bond today.
   Philip Connaghan, 46, was booked at the Denver County Jail for
investigation of first-degree murder Thursday.
   Denver County Judge Larry Bohning denied him bail this morning,
leaving the district attorney's office three days to decide whether
to press charges.
   District Attorney Norm Early said before the court hearing that
he would make no recommendation about bail.
   ``We don't want to rush to judgment,'' Early said Thursday when
he announced Connaghan was in custody. ``Whatever the judge feels
is an appropriate bond is fine with me.''
   Early said that if Connaghan were allowed to post bond, there
would be no deadline for filing charges, which he said could range
from ``first-degree murder to nothing.''
   Michael McComb, 19, of Denver was shot in the chest Saturday
night by a 12-gauge shotgun inside the warehouse Connaghan leased.
Three youths who were with McComb said they entered the warehouse
for an adventure not as thieves. They were booked for investigation
of burglary and released to their parents.
   Police said the shotgun was attached to a trip wire they believe
Connaghan rigged. The front door of the warehouse bore the
inscription: ``Danger _ Enter at own risk.''
   Connaghan was in Kansas when McComb was killed and told police
the next day in a telephone conversation that he had no knowledge
of the booby trap.
   The warehouse had been burglarized eight times since 1987. The
handyman lost more than $7,000 in tools during a burglary last July.
   Early said he has received hundreds of calls and a lot of
unsolicited advice on how to handle the case, ranging from ``give
the man a medal to hang him up.''

   Nine male guards have resigned after a
monthlong investigation into sexual misconduct with women inmates
at a county prison, the state corrections commissioner said.
   Three guards admitted having sex inmates at the Rankin County
prison; the six others resigned rather than proceed with the
investigation, Commissioner Lee Roy Black said Thursday.
   ``No force was used by the employees. Participation by the
inmates was fully voluntary,'' Black said in releasing details of
the investigation at the 660-bed prison. He said many of the
inmates received money in exchange for sex but that it was not ``a
prostitution ring.''
   Five other guards were cleared of sexual misconduct allegations,
he said. The prison, which opened in 1987, has 166 guards. It holds
the state's female inmates and a workforce of male inmates.
   The investigation of 14 guards and 12 inmates began in early
March after prison officials received a tip. Officials said the
early-morning sexual rendezvous took place in the guard towers,
empty cells and the infirmary.
   Prison Superintendent Don Cabana said some sort of disciplinary
action would be taken against the inmates.
   Cabana's report recommended that guards not be allowed to carry
more than $5 cash onto prison grounds, that inmates not be allowed
to carry cash, and other changes. Black said the report will
undergo further review by the department before changes are put
into effect.

<TEXT>
   A family that has been ranching for four
decades has learned that becoming more environmentally sensitive
deosn't mean sacrificing profits.
   The Sims family, headed by 84-year-old patriarch Roy Sims, is
one of a few Wyoming ranch owners using an innovative grazing
technique that increases profits as it improves the land.
   ``We're trying to make a living, but not at the expense of the
land,'' said 35-year-old Scott Sims, who with his brother, Olin,
and father, Don, own and operate the 10,000-acre McFadden Land and
Livestock Co.
   The family was awarded Wyoming's 1989 Outstanding Conservation
Farmer and Rancher Award and sees this Sunday's Earth Day 1990 as
an opportunity to illustrate that ranchers care about the land.
   ``We've got environmentalists accusing livestock men of tearing
up the earth,'' Olin Sims said. ``I hope it's a time
environmentalists realize ranchers are environmentalists, too.''
   A visit to the southern Wyoming ranch on a warm April afternoon
found bawling calves stumbling alongside their mothers on meadows
that have only recently turned from a frozen gray to spring green.
Cottonwoods and elms cast long shadows across a frothing creek
bulging with snow melt.
   But a closer look reveals that the ranch operations are not
typical.
   Last year, Scott and Olin Sims began using the intensive grazing
technique. Instead of allowing their hundreds of cows to roam
freely over large expanses, they sliced the land into small
pastures so cattle graze each section intensively for two to three
days before being moved onto another plot.
   With 300 cows denuding 300 acres, instead of one cow on 40 acres
munching here and there, grass is allowed to regrow and much
erosion is eliminated.
   ``We're `severe grazing.' You go back the next year and it's the
nicest grass on the ranch,'' Scott Sims explained.
   On the heavily grazed sections, the cows act as rototillers with
their trampling and fertilizers with their manure, thus encouraging
healthy new growth. Rain is absorbed more efficiently on the
trampled fields rather than running off hard, overgrazed land, and
noxious weeds are inhibited and so fewer pesticides are needed.
   On the smaller plots, bothersome flies that usually hatch in
manure piles on the open range are trampled to death, saving 50
cents per head in fly abatement costs.
   The Sims say the healthier, lusher grass growth adds an average
of 20 pounds per weened calf.
   ``If we can double the grass production, we can double our
cattle numbers,'' Olin Sims said, adding that the increased fencing
pays for itself. ``It's nice to see these cows cultivate the land
and make money for you, too.''
   With this ``holistic resource management'' technique, ``we never
allow that cow to bite that plant a second time before it's fully
recovered,'' he said.
   Since the cattle are restricted to 5 percent of the ranch at any
one time, the rest of the range is open to wildlife.
   The Simses also plant 150 trees each year, use solar power for
the electrified fencing and water pumps, and maintain enough water
in the creeks for fish to survive.
   With some environmentalists calling for a cattle ban on public
lands, or ``Cattle-free by '93,'' Olin Sims said he has to be
careful. A small part of his ranch is leased from the state and
federal governments.
   ``I'd like to keep the ranch in the family for years and
years,'' he said. ``When you've got Congress and Earth Firsters
breathing down your neck to forbid grazing on public lands, you've
got to be careful. It's worth it.''
   Asked what his grandfather thought of the changes he and his
brother have made, Olin Sims said, ``That's the way this whole
ranch family has been _ always looking for a better way and not
getting stuck in a rut.''

<HEAD>Papal Visit to Czechoslovakia Begins Saturday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's weekend visit
to Czechoslovakia, the first by a pope, will be a symbolic release
for many of the nation's Roman Catholics from their Communist past.
   It also marks a further step in the Vatican's move into Eastern
Europe as new non-Communist governments restore long-broken ties.
   ``In my opinion this is a truly historic event,'' President
Vaclav Havel said in an Easter Sunday radio broadcast.
   ``It is happening one week after Easter. Let us contemplate
about the importance of Easter, sacrifice, resurrection and
redemption.''
   It was Havel who invited the Polish-born pontiff to visit
Czechoslovakia. He issued the invitation only two days after taking
office Dec. 29. The pontiff is to arrive Saturday.
   Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution toppledthe hard-line
Communist leadership of Milos Jakes in 10 days of street protests
and mass rallies.
   It practically coincided with the canonization of St. Agnes, a
Czech, by the pope Nov. 12, and Havel drew a playful link between
the two events.
   ``Many believers think it all went so well because it was a bit
of a miracle from St. Agnes ... I am sure you feel the symbolic
relation,'' Havel said in his radio speech.
   The sterility of the Communist dogma brought about a Christian
renaissance in the late 1980s that was unparalleled in recent
Czechoslovak history.
   ``The past rulers had nothing to offer,'' Vaclav Maly, a former
underground priest and human rights activist, said of the religious
rebirth. ``After some time, the natural longing for dignified life
led to the creation of a community where people can trust one
another.''
   On March 25, 1988, police used dogs and a water cannon to
brutally disperse thousands of believers peacefully rallying in
downtown Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, for more religious
freedom.
   The crackdown became a symbol of religious persecution in
Slovakia, the eastern and strongly Catholic part of Czechoslovakia.
   The same year, more than 600,000 believers signed a petition for
greater freedom of worship.
   While constraints on religious freedom were tightened followed
the crushing of the 1968 Prague Spring reforms, the roots of
church-state conflict go back to the late 1940s, after the
Communists seized power.
   Authorities suspended diplomatic relations with the Vatican on
April 24, 1950. They increased pressure on Catholics, whose
allegiance to a ``foreign power'' _ the Vatican _ was seen as a
threat to stability. Christianity was erased from official history,
religious education was banned in schools.
   The state often refused to give state licences to bishops
appointed by the Vatican, leaving up to 10 of Czechoslovakia's 13
bishoprics vacant.
   In 1970, fearing increasing diplomatic isolation, officials
launched talks on possible renewal of ties. It was not until
Czechoslovakia's revolution opened the way to spiritual freedom
that relations with the Vatican warmed considerably.
   On March 29, 1990, an official Czechoslovak delegation in Rome
presented Pope John Paul II with a request to renew diplomatic
ties. They were formally restored Thursday.
   Czechoslovakia was the third Warsaw Pact nation to restore
relations with the Holy See, after Poland and Hungary. In his drive
to strengthen the church in the East, John Paul has visited his
native Poland three times as pope and has scheduled trips to
Hungary and Poland next year.
   For Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, 90, the visit will be a
vindication of decades of courageous resistance to Communist
pressures.
   ``It will be a great awakening of consciousness,'' said Tomasek,
who spent four years in a labor camp in the 1950s.
   Some 3 million believers from Czechoslovakia as well as
neighboring Poland and Hungary are expected to flood Prague,
Velehrad and the Slovak capital of Bratislava over the weekend,
when John Paul gives his blessing to the country's estimated 9
million Catholics.
   The visit also has an indirect political dimension, coming 50
days before the country's first free post-Communist elections on
June 8-9.
   It could significantly boost the popularity of the increasingly
strong alliance of Czechoslovak Christian Democrats, who dominated
elections in East Germany and Hungary.

<TEXT>
   The White House said today that new
terrorist demands over the promised release of an American hostage
were a ``smokescreen'' and part of a troubling pattern.
   ``They do it every time,'' presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said when asked if kidnappers holding three Americans
were toying with the United States.
   ``Syria still believes there's a possibility of release. We'll
just have to wait and see if they're sincere and hope that they
are,'' Fitzwater said
   President Bush on Thursday defended his decision not to send a
U.S. envoy to Syria, as the kidnappers demanded before they would
release a hostage. ``The United States does not knuckle under to
demands,'' the president said.
   Fitzwater spoke aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here today
from Key Largo, Fla., to help raise money for an underdog
Republican candidate for the Senate.
   Bush was in Birmingham for a fund-raiser for state Sen. Bill
Cabaniss, a conservative businessman trying to oust incumbent
Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin. He was then flying to Orlando, Fla.,
for another political fund-raiser before returning to Key Largo for
a weekend of fishing.
   In his speech at the Cabaniss fund-raiser, Bush renewed his plea
for passage of a capital gains tax cut, from the current 33-percent
top to 19 percent or lower. The tax in Japan on stocks and bonds is
only 1 percent, Bush said, and other Asian trading rivals ``don't
tax them at all.''
   ``Once again I call on the Congress to pass that bill. It's time
we stop giving the edge to (other) countries,'' said Bush. He also
called for ``rejecting the ideas of extremists on both sides'' of
the environmental debate, and passing a Clean Air bill that doesn't
throw people out of work.
   More than 1500 people attended the event, which raised over a
half million dollars for the candidate.
   Asked about the complaint from the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine that Bush had not dispatched the envoy they
requested to Syria, Fitzwater said, ``That was just a
smokescreen.'' He said the United States had an ambassador in
Damascus capable of conducting any talks that were necessary.
   He called the terrorist demand, which came after they had
proomised to release an American by today, part of ``troublesome
patterns that we've seen before.'' He cited the terrorists' release
of a photograph of one hostage one day, and of another hostage a
day later.
   ``The pattern is very much the same,'' Fitzwater said. ``They
announce the release, put out pictures for videotape or letters and
then there's some demand or reason why it can't happen. So our
attitude is to be prepared to take all the precautions and the
preparations necessary to facilitate it if it does happen, but not
to get overly optimistic.''
   On the crisis in Lithuania, Fitzwater said U.S. officials were
still talking with allies around the world about appropriate
responses to intensified Soviet pressures on the breakaway
republic. ``There's still a lot of unknowns we're trying to work
out,'' Fitzwater said.
   At a marathon waterside news conference in Key Largo Thursday
with visiting French President Francois Mitterrand, Bush indicated
he is moving cautiously on the Lithuanian crisis because of the
importance of the U.S.-Soviet relationship to arms control and
freedom for Eastern Europe.
   But ``there are limits'' to U.S. patience, said Bush.
   The Lithuanian and Middle East hostage situations overshadowed
other topics that Bush discussed at his Key Largo meeting with
Mitterrand, who paid a nine-hour visit to the United States.
   The United States is consulting with France, West Germany and
other allies on what steps to take, but Bush was unwilling to
signal his hand.
   ``My reluctance stems from trying to keep open a dialogue and
discussion that affects many, many countries'' on such sensitive
issues as arms control and the growth of democracy in Eastern
Europe, he said.
   ``I am greatly concerned by this escalation in terms of using
energy to push the Lithuanians into line,'' said Bush. He added it
still was not clear exactly whether the oil and gas supplies to
Vilnius have been cut off.
   On the hostage situation, the president said, ``We've been
disappointed before, hopes raised only to have them dashed by
excessive speculation.''
   Asked why he had not sent John Kelly, assistant secretary of
state for Middle Eastern affairs, to Syria to facilitate the
release, Bush said, ``The United States does not knuckle under to
demands.''
   Eight Americans are among the 17 Western hostages believed to be
held in Lebanon.
   Bush praised Syria ``for trying to play a constructive role'' in
the hostage release.
   He repeated the overture to Iran first made in his inaugural
address 15 months earlier: ``Goodwill begets goodwill.''

   It lay at the bottom of the Mississippi
River for 9{ months, but Chuck Rollins says his artificial arm will
be as good as new with a couple of straps and a cable.
   Rollins, 66, was waterskiing in July when his artificial arm
came off after his son-in-law accelerated the boat too quickly. He
had a new limb made, but knew that someone would find the
flesh-colored arm and wonder where the corpse was.
   The $2,000 prosthesis with stainless steel hooks surfaced on the
end of Corene McCallson's line as she fished Tuesday near
Brownsville in southeastern Minnesota.
   ``I was completely surprised,'' she said.
   McCallson, 20, of Hokah, called police. Word of her catch
quickly made news and reached Rollins, a retired Caledonia
construction worker who lost his limb about 13 years ago when a
loader tipped over.
   On Wednesday, he walked into the Houston County sheriff's office
and announced, ``Well, I'm the corpse that belonged to that arm.''
   ``That's just like winning the U.S. lottery,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A spy scandal that has rocked the
Foreign Ministry escalated Friday with the arrest of a fourth
official who allegedly passed secrets to East Germany's ousted
Communist rulers.
   The arrest, and others, have come with the help of a former
high-level German intelligence officer who is ``telling all,'' a
security official said on condition of anonymity. He gave no
further information on the East German.
   During the past month, five alleged East German agents have been
arrested. Four of them were with the foreign service and the fifth
worked for the federal border police.
   The security official said on condition of anonymity the string
of arrests is ``far from complete.''
   In the most recent case, a 59-year-old veteran diplomat with the
initials ``L.P.'' was arrested on suspicion of supplying secrets to
the East Germans for at least 15 years.
   Rolf Hannich, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in
Karlsruhe, said the suspect has been with the Foreign Ministry
since 1955. He said the diplomat held posts in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia; Liverpool, England; Edinburgh, Scotland; Palermo,
Italy; and Salzburg, Austria.
   Since 1987 he has worked at the Foreign Ministry in Bonn as a
specialist in international communications and transportation, and
international tourism.
   ``Since at least 1975 the suspect has obligated himself to
conduct intelligence activities for the Ministry of State
Security,'' said Hannich, referring to East Germany's intelligence
service. The service is being disbanded.
   The diplomat is suspected of delivering ``up to thisth of
documents and knowledge available to him baid Hannich.
   The information was delivered in personal meetings with East
Germans and by mail, Hannich said. He did not reveal what kind of
information was handed over.
   A day earlier, Hannich announced the arrest of a 54-year-old
foreign service official who had been posted in Sri Lanka, Egypt,
Japan, Britain and Austria.
   The arrests of two other diplomats _ one who had been posted at
NATO in Brussels, and the other at West Germany's UNESCO office in
Paris _ and of the federal border policeman were announced earlier
this month.
   All are suspected of having spi for East Germany over many years.
   The Hamburg-based Spiegel magazine identified the official
assigned to West Germany's NATO mission as Heinz-Helmuth Werner. It
said he had been paid by East German intelligence since 1969.
   According to the Spiegel report, Werner delivered more
classified information to tGermans and the Soviet KGB than East
German spyGuillaume.
   Guillaume was a top aide to then-Chancellor Willy Brandt. Brandt
resigned in 1974 after Guillauas unmasked. Guillaume was sentenced
to 13 years in prison in 1975 and six years later was traded in a
spy swap to East Germany, where he now lives.

   Bush administration officials said Friday they
would prod Japan to import more U.S. automotive parts, but refused
to say whether retaliatory action would be taken.
   Japanese automakers have shown no serious commitment to
increasing purchases of U.S. parts, despite recent announcements of
changes in their procurement system, said Mary A. Toman, deputy
assistant commerce secretary.
   Although the U.S. motor vehicle trade deficit with Japan has
narrowed slightly, the parts deficit continues to grow and hit
$10.5 billion in 1989, she said.
   ``Until there are significant increases in sales, we will not be
convinced that Japan truly has opened its markets to the world,''
Ms. Toman told the Senate subcommittee on innovation, technology
and productivity.
   Richard J. Roberts, whose Mount Clemens, Mich., company
manufactures molds for plastic auto parts, said his efforts to
break into foreign markets had been rebuffed.
   ``This is most discouraging to a company that wants to grow and
have the same opportunity their companies receive here in the
United States,'' Roberts said.
   Under a 1988 law , the administration can restrict imports from
countries that engage in unfair trading practices. The next round
of import restrictions is scheduled to be announced by the end of
the month.
   Ms. Toman and Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Don Phillips
declined to say whether Japanese auto parts would be on the list.
   Japanese and U.S. negotiators agreed on a plan April 5 to reduce
trade friction by making broad reforms in both countries'
economies. President Bush has praised Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu for promising vigorous efforts to open his nation's
markets.
   Ms. Toman said the Japanese had taken some steps toward
improving the situation, citing Toyota's plan to increase its
imports of parts 250 percent by 1992.
   Talks begun in 1986 helped boost U.S. auto parts exports to
Japan from $214 million that year to $638 million last year,
although the trade deficit widened at the same time, she said.

<HEAD>California Higher Education Chancellor Resigns Amid Pay-Raise
Furor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the 20-campus California
State University system abruptly resigned today at a special
meeting of the trustees, who then rolled back large pay raises she
had given herself and top executives.
   Chancellor Ann Reynolds, who heads the nation's largest
four-year and graduate-level university system, would have had her
annual salary rolled back $59,000, from $195,000 to $136,000.
   The trustees voted to cut salaries for 26 executives to last
July's levels, meaning college presidents will earn $110,000
instead of $145,000.
   A trustee subcommittee recommended the rollback Thursday after
taking testimony on raises that ranged from 43 percent for Reynolds
to 17 percent and 26 percent for deputies and college presidents.
   The raises sparked a furor in part because the salaries of the
best-paid professors at CSU campuses scattered around the state
rose only 4.8 percent.
   Committee members on Thursday focused their protests on the
process in which the raises were approved in private. Trustees, who
had delegated authority for salaries to Reynolds and board
Chairwoman Marianthi Lansdale, complained they were not consulted.
   Board members said they were kept in the dark about a
consultant's study of comparable higher education markets and
salaries commanded by their top executives.
   Reynolds, chancellor since 1982, said her resignation would be
effective Dec. 31, 1990, but she told trustees she intends to take
a leave of absence beginning Oct. 1 and become a professor in the
future.
   Before her resignation, Reynolds had apologized for the
controversy, but stood behind the salary raises. She said they were
years overdue, but that she failed to get that information out.
   ``I think I was remiss in recognizing the impact this would
have,'' Reynolds said at Thursday's meeting. ``I take
responsibility for it.''

<HEAD>Memo Warns Workloads Could `Overwhelm' Social Security System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration is seeing
warning signs of deteriorating service and rising workloads that
could ``overwhelm'' the system, a top agency official says in an
internal memo.
   ``There are signs of this early warning pattern developing in
all areas of SSA's basic operations,'' said the March memo to
Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King.
   Deputy Commissioner Herbert R. Doggette Jr. wrote the memo
shortly before he retired last month. He said both the numbers of
claims pending and the length of time needed to process them
increased in 1989.
   ``When this pattern appears, it is an early warning of
deterioration in levels of service,'' Doggette wrote.
   ``The possibility clearly exists that at some point workload
growth could overwhelm our ability to respond, given our limited
resources,'' the memo said.
   The memo, obtained Friday, was first described in a report in
The Washington Post.
   The number of claims pending at Social Security field offices
rose 4 percent in 1989, resulting in longer processing times for
three of four claims filed, Doggette reported. The number of cases
pending in the agency's six major service centers rose 14.3
percent, and processing times in the agency's Office of Disability
Operations rose 6 percent, the memo said.
   Staffing levels at the Social Security Administration were
slashed from 80,000 to 63,000 during the Reagan years as part of a
campaign to streamline and modernize the system. Many agency
employees have complained that the cuts left them overworked and
unable to provide good service to the public.
   Mrs. King, who took over the agency last August, this year has
dispatched ``strike teams'' to visit Social Security field offices
and approve hiring additional employees, paying overtime and
obtaining more equipment where needs are the greatest. She said
Friday the agency is adding about 500 workers.
   ``I'm confident now that, with the changes we made, by the end
of this fiscal year we will have our workloads well under
control,'' Mrs. King said.
   She added that with the recent release of $48 million by the
presidential Office of Management and Budget, ``We're fine where we
are right now. If I see that our workloads are increasing even
more, then we'll go back for even more.''
   Mrs. King said the administration's budget request of $4.2
billion for the Social Security Administration in the coming fiscal
year appeared adequate.
   However, seven senators on Friday sent a letter to members of
the Senate Appropriations Committee requesting an additional $120
million for 4,000 more employees.
   ``The results of understaffing can be devastating for our most
vulnerable citizens, such as poverty-stricken elderly, blind and
disabled recipients of Supplemental Security Income,'' the senators
wrote.
   The senators said demands on the Social Security Administration
could balloon next year due to a Supreme Court decision requiring
the agency to review an estimated 250,000 children for SSI
eligibility, and as 100,000 babies addicted to crack are born each
year who may qualify for SSI.
   ``From past experience, we all know how service delivery
problems can hurt public confidence in the Social Security
program,'' the senators wrote. ``We should act now to prevent
further erosion of confidence in this vital program.''

<HEAD>Crowded Asian Cities Face More Problems in Future, Says U.N.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The already crowded and polluted cities
of Asia face massive population increases that will exacerbate
their problems in the decades ahead, a U.N. study said Friday.
   Many of the world's largest cities will be in the Asia-Pacific
region by the year 2000, according to the report released in
Bangkok. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific will hold its 46th annual meeting of 48 nations in
the Thai capital June 4.
   Bombay, with 11.79 million and Shanghai, with 11.96 million, are
among the region's largest cities, said Mohammed Rahmatullah, chief
of the Human Settlement Unit of the commission.
   And with urban population growth at between 3 percent and 4
percent a year in the Asia-Pacific region, several other cities
will soon pass the 10 million mark, the report said. Jakarta,
Manila, Karachi, Tehran and Bangkok are all expected to top that
figure by the century's end, Rahmatullah said.
   Bombay is projected to have 16 million people, Shanghai 13.26
million, Jakarta 13.25, Karachi 12 million, Manila 11.07 million,
Bangkok 10.71 million and Tehran 10 million, Rahmatullah said.
   ``Migration to the metropolis will not ease in the foreseeable
future,'' the report said, pointing to higher salaries, more jobs,
and better health and education facilities in urban areas.
   Migration is exacerbating already pressing urban problems such
as pollution, slums, housing shortages, excessive traffic, and
shortages of water and electricity.
   Most Asian cities have slums. In some cities, 50 percent of the
population lives in shanties, squatter settlements or illegally
divided houses. Some slum communities are as big as cities, it said.
   The report called for new low-cost housing, land distribution,
and ``innovative financing'' to allow urban poor access to bank
loans.
   But urbanization is not an entirely ``negative force.'' Cities
contribute more than half a country's gross national product, the
report said.
   ``Economic development fuels urbanization and urbanization in
turn fuels other economic development,'' it said.
   The challenge for authorities is to promote economic growth and
at the same time find ways to solve urban problems, Rahmatullah
said.
   The commission recommends governments encourage settlement of
``secondary cities,'' set up factories near smaller cities, and
improve job opportunities and services in rural areas.

<HEAD>Forestry Section Included in Senate Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee responded to
concerns about global warming Friday by including a forestry
section in a farm bill for the first time.
   ``In light of the numerous issues that have developed pertaining
to forestry _ global warming, timber production, threatened and
endangered species, air and water quality _ it is time we
re-examine our commitment to state and private forestry and the
numerous owners of small, private forests,'' said Sen. Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga.
   Fowler is chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and
forests and comes from a state where small, privately held forest
acreage generates about $9 billion and provides 80,000 jobs.
   ``Including forestry in the farm bill underscores an important
fact,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the agriculture
committee. ``The total value of our timber harvests exceeds that of
any crop, including corn, soybeans, wheat and hay.''
   About half the timber used commercially in the United States
comes from the 482 million acres of private forests, most of which
grow wild. About 21 million acres are managed to assure certain
timber supplies are available.
   The national forests, which supply the rest of the nation's
timber, are carefully managed by the federal government.
   Leahy said one goal of the legislation is to put another 25
million acres of private forestland under management programs.
   The bill, which will be in the version of the 1990 farm bill
that goes to the full Senate, makes the most significant changes in
forestry laws in 14 years.
   It would:
   _Set up a public-private partnership with 8 million private
forest owners so the private sector could get technical assistance
already available to government foresters.
   _Establish an easement program through which the government
would buy development rights from forest owners to assure that
environmentally sensitive forestlands aren't threatened by
commercial building.
   _Create federal, state and local coordination committees to help
carry out the programs offered by the bill.
   Money for the programs would be determined later.
   The House has not acted on any similar legislation in the
version of the farm bill it is writing.

<HEAD>Heinz Calls for Census Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., is calling for
immediate Senate hearings on problems surrounding the 1990 census.
   ``The stakes are too high and the implications too far-ranging
for Congress not to take an active role in responding to the
problems,'' Heinz said Friday.
   His comment came only a day after a group of House members took
the Census Bureau to task.
   Mail-back response to the census has been slower than expected
and problems were experienced in getting forms delivered to 4.8
million people in several areas.
   This is being corrected, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant
told a House census subcommittee meeting on Thursday.
   She said the accuracy of the count is not in danger. But she
estimated it will cost at least $100 million more than originally
planned to count people who haven't responded by mail.
   Subcommittee chairman Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, said the cost
overrun could be $150 million or more, and others have put the
figure as high as $190 million.
   The 1990 census is expected to cost a total of $2.5 billion,
with $1.3 billion being spent this year.
   Although the bureau has not yet begun its detailed door-to-door
effort to count people who did not respond by mail, several House
members expressed concern that the final count will be inaccurate.
   ``I think we are facing a crisis,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
D-Calif., who has been pressing for establishment of local census
coordinators to be appointed by each member of Congress.
   Democratic national chairman Ron Brown said Thursday that the
possibility of adjusting the final numbers to account for those who
are overlooked should be considered.
   The Commerce Department, parent of the Census Bureau, has
resisted the idea of adjusting the final figures, but says it is
still considering the possibility.
   Heinz's call for a hearing on Census problems came in a letter
to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, head of the Governmental Affairs
Committee.

<HEAD>50,000 March in Manhattan to Protest Bias Against Haitians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 loosely organized marchers
converged on lower Manhattan today, closing the Brooklyn Bridge to
protest a federal AIDS policy they say discriminates against
Haitians.
   By early afternoon, traffic was badly snarled, even by Manhattan
standards.
   ``The Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and all local streets in
the area of lower Manhattan, City Hall and Federal Plaza are
rapidly going to be gridlocked,'' Fred Feldman, spokesman for the
city Department of Transportation, said.
   Lt. Ray O'Donnell, a police spokesman who provided the crowd
estimate, said a lack of organization and leadership among the
marchers created the traffic disruption.
   The march was called to protest a Food and Drug Administration
policy prohibiting anyone who has emigrated from Haiti from giving
blood, as a precaution against spreading AIDS.
   Dr. Joel L. Solomon, director of the FDA's Division of Blood and
Blood products, said emigres from Haiti and some African countries
are excluded because the AIDS-related virus is so widespread there.
Also, AIDS is transmitted largely through heterosexual activity in
those countries, meaning that the immigrants would not be covered
by the FDA ban on blood donations by men who have had homosexual
contacts.
   The immigrants from the countries affected are mostly black, and
some have charged racism.
   One of the protesters carried a sign reading, ``Let's Fight
AIDS, Not Nationality.''

<HEAD>Parliament Debates Path Toward German Unity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's new parliament on Friday
debated the path toward unity with its rich Western neighbor in a
session that highlighted fears about the impact of the planned
merger.
   In an interview to be published Saturday, East Germany's finance
minister, Walter Romberg, warned that 70 percent of the country's
factories would need huge support or would not survive economic
union.
   And the chief of the former Communist Party criticized the
government's plan for unity and said it would allow West Germany to
colonize East Germany.
   At the parliamentary session, lawmakers united behind Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere's desire for East Germany's currency to
be valued at the same rate as the mighty West German mark. But
differences quickly emerged over the speed of reunification.
   Taking advantage of the newly found freedom of protest, the
reformed Communist Party walked out of the chamber after a member
of an arch-conservative party likened the communists to the
hard-liners who ruled East Germany 40 years.
   The arc-conservative, Joachim Hubertus Nowack of the German
Social Union, compared the ousted government to the Nazi
dictatorship that preceded it.
   The Farmers' Party, one of the many factions in the 400-seat
parliament, threatened a blockade of openings in the crumbling
inter-German border if agricultural markets were threatened by a
flood of imports during the moves toward a market economy.
   Gregor Gysi, who took over the battered Communist Party and
oversaw its name change to the Party for Social Democracy, urged a
slow merger and said East Germans must have a chance to ``go
upright into unification.''
   He said the constitutions of both Germanys should be abolished
and a new series of laws written for a united nation.
   Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl rejected this with the comment:
``No more socialist experiments.''
   The coalition government led by de Maiziere has proposed that
East Germany adopt the existing West German constitution.
   Wolfgang Thierse of the left-leaning Social Democrats, who
advocated the slower process before it joined the government
coalition, said the quick route is the ``realistic way'' to unity.
   But he said the Social Democrats would ``fight'' for revisions
to the constitution to include the right to housing, employment and
education currently laid down in basic East German law.
   The chairman of West Germany's Social Democrats, Hans-Jochen
Vogel also cautioned against rapid unification.
   ``It would be terrible if we made mistakes because we proceeded
too quickly. Mistakes that the people must put right again,'' Vogel
told reporters. He was visiting East Berlin for the parliament
session and a meeting with de Maiziere.
   In an effort to calm fears about massive unemployment, de
Maziere said Friday that planned tax incentives and new investment
laws would help create 500,000 new jobs in middle-sized enterprises
this year. That would compensate for job losses in large state
concerns.
   In an interview in Saturday's edition of the West German ``Neue
Westfaelische'' newspaper, finance minister Romberg was quoted as
saying only 30 percent of East Germany's industrial concerns could
handle competition in a free market economy.
   He said that 20 percent would survive only with ``very heavy
capital expenditure'' while 50 percent needed ``a lot of
investment.'' The text of the article was released in advance to
other news media.

<HEAD>AP, British Media Ordered to Give Riot Film to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press, two British news agencies
and a television company must hand over all film of a March 31 riot
in London that left about 580 people injured, a judge ruled Friday.
   At a hearing in the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court, Judge
Neil Denison granted the police application. He rejected arguments
that freedom of the press is paramount.
   He said the right of the press to report freely and the need to
trace serious offenders clashed and one had to give way.
   ``There are two conflicting areas of public interest,'' Denison
said. ``They have to be weighed and balanced one against the other,
and in a sense they are irreconcilable.''
   The AP, the British domestic news agency Press Association, and
London Weekend Television opposed the application on grounds it
made them appear an arm of the police and endangered their
photographers.
   The fourth organization, Fleet Street News Agency, made no
objection.
   ``If applications routinely succeed, there is a loss of the
perceived independence of the media,'' Robin Oppenheim, legal
counsel for the three news organizations, told the court.
   Police had sought help from news organizations in identifying
those who participated in the riot that engulfed Trafalgar Square
and London's theater district. The riot broke out after a
demonstration against a new tax.
   Britain's 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act allows a judge
to order news media to turn over material in the case of serious
offenses.
   On April 6, Denison ordered 25 British newspapers and TV
companies to turn over their film to help identify rioters. Police
then asked for film held by news agencies and London Weekend
Television.
   The order, which the judge is to sign Monday, means the AP and
Press Association must give police all negatives of the riot.
   But the judge said the AP, Press Association and London Weekend
Television were right to oppose the application.
   ``Orders such as this should not be made as a matter of
course,'' he said.
   ``It would be wrong if the media were to back down and concede
every application that is made,'' he said. ``They are perfectly
entitled to come to court and put their arguments.''
   The violence broke out after demonstrators tried to storm Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office. They then
attacked police and rampaged across London's West End.
   Nearly 500 police officers and 86 civilians were injured, and
hundreds of shops were looted and cars burned.

   Two Republican senators proposed a
constitutional amendment on Friday to overturn a Supreme Court
ruling that local government officials could be ordered to increase
property taxes to finance school desegregation.
   The 5-4 high court ruling on Wednesday involved a Kansas City,
Mo., school desegregation case.
   Sens. John Danforth and Christopher Bond, both Missouri
Republicans, introduced the proposed amendment, which states:
``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the United
States shall have the power to instruct or order a state or
political subdivision thereof, or an official of such state or
political subdivision, to lay or increase taxes.''
   Ratification of a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds
majority approval by the House and Senate and then must be ratified
by three-fourths of the states.
   Danforth, in a statement, said he viewed the Supreme Court
decision as empowering federal judges to personally impose taxes
and contended that the Constitution gave the power of taxation
exclusively to the legislative branch.
   ``That decision flatly contradicts a fundamental premise of
American democracy which predates the Constitution itself,''
Danforth said.

   Lithuania's prime minister came to the
heartland of Norway's petroleum industry Friday and suggested a
trade of farm products for oil to help the Baltic republic survive
a Soviet energy blockade.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, asked about reports Soviet
soldiers stormed a printing plant and beat civilian guards in
Vilnius, denounced the Soviets.
   ``It's not so easy for the Soviet army to provoke conflicts and
clashes, although it is often clear that this is their aim,'' Mrs.
Prunskiene told reporters.
   ``We can only say that these clashes are very unpleasant, but
the situation ... has happened before,'' she said.
   She also said she had been told by Lithuanian authorities in
Vilnius that a trip she planned to the United States and Canada at
the end of April had been canceled, apparently to avoid a conflict
with the U.S.-Soviet summit set to begin May 30.
   ``I got the idea that my trip was too close to the summit
meeting in America, but I'm not sure this is why the trip was
postponed,'' she said after receiving a cable from the Foreign
Ministry in Vilnius.
   The Soviet Union, trying to prod Lithuania to recant on
secessionist moves, has cut off crude oil supplies and most of its
natural gas supply.
   Mrs. Prunskiene came to this west coast oil town to meet
managers of the government Statoil company. The company has said it
is ready to sell oil to Lithuania on a normal commercial basis.
   The Norwegian government told the Lithuanians they are welcome
to buy its North Sea crude, but it has given no promises of aid or
credit.
   Mrs. Prunskiene suggested that Lithuania and Norway could trade
agricultural products and other products for oil, though ``we don't
know if Norway is interested in buying our products.''
   ``It would be natural for those who buy oil to also pay for it.
But our situation is different. As you know, the hard currency has
always been taken from Lithuania to Moscow,'' she told reporters.
   The Soviet embargo ``means the time has come in Lithuania ... to
find new sources of oil deliveries and look to other countries,''
she said. ``This looking for new possibilities may start in this
city.''
   Norway, which pumps 1.5 million barrels a day from North Sea oil
fields, is the second-largest oil exporter outside the OPEC oil
cartel. It also produces natural gas but has no way to deliver it
to Lithuania.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said her delegation would explore the
possibility of refining Norwegian crude oil in Lithuania, though it
would take several months to set up an infrastructure to transport
the oil to the refinery.
   She said the small republic, which lacks hard currency, would
seek foreign markets for dairy produce and other farm products
previously sold through Soviet authorities. In exchange, Lithuania
gets energy supplies at below-market rates.
   ``If the Soviets cut off oil deliveries, it's natural that
Lithuania will answer with its own coin,'' she said.
   Lithuania also would seek export credits, which she said would
not necessarily have to be given by the exporting country.
   The delegation leaves Norway on Saturday for Denmark. It made
hasty arrangements for a stop in Sweden on Sunday before returning
home.

   Republican National Committee chairman Lee
Atwater returned home Friday after a one-day hospital stay, an RNC
spokeswoman said.
   ``It was one of a series of routine examinations'' Atwater must
have as part of therapy for a brain tumor, said Mary Matalin,
Atwater's chief of staff. The tumor was found last month.
   In New York earlier this month, surgeons implanted radioactive
isotopes in the tumor in an effort to kill it. The isotopes were
removed after several days.
   Atwater also has been receiving physical therapy and undergoing
daily radiation treatments.
   Physicians have described the tumor as aggressive.
   Matalin said Atwater, who has had difficulty walking, entered
George Washington University Medical Center on Thursday for a
``routine leg scan.'' He returned home by noon Friday, she said.
   The Washington Post had reported that Atwater was hospitalized
after experiencing ``renewed weakness'' on the left side of his
body.

   The Israeli air force mounted its third
raid on Lebanon in two days Friday, blasting strongholds of
pro-Iranian fundamentalists in the western Bekaa Valley, police
reported.
   They said four helicopter gunships fired 12 air-to-ground
rockets into the village of Ein al-Tineh, three miles northeast of
Israel's self-designated security zone.
   Police said there was no immediate report of casualties from the
village. It is controlled by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, whose guerrillas have frequently raided the Israeli-held
enclave.
   The air strike lasted five minutes. On Thursday, Israeli
fighter-bombers twice raided a tunnel complex used by Syrian-backed
Palestian guerrillas above the coastal town of Naameh south of
Beirut. Two people were wounded.
   The new raid raised the number of Israel's air assaults on
targets in Lebanon to 12 this year. A total of 10 people have been
killed and 31 wounded.

<HEAD>Friends Rally for Handyman Held in Booby-Trap Killing at Warehouse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handyman accused of setting a shotgun booby trap
that killed an intruder in his frequently burglarlized warehouse
was ordered held Friday while authorities decide whether to
prosecute him for murder.
   Denver District Attorney Norm Early said hundreds of callers had
offered unsolicited advice ranging from ``give the man a medal, to
hang him.'' Friends of Philip Connaghan, who surrendered Thursday,
say they have received offers of help for him.
   Connaghan, who was in Kansas when the youth was killed, appeared
before Denver County Court Judge Larry Bohning, who ordered him
held without bond for investigation of first-degree murder.
Prosecutors have until Tuesday to file formal charges.
   Michael McComb, 19, of Denver, was shot in the chest late
Saturday while leading three juveniles in an apparent burglary
attempt at the downtown warehouse. The three juveniles, who were
booked for investigation of burglary and released to their parents,
told police they were looking for adventure.
   Police said the shotgun that killed McComb was attached to a
trip wire they believe Connaghan rigged at the warehouse, which has
been burglarized of his tools eight times since 1987. The front
door of the warehouse bore the inscription: ``Danger _ Enter at own
risk.''
   Tim McComb, father of the slain youth, declined comment, other
than to say, ``I'd just as soon let it be.''
   The mother of one of the unidentified youths told The Denver
Post: ``They were talked into doing this. It's quite devastating.
Our kid got led into something he shouldn't have gotten led into.''
   Early has said Colorado's ``Make-My-Day'' law, which allows
people to use deadly force to defend themselves in their homes,
probably does not apply. The law was nicknamed after a line from a
Clint Eastwood movie. Friends of the 46-year-old Connaghan,
meanwhile, have rallied to his defense. They began taking up a
collection Friday to replace his tools and provide legal fees.
   Kevin Corbin, owner of the nearby Skyline Cafe, said he's
received calls from across the country offering to help raise the
$10,000 lawyers have demanded for his legal fees.
   ``People here support Connaghan 100 percent,'' Corbin said.
   ``He put bars on the windows, put up steel doors and even welded
them shut and he couldn't keep the burglars out. He even had a
danger sign on the front, saying enter at your own risk, and that
didn't keep them out.''
   Connaghan lost more than $7,000 in tools during a burglary last
July. The warehouse also holds auto parts, acetylene torches and
truck camper shells.
   ``Nearly everyone here has had their cars broken into or their
houses broken into, and they're just fed up,'' said Corbin.
``Police wouldn't do anything about it, or couldn't do anything
about it. They couldn't just stop their patrols to guard one
building.
   ``Something's wrong, maybe it's the whole system. But people are
fed up and so far, all of the callers are saying it's time we did
something about it. I haven't had one person say they thought it
was wrong,'' Corbin said.
   Corbin said Connaghan often brought his granddaughter to the
restaurant while he drank coffee.
   ``He'd give you the shirt off his back, and I'm sorry to see him
go to jail for people who took everything he owned,'' he said. ``If
he goes to the penitentiary for this, crime will just go up in the
area because criminals will know they can get by with a slap on the
wrist.''

<TEXT>
   Two Republican senators proposed a
constitutional amendment on Friday to overturn a Supreme Court
ruling that local government officials could be ordered to increase
property taxes to finance school desegregation.
   The 5-4 high court ruling on Wednesday involved a Kansas City,
Mo., school desegregation case.
   Sens. John Danforth and Christopher Bond, both Missouri
Republicans, introduced the proposed amendment, which states:
``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the United
States shall have the power to instruct or order a state or
political subdivision thereof, or an official of such state or
political subdivision, to lay or increase taxes.''
   Ratification of a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds
majority approval by the House and Senate and then must be ratified
by three-fourths of the states.
   Danforth, in a statement, said he viewed the Supreme Court
decision as empowering federal judges to personally impose taxes
and contended that the Constitution gave the power of taxation
exclusively to the legislative branch.
   ``That decision flatly contradicts a fundamental premise of
American democracy which predates the Constitution itself,''
Danforth said.

   About two dozen foreign correspondents were back
in Lithuania on Friday _ but only for a few days, on a trip
organized by the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
   The Soviet government expelled virtually all foreign
correspondents from Lithuania on April 1 under threat of losing
their accreditation in the Soviet Union.
   No explanation was given for that order, or for the special
Foreign Ministry-sponsored trip. About 20 to 25 journalists who
were given permission to stay in Lithuania until Sunday.
   The trip came just as Moscow cut oil and gas supplies to the
Baltic republic in its latest attempt to force Lithuania into
rescinding its March 11 declaration of independence.
   Journalists said it appears that the small Lithuanian Communist
Party faction loyal to Moscow was behind the trip, hoping to win
coverage of its party congress Saturday. This group has
orchestrated the intimidation tactics of Soviet troops, including
the occupation of public buildings in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius.
   The Moscow loyalists seemed unhappy when some of the journalists
arriving in Vilnius on Thursday night immediately left their care
to cover the story of the Kremlin embargo.
   Most correspondents were too busy to consider the party leaders'
offer of a city tour Friday.
   But several attended a news conference where the Communist
group's leader, Vladislav Schved, repeated his demands for
imposition of presidential rule. That could include martial law and
dissolution of the parliament that so infuriates him.
   Other journalists went to a briefing with military officers.
   On Saturday, the party's congress faces major competition for
the journalists' attention. On the same day, the pro-independence
movement Sajudis will hold its own congress, and it claims more
than 10 times the Schved group's 35,000 members.
   Journalists said Soviet officials have not interfered with their
work. But all must leave on Sunday and the republic remains
off-limits for regular travel.
   Participation on this week's trip was restricted, but apparently
arbitrarily. The New York Times, The Washington Post and Cable News
Network all asked to go and were told they were not included on the
trip.
   All also requested permission to travel to Vilnius on their own
simultaneously with the Foreign Ministry excursion. They were
denied permission.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said Friday
that chances for a ``fair and honest dialogue'' with breakaway
Lithuania were improved by the Soviet parliament's adoption of
legislation implementing the constitutional right to secede.
   But Dubinin repeated the Kremlin's position that the next step
toward dialogue cannot be taken until Lithuania withdraws its
unilateral declaration of independence and enters talks based on
the Soviet Constitution and the new Soviet law of secession.
   ``I would like to say once more that the Soviet government would
like nothing more than to settle this problem by an open and honest
dialogue,'' Dubinin told reporters at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``There would be no one in the globe more interested in this
than we are,'' he said.
   Because of the adoption of the new law, he said, ``the
conditions are now there to go forward in the spirit of perestroika
and the rule of law.''
   Meanwhile, at the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said Secretary of State James A. Baker III raised the
issue of Lithuania at a meeting on arms control issues with Dubinin
and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov.
   Baker restated the U.S. position that the independence crisis in
Lithuania should be resolved peacefully and that a process should
be started leading to dialogue, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said the United States continues to consult with its allies
on the situation in Lithuania.
   The United States has declared that reprisals can be expected if
the Kremlin uses force or coercion to force Lithuania into line.
   Dubinin said he had seen no sign the Lithuanians were willing to
begin a dialogue on the terms spelled out by Moscow.
   ``At the present time I have no indication of their willingness
to do so,'' he said.
   ``Until now, the Lithuanians do not accept this element,'' he
said. ``The answer has to be given by Vilnius,'' the Lithuanian
capital.
   The new Soviet law of secession calls for independence to be
ratified by a two-thirds majority in a referendum. Such a vote
would be followed by a five-year transition period.
   Responding to a question, Dubinin said that while it is true the
Soviets have sharply reduced the flow of natural gas into Lithuania
in an attempt to force the withdrawal of the Lithuanian
parliament's independence decree, gas is still reaching the country
``at the level necessary to assure each day's needs of the
population.''
   ``It is at a lower level, but sufficient to assure normal
life,'' he said.
   Moscow completely cut off oil supplies to Lithuania on Wednesday
night.
   Dubinin spoke during ceremonies in which he accepted a gift on
behalf of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The gift, a large cross fabricated of black walnut and bronze,
was presented by officials of Architectural Metalwork Inc., of
Tarpon Springs, Fla., to show support for Gorbachev's policies of
democratization, expanded free enterprise and increased religious
freedom.
   The cross bears the Russian word ``Mir'' meaning ``Peace.''
   Pat Shrader, one of the owners of the company, said she and her
associates thought it was important that a message of support for
Gorbachev's policies come from ``just grass roots and non-famous
people.''
   ``Our individual lives are degraded or improved by the
conditions surrounding us,'' she told Dubinin, saying the group's
wish for Gorbachev is ``wisdom and success.''

<TEXT>
   A radical reform economist, Gavriil Popov, was
elected Moscow's mayor Friday by the new city council, the official
Tass news agency reported.
   The city council was dominated by reformers in recent elections,
which were the first multi-candidate elections for local
representative bodies in the Soviet Union.
   The split between progressives and their opponents on the
council was reflected in the 280-162 vote for Popov. He has
captured national attention for his leadership of the country's
first parliamentary opposition group, the progressive InterRegional
Group of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Soviet officials are allowed to hold two elected posts
simultaneously.
   The election of the 54-year-old reformer portends drastic change
for the Soviet capital, which has fallen into extreme disrepair
under decades of neglect. He strongly supports a market economy and
has suggested rationing during the transition period to allocate
scarce items fairly.
   In a nationally televised speech in December, Popov harshly
criticized Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov's economic reform plan for
continuing central planning for five more years. He noted it went
so far into micro-management as to set the number of eggs to be
produced per person.
   Popov suggested that if bureaucrats want to increase egg
production, they should raise chickens.
   Popov is a member of the Communist Party, but as a supporter of
the Democratic Platform wing he is in danger of being ousted by
hard-liners.

<HEAD>Inventories Up 1 Percent in Last Year</HEAD>

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 10.1 million head as of April 1, up 1
percent from a year ago and 4 percent more than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Officials said it was the largest April 1 feedlot inventory of
cattle since 1978. Nebraska was No. 1, edging Texas, the usual
leader.
   Increases from a year ago were reported in Iowa, Kansas,
Nebraska, Oklahoma and Washington. California and Minnesota were
unchanged. Decreases were reported for Arizona, Colorado, Idaho,
Illinois, South Dakota and Texas.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during January, February
and March totaled 5.58 million head, down 1 percent from the same
period of 1989 and 5 percent below 1988, the report said.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the first
quarter of the year totaled 6.09 million head, down 2 percent from
1989 but 5 percent more than in 1988.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 6.09 million head
during April, May and June, up 1 percent from last year's second
quarter and 4 percent more than in 1988, the report said. It would
also be the same number as feedlot placements in the first quarter.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of April
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   The government posted a $53.34 billion budget
deficit in March _ a monthly record _ pushing the imbalance past
the Gramm-Rudman 1990 target in just six months, the Treasury
Department reported Friday.
   The March gap between spending and revenues produced a deficit
of $150.85 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 17.5
percent more than the $128.4 billion imbalance during the first
half of 1989.
   Revenues last month were down 4.9 percent from March 1989 to
$64.82 billion, while spending rose 13.6 percent to $118.16 billion.
   The $53.34 billion difference was the widest monthly gap since a
$39.4 billion imbalance was posted in May 1986, according to James
Blum, assistant director of the Congressional Budget Office.
   Louis Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson of New York,
said the deficit so far this year points to a return to $200
billion imbalances that existed until recently.
   Crandall attributed most of the March deficit to Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. payments, spending by the Resolution Trust Corp. to
bail out failed savings and loans, expedited income tax refunds as
a result of electronic filing systems and Federal Reserve losses
because of the falling value of its foreign currency reserves.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law set a target of $100
billion for the total fiscal 1990 deficit. But the law sets no
pentalities if the actual deficit ends up exceeding the target, an
eventuality that has occurred every year since Gramm-Rudman was
enacted in 1985.
   The Bush administration budget last January estimated the 1990
deficit to be $123.8 billion. The Congressional Budget Office in
March projected the deficit would be $159 billion.
   For the six-month period, revenues totaled $458.29 billion, up
3.9 percent from the first six months of 1989. Spending totaled
$609.15 billion, a 6.98 percent increase.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories in March were for the
military, Social Security and other programs in the Department of
Health and Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $28.69 billion in March and $145.47
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.79 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $20.33 billion for the
month and $119.38 billion for the year so far. They are expected to
total $244.59 billion for the year.
   Other HHS programs including Medicare and Medicaid totaled
$17.40 billion in March and $191.17 billion for the year.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $17.54 billion during
February and $254.85 billion for the year.

<TEXT>
   The Chinese Communist Party said in a rare public
release of a major internal document Friday that it must resist
``the corrosive influence of the decaying ideologies'' to maintain
close ties with the people.
   The pledge belied the party's deep anxiety over its ability to
continue its 41-year rule over the world's most populous nation in
the wake of plunging public support.
   ``The danger of alienation from the masses may spring up if the
party ... does not use its power properly and consciously resist
the corrosive influence of the decaying ideologies of the
bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes,'' said the document. It
was approved by a party Central Committee meeting last month and
issued via the official Xinhua News Agency.
   ``The rise or fall of the party and the state depends on whether
flesh-and-blood ties with the masses can be maintained and
developed,'' the Central Committee document said.
   Central Committee documents are rarely made public, and the
release of this one appeared intended to dramatize the seriousness
of the party's repeated calls for tightening discipline, rooting
out corruption and improving its public relations.
   The Communists, who took power in 1949 with widespread support,
lost some popularity in the 1950s with forced collectivization and
in the 1960s with the violent, far-leftist Cultural Revolution. But
public disillusionment and cynicism have reached a new high since
the leadership used the army in June to put down pro-democracy
protesters, killing hundreds and possibly thousands.
   The fall of hard-line Communist governments in East Europe and
ethnic clashes on the edges of this vast nation, most recently in
the Moslem west, have further undermined the party's stature.
   ``Our party and state are presently at a crucial period of
historical development,'' it said. ``Unhealthy tendencies such as
bureaucracy ... and individualism, and corruptive practices such as
seeking personal gain through abuse of power, have emerged among
some party cadres in recent years.
   ``We must resolutely rid all malpractices that cut us off from
the masses ... (and) boost our party's cohesive force and fighting
power,'' it ordered.
   Among other things, the document told party officials to ``go
deep down to the grass roots'' and take part in production so as to
learn problems first-hand. They should ``shun formalism ... Mix
with the masses, treat them as equals, be willing to learn from
them and avoid putting on airs,'' it said.
   Party officials must not use public funds to hold banquets and
must refuse gifts, it added. In recent years, bribes have become an
implicitly accepted part of doing business in China.
   The orders invoked the spirit of the revolutionary era, when
Communist soldiers were famous for helping the peasants and not
taking anything in return. Since last year's protests, the party's
aging leaders have spoken nostalgically of that era and the wartime
virtues of austere living, personal sacrifice and patriotism.
   The document said leading officials who hold themselves aloof
and ``evoke dissatisfaction from the masses'' should be fired, but
it did not name anyone. One of China's least popular officials is
Premier Li Peng, who signed the order imposing martial law in
Beijing last year during the protests.
   There was speculation he might be removed to placate the public,
but at the recent annual session of China's legislature he appeared
firmly in power.
   The document, reflecting senior leader Deng Xiaoping's policy of
allowing ``small democracy,'' said party officials should listen to
the opinions of ordinary people and not retaliate against criticism.
   But it made clear that ``big democracy'' _ pluralism and an end
to absolute party control _ is not under consideration.
   Instead, it ordered an increase in Marxist education, closer
supervision of the party's 18 million members, tightened discipline
and absolute obedience to central party officials.

   Concealing covert government operations from
legitimate congressional inquiries poses a danger to democracy,
Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said Friday.
   In a speech at the University of Oklahoma, Walsh said ``the need
for truth in important human affairs ... is critically needed for
the checks and balances of our Constitution.''
   When the Reagan administration's secret Contra and Iran
initiatives were threatened with exposure in 1986, ``disturbingly,
the reaction ... among some of our most sophisticated intelligence
operatives and superiors were not unlike those of more
simple-minded conspirators,'' said Walsh.
   ``First some lied separately. Then some lied in concert. Then
some destroyed documents and notes.''
   The independent counsel has been investigating the scandal since
December 1986. He obtained the conviction of former national
security adviser John Poindexter on five felony charges April 7.
Poindexter was found guilty of covering up from Congress Oliver
North's secret Contra resupply operation and the U.S. role in a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. North is appealing
his conviction of last year on three felonies in the affair.
   ``The obstruction by some administration officials of legitimate
congressional inquiries ... illuminates the need for the rule of
law to function in the sphere of covert government activities,''
said Walsh.
   He said ``the claim that congressional inquiries into
intelligence activities might be answered by lies has been rejected
by two district judges and two juries.''
   The need for secrecy is increasing to meet threats to U.S.
security, said Walsh. But that means ``an ever-higher premium must
be placed by Congress and the public on the truthfulness of
executive branch officials'' who conduct covert operations.
   Walsh said Reagan administration officials covered up North's
Contra supply network because ``truthful responses ... would have
invited ... legislative actions designed to end all secret support
to the Contras.''
   The prosecutor said the Iran arms sales presented ``an even more
dangerous threat of hostile congressional reaction'' because the
Reagan administration's ``proclaimed ... policy'' was that the U.S.
``would not pay ransom for hostages.''

   More Japanese than American companies ranked
among the top 10 recipients of U.S. patents in 1989, the Commerce
Department said Friday.
   Half of the top 10 spots went to Japanese firms and four of
those companies outranked any American company, the department's
Patent and Trademark Office said.
   Three U.S. companies were in the top 10 for the fiscal year
which ended last September 30.
   The largest number of patents went to Japan's Hitachi Corp.,
marking the fourth year in a row that a Japanese company has
occupied the top position.
   Hitachi, which received 1,053 patents, was followed by three
other Japanese companies in the top spots. Toshiba received 961
patents; Canon, 949, and Fuji Photo Film had 884.
   General Electric Co., which had held the top spot from 1969
until 1986, was the top American company on the list with 818
patents, dropping to fifth place from fourth last year.
   Other American companies in the top 10 were International
Business Machines Corp., No. 9 with 623 patents, and Eastman Kodak
in tenth place with 589 patents.
   Other foreign companies in the top 10 were Japan's Mitsubishi
Denki in sixth place with 767 patents; U.S. Philips Corp., the
subsidiary of a Dutch firm, in seventh place with 745 patents, and
the German manufacturing firm Seimens in eighth place with 656
patents.
   U.S. industrial experts have said the trend of foreign
companies, especially the Japanese, dominating U.S. patents is
another demonstration that American companies are not adequately
investing in the research and development necessary to keep the
United States competitive in overseas markets in coming years.
   The patent office said it issued a record 102,712 patents in
1989, a 23 percent increase from the 83,584 patents issued in 1988.
   While foreigners obtained almost half of all patents issued last
year, the percentage was down slightly from 1988. In 1989,
foreigners received 46.7 percent of all U.S. patents, compared to
47.3 percent in 1988.

<HEAD>East Europeans Jam Yugoslav Borders After New Currency Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia on Friday began requiring
East Europeans to change about $200 in Western money to Yugolslav
currency, a move that virtually closes its borders to former
Communist neighbors.
   Thousands of Romanians, Bulgarians, Soviets and other East
Europeans clogged border crossings early Friday, hoping to cross
before the measures took effect, according to reports.
   Yugoslav television showed hundreds of cars, some waiting more
than 12 hours, at the Vatin border crossing with Romania. Quarrels
and occasional fist-fights broke out between customs officials and
impatient travelers.
   Starting Friday, East European and Soviet citizens entering
Yugoslavia through its borders with Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria,
had to change the equivalent of $200 in Western currencies to
Yugoslav dinars.
   Many Eastern Europeans do not generally possess convertible
Western currency.
   Officially, the strict money policy was introduced to prevent
East Europeans from bringing in large quantities of cheap goods
without paying import duties and selling them at Yugoslav flea
markets.
   The Borba daily, however, said the measure was introduced after
Western nations suggested Yugoslavia ``should become a filter
zone'' for East Europeans seeking asylum in the West.
   The shortest road from Romania and Bulgaria to Austria and Italy
is through Yugoslavia.
   Over the past two years, thousands of East Europeans have poured
into Yugoslavia selling tools, canned foods, spare parts for
Soviet-built cars, household utensils and other items at cut-rate
prices.
   The influx of East Europeans increased markedly this year after
the dinar became freely convertible. This made Yugoslavia a
particularly attractive venue for East Europeans who in their own
countries find it hard to get their hands on large amounts of hard
currency.
   In Yugoslavia, after selling their wares for dinars, they can
easily exchange the currency for U.S. dollars or West German marks.

   Four blacks died in factional
fighting and in clashes with police who fired tear gas and shotguns
to break up demonstrations, police said Friday.
   A police statement said the four were killed in Natal Province
over the previous 24 hours, including a youth killed when police
fired on a crowd that attacked officers with firebombs and rocks.
   President F.W. de Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town the unrest
was damaging his efforts to launch negotiations on a new
constitution. Violence has killed more than 600 blacks this year.
   ``Constitutional development through the swing of a panga
(machete) cannot be obtained,'' de Klerk said. ``I call on all
responsible leaders ... (to) use their influence and disciplinary
powers to ensure that the violence comes to an end.''
   The police statement said officers used shotguns, pistols,
rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters in several
areas. Police gave few details, but said clashes erupted when
crowds attacked vehicles or homes belonging to black police
officers.
   Police Commissioner Lt. Gen. Johan van der Merwe said Friday an
investigation would be made into a shooting Thursday near the
central town of Viljoenskrron that left five black youths dead.
   The African National Congress, the black political organization,
denounced Thursday's killings.
   ``This is disgusting behavior on the part of the police and we
protest most strongly against the killings,'' said ANC leader
Walter Sisulu.
   Police said five police officers fired on a crowd of about 200
blacks protesting rents and other local problems. Four youths, age
13 to 16, died Thursday. A fifth died in a hospital on Friday,
local residents said.
   Youths erected street barricades, set houses afire and threw
stones at police in the same area Friday. Officers responded with
tear gas, but no injuries or arrests were reported.
   The ANC pulled out of peace talks with the white government last
month after police killed at least 11 black protesters March 26 in
Sebokeng, a township south of Johannesburg. De Klerk ordered an
inquiry into the incident. The ANC later agreed to reschedule talks
with the government May 2-4 to try to clear the way for full-scale
negotiations on ending white-minority rule. The ANC wants an end to
a state of emergency as a precondition for full talks.
   De Klerk pledged major changes Thursday in remaining apartheid
laws as part of his plan for a new constitution that would include
blacks for the first time. However, he reiterated his opposition to
black majority rule, saying it would lead to domination of the
whites.
   South Africa has 5 million whites, 28 million blacks, about 3
million colored (mixed race), and 850,000 Asians and Indians.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Says Moscow Plans Total Withdrawal From Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has assured Vietnam that all
Soviet troops will be out of the Asian nation by 1992, a senior
member of the House Armed Services Committee said Friday.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who headed a seven-member
congressional delegation that visited the Western Pacific and
Southeast Asia last week, issued a report that described Soviet
intentions in Vietnam and discussed U.S. bases overseas.
   ``Vietnam Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told the delegation
that all Soviet troops would be out of Vietnam by 1992,'' Schroeder
said in the 44-page report. ``This is good news.''
   The Soviet Union moved into the U.S.-built base at Cam Ranh Bay
at the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975, but Pentagon
officials said in January that the Soviets had withdrawn some
fighter planes and bombers.
   In an interview with reporters, Schroeder said the Soviets no
longer are basing their planned withdrawal from Cam Rahn Bay on
whether the United States remains at the Subic Naval Base in the
Philippines as they have said previously.
   Leases on six U.S. installations in the Philippines expire in
1991 and American officials anticipate difficult negotiations for
continued base rights there.
   The Colorado congresswoman also said Thach disputed recent
reports that the Vietnamese would allow the United States to use
Cam Rahn Bay as a military base.
   ``The Vietnamese have no interest in permitting the United
States to use Cam Rahn Bay,'' Schroeder said the foreign minister
told the group.
   ``He said that nations with friendship agreements with Vietnam
could ask to use the facilities. And, he hopes that Vietnam and the
United States could in the future commence friendly relations.''
   Earlier this month, Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., said Vietnamese
officials privately suggested allowing the U.S. military to return
to the base if relations between the countries continued to warm.
   Ridge met with Vietnamese officials during an Indonesia forum
sponsored by the Henry R. Luce Foundation and attended by several
lawmakers and a group of top-ranking officials of Vietnam's
communist government.
   Schroeder said officials in many Asian and Western Pacific
nations count on U.S. support but are not eager to have American
troops stationed on their soil.
   ``It's clear they want us in the region not so much because they
fear the Soviet presence but because they fear a power vacuum not
knowing who might move in,'' she said. ``They'd like us in the
region but not in their country.''
   Based on this reaction, Schroeder said she will introduce
legislation next week calling for ``dual basing'' in which most of
the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps units would be stationed in
the United States unless some operational requirement exists to
place them overseas.
   The units would be sent on short-term assignments ranging from a
week to six months for exercises and training.
   ``The passage and implementation of this legislation would
permit the closure of the vast majority of the 86 major and 37
minor overseas installations,'' said Schroeder, who heads the House
Armed Services subcommittee on military installations and
facilities.
   The congresswoman has been critical of Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's list of candidates for base closing, charging that the
list is partisan and fails to include enough overseas bases.

<HEAD>Government To Hold Hearing On Safety Defect In Mini-Motorhomes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 25,000 compact pickup trucks converted
into small motorhomes have a defect that could cause their rear
wheels to come off, according to federal highway safety officials
who plan a hearing on the problem.
   In the first such action in six years involving a vehicle on
U.S. roads, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
upgraded a 2-year-old defects investigation into ``an initial
determination that a safety defect exists.''
   The action taken earlier this week could lead to a recall, but
none has yet been ordered, said NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd on Friday.
Manufacturers usually issue recalls on their own before the
government forces the issue, but the motorhomes are built by 30
different companies, he said.
   The last step before a recall order will be a public meeting May
23 in Washington at which anyone may testify
   The agency determined that the motorhomes have overloaded rear
axles which can cause failure of wheel bearings or axle shafts and
result in the vehicle's wheels coming off.
   The vehicles have prompted 440 reports of problems, including 16
accidents with injuries and 63 instances in which wheels fell off
the axles, according to George Reagle, NHTSA associate
administrator for enforcement.
   The small motorhomes are nearly all modified versions of Toyota
mini-pickup trucks, with double wheels installed in the rear. About
25,000 were sold between 1977 and 1986, NHTSA said.
   Reagle warned owners of the homes to take precautions until the
issue is settled.
   He recommended that they avoid unbalanced loads, minimize weight
on the rear axle, keep water tanks nearly empty while traveling,
and avoid towing anything or using a roof rack.
   Tire pressure should be checked frequently, with inside tires at
a slightly higher pressure than those on the outside, he said, also
recommending that rear wheel bearings be inspected every 10,000
miles and that a competent mechanic be asked to inspect the whole
rear axle and rear suspension.
   The 30 manufacturers of the units identified by NHTSA are Blue
Marlin, Coachman, Damon, Esquire, EZ Rider, Four Seasons,
Gardner-Pacific, Granville, Huntsman, Keystone, Leisure Odyssey,
Odyssey, Mirage of Elkhart, Monterey Leisure, National RV (Dolphin
and Seabreeze,) New Horizon, New World, Perris Valley Campers,
Ranger, RBR, Rockwood, Saddleback, Sandtana, Shasta, Sun-Land
Express, Sunline, Sunrader, Travette, Voyager and Western RV.

<HEAD>School Bells Ring Again in Oklahoma After Reform and Funding Bill
Passes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma teachers expressed hope Friday
that the largest reform and funding bill in state history would end
the ``no more pencils, no more books'' crisis they said they had
faced for years.
   Most teachers and their students were back in classes Friday
after an unprecedented four-day walkout that brought thousands of
protesting teachers to the Capitol to push for passage of the
education bill.
   ``That's one of the things that got us this bill,'' Gerald
Hoeltzel, state school superintendent, said of the funding crisis.
``As the amount of money available for education dwindled over the
past few years, some school districts flatly told teachers there
was no money for instructional materials and others made just small
amounts available to the teachers.''
   As a result, Hoeltzel said, teachers had to dip into their own
pockets to buy construction paper and supplemental books.
   ``We ran a little survey last year and we found out that the
average Oklahoma teacher was spending $354 of his own money for
supplies for his students,'' Hoeltzel said.
   The National Education Association ranked Oklahoma 48th in
teacher salaries and 46th in total funding for public schools.
   The Oklahoma Education Association urged teachers to return to
classes Friday after passage of the education bill. Neither the
association nor Hoeltzel was able to say how many schools remained
closed. Those that did not reopen Friday were expected to resume
classes Monday.
   The $230 million bill passed by the Senate provides the largest
infusion of funds to public schools in state history. The bill
calls for spending $68.1 million to raise minimum teacher salaries
by $1,500 a year for four years. Additional money may be spent on
salaries at the discretion of the school districts.
   Oklahoma teacher salaries average $22,000 annually; the national
average is $29,648.
   ``It is not uncommon to find a single-income teacher whose
family can qualify for reduced-price lunches,'' Hoeltzel said.
   Thousands of teachers deserted the classrooms and walked the
picket line at the Capitol to pressure the Senate for final passage
of the bill as well as the emergency clause, which makes the bill
go into effect as soon as Gov. Henry Bellmon signs it, instead of
the usual 90-day wait.
   Bellmon, a Republican, called the special legislative session to
address school funding and said he would sign the bill. The signing
is expected next week.
   A two-month stalemate was broken late Thursday when five
Democratic senators switched and voted for the emergency clause.
The bill got only one Republican vote, a fact Bellmon said ``is
nothing to be proud of.''
   Although the bill will provide $230 million for education in its
first year, part of that will be siphoned off for a sales tax
rebate for poor people. That was the concession made to get the
necessary five votes for the emergency clause.
   The OEA represents 31,000 of the state's 35,000 school teachers.
An estimated 20,000 teachers took part in the walkout at various
times and education officials said about 60 percent, or 343,200 of
the state's 572,000 students, were affected by the walkout.

   The Army said Friday it grounded all 290 of
its CH-47D ``Chinook'' cargo helicopters after cracks were found in
barrel nuts in a chopper undergoing routine maintenance.
   None will fly again until each of its four barrel nuts is
inspected, the Army said.
   The Chinook is the Army's only medium-lift helicopter. It has
twin engines, tandem rotors and is designed to move ammunition,
repair parts, petroleum, troops, artillery and special weapons
about the battlefield.
   The chopper, built by Boeing Helicopter Co., was designed in the
1950s and fielded in 1962. A modernization program was begun in
1975 to upgrade the chopper's three models to the newest `D'
version. The modernization included such changes as adding new
fiberglass rotor blades, new transmission and drive systems and
modernized hydraulic and electrical systems.
   In a statement, the Army said the grounding was ordered because
``cracks have been found in the barrel nuts associated with the
aircraft's forward transmission.'' Four of the nuts are used to
secure the transmission to the airframe, the statement said.
   ``It is estimated that approximately 300 of the suspect barrel
nuts are currently in the Army's inventory,'' the statement said.
   Last August and again in October, the Army grounded most of its
Chinook fleet after problems were found in the helicopter's
transmission oil cooling fan.

<HEAD>Democrats Make Gesture to Republicans on Campaign Finance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats, offering an ``olive branch''
to spur serious negotiations with Republicans on campaign finance
reform, retreated Friday on their demand for fixed ceilings on how
much candidates can spend.
   Caucusing behind closed doors for nearly two hours, Democratic
senators also agreed to embrace proposals by Republican Sen. John
Danforth of Missouri for reducing the cost of TV advertising and
discouraging negative campaign tactics.
   ``We're trying to send a signal to Republicans. I hope they'll
look upon it as a signal,'' said Oklahoma Sen. David Boren, the
author of a Democratic campaign reform bill that the party's
leaders want to bring to the Senate floor late next week.
   The Democratic meeting followed a similar GOP meeting Thursday
among more than half of the Senate's 45 Republicans on campaign
reform. Senators planned to huddle again in party caucuses next
Tuesday.
   Boren and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, a GOP point man on the
issue, both plan to have revised porposals on behalf of their
parties prepared by early next week.
   ``Before you can have real negotiations, you have to have each
side say, `here is our starting point,''' Boren said. ``We know
we're not going to enact a law by picking off people on the other
side. Fundamentally, it is going to have to be a bill that is not
passed on party lines.''
   However, one new obstacle to a possible consensus emerged Friday
among the 20 Democratic senators up for re-election in 1992.
Several among them, including some of the nine who swept seats
formerly held by Republicans in 1986 to return the Senate to
Democratic control, objected to any new restrictions until after
the '92 election.
   ``Everybody's for it in the abstract _ and wants it to take
effect next time,'' quipped Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Democrats would
exchange ideas over the weekend on how to ``grandfather''
exemptions for candidates ``who have already raised and spent'' so
much they face exceeding the limits well before the 1992 election.
   While Boren said such exemptions would obviously apply to
challengers as well, minority Republicans can be expected to raise
vigorous objections because incumbents easily amass large campaign
chests early in the six-year Senate election cycle.
   The development could throw the 1986 class of freshman Democrats
in the Senate into an unusual alliance with House Republican
campaign officials, who already are building a warchest for the
1992 election.
   Because 1992 is the first election after congressional districts
are reapportioned based on this year's census, Republicans look
upon it as a better opportunity than 1990 to cut significantly into
the 258-176 majority that Democrats now enjoy in the House.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., according to sources,
has even suggested to his GOP counterpart, Rep. Bob Michel of
Illinois, that Democrats might consider delaying implementation of
any new campaign spendig law until after 1992 as a concession to
Republicans.
   Mitchell said Friday there has been no such talk among Senate
Democrats.
   Boren said the revised Democratic package will include
``flexible'' ceilings that would restrict how much candidates can
raise from out-of-state donors but impose no limits on small
contributions from in-state residents.

<TEXT>
   The cease-fire in Nicaragua's
9-year-old civil war and an agreement to dismantle the rebel army
have bought time for the incoming U.S.-backed government to show it
can solve the country's problems.
   A pacified Nicaragua is essential to President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, whose inauguration Wednesday will end a decade
of leftist Sandinista rule. Mrs. Chamorro's promises of reviving
the moribund economy were a key reason for her electoral rout Feb.
25 of President Daniel Ortega's Sandinistas.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Mrs. Chamorro said after the agreements were
signed Thursday, ``because we don't want war anymore, we want peace
and reconciliation.''
   The history of peace and cease-fire pacts in Central America is
not encouraging, but the agreements appear to have a better chance
than most of succeeding.
   For one thing, the negotiations involved one of the Contra's
senior field leaders, Oscar Sovalbarro. Most previous agreements
have been about the Contras without actually involving them, giving
them no stake in compliance.
   The Sandinistas appear to have decided to play the part of a
democratic opposition after their electoral defeat; they are moving
to change from a narrowly defined revolutionary party to a broader
political movement.
   In the two days of talks, there was little of the posturing that
suggests the parties are playing for publicity. Only one
photographer was allowed into the signing ceremony, unlike past
scenes of wall-to-wall photographers.
   ``Let it be clear that what has been signed here is something
serious, something formal, and I think that we all have the good
will to fulfill this signed document,'' Sovalbarro said.
   Sandinista army Gen. Humberto Ortega, defense minister and
brother of the president, said he was satisfied with what he called
an agreement reached ``in a profound, serious way, with a great
spirit of responsibility.''
   But nine years of civil war and 30,000 deaths in a country of 3
million have left a legacy of suspicion. Guns have always meant
power in Central America, where democracy has no tradition, and
neither side wants to be the first to put down its weapons.
   On Thursday, President Ortega said the agreements brought the
nation ``much closer to peace'' but the pacts still had to be
carried out.
   ``The war will have disappeared on the moment that all the
Contras have disarmed,'' he said.
   For its part, the Sandinista Party controls not just the army
but also cooperative farms, unions and other peasant and worker
organizations that have weapons. Cadres at neighborhood party
headquarters are also armed.
   The Sandinistas fear the Contras would become a right-wing
military force and help overturn reforms in health, education and
land distribution; the Contras fear continued Sandinista control of
the army would lead to an overthrow of Mrs. Chamorro.
   Both sides fear a wave of vendettas if families seek the return
of seized farms or revenge for those slain in the fighting.
   The bitterness was visible only hours after the accords were
signed, when a senior U.S. State Department envoy was surrounded by
a mob pounding on his car's windows, demanding the Contras be
demobilized at once.
   Washington backed the Contras in their war. It then supported
Mrs. Chamorro in the election and backed her call for the Contras'
dissolution.
   An additional problem is finding jobs for demobilized fighters:
the Contras number about 9,000 and the Sandinista army is much
larger, although it has suffered from desertion.
   Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition alliance is pressing
the United States for $300 million in aid, with a good chunk to be
devoted to disbanding the Contras. But even if the aid arrives
quickly, the government won't be able to ease the chronic economic
problems, including unemployment.
   The cease-fire took effect Thursday and the Contras agreed to
dismantle by June 10, 6{ weeks after Mrs. Chamorro takes office
Wednesday. That represented a concession by the Contras, who had
refused to even consider talking about disarming until Mrs.
Chamorro took power.
   The Sandinistas had been demanding the Contras disband by
inauguration day, but Gen. Ortega said June 10 was soon enough. The
lag will also allow each to assess the other's sincerity.
   Mrs. Chamorro's alliance and the Sandinistas signed an agreement
March 27 that called for shrinking and de-politicizing the army in
exchange for government recognition of the army's
``professionalism.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's coalition views the Contras as both allies and
problems, and some Contras suspect the new government would like
nothing more than for the Contras to go away now that electoral
victory has been achieved.
   The coalition gained the most from Thursday's agreement, even if
it only postpones the issues of disarming and demobilizing.
   The agreements give the new government some _ not much, but some
_ political breathing space. If it can show that it is in control,
those who are dissatisfied may find themselves isolated and the
disarmament agreements will have a better chance of sticking and
bringing peace, at last, to Nicaragua.

   The calliope blared, Pete Fountain and his
Half-Fast Walking Club strutted and actress Helen Hayes had a few
nice things to say as Delta Queen Steamboat Co. celebrated its
100th year on the Mississippi River.
   ``My favorite form of recreation is riding the river. I've just
completed my 12th journey on the Mississippi River,'' Miss Hayes
told about 150 guests and a few hundred people attracted by the
hour of Dixieland music that preceded the ceremonies.
   ``I've seen them all, all the rivers. But this is the greatest _
the Mississippi,'' she said.
   The four-deck Delta Queen, white with green decks and gleaming
wood doors, window frames and railing, was the backdrop for the
platform where Miss Hayes spoke. The steamboat was designated a
national landmark in 1989.
   Docked next to the Delta Queen, was the seven-deck Mississippi
Queen, which carried Miss Hayes from New Orleans to Vicksburg and
back.
   Flags of the 14 states that line the Mississippi River system
and a United States flag fluttered behind the platform, which also
bore a 5-foot-high cake decorated like the ``floating wedding
cake'' _ the steamboat _ behind it.
   Grammy-award winner Aaron Neville sang ``Happy Birthday'' and
Miss Hayes, grasping a long cake knife, posed with U.S. Rep. Lindy
Boggs, D-La., company president Patrick Fahey and Gordon C. Greene
III, grandson of the company's founder.
   Earlier, the crowd heard from President Bush, whose letter was
read by U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., and from Gov. Buddy
Roemer, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and Roger Durrett, who rides the
riverboats and emceed the ceremonies in the character of Mark Twain.
   Twain piloted paddlewheelers when they were still the fastest
and most reliable way for goods and passengers to move along the
Mississippi River.
   By the time Greene's grandfather founded the Greene Steamboat
Company in 1890, they were giving way to railways, which ran
regardless of snags or water levels.
   Despite that, the first Gordon Greene made an excellent business
of steamboats. He, his wife, Mary _ who stood watches with her
husband during their honeymoon and later became a pilot and captain
_ and their sons eventually owned a fleet of 28 boats.
   In 1946 their son Tom bought the Delta Queen at an auction from
the U.S. Maritime Commission. The 285-foot-long boat had been built
for $875,000 in 1926 as a Sacramento River luxury shuttle, but was
taken over by the Navy in 1940, painted gray and renamed Yard Ferry
Boat 56.
   Tom Greene bought the boat for $46,250, but had to pay another
$750,000 to scrape off the Navy paint and restore the Delta Queen.
The company was renamed the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. in 1973.
   The flagship's captain for the past 14 years has been Gabriel
``Gabe'' Chengery, 42.
   ``I've been in love with these paddlewheelers since I was 7
years old,'' he said while Fountain led his jazz band and ``walking
club,'' a group of Mardi Gras revelers who were dressed in purple
and pink pirate costumes.
   ``Are you the captain of the Delta Queen?'' a tourist mistakenly
asked Rear Adm. Maurice ``Moss'' Bresnahan, whose rows of medals
were bright against his Navy whites.
   ``No, but I'm flattered,'' the commander of the U.S. Navy
Reserve Surface Fleet answered with a smile.

   President Bush's 1991 defense budget could be
cut nearly $6 billion through reductions including Star Wars
spending and delaying a plan to put MX nuclear missiles on rail
cars, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
Friday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., called for a military budget of $297
billion to $298 billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Bush wants a $303 billion budget, including an additional $1
billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as
Star Wars.
   ``Assuming SDI is redirected into a coherent and rational
research program, I believe it should be funded at roughly the
current appropriated level,'' Nunn said in a speech on the Senate
floor.
   Congress approved about $3.8 billion for the anti-missile shield
in 1990's $296 billion defense budget. The SDI total marked the
first reduction in the program in six years.
   Nunn's overall budget proposal is about $1.5 billion more than
the cut adopted Thursday by the House Budget Committee and some $6
billion higher than the figure suggested by Senate Budget Committee
chairman Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   ``I think the fight will be to try to keep defense even at the
levels I'm talking about,'' Nunn said.
   He projected defense savings of about $3 billion to $3.5 billion
this year from the changes in the strategic programs and between
$20 billion and $30 billion over the next five years.
   Nunn's comments on the budget were the first by the powerful
chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He is the leading defense
expert among conservative Democrats.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, White House budget director Richard
Darman dismissed all Democratic defense proposals and argued that
lawmakers' affection for pet defense project in their districts
will prevail over the cuts.
   ``As it gets much more clear what it means for particular
congressmen's districts, you'll see the political system,
independent of defense strategy, start to put a bottom on that
defense cut,'' Darman said.
   Nunn called his budget range a ``realistic and responsible
target.''
   He said there should be a delay in placing multiple-warhead MX
missiles on railroad cars and criticized the purchase of trains
while the Pentagan is still conducting tests.
   The Bush budget calls for $2.2 billion to put 50 MX missiles on
rail cars.
   Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and James Jeffords, R-Vt., introduced
legislation Friday that would cut $1.6 billion of the
administration proposal for the MX. That total represents all the
procurement and military construction funds in Bush's budget for MX.
   ``The MX rail-garrison funding plan is a classic example of the
flawed `buy before you fly' policy that has cost the country so
much money in recent years,'' Levin said in a speech on the Senate
floor.
   Nunn reiterated his support for the single-warhead Midgetman
missile, but suggested deployment in existing silos with mobile
launchers a later option.
   He repeated his opposition to development of a new short-range
nuclear missile in Europe and questioned buying a new Trident
submarine each year and Trident D-5 missiles with nuclear warheads
in short supply.
   Nunn reserved comment on the B-2 stealth bomber until after
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney briefs members of Congress on the
Pentagon's review of major aircraft programs. However, Nunn said
the B-2 program of 132 planes at a cost of $72 billion ``must be
made more affordable.''
   Nunn called for slashing Bush's defense budget authority to $289
billion to $291 billion, about $18 billion less than the president
has proposed for fiscal 1991.
   Because budget authority represents the amount that can be spent
over several years _ such as in a long-term contract to purchase
warships _ the cut would force reductions in future Pentagon
spending plans.

   A poll released Friday puts former Sen.
Lawton Chiles 34 points ahead of U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson in the race
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
   The poll was released two days after the third candidate dropped
out.
   Chiles also has a 6-point edge over Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, according to Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, which
interviewed 618 registered voters. The poll's margin of error was 4
percentage points.
   State Sen. George Stuart dropped out of the Democratic race on
Wednesday, eliminating the need for a runoff, and threw his support
behind Chiles the next day.
   The poll was conducted between Monday and Wednesday, but
surveyed people's preferences between two candidates.
   Chiles last week said he was inspired to end his self-imposed
retirement by Vaclav Havel, the formerly dissident playwright who
is now president of Czechoslovakia.
   The Mason-Dixon poll also found that voters generally weren't
concerned about Chiles' admission that he is taking the commonly
prescribed anti-depressant drug Prozac.
   The 60-year-old former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
underwent open-heart surgery in 1985 and has been treated for
depression since late last year. Chiles said last week that he
first noticed the condition sometime before retiring from the U.S.
Senate in 1988.
   Stuart launched his run for governor in early 1988, but trailed
Nelson in polls and campaign contributions. He endorsed Chiles
after announcing that he would instead run for state treasurer and
insurance commissioner.
   Martinez, Florida's second Republican governor since
Reconstruction, is seeking a second four-year term.

<HEAD>Activists Rally for Oil Drilling Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KEY LARGO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's silence on environmental
policies affecting Florida's Keys during his visit has not been
matched by activists. They're using his vacation as a forum to call
for an offshore oil drilling ban.
   Several organizations have announced plans for demonstrations
this weekend in Islamorada, where Bush has scheduled a fishing
excursion and a ceremony honoring a coral reef preservation group
on Sunday. One group has promised daiquiris mixed in solar-powered
blenders.
   Also, some officials have criticized the administration's
inaction on the oil drilling issue and Sunday's upcoming Earth Day
celebrations to assail Bush, who proclaimed himself the
``environmental president'' while campaigning.
   ``For Bush to remain silent when all of the Florida Keys is
opposed to offshore oil drilling is appalling,'' said Ann
Whitfield, executive director of the Florida Public Interest
Research Group. ``This would have been the time to act, but he
missed an opportunity to show he has a real interest in the
environment.''
   Bush has said he is willing to ban drilling in some
environmentally sensitive areas, but stopped short of guaranteeing
protection of the Florida Keys.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., urged Bush to ban oil drilling and
support a Coast Guard plan to move shipping lanes farther from
fragile reefs off the Keys, where three freighters ran aground last
year.
   ``You know all the arguments and I look forward to the day when
we will spend our time telling fish stories instead of debating the
issues,'' Fascell said in a letter to Bush issued Thursday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that Bush
will not make a policy announcement on the oil drilling issue this
weekend. Fitzwater said a task-force report on oil drilling off
Florida and California needs more study.
   The special presidential task force issued its report in
January, but the findings have not been disclosed. A temporary
moratorium on oil exploration on key tracts off the California and
Florida expires Oct. 1.
   There are 73 leases issued to oil companies off Florida's
southwest coast affected by the present moratorium. In California,
oil companies have proposed developing millions of acres off the
state's central and northern coasts.
   On Saturday, Greenpeace and several others groups will hold a
mock ``before and after'' protest to illustrate the damage an oil
spill would have on the Keys' sensitive coral reefs and mangrove
coastline.
   The following day at the lodge where Bush is staying, members of
Environmental Solutions Inc. have scheduled an exhibit to show
energy alternatives to oil. An invitation to the event promises
daiquiris mixed in solar-powered blenders.
   Among the proposals endorsed by environmental groups is revoking
the 73 oil leases and permanently banning off-shore drilling south
of 26 degrees north latitude, a bill co-sponsored by Florida's two
U.S. senators. That latitude runs across Florida roughly from
Naples to Fort Lauderdale.
   A ban on oil drilling in the Everglades is scheduled to be
considered next month by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``We have a unique opportunity here as environmentalists _ to
solve a problem before it becomes a problem,'' said Ms. Whitfield.
   On Key Largo, the threat of an oil spill from a tanker or
off-shore rig is particularly worrisome to those who make their
livings off the reef and the clear waters.
   ``One oil spill _ one mistake _ and the Keys as we know them are
gone,'' said Anthony Greene, who operates snorkling tours. ``It's
goodbye Keys, hello New Jersey.''
   Studies of a 1986 oil spill off Panama show severe damage to
coral reefs and oil seeping deep into the sediment in the mangrove
areas, said Lisa Speer, senior scientists at the New York-based
Natural Resources Defense Council.
   ``A spill in the Keys would be quite different than the Valdez
spill in Alaska,'' said Ms. Speer. ``Without the pounding wave
action, the oil filters down and remains there. It would be a huge
tragedy.''

<TEXT>
   Air and land rescue teams searched
dense, mountainous jungle in southern Costa Rica Friday for a light
plane carrying two Danish journalists who were making a film about
the country's national parks.
   The single-engine Cessna disappeared Monday after leaving San
Jose for Corcovado National Park, according to Civil Aviation
operations chief Jose Trejos. He said the search began about three
hours after the plane disappeared.
   Park director Eliecer Arce identified the journalists as Johnny
Kosten, 45, and Bo Kristian Pedersen, 38. He said they had been
filming in the area for Danish TV for three weeks. Their Costa
Rican pilot was Miguel Cespedes, 35.
   Meanwhile in Panama, divers on Friday brought up the last of 20
victims of a plane crash in the Pacific, civil aviation authorities
there said.
   The victims included four Americans.
   A 14-year-old French boy and a Swiss woman were the only
survivors of the Wednesday crash of the Aeroperlas Twin Otter
aircraft.
   The wreckage lay 90 feet down a mile north of Contadora Island.
The plane crashed after taking off from the tourist island for
Panama City.
   A U.S. Embassy official identified the Americans as Panama Canal
pilot Karl Heck and his wife, Anita, both of Panama City; Lisa
Langlow, 34, whose family lives in Fox Island, Wash.; and Richard
Dobson Poux, also of Washington state. No other ages or hometowns
were available, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Three Doctors Overprescribed Drugs to Elizabeth Taylor, DA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three physicians who treated Elizabeth Taylor
overprescribed narcotics for their ``demanding, famous client'' but
will not be criminally prosecuted, the district attorney's office
said Friday.
   ``It is clear that the prescribing practices of these physicians
fell below the accepted standard of medical practice,'' Deputy
District Attorney Daniel Feldstern wrote in a report.
   ``However, it is equally clear that these physicians, in trying
to resolve the patient's medical condition, were also attempting to
deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and
treatment, and that their conduct was lacking in the requisite
criminal intent,'' it said.
   Miss Taylor was battling pneumonia at St. John's Hospital and
Health Center in nearby Santa Monica. She remained in stable
condition Friday, her spokeswoman, Lisa Del Favaro, said from New
York.
   The illness is not believed to be linked to the prescriptions.
   The 58-year-old actress was expected to remain hospitalized
through the weekend, said Ms. Del Favaro. She said Miss Taylor was
in good spirits, receiving a stream of cards and letters from
well-wishers.
   Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner declined to
prosecute Drs. William Skinner, Michael Gottlieb and Michael Roth,
but will refer the case to the state medical board for possible
disciplinary action, the report said.
   Messages left with the doctors' exchanges Friday were not
immediately returned.
   In 1983, Miss Taylor acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems. She
was treated at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage for alcohol
and drug abuse that year.
   From mid-1987 to October 1988, Skinner, Gottlieb and Roth were
treating Miss Taylor for a painful, chronic back condition and
cumulative effects of addictive medication, the report stated.
   Skinner is medical director of the chemical dependency center at
St. John's. Gottlieb is the immunologist who reported the first
AIDS cases in the United States, and Roth was once Gottlieb's
partner.
   Skinner, who was instrumental in having Miss Taylor admitted to
the Ford clinic, wrote hundreds of the prescriptions investigated,
Gottlieb wrote dozens and Roth wrote prescriptions infrequently,
the report said.
   Among drugs Skinner prescribed were Demerol, Percodan, Valium,
Ativan, Xanax, Preludin and Dilaudin. Demerol is the brand name for
meperidine, a strong narcotic analgesic similar to morphine.
   The evidence concerning Miss Taylor's treatment was reviewed for
Reiner's office by Dr. David Smith, referred to in the report as an
authority in addiction medicine.
   Smith found that ``over-prescribing was clearly documented,''
the report stated, but it pointed out that the doctors also tried
to ``detoxify the patient'' and to convince her to re-enter the
Ford Center in November 1988.
   ``I recommend that some appropriate administrative action be
taken so that the physicians in question, no matter how well
intended, learn that following appropriate prescribing guidelines
coupled with established principles of chemical dependency apply
even to a demanding, famous client,'' Smith wrote.
   Dave Thornton, a senior investigator with the Board of Medical
Quality Assurance in Sacramento, said discipline could range from a
reprimand to license suspension.
   Miss Taylor was hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. She was transferred to St. John's
on Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
   The actress had a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the year
she won an Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.''

<HEAD>Panel: New Gov't Enjoys Support, But Rights Violations Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The new civilian government has
considerable popular backing in its push to end a history of human
rights abuses and to hold elections, the head of an international
rights panel said Friday.
   But rights violations persist following the ouster of a military
government in March, and panel members would not say whether
conditions were conducive to holding the first free and fair
balloting since Haiti gained independence 186 years ago.
   ``Any country which is going toward elections is a country which
is moving away from violations of human rights,'' said Oliver
Jackman, chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
of the Organization of American States.
   Jackman said the new government ``enjoys a considerable measure
of popular support and has the specific mandate to create the
conditions for elections,'' which are expected this year.
   However, another member of Jackman's delegation, Patrick
Robinson, said: ``In some respects, the situation has not improved
(since the last visit by the commission in August 1988).''
   In March, 83 Haitians were killed and more than 120 injured in
rights abuses, the Haitian Center for the Defense of Rights and
Liberties said in a report this month.
   The nine-member OAS commission, in Haiti since Monday,
interviewed Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the former Supreme Court
justice who took over when Prosper Avril quit and fled the country
last month following a weeklong popular uprising.
   The commission also talked with her chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Herard Abraham, and other government officials, political and
rights activists, members of the press, and other civic and
religious leaders.
   It said it was told of the necessity to disarm paramilitary
thugs, break up the repressive country sheriff system and separate
the police force from the army, as provided for in the 1987
constitution.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, an attempt at free elections was canceled
after at least 34 voters were shot or hacked to death at the polls
by thugs in collusion with the army. In September 1988, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, considered responsible for the attack on the voters,
was ousted in a palace coup.
   Avril, Namphy's successor, had promised reforms but jailed
opponents and encountered severe criticism over rights policies.
   Under the civilian caretaker government that replaced Avril,
Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot governs with a 19-member Council of State.
   Elections are expected before the end of this year, and will be
organized and controlled by a nine-member independent electoral
council and probably supervised by U.N. and OAS election monitors.

   President Bush designated five
environmentally troubled waterways Friday for intense review and
development of cleanup plans, including the bay that leads into
Boston's polluted harbor.
   The president said the waterways in Maine, Massachusetts,
Louisiana and Florida would become part of the National Estuary
Program and be eligible for some of the $16 million in federal
funds under the program.
   Congress established the National Estuary Program in 1987 to
help protect and improve the environmental quality of significant
estuaries. Twelve estuaries already are in the conservation program.
   Under the program, federal and state money is used for a
five-year study and planning effort aimed at identifying key
environmental problems and ways to resolve them. States must
provide some matching funds.
   The five waterways singled out by Bush are Tampa Bay and the
Indian River Complex, both in Florida; the Barataria-Terrebonne
Estuarine Complex in Louisiana; Casco Bay in Maine, and
Massachusetts Bay in Massachusetts.
   Massachusetts Bay leads into Boston Harbor, which became a
subject of debate in the 1988 presidential campaign after Bush
criticized Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for not cleaning up
the harbor.
   Since then, some environmentalists have criticized the Bush
administration for not providing federal money for further harbor
cleanup in Boston.
   Bush, speaking at a fund-raising dinner for Florida's Republican
Party in Orlando, said he was pleased to make the announcement on
expanding the estuary program ``as we head into the Earth Day.''
   ``It's a good first step,'' Rudy Rosen, an expert waterway
conservation problems for the National Wildlife Federation, of the
president's action.
   But Rosen added that the designation would mean little if not
followed by further action. ``Designation is great, but it's got to
be backed with regulatory enforcement, both state and federal, and
the money to do the job,'' he said in an interview.
   Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and Conservation
Association, called the announcement ``a good step'' but said on
many environmental areas the president has ``backtracked badly''
from campaign promises.
   Bush also came under attack Friday from congressional Democrats
who accused the president of not following his rhetoric with action
on environmental issues.
   A group of Democratic senators, including Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, criticized Bush for not moving more aggressively
to deal with global warming, opting instead to call for additional
research.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., said Bush failed to ``provide the
leadership'' earlier in the week at an international White House
conference on global warming. European delegates have sought
commitments on specific reductions in carbon dioxide emissions,
while the White House has said more research is needed for such
pollution controls should be sought.
   ``President Bush refused to call the nation to action on the
serious problem of global warming, rather he used (the conference)
to call attention to all of the obstacles,'' said Mitchell at a
news conference to discuss Earth Day.
   In the House, Democrats called on Bush to celebrate Earth Day by
declaring his support for legislation that would force federal
agencies to comply with the same environmental laws the government
imposes on industry.
   ``The federal government has operated under a ``do as I say, not
as I do'' rule,'' more than 80 House Democrats said in a letter to
Bush.
   Although Bush promised during his campaign to bring the
government agencies into compliance with federal environmental
laws, the White House has opposed efforts in Congress to mandate
such compliance as part of a bill elevating the Environmental
Protection Agency to cabinet level.

<TEXT>
   Marla Maples, who declared her love for married
billionaire Donald Trump on ABC News' ``PrimeTime Live,'' proved a
ratings bonanza for the show, preliminary Nielsen audience
estimates showed Friday.
   Not only did the show win its time period for the first time
since it made its debut in August, the ratings were the show's
highest since its October special on the San Francisco earthquake,
which killed 67 people.
   Thursday's ``PrimeTime Live'' with the Maples interview averaged
a 14.2 rating, compared with a 12.6 rating for the show's
earthquake broadcast. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Network programs competing with the ABC News exclusive _ NBC's
rerun of an ``L.A. Law'' episode and a CBS special, ``Learned Pigs
and Fireproof Women'' _ averaged a 13.0 and an 8.7 in the ratings,
respectively.
   Diane Sawyer, who co-anchors ABC's show with Sam Donaldson,
conducted the interview with Maples. Maples is said to be the
``other woman'' in Trump's life. The developer is estranged from
his wife, Ivana.
   Maples declined in the interview to characterize her

   The Canadian utility representative spoke of
kilowatts, reservoirs and big savings to taxpayers, but the grand
chief of the Cree Indian tribe saw a giant hydroelectric project in
a different light.
   ``It will be a cultural genocide for us,'' said Cree Grand Chief
Matthew Coon-Come. ``Our main diet is fish. They tell us we cannot
eat the fish.''
   ``America, you are the builder. Wall Street is financing. It's
time the little guy starts speaking up,'' Coon-Come said Thursday
after he and other Indians paddled up in a canoe and climbed onto a
lower Manhattan dock in the shadow of skyscrapers.
   It was the last stop on a 1,300-mile trip from their Quebec
homes.
   Coon-Come and Robert Brunette, a vice president of the
government-owned Hydro-Quebec, differ about how much land the
project would affect. Estimates range as high as several hundred
thousand square miles.
   Most of the power generated would benefit Canada. But up to 10
percent would be exported to various of the United States.
   The project requires reversing the course of three rivers.
   And it means building six more dams along five rivers that flow
into James Bay in northern Quebec.
   The contracts to finance the project and sell the power have
been signed. The only remaining obstacles are approval from
Canada's National Energy Board and an avalanche of bad publicity
brought on by the 10,000 Cree and Inuit Indians who live along the
James Bay.
   Brunette conceded that some species of fish would be made
inedible by mercury contamination.
   ``There is jubilation in my heart and also I cry,'' said
Coon-Come, relieved at completing his journey but predicting
doomsday for his home environment.
   ``Some people call us primitive,'' Coon-Come said. ``We still
hunt and fish as a way of life. We have protected that land.''
   He drew sympathy from Dennis DeLeon, New York City's Human
Rights commissioner, and from city Councilwoman Miriam Friedlander,
who said people ``continue without thinking to destroy fragile
parts of the earth.''
   The New York Power Authority says that buying hydroelectric
power from Quebec since 1978 has saved more than $600 million and
eliminated the need for nearly 6 billion gallons of oil.
   The state would be able to start drawing power from the new
project in 1995, saving about $3 billion over 20 years, said Power
Authority Chairman Richard Flynn.
   He said the project would cause significantly less environmental
damage than the coal-burning plants that would have to be built
otherwise.
   As for the Indians, Flynn said, ``We really think it's an
internal affair for the Canadians.''

<HEAD>NRC: Arson Fire at Inspector's House Worst Violence Against Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A fire that gutted the home of a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector is the most serious case of
violence in the agency's history, an NRC official said Friday.
   ``I'm not aware of anything of this magnitude in the past,''
said Ken Clark, an NRC spokesman in Atlanta who has been with the
agency since its inception in 1975.
   The fire Thursday destroyed the home of Ken Jenison, the NRC's
chief resident inspector at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, hours after he
received threatening telephone calls. Specifics of the calls
weren't released.
   The fire was ruled an arson Friday, said Hamilton County arson
investigator Jimmy Swafford. A basement window was found broken and
it appeared fires were started in the basement and on the second
floor.
   Nobody was injured, but officials estimated damage at $150,000.
Jenison was scheduled to be transferred later this month and the
house was listed for sale at $110,000.
   Jenison, who was at work when he heard of the fire, tried to
leave the plant, but discovered that the lugs on his car wheels had
been loosened.
   The FBI, Hamilton County arson investigators and the Tennessee
Valley Authority, the federal utility that operates Sequoyah, are
all investigating the fire.
   ``Every agent in the southern part of the state is working on
this,'' said William Baugh, special agent in charge of the FBI's
Knoxville office.
   The blaze occurred less than a week after the NRC fined the TVA
$240,000 for harassing whistleblowers at its Watts Bar Nuclear
Plant and recommended a $75,000 penalty for failing to correct a
safety problem at Sequoyah.
   ``It is always a possibility that someone will take offense at
something that happens as a result of some action an NRC inspector
takes,'' Clark said.
   Jenison had received harassing but unintelligible phone calls at
his home Wednesday night, and someone called him at his office
twice on Thursday, Clark said.
   ``It was something to the effect that they were going to burn
his house and it had to do with his being an NRC inspector,'' Clark
said. ``But I don't know the specifics.''
   Jenison was not in his office Friday and could not be reached
for comment.
   Clark said it was not uncommon for NRC officials to receive
harassing phone calls, but he said he could not recall any other
serious acts of violence.
   Jenison had not received any other harassing calls before
Wednesday _ although his house was burglarized in January _ and
there have not been any threats against the NRC's two other
inspectors at Sequoyah, officials said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say Barry Put Crack in Pocket Before Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Friday that Mayor Marion
Barry put crack cocaine in his jacket pocket and spoke of previous
cocaine use with ex-model Rasheeda Moore the night he was arrested
by the FBI.
   In court papers, the U.S. attorney's office said the Washington,
D.C., mayor and Moore ``talked of their previous times together,
including their past cocaine experiences,'' when they met in a
hotel room Jan. 18.
   The government filed the papers in opposition to Barry's motion
for dismissal of the charges against him. Barry argues that his
Fifth Amendment right to due process was violated because the
government ``manufactured the crime'' against him.
   Barry's lawyers said in an earlier filing that ``the facts ...
depict a conspiracy to distribute cocaine'' by the government, with
Barry's due process rights being violated by ``the lawless conduct
of ... police.''
   The prosecutors said Barry's ``conversation confirms that he had
drugs on his mind as soon as he arrived'' in the room at the Vista
Hotel, where the mayor was the target of an undercover sting
operation.
   ``Once he was alone in the room with Ms. Moore, he asked her in
their coded vocabulary if she was still using drugs,'' said the
23-page court filing.
   Once crack cocaine was obtained from an undercover agent posing
as a friend of Moore's, Barry ``took a portion of the crack and
placed it inside his jacket pocket which was hanging on a door knob
nearby,'' said the papers.
   ``After taking two hits from the pipe, he put on his jacket and
called his security officer by walkie-talkie as though he was ready
to leave,'' they added.
   Barry ``asked for the crack; he eagerly accepted it; and he
appeared to be quite adept at smoking it,'' said the prosecutors.
   Law enforcement officers then entered from an adjoining room and
arrested the mayor.
   The prosecutors also said that at the start of their
conversation, Barry ``indicated'' to Moore that ``he wanted cocaine
powder, not crack.'' But when the undercover agent left the room to
get powder, Barry told Moore to get the crack instead, said the
court filing. Moore called the undercover agent back in the room;
Barry gave money to Moore, and Moore bought a bag of crack.
   Barry faces trial June 4 on five counts of cocaine possession
and three counts of allegedly lying to a federal grand jury by
denying he had been involved in drugs with Charles Lewis, a former
city employee. Lewis is now the government's chief witness against
Barry.
   The prosecutors also asserted that Barry showed very little
liquor in his blood, making it difficult for him to argue that
``the government plied him with liquor in an effort to overcome his
resistance.''
   ``Actually, during the 45 minutes that he was in the hotel room,
cognac was poured sparingly from a bottle three times and only in
small amounts,'' said the prosecutors. ``He nursed his drink during
the duration of the visit.''
   His blood alcohol content was .005 after his arrest and ``would
have had to have been 20 times higher to reach even the threshold
legal limit for driving under the influence,'' said the government.

<HEAD>Mary Alice Williams Named Co-Anchor of NBC's ``Sunday Today''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Alice Williams was named Friday as the
permanent co-anchor of NBC's ``Sunday Today'' show, succeeding
Maria Shriver, who left the show two weeks ago to spend more time
with her family in Los Angeles.
   NBC's announcement had been expected. But negotiations continued
with NBC News for Williams also to be named anchor on the network's
Sunday night newscast, said NBC source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The news division's president, Michael G. Gartner, was not
available for comment. His office said he had left to spend the
weekend at his Iowa home.
   ``I'm thrilled she's been given `Sunday Today' and some other
assignments,'' said Williams' agent, Richard Liebner.
   Liebner, who also represents Shriver, referred to occasional
substitute anchoring that Williams also will do on the weeknight
``NBC Nightly News'' when the regular anchorman, Tom Brokaw, is
away.
   She is scheduled to anchor that newscast next Thursday and
Friday, as well as next weekend's editions of the newscast, NBC
said.
   Liebner declined to comment about whether he was still
negotiating with Gartner to make Williams the permanent anchor of
the Sunday newscast.
   NBC's annouuncement said that in addition to ``Sunday Today,''
Williams also will serve a substitute anchor on other NBC News
programs and do special assignments.
   One of CNN's original anchor staff, Williams joined NBC News in
March a year ago. Married to CNN correspondent Mark Hafeli, she
gave birth to a daughter, their first child, in January.
   Williams co-anchored ``Sunday Today'' with Garrick Utley last
week. She returned to work in March after a three-month maternity
leave.
   Shriver, who had co-anchored the show since it began in 1987,
also is a new mother. Married to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, with
whom she lives in Los Angeles, she gave birth to their first child,
also a daughter, in December.
   After a maternity leave of nearly four months, she returned to
``Sunday Today'' two weeks ago only to say that she was leaving it,
but would continue working at NBC News.
   She cited as reasons for her move a desire to spend more time
with her family and the strain of her weekly commute East to do the
show and anchor Saturday's ``NBC Nightly News.''
   In a statement, Gartner said Williams ``has done a terrific job
for NBC News over the past year. These (new) assignments will
enable us to better utilize her talents and expand her already
hefty contributions to NBC News.''

<HEAD>Former Ambassador Criticizes Bush China Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ambassador Winston Lord says President
Bush's China policy is wrong and marked by ``tawdry symbolism.''
   He said Bush should not have sent Brent Scowcroft, his national
security adviser, to Beijing after the suppression of pro-democracy
forces in Tiananmen Square last June. Lord also said the president
should not have relaxed sanctions against China.
   Lord, who was U.S. ambassador to China from 1985 until just
before troops attacked protesting students, said Bush is
disappointed his overtures to Beijing were not reciprocated.
   ``I don't think anyone would claim that they've achieved
anything,'' Lord said.
   The long-time China scholar made his remarks in an interview on
the PBS-TV program ``American Interests.'' It will be aired in
Washington on Saturday.
   ``First of all, I think we should keep contact,'' Lord said.
``But I think it should be a working-like relationship as long as
they are crushing the Chinese people.''
   He said it ``shouldn't include high-level emissaries going to
Beijing.''
   Lord's stand puts him at odds not only with Bush but with former
President Richard M. Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger, both of whom support strong U.S. ties to China despite
the Beijing government's actions.
   Nixon has warned that if the United States withdraws from a
close association with China ``it leaves the field to the Soviet
Union and Japan.''
   Lord, who held a key State Department post in the Nixon
administration and accompanied Kissinger on his trips to China in
the 1970s, disagreed.
   ``He's just wrong on this,'' Lord said.
   ``There is no way the Chinese and the Soviets are going to get
very close together,'' he said. ``You have geopolitical disputes.
You have ethnic populations across a disputed boundary. You've got
competition around the world.''
   Japan's occupation of China in World War II has left ``real
scars'' even a half-century later, Lord said.
   ``Those are not going away and China will always want us in Asia
to balance off Japan and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Lord did not propose Bush break ties with China. And, he said,
the president acted in good faith in twice sending Scowcroft to
Beijing.
   ``He knew the Scowcroft missions would be unpopular at home,''
Lord said. ``He tried to break the logjam in China.''
   Lord said U.S. policy should be to maintain contact with Beijing
but it should be ``a cool, working type relationship, and not one
filled with tawdry symbolism and high-level contacts and unilateral
gestures.''

<HEAD>Chilean Wines Withheld After Discovery of Illegal Ingredient</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists on Friday ordered stocks of 14 Chilean
wines withheld from sale after discovering unacceptably high levels
of a sweetener in them.
   The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said scientists
found unacceptable levels of sorbitol, a sweetener found naturally
in apple or pear juice but banned from wine because it can change
the flavor.
   The Wine Standards Board, which enforces European Community
regulations, ordered the 14 wines to be withheld while more tests
were carried out, said a ministry spokesman, who by custom was not
identified.
   ``The ministry is acting to safeguard the integrity of wine. The
presence of sorbitol suggests that fruit juice was added in making
the wine or that sorbitol was added,'' said the spokesman.
   Local authorities have also been asked to carry out checks to
see if stocks in stores broke the rules, the spokesman said.
   Chile is the largest South American exporter of wine to Britain,
selling 2 million bottles a year, according to the Wine and Spirits
Association.
   In March 1989, the United States ordered Chilean grapes held in
U.S. ports or removed from store shelves after traces of cyanide
were found in two grapes. No further contamination was found, and
shipments resumed.
   About 6 million crates of grapes were dumped during the health
scare.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Rainer
Eppelmann, hoping to ease Soviet concerns on German unification, on
Friday stressed that East Germany will honor its Warsaw Pact
commitments.
   Meeting with the Warsaw Pact's top commander, Gen. Piotr Lushev,
Eppelmann said security interests of eastern neighbors would play a
key role in reunification talks, the official East German news
agency ADN said.
   West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said Friday that
Bonn received a message from Moscow expressing concern about a
quick unification.
   Eppelmann told the Soviet commander that even if a united
Germany was part of NATO, no troops from the Western military
alliance would be stationed between the Oder and Elbe rivers
pending formation of a pan-European security agreement, ADN said.
   The Elbe River forms part of the border between the Germanys
while the Oder separates East Germany from Poland.
   In a speech to parliament Thursday, Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere also underlined East Germany's duties toward the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. He avoided direct reference to NATO,
although the coalition government supports a united Germany's
membership in the Western alliance.
   The Soviet Union opposes NATO membership. But West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said the merged country must remain in
NATO.
   The NATO-Warsaw Pact question will be discussed at the
forthcoming ``four-plus-two'' talks between wartime allies, the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, and the two
Germanys.
   ADN also said Eppelmann, a former peace activist who was last
week named as East Germany's first civilian defense and disarmament
minister, had accepted an invitation to visit Moscow on May 9.

<HEAD>Museum Agrees to Return 18th Century Bible to Last of Mohicans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last of the Mohicans, who fought
beside Massachusetts farmers in the Revolutionary War and embraced
their Christianity, will get back a historic Bible presented to the
tribe in the 1700s.
   ``We felt it was the right thing to do,'' Frederic Winthrop Jr.,
director of a private historical group which has the Bible in its
museum here, said Friday after trustees agreed to return it to the
Stockbridge-Munsee tribe in northern Wisconsin.
   The remnants of the Mohican tribe became known as the
Stockbridge-Munsee after they were driven from the Berkshires.
   ``We are pretty elated,'' said Reginald Miller, tribal chairman.
``And the trustees know that we will take even better care of it
than they have, because it means so much to us.''
   Miller said the tribe, which first approached the Mission House
Museum 15 years ago, would display the Bible in its own museum in
Bowler, Wis. The museum chronicles the tribe's history from the
time it sought shelter in the Berkshires from marauding Mohawks and
embraced Christianity in the 1700s.
   The two-volume gold-embossed folio Bible was presented to the
tribe in 1745 by the Prince of Wales. Heiress Mable Choate, who
financed the restoration of the Mission House built by John
Sergeant, the first missionary to the Stockbridge Indians, bought
the Bible from an impoverished church in Red Springs, Wisc., in
1930 for $1,000. She willed it to the Mission House in 1948.
   The agreement still needs approval by the Probate Court and it
could be months before the Bible is actually returned, Winthrop
said, ``but we feel that it would be what Miss Choate would want.
... She bought the Bible as a good faith gesture to help the
tribe.''
   Winthrop, whose own family dates from the beginnings of the
Massachusetts colony, said the trustees were finally persuaded by
the inscription, which says the Bible was ``given to the Rev. John
Sergeant to remain to the use of the successors of those Indians
from generation to generation.''
   ``A lot of lawyers could have had a lot of fun with this, I
suppose,'' Winthrop said. ``But we have become convinced that since
there is a question of title, the benefit of doubt should rest with
the tribe since this religious artifact is very important to their
cultural heritage. For nearly 200 years they took very good care of
it and brought it with them on their long journey from
Massachusetts.''
   The tribe left Stockbridge in 1785, forced out by the settlers
who were buying up their land. They moved to New York and Indiana
before settling about 60 miles north of Green Bay, Wis.
   The town of Stockbridge, later painted by Norman Rockwell, was
founded in the 1730s as a mission to the Indians at the invitation
of Chief Konkapot. The colonial legislature granted the tribe six
square miles.
   In return, the tribe was the only one to formally enlist on the
colonists' side in the Revolution. The Stockbridge unit fought from
the opening of hostilities at Concord in April 1775 until the war's
conclusion.

   A Kashmiri independence leader accused by the
United States of supporting terrorism denounced the Indian and
British governments at a Friday news conference. Afterward, he said
he was interrogated by the FBI.
   Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
told reporters that he had not been officially notified about
cancellation of his visa.
   The State Department said Thursday that it had revoked Khan's
visa because of his ``support for terrorist acts.''
   Khan said Friday's meeting with the FBI was his second.
   He described his conversations with the agency as ``an inquiry
sort of thing ... sort of a background check'' about himself and
the Liberation Front that had nothing to do with the announcement
of his visa being canceled.
   FBI official N.M. Michnyak declined to say whether the agency
had questioned Khan.
   At the news conference at the National Press Club, Khan said
``Indian forces have as much right to be in Kashmir as the Russians
in Afghanistan.''
   Disputing Indian charges that Pakistan provides training and
funds for his organization, he said Kashmiris want to be free of
both countries and to form an independent Asian ``Switzerland''
open to visitors from throughout the world.
   Incorporating predominantly Moslem Kashmir into British India,
the British ``sold us like cattle'' to the Hindu feudal nobility
that ``ruled us ruthlessly for 101 years.''
   Kashmire was made part of independent India in 1947.
   Khan said he arrived in the United States on April 1 in quest of
political and diplomatic support for his group's aim to get India
to uphold a 1947 agreement to a self-determination election in
Kashmir.
   He said the FBI agent who met him at the end of his news
conference had questioned him Wednesday, then telephoned him
Thursday. They agreed to meet at the Press Club, and Khan said they
spoke for about 90 minutes.
   Khan said he has visited the United States seven times and that
his current five-year multiple visa is valid until 1992.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said Khan's visa
cancellation does not become official until the attorney general is
notified. That action could come next week, said INS spokesman
Richard Kenney.
   Meanwhile, a source at the Indian Embassy said the Indian
government wants the United States to extradite Khan. The Indian
government alleges Khan is responsible for several killings and
attempted murders, kidnappings and terrorist activities.

   Attackers threw explosives at a Coptic
Orthodox church in a southern village, killing a sergeant and
injuring two other police guards, a security officer and the Middle
East News Agency said Friday.
   The slaying Thursday was the first in a series of attacks _ most
blamed on Moslem extremists _ on churches and Christian-owned
property in southern Egypt. The attacks have raised fears of
increasing intolerance toward Christians in the Moslem-dominated
nation.
   The attack occurred at dusk, when Moslems traditionally break
daylong fasts during the holy month of Ramadan, which ends next
week, said the Al-Akhbar newspaper in Cairo.
   Brig. Ahmed Galal said the identities and motives of the
assailants were unknown. More than 200 alleged Moslem extremists
were arrested after the previous incidents.
   The attack occurred Thursday night in the village of Sanhour
near the provincial capital of Fayoum, 60 miles south of Cairo.
   Galal, speaking by telephone from Fayoum, said assailants hurled
explosives at the church entrance where policemen stood guard,
killing the sergeant but not damaging the church.
   The state-owned news agency said three attackers on a motor
bicycle hurled an explosive device at the church.
   Fayoum, the hometown of a blind preacher, Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, has been a focus of violence by Moslem militants for
years. He is widely thought to lead Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, a Moslem
group that demands immediate implementation of Sharia, the
1,400-year-old Islamic religious and ethical code.
   The government has assigned police to Egypt's 1,500 churches
since an upsurge of Islamic militancy in the late 1970s that
culminated in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat by
Moslem extremists.
   Recently, Moslem militants have been active in the southern
provinces of Fayoum, Assiut and el-Minya, where there have been
riots, clashes with police, as well as arson and stoning attacks on
churches and other Coptic properties.
   Of Egypt's 55 million people, at least 5 million are Christians,
almost all Orthodox Copts. The evangelist St. Mark founded the
Coptic church in A.D. 40.
   There has been scattered strife between Egypt's Christian
minority and the Moslem majority since the seventh century Arab
conquest brought Islam to Egypt.

   Pickfair, the romantic estate where
legendary movie stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks once
reigned over Hollywood, has been demolished to build a palatial
home for actress Pia Zadora.
   Cherubs still guarded the gate Friday and vines and flowering
shrubs draped the curving wall surrounding the estate, but inside,
beyond a thicket of trees, stood only portions of the mansion amid
bins of rubble.
   Sounds of hammering and shouts of construction workers echoed
across the hillside where ``America's Sweetheart'' once hosted
parties for virtually all the legends of Hollywood's Golden Age as
well as royalty and presidents.
   The 2.7 acres that remain of the original 15-acre estate are now
owned by Miss Zadora and her millionaire husband, Meshulam Riklis.
They are building an elaborate mansion that will incorporate a
living room from the old house.
   ``A person hates to see part of an era, a very famous era, the
Pickfair, just sort of disappear very suddenly. But it's my feeling
it's not the end of an era,'' said Matty Kemp, longtime associate
of the late silent film star.
   It was not the house itself but Miss Pickford and Fairbanks, as
well as the company that Tinseltown's ``king and queen'' kept, that
made Pickfair what it was, said Kemp, who runs the Pickford Co.,
which continues to handle the late actress' films.
   ``The glamour came from the people, the celebrities of the day.
You name them _ Valentino, Swanson _ that's where the glamour was
at Pickfair.''
   Miss Pickford made her first movie in 1909, ``The Violin Maker
of Cremona,'' directed by D.W. Griffith. She was in more than 100
silent films, including ``Polyanna'' and ``Poor Little Rich Girl,''
before making her first talkie, ``Coquette,'' in 1929. It won her
an Oscar for best actress.
   She followed that with ``Taming of the Shrew'' and ``Kiki''
before ending her career with 1933's ``Secrets.'' The motion
picture academy gave her a special Oscar in 1976 for contribution
to the industry.
   Pickfair was built shortly after Miss Pickford married Fairbanks
in 1920. What was once a stable in the country and then a hunting
lodge was transformed into a gracious home that _ with some
exaggeration _ became known variously as the Buckingham Palace of
Hollywood or the White House.
   ``It was as famous as the White House in Washington,'' said
Kemp. ``Mary, during her reign as the queen, she was the most
popular woman in the world. My God, there wasn't anyone that didn't
know Mary Pickford.''
   An invitation to Pickfair meant you had arrived. Rudolph
Valentino and Gloria Swanson were just two names on a startling
guest list: Maurice Chevalier, Anna Pavlova, Charlie Chaplin, Clark
Gable, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Jack Dempsey, Albert Einstein,
Amelia Earhart, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth, Lillian
Gish and H.G. Wells.
   Miss Pickford was 86 when she died in 1979. Her marriage to
Fairbanks had ended in 1934 and she hadn't made a movie in nearly
50 years. But the mystique of Pickfair lingered on until the end.
   Her third husband, actor Buddy Rogers, several times called
reporters to the mansion to dispel rumors that Miss Pickford, who
became reclusive in the mid-1960s, was locked up. She spoke from an
upstairs room, using a tape-recorded message or telephone.
   ``I'm feeling so good that I'm ready to go back to work,'' she
said in one such interview in 1978. The mansion at that time was
reported to be ``in splendid repair, fully staffed and brimming
with legend.''
   After her death Rogers decided to sell Pickfair and built
himself a new house on a portion of the property. He called it
Pickfair Lodge and still lives there.
   Rogers, who was out of town Friday, sold the house to Jerry
Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, for $5.4 million in 1980. He
sold it to Miss Zadora and her husband in 1988 for $6.67 million.
   The couple announced last July that they were embarking on a
two-year remodeling project to transform the house into a
Renaissance-style Venetian palazzo with tile roofs, leaded windows,
balconies and verandas. The demolition work has been going on since
the beginning of the year.
   Now, however, only a separate guest house-servants quarters and
the old house's living room remain standing. The rest had simply
begun to crumble.
   ``I understand they ran into some problems with the foundations,
termites,'' said Kemp.

<HEAD>Columbia Crew Anxious To Get Discovery Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The astronauts who will operate an
observatory aboard the shuttle Columbia next month said Friday they
expect to beat the Discovery's Hubble Space Telescope in sending
back celestial clues.
   ``One of the things we've frequently reminded the space
telescope crew is that we will be sending down science data while
space telescope is still doing engineering checkout, and so we
should be able to beat them to the punch on getting down the first
science data,'' said mission specialist Robert Parker. ``We're
looking forward to being able to do that.''
   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuable
payload, is scheduled to head into orbit aboard Discovery on
Tuesday. Its first launch attempt was scrubbed shortly before
liftoff April 10 when a shuttle power unit failed.
   The two-week delay has pushed the shuttle Columbia's May 9
launch date back a week or two. In addition to seven astronauts,
four of them astronomers, Columbia will be carrying a $100 million
observatory called Astro that is intended to complement Hubble's
work.
   NASA plans to roll Columbia out to the launch pad Sunday, 1.6
miles from where Discovery awaits a Tuesday liftoff. It will be
only the second time that both of Kennedy Space Center's shuttle
launch pads have been occupied at the same time.
   Columbia and Challenger occupied the launch pads in January
1986. Ten days after Columbia landed, Challenger exploded.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is waiting for
Discovery to go up before setting a new launch date for Columbia.
   ``We tease the Hubble crew that if they don't get out of the
way, we're going to go ahead of them,'' said Air Force Col. Guy
Gardner, Columbia's pilot.
   Discovery's payload bay doors were reopened Friday, and
technicians began the daylong task of installing Hubble's
batteries. NASA completed 130 hours of recharging the six
nickel-hydrogen batteries in a laboratory on Thursday.
   NASA planned to test the batteries Saturday and seal the payload
bay later in the day. The countdown for Discovery was to begin
Saturday afternoon, with the five crew members returning to Kennedy
Space Center on Sunday.
   At a news conference, Columbia's astronauts readily agreed
Friday that the much-touted Hubble is the ``crown jewel'' of NASA's
astronomical endeavors. But they said Astro's three ultraviolet
instruments and broad band X-ray telescope also will shed light on
galaxies, black holes and quasars during the nine days of the
mission.
   While Hubble will be able to discern objects in space with
extraordinary clarity and allow astronomers to look back to almost
the beginning of time, Astro will have a wider field of view and be
better able to detect ultraviolet light. Astronomers expect Astro
to uncover targets on which Hubble can focus during the telescope's
15 years in orbit.
   Columbia mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman insists ``it's not a
competition'' between Hubble and Astro or between the crews. Still,
he can't resist ribbing Discovery's astronauts every now and then.
   ``We get to be astronomers,'' he said. ``All they do is throw
out a telescope. Anybody can do that.''

   The state Senate voted 34-23 Friday to
give final approval to a one-year ban on a hormone used to boost
cows' milk output, making Minnesota the second major milk-producing
state to do so.
   The Minnesota House passed the ban Thursday 68-59 despite
protests from the state's dairy farmers that the action would put
them at a competitive disadvantage.
   The measure follows a similar one approved by the Wisconsin
Legislature last month. Minnesota and Wisconsin combined produce
about 24 percent of the nation's milk.
   Rep. Chuck Brown, who led the charge for the moratorium in the
Minnesota House, said he has received assurances that Gov. Rudy
Perpich will sign the measure into law.
   Under the legislation, non-medical use of bovine growth hormone,
known as BGH or bovine somatotropin, would be banned for a year.
The protein is a synthetic version of a hormone that naturally
appears in cows and is expected to win approval of the Food and
Drug Administration for commercial use later this year.
   Brown and state Sen. Steve Morse urged the ban, saying more time
is needed to study the potential effects of the drug on animals and
humans.
   The legislation would keep the ban in effect as long as
Wisconsin enforced a similar moratorium or if a consortium of
states representing at least 40 percent of the nation's milk
production adopted a ban on BGH.
   The Wisconsin Legislature approved a temporary moratorium last
month that is awaiting the signature of Gov. Tommy Thompson. He has
not said whether he will sign the measure.
   The companies that produce the hormone, Monsanto Agriculture
Co., Eli Lilly Co., Upjohn Co. and American Cyanamid, have lobbied
against such measures, saying the hormone has been more than
adequately tested.
   Supporters of the synthetic hormone, including dairy farmers, a
pharmacist and a veterinarian, took issue with opponents'
contentions that the drug may not be safe and argued against
legislative impediments on new technology.
   ``There's no credible evidence that there's any health hazard,''
said Rep. Jim Girard. ``This is just another tool to allow farmers
to increase their production.''
   Rep. Harriet McPherson likened BGH to milk machines, embryo
transplants and other technological advances that have increased
milk production.

   An anti-censorship lobbying group said
Thursday that a new nationwide poll shows Americans overwhelmingly
support the National Endowment for the Arts and oppose conservative
lawmakers' efforts to curb federal support for controversial art.
   The poll results were released by the liberal People for the
American Way as a pornography-fighting preacher sent members of
Congress envelopes containing what he called ``filthy'' pictures of
homosexual acts from an Illinois art exhibit mounted with a $15,000
grant from the endowment.
   ``We're spending $175 million in this area that benefits
primarily the rich and the perverted,'' said the Rev. Donald
Wildmon, founder and director of the American Family Association of
Tupelo, Miss.
   Wildmon said he hopes the reproductions of 14 images from the
``David Wojnarowicz, Tongues of Flame'' show at the University
Galleries at Illinois State University in Normal will persuade
Congress to eliminate funds for the NEA.
   In an interview, endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer accused
Wildmon of using ``falsehoods or half-truths or intimidation'' to
whip up anti-NEA hysteria, and suggested that he ``pay attention to
the commandment against bearing false witness.''
   Frohnmayer said the Illinois art exhibit grant was made before
Congress banned federal support for obscene art. In any case, he
said, Wildmon was wrong to suggest that the NEA ``is a purveyor of
pornography or is somehow out of control.''
   The endowment, an independent federal agency with a budget of
$171.3 million, supports a wide variety of artists and artistic
institutions with tax-paid grants that must be matched by private
donors.
   The NEA has been the target of attacks by conservative lawmakers
led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., since last summer for its support for exhibits of
controversial works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano.
   Last fall, Congress voted to forbid NEA financing of art that
``may be considered'' obscene and without ``serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value.''
   The lawmakers also ordered a special commission created to
review the NEA's grant-making procedures, and withheld $45,000 from
the NEA as a penalty for supporting the Mapplethorpe and Serrano
exhibits.
   Officials of People for the American Way Action Fund, which
describes itself as a ``constitutional liberties organization''
fighting censorship, said their poll showed that ``the public
overwhelmingly opposes censorship of controversial art, even if
they find it personally offensive.''
   The poll was conducted for the group by Research &amp; Forecasts
Inc. of New York, which conducted random telephone surveys of 1,200
adults in late March.
   The firm said the poll showed that 68 percent of the public
supports federal financing of the arts and that only 30 percent
agrees that ``government funding to avant garde or leading-edge
artists should be stopped because a few people feel their work is
controversial.''
   The poll takers said 81 percent of those surveyed agreed that
``Congress should not pass laws that interfere with our rights to
free expression.'' They said 93 percent agreed that ``even if I
find a particular piece of art objectionable, others have the right
to view it.''
   Of those surveyed, they said, 61 percent take the NEA's side in
favoring the current system of having citizen panels make grant
decisions. Only 13 percent, they said, supported Helms' efforts to
slash funds and tighten controls over the endowment.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., hailed the poll results as ``a
welcome vote of confidence in the arts endowment'' and proof that
Americans ``reject the know-nothing censorship the right wing is
trying to impose.''
   But Rohrabacher said censorship was a phony issue. ``What we are
talking about is whether standards should be established so that
federal funds cannot be used to finance obscene or indecent art or
art that attacks religion,'' he said.
   Former Rep. John H. Buchanan, R-Ala., chairman of People for the
American Way, said he will circulate the poll results in Congress
to show that ``the American people say yes to the arts, yes to the
NEA and no to any government censorship of the arts or any other
form of free expression.''
   But Wildmon's anti-NEA campaign appeared to be succeeding among
some legislators.
   An aide to Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., said his office had
received up to 300 pieces of mail in the past week as a result of
Wildmon's letters to constituents. ``At this point, it's going to
be very difficult for us to vote to fund the NEA,'' said the aide,
Jeff de Korte.
   Meanwhile, a joint Soviet-American exhibi of contemporary art
opened Thursday at the Corcoran Gallery of Art minus three works by
New York artist Annette Lemiuex. She boycotted the show's
Washington appearance to protest the Corcoran's cancellation of the
Mapplethorpe exhibition last summer.

   Shaken hours after watching soldiers
take over her workplace Friday, journalist Maria Gediene swore that
Mikhail Gorbachev had met his match in Lithuania's stubborn,
non-violent resistance.
   ``He's a big actor,'' the middle-aged journalist said, a tear
rolling down her cheek. ``I see his game and it doesn't interest me
any more.''
   ``He doesn't know what the ending of this play will be, and
that's too bad for him,'' she added in a trembling voice. ``It will
be worse for him than for us.''
   Lithuanians interviewed on a dimly lighted street near the
requisite Soviet-era statue of Vladimir I. Lenin pledged they would
endure, despite an embargo on oil and natural gas that the
Lithuanian government said was spreading to tires, cable, packaging
and some food items.
   Lithuania imposed stiff gas rationing earlier Friday, limiting
each car to slightly under eight gallons a month. Long lines waited
at the gas pumps. Attendants stamped each car's registration as
they doled out the months's share.
   Officials warned of huge unemployment as factories are shut down
due to a lack of fuel, parts and raw materials from the Soviet
Union, which is continuing its opposition to Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   Citizens interviewed in the pleasant, cool spring evening said
they have not noticed any hoarding in expectation of shortages.
   Mrs. Gediene was present as Soviet Interior Ministry soldiers
took over a Communist Party publishing plant and beat some of the
civilian guards Friday afternoon.
   ``I don't know whether I'll be working there on Monday or not,''
she said.
   Daffodils and red carnations were placed at the foot of the
Lenin statue on a street that until recently was named for the
Soviet founder. Some traffic rumbled down what is now Gedimo
Street, named for an ancient Lithuanian king.
   An 18-year-old history student Vitas Batsis, tall, blond and
smiling, said few Lithuanians care about Lenin anymore.
   ``For Russians, he is God,'' said Batsis. ``That's
understandable. But for us, he's not God.''
   ``Let them do what they want,'' he said. ``We have only one
weapon, the truth.''
   Asked what would happen in the future, the student said: ``I
think there will be presidential rule, or we'll starve. But we'll
endure. We'll learn, like we're learning now.''
   Ethnic Russians agreed this Baltic republic of 3.8 million
people was headed for hard times, but charged it was all the fault
of the Lithuanian government. Two ethnic Russian women strolling
arm-in-arm down the street criticized the Lithuanian government for
moving too fast.
   ``Before declaring independence, you have to be able to stand on
your own feet,'' said 41-year-old teacher Lina Polotnova.
   ``It would be bad for all of us, but the Lithuanian government
is at fault,'' she said. ``Moscow is no way at fault.''
   The two women were both born in Lithuania, and Mrs. Polotnova
said she had no plans to leave despite the impending difficulties.
   But her friend, Vita Vishnyevskaya, said she and many other
Russians would leave if they could get new apartments somewhere in
Russia.
   Housing, most of it allocated rather sold, is in short supply
all over the Soviet Union.
   Both women said they were still able to buy in Vilnius stores
without any discrimination because they speak Lithuanian. And they
said they experienced no particular difficulties in everyday life.
   However, the ethnic strain was starting to show on 22-year-old
student Daira Arnshite of Klaipeda.
   ``I hate the Russians,'' she said. ``They turned us into
horrible people. We couldn't go anywhere, we didn't know anything,
we couldn't buy anything.''
   She and the other Lithuanians agreed that no possible solution
existed to the dispute with Moscow except full independence.
   ``We can negotiate about anything except independence,'' said
Mrs. Gediene. ``I don't think our parliament would be so bold as to
do that. The people would curse them.''

   A church barred a 5-year-old boy with AIDS from
Sunday school, then reversed itself Friday after an uproar.
   ``We love (him) and we want (him) back in our Sunday school and
(he) will be back in our Sunday school,'' the Rev. Erwin Lutzer,
senior pastor of the Moody Church, said at a hastily called news
conference.
   But Lutzer said other parents would be notified that a child
with AIDS would be attending Bible class, ``and they will have the
freedom to keep their children from Sunday school.''
   ``Our position and our concerns have not changed,'' Lutzer said.
``We have decided to shift the burden of responsibility from us as
a church.''
   The church had drawn fire when its decision to bar the boy
became public, a few weeks after the death of young AIDS victim
Ryan White.
   ``I'm pleased that they reversed themselves. ... I don't feel
any bitterness,'' the Chicago boy's foster mother, Terry Rucker,
said in a telephone interview Friday afternoon.
   Mrs. Rucker said she had not decided whether to return to the
church on Sunday. ``I have made no plans to go elsewhere,'' she
added.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Rucker had said the church officials' initial
decision stemmed ``from fear and ignorance.''
   Before announcing the reversal, the pastor said the 65-year-old
church had decided to bar the boy ``to give us time to think it
through.''
   His secretary, Evelyn Rankin, said officials of the
non-denominational evangelical church acted out of concern over how
AIDS is spread and fear it could be passed on through saliva.
   There has never been a documented U.S. case in which AIDS, which
cripples the body's defenses against disease, was spread through
saliva, said Charles Fallis, a spokesman for the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``We are well aware of Ryan White and the implication of his
death,'' Lutzer told reporters Friday.
   White, who had been barred from his school near Kokomo, Ind.,
after he contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, died April 8
at age 18. He had fought a long and public battle aimed at
increasing understanding of the disease.
   ``We thought with Ryan White, all that had been settled,'' Walt
Rucker said of his foster son. Rucker asked that the child's name
be kept private.
   ``That's just crazy,'' agreed Carrie Van Dyke, a friend and
spokeswoman for White's family in Indianapolis. ``Where is their
humanity to fellow man?
   ``I would think that they would be a little more introspective
about what they're doing.''
   The boy was born with the AIDS virus, said David Schneidman, a
spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services. The agency removed the boy from his mother, who has AIDS,
out of concern she could no longer care for him, Schneidman said.
   The Ruckers took the boy in two months ago. Mrs. Rucker
confirmed that he has contracted AIDS from the virus.
   John Hammell, director of the AIDS and Civil Liberties Project
of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said the
church's decision to bar the child likely would not have withstood
a legal challenge.
   ``It's very sad, especially ... since this is a religious
(institution) and should be a compassionate institution that this
still happens.''
   Rucker, a psychologist, said earlier that he and his wife, a
nurse, have belonged to Moody Church for 10 years.
   ``We strongly support the church's position on pro-life,''
Rucker said. ``We do not support the church's position on not
taking a child with AIDS.''
   The boy had been told only that he was ``not going back to Bible
class anymore,'' said Mrs. Rucker. ``This is a Bible-teaching
church, and they cannot justify their fears.''
   A receptionist at the church said the Moody Church and the Moody
Bible Institute are ``separate entities'' connected only in that
Dwight L. Moody founded both the church and the institute. She said
that while the institute contributes money to the church, the
church also helps the institute financially.
   AIDS is spread by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to
their infants before or during birth. Health officials have said
there has been no evidence that it can spread by casual contact.

   Lech Walesa won an overwhelming vote of
confidence from Solidarity's second national congress Friday after
delivering an impassioned defense of his 10 years as union leader.
   ``I am not the wisest guy, but we are wise because we now have a
democracy,'' Walesa said.
   Delegates responded by voting 357-1 in favor of a report on the
leadership of Walesa and the union movement's National Commission
since 1981. There were 22 abstentions.
   His name was later submitted to a union commission for
re-election, aides to Walesa said.
   Members of the election commission said several other names had
been submitted, but they declined to provide details. Some have
accused Walesa of undemocratic rule.
   Apart from the election of its leadership, the trade union
movement also was expected to try to clarify its union and
political roles in post-Communist Poland.
   Walesa's re-election appeared virtually certain.
   ``Walesa will guarantee that the union will not fall apart,''
said Ryszard Musielak, a delegate from the central city of Torun.
   ``It is very important that we passed this vote of confidence
because it shows there are no serious objections to Walesa's
activities among the delegates,'' said Antoni Bielewicz of the
Warsaw region.
   Later, the congress rejected a motion to create a vice chairman
who would take over if the chairman assumed other duties. But the
post still could be introduced if union statutes were changed.
   Last week, Walesa raised the possibility of running for
president.
   Walesa's address came on the second day of Solidarity's six-day
congress, the second one it has held.
   Since the first congress in 1981, the movement has survived
martial law, negotiated an end to Communist dominance, and won
elections to take control of the government.
   Recent public opinion polls, however, show Solidarity losing
popularity as Poland undergoes austerity measures that have
increased unemployment. Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1983 for his efforts as Solidarity leader, remains very popular.
   In an emotional speech Friday, Walesa acknowledged mistakes had
been made.
   ``The victory I am giving you. The mistakes are ours and you
should correct all the mistakes we've made here and today,'' Walesa
said.
   ``I did this only for Poland. ... It's not my victory, it's our
mutual victory. I was only the driver of it all,'' he said.
   Several delegates later accused Walesa of diminishing the
achievements of others who helped found the union.
   Parliament member Andrzej Malachowski, however, received a
standing ovation when he called for an end to backroom politicking.
   ``Of course you, Lech, have enemies, but some game is being
engineered here,'' Malachowski said. ``Stop it, please. Lech Walesa
has well served the fatherland.''
   After the confidence vote, the delegates changed ``Lechu!
Lechu!'' as Walesa raised his arms in a victory salute.
   Walesa, an electrician at the Gdansk shipyard, became leader of
Solidarity in 1980 by climbing over the shipyard fence during a
strike to galvanize the workers.
   ``Due to bad luck, I jumped over the shipyard wall,'' he said
Friday. ``You liked my jump and that's why you elected me to drive
this vehicle called Solidarity.''
   Before Walesa's speech, the congress debated more than an hour
before voting to admit as guests all members of the 1981 union
leadership who no longer were delegates. The guests would not be
permitted to vote.
   The former leaders include several radicals who have broken with
the Solidarity mainstream.
   Some had accused Walesa of undemocratic rule. Others had opposed
any compromise with the former Communist government, including the
negotiations that led to elections in June. That vote resulted in
the East bloc's first non-Communist-led government.
   Walesa threatened to leave the hall Friday if certain members of
the former leadership showed up. He did not specify who he meant.
   The union regained legal status April 17, 1989, then took
control of the government after partly free elections in June.
   Solidarity has since managed to sign up only 2.2 million of the
10 million members it had in 1981. Opinion polls show confidence
dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships associated with
the strict austerity program of the Solidarity-led government.
   Economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising
unemployment among the industrial workers who are the backbone of
Solidarity's support.
   Walesa has criticized the pace of political reforms, saying
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's team is not moving quickly
enough to dislodge Communists from power in state enterprises and
government ministries.
   The delegates are expected to debate how much they want
Solidarity to be confined to union issues and whether to create a
Solidarity-linked political party.

   Homosexuals from southern and
eastern Europe on Friday met in Leipzig for a three-day conference
to discuss problems gays face in Communist and former Communist
nations.
   Criminal prosecution and forming a ``minority'' in society were
high on the conference agenda, the official East German news agency
ADN said.
   Leipzig was the center of many of last year's East German
protests against 40 years of hard-line Communist rule.
   Despite reform in Eastern Europe, ADN said homosexuals from the
Soviet Union were attending secretly, using cover addresses.
   Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and the Soviet Union are among
countries where homosexuality is a criminal offense.
   For many years homosexuals were persecuted in East Germany,
although the hard-line government of former Communist chief Erich
Honecker relaxed its attitude and allowed cafes and clubs catering
to gays to open in 1987.
   Homosexuality was legalized in East Germany last year, ADN said.

   Read their lips _ the people competing in
the 17th annual National Whistlers Convention take the art
seriously.
   ``We once thought that this was a rural kind of art found in
small towns or Americana,'' said Allen De Hart, founder and
director of the competition held in Louisburg, about 30 miles north
of Raleigh. But he said the contest attracts people of all ages and
economic and ethnic backgrounds.
   ``Obviously the art is like the art of music _ it has no
limitations,'' he said. ``People with all kinds of interests and
backgrounds whistle.''
   On Saturday, the 1989 national grand champion whistler, Sean
Lomax, a 28-year-old computer specialist on a submarine based at
Pearl Harbor, will defend his title.
   He won last year by whistling ``Dance Boheme'' from ``Carmen''
and ``The Entertainer'' from the movie ``The Sting.'' Lomax will
open this year's contest with the national anthem.
   The 58 contestants competing this year range in age from 3 to 88
and come from 20 states. Categories include best child whistler and
best supporting whistler. Prize money this year totals $2,500,
which won't make anyone wealthy, but De Hart says winners receive
national attention.
   ``All of our whistlers sooner or later get on some kind of a
show, either the Johnny Carson show or the David Letterman show,''
De Hart said.

   Liz and Len Zedel are
sleeping in the living room these days because the occupants
downstairs are noisy and smell like fish.
   The couple rent a cottage in this Victoria suburb two blocks
from the ocean and near a small creek. About two weeks ago, they
heard puppy-like whimpering under the bedroom floor.
   ``We thought it was 'coons or something,'' says Zedel, an
oceanographer at the Institute of Ocean Studies. Then one day, ``I
was brushing my teeth, looked out the window and was nose-to-nose
with an otter,'' he said.
   The couple soon found that a whole litter was being raised under
the house. The landlord tried to block off the entrance to the lair
with boards, but the adults dismantled the obstruction in five
minutes, Ms. Zedel said.
   Ms. Zedel, an opera singer who performs under the name Elizabeth
Planje, said she practices scales and arias every morning and it
doesn't seem to bother the river otters.
   However, she's had to use some potpourri to freshen up the
bedroom, which she said smells ``a bit fishy.''
   The couple said they would sleep in the living room until the
young otters grow up and move out. Wildlife expert Alex Matheson
said that should take about three months.

   Jerry Lewis and Jerry Erwin have $500
riding on a hair-raising bet they made in 1963: Which man will
shave off his beard first?
   The winner, if there ever is one, undoubtedly will claim victory
by a whisker.
   The wager began 27 years ago when both men decided to grow
beards in honor of West Virginia's 1963 centennial celebration.
Both shaved when the festivities were over, but soon grew back
their beards because, as Lewis explained, ``when I shaved if off, I
felt naked.''
   To make things interesting, Lewis and Erwin bet $100 on who
would be the first to shave. Neither has since, and as the beards
have grown, so has the pot, to $500.
   ``That's because of inflation,'' Lewis said.
   Lewis keeps his beard trimmed to about 5 inches. Erwin's,
without a moustache, is about 9 inches long.
   Neither Lewis nor Erwin, who work together at a Boone County
automobile towing shop, will predict who'll be the first to come
clean-shaven. When asked recently, both just smiled and stroked
their fluffy beards.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly
returned home on Friday and ruled out yielding to the demands of
hostage-holders.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had called for
Kelly to go to Damascus, the capital of Syria, to handle final
details of the release of an American hostage.
   When the request was turned down by the Bush administration, the
militant group said the release had been postponed.
   Kelly, in a statement at Washington Dulles International
Airport, said Edward P. Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador to Syria,
was at his post and ``fully capable of handling all the details of
bringing a hostage out safely, and quickly, and efficiently.''
   Kelly and Djerejian had been in West Germany attending a
conference of American diplomats.
   Kelly's statement did not indicate with whom the Bush
administration was prepared to have Djerejian deal.
   Administration spokesmen have flatly ruled out negotiating with
hostage-holders. Kelly evidently was referring to Syria, which is
serving as an intermediary for the United States.
   In his statement, the American diplomat stressed there would be
no yielding to the demands of hostage-holders.
   ``You know American policy is that we do not make concessions to
those who hold the hostages,'' he said. ``We want the hostages out,
but we are not going to bow to the demands of the hostage-holders.''
   Kelly voiced hope a hostage would be released. He described
Djerejian, an Arabic and French-speaking career diplomat, as ``a
very competent, seasoned, professional ambassador'' knowledgeable
about Lebanon and Syria.
   Explaining why he did not go to Syria, the assistant secretary
of state said ``there was no particular utility in my going to
Damascus because Ambassador Djerejian is fully capable of handling
all the details there.''
   Kelly has also served in Lebanon as U.S. ambassador.
   His explanation was milder than that given by U.S. officials
earlier in the week.
   They said sending Kelly to Damascus would have meant yielding to
demands of the Islamic Jihad and that even if Kelly did not engage
in negotiations his presence in Syria might give that impression.
   President Bush on Thursday said the United States ``would not
knuckle under to demands.''

   Mexican authorities will prosecute anyone
responsible for the purported abduction of a Mexican doctor to the
United States to face charges in the murder of a U.S. drug agent,
the attorney general said Friday.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo also reiterated an
earlier threat that Mexico will stop cooperating with the United
States in the war on drugs if further abductions take place on
Mexican territory.
   ``There must be respect. Otherwise, there is no cooperation,''
he said.
   Alvarez del Castillo said no charges are pending in Mexico
against Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, 42, who has been indicted in
the United States in the torture-murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   Alvarez Machain's lawyer says he was abducted from his office in
Guadalajara and flown to El Paso, Texas, where DEA agents arrested
him.
   Alvarez Machain pleaded innocent to any involvement in the 1985
Camarena killing near Guadaljara, capital of western Jalisco state.
   The attorney general said anyone suspected of involvement in a
kidnapping will be prosecuted no matter what their rank, position
in government or nationality.
   ``We are investigating thoroughly, and anyone found to be
responsible will be investigated, arrested and prosecuted,''
Alvarez del Castillo told a news conference.
   He said chances of returning Alvarez Machain to Mexico are
``very complicated'' but refused to comment further.
   In Washington, a Justice Department spokesman said Alvarez
Machain would not be returned even if he was kidnapped. U.S. courts
long have held that a fugitive can stand trial in the United States
even arrested improperly abroad.
   Alvarez del Castillo spoke at the end of a four-day conference
on drug-fighting by the Organization of American States, over which
he presided. U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh attended the
conference opening and returned to Washington on Thursday. He
ordered the DEA to give him a full report on the Alvarez Machain
arrest.
   Justice spokesman David Runkel said Thornburgh had reassured
Mexican officials, including Alvarez del Castillo, and that the
Americans ``were assured that relations between Mexico and the
United Sates remained strong and that cooperation on drug law
enforcement would continue.''
   Mexican officials at the conference have been privately
criticizing the idea of apprehending drug suspects abroad, based on
a U.S. Supreme Court decision that such arrests are legal.
   Without mentioning the United States by name, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari on Thursday criticized the police, saying
nations should not take drug-fighting as an excuse for such illicit
actions abroad.
   ``In the fight against drugs, the law is rendered useless by
illegal actions, or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of
one country in foreign territory,'' Salinas told the conference.
   The conference was attended by justice ministers, or their
representatives, from 32 OAS member nations.

   The Justice Department said Friday it has no
plans to return to Mexico a doctor accused of participating in the
murder of a U.S. drug agent even if his capture violated Mexican
sovereignty.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he ``did not
foresee any circumstances'' under which Dr. Humberto Alvarez
Machain would be returned to Mexico rather than face federal
charges in Los Angeles.
   But the judge overseeing the case ordered the Justice Department
to explain the circumstances leading up to Alvarez' April 3 arrest
in El Paso, Texas, on charges of participating in the 1985 murder
of drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   The Mexican government also has demanded an explanation for what
an embassy spokesman here called the ``illegal detention'' of the
Guadalajara gynecologist.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburg issued a statement on the
apprehension of Dr. Machain, that was read by spokesman Dan Eramian:
   ``Although the Drug Enforcement Administration has not completed
its investigation of the circumstances surrounding the apprehension
of Dr. Machain, it has been confirmed that no DEA personnel were
present when he was taken into custody in Mexico or when he was
boarded onto an aircraft in that country.
   ``In addition, no DEA personnel were aboard the aircraft that
brought Dr. Machain to the United States.
   ``The first encounter DEA agents had with Dr. Machain was when
they took him into custody at the El Paso, Texas, airport.''
   Eramian refused the answer questions.
   The defense lawyer in the case charges that Alvarez was
kidnapped and flown by private plane to El Paso, where he was
arrested by DEA agents.
   DEA officials have denied published reports that it paid bounty
hunters to capture Alvarez and bring him to the U.S. border. DEA
officials have declined to describe how they arrested Alvarez.
   A prosecutor handling the case, however, said in court Thursday
in Los Angeles that the U.S. government ``has had standing offers
on the street in Mexico and Guadalajara for rewards'' for the
capture of those involved in the Camarena murder.
   The arrest has sparked a diplomatic protest from the government
of Mexico. The Mexican attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo, said it could end U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drug
enforcement.
   Runkel said that threat was dispelled by talks between
Thornburgh and his Mexican counterpart this week in Ixtapa, Mexico,
the site of a hemispheric conference on drug enforcement.
   ``We were assured that relations between Mexico and the United
States remained strong and that cooperation on drug law enforcement
would continue,'' Runkel said.
   ``Any threat, if one existed, to continued cooperation was
substantially lessened as a result of the bilateral talks in
Ixtapa,'' Runkel said.
   Thornburgh has asked DEA for a full account of the arrest and
assured Mexico that ``appropriate action would be forthcoming when
a report of the results of that investigation was in hand,'' Runkel
said.
   A spokesman for the Mexican Embassy here said future cooperation
on drug enforcement would have to await the result of the
investigation into the circumstances surrounding Alvarez's arrest.
   ``There is cooperation to find who the real violators of the
Mexican law are in this case of the illegal detention of Alvarez
Machain,'' said Javier Trevino, the embassy's press attache.
   ``Once this investigation is over and those responsible are duly
punished cooperation will continue,'' Trevino said.
   Runkel declined to say what action might be taken by the
attorney general once he received DEA's report.
   But he said ``I don't foresee any circumstances under which he
would be returned to Mexico,'' Runkel said. ``He faces criminal
charges in this country.''
   A long line of U.S. court decisions have held that a fugitive
can stand trial in this country even if his arrest overseas was
improper or illegal.
   A Justice Department legal opinion issued earlier this year said
the FBI had the authority to grab fugitives in other countries
without the permission of the host government.

   It's curtains for The Whole Theater,
which rose to national prominence with a push from Oscar-winner
Olympia Dukakis, it was announced Friday.
   ``We're hoping that it's not a sign of things to come for other
theater groups, but we have to realize the state is seeing some
tough times,'' said Laura Aden, executive director of the New
Jersey Theater Group.
   The Whole Theater was founded in 1973 by a group of married
theater couples, including Ms. Dukakis and her husband, actor Louis
Zorich. It won national acclaim for original programming and
quality acting, and attracted even more attention with the Academy
Award won by Ms. Dukakis in 1988 for her role in ``Moonstruck.''
   In a plot twist laced with irony, however, the theater that
lived by Ms. Dukakis may die by Ms. Dukakis.
   The Whole Theater's association with the actress may have lulled
would-be donors into believing it was financially sound, said
theater spokeswoman Bonnie Kramen.
   ``Some people may have thought that with the increased
visibility, there were increased dollars coming in, and that didn't
turn out to be the case,'' Ms. Kramen said.
   The theater's Board of Trustees determined Wednesday that the
building would have to be sold to pay off debts of about $450,000,
Ms. Kramen said.
   ``Our Town'' was the theater's first production in 1973.
   Ms. Dukakis could not be reached directly for comment, but
issued a statement.
   ``However much I regret that this decision had to be made, I
feel the board of trustees of Whole Theater made the most
responsible decision possible under these circumstances,'' she said.

   An earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale
that hit far western China near the Soviet border caused the
collapse of 1,300 houses, seismology officials said Friday.
   However, only two people were injured in the Tuesday morning
quake in the mountains of West Wuqia, in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, quoting the Xinjiang Seismology
Bureau, did not say how seriously the two were injured or why the
extent of damage wasn't worse.
   It also said 47 head of livestock were killed by the quake.
   The area affected by the quake has been closed to foreign
travelers and journalists in recent weeks following reports that
Chinese troops had been called in to put down rioting by Moslem
ethnic groups.
   A bureau official said the quake was about 40 miles southwest of
Wuqia and 60 miles from the Soviet border.
   He said residents of Kashgar, a famed bazaar town of about
100,000 people about 60 miles from the epicenter, reported little
structural damage.
   Much of the quake damage was to homes constructed of mud bricks
and flimsy roofing materials.

   Here is a chronology of major developments in the prosecution of
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken:
   Nov. 14, 1986 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky pays $100 million
to settle charges of insider trading on information supplied by
investment banker Dennis Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to
cooperate with investigators and to plead guilty to a single
criminal charge. Boesky later is sentenced to three years in prison.
   Late 1986 _ Published reports link Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
high-yield bond financier Michael Milken to an illegal insider
trading network led by Boesky.
   Sept. 7, 1988 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
Drexel, Milken and three others of violating a wide range of
securities laws, most of them in connection with Boesky.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud case in history. Drexel also must settle
related SEC charges and cooperate with the government investigation.
   March 29, 1989 _ A federal grand jury indicts Milken, his
brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg on 98
counts of racketeering and fraud largely based on information
supplied by Boesky. Potential penalties and fines under the counts
amount to about $12 billion plus possible prison terms.
   April 7 _ The Milkens plead innocent. Newberg enters an innocent
plea later.
   April 13 _ Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
   June 15 _ Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his
own consulting firm. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing
law.
   Sept. 11 _ Drexel pleads guilty to six felonies and begins
paying more than $650 million in fines, penalties and interest.
   Feb. 13, 1990 _ Drexel's parent company files for federal
bankruptcy court protection after failing to meet short-term debt
payments. The securities firm, once the nation's fifth-largest,
starts laying off its 5,400 employees.
   March 19 _ Prosecutors promise to bring a new indictment with
broader charges against Milken by the week of April 16.
   April 4 _ Boesky is released from federal custody after
completing two years of a three-year term.
   April 19 _ Four months of negotiations intensify between the
government and Milken for a possible plea bargain to settle the
case as a deadline looms for the new indictment.
   April 20 _ Sources say Milken agrees to plead guilty to six
felony counts and pay fines and restitution totaling $600 million
under a plea agreement with prosecutors.

   Greyhound said Friday that a reduced workload
caused by a 7-week-old strike by bus drivers has forced it to lay
off almost one-fifth of its maintenance force.
   Union officials said the layoffs were a sign the company is
struggling.
   ``Because of the present volume of business, we have more
mechanics than we need,'' said Greyhound Lines Inc. spokesman
George Gravley. ``It's not that we can't pay them, we don't want to
pay them if there's no work to do.''
   He said 275 of the current 1,395 mechanics, mechanics helpers,
storekeepers, truck drivers and service workers were being laid off
beginning Monday.
   Before the strike, Greyhound had 2,165 maintenance workers. Of
those, the 690 represented by the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers remained on the job. Gravley said
695 ATU members also ignored the strike.
   The layoffs are spread throughout the country and involve 120
Machinists and 155 ATU members, he said. The workers would be
recalled as work loads increase, he said.
   ``Every indicator points to financial disaster for Greyhound
Lines Inc.,'' said James La Sala, international president of the
Amalgamated Transit Union. ``Greyhound management is now at a
crossroads. It can either negotiate a settlement to this contract
dispute, or allow this country's only national bus system to slide
into financial ruin.''
   The ATU, which also represents about 6,300 drivers and 1,660
office workers, has been on strike since March 2, walking out in a
dispute over wages and job security. There have been no
negotiations since mid-March. Greyhound has refused to meet with
union representatives until seven straight days have passed without
violence.
   The latest incident occurred Wednesday, Gravley said, when a bus
traveling from Dallas to Oklahoma City, Okla., was struck by two
bullets.
   The company has been operating reduced schedules, using
replacement workers and crossovers, and says it currently is
carrying about two-thirds as many passengers as it was at this time
last year.

   A church barred a 5-year-old boy with AIDS from
Sunday school, then reversed itself Friday after an uproar.
   ``We love (him) and we want (him) back in our Sunday school and
(he) will be back in our Sunday school,'' the Rev. Erwin Lutzer,
senior pastor of the Moody Church, said at a hastily called news
conference.
   But Lutzer said other parents would be notified that a child
with AIDS would be attending Bible class, ``and they will have the
freedom to keep their children from Sunday school.''
   ``Our position and our concerns have not changed,'' Lutzer said.
``We have decided to shift the burden of responsibility from us as
a church.''
   The church had drawn fire when its decision to bar the boy
became public, a few weeks after the death of young AIDS victim
Ryan White.
   ``I'm pleased that they reversed themselves. ... I don't feel
any bitterness,'' the Chicago boy's foster mother, Terry Rucker,
said in a telephone interview Friday afternoon.

   Farmland prices rose again last year but at a
slower pace than in 1988, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said that as of Jan.
1 the average value of U.S. farmland, including buildings, was $693
per acre, up 4 percent from Feb. 1, 1989. The February figure was
not given.
   An 11-month period was used because the agency is switching from
Feb. 1 to Jan. 1 as the reporting date.
   ``Although below the 6 percent gain in 1988, last year's rise
was the third straight increase,'' the agency reported.
   Despite the annual increases, U.S. farmland values are still 16
percent below the record of $823 per acre in 1982. Prices sank to a
19-year low of $548 per acre in 1987 before gaining 3 percent in
1988.
   Analysts said 1989 was a good income year for farmers nationally
and that debt was down 29 percent from its earlier peak. Farm real
estate interest rates in 1989 were about the same as in 1988.
   Thus, they said, farmland values ``should have increased
strongly'' last year. But there were other factors at work, too.
   ``The combination of a relatively modest increase in farmland
values with the positive income and debt indicators suggests
farmland investors anticipated the 1989 conditions, and the
farmland value increases in 1987 and 1988 reflected those
anticipations,'' the report said.
   ``Also, uncertainty about changes in the capital gains tax,
changes in income and price supports, movements in interest rates,
and outcomes of the (global) trade liberalization negotiations may
have made investors cautious about projecting 1989 income levels
into the future,'' it said.
   No state breakdown of farmland values was included in the
report. But analysts said farmland values rose in eight of the 10
farm production regions, although there was a wide variation.
   Corn Belt land values averaged 2 percent higher on Jan. 1, far
below the 10 percent gain of the previous year. The Mississippi
Delta states were about 1 percent higher, while the Northeast was
about unchanged.
   ``Led by a 15 percent gain in South Dakota, values in the
Northern Plains rose 8 percent, about the same as a year earlier,''
the report said. ``Value increases also were similar to a year ago
in the Southeast (8 percent), Appalachia (7 percent), the Lake
States (6 percent), and the Pacific Region (6 percent).''
   Farmland values in the Mountain region were reported up 5
percent, compared with 2 percent a year earlier, including a 16
percent gain in Montana and 14 percent in Idaho.

<HEAD>Elderly Gallipoli Veterans to Return to Famous WWI Battlefield</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Veterans of World War I who fought in
the Gallipoli campaign left Friday for Turkey to commemorate one of
the worst Allied defeats in the ``war to end all wars.''
   The 46 Australians, aged 90 to 103, took off on a specially
outfitted Qantas Airways Boeing 747-300. The plane was equipped
with a mini-hospital, including Royal Australian Air Force doctors,
to care for the veterans in case of medical emergency.
   The journey for the ceremonies on Wednesday will include a
30-hour stop in Singapore to give the veterans a rest break. The
trip, scheduled for arrival Sunday in Istanbul, is expected to be
difficult for some.
   Unlike their crowded wartime trip in a troop ship, the veterans
traveled first class in front of the plane while Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and other government representatives sat in the rear of the
jet.
   Some reflected on their first voyage.
   ``We thought it was a glorious chance to see the world for
nothing,'' said 92-year-old Jack Hazlitt, who was a ``runner,'' or
military cables dispatcher. ``That attitude didn't last long. Very
few of us survived. You could say I'm one of the lucky ones.''
   Gallipoli is the Turkish peninsula on the northern side of the
Dardanelles Strait. Allied forces consisting of the Britain,
Australia, New Zealand, French and Indian troops invaded in 1915 in
an attempt to open the straits to Russia, capture Istanbul, then
known as Constantinople, and sever the Ottoman Turkish Empire from
its ally, Germany.
   Allied forces fought unsuccessfully for nine months and were
forced to evacuate in December 1915 and January 1916.
   Allied casualties were 33,532 killed, 78,518 wounded and 7,689
missing, including 8,587 Australians killed and 19,367 wounded.
   Most of the Australian soldiers were called ``diggers,'' and
93-year-old George Mitchell said the term developed because ``all
we did (when not fighting) was to dig, dig and dig trenches.''
   The battle gave the Turks a modern hero, Kemal Ataturk, who made
his name as a military genius in Gallipoli.
   Australia commemorates the campaign each year with a national
day of remembrance for those killed in the WWI and for those who
died in other wars.
   ``In the Australian consciousness, two things stand out about
Gallipoli,'' said Bob Carr, leader of the Labor opposition in the
state of New South Wales. ``First, the courage and valor of our
troops, and second, that it was a defeat, a military disaster.''

<HEAD>Secretary-General to Visit Albania in Mid-May</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
will visit the isolated Stalinist country of Albania in mid-May,
U.N. officials confirmed Friday.
   It will be the first trip by a U.N. secretary-general to
Albania, the last bastion of hard-line Communism in Eastern Europe.
   In recent weeks, Albania has made several recent moves to
increase ties with the West, including the re-establishment of
telephone communications with the United States and several other
Western nations.
   Albanian Foreign Minister Reis Malile invited Perez de Cuellar
to travel to his country when he visited the U.N. General Assembly
in October.
   The visit had been announced officially last month and there
were no further details available Friday except that the officials
said the U.N. chief is expected to spend two days in Albania.
   U.N. officials said Perez de Cuellar was also planning trips in
May to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, two East bloc countries that
have moved to end four decades of Communist rule.
   A visit to Albania, a nation accused of serious human rights
abuses, would make Perez de Cuellar one of the most senior
international officials to visit the rigid Communist state in
recent years.
   Albania, lying between Greece and Yugoslavia on the Adriatic
Sea, is one of the most isolated countries in the world. Albanian
authorities strictly limit foreign visitors and tightly control
access to foreign broadcasts and books.
   Despite the restrictions, there have been indications of moves
toward opening to the outside world since the death in 1985 of
Albanian hard-line leader Enver Hoxha. Hoxha broke relations with
the Soviet Union in 1961 because of Nikita Krushchev's dismantling
of Stalinism.

   A Florida lawyer charged with plotting the
1988 kidnapping of a millionaire heiress was sentenced Friday to 19
years in prison without parole.
   Annie Laurie Hearin, the 74-year-old wife of Jackson
multimillionaire Robert M. Hearin, has not been seen since she
disappeared from her home July 26, 1988.
   Newton Alfred Winn, 65, a St. Petersburg, Fla., lawyer, was
convicted of conspiracy for having a ransom letter mailed from
Atlanta on Aug. 11, 1988. He also was charged with extortion and
lying to a federal grand jury about his knowledge of Mrs. Hearin's
disappearance.
   No one has been charged with the actual kidnapping.
   Winn and 11 other people once associated with Hearin's School
Pictures business allegedly split the $1 million that was demanded
for Mrs. Hearin's release. Winn returned his check to Hearin.
   U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee. imposed the 19-year, seven-month
sentence and added five years' probation.
   Hearin declined to answer questions after the sentencing.
   Prosecutors contended during the trial that Winn blamed Hearin
for his financial losses in School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., in
which Hearin was a primary stockholder and former chairman.
Prosecutors said the business deal led Winn to bankruptcy and the
loss of his law office.
   At Friday's hearing, Winn criticized the FBI, saying it had made
a scapegoat of him.
   ``The FBI is the culprit in this case,'' Winn said. ``I have no
personal knowledge of this crime. I am not guilty of anything in
this matter.''
   He said the FBI ``by hook and crook'' found people to testify
against him and the jury believed ``the uncollaborated and false
testimony.''

   Gospel singer Sandi Patti says she felt
victimized by the arson attack that destroyed her office.
   The anonymous caller told the Anderson Herald Bulletin her group
started the blaze because Patti had ``put herself on the pedestal
of God.''
   ``It's one of the most paralyzing feelings I have ever felt in
my life,'' Patti said outside her charred office Thursday, two days
after the fire.
   ``There's a tendency to just kind of sit at home and close the
door and think `I will never be able to walk outside again.' I
don't want to feel like that the rest of my life,'' she said.
   A group, calling itself the ``Equal Religious Coalition,''
claimed responsibility for the fire. Anderson police said they had
never heard of the group but were taking the claim seriously.
   An unidentified woman said the fire was set in the office ``in
objection to Mrs. Patti's blatancy to continue to put herself on
the pedestal of God.''
   Patti, her husband, John Helverling, and their four children are
getting protection from off-duty officers. The office, operated by
Helverlin, handles mail distribution of Patti's records, tapes and
T-shirts, but master recordings of Patti's albums survived in a
vault.

<TEXT>
   The family of the late Hank Gathers filed a
$32.5 million lawsuit Friday against Loyola Marymount University,
coach Paul Westhead and 12 others, accusing them of negligence in
the basketball star's death.
   The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that Gathers' heart
medication was reduced at Westhead's request because the player's
performance was suffering; that Gathers was not made aware of the
risk he faced if he continued to play basketball, and that he was
not treated quickly enough when he collapsed March 4 during the
Lions' West Coast Conference tournament game.
   Gathers, the nation's leading scorer and rebounder a year
earlier, died of heart disease hours later.
   Loyola Marymount spokesman Joan Gaulene said university
officials expect to be vindicated.
   ``Loyola Marymount University is deeply saddened by the charges
leveled at the university and the university staff in the suit
filed today by attorney Bruce Fagel on behalf of the family of Hank
Gathers,'' she said in a statement. Gaulene said the university's
lawyers had not had enough time to review all the allegations and
could not comment further.
   Westhead said in a statement Friday: ``As his coach, I did my
best for Hank Gathers. I was never part of the medical decisions
concerning Hank. I did not decide what medication to prescribe or
what dosage to take.
   ``I feel badly that my relationship with Hank and his family
could be distorted with this legal action.''
   Contained in the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court,
was the excerpt of a letter sent by one of Gathers' doctors, Vernon
Hattori, to another, Dr. Michael Mellman, on Jan. 29 stating that
the initial dosage prescribed to control the player's irregular
heartbeat was reduced because he was not playing well.
   Hattori was at lunch when Fagel's news conference on the lawsuit
ended, said a spokeswoman for his office exchange. Mellman's
whereabouts were not immediately known.
   The letter stated that a dosage of 240 milligrams of Inderal a
day almost completely controlled Gathers' erratic heartbeat. But it
went on to say, ``His dose was diminished ... after a rather dismal
performance in his first game against Xavier. On a lower dose, he
apparently performed incredibly against St. John's. ...
   ``However, his performance was obviously still being unfavorably
affected by his medication so I decreased his Inderal.''
   The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of
Gathers' mother, Lucille; his brothers Derrick and Charles; and his
aunt, Carole Livingston.
   Hattori and Mellman are among the defendants, who also include
Loyola Athletic Director Bryann Quinn, team trainer Chip Schaefer
and a number of other doctors who treated Gathers.
   Another part of the letter quoted in the lawsuit said that
Hattori met with Gathers the week before his death and that the
player said he was satisfied with his level of performance with the
changes in medications.
   `` ... Later on over the weekend I got a call from his coach,
indicating that his athletic performance was still substantially
sub-par and that he felt strongly that the medication should be
changed.''
   Hattori said in the letter that Gathers felt decreasing his
dosage of Inderal would be preferable to changing medication, which
could make him miss a game while he adjusted.
   The last recorded dosage was 40 milligrams twice a day, far
below the 240 milligrams initially prescribed.
   Westhead has denied having any conversation in which he
instructed that Gathers' medication be reduced or changed.
   ``I don't have a clue about medications. Why would I tell a
doctor what is best for Hank Gathers?'' ESPN quoted Westhead on
Thursday as saying.

<HEAD>Unanimous Approval for Plan To Speed Up Drug War in the Americas</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mexico-Camarena</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IXTAPA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and 31 other member
nations of the Organization of American States on Friday formally
signed a wide-ranging plan to speed up the hemisphere's war against
drugs.
   The 20-point Declaration of Ixtapa, unanimously approved Friday
by the countries' top law enforcement officers, made no mention,
however, of extradition.
   Extradition of suspects _ especially to the United States _ has
been a touchy issue in Latin America in recent years, made even
touchier this month by the alleged abduction of a Mexican doctor to
stand trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 murder of a U.S. drug agent.
   The Declaration of Ixtapa calls for better education and
prevention, starting in grammar schools; greater coordination in
police actions; improvements in information exchange, and tougher
laws against the drug trade.
   It calls for stronger measures against money-laundering and
illegal sales of weapons and explosives and of lab equipment and
chemicals used in making drugs.
   The plan includes a project for economic aid through the Inter
American Development Bank and like financial institutions to help
farmers substitute legal crops for high-paying illicit crops such
as coca leaf, poppies and marijuana.
   The declaration called for greater cooperation by governments
``for adequate control of their borders,'' with ``absolute respect
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.''
   According to some news reports, bounty hunters snatched Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain, 42, from his gynecologist's office in
Guadalajara for a large reward put up by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Alvarez is one of 19 Mexicans indicted by a U.S. grand jury in
the torture-slaying of DEA agent Enrique Camarena.
   Mexico demanded an explanation and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh asked DEA director William C. Bennett for ``a full and
immediate'' investigation.
   Similarly, President Virgilio Barco of Colombia has been
criticized and threatened for extraditing Colombian drug suspects
to the United States.
   Experts from the OAS nations unanimously concluded in a report
to the assembled justice ministers at the four-day meeting that
nowhere is the drug problem more serious and pressing than in the
Americas.
   Latin America is a leading grower and producer of the three
principal drugs _ cocaine, heroin and marijuana _ and the United
States is the world's leading consumer and center for
money-laundering.
   Enormous profits derived from the drug trade ``are making it
possible for transnational criminal organizations to penetrate
government structures,'' the experts said.
   These criminal elements are ``penetrating legitimate business
activities, and society at all levels, corrupting and contaminating
them ... and undermining the foundations of states,'' the report
added.

<TEXT>
   The 3-year-old grandson of a former
Panamanian military leader has been found dead nine days after
being kidnapped for ransom, a police official said Friday.
   Marcos Rodriguez Justines was the grandson of ex-Col. Marcos
Justines, former military chief of staff in the Panamanian Defense
Forces.
   The boy's body had begun to decompose when it was found Thursday
afternoon, said Leslie Loaiza, director of the Judicial Police.
   The official said he did not know the motive for the killing,
nor would he say whether the $1 million ransom demanded by the
kidnappers had been paid.
   ``We will find out,'' Loaiza said.
   He would not provide details of the case except to say that the
kidnappers had been in contact with the family.
   The boy was kidnapped last week from his home in the Villa de
las Fuentes neighborhood of Panama City, the capital.
   Justines is in jail, as are many former military and government
officials after the U.S. invasion in December in which dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega was overthown.
   Noriega was replaced by civilian rival Guillermo Endara, who won
presidential elections in May 1989. Gen. Noriega, former Defense
Forces chief, had halted ballot-counting and voided results of that
election when it became apparent that Endara was winning.
   Noriega is in a Florida jail awaiting trial in the United States
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.

<HEAD>Government Failed To Make Fraud Case Against Ford, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford lived well, borrowed
heavily and gave political support to two Tennessee bankers, but
none of that means he broke the law, his lawyer said Friday at the
congressman's bank fraud trial.
   ``If you are to remove a political leader for his politics or
his lifestyle, that is to be done at the ballot box, not the jury
box,'' William McDaniels said in his closing argument to Ford's
trial jury.
   Ford, a Memphis Democrat, has been on trial since Feb. 12 on
conspiracy, bank and mail fraud charges. He is accused of taking
political payoffs from former bankers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr.
   The government says Ford got loans totaling more than $1 million
from the Butchers between 1976 and 1982 and he was not expected to
repay many of those debts.
   The Butchers' banking empire collapsed in 1983 and only then did
Ford begin trying to settle his loans, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Dan Clancy.
   ``He did not have the ability to repay all this stuff,'' Clancy
said in his closing statement Thursday.
   The government claims Ford took Butcher payoffs to finance a
lavish lifestyle. Prosecution witnesses said Ford bought a $35,000
car, $10,000 worth of oriental rugs and contracted for $94,000 in
home renovations while heavily in debt to the Butchers and other
bankers.
   Ford puts his Butcher loan total at $650,000 and says all of the
debts have been settled. He settled his obligations on one loan, a
$350,000 debt assigned to a company called Tenn-Ford Inc., by
paying $25,000 to a bankruptcy trustee.
   The congressman is on trial with three former Butcher aides,
accountant David Crabtree and lawyers Karl Schledwitz and Douglas
Beaty. They are accused of helping him get and hide Butcher payoffs.
   The case is expected to go to the jury early next week. Ford,
who has been in Congress since 1974, could face up to 95 years in
prison if convicted on all 19 counts of an indictment issued in
Knoxville three years ago.
   The defense rested its case without calling any witnesses. Ford
said he decided not to take the witness stand because he regarded
the government's case as weak.
   His lawyer said the government failed to show what Ford
supposedly did in exchange for Butcher payoffs.
   Prosecutors say Ford helped the Butchers in their business and
political ventures and was called upon to help find federal money
for a Memphis bridge to Butcher-owned property.

   Customs officials have seized a huge
cylinder that Iraq ordered from Britain for an artillery system,
Greece said Friday.
   The announcement came seven days after Britain seized a shipment
of steel tubes it said Iraq had ordered to make an enormous gun for
firing missiles.
   Customs officials in Greece's western port of Patras seized a
British truck Thursday that ``was conveying to Iraq a part of an
artillery system weighing 29.5 tons,'' the Finance Ministry said it
a statement.
   It said documents listed the cargo as a copper cylinder.
   Sotirios Sotiriou, Patras' chief customs official, said the
cargo contained a 17-foot-long cylinder with a base for connecting
it to a gun carriage.
   Sotiriou said that the driver of the truck, Paul Ashwell, 25, of
Northampton, England, had been arrested and would be charged with
illegally importing arms into Greece.
   Sotiriou said the British truck arrived in Greece by ship on
April 11 bound for Iraq. Officials held it up because of a missing
stamp on its documentation. The officer said customs officials
became suspicious because of reports about the shipment seized in
Britain and that it was intended for a huge Iraqi gun.
   Greek customs officials requested help from the British
government, Soritiou said.
   He said an unidentified British customs expert later examined
the cargo and determined it also was intended for the same big gun
Britain believes the Iraqis intended to build.
   Walter Somers Ltd. of Halesowen, near Birmingham, said they had
shipped the consignment but said two trucks were detained in Greece.
   Sotiriou confirmed Somers originated the cargo, but insisted
only one truck was seized.
   The domestic British news agency Press Association later quoted
David James, chairman of Somers' parent Eagle Trust, as saying
another truck had been detained Friday in Turkey.
   But Turkish officials, including the customs director in the
port Mersin, where the truck was rumored to be, denied the reports.
   Somers said the last of 12 steel tubes ordered by Iraq at a cost
of more than $1.6 million left the factory ``by shipment'' March 15.
   ``Until a few hours ago, we thought it had all gone by sea,'' a
company spokesman said. ``We now learn that two lorries (trucks)
detained in Greece were each carrying one and possibly two of our
pipes.
   ``It would be fair to assume that at least six of the others
forged by Walter Somers Ltd. have got through to Iraq.''
   Customs investigators were believed to have been trying to
intercept the road freight for more than a week as it made its way
from Birmingham to Iraq.
   British officials seized eight steel tubes on the Middlesbrough
docks in England on April 12. The tubes were parts for a gun that
would be 130 feet long with a bore of nearly 40 inches, British
customs officials said.
   The Iraqi government and the British manufacturer of the tubes,
Sheffield Forgemasters, have said they were designed for a
petrochemical plant. There was no immediate comment from Iraq on
the Greek shipment.
   Tony Peck, a spokesman for Sheffield Forgemasters, said in
London that he assumes the shipment confiscated in Greece ``is
ancillary equipment for the same Iraqi contract that has already
been widely reported.''
   Weapons experts have said a gun built from the parts confiscated
in Britain and Greece could fire nuclear or chemical missiles
hundreds of miles, far enough to reach Israel and Iran.
   Nicholas Ridley, Britain's trade and industry secretary, said on
Thursday his government ``is entirely satisfied that these tubes
form part of a gun and that the customs action was correct.''
   Britain banned arms shipments to Iran and Iraq when the two
countries were at war, and the ban remains in effect.

   Israel's Supreme Court on Friday blocked the
eviction of Jewish settlers living in a compound in the Christian
quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, temporarily setting aside an order
by the attorney general.
   The 150 settlers can remain in the four 100-year-old buildings
near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher until the high court hears
more arguments next week on an appeal for the settlers to remain.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish on Thursday ordered their
immediate eviction from the 72-room complex, owned by the Greek
Orthodox Church. Harish said he wanted to prevent further
deterioration of Jewish-Christian relations.
   The church claims a former tenant illegally sold his user rights
to the building to the settlers.
   The April 11 move by the settlers into the Christian quarter
sparked angry protests by Arab Christians and Moslems. They fear
the group is leading a campaign to eventually push all Palestinians
out of the walled Old City.
   After the high court allowed the settlers to stay, a half dozen
Greek Orthodox priests carrying candles staged a protest vigil
outside the complex. Black flags fluttered from the Holy Sepulcher
and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.
   Right-wing Parliament member Hanan Porath, a mentor of the
settler group, said even though the court treated the case as a
simple tenancy dispute, it was a political confrontation.
   ``The motives of all sides are political. This is a struggle
over the rights of Jews to live everywhere in Jerusalem,'' he told
The Associated Press.
   ``This is one of the most sensitive places in the world,''
Avraham Sochovolsky, attorney for the church, told the three-judge
panel. ``There is no quiet moment there now. We have to douse this
fire.''
   Anger over the move has been heightened by the fact that Arabs
cannot buy land in the Old City's Jewish Quarter under Israeli law.
   The settlement also has implications concerning Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem. The Christian quarter is part of east
Jerusalem, which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Most countries, including the United States, do not recognize
Israeli sovereignty over the disputed area. The Palestinians hope
east Jerusalem will be the capital of their would-be state.
   Greece on Friday strongly criticized Israel in the matter.
   ``We condemn the stand taken by Israel, which so far has failed
to take proper measures for removal of the occupiers,'' Foreign
Minister Antonis Samaras said in a statement. ``Moreover the
regrettable incident has taken place in occupied territory.''
   In Friday's hearing, the Supreme Court made no reference to the
religious and political dimensions of the case.
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar scheduled a hearing for next
Thursday, during which Harish must show why his immediate eviction
order should not be annulled.
   ``The settlers will be allowed to stay until there is a final
decision by the high court,'' said attorney Dan Avi-Yitzhak, who
represents the Panama-based company SBC, which leased the building
to the settlers.
   SBC claims it gave Martyros Matossian, an Armenian who has lived
in the complex more than 40 years, $3.5 million for the user
rights. Matossian left for Geneva before the settlers moved in.
   Attorney Yohanan Altbauer, who represents the church, said
Matossian had no right to sublet the building. He said the church
has been trying since 1982 to evict Matossian and that the case was
pending. A decision is not expected for another six months,
Altbauer said.
   The Supreme Court will not make a ruling on the tenancy dispute,
but only on whether the settlers can remain while the lower court
sorts out the tenancy rights.
   Altbauer said the Supreme Court judges offered a compromise
under which the settlers would leave and only a few SBC
representatives would remain until the tenancy dispute is decided.
   ``Both sides rejected the compromise,'' Altbauer said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration criticized Moscow's
escalating crackdown on Lithuania as ``another unfortunate step''
Friday and saidPresident Bush would summon leaders of Congress next
week to discuss possible retaliatory action.
   The situation in the break away Baltic republic darkened amid
reports that Moscow was blocking food shipments after sharply
reducing fuel supplies.
   Witnesses in the capital city of Vilnius also said Red Army
soldiers stormed into a printing plant and beat civilian guards.
   ``We are increasingly concerned by news reports today of an
economic crackdown on Lithuania,'' White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said, accompanying Bush on a political trip to
Birmingham and Orlando.
   Bush, himself, was silent on Lithuania. He avoided the subject
as he made a political appearance in Birmingham, Ala., and visited
a model recycling plant, and again in Orlando where he campaigned
for the GOP and also fed a bottle of food to a 235-pound orphan
manatee at Sea World.
   ``Although our information is sketchy, we are disturbed that
this signals another unfortunate step in the pressure being brought
to bear by the Soviet Union on Lithuania,'' Fitzwater said, reading
from prepared remarks.
   This statement represented a toughening of the administration's
rhetoric intended to match the increase in Soviet action and put
pressure on Moscow to relax tension.
   By delaying any U.S. response until next week, Bush in effect
gave Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a few more days to
reconsider his tactics to force Lithuania to drop its efforts to
succeed from the Soviet Union.
   Bush, during a tour of Orlando's Sea World park, was asked why
he was waiting until next week to respond to Soviet actions. ``A
lot of consultations going on,'' he replied.
   Hopeful of preserving U.S.-Soviet relations and prospects for
nuclear arms negotiations, Bush has reacted cautiously over the
last few weeks to Soviet intimidation of Lithuania.
   ``We continue to urge the Soviet Union to pursue a peaceful
course of dialogue in the hopes that this matter can be resolved in
a responsible manner,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Bush had stepped up consultation with allies about
actions the United States would take and steps that other nations
might adopt. Fitzwater said the president would complete his
deliberations next week.
   ``At that time President Bush would meet congressional leaders
to advise them on our consultations and to discuss possible courses
of action,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if Bush would announce after the meeting with
congressional leaders what he plans to do, Fitzwater said, ``I
would assume that we would be prepared to announce actions fairly
soon after that.''
   When asked why Bush needed more time to frame a response,
Fitzwater replied, ``Because many of the actions that we would
contemplate taking would involve other countries, would have
international implications, and we therefore think it's important
that we touch base with our allies on this issue.''
   The administration already has signaled that the most likely
U.S. action against Moscow would be in the economic field, such as
trade, rather than a slowdown in arms negotiations or discussions
of regional disputes.
   Earlier Friday, Fitzwater indicated the administration held out
hope for release of an American hostage in Lebanon but cited
``troublesome patterns we've seen before.''
   With the hostage situation still uncertain _ and Kremlin tactics
turning to violence in Lithuania _ Bush followed a
business-as-usual approach, blending politics with environmentalism
and a touch of personal recreation.
   After an early-morning jog and a speedboat ride in Key Largo,
Fla., Bush jetted to Birmingham to help raise money for Bill
Cabaniss, a conservative businessman struggling to unseat incumbent
Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin.
   The next stop was back in Florida for an Orlando fund-raiser to
boost Gov. Bob Martinez' re-election hopes and to help other
Republicans. After that, Bush was flying back to the Florida Keys
for a weekend of fishing.
   In his public remarks, Bush stayed away from the Mideast and
Lithuania situations, instead celebrating the defections of 215
Democratic politicians, mostly in the South, to Republican ranks
since the 1988 election.
   Overshadowing the trip were the promise of release _ and then
threatened delay _ of an American hostage in Lebanon. Those
concerns were compounded by new Soviet coercion in Lithuania.
   Fitzwater said that Syria, which exerts military control in
Lebanon, ``still believes there's a possibility of release'' of a
hostage even though the kidnappers said they were postponing it.
   The captors, the radical Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, blamed the delay on Bush's refusal to meet their demand
to send Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly to Syria to accept
a hostage.
   ``That was just a smokescreen and we think people realize
that,'' Fitzwater said. In a countermove, Bush sent the U.S.
ambassador to Syria, Edward Djerejian, back to Damascus to be on
hand for hostage developments.
   While holding out hope for release of a hostage, Fitzwater said,
``We'll just wait and see if it's real.''
   Asked if the kidnappers were toying with the United States,
Fitzwater replied, ``They do it every time.''
   To highlight the environment, Bush went to Birmingham-Southern
College to view a model recycling program that enlists the help of
inner city youngsters as well as college students.
   In Orlando, Bush announced the addition of five new sites,
including waterways around Boston's polluted harbor, to the
Environmental Protection Agency's National Estuary Program.
   The designation leads to the development of comprehensive
management plans to protect the areas.
   The new sites are: Tampa Bay and the Indian River Complex, both
in Florida; the Barataria-Terrebonne Estuarine Complex in
Louisiana; Casco Bay, Maine, and the Massachusetts Bays in
Massachusetts.
   Bush also used his Orlando appearance to unleash tough criticism
against Democrats.
   ``Sadly, the other party has no firm principles, and no new
ideas to offer the world at this critical time,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>President Calls For Remembrance of Armenians Killed By Turks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush paid respects Friday to the
more than 1 million Armenians killed in ``terrible massacres'' at
the hands of the Turks from 1915 to 1923.
   Bush, in a written statement issued during a visit here, said he
joined with Armenians and others who will observe April 24 as a day
of remembrance.
   ``I call upon all peoples to work to prevent future acts of
inhumanity against mankind, and my comments of June 1988 represent
the depth of my feeling for the Armenian people and the sufferings
they have endured,'' Bush said.
   In 1988, as a candidate for president, Bush referred to the
killings as a ``genocide.''
   As president, he has refrained from using that term out of
sensitivity toward Turkey, a NATO ally. The Bush administration
opposed a Senate resolution sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., which called the killings genocide.
   Bush said that through their history, the Armenians have shown
strength and resilience in the face of numerous tragedies.
   ``Those tragedies include the earthquake of 1988 and, most
prominently, the terrible massacres suffered in 1915-1923 at the
hands of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire,'' the president said.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of this old milltown
reached back to 1915 to find a way to keep teen-agers off the
streets after 10 p.m.
   Mayor Patrick Hildreth said he dusted off a 75-year-old law
imposing a 10 p.m. curfew in an effort to curb vandalism and
excessive noise on the streets of the town of 5,300, 20 miles north
of Albany.
   ``It also brings parents and children closer together,'' he said
Friday. ``In this day and age, when both parents are working,
that's important.''
   Parents of first-time violators will get off with a warning,
Hildreth said. If their kids are caught a second time, parents face
a $25 fine. After that, parents could find themselves behind bars.
   The youths who violate the curfew face no penalty. The
ordinance, which police began enforcing Monday, applies to anyone
under the age of 16.
   Each night, even on weekends, a horn that sits atop a telephone
pole next to the local McDonald's sounds the start of the curfew.
   ``Nobody has been arrested yet,'' said Hildreth, who's found
some opposition in his own back yard from his son Kevin, 13.
   ``My son doesn't like it, but he was never allowed out after 10
anyway,'' Hildreth said. ``It's been on the books since 1915. I had
to comply with the law when I was a kid, and the curfew then was
9:30.''
   Hildreth said he hasn't received any complaints yet from
parents, but the New York Civil Liberties Union is looking into the
matter and may challenge the ordinance.
   ``Forget it, the law could never stand up in court,'' said the
group's executive director, Norman Siegel. ``It's
unconstitutional.''

<TEXT>
   A mother who pleaded guilty in the killing
of her 2-year-old son during potty training was sentenced Friday to
an agreed-upon 30 years in prison.
   Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, dressed in her navy blue jail uniform,
stared blankly as she listened to the sentence, part of a deal made
last month in which she agreed to plead guilty to second-degree
murder in the July 27 death of Bradley McGee.
   Mrs. Coe's husband, Thomas Coe, told authorities he repeatedly
dunked Bradley head-first into a toilet for soiling his pants, and
then he and his wife beat the child with pillows until he collapsed.
   While Mrs. Coe's 30-year sentence exceeds the recommended 12 to
17 years for second-degree murder, a first-degree murder conviction
would have brought a sentence of life in prison without parole for
at least 25 years.
   Under the plea deal, Circuit Judge Randall McDonald imposed the
30-year sentence, which with good behavior and gain time translates
to about 10 years in actual time behind bars.
   ``I don't think it was harsh enough,'' said Kip Lyles, who once
cared for Bradley in a foster home. ``I think she should have
received the death penalty for what she did. ... She did nothing to
protect the child and she participated in it.''
   Prosecutors say Mrs. Coe will be subpoenaed to testify against
her husband at his first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse
trial, set for July in Fort Myers.
   Bradley McGee had been in foster care since his parents
abandoned him at a Lakeland mall when he was 3 months old. The
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services returned the
child to his parents despite repeated warnings from foster parents
and relatives that he might be in danger.
   Bradley died two months after being returned.
   Three HRS child protection workers were later charged with
failing to report suspected child abuse. One HRS supervisor was
acquitted in February and the others still face trial.
   Outrage over the toddler's death also prompted lawmakers last
fall to pass the ``Bradley McGee Bill,'' allocating an extra $78
million for the HRS to hire more child-protection workers.

   The bodies of 51 burros have been found in
the Black Mountain foothills, and authorities are looking for those
responsible for killing the wild animals, a Bureau of Land
Management official said Friday.
   BLM crews in a helicopter spotted 11 more carcasses Friday,
bringing the week's total to 51, said Bureau of Land Management
wrangler Kelly Grissom.
   The carcasses all were found in the same area of the foothills,
about 15 miles southwest of this western Arizona town, where 38
others were found earlier this week.
   Grissom said an investigation was under way, adding that bullets
removed from the carcasses indicate more than one weapon was used.
   Some of slaughtered burros likely would have been rounded up for
the BLM's ``adopt-a-burro'' program begun in 1976, under which some
of the animals are given away, said Elaine Marquis, area managner
for the BLM.
   The BLM maintains about 2,100 wild burros on public lands
throughout western and central Arizona.
   The local Humane Society and other animal protection groups have
begun offering rewards for information about the burros' deaths.

   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas said
Friday his country was donating $25,000 to build a recreation
center in the neighborhood where 87 people died when fire swept
through an illegal social club.
   Cardinal John O'Connor said the archdiocese of New York also was
committed to building the center to diminish the need for illegal
social clubs in the Bronx neighborhood.
   The announcements were made at a memorial Mass for the victims
of the Happy Land Social Club tragedy.
   Callejas told the more than 750 people inside St. Thomas Aquinas
Church and more than 100 people listening through loudspeakers
outside that the Honduran people raised the money, and that $1,000
of it was from his own pocket.
   O'Connor said the church would match the contribution if the
city would donate the land. He promised to donate $999.99 of his
own.
   Most of the 87 people who died March 25 when fire ravaged the
club were Honduran immigrants.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, a Cuban immigrant, has been charged with
setting the blaze.
   The Mass, originally scheduled for Sunday at St. Patrick's
Cathedral, was shifted to St. Thomas, two blocks from the gutted
social club building, so Callejas could attend, officials said.
   ``Too many immigrants in our country are forced to live in
crowded, inadequate and dangerous housing conditions,'' O'Connor,
speaking in Spanish, told families and friends of the victims.
   These immigrants have menial jobs because they are illegal, and
``it comes as no surprise that they are forced to use crowded and
dangerous facilities for various forms of social activities because
they are so poor,'' O'Connor said.
   Callejas told the crowd that ``we are together in your pain.''

   Moscow on Friday expanded its energy
embargo on Lithuania to include certain shipments of food, metal
and industrial parts in its continuing effort to crush the
republic's independence drive, Lithuanians said.
   Dozens of Soviet soldiers also stormed a printing plant and beat
civilian guards and a local legislator Friday, witnesses said.
   The Kremlin ``is seeking to stop the plants, put the workers on
the streets, and encourage social unrest,'' Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis charged at a news conference Friday night.
   Thus far in the 5-week-old standoff, no such unrest has occurred.
   Despite military and economic pressure, Lithuanians have refused
to back off their March 11 declaration of independence from the
Soviet Union, as demanded by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
and have solicited Western material and political support.
   ``I'll have to sacrifice,'' said Aviea Kishnevskaya, a Jewish
mother in her 30s interviewed in Vilnius, the capital. She said
that requiring her 7-year-old daughter to share those sacrifices
will be the hardest part. The city was calm Friday, and traffic was
quieter than usual.
   Vilnius radio said the Presidium of the Lithuanian parliament
messaged Gorbachev reiterating Lithuania's readiness to negotiate
with Moscow.
   It said Landbergis disclosed details Friday night and quoted the
message as reading in part, ``All countries big and small ... can
and must find a solution worthy of civilized societies to any
complication if these countries are guided by the principles of
humanity. And it is only political dialogue that must underlie the
search for the wisest solution.''
   The message also said, ``We have no doubt that brutal assault
and battery of ordinary people, like the one ... launched by units
of the Soviet armed forces in Vilnius today, will call forth your
condemnation and that those guilty ... will be punished
accordingly.''
   Landsbergis was quoted as saying that a freeze on putting
Lithuania's independence fully into effect could form part of a
compromise.
   ``If somebody authorized by Moscow to negotiate presented us
with a package of proposals including this, we could have a
discussion,'' The New York Times' Saturday editions quoted him as
saying in a telephone interview.
   In Birmingham, Ala., where President Bush spoke at a political
rally, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House is
``increasingly concerned'' by reports of the Soviet economic
crackdown on Lithuania and that Bush will be ready to brief
Congress early next week on possible retaliation.
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Two ships from Cuba carrying raw sugar were diverted from the
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and a shipment of fish due from Latvia
was sent elsewhere, Lithuania Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas
Ozolas told reporters Friday night.
   Lithuania produces more meat and milk than it consumes, and is
in no danger of starving.
   But Lithuania's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, said
Friday this Baltic republic of 3.8 million people must compromise
on its pro-independence decisions or face critical shortages of oil
and natural gas in two weeks, following Soviet cut-offs and
reductions the previous two days.
   Brazauskas said Moscow also has cut off the supply of rubber
tires, polyesterol, cables, bearings and caustic soda. Large
scheduled shipments of metal and wood failed to appear, he said.
   Most factories here are expected to close if no solution emerges.
   ``In two weeks we will have a critical situation,'' Brazauskas
told the Lithuanian parliament. ``The price for independence must
have limits.''
   Algimantas Cekuolis, a newspaper editor and former Lithuanian
representative in the Soviet parliament, told reporters Lithuanians
may offer to freeze their new laws backing up independence, ``if
Moscow gives us guarantees of something.''
   Gorbachev has refused to negotiate unless Lithuania rescinds its
declaration of independence.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was in Norway on Friday
learning about buying oil for hard currency at world-market prices
instead of low-cost oil for Soviet rubles. She offered to trade
Lithuanian dairy products and said she will seek financial aid from
the West.
   Despite all this, Foreign Minister Lennart Meri of neighboring
Estonia said in Finland on Friday his republic rejects Soviet
threats and inducements and refuses to rescind a March 30
declaration proclaiming itself an occupied, independent state.
   Armed soldiers stormed a Communist Party printing plant in
Vilnius Friday afternoon, beating at least 12 civilian guards and a
local legislator, witnesses said.
   Soviet soldiers previously occupied more than a half-dozen party
and public buildings, but without violence.
   Lithuanian legislator Zigmas Vaisvilas told reporters the
civilian guards arrived Friday at the plant, which already was
occupied by a few Interior Ministry troops without weapons.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the colonel in charge asked the
27 civilians to leave and called in reinforcements when they did
not.
   Helmeted Soviet soldiers carrying automatic weapons and
truncheons arrived in two trucks, surged into the building and beat
some of the civilians, said witness Angele Guobiene, who works for
the trade union journal Darbas Ir Poilsis that is printed at the
plant.
   Newspaper editor Algimantas Cekuolis said the civilians,
including legislator Vaisvilas, were hurt when they tried to bar
the soldiers. Two or three people were hospitalized, Cekuolis said.
   Tass said the civilians were hurt when soldiers shoved them
bodily out the door.
   Police kept reporters out of the building. Soldiers were visible
in the building's courtyard. Some workers barricaded themselves
near printing presses and looked out of open windows.
   About 500 people gathered outside. They sang nationalist songs
and carried the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union merged with
the Nazi swastika.
   Soldiers began occupying buildings in Vilnius a month ago, among
them a plant that prints the republic's newspapers. The plant
occupied Friday prints non-political magazines.
   Lithuania on Friday limited gasoline to just under eight gallons
a month for private cars and some large factories planned to give
workers a day off Saturday _ the only conservation steps reported
to deal with the cut-off of oil and loss of 80 percent of its
supply of natural gas.
   The energy embargo left Lithuania with only 15 percent to 17
percent of the 18 million cubic meters of natural gas it uses daily
for homes and industry.
   Gorbachev has demanded repeal of new republic laws that halt
conscription of Lithuanians into the Soviet army and introduce
identity cards for all citizens. He also complained about alleged
seizure of Communist Party property.
   Brazauskas said the March 11 declaration should not be
reconsidered, but urged lawmakers to compromise on Gorbachev's
other demands ``to take us out of this dead end.''

   The body of a Michigan woman who was
one of 161 people killed after arsonists torched a Scandinavian
ferry was returned home on Thursday.
   The body of Ruth Rome, 27, arrived at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport about 5 p.m., said her mother, Winifred Rome.
   The young woman had moved from East Lansing to New York before
taking a singing job on the Scandinavian Star. She had been
employed about a week when the ferry burned April 7. The fire
remains under investigation.
   Services for Ms. Rome were scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Sunday at
Congregation Shaarey Zedek in East Lansing, her mother said.
   Mrs. Rome said endowments in her daughter's name are being
established at Okemos High School, from which she graduated in
1980, and at Shaarey Zedek. ``I think it will be for music-related
activity,'' she said.

   A single-engine Cessna stalled and plunged

Thursday, killing all four people aboard, Coast Guard officials
said.
   The crash occurred about 5 p.m. on the north end of Upper

off from Pine Island Airport near Fort Myers.
   ``Unfortunately, we couldn't rescue them,'' Diaz said after

   Fire gutted the home of a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission inspector Thursday, just hours after he
received several threatening telephone calls, authorities said.
   Nobody was hurt in the fire, which occurred about 11 a.m. at the
suburban home of Kenneth Jenison, senior resident NRC inspector at
Sequoyah Nuclear Plant.
   Jenison was at Sequoyah when he learned of the blaze; he later
found that the lugs on the wheels of his car had been loosened,
said NRC spokesman Ken Clark.
   Hamilton County arson officials were investigating the cause of
the fire, which erupted after Jenison received phone threats
Wednesday night and earlier Thursday morning, Clark said from his
Atlanta office.
   ``We are asking the FBI to look into the matter,'' Clark said.
``We will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our resident
inspectors, their families and their property.''
   Details of the threats were not disclosed.
   Oliver Kingsley, head of the Tennessee Valley Authority's
nuclear program, said TVA officials were ``shocked and outraged by
the apparently deliberately burning'' of Jenison's home.
   ``TVA is cooperating fully with the investigation into this
matter and immediately began an internal examination to see if
anything in TVA could be tied to this incident,'' said Kingsley.
   Jenison, one of three NRC inspectors at Sequoyah, has been at
the TVA plant for about five years, Clark said.

   More than 30,000 people in the
Australian outback have been isolated by near-record floods, police
said Friday.
   Farming districts in central and southern Queensland state were
hardest hit by rising flood waters that followed three weeks of
heavy rain. Meterologists said the flooding was the worst in the
area for 40 years.
   Most of the normally dusty roads in the region were awash,
forcing animals to high ground and many families from their homes.
   Families were evacuated from two towns, and another city had
been cut off from overland travel for nearly a month. Among those
isolated were 80 campers near Carnarvon Gorge but they were in no
danger, a police spokesman said.
   Two Royal Australian Air Force Caribou transport planes dropped
supplies to small rural communities Thursday and planned similar
flights over the weekend.

<HEAD>Police Frustrate Terrorist Attack on Medellin Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Thursday foiled a plan by two
Spanish Basque mercenaries to attack the Medellin airport with
rocket and rifle fire, authorities said.
   Officials have accused members of the ETA, the separatist Basque
group in Spain, of carrying out terrorist attacks in Colombia for
drug traffickers.
   Gen. Huberto Camero, the city's police chief, said police found
a rocket and two automatic rifles in a raid on a house across from
Medellin airport. He said in a communique the two terrorists fled
moments before the raid.
   Camero said the two were planning to carry out ``a large-scale
attack, presumably against either presidential candidates or
aircraft.''
   The candidate for the opposition Conservative Party, Rodrigo
Lloreda, was in Medellin on Thursday campaigning for May 27
elections.
   In Bogota, Gen. Miguel Maza, chief of Colombia's security
police, told reporters the two mercenaries arrived in Medellin on
Wednesday, apparently to prepare the attack on the airport.
   Mercenaries from the ETA _ which stands for Basque Land and
Liberty in the Basque language _ have been implicated in two of the
worst terrorist attacks by drug traffickers in their war against
the government.
   Police blame the terrorists for bombing a Colombian jetliner
last Nov. 27, killing all 107 people aboard. A car bomb targeting
security police headquarters killed 63 people and wounded about
1,000 on Dec. 6.
   ETA members fabricated the car bomb, police said.
   Terrorists working for the Medellin cocaine cartel exploded a
car bomb on a busy Medellin highway last week, killing 20 people,
including eight police.
   The attacks were in retaliation for a government antidrug
campaign, now in its eighth month.
   In Bogota, the capital, the government told Colombia's biggest
leftist guerrilla group Thursday to end hostilities if it wants a
peace agreement similar to that of other rebels who disbanded.
   Hours later, six leftist guerrillas were killed in a battle with
a special army brigade created to fight the rebels. The deaths
brought to 28 the number of rebels killed by the brigade in its
first two weeks in operation.
   President Virgilio Barco's emissary for guerrilla contacts,
Rafael Pardo, sent a message demanding that the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces, known as the FARC, cease attacks if it
wants to begin peace talks.
   The statement was revealed in an official communique.
   The FARC says it has about 10,000 combatants. The Defense
Department puts the number at about 4,400.
   By either measure, the FARC is the largest of Colombia's four
guerrilla groups. It was founded in the 1950s.
   The FARC has expressed interest in peace talks, but has
continued its attacks and kidnappings, Pardo said.
   The government successfully negotiated an end to hostilities by
another guerrilla group, the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, last
January and the M-19 leader, Carlos Pizarro, is running in the May
26 presidential elections.
   Another guerrilla group, the People's Liberation Army, or EPL,
said this month that it, too, is interested in peace talks.
   The six guerrillas killed Thursday belonged to EPL, a Maoist
group, an army communique said. Rebels fought soldiers in
Montelibano, 250 miles north of Bogota.
   Colombia's most active guerrilla group, the National Liberation
Army, known as the ELN, says it will fight until it overthrows the
government.

<HEAD>Ford Loans Hidden in Hocus-Pocus, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of dollars in payoffs to U.S.
Rep. Harold Ford were covered up with ``hocus-pocus'' and bogus
loans from two crooked bankers, a prosecutor said Thursday in
closing arguments in Ford's fraud trial.
   For more than 10 years, loans Ford wasn't expected to repay were
bounced from bank to bank, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Clancy told
the U.S. District Court jury.
   Several loans in the Memphis Democrat's name ended up in his
father's name or as the responsibility of a vague company called
Tenn-Ford Inc., Clancy said.
   ``Hocus-pocus, now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don't, and his name is
taken off,'' Clancy said.
   Ford, 44, is accused of taking payoffs from former Tennessee
bankers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr. He is charged with 19 counts of
conspiracy, bank and mail fraud, and faces up to 95 years in prison
if convicted of all charges.
   Also on trial are three former Butcher aides: accountant David
Crabtree and attorneys Douglas Beaty and Karl Schledwitz.
   C.H. Butcher was indicted with Ford in 1987, but has pleaded
guilty to bank fraud and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. His
brother Jake, who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, is
serving a 20-year sentence in another bank fraud case.
   Ford started getting loans between $6,000 and $7,000 from the
Butchers in 1976, two years after he was first elected to Congress,
but his political value to the bankers grew over the years,
according to the government. In 1982, he got $350,000 from C.H.
Butcher through Tenn-Ford, which was created by the bankers' aides.
   ``As his influence increased, so did his ability to talk them
into giving him more money,'' Clancy said.
   The Butchers once controlled the largest string of banks in
Tennessee, but their financial empire collapsed in 1983 under the
weight of mismanagement and fraud.
   After C.H. Butcher's Southern Industrial Banking Corp.
collapsed, Ford settled his obligations under the Tenn-Ford
arrangement by paying a bankruptcy trustee $25,000.
   He told the trustee in a sworn statement that Tenn-Ford was set
up to handle an investment by C.H. Butcher in the N.J. Ford &amp; Son's
Funeral Parlor in Memphis.
   Clancy said records of Ford's personal accountant showed that
much of the Tenn-Ford money went to pay the congressman's personal
debts, including credit card and department store bills.
   ``The funeral home didn't have an account at Neiman-Marcus. The
funeral home didn't have an account at Saks Fifth Avenue,'' Clancy
said.
   Ford says the government has failed to show what he supposedly
did for the alleged payoffs, but Clancy said the motive for the
Butchers giving him money is clear.
   ``Since you know who got the money, you know what they got for
it. There was only one thing to get. ... They needed a United
States congressman,'' he said.
   Financial records offered as evidence showed that Ford had so
many debts in 1982 that his expenses exceeded his income by $12 a
month even though he was not paying anything on his Butcher loans,
Clancy said.
   Ford has acknowledged he was in bad financial shape and that he
turned to C.H. Butcher to help line up investors in the Ford family
business.
   Ford, the only black member of Tennessee's congressional
delegation, has said since his indictment that he is the victim of
racist prosecutors who dislike him personally. Clancy has denied
those allegations.
   The defense was to present its closing argument Friday, and the
case may go to the jury.

<HEAD>Judge Finds Man Innocent Because of Flub</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man on trial for resisting arrest was freed
Thursday after a judge agreed that he wasn't actually charged with
anything because the wrong name was listed on the official papers.
   Anthony Martinez's lawyer, Peter Collins, waited for prosecutors
to rest their case before telling Dade County Judge Morton Perry
about the error.
   Over the protests of the state attorney's office, Perry on
Wednesday found Martinez innocent.
   ``We don't feel a case should be decided on a typographical
error,'' complained Chief Assistant State Attorney John Hogan.
   Prosecutors said they would try to file new charges against
Martinez, a jail guard from Miami.
   But Collins said there were no grounds for such action, because
the case ended in an acquittal, not the dismissal of charges.
   ``They can't appeal a not-guilty verdict,'' said Collins. ``The
case is history.''
   Martinez was arrested after allegedly threatening his girlfriend
with a gun. But the paperwork in the case mistakenly listed two
different names as the accused _ neither of which was Anthony
Martinez.
   The two assistant prosecutors on the case, Lisa Kreeger and
Tammera J. Ferrari, failed to notice the mistake.
   When Collins pointed it out, the judge gave the prosecutors 10
days to come up with a reason why he shouldn't throw out the case.
   The prosecutors tried to argue that since Martinez was not
named, the trial never happened. But the judge rejected that
reasoning.

<HEAD>Soldier Killed, 15 Houses Burned in Haitian Clash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers fired Thursday into a
crowd of protesters throwing stones and the mob retaliated by
beating a soldier to death and burning his body, radio reports said.
   Two people suffered gunshot wounds and 15 houses were burned in
the protest over the quality of utility services in Cabaret, a
village about 20 miles north of Port-au-Prince, the reports said.
   Privately owned Radio Haiti Inter said clashes began after
villagers blocked a highway. Soldiers used billy clubs to scatter
the crowd, protesters threw stones and soldiers fired, wounding two
people, the radio said.
   It said the mob turned on one soldier who fired and killed him.
   The report said troop reinforcements burned 15 houses in
retaliation. But the local military commander, Lt. Atin Voltaire,
denied soldiers were involved in the burning, according to Radio
Metropole, another independent station.
   The violence came as doubts grew over the army's pledge to let
the new civilian government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
lead this impoverished Caribbean nation to democratic elections.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot became president on March 13 after a
popular uprising forced military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to
flee into exile. She promised to hold democratic elections as soon
as posssible.
   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a popular priest, on Thursday
accused the government of lacking the political will to control the
8,300-member army, and expressed doubt over the possibility of free
elections.
   ``If the army isn't under control, what sort of elections can we
expect?'' he told a news conference.

   The company of Gerald V. Bull, the U.S.
rocket scientist who was mysteriously slain at his Brussels
apartment last month, will be going out of business, his family
said Thursday.
   It denied the firm, Space Research Corp., was linked to shipping
steel tubes from Britain to Iraq that British officials say can be
made into the barrel of a giant gun.
   ``The Bull family has decided to cease all SRC operations and
dissolve companies within the SRC Group,'' the company said in a
brief statement. ``The Bull family contests to be or to have been
involved in any illegal acts or arms traffic of any nature.''
   Bull, 62, a Canadian-born American, was an aerospace scientist
and reputed to be an artillery expert. He was slain March 22. His
killer remains at large.
   British customs officials seized eight steel tube sections on
April 12 as they were about to be shipped to Iraq. The manufacturer
has denied the tubes can be used as a gun barrel.
   Police have ruled out robbery as a motive in Bull's slaying.
They said they found $20,000 in the victim's pockets.
   Bull built a 6,000-acre compound for his Space Research Corp. in
North Troy, Vt., on the Canadian border in the late 1970s.
   He moved SRC to Brussels in 1980 after serving a six-month term
for selling howitzer technology to South Africa in violation of a
U.S. law and a United Nations arms embargo.

   Chadian soldiers killed 517 Libyan-backed
rebels and took 208 prisoners in heavy fighting along Chad's
eastern border with Sudan, the government announced Thursday.
   A communique said government forces ``completely destroyed'' a
column of the so-called Islamic Legion in the combat Wednesday, but
gave no specific location and said nothing of government losses.
   It said troops also captured 40 light pickup trucks, two
multiple-rocket launchers, seven single-rocket launchers, 31
artillery pieces, three heavy trucks and numerous small arms, and
destroyed a like amount of material.
   The Islamic Legion infiltrates into Chad from Sudan's Darfur
province, an area over which the Sudanese government exercises
virtually no control.
   The communique stressed the soldiers' ``ferocious
determination'' to crush the rebels. Chad claims the Legion is
armed by Libya. Tripoli denies the group exists.
   Fighting in the sporadic civil war broke out last month when
rebels took government outposts at Bahai and Tine. Chadian troops
retook the positions in fighting which N'Djamena said killed 330
guerrillas.
   The battles prompted France to reinforce its garrisons in
eastern Chad with 146 paratroopers, a second transport aircraft and
a military surgical unit. France had been stationing about 1,000
troops in its former African colony.
   Libya once occupied most of northern Chad, but was chased out
three years ago. Tripoli still claims a strip of land on Chad's
northern border, the Aouzou Strip.

<HEAD>Study Concludes Small Cut In Illegal Immigration Since 1986 Reform
Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The number of illegal aliens caught
entering the country per year dropped nearly by half from 1986 to
1988, but sanctions on employers played a small role in cutting the
flow, said a study released Thursday.
   Employer sanctions in the Immigration Reform and Control Act
alone slowed the rate of illegal entry into the United States by
less than 20 percent, according to a joint study by the Rand Corp.
and the Washington-based Urban Institute.
   The study concluded that if the sanctions portion of the law was
expected to merely stop the increase of illegal immigrants, the
reform act has succeeded.
   But if officials expected a major drop in such numbers, then the
sanctions have failed and they probably should be reviewed by
Congress, the study's authors said.
   Among the considerations would be increasing the level of
enforcement or considering the cost of continuing the sanctions
against such limited results.
   Congress approved the Immigration Act in November 1986. The
employer-sanctions section was one of the most controversial.
   For more than a year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
conducted seminars and contacted businesses about their obligations
under the law. Then businesses were checked for compliance.
   Only in 1989 were repeat offenders prosecuted and punished for
disobeying the law.
   The study looked at various statistics to make its conclusions,
including counts of people passing through Canyon Zapata north of
Tijuana, Mexico, a favored spot of illegal entry of the United
States.
   The raw data showed more than 1.7 million apprehensions in 1986,
down to just over 1 million apprehensions in 1988, the last year
for which the statistics were available.
   Immigration waiting lists of several countries also were
investigated. Researchers theorized that if immigration reforms
were effective, more people would be convinced to try entering the
United States legally.
   Also reviewed were the wages for jobs traditionally taken by
illegal immigrants: dishwashing and car washing. A rise in wages
would indicate a decrease in the supply of such workers, but no
rise was detected.
   ``Alone, none of our data sets provides conclusive evidence that
employer sanctions have or have not reduced undocumented
immigration,'' the study said. ``Together, the preponderance of the
evidence points to some decline in the flow.''

<HEAD>First Half of April Set Record For Political Violence in Peru^</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 300 people were killed in political
violence in the first half of April, the bloodiest 15-day period in
Peru's decade-long guerrilla war, according to a Senate commission.
   Sen. Enrique Bernales of the Socialist Left coalition said
Thursday the guerrillas launched 178 attacks against government and
civilian targets in the same period, also a record.
   Much of the violence occurred before the April 8 general
elections. Rebels tried to sabotage the elections by assassinating
candidates and threatening to kill people who voted.
   Peru's elected government is currently battling two violent
leftist insurgencies.
   The most radical group is the Mao-inspired Shining Path, which
began fighting 10 years ago in the southern Andean highlands. It
now operates throughout the Andes and in the coca-producing jungles
of the northeast.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement is a smaller and less
violent group that operates mainly in Lima and some regions of the
northern jungle. The pro-Cuban group took up arms in 1984.
   Bernales, head of a respected Senate commission on violence,
said 150 of the April deaths were confirmed by the military or
police. The rest were unofficial reports received by his office.
   More than 18,000 people have been killed since 1980. He said a
great majority of the dead were civilians killed by both sides.
   Bernales criticized President Alan Garcia's government for
telling the public it is winning the war against the guerrillas.
   ``This is dramatic evidence that terrorism has not been slowed
but has increased,'' Bernales said.
   The highest monthly death toll was recorded by the commission
last June when 470 people were killed.

   President Bush is expected to name a female

prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro,
according to informed sources.
   The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the
appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to
Mozambique.
   They said the administration believed a female ambassador could
relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office
Wednesday.
   They also said the administration is eager to have more women in
key posts. Only rarely have U.S. ambassadorships in Latin America
gone to women.

   Despite a pact to disband the Contras,
President Daniel Ortega said Nicaraguans can't be sure their
9-year-old civil war is over until the last rebel lays down his gun.
   The Contras signed an accord Thursday with the United National
Opposition and the Sandinistas to begin turning in their weapons
next Wednesday, the day the 14-party bloc and President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro are to take office.
   The Contras are to give up all of their arms by June 10, and all
sides agreed to a cease-fire that went into effect at noon Thursday.
   There has been widespread speculation the Sandinista government
might not transfer power as pledged _ despite its loss in Feb. 25
elections _ if the Contras did not disarm. The situation has
created an atmosphere of mutual suspicion, and Ortega appealed for
trust.
   ``We still can't say that peace has arrived, but we can say
today that we are much closer to peace and are distancing ourselves
from war,'' he said after a meeting with Bernard Aronson, the U.S.
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.

   ``They want to be able to reach every single kid who watches
television, and we know from experience with kids that the way to
grab their attention is to use characters they know to convey a
story and a message,'' said Phyllis Tucker Vinson, NBC vice
president for children's programming.

   An international task force is recommending a
worldwide plan to uncover billions of dollars being hidden by
narcotics dealers through intricate money-laundering transactions.
   A major element of the plan, according to Deputy Treasury
Secretary John E. Robson, is a requirement that financial
institutions report questionable dealings by their customers.
   ``Specifically, the task force recommends that, as in the United
States, financial institutions must be able to report suspicious
transactions to law enforcement, in good faith, free from fear of
liability under secrecy laws,'' Robson said at a news conference
Thursday.
   ``Suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be very
valuable to U.S. law enforcement,'' he added.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Women till the poor land, toil in
sweatshops and perform the other drudgery that moves Haiti's meager
economy, but the choice of a woman as president in March was their
first real taste of power.
   ``They dominate in agriculture, trade and industry,''
sociologist Daniele Bazin said. ``They, in fact, run this country.''
   Until Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, 46, was installed March 26, women
were virtually excluded from power in Haiti, which has been ruled
by dictators through much of its 186 years.
   As recently as the early 1980s, women were regarded as ``legal
minors,'' barred from opening bank accounts, buying property or
traveling without the consent of their husbands.
   Those laws have been repealed, but little has been done to
improve the hard lot of most Haitian women.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman ever to serve on the
Supreme Court, has become a symbol of women's aspirations since
taking office as provisional president.
   ``I accept in the name of Haitian women,'' she said at the
inauguration.
   Her civilian administration, which is to govern as caretaker
until democratic elections can be held, replaced the 18-month-old
military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who was driven into
exile by a popular uprising.
   The choice of Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot by a coalition of opposition
groups ``had psychological impact,'' historian Suzy Castor said.
   ``When the army gives up power to a civilian, and to a woman at
that, it has a lot of meaning,'' she said. ``I don't have
illusions, but it represents a few steps.''
   Symbol she may be, but the elegant, highly educated president
has little in common with her illiterate, improverished sisters.
   Women from privileged families have gained ground in Haiti _
about half the doctors are women, for instance _ but only
one-fourth of university students are women. What money is
available for higher education usually goes to a son.
   Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic, is the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.
   Most of its 6 million people live in the countryside, working
tiny mountain plots of coffee, sugar cane, rice and corn with
primitive tools. Agriculture accounts for 32 percent of a gross
national product valued at $1.5 billion annually.
   Half the work force is unemployed and average annual pay for
those who find jobs is only about $370. Most city dwellers live in
slums without electricity, potable water or adequate sewers, and
life expectancy is 53 years.
   The 8,300-member army is a way out of poverty for men. Women run
the households, care for the children and support the economy in
countless ways.
   Most of the distribution and sale of crops is carried out by
peasant women who walk long distances in the mountains to sell
their goods at outdoor markets.
   Women called ``Madames Sara,'' for a migratory bird, handle most
of the trade with the rest of the Caribbean, traveling to the
Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Curacao, and Panama to
buy kitchenware, shoes and food for sale at home.
   Government tax incentives and low wages attract foreign-owned
manufacturing plants that produce electronics, clothing and
sporting goods for sale abroad, mostly in the United States. Women
make up about 75 percent of the factory workers, who are paid only
$3.20 a day.
   Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto
Rico, said women's conomic contribution is ``overwhelming.''
   ``Though we don't have the data, I believe women produce the
better part of Haiti's GNP,'' he said.
   About 80 percent of Haitian mothers raise their children alone.
Marriage is commonly viewed as a preserve of the upper class and
most children are born out of wedlock.
   Couples who live together consider themselves married, but men
have no legal obligation to pay child support or alimony. Men
change wives at will and may have several at the same time.
   ``Men run around a lot to prove their virility,'' said Irene, a
22-year-old housemaid who asked that only her first name be used.
   Claudette Werleigh, social affairs minister and the Cabinet's
only woman, said men often have several ``wives'' in a lifetime.
   ``Among the poor, the man has many women, so he is absent,'' she
said. ``He escapes the problems, the sick children, the crying.''
   Haiti has an infant mortality rate of 135 per 1,000 births,
highest among Western nations, and women tend to have several
children so a few will survive. Children are a woman's protection
when the man leaves, and often go to work when very young.
   ``The only thing a woman has to look forward to in Haiti is that
her children will have a better life than she does,'' said Mrs.
Bazin, the sociologist. ``They are her insurance policy, and she
will slave so her child can get an education.''
   Violence against women is common, but usually goes unreported
because abused women have nowhere to turn.
   ``There are no women's shelters,'' said Lilian Pierre-Paul, a
popular radio newscaster. ``When they are beaten they come here.
They come on foot, in trucks, to talk to me and ask for help.''
   Feminists say attempts to organize have been difficult because
Haitian women's priority is economic survival. ``Women don't have
time to go to meetings,'' said Michele de Ronceray, a sociologist
and political activist.
   Women's groups have sprung up in recent years, however, and some
observers see Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's government as a turning point.
   ``We go the countryside and women are saying they are concerned
about their lives,'' said Daniele Fouchard, founder of am education
and health center for illiterate women and children that has 300
branches.
   ``For years, they weren't able to say what they were thinking;
they were afraid to talk,'' she said. ``People are thinking
something can change with a new person, with a woman as president.''

<HEAD>Student Groups Plan Spring Offensive Against ROTC Anti-Gay Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College campuses across the country will be
the scene of a spring offensive in the battle between gay activists
and the Pentagon over its policy barring homosexuals from military
service.
   Activists led by a University of Wisconsin-Madison group are in
the process of organizing simultaneous news conferences to take
place May 4. The thrust will be joint attacks on Reserve Officer
Training Corps programs that exclude homosexuals from receiving
financial aid or being commissioned as officers.
   The groundswell of student interest has come as a surprise to
some national gay leaders. Until ROTC emerged as an issue last year
on college campuses, gay activists had been focusing primarily on
the courts and Congress in their effort to change Pentagon policy.
   ``I don't understand this _ why the schools in the Midwest are
getting so revved up about this, but they are,'' said Sue Hyde,
director of the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project, based in
Washington.
   In recent weeks, Hyde said, she has fielded inquiries from
students and faculty at about a dozen schools seeking information
and advice on how to shake up their ROTC chapters or continue
protests already begun.
   The effort has begun to show some results. Several universities
already have written the Pentagon warning that ROTC's future on
campuses is in jeopardy unless the policy changes. In a recent
letter to the Defense Department, John M. Deutch, provost of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the exclusion of
homosexuals runs counter to MIT's ``priniciple of
non-discrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual
orientation.''
   About 96,000 students participate in ROTC programs on 585
campuses, according to the Defense Department.
   In 1989 alone, students or faculty at least six schools _ the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, Yale, Harvard, the University of
Minnesota, Northwestern and the University of Iowa law school _
took action against ROTC chapters for their discriminatory
policies. Those actions ranged from barring ROTC from using Iowa
law school buildings to refusing to reinstate the corps at Harvard
and Yale. (ROTC was ousted from the latter two campuses 20 years
ago to protest the Vietnam War.)
   At the University of Wisconsin, the student and faculty senates
voted in December to recommend that the board of regents phase out
ROTC by 1993 unless the military changes its anti-gay policy. The
following month, Chancellor Donna Shalala instead recommended
working within the system to pressure the Pentagon and allowing the
ROTC to remain indefinitely.
   Many students contend that Shalala's solution violates the
university's own anti-discrimination policy and a state law
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, said
Jordan Marsh, university affairs director of the Wisconsin Student
Association.
   ``I think it's important to start a comprehensive mobilization
effort,'' said Marsh, a senior who is organizing the simultaneous
news conferences. He said he has invited about 120 colleges to
participate.
   Alan Berube, a San Francisco-based historian whose book ``Coming
Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War
Two,'' was published this month, said he had just returned from a
talk at Chico State College in California and was surprised at how
quickly interest was spreading.
   ``The whole issue in the last six or eight months has become
much more public,'' he said.
   He pointed to the cases of Joe Steffan, a naval cadet who was
expelled from Anapolis for admitting his homosexuality, and James
Holobaugh, a former ROTC cadet at Washington University in St.
Louis who in January was denied an Army commission for the same
reason.
   At least two other ROTC cadets have also come out recently,
leading the military to try to make them pay back their
scholarships. Several dozen members of Congress have sent protest
letters to the Pentagon. The cases are still open.
   The Defense Department policy says flatly that ``homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.'' The Defense Department
contends that the presence of gay people would undermine
discipline, order and morale; and that homosexuals in the military
would be particularly susceptible to blackmail.
   However, internal Defense Department studies _ which the
Pentagon had tried to suppress but which leaked out anyway _
disputed those arguments and concluded that gay people perform
their military duties as well as straight people.
   Nevertheless, the military expels about 1,400 people every year
on charges of homosexuality, according to the DOD's own estimates.
   Nan Hunter, who heads the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the
American Civil Liberties Union in New York, predicted that campus
protests would resonate all the way to Washington.
   ``In general I think the tide is turning in our favor,'' she
said. ``I think the irrationality of the policy is becoming more
clear even within the military.''
   But gay leaders are divided on how and when change might come.
   Sue Hyde said she doesn't see the political courage in Congress
to pass even a symbolic amendment on the subject right now.
   Hunter said she does not see much evidence that the courts will
confront the military, either.
   ``There is a longstanding tradition of deference to military on
a whole range of issues,'' she said, pointing to the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that it was constitutional to discharge an Orthodox
Jew from the Air Force for wearing a yarmulke.
   Another option would be for President Bush to change the policy
by executive order, much as President Harry Truman integrated the
military in 1948.
   But Hyde said she believes change is still a long way off.
   ``One of the big questions we always grapple with at our project
meetings is, `What time is it?' meaning, do we think the moment is
really ripe for some kind of clear statement by Congress,'' she
said.
   If midnight is the goal of passing legislation, ``I think it's
about 6:30,'' she said. ``P.M.''

   Do celebrities really care about spotted owls,
the ozone layer and rain forests? Or are they simply tree-hugging
the cause of the week?
   The evidence suggests that while numerous entertainers _ actor
Ed Begley Jr. and singer Jackson Browne among them _ have adapted
environmentally friendly living practices, many others are slow to
practice what they preach.
   At a recent Beverly Hills benefit for the Brazilian rain forest,
an array of Hollywood celebrities _ superstars like Jane Fonda and
agent Michael Ovitz _ were warned of the dangers of global warming
and pollution.
   The 1,000 or so guests, who dined on organic foods, raised $1.2
million for the environment. Most carpooled, but the scores who
didn't went for their limos, which idled patiently, stretching for
blocks. Exhaust filled the evening air.
   It was scarcely an isolated slip. When Hollywood's blue-ribbon
Environmental Media Association held its first organizational
meeting at producer Norman Lear's house, EMA founders arrived in
Mercedes, BMWs, Rolls-Royces and other gas-guzzlers.
   Producer Ted Field and wife Susie, who hosted the Beverly Hills
rain forest benefit, are longtime contributors to the Natural
Resources Defense Council and charter members of EMA. They also
have been known to fly to their spacious Aspen home in a private
jet.
   ``It's great celebrities are getting involved,'' said Bob
Hattoy, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. ``But it's not about doing
lunch. It's about changing the way that we live. Lifestyles of the
rich and famous are often lifestyles of the wasteful and
indulgent.''
   ``The entertainment industry is symbolic of the values of
everyone in our culture,'' said Bonnie Reiss, who founded the Earth
Communications Office. ECO seeks to add environmental themes to
television shows and movies.
   ``We have to get the rich and famous to truly examine their
lifestyles,'' Reiss said.
   Environmentalism has yet to become Hollywood's flavor of the
month. It has long been the land of excess, and tradition does not
die easily.
   At an April news conference for ABC's Earth Day special,
celebrity performers were ferried to the event in _ you guessed it
_ limousines.
   Tom Cruise has visited the Amazonian rain forest and is a member
of the ECO. So is his next movie about global warming? Not quite.
Cruise stars next in ``Days of Thunder,'' a movie about the hardly
fuel-efficient sport of auto racing.
   Scientists estimate a third of all global-warming gases are
transportation-produced; neither Paramount Pictures nor Cruise's
publicist could say how many thousands of gallons of fuel were used
making ``Days of Thunder.''
   Olivia Newton-John, a top environmental activist, is damaging a
stretch of the Southern California coastline, her Malibu neighbors
have charged in a civil complaint.
   Newton-John and her husband have polluted the ocean with tons of
dirt and sand removed during the construction of their
6,000-square-foot home overlooking the beach, the complaint charges.
   ``It's blown way out of proportion,'' Newton-John said. ``I had
an environmental specialist look at the property. I care about the
environment.''
   Die-hard environmentalists don't wear furs or leather. So how
did people dress at the Beverly Hills rain forest benefit?
   Singer Don Henley, who performed at the fund-raiser, said he had
visited the cloakroom before coming on stage. What did he see?
``About a quarter of a million dollars' worth of dead animals.''
   Actor Begley is one of the handful of personalities who has
reordered his life to save the planet. He rides a bicycle or takes
the bus to work, has a compost heap in his backyard and has
installed 15-watt bulbs in his house.
   ``We don't need any more definition of environmental problems,''
Begley said. ``We need action.''
   David Zucker, co-director of ``Airplane!'' and the director of
``Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad,'' now drives an
electric car. Dennis Weaver, star of the TV series ``McCloud,'' has
designed an ``ecologically balanced'' house in Colorado.
   ``We're building it out of old tires packed with dirt,'' the
actor said. ``The electricity will come from solar cells and all
water will be heated by the sun.''
   Other leading earth activists include Ted Danson, Lloyd Bridges,
Hart Bochner and Melanie Mayron.
   Reiss said that Cruise organized a recycling program on the
``Days of Thunder'' set, lives in a modest house and rides his
motorcycle to save fuel.
   ``I feel Tom Cruise is extremely committed,'' Reiss said. ``Does
he have room to grow? Everyone has room to grow.''

   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that Perrier's

not naturally carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring

   The water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a

impurities in the gas are filtered out.

   A new securities rule designed to help big
institutions investing more than $100 million also should benefit
people across the country who never dabble on Wall Street,
regulators said.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144a will make it
easier for big banks, insurance companies and pension funds to
trade in unregistered stocks and bonds that may not be sold to the
general public.
   The SEC requires companies offering stock to the public to
register and make extensive disclosures about their ownership,
financing and other issues to protect American investors.
   But the agency voted Thursday to ease restrictions on trading
privately offered securities, which aren't required to register and
aren't bound by disclosure regulations.
   The 4-0 vote applies only to institutional investors that can
prove they are big enough to handle the risk of dealing in
unregistered securities. But SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said
the measure would have a broader impact.
   ``We hope this rule will have a beneficial effect even on people
who don't buy securities at all,'' Breeden told reporters after the
meeting.
   ``To the extent that we can reduce the cost of U.S. companies
raising capital, that'll benefit the people who work for those
companies, benefit the U.S. economy broadly by helping make us more
competitive.''
   Breeden noted that some estimates put the market for privately
placed securities at $170.4 billion last year, up from $15.8
billion in 1980.
   But two congressional leaders expressed concern about ``the
possible development of a two-tiered securities market for U.S.
investors, one public and one private.''
   In a letter to Breeden released after Thursday's vote, Reps.
John D. Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., asked the
SEC to report periodically to Congress on the new rule's impact.
   Dingell, powerful head of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, and Markey, chairman of its finance committee which
oversees the SEC, said they also were concerned that Rule 144a may
be ``beyond the scope of the powers of the commission'' because it
allows for exemption from registration _ and thus disclosure _
requirements.
   ``Full and fair disclosure of the character of securities'' sold
across state lines is a key element of federal securities law, they
said.
   The rule sets a $100 million threshold for participating in the
private placement market to screen out unsophisticated investors
who might not be able to make wise choices without the disclosures
required on public offerings.
   Registered broker-dealers that either own and manage $10 million
in securities, or act as riskless principals for qualified
institutional buyers, are exempt from the $100 million requirement.
Banks and savings and loans, on the other hand, must have a net
worth of $25 million in addition to holding at least $100 million
in securities.
   The move is expected to lower the cost of raising money for U.S.
companies while wooing foreign corporations _ sometimes put off by
onerous U.S. disclosure requirements _ to raise capital here.
   The SEC also approved rule changes that would: make the National
Association of Securities Dealers' PORTAL trading system the market
place for such unregistered securities; and clarify regulations
governing foreign transactions of unregistered securities.
   ``This is an historic day for the commission and its
international program,'' said Breeden, who has been pushing to make
the U.S. securities laws and markets more competitive with foreign
markets.
   ``These rules will have a profound and beneficial effect upon
the ability of issuers to raise capital in the context of today's
global marketplace, and will enhance the competitiveness and
efficiency of our domestic markets,'' Breeden said at the beginning
of the three-hour meeting before a standing room only crowd of more
than 200.

   Dayton Hudson Co. said its winning $1.04 billion
bid for Marshall Field &amp; Co. gave it a ``once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity'' to add one of the nation's top retailing names to its
Midwest department store chain.
   The Minneapolis retailer beat out several bidders, including a
group of Field's managers, to win the 24-store chain. The company
expects to complete the deal within two months.
   ``The fact is that the Dayton Hudson bid was clearly superior in
financial terms,'' said Arthur Martinez, senior vice president of
Batus Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Field's current owner, BAT
Industries PLC of Britain.
   Dayton Hudson Chairman Kenneth Macke said the company had no
plans to close any of Field's stores in Illinois, Texas, Ohio and
Wisconsin, or make dramatic changes in strategy. He also reiterated
a commitment to continue the renovation of Field's flagship store
in Chicago's Loop.
   ``We view this as a once in a lifetime opportunity,'' Macke said
at a Chicago news conference. ``This is a great strategic fit for
us.''
   Analyst Marcia Raley of Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis agreed.
   ``I think it's a very very strong strategic bid for them,'' she
said, adding that the price appeared fair.
   She said the deal stands out given the current distress in the
retailing industry, where the bankruptcy filing of Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. has raised fears of
possible fire sales of store chains to raise cash.
   ``There's been a lot of distressed merchandise that has been on
the market,'' Raley said. ``But Marshall Field is not a distressed
operation _ it's a very high-quality operation.''
   The acquisition will be financed with internally generated funds
and debt, Dayton Hudson said. The company does not plan an equity
offering.
   ``We will have absolutely no problem financing the deal,'' said
Macke, adding junk bonds would play no role in the purchase.
   Dayton Hudson's stock fell $1.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange
to $69.12{ Thursday.
   Philip Miller, Field's chairman and chief executive and the man
widely credited with helping turn Field's around in the past five
years, said he was disappointed his management team had lost the
bidding. He said he was taking a wait-and-see attitude for the
moment.
   ``We don't have any indication as to what Dayton-Hudson's plans
are,'' Miller said. ``Until we understand that, we're encouraging
all our people to keep their powder dry.''
   While saying it was too early to discuss management changes,
Macke and Dayton Hudson President Stephen Watson said they planned
to meet with Miller soon.
   ``Phil Miller and his team have done an extraordinary job ... of
building this company,'' Watson said.
   Others said to be in the bidding were May Department Stores Co.,
based in St. Louis, and Dillard Department Stores Inc., based in
Little Rock, Ark.
   BAT put Marshall Field up for sale last year as part of a
restructuring to defend itself against a hostile takeover bid by
Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT, a British conglomerate with interests ranging from tobacco
to financial services to retailing, also is selling Saks Fifth
Avenue.
   Dayton Hudson's department store division operates 37 stores
known as either Dayton's or Hudson's in seven Midwestern states.
   Dayton Hudson also owns the Target chain, one of the country's
biggest discounters with 408 stores in 32 states, and Mervyn's, a
moderate-priced department store company with 221 stores in 15
states.
   In 1989, the department store division had an operating profit
of $179 million on revenues of $1.8 billion. The division employs
22,000 people.

<HEAD>Norwood Candy Distributor, Nine Associates Named in Racketeering
Indictment</HEAD>

   The owner of a multimillion-dollar candy
enterprise has been arrested on federal racketeering charges of
kidnapping, burning vehicles and assaulting rivals to squelch
competition in 30 states, authorities said.
   Formed in 1958, the enterprise created at least 20 seemingly
charitable organizations that employed hundreds of teen-agers who
went door-to-door selling candy, according to a federal indictment
unsealed Thursday.
   The money was never delivered to charity, going instead into the
pockets of Gerald Winters of Norwood, a community just west of New
York City, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said.
   ``The Winters group operated a 20-year reign of terror,''
Jeremiah Doyle Jr., assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's
Newark office, said at a news conference.
   If convicted, Winters, 49, faces up to 135 years in prison and
$2 million in fines. Nine of his associates also were indicted on
related extortion charges.
   Winters and one associate, Anthony Allen, 24, of Passaic, were
being held without bail after their arrests by FBI agents on
Thursday.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald J. Hedges scheduled a bail hearing for
Winters for this afternoon. A bail hearing for Allen was scheduled
for Monday.
   Four other Winters associates also were arrested Thursday, and
authorities continued to search for four others.
   The indictment, the result of a three-year investigation,
alleges that Winters and the others threatened the lives and
property of competitors and others, beat them and burned vehicles.
Prosecutors cited 22 separate incidents of violence in 10 states
between January 1971 and October 1988.
   The indictment does not mention any charges of abuse or
exploitation of youths who sold candy.
   ``It was a profitable organization that made money over a long
period of time,'' he said.
   Federal authorities began their investigation in October 1987
after Winters and two men named in the indictment allegedly
kidnapped a competitor, Alito said.
   The indictment alleges that Winters brought Carl Jonas from
Hawaii for a meeting in New Jersey, where he was beaten with a
baseball bat and kept hostage for two days at a home in River Edge.
The indictment did not say how or where Jonas was released, and
Alito said he could not comment beyond the indictment.
   Winters-operated organizations for which youths went
door-to-door selling candy include: American Youth Club; Arizona
Teens; Bay Area Teens; California Youth Club; Fund Raiser Products;
Future Careers; Goals Unlimited; Inner City Youth Corps; Junior
Careers; Junior Salesmen of America; Junior Salesmen of Florida;
Midwestern Youth Opportunities; Midwest Teens; Student Aid Program;
Student Work Program; Team Youth Program; Wisconsin Youth Club;
Youth Advancement; Youth Careers and Youth Incentives.
   Names under which the Winters operated organizations in New
Jersey include: Ron Kelso Marketing Program, Inc.; Kelron
Associates, Inc.; Miller Candy Sales, Inc.; Winters Candy Co.,
Inc.; Winters Equipment Co., Inc.; Automobile Dealers Leasing,
Inc.; Fund Raiser Products, Inc.; Global Home Products Co., Inc.;
Rothschild Candy, Inc.; International Candy and Food Co., Inc.;

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Stop to Norton Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts lawmakers united to urge the
Bush administration to block a British conglomerate's hostile
takeover bid for Norton Co.
   All 13 members of the state's congressional delegation argued
that the Worcester, Mass., abrasives maker is the leader in a field
with defense and national security applications. The lawmakers
attended a news conference Thursday at the Capitol calling for
federal action to stop the takeover attempt by BTR PLC.
   ``Norton is Worcester,'' said Rep. Joseph Early. ``Norton is the
world's leading manufacturer of abrasives and the largest employer
in Worcester.''
   The jobs of Norton's 3,100 employees would be jeopardized, Early
said, if a foreign owner decided to relocate or sell off Norton's
assets.
   The delegation signed a joint letter to President Bush urging
him to step in and block the takeover. Early said the delegation
would unveil legislation next week designed to make it easier for
the president to act.
   A law already on the books allows the president, following an
investigation, to block a foreign takeover if it would threaten
national security. It has been invoked only once.
   A BTR spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the
existing law is ``inapplicable'' to BTR.
   ``BTR and its subsidiaries in the U.S. have sensitive and
secretive clearance with the Department of Defense and other
federal government agencies,'' the spokesman said. ``We believe
those clearances are more sensitive than Norton's.''
   The spokesman added that BTR has no plans to move Norton's
headquarters or lay off workers.
   The stance taken by the congressional delegation came a day
after Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a law that would prevent BTR
from wresting immediate control over the Norton board.
   The law requires Massachusetts companies to elect directors over
staggered terms, with one-third being elected at a time. That would
prevent BTR from replacing a majority of directors at Norton's
annual meeting next Thursday.
   Norton tried to delay the meeting for two months, but that move
was blocked this week by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   Norton also has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that
state law prohibits BTR from exercising any voting power at
Norton's shareholders meeting. BTR called Norton's claim
``frivolous.''
   A key player in the effort to involve President Bush in the
Norton battle is likely to be Rep. Silvio Conte, the only
Republican in the delegation and the most senior member from
Massachusetts.
   ``When a foreign company attempts to acquire an American company
that has important industrial and technological capabilities, the
president is required to determine if the acquisition is in the
best interests of our national security,'' Conte said.
   ``Norton's research projects, manufacturing technologies and
government contracts are of great importance to our national
security and our industrial base.''

<HEAD>Trustee Says Eastern Is Back on Course; Union Leaders See End
Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto MH1</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man appointed to take control of Eastern
Airlines from Frank Lorenzo told customers the troubled carrier was
back on course after a bitter court fight for the cockpit.
   ``I want to reassure the community of travel agents and the
flying public that Eastern is flying, that it is flying safely and
reliably, and with an unparalleled level of service and
enthusiasm,'' said Martin Shugrue, who was appointed trustee to run
the airline.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., endorsed
Shugrue Thursday as an ``able'' manager and promised to work with
him to try to turn the airline around.
   Eastern's Machinists, meanwhile, celebrated Lorenzo's ouster and
the prospect of an end to their 13-month strike, although they
acknowledged they faced the prospect of still more hard times ahead.
   ``There obviously is going to be tremendous sacrifices over the
next year, maybe two years or more, to bring us back to normalcy
... but it's not going to be done in the interest of Frank
Lorenzo,'' Eastern Machinist president Charles Bryan told about 100
strikers at union headquarters near Miami International Airport.
   After a four-day hearing in New York City that offered some
harsh assessments of Lorenzo's stewardship, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland late Wednesday granted the request of Eastern's
unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee.
   The creditors, who are owed about $980 million, were angered by
Eastern's continuing losses and management's plans to slash debt
repayments. It was sweet news for the unions, which had sought
Lorenzo's departure since Eastern filed for bankruptcy in March
1989, five days into a crippling strike.
   ``Frank Lorenzo has finally been exposed as the incompetent,
conniving, greedy airline wrecker he is,'' said Machinists national
president George Kourpias.
   Shugrue is a former president of Eastern's sister carrier,
non-union Continental Airlines. He resigned from Continental under
pressure from Lorenzo last year.
   In an interview Thursday, Lorenzo said the decision to let
Shugrue go was made by Continental's board of directors. He also
said he wouldn't appeal Shugrue's appointment and pledged to work
with him.
   ``We're going to help in all reasonable ways that we can,''
Lorenzo said. ``Marty is an able airline operator. And he's going
to have our support.''
   Some analysts were encouraged by the naming of Shugrue.
   ``There aren't a lot of messiahs standing on street corners,''
said Robert Joedicke of Shearson Lehman Hutton. ``As far as
understanding the industry and the relationships at Texas Air,
Marty's probably the best qualified man out there.''
   However, the change at the top could prompt some Eastern
managers to leave, Lorenzo said.
   ``It's very difficult to project the future. There may well be
people leaving ... but we're just going to have to see,'' he said.
   Strikers, however, are eager to return.
   ``If it was up to me, I'd be back to work today,'' said Willie
Washington, 47, who worked part-time as a substitute teacher during
the strike.
   ``Our main goal now is getting back to work,'' said Frank Ortis,
president of the Machinists' Miami local. ``But we will remain on
strike until an agreement is reached. We've worked too hard to make
any moves now that we'd regret later.''
   Bryan said Thursday night he had had only ``a brief introductory
conversation'' with Shugrue. ``I hope to probably speak with him
tomorrow, get things started,'' he added.
   About 7,500 of the 9,000 Machinists who walked off the job last
year have said they'd go back to Eastern, Ortis said. About 2,500
workers could be brought back immediately following a strike
settlement, he added.
   Eastern shrank considerably during the strike. Billionaire
Donald Trump bought its profitable Northeast shuttle last year, and
American Airlines has received tentative federal approval to
acquire its Latin American routes.
   Eastern spokesman Bob Hunter said the court's decision to
release $80 million from escrow will keep the carrier in the air
through mid-1990. All reservation systems and flier-incentive
programs will remain in effect.
   ``It's still business as usual,'' said Hunter.

<HEAD>Cash Seems The Right Stuff to Jittery Japanese Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hottest investment in Tokyo this year is cash.
   With uncertainty reigning over Japan's stock and bond markets
and U.S. Treasury bond prices tumbling, many investment managers
have sought shelter for their funds.
   They are finding it in Tokyo's overnight money markets,
short-term certificates of deposit and other interest-bearing cash
investments, brokers and analysts say.
   True, this week's rebound in the yen and in stock prices have
led some analysts to believe the bear market might be over. But
they have not washed away the caution.
   ``People are hiding in cash and CDs from all of the unpleasant
possibilities,'' said William H. Brown, president the investment
advisory firm of Scudder Stevens and Clark (Overseas).
   The rate for unsecured overnight call loans, the shortest-term
cash investment, has been above 7 percent recently. That's less
than a quarter percentage point below the yield on the benchmark
10-year Japanese government bond.
   What's more, three-month certificates of deposit have been
quoted on the open market this week at more than 7.5 percent.
   Such high rates offer investors a rewarding hedge for their
money while market turbulence continues.
   ``Who wants to be the first to stick out their neck by taking a
stand, when you can get those kinds of rates on the overnight
calls?'' said one dealer, who spoke on the condition she not be
identified.
   ``If I'm 20 percent in cash and you're 40 percent in cash and
the equities market crashes again, who wins? You do.''
   At County NatWest Securities, analyst David Threadgold remarked,
``I'd be very surprised if a lot more money weren't going into
cash.''
   As a result, Japan's money supply is growing far faster than the
economy with its relatively stable prices justifies, according to
the Bank of Japan.
   The broad money supply, which includes short-term instruments,
rose 11.7 percent from January through March, the central bank
reported this week. In that period, the stock market has lost a
quarter of its value, the yen has fallen more than 10 percent
against the dollar, and government bond prices have dropped to
about 85 percent of their face value.
   The central bank had forecast only a 9 percent expansion of the
money supply for the quarter. Bank of Japan officials said a major
cause of the ``excessive'' growth was the ``merry-go-round'' of
funds slushing through cash instruments as investors darted in and
out of various markets.
   The cash glut shows no sign of abating. The central bank now
predicts 11 percent money growth for the March-May quarter. That
could trigger a viscious spiral if fast money growth further erodes
the yen's value.
   ``It means more inflation, and that will result in higher
interest rates whether the BOJ does anything about it or not,''
Brown said.
   Turbulence in the U.S. bond market also is pushing money into
Japan's cash markets. A worsening of the U.S. inflation outlook
sent Treasury bonds plunging this week, driving the yield on the
bellwether 30-year bond up a quarter point this week to 8.84
percent Thursday.
   Some Japanese investors are selling U.S. Treasuries, long a
staple of overseas investment for them, and repatriating the money,
dealers said.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a currency dealer with Daiwa Bank, said the
yen's rise this week resulted partley from life insurers selling
Treasury bonds and converting the proceeds into yen for short-term
investment in Japan.
   The popularity of cash investments indicates hesitation rather
than any fundamental shift in strategy, analysts said.
   Kinugasa said he thought the life insurers would probably
reinvest in U.S. Treasury bonds at next month's auction.
   Masahiro Yamada, general manager of overseas investments for
Nippon Life Insurance Co., possibly the biggest overseas investor
of all, said his firm will invest about the same amount abroad this
year as last. The only difference might be a stronger interest in
Western Europe and Canada, he said.
   Marshall Gittler of UBS Philips and Drew International said that
if money continues to pour into short-term investments and if
Japanese investors prove unenthusiastic at next month's U.S.
Treasury auction, the yen ``is bound to rise.''
   That would take pressure off short-term interest rates, he said.
With rates falling, it's possible ``greed would exceed fear,''
allowing the financial markets to rebound, he said.

   An international task force is recommending a
worldwide plan to uncover billions of dollars being hidden by
narcotics dealers through intricate money-laundering transactions.
   A major element of the plan, according to Deputy Treasury
Secretary John E. Robson, is a requirement that financial
institutions report questionable dealings by their customers.
   ``Specifically, the task force recommends that, as in the United
States, financial institutions must be able to report suspicious
transactions to law enforcement, in good faith, free from fear of
liability under secrecy laws,'' Robson said at a news conference
Thursday.
   ``Suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be very
valuable to U.S. law enforcement,'' he added.
   The 40 ``action recommendations'' were adopted by the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering on Feb. 7 in Paris and
announced Thursday by the participating nations. Robson headed the
U.S. delegation on the panel.
   The task force was established following last summer's economic
summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Paris to
assess current anti-money-laundering efforts and ``to consider
additional preventive efforts in this field.''
   In addition to the G-7 nations of Britain, Canada, France, West
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, task force members
included Austria, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and the European Community.
   President Bush and other leaders of the G-7 nations will
consider the recommendations at their July economic summit in
Houston, Robson said. Many of the recommendations will require
government approval elsewhere, but most already conform with U.S.
laws, he added.
   In addition to the reporting requirement, the task force
recommendations include requirements that financial institutions
adopt procedures to identify their customers and to maintain
adequate records about customers and their transactions.
   ``With money-laundering cases being investigated months and even
years after transactions take place, adequate recordkeeping is
essential,'' Robson said.
   ``At the same time,'' he added, ``the recommendations reflect a
recognition that law enforcement objectives need to be balanced
with burdens on the financial system.''
   He contended the recommendations would not transform financial
institutions into policemen.
   The task force report said the United Nations has estimated that
drug trafficking proceeds worldwide totaled $300 billion in 1987.
   Drug trafficking and money-laundering are ``inextricably
connected'' and require an international solution, Robson said.
Thus, ``countries must link together to have strong domestic
anti-money laundering programs for detection and prosecution and
must cooperate freely with each other in the many cases that cross
international borders.''
   The recommendations, he added, ``should establish a network of
comprehensive programs to address money-laundering and will
facilitate greater cooperation in international investigations,
prosecutions and property seizures.''

   Stock prices hovered in a narrow range today
against a background of continuing inflation and interest-rate
worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.47 to 2,714.41 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 411 up, 457 down and 548
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.60 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was dampened by renewed
upward pressure on interest rates over the past several days.
   Fears have been increasing in the financial world that the
increase in rates might hurt the chances for a recovery in
corporate earnings later in the year.
   Brokers said traders also were unsettled by the news late
Thursday that Moody's Investors Service was reviewing its ratings
of some of the debt of Citicorp. Such a move would come as a fresh
setback to the trouble-plagued U.S. banking industry.
   Citicorp shares fell } to 23&lsqb; in active trading. Stocks of other
prominent money-center bank holding companies were steady to
fractionally lower.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.11 to 185.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .10 at 350.83.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.94 to
2,711.94, extending its loss over the last two sessions to 53.83
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 489 up, 962 down and 537 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 152.93 million shares, against 147.13

<TEXT>
   Two major Canadian food companies, Maple Leaf
Mills and Canada Packers, plan to merge in a $1 billion deal
designed in part to build their competitiveness in the U.S. market,
it was announced today.
   The British owner of Maple Leaf Mills, Canada's biggest flour
miller, announced the plan for its subsidiary to join forces with
what is the country's largest public food-processing company.
   Hillsdown Holdings PLC will have a 56 percent stake in the
combined company under the proposed transaction which must be
approved by both companies' stockholders. Their boards of directors
back the proposal and are recommending that shareholders endorse it.
   The merger must be approved by Canadian regulators.
   ``The combination of these two businesses creates a powerful new
force in the North American food industry,'' said Harry Solomon,
chairman of Hillsdown. ``The size, scope and resources of the
combined company enables it to take full advantage of the
opportunities of the Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement.''
   Maple Leaf Mills, which was taken over by Hillsdown in August
1987, sells baked goods and poultry. Its brand name products
include Monarch flour and Dempster's bread.
   Canada Packers sells about $3 billion worth of food products
each year, which include the brand names York, Maple Leaf and
Tenderflake. It has been on the auction block since last October.
   The new company will have combined sales of $4 billion and will
be the largest publicly traded food-processing company in Canada
and one of the largest in North America, Hillsdown said in a news
release.
   Under the deal, Hillsdown will exchange its entire interest in
Maple Leaf Mills for approximately 29.5 million newly-issued Canada
Packers shares. That's equivalent to a 45-per-cent holding in the
new company.
   In addition, Hillsdown wants to buy $119 million worth of Canada
Packers shares at $16.50 per share to boost its holding in the new
company to a majority share of 56 per cent.
   Canada Packers shares ended trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange on Thursday at $13.25, down 38 cents on the day.
   The shares had soared to more than $20 after the company
announced it was up for sale last year but then sagged when no
offers for the company appeared. Analysts suggested the poor profit
of Canada Packers' meat division was discouraging potential buyers.
   The family of William McLean and their associates, who together
own 29 per cent of Canada Packers, have agreed to tender their
shares to the offer, Hillsdown said.
   Canada Packers employs about 12,000 people, while Maple Leaf
Mills employs 4,000. There was no immediate indication whether jobs
would be lost.

<HEAD>`Credit Crunch' or Prudent Lending?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It probably was inevitable that after the
debt-engorged 1980s, one of the first scares of the `90s would be
the fear that a shortage of credit would tilt the economy into
recession.
   After all, with estimates of the thrift bailout now reaching as
high as $500 billion and regulators keeping a closer eye on the
books, savings and loans won't be pushing out loans like the good
old days.
   Banks also are feeling the pinch of bad loans, as last week's
first quarter results showed clearly. Citicorp, the nation's
biggest bank and biggest real estate lender, reported a 56 percent
drop in profits, largely because of problems with loans for real
estate and corporate takeovers.
   The situation has raised anxiety on Capitol Hill. Responding to
a question from a congressman worried about businesses at home,
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that a
``large majority'' of the nation's top banks had become less
willing to make construction or land development loans.
   Does that add up to a growth-snuffing credit crunch? Many
analysts say not quite. To the extent that some borrowers are
getting turned down, it may not be a bad thing.
   Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics in
New York, says evidence seems clear that banks are extending less
credit. The amount of big certificates of deposit or interbank
deposits banks buy _ the raw material for their lending _ actually
has contracted over the past year, he says.
   One reason for the pullback is the growing effect of an
international agreement on capital standards, which will require
banks to hold capital equal to 8 percent of their assets as a
cushion against losses, Fabbri says. The standards require more
capital for riskier assets, so banks are likely to cut back first
on loans for smaller companies, construction and takeovers, he says.
   ``I think we're clearly at a point where we're witnessing banks
and thrifts reducing their extensions,'' Fabbri says. ``The small,
the less creditworthy borrowers no doubt will have less wherewithal
to expand.''
   But some other economists think the problem isn't a lack of
money to lend. It's a shortage of borrowers.
   Big companies haven't been borrowing much from banks in recent
months because it has been far cheaper to raise money via
commercial paper, the market for corporate IOUs, says Kevin Logan,
chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. Thirty-day
commercial paper costs just over 8.3 percent today, compared with
the bank prime rate of 10 percent.
   Logan concedes that some more speculative borrowers are facing a
squeeze, especially in areas like real estate, but he says that
only reflects a welcome return to more prudent lending after years
of easy money.
   Drop the ``credit crunch'' headline, he says. Make it read,
``Liquidity flood recedes.''
   Edward Yardeni, director of economics at Prudential-Bache
Securities, agrees.
   ``We would be more concerned about the outlook for the economy
if Mr. Robert Campeau was still buying department stores with other
people's money,'' he wrote in a recent forecast.
   ``We would be more concerned if Mr. Alan Bond was still
purchasing Van Goghs on margin from Sotheby's. We would be more
concerned if Mr. Michael Milken was still in business.''
   Tighter lending may hurt industries like construction and some
manufacturing sectors, Fabbri says, but it isn't likely to trigger
a widespread recession. That's because so much of the economy is
based on service industries that don't have big credit needs, he
says.
   Stricter lending also may reduce pressure on the Fed to raise
interest rates to stem inflationary pressures. That pressure heated
up last week with reports showing that inflation ran at an 8.5
percent rate in the first quarter _ an eight-year high _ while
industrial production surged.
   ``They don't have to raise interest rates to prevent credit
extension...because it's not happening anyway,'' Fabbri says of the
Fed.
   ``This should eventually lessen inflation pressure and help
reduce domestic demand for foreign goods.''

   Stock prices gave ground today in selling
attributed to continuing inflation and interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 53.83 points
Wednesday and Thursday, slipped 1.80 to 2,710.14 by 11 a.m. today

increase in rates might hurt the chances for a recovery in
corporate earnings later in the year.
   Brokers said traders also were unsettled by the news late

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain on Talk of Soviet Corn Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were slightly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid talk that
the Soviet Union bought at least one million metric tons of U.S.
corn in recent days.
   But there was no official confirmation of a large Soviet corn
purchase and doubters said this morning's lower cash corn prices
conflicted with the market rumors.
   One analyst who believed the Soviets bought corn said the lower
cash prices reflected a big jump in farmer selling of corn after
yesterday's moderate price rally.
   The analyst, William Biedermann of Allendale Inc., said there
was ``pretty good confirmation'' that the Soviets bought up to 2
million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   The futures markets were further supported by a weekly
Agriculture Department report showing strong export sales of U.S.
grains and soybeans, Biedermann said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.70 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to } cent higher wiith May at $2.77 a bushel; oats were \
cent to { cent higher with May at $1.58\ a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 2 cents higher with May at $6.01 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with April at
79.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with April at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with April at 57.75 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .78 cent higher with May at
62.20 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday,
paced by a sharp, technically inspired advance in pork belly
futures.

<HEAD>Tribune Co. Posts Profit Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tribune Co. Friday reported a 9 percent drop
in its first quarter earnings and blamed operating losses at the
New York Daily News and weakness in its newsprint business for the
slump in profitability.
   The company had net income of $33.5 million, or 43 cents per
share, in the three months ended April 1, down from $36.8 million,
or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to
$584 million from $553 million in 1989's first quarter.
   The company's holdings include the Chicago Tribune and Chicago
Cubs baseball team, television and radio stations in several major
markets as well as other newspaper holdings.
   Operating profit for Tribune Co.'s newspaper publishing group
declined 10 percent to $55.7 million from $61.6 million.
   The company said the decrease was due to larger operating losses
at the Daily News resulting from weaker market conditions and costs
related to contract negotiations with the newspaper's 10 unions.
   Operating profit improved for the rest of the newspaper group
largely due to stronger Chicago Tribune results and lower newsprint
costs, according to the company.
   The broadcasting and entertainment group reported operating
profit of $6.2 million, compared with a loss of $1.4 million in the
first quarter last year, with higher income at the company's
television stations given as the reason for the increase.
   Operating profit for the newsprint group sagged 63 percent to
$6.3 million despite a 4 percent increase in revenue to $114
million, Tribune said. A stronger Canadian dollar, lower newsprint
prices and higher shipment costs were given as reason for the
decline in profits of the group.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Announces Lower Profits, Hiring Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. today announced it has
implemented a white-collar hiring freeze after the company's profit
fell short of last year's performance for the second consecutive
quarter despite record sales.
   Caterpillar earned $99 million in the first three months of
1990, a 30 percent from from last year when the first-quarter
profit was $141 million.
   The quarterly income translates to 97 cents per share of common
stock for Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largest
manufacturer of earth-moving equipment. In the first quarter of
1989, per-share income was $1.39.
   ``We certainly are not ecstatic but we're not extremely
disappointed,'' said Len Kuchan, Caterpillar treasurer. ``We won't
be happy until we get our costs down.
   ``The results are generally what we expected, although sales
were stronger than we anticipated,'' he said.
   Income dropped despite record first-quarter sales of $2.86
billion _ a 10 percent increase from the first quarter of 1989 when
Caterpillar reported sales of $2.62 billion.
   Total revenue, which includes sales plus revenue from financial
subsidiaries, was $2.9 billion for the quarter, the second-best
quarter in Caterpillar's 75-year history. The company's revenue was
$2.68 billion in the same quarter last year.
   The all-time high for revenue was $3.04 billion in the second
quarter of 1989.
   The hiring freeze applies to all management or salaried
employees, said Kuchan.
   He said a company reorganization, which created profit-driven
management centers, has resulted in a reduction of
middle-management jobs and some salaried workers.
   Workers with two years experience or more have been given the
opportunity to be retrained for new jobs or wait in a transitional
pool of displaced workers until an opening is created.
   Kuchan said no layoffs of salaried, or blue-collar workers, is
anticipated in 1990, although they could occur if the nation's
economy sinks into a recession.
   Kuchan blamed the low profit level on increased costs due to
soaring health care expenses, plant modernization programs, higher
material costs and the trouble in key markets.
   He said the U.S. housing industry has been sluggish, along with
commercial and industrial development, giving Caterpillar fears of
a recession.
   Overseas, the company has been hurt by ecomonic chaos in Brazil
and recessions in Australia and the United Kingdom.

   The U.S. dollar rose in late European trading
Friday in a spurt of buying before the weekend.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers noted that European activity was modest despite short
covering, which is the act of buying dollars to fulfill previous
agreements to sell them.
   Traders in Frankfurt, West Germany, said there was some
scattered buying interest following a report that Soviet soldiers
had stormed a Communist Party printing plant in Lithuania, but they
said the news had little lasting impact on the dollar. The dollar
is often seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil.
   Uncertainties about the proposed currency union between West and
East Germany continued to cast a shadow over trading, Frankfurt
dealers said.
   Some dealers in London said U.S. and Japanese dealers were still
inclined to buy dollars while others anticipated further dollar
weakness next week.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo Friday at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen
from Thursday's close. In late trading in London, the dollar rose
to 157.90 yen.
   The dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.6357 to
buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6448 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Thursday's levels
were: 1.6895 West German marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4910 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4815; 5.6695 French francs, up from 5.6325;
1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8820; 1,240.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,231.25; and 1.1619 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1618.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6375 marks,
158.05 Japanese yen, 1.4917 Swiss francs, 1.1625 Canadian dollars
and 1,238.50 Italian lire.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $374.75 a troy
ounce, down from $376.55 per ounce late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $376.50, up from $376.25 late
Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped 11 cents an ounce to close at $377.69
an ounce.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $5.08 a troy ounce,
down from $5.10 per ounce late Wednesday.

   Fashion is losing to flora and fauna with a
House vote to ban strip mining the scenic beds of New Mexico's
Jemez River for the pumice used in making stone-washed jeans.
   A bill, approved 391-1 on Thursday, would put the 11 miles of
the East Fork of the river under the protection of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems.
   It also protects 20.5 miles of the Pecos River from anyone who
would permanently change the contours of the land, such as in the
strip-mining of block pumice used by jeans manufacturers.
   The section of the Jemez River being protected features rugged
canyons, thick forests, lush meadows and is a popular trout stream
that also provides a habitat for the unique Jemez Mountain
Salamander.
   The segment of the Pecos River is known for granite canyons,
waterfalls and mountain meadows.
   ``We had a legislative proposal to designate the rivers and at
the same time we had a regulatory action going forth on a mining
claim,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who sponsored the bill
with Reps. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., and Steven Schiff, R-N.M.
   ``In a very real sense, the East Fork of the Jemez River was the
nation's first river threatened by stone-washed jeans,'' Richardson
said.
   Vento said the mining would substantially change the surfaces
around the river.
   ``Congress has a right to designate the river and prevent this
type of misuse or abuse,'' he said.
   ``The mining claims in question within the proposed Jemez River
corridor are for pumice, a material used in the manufacture of
stone-washed jeans,'' said Rep. Nick Joe Rahall II, D-W.Va.
   ``For my part, I would forego the jeans in order to preserve the
environmental values of the river,'' he said.
   The bill would allow existing claimholders to mine land in the
river corridors, but maintains the land as federal property. It
would require that after mining, claimholders return the area to
its natural condition.
   The measure would prohibit the sale of mining patents under the
federal 1872 mining laws used by speculators looking for valuable
minerals.
   The block pumice found in rich quantities along the river is
considered a valuable mineral because it is difficult to find. Its
largest market is in the manufacturing of stone-washed blue jeans,
said a House Interior Committee staffer.
   The bill is supported by the administration. Similar legislation
already has passed the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Lyondell Petrochemical Co., spun off last year
from Atlantic Richfield Co., reported Friday a 41.8 percent
decrease in first quarter earnings as higher crude prices offset
increased sales.
   For the quarter ended March 31, the company's net income was $78
million, or 98 cents per share, compared with $134 million, or
$1.67, in the same quarter last year.
   Revenues increased 17.3 percent to $1.49 billion from $1.27
billion.
   Lyondell spokeswoman Jackie Wilson said the lower earnings were
mainly due to increased costs of crude oil, which helped push cost
of sales from $1.02 billion in the 1989 quarter to $1.32 billion
this year.
   Arco spun off Lyondell in early 1989 in a $1.2 billion initial
public offering, the third largest ever for an American company.
Los Angeles-based Arco retains about half of Lyondell's stock.
   Lyondell manufacturers petrochemicals including various plastics
and methanol, plus gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and lubricants.

second-quarter deliveries are at capacity levels for its principal

   ``The strong order book, improving cost performance and stable
prices in the steel segment, coupled with some improvement in steel
service center margins, promise better second-quarter results,'' he

<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. on Friday posted a 6.9 percent
profit gain on 4.1 percent sales growth for the first quarter as
strong earnings in the grocery and specialty foods division more
than compensated for an income decline in the snacks and
international consumer products unit.
   The company said it earned $63.1 million, or 43 cents a share,
in the three months ended March 31, up from $59.04 million, or 40
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose to $1.89 billion from $1.82 billion in 1989's first
quarter.
   Commenting on the results in remarks prepared for the company's
annual meeting, R.J. Ventres, chairman and chief executive officer,
said Borden's broad product diversity helped its profitability.
   ``Earnings in the Grocery and Specialty Products Division were
particularly strong, led by pasta and our niche grocery brands,''
Ventres said. ``This more than offset lower income in the Snacks
and International Consumer Products Division, where snack marketing
expenses were increased to counter heavy domestic competition.''
   Borden, which has its corporate headquarters in New York, makes
and markets products ranging from milk and other foods to glue,
adhesives and other industrial items.

   Federal prosecutors and attorneys for financier
Michael Milken continued negotiations over a possible settlement
Friday, but no plea deal or new indictment was announced.
   The government had promised to return a new, broader set of
charges by Friday in the racketeering and fraud case against the
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond executive.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were named in a 98-count indictment handed up in March 1989
alleging wideranging securities fraud violations including insider
trading in takeover deals.
   Lawyers for Milken, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office and the
Securities and Exchange Commission have been negotiating a possible
plea bargain to avoid what was expected to be a long and costly
trial.
   In addition to the criminal counts, Milken still must settle
civil allegations made by the SEC in 1988. Almost all the charges
against Milken are based on information supplied by former stock
speculator Ivan Boesky, who recently completed a prison term.
   Individuals close to the case said Friday that talks were
continuing. A U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman said no announcement
was planned related to the case.
   Under the terms of a reported plea offer by the government,
Milken would pay about $650 million in fines and plead guilty to
six felonies _ the same terms that Drexel agreed to in its
settlement last year.
   The government then would recommend that Milken serve a maximum
of five years in prison, but the length of any term would be up to
U.S. Disctrict Judge Kimba Wood.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that the government gave Milken
a Friday deadline to accept a plea bargain or face additional
charges in an expanded indictment.
   Prosecutors have said for more than a year that a new indictment
was planned. Milken pleaded innocent to the original charges and
has said through his attorneys that he planned to fight the case in
court.
   The Journal said negotiations also were over the extent to which
Milken would have to cooperate with the government in the future
and the status in the case of Lowell Milken, who worked as a lawyer
at Drexel and assistant to his brother.
   Milken resigned from Drexel last June to set up his own
consulting and investing firm. Drexel was forced to sever ties with
Milken under terms of its SEC settlement. Drexel has been
liquidating since its parent filed for bankruptcy court protection
in February.
   Milken, 43, is credited with reshaping corporate America in the
1980s through the use of high-yield bonds used to finance
businesses and takeovers. Once considered one of the most powerful
men in U.S. finance, Milken was paid more than $1 billion from
1983-87, including $550 million in 1987 alone.

   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures ended
narrowly mixed.
   The runup in soybean prices occurred despite a lack of
significant supply-and-demand news, largely reflecting efforts by
speculators to push values above their recent highs.
   After three days of strong gains this week, price charts
indicated the soybean marketwas ripe for a further advance, said
Anne Frick, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   ``This was largely a technically inspired trade. We made the
day's highs at mid-session, then the market backed off, then we had
a runup within the last 15 minutes to test the mid-session highs,''
she said.
   The May soybean contract failed to surpass its mid-session high
of $6.06 a bushel but still managed a respectable gain of about 18
cents on the week.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 1{ cents lower to 1}

   The stock market took another beating today in
selling ascribed to inflation and interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 53.83 points
Wednesday and Thursday, dropped 29.51 to 2,682.43 by 3 p.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 331 up, 1,154
down and 454 unchanged.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was dampened by renewed
upward pressure on interest rates over the past several days.
   Fears have been increasing in the financial world that the
increase in rates might hurt the chances for a recovery in
corporate earnings later in the year.
   Brokers said traders also were unsettled by the news late
Thursday that Moody's Investors Service was reviewing its ratings
of some of the debt of Citicorp. Such a move would come as a fresh
setback to the trouble-plagued U.S. banking industry.
   Citicorp shares fell ~ to 23 in active trading.

companies, Chase Manhattan dropped { to 27&lsqb;; Manufacturers Hanover

<HEAD>Citicorp Review Another Indication Of Big Bank Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major credit-rating agency's decision to
review the health of Citicorp's debts reflects the hard times the
banking industry is enduring with weakening foreign and real estate
loans.
   Several other insitutions already have had ratings on their
securities downgraded as credit agencies express concern over the
quality of the debt.
   ``It's hardly unusual,'' said Mara Hildeman, a senior analyst at
Moody's Investor Services Inc., which put some $31 billion of
Citicorp's senior debt undeis month downgraded $2.8 billion of First
Chicago Corp. senior debt by one notch, to A-3 from A-2. And last
month Marine Midland Banks Inc. saw Moody's lower its rating on
$1.3 billion of its senior debt, to Baa-1 from A-3.
   Moody's review of Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company
with $230 billion in assets, didn't send tremors through the
banking community.
   ``The industry is already shaken,'' said Mark Gross, a senior
vice president at IBCA Inc., the New York arm of the London-based
rating agency. The review of Citicorp ``just adds to it.''
   A lower credit rating could make it more expensive for Citicorp
to borrow money by prompting investors to demand higher interest to
compensate for increased risk. The ratings have no affect on
customer deposits.
   Currently, Citicorp outranks many banking institutions. Its
senior debt carries an A-1 rating, well above Moody's current
rating of some of Chemical Bank's debt.
   Moody's characterizes A-1 bonds as possessing ``many favorable
investment attributes.'' But ``elements may be present which
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.''
   Moody's pointed specifically to Citicorp's nonperforming loans
in real estate and to developing countries as well as loans made in
``highly leveraged transactions'' like buyouts financed mainly with
debt.
   According to IBCA, 7 percent of Citicorp's real estate loans,
excluding residential mortgages, were non-performing in 1989.
Though that figure does not rank Citicorp at much greater risk than
its peers, analysts expect the amount of nonperforming real estate
loans _ those on which payments are not being made _ to increase.
   ``Citicorp is fairly geographically diverse in its real estate
portfolio, but nevertheless, given their location in New York, they
have a fairly large concentration'' of loans in the Northeast,
where the economy is expected to deteriorate, Hildeman said.
   About 5 percent of Citicorp's highly leveraged transactions were
nonperforming, the fifth-worst showing in IBCA's review of 50 major
banks. But Citicorp has $7.8 billion in highly leveraged loans
outstanding, roughly twice as much as the next biggest player.
   In comparison, IBCA said that in 1989 Chase Manhattan Bank had
$4.5 billion in outstanding highly leveraged debt, 1.1 percent of
which was nonperforming.
   In terms of capital ratios, in which assets are adjusted to
reflect total risk to the corporation, Citicorp barely met the
government's minimum 4 percent requirement. With a ratio of 4.04
percent, Citicorp ranked 49th out of 51 institutions, although the
bank is in the process of raising its capital ratios.
   Once a company is under review, Moody's likes to act quickly
before speculation runs rampant.
   ``I don't see how they can downgrade (Citicorp) very much,''
said Anthony Naylor, a senior vice president of fixed-income
securities at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc. ``And one notch isn't going to
make a whole lot of difference. Citicorp isn't in the credit
squeeze that some regional banks are ... It's so diversified,'' he
said.
   If Moody's takes action, it might ``encourage (Citicorp
management) to be more quick in terms of what they do to remedy the
situation,'' said Richard Mueller, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps in
Chicago.
   ``No bank likes to see any downgrading, but it brings more
sharply into focus the issues management has to deal with,'' he
said.
   Earlier this week Citicorp reported its first-quarter earnings
declined 56 percent, mainly because of problems with weakening real
estate loans.

<HEAD>Tentative Deal to Sell Avon's Japanese Unit Appears Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc.'s tentative deal to sell its
majority interest in a Japanese subsidiary to one of that country's
private mail order companies appears to have fallen apart.
   The cosmetics company said Friday that Tokyo-based Friends of
Freesia Co. Ltd. had notified Avon that it will not close on the
$450 million deal by April 27, the rescheduled closing date.
   The Japanese company had sought to postpone the closing again,
this time until late June. The original closing date of March 30
already had been put off for a month at Freesia's request. Avon
said it turned down the second request and plans to pursue other
options.
   Avon still intends to sell all or part of its 60 percent stake
in Avon Japan. The company said it will resume discussions with
other interested Japanese investors after April 27.
   ``We are confident we will sell our interest in Avon Japan this
year,'' Avon spokesman John Cox said.
   He said after April 27 Avon plans to collect the $6.3 million
held in escrow while the deal was pending.
   Avon did not say why Freesia balked at completing the deal. Cox
said Avon Japan's shares have not suffered a significant price
erosion during this year's slump on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The deal between Avon and Freesia, which has interests in direct
mail marketing, land development as well as hotel and hospital
management, was announced Feb. 21.
   Freesia and the company's president, Veji Sasaki, had agreed to
pay $408 million at the closing, which included $338 million in
cash and $70 million in advance royalties on future sales. Another
$42 million in advance royalties was to be paid 18 months after the
transaction was completed.
   Avon, the world's biggest direct seller of beauty products, made
a decision to withdraw from Japan after concluding that it would be
too costly to try to prosper there, an intensely competitive
environment in which Avon has had little success expanding its
market share.
   Proceeds from the sale of the Japanese stake will be used to
reduce Avon's debt, the company has said in the past.

   A Swedish gas station chain is
introducing a robot pump that fills the tank while the driver sits
in the car, a company official said Friday.
   The robot's arm is guided to the fuel tank by a radar signal
that reacts to a reflector on the tank's cap, said Per Soderberg of
the OK gas company. The pump is activated by a plastic credit card.
   It takes only 90 seconds to put about 13 gallons of gas into the
car, compared with 3{ minutes when the driver has to get out, open
the tank, fill up, and return to the driver's seat, Soderberg said
   A prototype has been in operation since October, he said, and
the robot will go into commercial use before the end of 1990.

<HEAD>Inventor Of Campbell's SpaghettiOs And Chunky Soup Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man behind the creation of SpaghettiOs
and Campbell's Chunky Soup is retiring after a 35-year career with
the food-products giant, Campbell Soup Co. announced Friday.
   Donald E. Goerke, 62, who led creative teams that developed the
products that have combined sales of more than $500 million, is
retiring on May 1, the company said in a statement.
   ``He's the guy who got the idea and brought it to fruition,''
said company spokesman James H. Moran. ``He's generally regarded as
the inventor.''
   Goerke cooked up the idea for Franco-American SpaghettiOs in the
mid-60s to create demand in the canned pasta market. SpaghettiOs
were introduced in 1965 with a catchy slogan ``Uh-Oh! SpaghettiOs!''
   Campbell owns Franco-American, in addition to Pepperidge Farm,
Vlasic Foods, Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, Godiva Chocolatier and Casera
Foods.
   ``We were looking for a product that would especially appeal to
kids,'' said Goerke. ``We looked at hundreds of different pasta
possibilities and decided that spaghetti shaped like small circles
would be a hit with kids.''
   In the late 1960s, Goerke began working on increasing Campbell's
soup sales. He helped develop Chunky varieties _ the first major
Campbell soup line that was not condensed.
   ``The company was build on condensed soup and we had to overcome
a lot of skepticism to introduce a ready-to-serve soup,'' recalled
Goerke, who joined the company in 1955 as a marketing analyst.
   He is currently a manager of a microwave soups division.
   Goerke, of Riverton, said he plans to form a marketing
consulting business when he retires.

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed higher on world currency
markets Friday as investors sought a safe haven amid heightened
tensions between Lithuania and the Soviet Union.
   Gold prices mostly were lower. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold bullion settled at $376.60 a troy ounce, off 60
cents from Thursday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $376.25 an ounce, down 75 cents.
   Traders said the market focused on events in the Soviet Union,
where the government toughened its economic embargo against
Lithuania by diverting some shipments of food, metal, wood and
industrial parts.
   Earlier this week the Kremlin cut off most of the natural gas
and all of the oil it supplies to the Baltic republic, which is
attempting to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Further rocking the currency market was a report that dozens of
Red Army soldiers stormed a Lithuanian printing plant and beat at
least a dozen people.
   In times of world turmoil, investors flock to the dollar, which
is viewed as a ``safe-haven'' currency.
   As tensions in the Soviet Union escalate, the market is
concerned over ``the possibility that either the U.S. or Europe
will be drawn into it,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Volume was heavy. Shortly after midday, the dollar took a dive
as traders turned their sights to weakening U.S. stock and bond
markets, but the currency managed to finish higher.
   Earlier in Europe, the dollar rose in modest activity.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen from
Thursday's close. In late trading in London, the dollar rose to
157.90 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 157.50 yen, up from
157.25 yen on Thursday.
   The British pound declined to $1.6357 in London from $1.6448
late Thursday. Later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.6388 from
Thursday's $1.6450.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.6872 West German marks, up from 1.6787;
1.4895 Swiss francs, up from 1.4847; 5.6655 French francs, up from
5.6425; 1,238.20 Italian lire, up from 1,233.50, and 1.1628
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1623.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates, included: 1.6895 West German marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4910
Swiss francs, up from 1.4815; 5.6695 French francs, up from 5.6325;
1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8820; 1,240.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,231.25; and 1.1619 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1618.
   Gold prices were mixed overseas. Gold traded in London at a late
bid of $374.75 a troy ounce, down from $376.55 per ounce late
Thursday. In Zurich, the bid for gold was $376.50 an ounce, up from
$376.25. In Hong Kong, gold dropped 11 cents to close at $377.69 a
troy ounce.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.099 a troy ounce from
$5.067 on Thursday. In London silver traded at a bid of $5.08 a
troy ounce, down from $5.10.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Sink On Improved Supply Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid improved supply prospects and perceptions
that demand for the metal is entering a seasonal decline.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; coffee
futures climbed; energy futures were mixed; livestock and meat
futures were mixed; and soybeans advanced while grain futures were
mixed.
   Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 4.05 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April down 1.5 cents at $1.185 a pound and
the most-active May contract off 4.05 cents at $1.1255.
   Analysts attributed much of the selling to speculation that
Monday's weekly London Metal Exchange stocks report will show a
rise of as much as 15,000 metric tons in supplies of copper
certified as deliverable on the exchange.
   The expectation of larger London stocks reflects a general
perception that copper demand is declining, fabricators having
already filled most of their needs ahead of the summertime
construction season.
   Analysts said further selling was prompted by speculation that a
five-week strike against the Southern Peru Copper Corp. may be
nearing a settlement after workers at a state-owned Peruvian copper
mine returned to work this past week. Both strikes began on March
12.
   ``People are thinking, `How long can these guys stay out when
this other group went back to work,''' said Steve Platt, a metals
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Gold futures edged lower on the Commodity Exchange while silver
futures advanced moderately.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with April at $376.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.7 cents higher with May at
$5.108 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, coffee futures
were boosted by trade buying amid reports of cooler weather moving
toward Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.
   Coffee settled 1.57 cents to 2.44 cents higher with May at 95.61
cents a pound.
   Oil futures had a mixed day on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
reflecting uncertainty about what action the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries might take to prop up prices at its
May 2 emergency meeting.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents lower to 4
cents higher with May at $17.95 a barrel; heating oil was .59 cent
lower to .14 cent higher with May at 52.94 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .32 cent higher with May at 61.93 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed ahead of three
Agriculture Department reports that were interpreted as neutral to
bearish for cattle futures and bullish for pork bellies.
   The USDA's monthly and quarterly cattle-on-feed reports showed a
larger-than-expected number of cattle placed on feedlots in the
first quarter, which traders initally perceived as bearish for
cattle futures.
   But analysts noted the June live cattle futures contract is
already trading nearly 7 cents below the cash market, indicating
the futures market has discounted the likelihood of greater
supplies this summer.
   ``I would say you're going to get a negative response to the
report on balance ... but I think that if the market drops 50 or 75
points, there will be a lot of support to buy the futures,'' said
Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   In its monthly cold-storage report, the USDA's tally of pork
bellies in the nation's commercial freezers was below market
expectations.
   The April live cattle cattle contract expired at noon at 80
cents a pound; the April hog contract expired at 57.30 cents a
pound.
   Other live cattle futures finished .13 cent to .33 cent higher
with June at 73.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with April at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs
were .35 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at 61.20 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to .90 cent higher
with May at 62.32 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose moderately in a technically inspired rally
on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures ended narrowly
mixed.
   Wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with May at $3.70} a
bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.77\
a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with May at
$1.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 5{ cents higher with May
at $6.04} a bushel.

   Phil Bakes resigned Friday as president and chief
executive officer of Eastern Airlines, as a court-appointed trustee
replaced parent Texas Air Corp. as head of the airline.
   Bakes, a long-time cohort of Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
urged Eastern employees to support trustee Martin Shugrue, who was
appointed Wednesday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   The judge appointed Shugrue over the opposition of Eastern and
Texas Air after the airline's unsecured creditors argued that
present management appeared unable to halt the company's financial
deterioration.
   ``I know you will give Marty the complete support and commitment
you afforded me. I have been privileged and inspired to be
associated with you,'' said Bakes in a statement issued to
Eastern's employees.
   ``The last 12 months, in particular, have been the most
satisfying of my life because of your accomplishments. I am
confident you will continue to succeed,'' Bakes said.
   Eastern has lost $1.2 billion since Machinists, pilots and
flight attendants walked off their jobs in March 1989, prompting
the airline to seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code.
   Lorenzo has denied reports that he had offered Bakes'
resignation to creditors this past week in exchange for withdrawing
their request for a trustee.
   Bakes' announcement came hours after Shugrue met Friday morning
with Eastern's officers. Company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said
Bakes' resignation was freely offered and was not part of a deal
with creditors.
   Ms. Ceremsak said no other resignations were expected.
   Bakes joined Texas Air in 1980 and became president of Eastern's
sister carrier, non-union Continental Airlines, before leaving to
run Eastern in October 1986.
   Under Bakes, Eastern suffered continued financial losses _
including $852.3 million in 1989 _ and labor turmoil culminating in
the strike and bankruptcy filing.
   During bankruptcy court hearings this past week, Bakes warned
that the appointment of a trustee could make it tougher for Eastern
to improve its business, by further shaking the confidence of
consumers and travel agents. He also warned that such a move could
spark departures by members of Eastern management, causing
additional problems.
   Shugrue also has had close ties to Texas Air, serving as
president of Continental until Lorenzo pressured him to resign in
February 1989. Before that, he had been a high-ranking executive at
Pan Am Corp.

<HEAD>Shugrue Faces Challenge in Piloting Eastern</HEAD>

   Martin Shugrue is a rare bird in the airline
industry: an executive who started as a pilot.
   As the new trustee for Eastern Airlines, he faces a challenge in
trying to pilot the carrier out of its financial tailspin.
   Shugrue picks up many of the problems that saddled Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., who was
stripped of his control over Eastern by a federal bankruptcy judge
on Wednesday.
   Shugrue must find ways to drum up more revenue, restore consumer
confidence in the airline and hammer out new labor contracts with
pilots, flight attendants and still-striking Machinists.
   The task was complicated by the resignation Friday of Phil
Bakes, Eastern's president and chief executive and the company's
top officer after Lorenzo.
   ``He's going to be under tremendous pressure to show progress
very quickly,'' Raymond Neidl, an analyst at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.,
said Friday. ``He's probably got one of the toughest jobs in the
airline business right now.''
   Eastern's unsecured creditors succeeded in persuading the
bankruptcy judge, Burton R. Lifland, to take the drastic step of
appointing a trustee. But the creditors, who are owed around $980
million, also could become impatient with Shugrue very quickly,
Neidl said.
   Shugrue, 49, moved quickly Friday to soothe jangled nerves. In a
meeting at Eastern's Miami headquarters, he told top executives
``this trustee is not a liquidator,'' according to Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell, who attended the session.
   In the course of the four-day hearing in bankruptcy court,
Eastern officials had warned that appointment of a trustee would
spark the resignations of top managers and eventually lead to the
airline's liquidation.
   Shortly after Shugrue met with the executives, Eastern announced
the resignation of Bakes, its president and chief executive since
October 1986. Before being relieved of control, Lorenzo had served
as Eastern's chairman.
   Jose Smith, Eastern's senior vice president of operations,
resigned earlier in the week.
   In an era when aviators have long since been replaced by
businessmen in most airline boardrooms, Shugrue knows the business
from the ground up. He worked his way through the ranks at Pan Am
Corp., starting as a pilot in 1968 and becoming vice chairman in
1984.
   He added the title of chief operating officer a year later. At
financially troubled Pan Am, as No. 2 to then-chairman C. Edward
Acker, Shugrue developed a reputation for efficiency, fairness and
good relations with labor.
   ``He was the bridge between top-level management and the
workers,'' said William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters'
airline division and a long-time adversary of Pan Am's management.
``He never beat up on the workers.''
   Shugrue and Acker clashed in late 1987 over a proposed merger of
Pan American World Airways, the company's main airline business,
with Braniff Inc. Shugrue had favored keeping Pan Am intact, while
Acker had pushed for a deal with Braniff, now reorganizing under
bankruptcy court protection.
   The two were ousted in a management shuffle at Pan Am in January
1988. A few months later, Lorenzo hired Shugrue as president of
Continental Airlines, Eastern's non-union sister carrier.
   Shugrue resigned under pressure in February 1989, after Lorenzo
brought in former TWA executive Joseph Corr over Shugrue as
Continental's chairman and chief executive. Shugrue became
Continental's sixth former president in as many years.
   ``Marty is an able airline operator,'' Lorenzo said Thursday in
an interview. ``And he's going to have our support.''
   So far, at least, Shugrue also seems to have the support of
Eastern's unions, who bitterly fought Lorenzo. Officials of the
Machinists union indicated Thursday they could negotiate a
back-to-work pact with deep concessions.
   Eastern also must reach long-term contract agreements with its
pilots and flight attendants.

<HEAD>Task Force Offers Anti-Money Laundering Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recommendations designed to establish
worldwide controls against laundering of hundreds of billions of
dollars by drug dealers were announced Thursday by an international
task force.
   The 40 ``action recommendations ... should establish a network
of comprehensive programs to address money laundering and will
facilitate greater cooperation in international investigations,
prosecutions and property seizures,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary
John E. Robson told reporters.
   The recommendations were adopted by the Financial Action Task
Force on Money Laundering last Feb. 7 in Paris and announced
simultaneously Thursday by the participating nations. Robson headed
the U.S. delegation on the panel.
   The task force was established following last summer's economic
summit of the Group of Seven nations in Paris to assess current
anti-money laundering efforts and ``to consider additional
preventive efforts in this field.''
   In addition to the G-7 nations of Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, other task force
members included Austria, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and the European
Community.
   Robson said the recommendations will be on the agenda at the
July meeting of the G-7 nations that President Bush will host
Houston.
   The task force report noted that the United Nations estimated
drug trafficking proceeds worldwide at $300 billion in 1987. Money
traffickers use a complex web of financial transactions to hide the
money in their accounts.
   ``The Financial Action Task Force was born of the ideas that
narcotics trafficking and money laundering are inextricably
connected and that money laundering is an international problem
that requires an international solution,'' Robson said.
   ``Countries must link together to have strong domestic
anti-money laundering programs for detection and prosecution and
must cooperate freely with each other in the many cases that cross
international borders,'' he said.
   Central to the recommendations is that financial institutions
must be the first line of defense by reporting suspicious dealings
by their customers, Robson said.
   ``Specifically, the Task force recommends that, as in the United
States, financial institutions must be able to report suspicious
transactions to law enforcement, in good faith, free from fear of
liability under secrecy laws,'' he said.
   ``Suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be vary
valuable to U.S. law enforcement,'' he added.
   Robson said other recommendations include requirements that
financial institutions have procedures to identify their customers
and maintain adequate records about customers and their
transactions.
   ``In most cases, current U.S. laws and regulations are in
conformance with the recommendations,'' Robson said.
   Robson said the announcement of the recommendations was the
``starting point of missionary efforts'' to attract support
throughout the international community.

   The stock market suffered another broad setback
Friday in selling attributed to inflation and interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.99 to
2,695.95, closing out the week with a 55.85-point loss.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
401 up, 1,079 down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.26 million
shares, against 152.93 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 205.96 million shares.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was dampened by renewed
upward pressure on interest rates over the past several days.
   Fears have been increasing in the financial world that the
increase in rates might hurt chances for a recovery in corporate
earnings later in the year.
   In the credit markets Friday, prices of long-term government
bonds fell about $10 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing
their yields to the 8.94 percent-8.99 percent range.
   Treasury-bond yields have climbed this week to their highest
levels since last May, propelled in part by inflation statistics
that many economists have described as worrisome.
   Brokers said traders also were unsettled by the news late
Thursday that Moody's Investors Service was reviewing its ratings
of some of the debt of Citicorp. Such a move would come as a fresh
setback to the trouble-plagued U.S. banking industry.
   Citicorp shares fell { to 23&rsqb; in active trading.
   Among stocks of other prominent money-center bank holding
companies, Chase Manhattan dropped | to 27; Manufacturers Hanover
1&rsqb; to 32; Chemical Banking | to 23\, and J.P. Morgan &rsqb; to 33|.
   Losers in the blue-chip industrial sector included DuPont, down

   On the plus side, International Business Machines rose \ to 109&rsqb;
and Exxon was up &rsqb; at 46&rsqb;.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich led the active list, down \ at 4. The
stock rose sharply in the two previous sessions on takeover rumors
and speculation that hadn't been borne out by the time the market
closed for the week.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $28.42 billion, or 0.88
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.51 to 184.06.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.84 to 389.90, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.97 at 335.12.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Co. in $42 Million Fight Over Clothing Line</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Swiss apparel maker charged in a $42 million
countersuit Friday that The Coca-Cola Co. lured it into a dead-end
deal to manufacture a line of clothing with the famous Coke logo.
   The countersuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta,
alleges that Coke withheld information that the market for the
clothing had gone flat because of a fiasco involving a previous
licensee.
   Spira Textile Investments SA also contends that actions by the
soft drink maker have prevented it from making deadlines for the
spring and summer season for the Coke clothing line, which helped
spark the late-1980's fad of corporate logo attire.
   A Coca-Cola spokesman branded the allegations in the countersuit
``laughable.''
   STI's countersuit is in response to a federal suit filed in
February by Coca-Cola charging breach of contract by the clothing
maker. Last October, Coke nullified its licensing agreement with
Spira.
   Coke has accused the Porrentrury, Switzerland, company and two
co-defendants of defaulting on $1 million in licensing fee payments
and failing to provide the soft drink maker with certain financial
reports.
   The $1 million represented the first of several payments that
were to total $10 million and serve as the non-refundable portion
of a $23 million licensing fee that would have given STI the right
to make, market and sell Coca-Cola clothing through 1993, according
to the Coke suit.
   Coke said in its suit it ``has reason to believe ... that
defendant STI will not pay the remaining $9 million of the
non-refundable licensing fee due during 1990.''
   STI admits in its countersuit that it has failed to pay
Coca-Cola the licensing fees, but paints itself as the victim of a
dupe whereby Coke used the company in an attempt to recover losses
from a failed deal with Murjani International Ltd., which made the
clothing line from 1984 until last year.
   Murjani's initial success with its line of sweatshirts,
sportswear and children's clothes emblazoned with the Coca-Cola
logo spawned an outpouring of garments by other manufacturers
featuring the insignias of some of America's best-known consumer
products.
   But Coke's relationship with Murjani soured, and the licensing
agreement was terminated last summer.
   Murjani also mass merchandised low-priced inferior goods ``that
left a negative impression of (Coke) apparel within conventional
trade channels,'' STI said.
   STI contends in its countersuit that Coke never informed the
company of the extent of the problems with Murjani.
   ``The Murjani relationship turned out to be a very bad
experience for Coca-Cola, financially and otherwise,'' said STI
attorney John R. Lowery. ``They were looking to find someone to
step into that bad situation.''
   Coca-Cola spokesman Mark Preisinger said STI's allegations
contained ``such wanton disregard for the facts as to be laughable.
The countersuit is without merit.''
   The countersuit said alhough Coca-Cola originally suggested that
STI replace Murjani as the clothing licensee, Coke later refused to
publicize its new agreement with Spira, ``apparently in order to
stem the flow of negative publicity from the Murjani situation.''
   Coke also blocked the clothing manufacturer's attempts to
arrange distribution arrangements with stores such as J.C. Penney,
Sears, K mart and Montgomery Ward, the countersuit said.
   Spira contends that Coke has caused the company to lose $7
million in business, which the countersuit seeks in damages along
with $35 million in punitive damages and attorneys fees.

   Lotus Development Corp., one of the
nation's largest computer software companies, reported Thursday a
sharp increase in earnings in the first quarter as the company
rebounded from product delays last year.
   Lotus, which recently announced plans to merge with Novell Inc.,
a Provo, Utah, computer products company, said net income totaled
$22.8 million, or 53 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31,
compared with $5.3 million, or 13 cents a share, in the same
quarter last year.
   Earnings were depressed in 1989's first quarter when Lotus
delayed releasing a new version of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet program,
its mainstay product.
   Sales in the first quarter rose 38 percent to $165.5 million
from $120 million last year.
   Company officials said Lotus has seen particularly strong demand
in Japan, and 50.7 percent of its revenue during the quarter came
from abroad _ the first time international revenue outpaced
domestic revenue.

   Kellogg Co. is aiming at breakfast
tables as far off as the Soviet Union and offering new products at
home to regain market share competitors have chewed away, the
world's largest cereal maker said Friday.
   Kellogg reported its first-quarter profit dropped 39.6 percent
from first-quarter 1989 earnings that were boosted by a tax
accounting change.
   Spending to research, develop and market new products caused
part of the decline, William E. LaMothe, chairman and chief
executive, said at the annual shareholders' meeting.
   Kellogg has introduced four new products in the past eight
months, trying to rebuild the market lead that analysts said
narrowed as the company lagged in meeting demand for oat bran
products last year.
   LaMothe said the company also may be nearing a decision in talks
it has carried on for two years on a possible cereal-making venture
in the Soviet Union.
   If the project moves forward, it would take about two years to
build a plant to manufacture ready-to-eat cereal from Soviet grain
for sale in the Soviet Union, he said.
   He also said Kellogg's plant in Bremen, West Germany, has
capacity to produce cereal for sale in East Germany should that
market open up soon.
   Kellogg currently makes cereal in 16 countries and sells it in
130.
   Last year, the company reported its first annual earnings
decline in 37 years as its 1989 profit fell 2.1 percent to $470.2
million.
   Kellogg said first-quarter 1990 profits dropped to $96.3
million, or 79 cents a share, from $159.5 million, or $1.30 a
share, in January-March 1989.
   Without an income-tax accounting change, first quarter 1989
earnings would have been $111.4 million, or 91 cents a share, and
1990 first-quarter profits were down 13.6 percent from that figure,
the company said.
   Net sales for the quarter were $1.21 billion, up 6.6 percent
from $1.13 billion a year earlier, the company said.
   ``Although first-quarter earnings declined, our overall results
are in line with our long-term plan to enhance our market position
in the United States and achieve consistent worldwide business
growth,'' Lamothe said.

   Bond prices fell sharply Friday amid concern
about a wider-than-expected federal budget deficit and a regional
report that showed the economy improving.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell a full point, or $10
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
rose to 8.94 percent from 8.84 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices rose slightly after the day's trading began, but
were sent lower by the release of a survey of companies in the
Philadelphia region that showed economic activity picking up, said
Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Government Securities Inc.
   Reports of an improving economy tend to hurt bond prices due to
concern that the Federal Reserve will not see a need to ease
interest rates.
   Later, the government said the budget deficit for March totaled
a record $53.3 billion, up to $13 billion higher than Wall Street
expected, Ricchiuto said.
   A larger deficit causes concern in the bond market that the
goverment might have to sell additional issues to meet the
shortfall. Increased bond supply can depress prices temporarily.
   Ricchiuto said the market already was concerned about upcoming
supply issues, including the May Treasury refunding auction.
   Traders said the price drops Friday were exacerbated by the
relatively light trading volume. It was the sixth session in a row
bond prices fell, largely due to concerns about upcoming supply and
inflation. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-return securities
such as bonds.
   The market also has been shaken by reports that Japanese
investors were selling their U.S. government bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell from 1-16 point to 7-32 point, intermediate
maturities lost between 11-32 point and 19-32 point, and long-term
issues were off from 15-16 point to 1 point, according to Telerate

   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.52 to 1,134.46.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 5-32 point to 90 20-32 point. The
average yield to maturity rose to 7.59 percent from 7.58 percent
late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.94 percent as the
discount fell 6 basis points to 7.69 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.22 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points
to 7.80 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.42 percent as
the discount dropped 1 basis point to 7.83 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8
15-16 percent late Thursday.

   Schering-Plough Corp. posted a 20 percent
increase in its first quarter profit on Thursday, citing stronger
showings by its worldwide pharmaceutical businesses.
   Net income increased to $150.4 million, or $1.33 per share,
compared with $125.7 million, or $1.12 per share, during the same
period in 1989, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement.
   First quarter sales rose 4 percent to $865.1 million, compared
with $831.8 million last year. However, sales were reduced by the
1989 divestitures of Schering-Plough's European cosmetics business
and a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate.
   Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer, said
sales by the company's worldwide pharmaceutical businesses rose 14
percent.

   Hasbro Inc. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings rose 3.7 percent on a 4.4 percent sales
increase and a strong international performance.
   The toymaker reported a profit of $19.4 million, or 33 cents per
share, for the period through April 1, up from $18.7 million, or 32
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose to $301.1 million from $288.3 million for the three
months.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company had a very strong quarter internationally.
   ``While virtually all our European units reported increases in
both revenues and earnings, Germany, Italy and Spain showed
exceptional growth,'' he said.
   Hasbro was helped in its international sales by favorable
exchange rates on foreign currency. Even excluding the exchange
rate effect, the growth was better than expected, Hassenfeld said.
   The company did not break out the results of its foreign
operations from its overall financial report.
   Domestically, Hasbro reported that the greatest strength was in
its Playskool division, which ``continued to show strength in the
preschool market with increased revenues and earnings.''
   The games and puzzles produced by the Milton Bradley division of
the company also performed well, but Hasbro Toy ``experienced mixed
results.
   The company did not disclose the specific financial figures for
each individual division.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Stop to Norton Takeover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts lawmakers, in a show of unity,
urged the Bush administration Thursday to block a hostile takeover
of Norton Co. of Worcester, Mass., a maker of industrial abrasives.
   Arguing that Norton is the leader in a field with defense and
national security applications, all 13 members of the state's
congressional delegation attended a news conference at the Capitol
calling for federal action against the proposed takeover by Great
Britain's BTR PLC.
   ``Norton is Worcester,'' said U.S. Rep. Joseph Early, D-Mass.
``Norton is the world's leading manufacturer of abrasives and the
largest employer in Worcester.''
   The 3,100 Norton employees would see their jobs jeopardized,
Early said, if a foreign owner decided to relocate or sell off
Norton's assets, such as plant equipment and patents.
   The delegation members signed a joint letter to President Bush
urging him to step in and block the takeover. Early said the
delegation would unveil legislation next week designed to make it
easier for the president to stop bid.
   A law already on the books allows the president, following an
investigation, to block a foreign takeover if it would threaten
national security. But it has only been invoked once.
   A BTR spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the
existing law is ``inapplicable'' to BTR.
   ``BTR and its subsidiaries in the U.S. have sensitive and
secretive clearance with the Department of Defense and other
federal government agencies,'' the spokesman said. ``We believe
those clearances are more sensitive than Norton's.''
   The BTR spokesman added that BTR has no plans to move the Norton
headquarters or lay off workers.
   The stance taken by the congressional delegation came a day
after Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a law that would prevent BTR
from wresting immediate control over the Norton board.
   The law requires Massachusetts companies to elect directors over
staggered terms, with one-third being elected at a time. That would
prevent BTR from replacing a majority of directors at the Norton
annual meeting, scheduled for next Thursday.
   Norton tried to delay the meeting for two months, but that move
was blocked this week by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   Norton also has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that
state law prohibits BTR from exercising any voting power at
Norton's shareholders meeting. BTR called Norton's claim
``frivolous.''
   A key player in the effort to involve President Bush in the
Norton battle is likely to be U.S. Rep. Silvio Conte, the only
Republican in the delegation and the most senior member from
Massachusetts.
   ``When a foreign company attempts to acquire an American company
that has important industrial and technological capabilities, the
president is required to determine if the acquisition is in the
best interests of our national security,'' Conte said. ``Norton's
research projects, manufacturing technologies and government
contracts are of great importance to our national security and our
industrial base.''

<TEXT>
   Oil futures finished mostly lower Friday as the
dramatic rebound that started a day earlier on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ran its course.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 11 cents per 42-gallon
barrel to settle at $17.95. On Thursday, the contract jumped $1.10
to $18.06.
   The May contract expired Friday. Most other contract months
showed smaller declines.
   Crude prices rallied Thursday after word spread that a special
session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
eight-member monitoring panel would meet May 2 in Geneva,
Switzerland.
   The market was anticipating cutbacks in OPEC's overproduction,
analysts said.
   Oil analysts estimate the 13-nation cartel is pumping more than
24 million barrels of crude a day, well over its ceiling of 22.1
million barrels a day for the first half of the year.
   Chris Gohler, an analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said the rally
continued into Friday morning but later tapered off as the effects
of the OPEC news faded.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange were mixed.
   The contract for May delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
rose 0.15 cent to settle at 61.93 cents a gallon. Other contract
months posted larger gains, with the June contract advancing 0.32
cent to 60.93.
   Wholesale home heating oil for May delivery rose 0.14 cent to
52.94 cents a gallon. Other contract months declined, however. The
June contract dropped 0.51 cent to 50.88 cents.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery finished at $1.543 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.570 on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bank Takes $5 Million Writedown Due to International Swindle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seattle-First National Bank had to write off $5
million against first-quarter earnings because of an international
swindle in which $14.5 million in phony U.S. Treasury checks were
cashed at one of its branches, officials said.
   A federal grand jury in Seattle handed up a 29-count superseding
indictment Thursday, charging two Canadians and an Oregon
businessman in the case.
   If convicted on all 29 counts, each man could face up to 510
years in jail and fines of more than $12 million.
   Seafirst accepted eight checks at its Vancouver, Wash., branch
on two days in February, said Stan Carlson, Seafirst's general
counsel.
   Seafirst, Washington state's biggest bank and a subsidiary of
BankAmerica Corp., said it set up a $5 million reserve to cover
possible losses from the checks.
   Seafirst Chairman Richard Cooley said the charge was the biggest
factor in a 12.7 percent drop in the bank's first-quarter profit to
$24.9 million.
   The indictment charges Harvey To-Kong Wong, 41, Siu-San Lam, 30,
both of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Michael C. Busher, 38, of
West Linn, Ore., U.S. Attorney Mike McKay said.
   The defendants are charged with conspiracy to deliver and to
pass counterfeit U.S. Treasury checks and with money laundering,
McKay said.
   Some of the proceeds from the checks were transferred to banks
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and Oregon, McKay said.
   The indictment supersedes a five-count indictment against Wong
and Lam returned March 15.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Profit Up 1 Percent; PNC Profit Down 39.7 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp. said Thursday its first-quarter profit edged
higher while PNC Financial Corp., another major banking company,
posted a 39.7 percent profit decline due to provisions for possible
loan losses.
   BankAmerica, the San Francisco-based parent of Bank of America,
earned $278 million in the three months ended March 31, up 1
percent from $275 million in 1989's first quarter.
   The company noted that during the quarter it received no
interest payments on loans to Brazil, which has enacted a severe
economic austerity plan to cool inflation, while Brazilian interest
increased net income in the year-earlier period by $38 million.
   Earnings per share fell to $1.23 in this year's first quarter
from $1.38 a year earlier. The number of common shares outstanding
increased 12 percent over the year.
   ``First-quarter earnings demonstrate continuing success in
managing the fundamental areas of our business, producing growth in
the volumes of deposits and loan originations, as well as
continuing strong credit performance,'' said Chairman A.W. Clausen.
   Pittsburgh-based PNC said its net income dropped to $74.5
million, or 77 cents per share, from $123.6 million, or $1.29 per
share, in the first quarter of 1989.
   The drop reflected a $108.9 million provision for possible
credit losses, taken in recognition of continuing softness in
regional real estate markets and the slowing national economy, PNC
said.
   About $36.4 million was set aside for possible loan losses in
the same quarter of 1989.
   ``Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our
fundamental business which enables us to take appropriate action
when necessary to deal with cyclical economic problems,'' PNC
Chairman Thomas O'Brien said.
   ``Recognizing the current operating environment, 1990 will
continue to be a very challenging year for PNC and the entire
banking industry,'' he said.
   As of March 31, PNC's total nonperforming assets totaled $831.6
million, up from $581.3 million as of Dec. 31.
   PNC blamed the increase on softening real estate markets,
changing economic conditions and the results of a recent regulatory
examination of an affiliate bank. Management applied similar
examination criteria throughout the company.
   PNC operates 529 community banking offices in Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Delaware and New Jersey.

<HEAD>Upjohn To Pay $1.8 Million To Settle Water Pollution Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Upjohn Co. has agreed to pay $1.8
million to settle a federal lawsuit stemming from more than 1,000
waste water discharge permit violations at the company's North
Haven fine chemicals plant, two environmental groups announced
Thursday.
   Upjohn will contribute just over $1.2 million to the New Haven
Foundation to establish a trust fund for projects beneficial to the
Quinnipiac River, New Haven Harbor and their watersheds, the groups
said.
   The remainder of the settlement will be used to cover the legal
costs incurred by the Connecticut Fund for the Environment and the
Natural Resources Defense Council, said Kate Robinson, senior staff
attorney for CFE.
   Robinson said she believed it was the largest pollution penalty
ever paid for permit violations in Connecticut.
   The two environmental groups sued Upjohn in 1985 under a
citizens suit provision of the Federal Clean Water Act for
exceeding limits on the toxic materials it could discharge into the
Quinnipiac River.
   A federal judge in Hartford ruled in 1987 that Upjohn was liable
for more than 1,000 permit violations, and a hearing to determine
the fine was held in late December and early January. A settlement
was reached then, but details had to be worked out, Robinson said.
   By settling the case, the environmental groups were able to make
sure the money paid by Upjohn is used to help clean up the
Quinnipiac, Robinson said.
   Had the court imposed a penalty, the money would have gone to
the federal treasury, she said.
   Upjohn had argued that it had done all that was possible to
treat its industrial waste, and that it viewed permit standards
established in 1983 as goals and not enforceable limits.
   ``We regret the misunderstanding which followed our installation
of what was, at the time, the best available technology to control
our waste water discharges,'' Pete Mass, a spokesman at Upjohn's
Kalamazoo, Mich., headquarters, said Thursday.
   On the settlement, he said: ``We are pleased that this is not
only finished but that most of the proceeds will be used for such a
worthy cause as improving the Quinnipiac River.''
   Upjohn announced in December its plan to phase out operations at
the North Haven plant over three years.

   Chrysler Corp. agreed to recall about 72,000
vehicles from the 1983 model year that fail to meet federal
emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency announced.
   Affected models are the 2.2-liter Plymouth Horizon, Turismo and
Reliant; the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries, 600ES and 400; and
Chrysler LeBaron. Only vehicles with manual transmissions are
involved, and California vehicles are excluded, the EPA said in a
statement released Thursday in Washington, D.C.
   In another automotive notice, Ford Motor Co. issued a voluntary
recall of 268 Korean-made 1990 Festivas, citing faulty circuit
boards that could keep some seat-belt, engine oil-pressure and
battery-charging warning lights from working properly in cold
temperatures.
   ``Those 268 cars got out before we caught the problem,'' Ford
spokesman Jim Trainor said Thursday. ``We notified the customers as
soon as we had the parts in to fix the problem.''
   No injuries have been reported because of the problem, which
dealers will fix at no cost to the owners, he said.
   The EPA said the Chrysler emissions failure involved carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons and was first detected in an agency test.
   Chrysler said it will install an air-bleed assembly to provide
additional air to the intake manifold, and the ignition timing and
idle speed will be reset. The repair will take about 30 minutes and
will be free of charge.

<TEXT>
   Norton Co., fighting a hostile $1.6 billion
takeover bid, disclosed Friday it had received a better buyout
offer but did not accept the proposal because the company was
trying to line up investors who would buy a minority stake in the
company.
   Norton's disclosure, in documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, came less than a week before the company's
annual meeting. BTR PLC, a British conglomerate, plans to wage a
proxy fight at the meeting to place its own directors on the Norton
board.
   Norton last month rejected a $75-per-share offer from BTR, and
in the meantime Norton has been looking for other investors.
   In the federal documents, Norton said one party that it did not
identify indicated it was interested in acquiring the company at a
higher price.
   But Norton continued: ``No negotiation of such transaction has
taken place.'' Norton said it advised the suitor that the company
is continuing to look for investors who would buy a minority
interest.
   Other third parties also have shown interest in buying some of
Norton's business units, but no decision has been made, the company
said.
   ``We find Norton's announcement today encouraging because maybe
it will cause the Norton board to begin focusing on shareholder
value,'' BTR said in a statement.
   It said the announcement ``makes the proxy contest that we are
undertaking that much more critical to shareholders who want to
maximize the value of their investment.''
   Analysts said the disclosure added confusion to the takeover
battle as the two sides prepare for next Thursday's annual meeting
in Worcester.
   One of Norton's biggest weapons is a new state law that would
prevent BTR from taking immediate control over the Norton board.
But analysts said Friday that this legislation could also bring a
year of hardship for the company, a leading maker of abrasives.
   The law zoomed through the Legislature this week and was signed
by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, taking immediate effect. It permits a
Massachusetts corporation to elect only one-third of its directors
at a time, unless the company opts out of the requirement.
   BTR says it will not back down, despite the state law, which
creates a likely scenario that the Norton board will have a
minority bloc of dissident directors for at least a year.
   ``It's going to be a hell of a first meeting,'' said John Lubin,
a professor of management at The Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania.
   ``Suddenly, you bring in a whole bunch of guys who are against
you. It's going to be difficult,'' he said.
   Norton representatives concede that one-third of the company's
directors probably will be voted out at the meeting. So while the
Norton board would retain its majority and have a year to plan its
options, the dissident directors would sit in on the discussions
and gain insight to the strategy, analysts said. They also would
have more opportunities to persuade the majority toward BTR's
position.
   ``Basically, the question is are those people going to get
together and do what's best for the shareholders, or get themselves
in a political donnybrook and have a standoff for a year,'' said
Jay Lorsch, a Harvard Business School professor.
   ``If things become polarized, it's going to be a very difficult
year,'' he said. ``I don't think it bodes well for anybody.''
   Since the directors are liable for their decisions, the minority
bloc can challenge the majority's actions, using a threat of
shareholder lawsuits, observers said.
   In fact, a flurry of lawsuits would be expected if the majority
directors took any more steps to protect Norton from the takeover.
   ``I don't think anybody will win except the lawyers,'' said Eli
Lustgarten, an analyst at Paine Webbe. ``It's not a pleasant
situation.''
   A source close to Norton, who asked not to be named, said the
board is aware of the potential difficulties but is determined to
fight BTR.
   ``The real question is who cracks first,'' the source said.
   The bickering between the directors also could harm the
company's long-term performance, Lubin said.
   ``The good boards work together,'' he said. ``The board of
directors should be trying to help the company move forward
strategically.''
   ``It's obvious there would be a temporary instability,'' he
said. ``I think there's a danger Norton will drift.''
   One uncertainty about next week's meeting was a lawsuit filed by
Norton that claims a mechanism in state law prevents BTR from
exercising any voting power. BTR said the claim was meritless, and
the suit has been considered a long shot.

   Strong sales in foreign markets
contributed to 5.3 percent profit growth at 3M Co. in the first
quarter, the diversified manufacturer said Thursday.
   Net income was $335 million, or $1.51 a share, compared with
$318 million, or $1.43 a share, in the first period a year ago.
Sales totaled $3.16 billion, up 4.9 percent from $3.02 billion in
the 1989 first quarter.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
3M's international unit volume rose 12 percent from the same
quarter last year. International markets accounted for 49 percent
of 3M sales during the quarter, Jacobson said.
   ``Our international operations are off to a strong start, and we
look for continued solid real growth abroad,'' he said. ``We also
look for somewhat better U.S. volume growth as the year progresses,
with most of this improvement coming in the second half.''
   Domestically, 3M's unit volume increased about 1 percent in the
first three months of 1990, he said. Sales were slowed in the
sector serving automotive, housing, general industrial and other
markets, Jacobson said.
   Telecommunications and medical products were among the domestic
sectors showing gains.

   David P. Friedley resigned Friday as
president and chief executive officer of Tektronix Inc., a
financially-troubled electronics manufacturer.
   Friedley, 50, had been with Tektronix for 14 years and had been
president since 1987. Before that, he was vice president and
general manager of the communications group.
   ``It was probably a joint decision,'' Tektronix spokeswoman
Jeanine Navarra said of Friedley's departure. ``As you know, our
results have not been good.''
   Tektronix has been involved in a major cost-cutting campaign and
announced a loss of almost $25.5 million, or 88 cents a share, for
the third quarter ended March 3 in contrast to a profit of $6.38
million, or 22 cents a share, in the previous year's third quarter.
   Robert W. Lundeen, chairman of the board, was named acting chief
executive officer. William D. Walker, a director, was named acting
president.
   Navarra said a search for a new president and chief executive
officer had begun.
   The company has reported that expenses associated with its
belt-tightening efforts, including severance pay to laid-off
employees, reduced earnings by $8.8 million in the most recent

   The Providence Journal Co. said Friday it
will sell its cellular telephone business to GTE Corp. for $710
million and use the money to improve and expand its media
operations.
   GTE will acquire the systems in North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia and Virginia, expanding its potential customer base by 3.5
million to more than 26 million, the Stamford-based
telecommunications company said.
   The Journal Co., based in Providence, R.I., and owner of The
Providence Journal, The Evening Bulletin and The Providence Sunday
Journal, said the sale will allow the company to concentrate on its
media operations, which include four television stations and a
cable system in five states. It said it will use the funds to
acquire more papers and stations and expand the cable system.
   ``Some people like golf and others like tennis. Well, our area
of expertise and comfort is in the media. We like it and we want to
stay there,'' said Jack C. Clifford, vice president of the
company's broadcasting and cable operations.
   He said the company has been negotiating to buy a group of
weekly newspapers owned by DCI Publishing Inc. of Alexandria, Va.
He would not identify any television stations, saying negotiations
have not progressed to the point where he can discuss them.
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will allow
both GTE and the Journal Co. to concentrate on their core
businesses. GTE, which operates in 46 states and 41 countries, had
$17.4 billion in sales last year from its telecommunications,
lighting and precision materials companies.
   ``We've really in the last three years pulled into those three
core businesses,'' said spokesman Tony Hamilton. ``This is a
particularly good acquisition because it's an area where we do not
have any cellular right now and basically it's an area of
contiguous operations that will be fairly easy to manage.''
   The purchase will be GTE's largest since it bought US Sprint for
$750 million in 1983, he said.
   The Journal, which began publishing in 1820, entered the cable
business in 1969 and the television business in 1984. It now owns
WHAS-TV in Louisville, Ky., WCNC-TV in Charlotte, N.C., KMSB-TV in
Tucson, Ariz., and KGSW-TV in Albuquerque, N.M., and also operates
Colony Communications, the cable operation with 300,000 subscribers
in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, California and Florida.
   The company entered the cellular business in Raleigh, N.C., in
1985, its first non-media venture.
   ``We thought there was a lot of synergism with our cable
operations,'' Clifford said.
   ``But we're fundamentally a media company and with the
escalating values that were being promoted in cellular and our own
background in media, it just really wasn't our game,'' he said.
``Like every company, every individual, we chose to examine the
marketplace to see if we could convert a very valuable asset into
another very valuable asset that is more like what we want to do.''
   The Journal Co. announced in January it was looking for buyers,
and GTE was one of 10 companies that made serious offers, Clifford
said.
   The Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin have daily
circulation of about 200,000. The Sunday Journal has circulation of
about 300,000.

<HEAD>First Chicago Earnings Fall 45.7 Percent in 1st Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled real estate loans sent First Chicago
Corp.'s earnings tumbling 45 percent in the first quarter, the
banking company announced Friday.
   Net income for the first quarter of 1990 was $68.6 million, or
93 cents per share, down from $124.7 million, or $1.85 a share, a
year earlier.
   First Chicago said its results were hurt by an increase in the
loan loss provision due to troubled real estate loans.
   Its provision for the first quarter was $160 million compared
with $50 million a year earlier.
   The company also said its latest earnings included a pretax gain
of $52 million from the partial settlement of The First National
Bank of Chicago's pension obligations.
   ``We expect that the loan loss provision will return to normal
levels in future quarters and we are optimistic about our prospects
for the remainder of the year,'' said Barry F. Sullivan, First
Chicago chairman.
   On March 29, the bank announced troubled real estate loans would
cut its first-quarter earnings in half compared with last year's
first quarter.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Inc., the major
debt rating agencies, promptly reduced First Chicago's credit
rating.

   Former junk bond financier Michael Milken has
agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $600 million in
penalties to settle the largest securities fraud case in history.
   The plea bargain disclosed Friday by sources is a stunning
reversal for Milken and caps negotiations between the government
and attorneys for the ex-head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond department.
   Milken and Drexel were implicated by speculator Ivan Boesky, who
cooperated with the government in settling charges that he ran an
insider trading network. Boesky's disclosures implicated major
financial figures and shocked Wall Street in the 1980s.
   Milken is expected to enter the guilty plea to the felony counts
and agree to pay fines and restitution next week in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, said individuals close to the case, who asked
not to be named.

<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to buy a
19.5 percent stake in Six Flags Corp., which owns seven theme park
attractions, with an option to purchase up to half the company,
officials said Friday.
   Six Flags owners, Wesray Capital Corp. and Six Flags management,
will sell Time Warner the stake for $19.5 million.
   Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit has licensed Six Flags the use
of its Looney Tunes cartoon characters, such as Bugs Bunny, in its
parks since 1984.
   ``Closer ties with Time Warner present a broad array of fresh
opportunities, and will lead to expanded use of Warner cartoon
characters,'' said Larry Cochran, Six Flags chairman.
   The deal also gives Time Warner the option to increase its
investment up to 50 percent of the company for up to an additional
$30.5 million.
   Cochran said Time Warner subsidiaries will represent Six Flags
in corporate sponsorships and merchandising efforts.
   Six Flags owns or manages theme parks in Arlington, Houston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, Atlanta and St. Louis.
   The company's parks have annual attendance of about 17 million
people and revenue of some $400 million.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Confirms Northeast Utility Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy reorganization plan for
Public Service Company of New Hampshire was confirmed Friday in
federal court, two years after the state's largest utility filed
for bankruptcy protection.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos confirmed the $2.3 billion
Northeast Utilities takeover plan for Public Service a week after
confirmation hearings on the plan were completed.
   Northeast, based in Berlin, Conn., was one of four bidders,
including Public Service itself, for the utility. Public Service
was crippled by losses from the delayed Seabrook nuclear power
plant, in which it was a major investor, when it sought bankruptcy
court protection in January 1988.
   The takeover plan calling for seven annual 5.5 electricity rate
increases won the support of creditors, shareholders and the state
in November, beating out United Illuminating Co., of Connecticut
and New England Electric System of Massachusetts.
   The state Public Utilities Commission is holding hearings on the
complicated rate agreement this month.
   ``The rate agreement is fair, reasonable, consistent with public
policy and the public interest and is in the best interests of
creditors and equity security holders,'' Yacos said.
   Yacos' confirmation means Northeast can begin managing Public
Service on April 30 and until the acquisition formally is
completed, said Public Service spokesman Nick Ashooh.
   The takeover requires state and federal regulatory approvals,
which utility officials do not expect until the spring of 1991.
   Until then, an interim company run by Northeast and owned by
Public Service's creditors and stockholders will control the
utility.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Posts Profit Despite Drop In Many Segments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. posted a first-quarter
profit of $2 million Friday, as improved earnings in combat
aircraft helped offset a large loss in transport aircraft and lower
earnings in other segments.
   The profit compared with net income of $169 million in the
year-earlier period, although those results included a one-time tax
gain of $179 million. Without the gain, McDonnell Douglas would
have posted a $10 million loss.
   Earnings per share totaled 5 cents in the three months ended
March 31, compared with $4.43 in first quarter 1989. Revenue rose
to $3.8 billion from $3.2 billion.
   The St. Louis-based defense contractor said its combat aircraft
segment saw earnings rise sharply because of higher earnings rates
in the F-15 and FA-18 programs and because of lower development
costs in its Advanced Tactical Fighter program.
   Earnings in the combat aircraft division rose to $104 million
from $32 million during the same period last year.
   But this improvement was offset by a loss of $84 million in
transport aircraft, compared with a loss of $37 million during the
same period last year, and by lower earnings in the missiles, space
and electronic systems segment, the company said.
   The loss in transport aircraft stemmed primarily from higher
development costs for the MD-11 tri-jet entered a flight test and
certification program. There also were increased costs in other
programs, the company said, and the MD-80 program posted a loss.
   The missiles, space and electronic systems division showed
earnings of $13 million, down from $41 million a year earlier. The
company said the drop resulted from lower earnings rates in several
highly competitive missile programs. McDonnell Douglas carried out
three successful Delta II satellite launches during the period, the
company said.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis First Quarter Earnings Down; Bell Atlantic Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Pacific Telesis results.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis Group said increased expenses and a forced
California rate cut depressed its first quarter earnings by 14.5
percent. Bell Atlantic Corp. said broad-based growth boosted its
net by 7.4 percent.
   San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, the regional telephone
company for California and Nevada, said its earnings fell to $262
million, or 65 cents a share, from $317 million, or 76 cents a
share, in the first three months of 1989.
   Revenues rose 1.3 percent in the quarter to $2.37 billion from
$2.34 billion last year.
   The results reflected the impact of a $391 million annual rate
cut required under a new California regulatory framework that took
effect Jan. 1.
   ``We're seeing a decline in earnings just as we said, but the
good news is our business fundamentals are still very strong,''
said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer. He said the
company will continue to expand its cellular and cable operations.
   Expenses for the quarter rose 6.5 percent because of
contract-related labor costs, depreciation and increased
expenditures to improve the telephone network and internal
operation systems, the company said.
   In Philadelphia, Bell Atlantic said net income rose to $355.5
million in the first quarter from $330.8 million in the same period
of 1989.
   The company said the increase reflected strong volume in its
network services business, growth in non-telephone businesses and
the acquisition of Control Data Corp.'s third-party maintenance
business.
   Earnings amounted to 90 cents a share in the latest quarter, up
from 84 cents a year earlier, adjusted for a two-for-one stock
split effective April 10.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to $3.02 billion from $2.77 billion.
Operating expenses rose 8.3 percent to $2.36 billion from $2.18
billion.
   Bell Atlantic is the parent of New Jersey Bell, Bell of
Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone and the Chesapeake and
Potomac Telephone Companies.

<HEAD>SCEcorp Chief Blasts Van de Kamp for Opposing Utility Merger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   SCEcorp's chairman accused state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp of angling for votes by opposing
the company's proposed $2.5 billion buyout of San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric Co.
   The merger of San Diego Gas with SCEcorp's Southern California
Edison subsidiary would create the nation's largest investor-owned
utility, but it faces strong opposition in San Diego.
   Shareholders of both companies approved it a year ago and it is
now tied up in regulatory hearings. Edison maintains the merger
will produce $1.7 billion in savings to be passed on to customers
in the form of lower rates.
   Van de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
governor, has opposed the merger, claiming it would be
anti-competitive.
   At SCEcorp's annual meeting Thursday, a shareholder suggested
Van de Kamp's motives were political, causing Chairman Howard Allen
to erupt in anger.
   ``You said it, I didn't! But I agree with you 100 percent,''
said Allen.
   ``I'm just so disgusted with it. I thought he had a higher sense
of intellectual honesty and competence, and I'll tell you it really
infuriated me as you can tell.''
   So angry was Allen that another shareholder stepped up to the
microphone to chastise him.
   ``You have a duty to hold your temper back,'' the shareholder
said.
   Allen retorted: ``You're entitled to your opinion and I'm
entitled to mine and I thank you very much.''
   The merger is the subject of federal hearings under way in
Washington and also needs approval by the state Public Utilities
Commission, which has scheduled hearings later this year.
   Allen said he was confident the deal would be approved by the
end of the year. But he acknowledged opposition from some San Diego
residents fearful of losing a utility with local headquarters.
   The merger calls for SCEcorp to trade stock for SDG&amp;E rather
than pay cash. The combined company would have 4.8 million
customers.
   SCEcorp contends the merger will result in far lower rates for
utility users throughout its area. But the staff of the PUC has
opposed the merger, saying there is no guarantee rates would be
lower after 1993. Edison spokesmen have said they believe the deal
can be modified to placate those critics.
   SCEcorp also announced that first quarter profits rose 46
percent to $172 million, or 79 cents a share, from $118 million, or
54 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.56
billion from $1.53 billion.
   Allen said the higher profits were due almost entirely to a PUC
decision shifting some earnings to the first, second and fourth
quarters from the third quarter, without affecting annual earnings.

<HEAD>Mexico Opens Newsprint to Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has
made economic liberalization one of the hallmarks of his
administration, has opened up the newsprint monopoly to competition.
   Productora e Importadora de Papel, S.A., known as Pipsa, has had
the monopoly on newsprint production and importation since its
founding in 1935.
   By controlling the supply of newsprint and extending credit on
Pipsa bills, the government has been able to muzzle its enemies by
controlling the supply of newsprint and credit. The government has
at times withheld newsprint supplies from critics.
   But that control ends Friday when anybody can produce or import
newsprint.
   Salinas announced the change Thursday in remarks at a special
meeting of Pipsa's board of directors _ made up of newspaper
publishers _ at the presidential palace.
   The president said competition would make Pipsa more efficient
and fortify press freedom.
   ``A stronger Pipsa will strengthen our democracy,'' Salinas said.
   Although they now have the freedom to purchase newsprint from
other suppliers, publishers said they were unsure whether they
would switch right away.
   When Salinas proposed last year that Pipsa be liquidaded,
publishers howled in protest. Pipsa for many years allowed
cash-short buyers to pay when they were able, and the company was a
perennial money-loser.
   But last year, Pipsa turned around and made nearly $12 million
in profits.
   Mexico, which manufactured 400,000 tons of newsprint last year,
is the world's 11th-largest producer. But domestic production can't
keep up with demand; last year Mexican publishers bought 430,000
tons of newsprint.
   Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios said that after
turning a profit, ``Pipsa is an efficient and productive public
company which guarantees the existence of a free and pluralistic
press that Mexican society requires.''
   The head of Pipsa said Salinas' announcement ``opens the options
for newspapers.''
   Rene Villareal, the organization's director general, said he
didn't know whether newsprint prices would rise or fall.
   ``Like anything, the market will determine the prices,'' he said.
   Publishers enthusiastically supported the move.
   ``It's an excellent decision. It opens the possibilities to buy
on the free market. It will be very beneficial for all
publishers,'' said Benjamin Wong Castaneda, publisher of Punto.
   But Wong, like other publishers, said it was too soon to say
whether he would seek a new supplier.
