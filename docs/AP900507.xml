<HEAD>Hungary Denies Involvement in Selling Soviet Arms to U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deputy defense minister denied
Monday that Hungary was involved in selling advanced Soviet
military technology to the United States, as alleged in a published
report.
   The state MTI news agency said the newspaper Mai Nap quoted
Brig. Gen. Ferenc Szombathelyi as saying in an interview published
Monday, ``As far as Hungary is concerned, I am positive that the
Hungarian military authorities did nothing which could have
endangered our national integrity.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Gyoergy Keleti told MTI that
``Soviet military technological means and secrets could not have
been supplied ... from Hungary.''
   He said Hungary never had the most modern Soviet military
equipment, that the standard of military technology here lagged
behind the most up-to-date Soviet technology by up to 10 years, MTI
reported.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified ``intelligence
sources'' in Washington and abroad, said in Sunday's editions that
the United States secretly bought advanced Soviet military
technology from Romania for 10 years prior to the December
revolution that ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu was executed on Christmas Day.
   The newspaper said the Romanian connection was part of a larger
weapons-buying operation that allowed the U.S. military to obtain
important components of Soviet air defense systems.
   It quoted its sources as saying the United States paid more than
$250 million the past 10 years to obtain the latest versions of
Soviet-made weapons systems through contacts in other East bloc
countries, including Hungary.
   Asked if he considered the Washington Post article a ``mere
slander,'' Szombathelyi was quoted as replying, ``As far as Hungary
is concerned, it definitely is.''
   But he was quoted as adding that ``a thorough inquiry'' would be
launched into the matter and that a parliamentary inquiry was also
expected.
   Mai Nap said Szombathelyi responded, when asked how Moscow
counterintelligence could have been unaware of the reportedly
extensive operation: ``That is exactly why I consider these
allegations pure nonsense.''
   He was said to have added, however, that that ``everything is
possible in trade.''
   The Washington Post report said the democratization of Eastern
Europe had disrupted the broader operation, but not stopped it.

   A federal grand jury will investigate a
weekend clash in which Vietnamese immigrants and longtime Louisiana
shrimp fishermen exchanged gunfire and rammed each other's boats,
the FBI said Monday.
   ``We turned the results of our investigation over to the U.S.
Attorney. Those results will be presented to a grand jury and any
criminal charges that result will come out of that investigation,''
said FBI spokesman Volney Hayes.
   No injuries were reported in the Saturday gun battle at Whiskey
Pass, one of Louisiana's barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico
about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans.
   Six shrimp boats, some with bullet holes, were taken to the
small fishing community of Port Fourchon on Sunday, the Coast Guard
said. After crew members were questioned, the boats were released,
a spokesman for the Harbor Police said.
   Four Vietnamese fishermen were detained for their own safety but
no one was arrested, the Coast Guard said. They were interviewed by
federal agents Sunday at Grand Isle, then returned to their boat
Sunday afternoon.
   The Vietnamese fishermen would not discuss the incident with
reporters who gathered Sunday at Port Fourchon. Louisiana fishermen
said the Vietnamese shot first. The Coast Guard said the shooting
broke out after the anchor of the vessel Our Mama, manned by
longtime Louisiana fishermen, became entangled in the net of the
vessel Freedom I, manned by Vietnamese living in the United States.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Guerrilla Warns Against Superpower Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist Moslem guerrilla
leader threatened to fight against any superpower deal to end the
12-year-old struggle to oust Afghanistan's pro-Moscow government.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, firebrand leader of Hezb-i-Islami or Party
of Islam, has vowed to launch a jihad or ``holy war'' if a dealis
worked out at this month's U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington.
   The Afghan war is expected to figure prominently in talks
beginning May 30 between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The superpowers have agreed to prevent the formation of an
Islamic government in Afghanistan,'' said Abdul Qadir Karyab, who
heads Hekmatyar's politicial committee.
   ``We will not only continue our jihad on the battlefield, but we
also have other ways should the superpowers interfere in our
internal affairs,'' Karyab told The Associated Press.
   Western diplomats and Afghan experts in Islamabad have hinted
the superpowers are close to a deal, but decline to give any
specific details.
   The likeliest scenario, they said, was have elections in
Afghanistan run jointly by the United Nations and the Organization
of the Islamic Conference or by a neutral group chosen by the two
organizations.
   But they also warned it will be very difficult to find a
political solution acceptable to both the rebels and the Afghan
government.
   Afghan President Najibullah has refused to step down prior to
elections, a pre-condition set by even the most moderate guerrilla
groups headquartered in Pakistan's rugged frontier city of Peshawar.
   The guerrillas have come under increasing pressure, particularly
from the United States, to end their internal rivalries and devise
a political settlement to the war.
   But the seven guerrilla groups are deeply divided. The president
of the guerrilla's self-proclaimed government-in-exile,
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, has branded Hekmatyar a ``murderer'' and
accused him of killing more innocent Afghans than Soviet or Afghan
soldiers.
   Karyab said the Hezb-i-Islami would consider imposing its will
on the other guerrilla groups.
   ``If they can't agree with our reasonable proposals, we have our
unreasonable ways,'' he said refusing to elaborate.
   Hekmatyar is also feuding with Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of
the powerful Jamiat-i-Islami or Society of Islam. The two have
traded threats and accusations of murder, kidnapping and theft.
   Hekmatyar, who is strongly anti-Western, fought ferociously
against the Soviets and received the lion's share of U.S. military
assistance during the 12-year-old war.
   Karyab said Washington now fears Hekmatyar's strength in
Afghanistan.
   ``As far as I can see, the United States has very dangerous
plans, including certain activity, even terrorist acts against the
Hezb-i-Islami leader,'' Karyab said.
   The United States sends $500 million a year in aid to the
guerrillas while the Soviet Union gives an estimated $5 billion a
year to the Kabul government.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Location of Second Alzheimer's Disease Gene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say they may have found the
approximate location of a second defective gene that promotes
Alzheimer's disease, a possible step toward a treatment.
   The work, which follows a 1987 report of one such genetic
defect, ``sort of shines a flashlight on a new area'' to pursue,
said researcher Dr. Allen D. Roses of the Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C.
   The new work focused on a form of Alzheimer's that runs in
families and strikes at an average age of about 69, said Roses. The
genetic defect located earlier was associated with Alzheimer's that
strikes at a younger age.
   Alzheimer's is a progressive, degenerative disorder that attacks
the brain and impairs memory, thinking and behavior. Some 4.4
million Americans are affected, most of them older than 65,
according to the Alzheimer's Association. No cause or cure is known.
   Roses reported the new study last week at the annual meeting of
the American Academy of Neurology.
   In a telephone interview Monday, he said it is not clear what
percentage of Alzheimer's cases is accounted for by the form of the
disease the researchers studied.
   But he said that his findings might be applicable to so-called
sporadic cases of Alzheimer's.
   The new work was aimed at finding a location for a second gene
among the body's 23 pairs of chromosomes.
   The results suggest a ``very high likelihood'' that a defective
gene conferring susceptibility to late-onset familial Alzheimer's
resides in a portion of the chromosome numbered 19, Roses said.
   In 1987, other researchers said they had found evidence that a
gene or genes in a region of chromosome 21 was linked to a form of
Alzheimer's that strikes before age 65.
   Alzheimer's researcher Gerard Schellenberg of the University of
Washington in Seattle said Monday that while he has not seen a
final report of the new work, it appears to be ``extremely
interesting'' and worth more investigation. By a standard
statistical measure, the strength of the evidence is quite strong,
he said.
   The work was done by studying genetic material from 258 members
of 28 families that included cases of late-onset familial
Alzheimer's.
   Researchers essentially used three locations on chromosome 19 as
signposts and analyzed their data to check the likelihood that an
Alzheimer's gene lay near those locations.

   An heir to the Du Pont chemical fortune who
was found mentally incompetent after he gave money to political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche goes to court this week seeking to prove
he is fit to manage his own affairs.
   Lewis du Pont Smith, 33, heir to about $10 million, is due to
appear Tuesday in Common Pleas Court before Chester County Judge
Lawrence E. Wood. It will mark the latest development in a
5-year-old squabble pitting Smith against his parents.
   ``I have never had any mental illness or a breakdown in my
life,'' Smith said in an interview. ``I hope with this petition
that will be cleared up once and for all.''
   David Foulke, the attorney for Smith's parents, E. Newbold and
Margaret du Pont Smith of Paoli, said family members will testify
against him.
   ``They don't have to, but a couple of them will,'' he said.
``I'm not sure who will yet. I don't want to get into that at this
time.''
   On one side, the wealthy du Pont clan believes Smith is being
influenced by LaRouche. On the other, Smith says the family is
irked because they don't approve of his political beliefs.
   Relations between Smith and his family soured after he gave
LaRouche $212,000 for what Smith said was to benefit ``a publishing
venture.''
   Smith's parents argued in court that his association with
LaRouche indicated his inability to handle his money, and in
November 1985, Wood ordered that the family-owned Wilmington Trust
Co. monitor Smith's spending.
   Since that ruling, LaRouche has been convicted on conspiracy,
mail-and-tax fraud charges stemming from political fund-raising and
is serving a 15-year federal sentence.
   Smith said he hasn't given any money to LaRounche since 1985 but
still considers himself a supporter. He is running for Congress as
an independent, and his advertising cites LaRouche as ``the world's
leading physical economist.'' And Smith continues to argue that his
family is wrong about LaRouche.
   ``Lyndon LaRouche was best man at my wedding, but he has no
magical powers over me,'' Smith said. ``I have no intentions of
throwing away or giving away my fortune to Lyndon LaRouche. This
whole thing is so ridiculous.''
   He notes that under the order taking away his control over his
total fortune, he is allowed $15,000 a month, or $180,000 a year.
   ``If I'm competent to manage $180,000 a year, that seems to be
an inconsistency,'' he said.
   Through a series of appeals and hearings, Smith has repeatedly
asked the judge to reconsider his ruling and each time Wood has
refused.
   Over the objections of his family, Wood did agree to validate
Smith's marriage in December 1986 to 25-year-old Andrea Diano of
south Philadelphia.
   The hearing coming up this week will be the first at which Smith
actually takes the stand to testify. ``It really hurts,'' he said.
``I'm nervous about testifying, but my life is riding on this.''
   Foulke countered that ``the family believes Lewis is mentally
ill and it is in his best interest that the guardianship be
continued.''
   Meanwhile, Smith is waging a political campaign to get himself
elected to the 5th District congressional seat. The district
includes Philadelphia suburbs to the west and north.
   In order to run against incumbent Rep. Dick Schulze, R-Pa., in
the November election, Smith must collect 3,000 signatures on
election petitions by August. He will run as an independent.
   He said the campaign is going ``extremely well'' and expects to
gather far more than the minimum number of signatures needed. ``The
people know me well. They smell blood and their rooting for the
underdog.''
   Smith has bought blocks of time on six Philadelphia-area radio
stations to broadcast messages in support of independence for the
Soviet Republic of Lithuania. The air time reportedly cost an
estimated $6,000 to $8,000 a week.
   He also has run newspaper advertising. ``My five-year long
association with the world's leading physical economist, Lyndon H.
LaRouche Jr., the only economist to forecast the October 1987 stock
market crash five months before it occurred, will enable me to
bring a degree of economic expertise to Washington, that is
otherwise sorely lacking,'' he said in an ad last month in the
Daily Local News of West Chester.
   ``It is high time that the American citizenry took it upon
itself to sweep the economic incompetents that dominate the U.S.
Congress, out of Washington, D.C.''

<TEXT>
   Central America has achieved neither
peace nor complete democracy through the pact President Oscar Arias
drafted in 1987, but has taken steps toward both and is poised for
more.
   Arias, who ends his four-year term Tuesday and hands the
presidency to Rafael Calderon, wants to see the isthmus
demilitarized and its 28 million inhabitants achieve full human and
political rights in this decade.
   His departure marks the symbolic end of the group of five
presidents who set a region embroiled in wars on a path toward
peace. Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for leading the effort.
   Former President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador died of
cancer Feb. 23. Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras left office in January
and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua surrendered power last month after
an upset loss to Violetta Barrios de Chamorro.
   In a region known for coups and revolutions, all were replaced
in free elections.
   The fifth president who signed the peace plan in 1987 is Vinicio
Cerezo of Guatemala, scheduled to leave office in January 1991
after elections later this year.
   Arias feels the Central American gains could be diminished or
erased unless economic development accompanies democratization.
   ``It will not be possible to consolidate the democracies that
have emerged in Central America unless we're successful in the
economic and social fields,'' he said in an interview. ``This is
the great challenge. If the democracies don't deliver the goods, we
will not end the decade with democratic regimes.''
   Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, his foreign minister, said in a separate
interview: ``If a person lives in misery, liberty loses its
meaning.''
   Costa Rica is relatively prosperous, but misery abounds in the
four other nations between it and Mexico.
   Depressing statistics of life expectancy, infant mortality,
literacy and access to potable water make the region one of the
world's most desperate.
   Arias sees his country, the area's showcase of civic culture, as
a model for the others. Costa Rica abolished its armed forces 41
years ago and has lived in peace and democracy since.
   ``The decade of the '90s must be the decade of disarmament if we
want greater development,'' he said. ``Costa Rica buys tractors
while the rest of Central America buys tanks. Tractors produce
food. Tanks do not.
   ``The gap between the rich northern nations and the poor
southern ones continues to widen. Rich countries' (financial)
commitments to poor countries are not increasing, so we must depend
more on internal savings. We must dedicate our resources to the
satisfaction of our peoples' needs and not to buying arms.''
   The highest remaining hurdle for the Arias plan is El Salvador,
where a 10-year-old civil war continues to claim lives and spread
destruction.
   Leftist rebels and representatives of President Alfredo
Cristiani's U.S.-backed government are to resume peace talks this
month. Negotiations broke off late in 1989 after two fruitless
sessions.
   Rebel leaders say they want to abandon armed struggle for
political action, but also call Cristiani's government little more
than a civilian facade for a military regime that grossly violates
human rights.
   Insurgent demands include a purge of rights abusers from the
armed forces and reform of the judicial and electoral systems.
   Arias and Foreign Minister Madrigal say recent changes in
Eastern Europe and, as Arias put it, ``the end of the Cold War,''
make a propitious time for the Salvadoran talks.
   Neither the government nor rebels appears to have substantially
modified positions that led to stalemate last year, however.
   Moving Nicaragua's election ahead to February and an internal
agreement to end its civil war are the firmest results of the Arias
plan so far.
   A pact signed by U.S.-backed Contra rebels, the Sandinista army
and Mrs. Chamorro's anti-Sandinista government commits the Contras
to disband by June 10, but peace is not assured.
   Several thousand Contras are assembled in five internationally
monitored security zones inside Nicaragua.
   Contra commanders have made tough demands of Mrs. Chamorro,
principally that Sandinistas be purged from ranking positions in
the army and police, and express readiness to resume battle
otherwise.
   Honduras lost a great burden in April when thousands of Contras
based there for years abandoned their camps and returned to
Nicaragua, but consolidation of democracy in both Honduras and
Guatemala is proving slow and difficult.
   Their armed forces retain independent power far beyond that
afforded the military in true democracies. Corruption and drug
trafficking threaten to undermine progress toward modern democratic
systems.
   ``We cannot say the peace plan has been a success, that peace
and democracy have been established,'' Madrigal said, ``but we have
made notable advances and I see a new attitude that favors further
progress.''
   He spoke of the other countries, where dictatorships were the
norm for most of this century, as advancing along a sort of
democratic scale.
   ``Before, they were at zero,'' he said. ``Now they are at 10 or
15. They're far from 100, but it is inevitable that they will
continue to advance _ some in the short term; others will take
longer.''
   The Arias plan provides for a Central American parliament to
present a united voice to the world. Ironically, it is delayed
because the Costa Rican legislature has yet to approve.
   Arias described the reluctance as ``an idiotic superiority
complex.'' Many Costa Rican legislators argue that an established
democracy should not get involved in such a regional project with
less democratic governments.

   The Goddess of Democracy radio ship is headed
for troubled waters on its mission to broadcast pro-democracy
messages to China, risking retaliation from Beijing and raising
tensions in the region.
   The 1,200-ton ship, outfitted by Chinese dissidents, set sail
from France in March and began the last leg of its journey Thursday
after picking up provisions in Singapore.
   It is expected to reach international waters off China in about
two weeks to begin broadcasting.
   Chinese officials, who sent the army into Tiananmen Square to
crush the pro-democracy movement in June 1989, have refused to rule
out using force to stop the ship.
   Analysts believe China probably will jam the Goddess of
Democracy's broadcasts and may direct its navy to board the ship,
seize its equipment and make arrests.
   One diplomat said, on condition of anonymity, that the Chinese
might try to incapacitate the vessel by ramming it. What action
international law would allow on the high seas was unclear, he
added.
   Xu Tianfang, deputy secretary of the Paris-based Boat for China
Foundation, the project's main organizer, said from Taipei he could
not predict whether China would use force.
   ``We have sent journalists on board the ship and they will be
the witnesses if any such action occurs,'' he said.
   Using force against the ship probably would lead to
confrontation between China and several governments. The Goddess of
Democracy is registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, has a
French crew and carries Western journalists.
   The Chinese have pressured nearby governments to refuse
assistance to the ship. The Taiwan stock market fell for three
straight days after China accused the island of ``open
provocation'' by offering help to the vessel.
   As Taiwan became increasingly jittery, Goddess of Democracy
organizers said they would seek permission to call at Hong Kong, on
China's southeastern coast, to take on provisions.
   Officials of the British crown colony, which reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, are extremely sensitive about relations with
Beijing and announced Thursday the ship would not be allowed in its
waters.
   Chu Yung-chuan of Taiwan's Communications Ministry said Friday
the ship would be allowed to dock at the northern port of Keelung
unless his ministry received orders otherwise. So far, the
government has indicated the Goddess of Democracy could take on
provisions.
   An independent legislator announced plans to organize a flotilla
of fishing boats to escort the vessel when it approaches the island.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Wei Chia-ching, has said
the Taiwan military would protect the vessel if it came under
attack within Taiwan's ``defense zone,'' an area he refused to
define.
   The timing could not be worse for Taiwan, which is experiencing
a thaw in its historically chilly relations with the Communist
government in Beijing.
   Tension across the 100-mile-wide Taiwan Strait has eased
dramatically in recent years, accompanied by increasing trade and
travel.
   Secretary-general Hu Chi-Chiang of the Anti-Communist League, a
semi-official group, said 70 private Taiwan organizations had
decided to withhold donations to the ship.
   ``We absolutely support the ship, but we don't want to see
tension increase because of our support,'' he said.
   Threats from Beijing also forced organizers to abandon the
possibility of having Chinese dissident leaders who escaped to the
West, such as Wu'er Kaixi and Chai Ling, broadcast from the vessel.
   Xu said there would be no dissidents on the ship, but refused to
say who would make the broadcasts.
   The Goddess of Democracy, which left France on March 17, is
named for a statue erected by pro-democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square in May 1989, before the military crackdown in
which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed.

<HEAD>U.S. Not Sending Cabinet Minister To Environment Parley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike other Western countries, the United
States will not be represented on the ministerial level at a
conference on the environment that opens this week in Bergen, the
national news agency NTB reported.
   The ``Action for a Common Future'' conference in the west coast
city is expected to be attended by between 40 and 50 Cabinet
ministers among a total of 600 delegates from 34 countries. It
begins Tuesday and runs to May 16.
   The American delegation will be headed by John A. Knauss, a
Commerce Department official and former professor of oceanography,
the agency quoted press attache John Matel of the U.S. Embassy as
saying.
   NTB said in the report Sunday that Knauss would be heading ``a
delegation of 12 politicians and low-level civil servants
representing the Departments of State and Energy and the
Environment Protection Agency.''
   The Norwegian government expressed regret that the United States
was not being represented by a Cabinet minister, the agency said.
   It quoted Norway's state secretary Kai Eide as saying it had
hoped EPA chief William K. Reilly would have taken part.
   The Bergen conference aims to follow up recommendations of the
``Our Common Future'' report by the U.N. World Commission on
Environment and Development.
   It was organized by Norway in cooperation with the European
Commission for Europe, which includes the United States and Canada.

   Leaders of Congress say serious budget
negotiations with the White House now appear likely, with
everything on the table _ including the possibility of new taxes.
   The leaders left the White House Sunday night after a private
90-minute meeting with President Bush saying they would be back for
more talks with the president after consulting with other lawmakers.
   They said they discussed no specifics with Bush, but established
that whatever negotiations take place will be without preconditions.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, asked if things now were on track for
full-scale budget negotiations, said, ``I think that's going to be
the outcome.''
   Asked if Bush stood ready to drop his no-new-taxes pledge, Foley
said no specifics were discussed, but he added, ``The assumption is
that all matters would be on the table, that we would not enter any
talks with preconditions.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said, ``There was a
general agreement that any discussions will be without
preconditions, if and when they occur.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said the lawmakers expect to
meet again with Bush late Tuesday after conferring with colleagues,
including leaders of the key budget and tax-writing committees.
   The White House had no comment on the talks, deputy spokesman
Stephen Hart said.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel also took part in the unusual
90-minute session in Bush's private residence. The talks took place
after Bush, the congressional leaders and 200 other guests attended
a lecture on Theodore Roosevelt's presidency by author David
McCullough.
   The full House and Senate Budget Committees approved Democratic
versions of the 1991 budget last week.
   Congress and the White House have made repeated efforts in
recent years to forge grand compromises on the deficit. Most have
fallen short of expectations.
   Congress has ignored the $1.2 trillion budget blueprint that
Bush submitted Jan. 29. That budget was supposed to meet the
Gramm-Rudman target of a deficit no larger than $64 billion for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Sluggish economic growth and rising interest rates have driven
up the deficit since then.
   Foley said he expects more lasting results this time.
   ``All of us who took part in this meeting today feel that we
need a major and meaningful effort that has been somewhat lacking
for various reasons in past years'' to narrow the deficit for next
year and over several years, the speaker said.
   ``I think there's goodwill on all sides in attempting to deal
with the fiscal problems the country faces,'' said Foley. ``We're
going to, I think, find a way to deal effectively with them.''
   Bush was joined at the meeting by White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu, budget director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. Brady came directly from talks on Capitol Hill with
finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations _ the other major
Western democracies.
   The 1990 deficit was supposed to be $99 billion under a budget
deal that Bush and Congress struck in April 1989. But that has been
undone by higher spending and slower than expected growth of tax
revenues. Now the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office expects
the 1990 shortfall to reach $159 billion, up from $152 billion in
1989.

   A 16-year-old youth on trial for
assault pulled out a machete in court today and attacked the judge
hearing his case, seriously injuring her, authorities said.
   The 60-year-old judge, Augusta Wallace, suffered deep facial
wounds and was rushed to Middlemore Hospital, where she was listed
in stable condition.
   Police said it was the first time in New Zealand that a judge
had been attacked in court. They said the youth apparently smuggled
the machete into the Children and Young Persons Court by hiding it
inside his trouser leg.
   The teen-ager was appearing on a charge of reckless driving,
excess blood alcohol, car stealing and assault on police. Police
said he had not been in police custody before the hearing.

   Life is a slow, tedious limbo at a place called
Krome, and tempers are short and getting shorter.
   Krome, the Krome Service Processing Center, is where newcomers
from Haiti and other countries await word on their future in the
United States.
   Many people pass through the fenced-in holding center, but most
are Haitian refugees, some with stories to tell of alleged abuse
and neglect at the hands of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Miami's Haitian community is generally considered peaceful, but
on April 29, more than 1,000 Haitians demonstrated outside Krome,
tearing at its fences after years of seeing their countrymen locked
up while others go free.
   ``We want freedom and justice for the Haitian refugees and all
the refugees detained,'' said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a Haitian
community leader. ``We must break down the walls of Krome, which
reminds us of Hitlerism.''
   On average, two-thirds of the center's 400 or so residents are
Haitians. They are picked up at the airport with fake passports and
visas or plucked from rickety boats by the Coast Guard while trying
to slip into the United States.
   Arrivals at Krome, a former missile base on the steamy edge of
the Everglades 25 miles west of Miami, are dressed in orange
uniforms and given medical exams. And then they wait.
   ``The most horrible part of this place is time,'' said Nuhu
Aminu, 35, a TV production specialist from Nigeria.
   The average stay at Krome is 18 months, sometimes more than two
years. Detainees wait to learn whether they will be deported or
released.
   ``The one thing people kind of lose sight of is that we don't go
out and try to shanghai these people,'' Krome administrator
Constance Weiss said. ``They're here because they attempted to
break the law.''
   In affidavits, many signed with encoded names to avoid
reprisals, Krome detainees have told of experiences far more
horrible than agonized waiting. Women have said they are sexually
abused and harassed by guards.
   ``The Krome officers often told the male detainees at Krome that
they had sex with the female detainees. They bragged about this and
laughed and thought it was real great,'' said Chantale Pierre, a
former detainee who now lives in Miami.
   Men and women have complained of beatings and restricted access
to telephones and bathrooms. Haitian detainees say Latins get
preferential treatment.
   Detainees say they often aren't given enough time to eat their
meals and have charged that an aspirin substitute is given for any
complaint.
   ``On many occasions we are physically abused,'' one detainee
said. ``Since we are scared and don't speak English, we keep
quiet.''
   The allegations angered many in the Haitian community, sparking
the April 29 demonstration that ended with no arrests and the
retreat of the protesters.
   The allegations have stirred up INS officials, two of whom
visited Krome on April 24. Shortly afterward the agency announced
the additions of two more immigration judges and 27 guards to
improve conditions and speed up the wait.
   On May 1, the INS began an already-planned test program under
which about 200 detainees will be released in Miami, Los Angeles,
New York and San Francisco. They must meet certain conditions,
including having what appears to be a good case for asylum and a
source of income or support, posting a bond of $500 to $2,500, and
agreeing in writing to surrender for deportation if ordered.
   The Justice Department is looking into allegations of abuse at
Krome. Because of the investigation, Miami INS director Richard
Smith and Krome officials would not comment on the detainees'
complaints.
   Meanwhile, life at Krome drags on.
   Detainees spend their days cleaning their quarters, watching
television, playing volleyball or basketball outside or lounging
under shelters. Men and women cluster at the 10-foot fences that
keep them apart.
   ``Sometimes we stay in bed, think about everything,'' said a
Haitian who asked that her name not be revealed. ``Think about your
country, think about your family. We suffer.''
   Detainees also take classes. They can work toward high school
equivalency diplomas, learn English or study crafts such as
ceramics and sewing. Some work, earning a dollar a day as laborers
at the camp.
   Sick detainees go to a clinic with an emergency room and X-ray
and dental facilities. Mental health professionals also are on duty.
   Detainess watch video movies, mostly in English, every night,
Weiss said.
   ``One thing you have to do is keep yourself together,'' said
Detto Bilkerdyk, who works in the Krome sign shop. A former
military policeman from Suriname, he said he left home fearing for
his life after refusing orders to commit executions.
   ``If they deport me back home I know I'm dead,'' he said.

<HEAD>Veteran Congressman, Populist Attorney General Vie for McClure's
Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican James McClure's decision to
retire from the U.S. Senate has set up a struggle between two
would-be successors in a plot straight from a Frank Capra movie.
   Jim Jones, a plucky, populist attorney general with almost no
cash or campaign staff, is giving five-term congressman Larry Craig
a spirited but possibly futile run for his money in the May 22
Republican primary.
   ``I've always been an underdog in my political races,'' said
Jones, who ran for the House twice before winning the state's top
legal office in 1982. ``It's a role that I don't mind; you have to
try harder.''
   Craig, 44, is campaigning on his record and generally playing
the role of the cautious, veteran politician above the fray.
   Jones, 47, is cast as the scrappy, nothing-to-lose challenger
with a folksy, accessible style and independent agenda.
   ``I've got more courage and innovation than Craig has,'' Jones
said. ``He's been in Congress for 10 years and has done very
little.''
   The Craig campaign is a juggernaut fueled by essentially the
same field and fundraising organization that made McClure all but
unbeatable for three House and three Senate terms. McClure,
however, has made no formal endorsement.
   Through the first three months of the year, Craig had built up a
war chest of $260,000 while spending $135,000. Jones had received
contributions of less than $19,000 and most of it was quickly spent.
   The winner of the GOP primary is expected to face Boise
businessman Ron Twilegar in November. Twilegar, 46, is a former
state Senate minority leader who faces token opposition in the
Democratic primary.
   While Craig is the heavy favorite, there is a perception he
remains a relatively untested and possibly thin-skinned campaigner,
with a formal, somewhat stiff manner.
   Democrats had to scramble to find replacement candidates to
challenge him when the 1984 nominee died in a car accident and the
front-runner in the party's 1986 primary was killed in a plane
crash.
   The implication irks Craig.
   ``I've won, but I've worked hard in each case,'' he said.
   With a network of volunteers in every county, Craig contends he
has made quick progress in heavily Republican eastern and southern
Idaho, where most of the party's statewide primaries are decided.
   ``We've spent a lot of time there, and I may run very well in
the south and southeast, better than I had anticipated,'' he said.
``I'm finding the support for Jim Jones there is very soft.''
   If true, that may be partially a result of Jones' lack of money
for major advertising in a far-flung state where key markets are
separated by mountains and hundreds of miles.
   Jones has tried to get his message out through news conferences
and personal appearances, usually traveling alone. His primary
focus has been on pocketbook issues such as consumer protection,
possible pricing collusion in the oil and meatpacking industries
and action needed to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Jones has tried to undercut Craig's position as a primary
sponsor of a proposed balanced budget amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. Over the past 10 years, Jones contends, Craig has
``continually weakened it to the point where it's meaningless in an
effort to get more co-sponsors.''
   Jones knows his kind of underfinanced, one-man campaign has not
succeeded in Idaho since Democrat Glen Taylor, known as the
``Singing Cowboy,'' won a Senate seat in 1944. But he remains
optimistic.
   ``It's a disadvantage, but it's something that can be overcome
by just sheer determination, hard work and free publicity, and I've
been pretty good over the years in generating coverage,'' he said.
   Craig is clearly ahead, but he won't reveal the results of his
own polling. He credits organization, but chafes at Jones'
contention it was inherited from McClure.
   ``I inherited nothing,'' Craig said. ``Jim McClure did not call
anyone or ask anyone to work on my behalf. I did it myself.''

<HEAD>Sakharov Memoirs Recall Exile, Despair and Triumph</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Sakharov, the late Soviet physicist and
human rights champion, wrote that his life and work in many ways
paralleled the violence, repression and eventually the reforms that
have swept his homeland.
   Excerpts from Sakharov's memoirs appeared in The Sunday Times of
London in advance of British publication in July.
   He died in Moscow on Dec. 14 at age 68 after a heart attack.
   The book, titled ``Memoirs,'' will be published in June in the
United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. Excerpts also will appear in
Time magazine's May 14 and May 21 issues.
   Sakharov, who endured years of persecution by Soviet authorities
but was mourned as a hero and visionary, recalled the awe and fear
he felt when he heard of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the
United States in 1945.
   ``I was so stunned that my legs practically gave way,'' wrote
Sakharov, who was considered the father of his own country's
hydrogen bomb.
   ``There could be no doubt that my fate and the fate of many
others, perhaps of the entire world, had changed overnight,'' he
said in The Sunday Times excerpts. ``Something new and awesome had
entered our lives, a product of the greatest of the sciences, of
the discipline I revered.''
   In the Time excerpts, he wrote of the ``tragedy, cruelty and
terror'' of the era of his childhood, the 1920s and early 1930s,
and remembered the Stalinist repression that left parents afraid to
speak freely before their children.
   ``This reluctance to reveal one's thoughts even to one's own son
may be the most haunting sign of those times,'' he wrote.
   Later, Sakharov's calls for political reforms presaged many of
the changes under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow in 1986 after nearly seven
years of internal exile in the city of Gorky.
   In the memoirs, Sakharov said that after World War II, when he
was made a member of Igor Tamm's top-secret team developing the
H-bomb at the Physics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
``nobody asked if I wanted to take part _ I had no real choice.''
   ``But the concentration, total absorption and energy that I
brought to the task were my own,'' he recalled in The Sunday Times
exceprts.
   ``I understood the terrifying, inhuman nature of the weapons we
were building,'' he wrote. ``But the recent war had also been an
exercise in barbarity.''
   It was Sakharov's call for a worldwide nuclear test ban in the
late 1950s that first brought him into conflict with Soviet
authorities.
   During the last three decades of his life, he fought against the
jailing of innocent people, for free emigration and for disarmament
and other causes.
   He said he was not convinced that mutual assured nuclear
destruction had truly helped to keep the peace.
   ``Thermonuclear weapons could end human civilization. They have
become so frightening that the very thought of using them seems
unreal. Their credibility as a deterrent has thus decreased, while
their threat has increased enormously,'' he wrote.
   The first extract from Sakharov's memoirs dealt mainly with his
being sent to internal exile in 1980 for criticizing Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.

   Yoko Ono says her son, Sean, helped her pull
through after the murder of her husband, John Lennon.
   ``Some days, I felt life wasn't worth it, but it was important
that I stay around for Sean, or he would have lost two parents,''
Ono said in an interview in Sunday's Daily News Magazine.
   Sean, now 14, was 5 when his ex-Beatle father was slain. He
attends school in Switzerland and hopes for a music career.
   Ono said she prefers he choose another path but won't stand in
his way.
   ``I love him very much, wish John was here to see him grow,''
she said. ``Maybe he's watching.''
   Lennon was shot to death in 1980. His killer, Mark Chapman, is

   Confirmation came about five weeks ago, he said.
   Kennebunk will graduate 147 seniors June 10.
   Mrs. Bush also is scheduled to deliver the commencement address

   A closed museum boasting the world's
largest collection of Bruce Springsteen memorabilia wants to sell
it intact for at least $50,000.
   Among the items for sale: a rare 1966 unreleased single by
Springsteen's first band, the Castiles; a surfboard; Springsteen's
1970 driver's license, and his draft card.
   The Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum shut down last year.
   Billy Smith, a co-owner of most of the Springsteen artifacts,
said he hopes a buyer will keep them in Asbury Park, where the
singer got his start.
   ``Hopefully, somebody will buy this stuff and display it,''
Smith said.
   Asbury Park, a down-at-the-heels resort town, is the setting for
some of Springsteen's early songs.
   The museum was in the Palace Amusement Arcade, where parts of
Springsteen's ``Tunnel of Love'' video were shot. When the arcade
closed last year, so did the museum, and its contents went into

   Mel Harris has defined yuppie wife and mom on
television's ``thirtysomething,'' and now she's living it.
   Two years ago, Harris, who plays Hope Steadman on the ABC
series, wasn't thinking of domestic bliss after her marriage to
photographer David Hume Kennerly ended.
   ``I didn't want a relationship or anything even remotely similar
to the life I have now,'' Harris said in an interview in the May 14
People magazine.
   But Harris remarried 18 months ago, to actor Cotter Smith of
ABC's ``Equal Justice,'' and their life together has definite
``thirtysomething'' tendencies.
   Harris is breast-feeding the couple's month-old daughter. Her
6-year-old son from her marriage to Kennerly is in kindergarten.
She has two dogs. Construction workers are busy remodeling the
couple's house.
   Smith, who also considered himself a sufferer of post-romantic
stress disorder, met Harris on the set of a 1987 horror film.
``Both of our relationships had fallen apart, so we had a lot to
talk about,'' Harris said.

<HEAD>FmHA Reports Foreclosure Activity Rising</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: 1st add is state-by-state table.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Farmers Home Administration has written
off nearly one-third of $8.8 billion owed by delinquent borrowers
and says there is an increase in foreclosure activity to collect
the rest.
   As of March 31, reports by the Agriculture Department agency
show that proceedings were initiated against 4,110 farmers in the
first six months of the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That
compared with 5,002 in all of the 1989 fiscal year and 1,459 in
1988.
   Agency officials say the trend is expected to continue at least
through the rest of this year.
   Spokeswoman Marlyn Aycock said that 75,352 collection notices
were sent out beginning in late 1988 and that 32,584 were resolved
by being paid off, brought up to date or otherwise settled.
   But that left more than 42,000 overdue loans still hanging fire.
Many of those have been appealed or are in some kind of mediation
with the agency.
   The FmHA often is called the government's farm lender of last
resort, and eligible borrowers cannot qualify for loans from
commercial lenders.
   Procedures for collecting and servicing FmHA loans were refined
by Congress in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, including
requirements that collectors tell delinquent borrowers about
various liberalized debt-serving options available.
   The law also provided for write-downs and write-offs of loans in
cases where collection costs would exceed the recovery value. In
many cases, FmHA had made loans far in excess of the eventual value
of a farmer's assets.
   Land values, the main asset of farmers, plummeted in the 1980s
and wiped out much of the collateral worth held by borrowers. As a
result many wound up owing a bundle without sufficient net worth or
cash flow.
   Aycock said that as of Nov. 30 _ the most recent tabulation _
about $796 million had been written down, an average of $172,857 on
4,608 loans. In these cases, loans were reduced to the current
value of the collateral.
   Similarly, 5,029 borrowers were allowed to ``buy out'' their
loans at current liquidation values. This write-off amounted to
more than $1.03 billion, an average of $205,674.
   The excused debts have included nearly 100 individuals who each
have had FmHA loans reduced or written off by $1 million or more.
   Aycock said that $933 million in old debt also has been written
off by FmHA as uncollectable. Those involve 6,341 dead-end
accounts, some going back 10 years or more.
   The number of potential foreclosures is indicated by
``acceleration letters'' sent to thousands of delinquent borrowers.
The acceleration process is a major step toward final closeout of
an FmHA loan through foreclosure.
   Another indicator _ the next step _ is the number of accelerated
cases referred to USDA lawyers to await formal foreclosure action
by the government.
   By comparison, the number of actual foreclosures by the agency _
those that have gone through final settlement _ is relatively
small. But those also are beginning to increase.
   So far this fiscal year, the records showed 107 foreclosure
actions completed, plus 113 by banks and other lienholders that
share loans with the agency.
   That compared with only 45 foreclosures by FmHA and 258 by other
lienholders in fiscal 1989. In 1988, FmHA foreclosed on 58
borrowers and other lienholders, 504.
   But foreclosures aren't the only way FmHA can collect what is
owed, nor are foreclosures the only reason for farmers to go out of
business.
   Pressure by FmHA can result in the sale of property, in which
case the debt is often settled, or voluntary transfer of property
to the agency as part of a settlement deal.
   Although the FmHA records are still sketchy, figures for the
first half of fiscal 1990 show that the pace of those who are
quitting the farm ``due to financial difficulties'' of all types,
is increasing.
   In fiscal 1988, 3,159 FmHA farm borrowers quit because of
financial trouble. That represented 1.3 percent of the agency's
total number of farm borrowers. In 1989, the number dropped to
2,046 who left farming, or 0.9 percent of the agency's borrowers.
   So far this year, according to first-half figures, 1,314
farmers, or 0.6 percent of the FmHA's 218,000 farm borrowers, have
quit the land. That would be an annual rate of 1.2 percent if the
pace continues the remainder of the year.

   Political passions have come alive in
Romania after decades of repression and their target is often
interim President Ion Iliesco, seen by critics as a Communist agent
in liberal disguise.
   A round-the-clock rally by Iliescu's foes, which began sixteen
days ago, has transformed downtown University Square into what the
demonstrators call a ``Communist-free zone.''
   Iliescu was a high official under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
who was overthrown and executed in December, but fell out of favor
and was given relatively unimportant party jobs. He gained
prominence during the revolution, when the National Salvation Front
was formed to run the government.
   Up to 10,000 people have filled the square to applaud speakers,
from national figures to workers, who demand that Iliescu resign.
About 40 tents have been pitched around the square and 57
protesters are on a hunger strike.
   Supporters of Iliescu have held at least one rally and rumors
persist of plans for an attack on the University Square protest.
   Knots of people form around University Square every day to argue
about Iliescu and the elections scheduled for May 20, which will be
the first free vote for Romanians in 50 years.
   ``People here in the square hate Iliescu because he wants us to
live in darkness!'' a woman shouted, thrusting her chin toward a
supporter of the president, who retorted: ``He doesn't want to keep
Romania in darkness! He wants to create a bright Romania!''
   Another woman swept an arm toward the crowd in the square and
asked: ``How can Romania become a prosperous country, if people
camp outside like this without working?''
   On April 29, tens of thousands of people demonstrated against
Iliescu in Timisoara, Dej and the port city of Constanta.
   Timisoara, in western Romania, was where the uprising against
Ceausecu began.
   In rural Romania, horse carts still are the principal mode of
transport and people wait up to a week for telephone calls to or
from abroad. Many have no access to television, cannot read
newspapers and accept rumors as fact.
   ``Is it true that revolution has broken out in the capital?''
asked a gypsy woman openly selling black market cigarettes in
Tecuci, a Moldavian town 150 miles northeast of Bucharest.
   Moldavia has been relatively quiet, but there is a surge of
nationalism among Moldavians across the Soviet border, which was
opened for six hours of visa-free travel on Sunday.
   Vasile Dogaru, deputy mayor of Iasi, the cultural capital of
Moldavia, said Moldavians in Romania ``seek no more than increased
cultural ties with our brethren'' in the Soviet Union.
   Many Romanians, however _ including Iliescu _ have said all
Moldavia must be part of Romania.
   In Transylvania, where Timisoara is located, historic frictions
between Romanians and the large ethnic Hungarian minority turned
violent in March.
   At least six people were killed in Tirgu Mures, 180 miles
northwest of Bucharest, and 300 were injured before the army could
restore order.
   Representatives of Romania's 2.2 million Hungarians say their
struggle for minority rights is being suppressed, as it was under
Ceausescu.
   Part of the support for Iliescu rests on the interim
government's ability to provide relative plenty after years of
privation under Ceausescu, who starved the people to pay off the
foreign debt with exports.
   Generous foreign aid, an end to food exports, increased energy
imports and mild weather since February have kept people fed and
warm, but luxury items such as chocolate and citrus fruits are in
short supply.

   Moscow is a long way to travel for a
burger and fries, but there's a lesson to be learned for the four
students making the trip.
   To make sure the 14-year-olds from Enslow Middle School
understand the ins and outs of world economics, the trip's sponsor,
Steel of West Virginia Inc., is laying down just one rule: they
must stand in line at the Moscow McDonald's during their 11-day
tour of the Soviet Union and Berlin.
   The company's vice president of human affairs, Larry Gue, said
the lesson will be found in the difference between the inexpensive
fast-food at McDonald's in Huntington and the one in Moscow, where
customers stand in line for hours to spend a substantial chunk of
their paycheck for essentially the same items.
   ``The idea is hopefully they'll understand the American free
enterprise system,'' Gue said.
   The students, chosen from among 25 members of an eighth-grade
civics class, leave on Wednesday.

   Elvis. The man, the music, the curtain.
   The elementary school that Elvis Presley attended is cashing in
on its most famous pupil, selling scraps of the maroon velveteen
curtains that hung on the stage when Presley was a shy, barefoot
boy singing at weekday devotionals.
   The going price is $5 for a 5-inch square, and the Lawhon School
has already reaped $3,000. The money has gone toward new playground
equipment and a $1,700 sound system for the auditorium.
   Principal Dale Dobbs said he's amazed that Elvis fans are so
eager to buy anything connected to him.
   ``When the old stage curtains were taken down, they were stored
away and not disposed of, probably because someone had the
foresight to realize that they might be a novelty. They are
definitely that,'' Dobbs said.
   The sales started last summer after the school's parent-teacher
organization got the idea to offer scraps of the tattered curtains
to visitors arriving for the anniversary of Presley's death on Aug.
16, 1977.
   Superintendent Richard Thompson said that for years fans have
stopped by the school to beg for anything that Elvis might have
used as a student.
   ``Now we have something to offer them,'' he said.

   Thomas Catherall had to be on his best behavior
as a judge in the U.S. Chefs Open, especially when he started
chewing one amateur chef's lamb kebab.
   ``I could have eaten my shoe and it would have been more
tasty,'' said Catherall, head chef at the Cherokee Town and Country
Club in Atlanta.
   But overall, Catherall, one of 33 certified master chefs in the
country, gave the amateur chefs high marks for their culinary
creations.
   ``There was some awful stuff, but there was some very good
stuff, too,'' the 26-year cooking veteran said as he pulled two
rolls of antacid tablets from his pocket. ``I only went through
half a roll yesterday.''
   As Catherall and a team of top chefs from around the country
judged entries from professional chefs Sunday, thousands of
food-loving spectators tasted their way through 100,000 square feet
of wines, cheeses, lobster, chicken and pizza offered by
restaurants and food vendors who set up shop inside the Georgia
World Congress Center.
   Sponsors said 60,000 people attended this year's second annual
chefs open.
   The top student, amateur and professional chefs who competed in
the competition were chosen from among 10,000 entrants and
collected cash prizes of up to $2,500. The grand-prize winners also
won a week at Le Cordon Bleu, the international cooking school in
Paris.

<TEXT>
   The National Rainbow Coalition came to town to
put together its strategy for the next year, and a lot of political
attitudes got adjusted in Jesse Jackson's favor.
   The conference, which ended Sunday, was billed as a plenary
session with an eye toward reapportionment in the South in 1991. It
wound up tangling with the question of black unity within the
Democratic Party.
   Jackson, the Rainbow Coalition leader who has run twice for
president, slapped backs with major black Democrats _ Democratic
National Committee Chairman Ronald Brown, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
   Jackson spent much of his time pushing for statehood for the
District of Columbia _ something that would create a congressional
seat for which he could run.
   Young and Wilder, whose quiet, mainstream politics are in stark
contrast to Jackson's vocal, activist style, came out in support of
Jackson's efforts. And Jackson endorsed the gubernatorial bid of
Young, who was roundly booed by Jackson delegates during the 1984
Democratic National Convention.
   There was talk of working within the Democratic Party and moves
to end speculation that Jackson and Wilder are locked in a battle
over how the party should proceed to become competitive again in
presidential elections.
   Wilder, whose status as the nation's first black elected
governor could make him a formidable rival to Jackson's position as
the top black politician in the party, said he has no problem with
Jackson's leadership.
   He said he came to Jackson's conference to ``show those who
would care to see there isn't that opportunity to split us up or
cause us to go one-on-one with one another.''
   Jackson, who has never been elected to public office, said he
and Wilder are ``inextricably bound'' in their direction; they
simply have differing styles.
   ``He calls it the new mainstream,'' Jackson said. ``I call it
expansion.''
   Brown, the DNC's first black chairman, set out to discourage
talk that Jackson was a divisive force in the party. He said
Jackson's bringing thousands of voters into the party proves he was
no impediment during the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``In fact, he's one of the greatest assets to our party,'' Brown
said. ``He was not the reason we do not have a Democrat in the
White House.''
   But those under the Rainbow wanted to make it clear that they
will play hardball with the Democrats to make sure the party
addresses the concerns they expressed in Atlanta.
   ``I don't think we have a Democratic Party I can give my support
to, in spite of what Ron Brown says,'' said Mayor Ben Nichols of
Ithaca, N.Y. ``What I do know is that in the long run, we can have
a Democratic Party which is a real Democratic Party, because we can
organize it together.''
   Meanwhile, Washington Mayor Marion Barry quietly took part in a
mayoral conference on re-shaping urban America _ one that skimmed
over the issue of drugs and drug crime in big cities.
   Barry, who faces trial June 4 on cocaine possession and perjury
charges, got at least two standing ovations from people loyal to
Jackson, who turned down a chance to run for Barry's job.
   Barry humbly thanked the crowd for ``your heartfelt and
deep-running prayers during my situation.''
   He deferred to Jackson's leadership, expressing ``great
excitement'' about ``the vision of Jesse Jackson ... to call us
together here in Atlanta.''
   ``I'm glad to be here on the cutting edge of this progressive
agenda,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reed Says He Was Beaten Severely After Escape Attempts</HEAD>

   Former hostage Frank Reed, in a riveting
account of the brutal beatings he suffered at the hands of his
Islamic captors, says he kept his spirits up by using matches to
draw pictures of his family.
   He drew images of his Syrian-born wife, Fifi, and son, Tarek, on
the ceiling and the door of his cell to remind himself that he must
stay alive if he wanted to see them again, Reed said Sunday at a
news conference.
   ``I knew ... if I didn't keep my life going there certainly
wasn't going to be any Fifi or any Tarek,'' he said. ``And that
permeates and transcends all of our thinking.''
   Reed called for negotiations to free the remaining six Americans
and 10 other Westerners held hostage, ``even if you have to get in
bed with the devil.''
   He said that on several occasions his captors told him that
``all they want is someone to talk to us. ... We had some not so
nice (thoughts) ... about people we thought weren't willing to
trade or negotiate for our lives.''
   The 57-year-old Reed interrupted his hospital stay to give
reporters a chilling glimpse of his life as a hostage in Lebanon
for 44 months. He said he was double-chained to a wall or radiator
and blindfolded much of the time.
   Reed said his Islamic kidnappers broke his nose, jaw and ribs,
slightly fractured his feet with iron rods and bloodied his kidneys
for trying to escape twice.
   ``Thank God they didn't kill me,'' he said. ``I was one of their
pet whackers. I did everything in my power not to cry out and not
let them think they were ever going to get a single advantage on
me. And I didn't.''
   His account stunned another freed hostage, fellow educator
Robert Polhill, who was at his side at the news conference. Polhill
was freed eight days before Reed, who was released a week ago.
   ``I was as shocked as you were to hear what Frank has been
saying here,'' Polhill said. ``I can't say that I was maltreated. I
was never beaten. We were not blindfolded, things of that sort.''
   Polhill also differed with Reed on negotiations. He said he
agreed with President Bush's position of refusing to negotiate for
their release. ``I don't like the thought of negotiating for human
lives,'' Polhill said. ``I just don't think it's right.''
   Reed said other hostages were mistreated but not as badly as he
was. He did not elaborate or identify them.
   But he said he was held at varying times with Terry Anderson,
the chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press; Thomas
Sutherland, a dean at the American University of Beirut; John
McCarthy, a British television journalist; and Brian Keenan, an
Irish teacher of English at the American University of Beirut.
   Reed said he last saw Anderson 18 months ago and Sutherland 14
months ago. He left McCarthy, he said, two days before he was freed.
   He said the kidnappers made doctors and dentists available to
the hostages if they asked for them.
   ``Fortunately for me,'' Reed said, ``the worst I had was maybe
one cold and a half all the time I was there ... The others have
not been quite as fortunate. They have been ill and I pray that
whatever the illness was, it is not that serious that it can't
eventually be corrected.''
   He said Anderson, Sutherland, McCarthy and Keenan had been
vigorously exercising and ``look wonderful physically.'' He said he
stopped exercising because ``I was angry that I had no freedom.''
   Over the past two years, he said, the hostages were given boxes
of books to read. ``John and Brian and especially Terry go through
a book a day,'' he said. They were held in bedrooms in apartments
most of the time, he said.
   At one point, the kidnappers allowed them to have a radio for
about three months over which they listened to BBC, the Voice of
America and local stations. The hostages heard one broadcast
quoting the kidnappers as threatening to kill Anderson and
Sutherland if the United States didn't take a certain action.
   ``The reaction from us was `baloney, they won't do it,''' said
Reed. ``And within 30 minutes some captain came down and said,
`Don't worry about that,' and we said, `We're not going to.'''
   Reed said that after his first escape attempt, his Hezbollah
guards battered him with more than 200 blows, and he was eventually
put in solitary confinement for more than two years.
   Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader from Kansas, and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., also spoke at the news
conference, calling for the release of the remaining hostages.
   Dole urged foreign leaders to press for the hostages' release,
and Moynihan urged Israel to release the Moslem prisoners it holds.
   ``It is in their interest to do and if they're part of the world
nations seeking legality and decency, they should now act to bring
it about in Lebanon,'' Moynihan said.
   Syrian and Iranian officials said Sunday the release of any more
American hostages likely hinges on Israel's willingness to free
hundreds of Moslem prisoners, including Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Shiite cleric taken from his home in southern Lebanon in 1989.
   President Bush on Thursday again appealed for the release of all
hostages, but avoided comment on whether that should include 400
Shiites held by Israel.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people who came to
industrialized southern Brazil seeking work are now returning home,
frustrated by the rising unemployment the government's austerity
plan has wrought.
   ``I arrived here with almost nothing, and I'm going back with
less,'' said Jose Loreno Filho, 30, as he prepared to board a bus
late last week at Sao Paulo's huge Tiete bus station.
   He had a ticket home to a tiny village in impoverished Alagoas
state on the northeastern coast.
   Loreno Filho, who had once worked a small plot of land in
Alagoas, scrimped together about $50 and bus fare to come to Sao
Paulo in early March. He stayed with relatives and hoped to earn
money to bring his wife and four children to join him.
   But on March 16, Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de
Mello, launched his austerity plan in a bid to defeat record
inflation that reached nearly 5,000 percent over the past year.
   While the initiatives, which include an 18-month freeze on $115
billion in bank deposits, have drastically reduced the cost of
living, businesses have fired hundreds of thousands of workers.
   ``I walked the streets for the past two months, and there aren't
any jobs,'' said Loreno Filho. ``The streets aren't paved with gold
the way I imagined.
   Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial center, has
attracted millions of migrants during the past two decades. Most
came from the northeast to escape that region's grinding poverty.
   But since Collor's economic plan was announced, the stream of
economic refugees has been at least temporarily reversed.
   ``Our buses to the northeast have been packed for the past six
weeks. And when buses from the region arrive at the station,
they've been almost empty,'' said Elias Perreira, manager of the
Sao Geraldo bus line, the major company servicing the northeast
from Sao Paulo, a city of 7 million people.
   He said the movement to the northeast is now only slightly above
normal. But in mid-April, the company was carrying 1,700 passengers
a day, twice the normal number. It needed 11 extra buses a day to
accommodate the crunch.
   Many of the returning migrants were working in construction,
which was especially hard hit by Collor's program. An estimated
300,000 construction workers were laid off nationwide, more than
one-third of them in Sao Paulo.
   Edmilson Mariano de Oliveira, 27, who arrived in Sao Paulo eight
months ago from the northeastern state of Piaui, recently lost his
construction job.
   ``I've got a wife and two young kids back there, so I'd always
planned on going back. But I didn't think it would be so soon,'' he
said.
   ``I'll be happy to see my family, but there's not much work to
be had other than subsistence farming,'' he said.
   Ana Correia Salles, a local social worker, said 99 percent of
construction workers in the area are northeasterners, and most
sleep and eat at the job site: ``If they lose their job, they lose
everything, so it's either live on the streets or return home.''
   Even some longtime residents of the city are packing their bags.
   Jose Francilino, 40, brought his family here from the
northeastern state of Pernambuco in 1977. He said he'd always been
able to find work.
   One week after Collor took office, though, he was fired from his
longtime job as a metalworker. He was now heading to Pernambuco.
   ``I never thought I'd be leaving, but I don't know what else to
do. My father still works the land, and I wrote to tell him we'd be
needing a place to stay for awhile,'' he said as his wife tried to
quiet the youngest of their four children.
   Ms. Salles, the social worker, said the plight of migrants shows
Collor was wrong when he claimed that only the rich were paying the
cost of economic adjustment.
   ``The wealthy lost their savings, but the poor are losing their
jobs. I'd say that's just as important,'' she said.

<HEAD>Advocates Worry About Loss of Interest in Inner-City Drug Woes</HEAD>

   The perception that illegal drug use is
decreasing among suburban whites could lead to a reduced sense of
urgency in fighting the nation's war on drugs, some analysts say.
   As a result, they say, mostly black inner-city neighborhoods may
have to find their own solutions to drug-related problems.
   ``I can see it happening and it's unfortunate,'' said Kevin B.
Zeese, director of the Washington-based Center for the Study of
Drug Policy, which advocates legalization of some drugs like
marijuana and cocaine. Zeese was a speaker at a conference last
week sponsored by the Washington Journalism Center.
   ``Casual use is declining. What is left is a hard-core group of
people who are heavily into drugs,'' said Charles R. Schuster,
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA is the
federal government's lead agency in researching drug abuse problems.
   Schuster said studies have shown that in 1985, an estimated 5.8
million Americans used cocaine at least once a month. By 1988, he
said, the number had decreased to about 2.9 million.
   At the same time, he said, the number of weekly users rose from
an estimated 650,000 to about 800,000, although he said he believed
those estimates are low.
   Studies have shown that the decline in drug use is primarily in
mostly white suburban America, Schuster noted, while use is on the
upswing in poor, predominantly black inner-city neighborhoods.
Conference speakers said, however, that differences are better
linked to socioeconomic status than race.
   Schuster said he worries that policy makers may lose concern
about illegal drugs if they're convinced that anti-drug efforts
have worked in middle-class communities.
   ``There is always that potential; the attitude may be out of
sight, out of mind,'' added Reggie Walton, a deputy to federal drug
policy coordinator William Bennett and a former District of
Columbia Superior Court judge.
   ``For a long time (illicit drug use) was perceived as an
inner-city, minority problem and it wasn't aggressively attacked,''
he said.
   But a federal Drug Enforcement Administration official said he
believes problems related to the inner-city drug trade will keep
public attention focused on drug abuse in both urban and outlying
communities.
   ``The issue of violence will keep this on the front burner,''
said David Westrate, DEA assistant administrator for operations.
   Walton said that while the drug problem appears to ``manifest
itself in its worse sense in our inner cities,'' it is simply
``covered up a lot better'' in suburbia, where parents can afford
private treatment programs.
   ``A lot of parents in inner cities do a tremendous job in
deterring their kids from drug use,'' he said.
   Drug abuse ``did not become a real issue in this country until
it affected middle- and upper-class families,'' added Joanne C.
Benson, principal of John H. Bain Elementary School in Capitol
Heights, Md., just outside Washington.
   Benson has been recognized for her efforts to rid the
neighborhood around the school of drug pushers and to get parents
involved in drug rehabilitation and community improvement projects.
   Benson said drug policy makers must make sure that no community
is forgotten, even those with little political clout like Capitol
Heights.

<TEXT>
   Five Mother's Days have passed since Rep.
Patricia Schroeder first advanced a plan guaranteeing job-protected
time off to workers with new babies or an illness in the family.
   The sixth could be a charm.
   This week, just before Mother's Day 1990, the Family and Medical
Leave Act is scheduled to come up on the House floor for the first
time.
   Is it an intrusive mandate that would dictate corporate
personnel policies, inhibit flexibility and deprive workers of
other benefits? That's what the influential business lobby contends.
   But supporters say they're asking lawmakers to consider the
plight of American families and simply make sure people don't lose
their jobs when they are needed at home.
   ``We're not talking about the M-word, mandates, here. We're
talking about the V-word, values,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J.
She said she's telling her colleagues: ``Don't give us lip service
about family values if you don't recognize them in this bill.''
   Under the family and medical leave act, employees would be
entitled to unpaid time off to care for newborn, newly adopted or
seriously ill children, to cope with personal health problems, and
to tend stricken spouses or parents.
   As Schroeder, D-Colo., introduced it five years ago, all
businesses employing more than five people would have had to offer
18-week leaves. In its present form, all businesses with fewer than
50 employees would be exempt and the companies would have to offer
12 weeks of unpaid leave.
   ``I obviously would much prefer to have something else,''
Schroeder said. ``But we have to act on it. We can't just keep
introducing it.''
   The business community says it cannot accept a federally
mandated benefit in any form. ``There can be no compromise on this
legislation,'' the National Federation of Independent Business told
Schroeder in a letter last week. ``Moreover, mandated leave is just
the first step toward 100 percent coverage and paid leave.''
   But House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said many
successful companies offer leaves and consider them investments in
their work force.
   ``In the modern world, more parents work and more children are
left without the kind of supervision and help they need,'' he said.
``Child care and family leave can begin to fill in those gaps.''
   Gephardt said he took advantage of his St. Louis law firm's
leave policy when his son had cancer years ago. Companies without
such arrangements put employees into a real bind, he said.
   ``You feel like a trapped animal,'' he said. ``You realize that
if you leave, you're likely to lose your job, and that's the last
thing you need to do at a time of tremendous expense and stress.''
   Supporters of the family leave bill range from the House
leadership to a coalition that includes feminist and church groups,
pediatricians and labor unions. A House vote is expected in
mid-week, and they predict they will prevail on a close vote and
send the bill to the Senate.
   Roukema said she has urged the Bush administration to avoid veto
threats before Congress completes action on the measure. She said
she is getting mixed White House signals on the bill's prospects:
``Some people say the administration is totally against all new
mandates. Others say, well, we'll see.''
   Bush, who espoused family values during the 1988 campaign, has
said he favors job-protected leave for new mothers, but says
employers should provide it voluntarily.
   ``It is voluntary and a lot of companies aren't doing it,''
Schroeder said.
   Roukema said she fears the issue could damage her party unless
Bush and her GOP colleagues change their minds.
   ``I'm very worried that this will be used against Republicans,''
Roukema said. ``Polls have demonstrated that Republicans ... are
not perceived to be responsive to the working family issue. And
what could be more of a defining issue than family and medical
leave? It defines where you stand on women, children, grandma and
grandpa.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Lawmakers Tackle Campaign Finance Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close observer may doubt Congress' sincerity
on issues such as the environment, abortion and the deficit. But
not on campaign finance reform.
   Many lawmakers sincerely want to reform their campaign opponents
out of contention.
   For the past two years, the idea of revamping the federal
campaign finance system has been at the top of the congressional
agenda.
   But so far there's been more heat than light from the 535
experts grappling with the issue from their seats in the Capitol.
   The Senate deadlocked repeatedly on the issue in 1988, and
agreement remains elusive today. House Republican and Democratic
leaders formed a task force on campaign reform in the wake of the
ethics-related resignation of former Speaker Jim Wright, and nearly
a year later it is stalled.
   There's little disagreement over the problem. Campaigns cost so
much that raising money for them is a full-time job, prone to
conflicts of interest and not leaving much time for legislating.
   But almost any solution favors one side over another.
   The main Democratic proposal would cap the total amount that
candidates may spend in a campaign. Republicans don't like the idea
because the Democrats get a lot of off-the-books help, primarily
from labor unions.
   The GOP would eliminate most donations from political action
committees, non-monetary help from labor and other groups, and give
the political parties a bigger role in House and Senate elections.
PACs give mightily to Democratic incumbents while the Republican
Party, with President Bush as chief fundraiser, can easily outspend
the Democratic Party.
   Some Democrats favor public financing of campaigns, perhaps
through an income tax checkoff, but that proposal is anathema to
most conservatives.
   The differences between the parties are so sharp that in the
House, Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill., recently agreed to hold off action until later in
the spring in hopes the Senate can find some common ground.
   It is widely expected that the House's majority Democrats will
muscle their bill past Republican objections, but the GOP members
will get a chance to vote on their alternative. That way, both
sides can go home to the voters and say they supported ``reform.''
   The Senate could do the same thing, but probably not as tidily
and with more acrimony. If pushed hard enough, perhaps by the
continuing scandal over campaign donations from executives from
failed savings and loans, it's possible a bill could emerge.
   There are a few areas of possible agreement _ for example,
mandated discounts for television campaign advertising.
   But even proposals that would hit incumbent candidates from both
parties equally can be sensitive, such as the proposal by Senate
Republicans to place tough restrictions on taxpayer-financed
mailings by senators in an election year.
   The congressional ``frank'' is one of the big advantages
incumbents have over their challengers. The minority Republicans
are looking to make all of Congress more vulnerable, to increase
their own chances of taking over.
   But House Speaker Foley recently refused to consider even the
moderate step of disclosing publicly how much each House member
spends on mass mailings. Foley said the public has repeatedly said
in polls that it wants to hear from elected officials more often,
not less.
   It's too early to rule out a significant revamping of campaign
laws. But resistance to any proposed changes must be expected
because those 535 experts on Capitol Hill have proven they can
master the current system.
   Despite grumbling about its burdens, it's still the devil they
know.

<HEAD>Teddy Roosevelt: Bold President, Lousy Speller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theodore Roosevelt boldly shaped the powers of
the presidency but wasn't too busy for nightly pillow fights with
his kids, according to a White House lecturer's fond remembrance.
   President Bush and 200 guests listened raptly to the lecture on
the ``bold, noisy, irrepressibly energetic'' 26th president on
Sunday by prize-winning biographer David McCullough.
   Bush called Roosevelt ``a favorite of mine, a man who helped
shape the modern presidency, the inexhaustible T.R.''
   The audience included congressional leaders who met afterward
with Bush to discuss future budget negotiations.
   Bush smiled broadly at House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., when
McCullough read from one letter in which Roosevelt complained he
felt ``like a stewed owl'' after dealing with members of Congress
all day.
   Roosevelt's solution to such frustrations was vigorous physical
activity, including workouts with Japanese wrestlers that left him
bruised from head to toe.
   He once marched two British visitors right through a duck pond
on the White House grounds that fortunately turned out to be only
three feet deep.
   Roosevelt, only 42 when he became president in 1901 upon the
assassination of William McKinley, was the first tennis-playing
president, as well as the first to ride in an automobile, fly in a
plane, sail on a submarine and venture abroad.
   He dispensed with the formality of being addressed as ``Your
Excellency'' and paid no heed to public opinion.
   McCullough quoted the Rough Rider as saying, ``I don't know what
they think. I just know what they ought to think.''
   When Congress objected to his sending 16 U.S. battleships on a
tour around the world, Roosevelt sent the fleet off anyway.
   ``Theodore determined that there was enough money in the
Treasury to send them halfway. So he said, `I'll send them halfway
and Congress can decide whether to appropriate the money to bring
them back again,''' said McCullough, author of ``Mornings on
Horseback,'' an account of Roosevelt's early years.
   Roosevelt was a prime participant in ``rampant, wild pillow
fights almost every night'' with his six children, the writer said.
   He went on a real-life safari after leaving office in 1909, but
his reluctance once to fire upon a small bear led a New York
toymaker to conceive a novelty item: the ``teddy'' bear.
   He set aside millions of acres for national forests and parks
and ``did more for conservation than any president before and very
few since,'' McCullough said.
   He renovated a ``somewhat creepy'' White House and scuttled
plans to fill the mansion with offices and make the president live
elsewhere.
   ``He couldn't spell worth anything,'' but read a book each night
and could quote from them years later, the author said.
   He created a stir in the South by inviting Booker T. Washington
of Tuskegee Institute as the first black dinner guest at the White
House.
   That so delighted pianist Scott Joplin that he promptly wrote
``The Strenuous Life Rag'' in Roosevelt's honor. McCullough
interrupted his narrative and had a pianist play the piece for the
East Room audience.
   ``His words, many of them, written or spoken so long ago, still
have enormous validity today,'' said McCullough.
   Among Roosevelt's sayings: ``This country will not be a
permanently good place for any of us to live unless we make it a
reasonably good place for all of us to live.'''

<HEAD>Report: Evidence Missing, Witnesses Abroad in Jesuit Slay Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diary that could help convict a Salvadoran
army colonel in the slayings of six Jesuit priests and two women in
1989 has vanished, The New York Times reported today.
   The loss of the colonel's diary and the transfers overseas of
four soldiers who may be important witnesses have greatly weakened
the case against Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno, the
newspaper said.
   The developments also may hurt efforts to prove that other high
military officials were involved in or tried to cover up the
killings, the Times quoted unidentified Salvadoran judicial
officials as saying.
   Six priests, their cook and her daughter were slain Nov. 16 in a
pre-dawn attack at the Jesuit-run Central American University,
which lies just outside the capital, San Salvador.
   Benavides and seven other officials were chargd with the
slayings in January.
   Critical evidence, including the diary, has disappeared, the
Times said.
   Also, four soldiers who were stationed at a military school run
by Benavides have been transferred abroad to study, and two other
witnesses failed to appear to testify, the Times said.
   The only evidence so far against Benavides, the highest ranking
official ever charged in a human rights case in the country,
consists of statements by some of the seven other officials charged
in the case. In El Salvador, a defendant's statement can't be used
against a co-defendant, the paper said.
   Investigators believe the colonel's diary lists his activities
and the meetings he attended before the killings, the Times said.
   Another missing piece of evidence is a log from the military
school that the colonel headed. The tribunal investigating the
slayings was told that the log was lost. It might show who entered
and left the school the night of the killings, the report said.
   The four soldiers who were transferred also may have been able
to say who was at the campus that night. They were responsible for
logging the names of anyone entering or leaving the campus.

<TEXT>
   He's 12 years old and his goal is not to set
video game scoring records but to be the youngest doctor in the
world.
   Meet third-year pre-medical student Balamurati Krishna Ambati, a
prodigy who wants to graduate medical school before he turns 18.
   While the would-be ``Doogie Howser'' is causing some nervousness
at New York University, Friedrich Ulfers, director of the
Presidential Scholars program, which awarded him a full
scholarship, is pleased with his pace.
   ``What if we had told Mozart he was too precocious?'' Ulfers
said.
   The youngster mastered calculus at age 4 and described himself
as ``a prodigy with a purpose'' on his college application.
   He said that after learning that an Israeli, at 18, was the
youngest medical school graduate, he decided that he wanted to beat
that record.
   A reference to the TV program ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' about a
teen-age doctor, doesn't draw much of a response from Bala, as he
is known. He's never seen the show, preferring the news,
``Jeopardy'' and ``Star Trek, the Next Generation.''
   He was born in India and was 3 when his parents moved to
Buffalo. As his father, Ambati Murati, an industrial engineer, and
his mother, Gomathi Rao, a mathematics teacher, moved around the
country, Bala skipped grades and excelled.
   Some of his professors don't share the enthusiasm of Bala and
his family.
   ``I worry that it is the parents that are pushing,'' said
physics professor Leposava Vuskovic. ``It is one thing to perform
and be creative, but he just wants to get the degree.''
   The boy's father said he has had to fight school administrators
to get Bala skipped to higher grades. And the idea of a 14-year-old
medical school applicant doesn't sit too well in some quarters.
   ``I think questions might be legitimately raised about his
emotional maturity,'' said Dr. Andrew Frantz, chairman of the
admissions committee at Columbia University's medical school. ``Why
does he need to? Why not wait?''
   The boy's father won't listen to that kind of talk.
   ``As we have set this goal, even if he only gets into the worst
medical school in New York, we will go for it,'' Murati said.

   Sugar growers contributed more than $3.3
million to congressional campaigns between 1983 and 1989 as part of
an effort to keep U.S. sugar prices artificially high, a consumer
group says.
   ``U.S. sugar support policies artificially keep the price of
sugar so high that consumers have spent billions more than they
should have,'' Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said Sunday.
   Officials for the sugar industry acknowledge the campaign
contributions but disputed the contention that consumers are paying
too much for their product.
   ``The program keeps prices stable,'' said Joe Terrell, spokesman
for the American Sugar Alliance. ``Consumers in this country pay on
average about what is paid in developed countries worldwide, or
less in some cases.''
   Critics contend that the system of price supports and quotas for
sugar is among the most blatantly protectionist of any U.S. farm
programs.
   Many foreign suppliers are Third World countries whose economies
rise and fall dramatically depending their access to the U.S.
market.

   A business group is telling political leaders
in Japan and the United States to go to work solving their own
problems at home rather than blame each other for trade friction.
   The Commission on U.S.-Japan Relations for the 21st Century,
including corporate chiefs whose firms have prospered in Japan,
said some of the home-grown problems in the United States are the
federal budget deficit and the American emphasis on quick corporate
profits.
   The two countries should ``acknowledge that there is blame
enough to go around, get on with expanding the horizons of
cooperation, while working through the disputes that frustrate
both,'' said a report issued by the commission last week.
   Besides protectionism and economic decline, a breakdown of
U.S.-Japanese cooperation could have serious political
consequences, said commission Chairman Edson W. Spencer, former
chief executive officer of Honeywell Corp., chairman of the
U.S.-Japan Business Council and board chairman of the Ford
Foundation.

   Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam, says Muslims are fielding candidates for public office
because current officeholders in the Washington area have been
ineffective in dealing with drugs, crime and other social problems.
   Farrakhan's statements Saturday angered some Congressional
leaders and black politicians who say chances of building a
coalition have been hurt.
   ``I don't think anyone can go around and make a blanket
indictment on black leadership,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
``These people who are so apt to question black leadership, where
were they 25 years ago when we marched across the bridge to Selma?''
   Farrakhan made the comments at a local housing project where
Muslims two years ago launched a local antidrug program that rid
the neighborhood of open-air drug markets.
   Abdul Alim Muhammad, Farrakhan's national spokesman and
executive director of the neighborhood antidrug program, said he
will seek the Fifth District U.S. House seat from Prince Georges
County, a Maryland suburb of Washington.
   George X Cure, a legal adviser to a group of Muslims who have
fought drug trafficking through an organization called Dopebusters,
said he will run for the District of Columbia's non-voting seat in
the House.

<HEAD>JCS Head Says Pentagon Review Could Cut Budget by 25 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comprehensive review of U.S. defenses could
permit spending cuts of 20 to 25 percent, the nation's top military
officer was quoted as saying today.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said American weapons systems, personnel levels, training practices
and military strategy should be transformed to adjust to the
much-diminished Soviet threat, the Washington Post reported.
   ``We know we have to get smaller,'' Powell said in the Post
interview. ``We can go down considerably.''
   But Powell, an Army general who served as national security
adviser in the Reagan administration, said some congressional
critics were proposing to put the defense budget ``in too steep a
dive.''
   The aim of a top-to-bottom review would be to determine the
minimum forces the United States needs, he said.
   ``There is a base level below which you can't go ... because we
are a superpower with worldwide interests,'' the newspaper quoted
him as saying.
   Powell said he did not want to spell out his views for future
budgets, but said he believed a ``fundamental break point'' would
occur ``somewhere in the neighborhood of maybe a 20 to 25 percent
reduction from where we are now'' in both force size and military
spending, the Post reported.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed cutting the current
$291 defense billion budget by 2 percent each year through 1997,
after taking into account the effects of inflation.
   Powell told the Post that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political and military changes mean the United States
no longer needs to see the Soviet Union as ``a real and present
danger who's coming at me tomorrow.''
   Instead of seeing the Soviets as the enemy, Powell said, ``I
want to deal straight up with them as businessmen ... like two real
estate lawyers closing a deal. I want title insurance, I want a
termite inspector.''

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Secretly Bought Soviet Weapons From Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the past decade, Communist Romania sold
advanced Soviet weaponry to the United States in secret deals worth
more than $40 million, according to a published report.
   Two brothers of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu served as brokers for
the deals, and 20 percent of the money wound up in Swiss bank
accounts controlled by the Ceausescu family, The Washington Post
reported on Sunday.
   The paper based its account on unnamed intelligence sources, and
said the arms purchases were of immense value to U.S. intelligence.
   The Romanian operation was interrupted when Ceausescu was
overthrown and executed, the Post said.
   A few days later, one of the brothers, Marin Ceausescu, was
found hanged in the basement of the Romanian trade mission in
Vienna, which he headed. The other, Lt. Gen. Ilie Ceausescu, deputy
defense minister, is under arrest in the Romanian capital Bucharest.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, speaking with reporters
en route back to Washington from Europe on Sunday, said ``I'm not
aware of the story. I'm not aware of it (the arrangement).''
   Stephen Hart, a deputy White House spokesman, declined to
discuss the report.
   The Post reported that ``the Ceausescu connection'' was part of
a larger, $250 million operation by the CIA and U.S. military to
buy weapons and technology from the military in Eastern European
countries allied with the Soviets.
   Last year's pro-democracy upheaval in Eastern Europe has
disrupted the broader operation, but not stopped it, the newspaper
said.
   From Romania alone, the acquisitions included the latest version
of an antiaircraft system called the Shilka; mobile rocket
launchers modified and improved by the Romanians; and radar systems
used by Soviet antiaircraft weapons, the newspaper said.
   ``The potential value of these things is almost incalculable,''
an unidentified U.S. intelligence officer was quoted as saying.
``The only way you can truly unlock the secrets of your
adversaries' weapons is to physically have them.''
   Nicolae Ceausescu was not personally involved in the dozen or so
sales, the Post said, but it quoted American officials as saying
they believed the sales could not have taken place without the
dictator's tacit approval.

   Richard Cooksie tried to walk home over the
weekend but turned back. He would have had to swim the last block.
   The 63-year-old retired construction worker found himself back
at a temporary shelter Sunday night, passing his time making mental
lists of what possessions he might be able to save from the Trinity
River flood that has swamped his home since Thursday.
   It's not the first time Cooksie has been forced out by high
water. Flooding devastated his previous home in Rochester Park, a
suburb southeast of Dallas, last summer.
   ``Everything I had was totally destroyed, for two years in a
row,'' he lamented. ``I had moved from where I lived before. It was
higher. I thought it was high ground. I moved two blocks up, but
the same thing happened.''
   The only thing Cooksie managed to grab when he discovered water
from the rain-swollen river was rising rapidly early Thursday was
one pair of pants and a few changes of underwear, he said.
   Flood stage is 30 feet and the Trinity stood at 43.8 feet in
Dallas early today. More than 400 people have been forced from
their homes.
   Cooksie, who said he depends entirely on monthly Social Security
checks, was one of the last flood victims to remain at the Exline
Recreation Center, which has served as Dallas' main shelter for
flood victims.
   Many others have found lodging with relatives or have been given
vouchers for hotel rooms, authorities said.
   Officials expected no more than 10 people to spend Sunday night
at the shelter, down from more than 50 the night before.
   Rickey Henderson, a 30-year-old unemployed handyman staying at
the shelter, said he had managed to make it back to Rochester Park
over the weekend. His gamble of storing all his furniture in
someone else's apartment on the second floor had paid off, he said.
It was still there.
   Police reported at least two looters were arrested for wading
into the flooded areas and floating stolen goods out using inner
tubes and trash cans.
   ``It's not bad here, and it's not good, but it's better than
being nowhere,'' Henderson said of life at the shelter. ``We watch
TV here, we go outside, we walk kids around, we play basketball, or
something, but mostly we just talk to other people.''
   Henderson said he would like to move to an area where floods are
something people only watch on TV, but he can't afford to move away
from the federally subsidized housing project where he lives along
with his mother and two nieces.
   ``They say it's not going to be until 1993 until they can stop
flooding down there,'' he said. ``I would like to move to a better
location, but I don't know how.''

   Investigators are picking through the
wreckage of a U.S.-manned cargo plane in efforts to determine why
it crashed into a residential neighborhood, ripping through homes
and killing 19 people.
   Relatives of victims in the DC-6 crash worked with officials
Sunday to identify charred bodies. The crash had caused propane
tanks used for cooking to catch fire, hampering rescue efforts.
   Three U.S. crew members and 16 people on the ground were killed
when the Aerial Transit Co. plane, carrying snow peas and cloth to
Miami, crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday afternoon.
   Twenty people were injured and 16 houses damaged in two densely
populated neighborhoods in southwestern Guatemala City.
   Efforts to identify victims were suspended Sunday night but were
expected to resume today, officials at the morgue at San Vicente
Hospital said.
   All but the tail of the plane was removed from the site Sunday,
and investigators began examining the wreckage for clues to the
cause of the crash.
   The plane went down about five minutes after taking off from the
city's international airport.
   ``They apparently had some problem with one engine, and as they
were making the go-around, apparently it crashed,'' Tom Stocks,
vice president of Aerial Transit, said at the company's base in
Miami. He said there were no problems when the plane left Miami on
Saturday for El Salvador and Guatemala.
   He said he expected a U.S. investigation of the crash.
   The U.S. crew members were Capt. Joseph Babody of Detroit;
co-pilot J. Theodore of Palm Beach, Fla.; and engineer Dallas White
of Miami Springs, Fla., he said.

   Tens of thousands of people, some
chanting ``Greater Romania,'' streamed across the Soviet border to
visit their ethnic Romanian brethren after the frontier was opened
for the first time in decades.
   For six hours on Sunday, Romanians needed no visas to cross into
the Soviet republic of Moldavia, which was known as Bessarabia and
was part of Romania before the Soviets seized it 50 years ago.
   ``Let's cover the wound of Moldavia with flowers ... and see our
forgotten brothers again,'' said an appeal published in Faclia, the
local daily in the Soviet republic's capital of Kishenev.
   Demands for the return of Bessarabia have grown strongly on both
sides of the border since the December overthrow and execution of
hard-line Communist Nicolae Ceausescu in a popular revolution.
   Political reforms have allowed free expression of nationalist
yearnings in the Soviet Union and the nationalist fervor was
tangible Sunday as Romanians streamed through eight temporarily
opened border crossings into Soviet Moldavia.
   At least 40,000 exuberant, flag-waving people poured over
Ungheni bridge, throwing flowers into the Prut River that forms the
frontier. Many carried Romanian-language books and records to their
kin in the Soviet Union.
   When the bridge became crowded, some people decided not to wait
and swam the river instead.
   Other groups of people stood on the banks of the Prut, heatedly
arguing the question of possible reunification.
   ``This `bridge of flowers' is our first crack in the wall, for
Bessarabia was always Romanian,'' said 24-year-old electrician
Vasile Haciu.
   Local inhabitants said hundreds of thousands of people flooded
through the border crossings into Soviet Moldavia, but no official
figures were available.
   The border opening occurred at the initiative of the Popular
Front of Moldavia and other cultural organizations, official and
independent, on both sides of the river.
   Soviet sources said the request was approved April 17 by
Moldavia's Parliament. It was not known whether Moscow gave its
formal approval.
   Soviet citizens were not allowed to cross into Romania, but
small groups from Kishinev sneaked in.
   The Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and the north of Bukovina
in 1940 after signing the Hitler-Stalin pact with Nazi Germany. The
two regions were then joined as Soviet Moldavia, and for decades _
under Stalinist leaders in both countries _ talk of reunification
was taboo.
   But with the dramatic political changes in Romania and the
Soviet Union, people on both sides of the border are now talking of
increased ties.
   Soviet Moldavians last year were finally permitted to restore
the Latin script for their language, which is virtually identical
to that of Romania. Stalin imposed the Russian Cyrillic script on
the area.
   ``The tragedy of the Romanian people started with the
Hitler-Stalin pact, when unjust frontiers were imposed,'' said
Gheorghe Ghimpu, head of the official Popular Front of Moldavia, a
Communist-run umbrella organization.
   Many fear that talk of reuniting Romania and Soviet Moldavia
will exacerbate political tensions in the Soviet Union, where
Moscow is already feuding with secessionist republics in the
Baltics.
   The interim government in Bucharest that took over after
Ceausescu's executed has not explicitly rejected the idea of
reunification. But it has offered no specific initiatives.

   Pope John Paul II says he will not visit Cuba
this year, despite a Vatican announcement last month that the
pontiff might travel to the Communist country in December.
   ``It seems that this project will not be mature for the end of
the year,'' John Paul told reporters Sunday on the papal flight
from Rome to Mexico City.
   ``The invitations have arrived,'' the pontiff said, but the
Cuban bishops, the Vatican and the government of President Fidel
Castro have yet to agree on a date. Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said December had been only one of several possible dates
for a trip.
   John Paul has visited every country in Central and South America
during his pontificate, but he has never been able to visit Cuba.

<HEAD>Dollar Dips, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar eased against the Japanese yen today,
sending share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soaring.
   The dollar closed at 157.80 yen, down 0.75 yen from Wednesday's
close of 158.55 yen. The market was closed Thursday and Friday for
holidays.
   It opened at 158.36 yen and rose no higher than 158.37 yen
before falling on news reports that financial authorities of seven
major industrialized nations had agreed to correct the current
level of exchange rates.
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven _
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada _ agreed Sunday that the present level ``may still have
undesirable consequences for the global adjustment process,'' David
Mulford, the U.S. Treasury's undersecretary for international
affairs, told a news conference.
   Now, however, ``market players are sitting on the sidelines
ahead of the U.S. government bond auction that starts Tuesday,''
said Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 483.81 points on Wednesday, rose another
782.63 points, or 2.59 percent, closing at 30,956.27.
   Securities dealers said investors were encouraged by the strong
showing of stock markets around the world and the strengthening of
the Japanese yen.
   ``The yen's rise gave investors incentive to buy domestic
market-oriented shares,'' said a dealer with a major Japanese
brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said construction, real estate and mining-related shares were
main beneficiaries of the yen's rise today.
   But the rising yen worked against export-oriented issues such as
electricity and automobile shares, which had led the Tokyo market
in recent weeks when the yen was falling.
   Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer with Nikko Securities, said the
strong showing of foreign stock markets, especially New York's,
also encouraged investors in Tokyo.
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.19
points last Friday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 86.29, up 0.37 points from
85.92 points on Wednesday. The yield fell to 7.310 percent from
7.390 percent.

<NOTE>Eds: Arraignment scheduled for noon EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OREM, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retarded man whose release to a group home
after three decades in a mental hospital spurred a public outcry
was behind bars today for investigation of theft and attempted
burglary.
   Bernt Murphy, 52, was jailed Sunday following a report of an
attempted break-in Saturday night at a home about seven blocks from
where he lives, said Detective Gerald Nielsen. Murphy awaited
arraignment today.
   The incident renewed the outrage of neighbors who have argued
that retarded men with histories of violence should not be housed
in a residential area.
   Murphy spent 31 years in the Utah State Hospital after being
arrested in the 1957 rape of a 5-year-old girl. During police
interviews, he confessed to killing a 23-year-old woman.
   He was judged incompetent to stand trial for rape and was never
charged in the slaying.
   In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court ordered his release after
finding Murphy had been mistakenly ruled insane. He moved into the
group home in January, and within days neighbors stormed a City
Council meeting to demand his removal.
   In the weekend incident, the house was not entered, but the
homeowner's dog was stolen and trophy bearing Murphy's name was
discovered outside the back door and a pair of his sunglasses was
found in the animal's doghouse, Nielsen said.
   Witnesses reported seeing Murphy with the dog, police said.
   Nielsen said it was unlikely, based on the evidence, that Murphy
had been framed. He would not elaborate.
   Murphy had called police at least twice Thursday and Friday to
report he was being harassed by boys, but officers found no
indication of trouble, Nielsen said.
   The group home houses three other men under a restrictive permit
issued by the City Council.
   Murphy's attorney filed a complaint with the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, charging that the protests and the
city requirements violated Murphy's rights. HUD is investigating.

<HEAD>Czechoslovaks Belatedly Thank Americans for Liberating City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PILSEN, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-five years after Gen. George
Patton's 3rd Army drove the Nazis from this city, its Czech
residents finally had another chance to thank the Americans.
   The Communists who ruled Czechoslovakia until November had
written the American liberation of Pilsen out of their history
books.
   ``Finally the day has come when we can express our gratitude and
thanks publicly to all those persecuted, forgotten or erased from
world history,'' President Vaclav Havel told up to 40,000 people
who packed the city's central square Sunday for Liberation Day
celebrations.
   ``Many of them ... did not live to see this well-deserved
recognition by our country,'' said the former dissident playwright.
   But scores of U.S. veterans did take part in the weekend
celebrations in this western Bohemian city, which was for the first
time the site of the main Czechoslovak observance of the end of
World War II.
   In past years, the celebrations took place in Prague, the
capital, and highlighted only the Soviet role in the country's
liberation.
   Under the hard-line Communist rulers toppled in last fall's
peaceful revolution, the official position was that only the Soviet
Red Army liberated Czechoslovakia in 1945.
   Czech revelers drove restored World War II jeeps through Pilsen
and wore American Army uniforms.
   It was a moving experience for the many elderly American
veterans who took part. Many were making their first trip back.
   ``They stole our hearts then, and they are doing it again
today,'' said Bobby Capps, of Birmingham, Ala., now retired to Lake
Alfred, Fla., who was a member of the 396th Field Artillery.
   ``You can't describe how much love there is.''
   The holiday brought tens of thousands of people to Pilsen from
across western Czechoslovakia to drink the famous Pilsener beer,
eat sausages, hear speeches and indulge in a festival of Americana,
including country and western bands, swing music and a U.S. film
festival featuring ``Patton,'' starring George C. Scott.
   People displayed U.S. and Czechoslovak flags in the windows of
their homes and flew the Stars and Stripes from car antennae.
   ``This is a dream, something genuinely unbelievable,'' said
Czech singer Pavel Bobek, who recalled visiting Pilsen as a
7-year-old and seeing the U.S. troops.
   During a ceremony at city hall, a plaque commemorating the U.S.
liberation was remounted. It had been taken down by Stalinist
authorities at the height of the Cold War in 1951.
   ``All Americans thank Czechoslovakia for putting American
soldiers back in their true place in history,'' U.S. Ambassador
Shirley Temple Black, the former child film star, said during the
ceremony.
   Earlier in the day, Havel spoke at a ceremony in the small town
of Rokycany, where a plaque was unveiled honoring the troops of the
U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division, who rolled into town in
their jeeps on May 5, 1945.
   Rokycany is near the demarcation line where U.S. troops halted
their eastward advance in World War II's closing days as part of
the Yalta Conference agreement, which allowed the Red Army to
occupy much of Eastern Europe.
   Under the agreement, U.S. troops were prevented from pushing on
to liberate Prague, just 50 miles away.
   In 1949, the Communists established full control and set up a
Soviet-style state.

   Molten rock from Kilauea Volcano flowed
to the ocean's edge, and officials warned of hazardous steam clouds
when the lava plunges into the sea.
   The seven-year eruption has destroyed 138 homes in Kalapana and
elsewhere on the volcano's flank, 60 of them since April 4.
   The unpredictable flow has encircled this tiny coastal town, and
scientists said lava could overrun what's left of the community
within days. All residents have left, some of them bringing their
houses with them.
   Highway 130 is littered with displaced houses and the Roman
Catholic Star of the Sea Church, which have been temporarily moved
out of harm's way.
   One arm of the flow pooled at the base of sand dunes near Harry
K. Brown State Park, said Bruce Butts, deputy administrator for
Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   It was just a matter of time until enough lava amassedto spill
over the sand and into the ocean, he said.
   Hot lava mixing with salt water produces steam clouds, known as
laze, that contain hydrochloric acid and other hazardous chemicals.
   ``Our main concern is the trade winds,'' said Civil Defense
spokesman Bruce Butts. ``As long as there are trade winds, the laze
will be blown away.''
   The Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church and Kalapana Store
and Drive-In at the heart of the community were standing Sunday,
but Butts said the lava threatened both.
   Lava felled two more houses Sunday and overran the park, forcing
the Civil Defense command center to move to higher ground at a
papaya grove.
   Gov. John Waihee asked that the town and other coastal
communities inundated by lava over the years be declared a federal
disaster area. Waihee estimated damage at $61 million.

   Bob Castleberry always wanted to be mayor
but couldn't afford a non-paying job.
   That is, until he won $10 million in the Publishers Clearing
House Sweepstakes.
   Castleberry, 60, beat two-term incumbent Ray Stephens 50 percent
to 45 percent to become mayor Saturday.
   Castleberry picked up his sweepstakes bonanza a year ago. After
announcing his candidacy, he retired in January from his sales job
in Denton, 35 miles from Dallas.
   He had eyed the mayor's race for years. His father served on the
City Council from 1929-30 and again in the early 1950s.
   ``I grew up watching my father giving everything to the
community,'' Castleberry said. ``Now I just want to do what I can.''
   The $10 million comes in installments. He got $500,000 last year
and gets $250,000 a year for the next 27 years, when a lump sum of
$2 million is due.

   When is a condom too old for safe sex?
   The Robert Wood Johnson Medical School is recruiting 40 couples
for a nationwide study that may provide an answer.
   Under inspection are condoms up to 10 years old found in Third
World warehouses that are part of a U.S. contraceptive distribution
program.
   Sandra J. Gonzalez, a program development specialist at the
medical school, said each couple will be given six condoms, brand
new to 10 years old.
   The couples must have intercourse two or more times a week using
the condoms and report back on which, if any, are defective.
   Only couples 18 and over, in which the women also are using
birth control pills or intrauterine devices, will be accepted, she
said. Each couple will receive $60.
   The $30,000 study is sponsored by Family Health International of
Research Triangle Park, N.C., a non-profit agency that concentrates
on family planning issues in Third World countries. About 150
couples nationwide are expected to participate.
   Condoms are said to have a shelf life of about five years, but
that may not hold true under conditions such as a warehouse in the
tropics, said Robin Foldesy, director of materials technology for
Family Health International.
   ``There is probably some sort of threshold,'' he said. ``We
don't know where that threshold exists.''

   Most of the nation enjoyed fair weather early today, while a
cold front dropped temperatures into the 30s and 40s in the
Northwest.
   Showers were forecast today for the Northeast, Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming and northern Utah. Thunderstorms were forecast for southern
Texas.
   Flooding continued along the Trinity River in Texas, the
Arkansas River in Arkansas and on reservoirs in Oklahoma. Low-lying
neighborhoods were sandbagged in North Little Rock, Ark., and the
Red Cross has sheltered about 1,500 evacuees since heavy rain,
flooding and tornadoes swept across North Texas a week ago.
   Temperatures fell into the 30s and 40s early today in Montana,
Idaho, Seattle and Washington.
   On Sunday, a warm front sent temperatures soaring into the
mid-80s across western portions of the Dakotas and near 90 degrees
over eastern Montana. Temperatures also were unseasonably high over
portions of Florida, including a record for the date of 93 degrees
in West Palm Beach.
   Elsewhere Sunday, showers and thunderstorms developed over much
of New York, central and northern New England, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia, eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina,
northern Georgia, central and southern Florida, southwest Utah and
Washington state.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 106 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Official: Emergency Brake May Have Caused Train Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said today they were
investigating the possibility of brake-tampering on a steam train
that was hit in the rear by an an express train, leaving at least
six people dead and more than 100 injured.
   Rescue teams were still cutting at the wreckage of the steam and
intercity express trains today, fearing more people were trapped.
   The passenger trains crashed Sunday night near the hamlet of
Brooklyn, 25 miles north of Sydney as the old-fashioned steam
engine, carrying about 300 people from a jazz festival, struggled
up a steep gradient.
   The electric train was carrying about 100 people on two decks,
en route to Sydney from Newcastle.
   New South Wales Transport Minister Bruce Baird said it was
possible an emergency brake had been on set on a car of the steam
train, which had been trying to pick up speed before it was hit.
   ``There is evidence the hand-operated brake in the third
(passenger) carriage was on,'' Baird said.
   Investigators were also looking at why the express was not aware
of the steam train's presence on the track, which has a signal
system.
   The crash site is surrounded by dense bushland, and rescue
workers had to drive down a dirt track to reach it. When they
arrived, they found debris from the trains scattered over a
100-yard area.
   Police said six of the 106 people injured were in critical
condition.
   One survivor, Richard Stohr, said the steam train appeared to
have trouble getting up the hill.
   He said the electric train seemed to be trying to pick up speed
to tackle the hill when it emerged from a tunnel and crashed into
the other train.
   ``This woman just flew past me _ just sailed past,'' he said.
``I think she was killed.''
   Australia's worst rail disaster killed 83 people when a crowded
commuter train derailed and hit a bridge at Granville, in Sydney's
western suburbs, in January 1977.

   The FBI is warning churches in Arkansas
to be on the lookout for mail bombs.
   FBI agent Charles Williams sent letters to church administrators
of several denominations urging them to be wary of any unsolicited
packages with a fictitious North Carolina return address that might
be rigged to explode when opened.
   Authorities have said two mail bombs that exploded in a Texas
church in January and at the Christian Broadcasting Network in
Virginia last month were sent from Bladen County, N.C.
   The FBI declined to elaborate on what prompted Williams' warning.
   Margaret Ault, secretary to United Methodist Church Bishop
Richard D. Wilke, said the bishop sent about 650 warning letters to
every United Methodist church in the state Saturday.
   ``It's spooky enough as it is,'' said Dr. Merle Allison Johnson,
pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in Little Rock.
   At the Cathedral of St. Andrew, the Rev. Francis Malone said
Roman Catholic Bishop Andrew McDonald sent letters to all Catholic
institutions in the state.
   A bomb exploded in the 10,000-member interdominational Lakewood
Church in northeast Houston in late January. One person was injured.
   On April 27, a bomb in a package addressed to the Rev. Pat
Robertson at the Christian Broadcasting Co. in Virginia Beach, Va.,
exploded in the mailroom when it was opened by a security guard.
The guard was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds in one leg.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower in Calm Trading, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was lower in Europe late this morning
as a bank holiday in Britain sharply reduced trading.
   Gold was slightly higher in Zurich.
   Traders said that although the dollar was down, trading was calm
and the U.S. currency was showing signs of steadying after its
sharp sell-off Friday afternoon.
   That sell-off came in response to surprisingly weak U.S.
unemployment figures, which showed the jobless rate rising to 5.4
percent in April from 5.2 percent in March.
   A dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt said the momentum for a
lower dollar had been building up for several weeks and that the
U.S. unemployment report was only the trigger.
   Dealers said a key reason for the dollar's weakness was positive
news for the West German mark, including last week's accord on
details of German monetary union.
   ``The clouds that had been hanging over the D-mark are suddenly
gone,'' said a dealer at a West German bank. ``It is safe to buy
the mark again.''
   One trader in Milan said the meeting of finance ministers from
the seven major industrialized nations in Washington on Sunday
turned out to be a ``non-event'' for foreign exchange markets.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 157.80 yen. Later, in Europe,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 157.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6600 West German marks, down from 1.6710
   _1.4370 Swiss francs, down from 1.4435
   _5.5760 French francs, down from 5.6060
   _1.8665 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8782
   _1,217.50 Italian lire, down from 1,224.50
   _1.1620 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630
   In Europe, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6645, compared with $1.6595 late Friday in London.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $371.70 a troy ounce, up
from $371.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 34 cents to close at a bid
$373.10.

   Asian-American groups are demanding Newsday
columnist Jimmy Breslin's resignation over a racist,
expletive-filled newsroom tirade against a reporter of Korean
descent who criticized his column.
   In the outburst Friday outside Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh's presence, the
61-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist called the reporter
``slant-eyed.'' He also said, ``She's a yellow cur. Let's make it
racial.''
   Breslin apologized to Newsday staffers Friday in an internal
computer message that read in part: ``I am no good and once again I
can prove it. ... I am sorry. I said things I shouldn't have said.
The racial and sexual insults I spewed are never appropriate.''
   Helen Zia, president of the New York chapter of the
Asian-American Journalists Association, said the apology was ``very
flip.'' On Sunday, Zia's group joined the Coalition Against
Anti-Asian Violence and the Organization of Asian Women in
demanding Breslin resign or be fired, and that he publicly
apologize to Yuh.
   In his column today, Breslin wrote that ``it is absolutely nuts
to say that I am bigoted against a young woman from anywhere,
including a young woman who is Asian.''
   ``Rage is the only quality that has kept me, or anybody I ever
studied, writing newspaper columns,'' he added. ``I can control the
rage in my writing, which is what I get paid for. I do not control
it when I'm shouting off the written record.''
   Newsday spokeswoman Chiara Coletti said the paper plans no
further action against Breslin, who writes about New York City in
hard-bitten, streetwise fashion and covered the Son of Sam case in
1977 for the Daily News. He won a Pulitzer for commentary in 1986.
   His remarks were reported by the Daily News and in a letter of
complaint to Newsday managers signed by 46 members of the paper's
staff. The columnist's apology to the staff came after a computer
reprimand from editor Don Forst calling his comments ``offensive
and inexcusable.''
   ``It proves that racism comes in all kinds of packaging,'' said
Yuh, a 25-year-old native of Chicago. ``You can encounter it
anywhere, from your colleagues, in the boardroom, from your
neighbors _ not necessarily people in a white sheet with baseball
bats.''
   Yuh said she never met Breslin or communicated with him before
she sent him an internal message complaining his Thursday column
was ``spewing sexism.''
   Breslin had written that he hated ``official women,'' including
his wife, City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, who he said devoted
too much of her time to government duties and not enough to the
home.
   Eldridge was quoted Sunday by the Daily News as saying her
husband ``doesn't believe what he wrote in his heart, but the way
he is, when he knows he's wrong, he lashes out. He just acts that
way.''
   Breslin said in today's New York Times that he was ``sorry the
vulgar language came out. You're supposed to know what you're
doing, but I don't.''

   President Roh Tae-woo warned today of
a nation on the brink of ``chaos'' but defiant militants stormed
his party's headquarters, firebombed one of its provincial offices
and battled police in several cities.
   In a nationally televised speech, Roh said a wave of strikes and
protests by militant workers and radical students were threatening
the social fabric and the economy.
   He said the government would guarantee a legal labor movement
but ``will deal strongly with illegal labor disputes or collective
actions with political purposes.'' He did not elaborate.
   But even as the president spoke, 21 radicals yelling ``Down with
Roh Tae-woo!'' stormed governing party headquarters and held it for
10 minutes before being driven out. About 50 people fled the
building coughing and choking as police firing tear gas battled
students on a stairway, witnesses said.
   Radicals barricaded themselves inside a third-floor office,
broke the windows and threw firebombs down on the police while
shouting anti-government slogan, witnesses said. Police and news
reports said five students were injured and all 21 who took part in
the attack were arrested.
   The windshields of three cars in an outdoor parking lot were
shattered by firebombs, and some furniture inside was smashed,
police said.
   News reports said the group scattered leaflets demanding the
ouster of U.S. Ambassador Donald P. Gregg.
   Radicals claim Gregg devised this year's merger of the governing
party with two smaller parties to serve conservative U.S. business
interests.
   Radical students also fought police outside campuses in Kwangju,
Muan, Punchon, Yongin and two small towns outside Seoul, according
to Yonhap, the national news agency. A total of about 2,500
students took part, it said. There were no reports of arrests or
injuries in those clashes.
   Ten radical students hurled firebombs and smashed windows at the
Wonju city chapter of the governing Democratic Liberal Party and
fled before police arrived, Yonhap said.
   Radical students are a small minority, and many Koreans do not
approve of their tactics. It is difficult to estimate the numbers
of members in outlawed dissident groups, but they number at least
several hundred thousand in this country of 42 million.
   In his television speech flanked by Cabinet ministers, Roh said,
``Right now we are in a difficult time.
   ``We are on a crossroads where the country can either be on a
road toward progress or fall into a road toward chaos.''
   Roh, whose party has been losing popularity, asked all South
Koreans to work to solve the problems of labor unrest, land
speculation, crime and eroding confidence in the economy.
   But the radical National Council of Student Representatives and
the People's Alliance, an umbrella alliance of 17 dissident groups,
announced new nationwide protests aimed at forcing the governing
party to disband.
   In Seoul, Professor Oh Se-chul of Yonsei University released a
statement signed by 1,041 professors at 57 colleges and
universities nationwide demanding the dissolution of the
conservative governing party.
   The statement charged that the party represents an effort ``to
prolong the anti-communist, pro-American ultra-rightist rule of the
present regime.''
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, issued a statement calling the party merger ``a plot by
the Roh regime to prolong power.''
   In his speech, Roh said the recent ``heightening of uneasiness''
had been partly caused by what he called illegal labor strikes at
the state television network and the Hyundai group's shipyard in
Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
   In the strike at the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard, up
to 100 workers on a huge shipyard crane began talks on ending their
protest with company executives today, witnesses said by telephone.
   The workers have been on the 240-foot crane since April 28, when
police raided the shipyard, the world's largest, to oust strikers.
   The raid set off a round of nationwide sympathy strikes, but
most workers returned to their jobs by the end of last week.
   Wages have not been an issue at the shipyard. Workers on the
crane are demanding charges be dropped against union leaders
arrested in earlier protests.
   In his speech, Roh appealed to workers to refrain from demanding
wage increases higher than productivity until the economy has
recovered.
   Inflation has been increasing at an annual rate of more than 10
percent for the first time in many years and the stock market is at
a two-year low. In addition, South Korean products have lost some
competitiveness overseas because of domestic labor unrest, huge
wage increases and the rise of the South Korean currency against
the dollar.

   The driver of a car that careened off a
road and plowed through a Little League baseball game, killing
three children, had blacked out at the wheel, his wife says.
   The driver, James J. Harasek, 59, has refused to answer
investigators' questions on the advice of his attorney, said Don
Doneske, police chief in this Chicago suburb.
   Doneske said police would ask a grand jury today to subpoena
Harasek and look over his medical records.
   Two boys and a girl were killed and nine people injured in
Saturday's accident, including Harasek and six children. All the
youngsters were 7 or 8 years old.
   Two children were listed in critical condition at Loyola
University Medical Center today, and one was in serious condition.
   A woman who identified herself as Harasek's wife, Loretta, said
her husband remembered little of the accident.
   ``He blacked out. He doesn't remember hitting nothing till he
hit the building, that's when he knew he hit something,'' she said
in a telephone interview. ``I'm very deeply hurt and so upset I
can't even begin to say how bad I feel.''
   Asked about a report in the Chicago Sun-Times that her husband
had a heart condition, Mrs. Harasek said he had medical problems
but refused to comment further. The newspaper quoted Harasek's
daughter, Anastasia, as saying, ``We wouldn't allow him to drive,
but he decided he wanted to drive today. His health is usually OK.''
   Harasek's lawyer, Charles G. Levy, refused to comment on his
client's health.
   Harasek was listed in fair condition at MacNeal Hospital in
Berwyn, awaiting surgery on a fractured elbow.
   Killed in the accident were Colin Anderson, 7; Holly Rizzi, 8;
and Ryan Womanck, 8.
   The car traveled nearly 600 feet across the park, crossed a
four-lane road and stopped when it crashed into a medical clinic.
No one in the clinic was injured.
   Officer Robert Gordon said he did not smell alcohol on Harasek's
breath after the accident.
   ``I asked him what happened and he didn't remember,'' said
Gordon.

<HEAD>Reports Say Norwegian Skiers First To Reach North Pole Unaided</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Norwegian skiers reached the North Pole
after a 500-mile trek that was the first without dogs, motorized
vehicles, or supplies delivered en route, news reports said today.
   Erling Kagge, 28, and Boerge Ousland, 27, pulled their
provisions on sleds weighing up to 264 pounds across the Arctic ice
pack, newspapers said. They arrived at the North Pole on Saturday.
   None of at least 12 previous expeditions bound for the North
Pole without dog sleds, snow vehicles or outside supplies covered
more than 105 miles, the Norwegian new agency NTB reported.
   The Norwegians trekked for 58 days to beat British, South Korean
and Soviet teams also racing for the pole, NTB said.
   ``They went unbelievably fast,'' Geir Ramby, a third member of
the Norwegian team, told the Verdens Gang newspaper. He was injured
and flown out 10 days into the trek, which began March 8 on the ice
pack north of Greenland.
   Ramby was in Resolute Bay, Canada, when he received word of his
colleagues' triumph after a U.S. military aircraft picked up their
radio signal Saturday, the newspaper reported. He said a plane
would fly in to pick them up as soon as possible, probably today.
   ``It's a great accomplishment to reach the North Pole without
help. This feat will awaken the attention among those who know how
difficult it is to carry out such an expedition,'' Ramby was quoted
as saying by the newsjpaper.
   Kagge and Ousland crossed crevasses and rough ice, and they
skirted patches of open water. They suffered minor frostbite in
temperatures as low as minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit but were
reported to be in good condition.
   Many expeditions have reached the North Pole since it was
conquered by American Robert Peary in 1909.
   Ramby said his teammates probably will celebrate with a hot
shower when they reach Resolute Bay.
   ``After using and sweating in the same clothes for two months,
they're probably emitting a pretty powerful stink,'' Verdens Gang
quoted him as saying.

   Nearly a week of sit-ins and hunger strikes in
Mongolia ended after the country's largest opposition group agreed
to a compromise and joined a government advisory body, Mongolian
radio said today.
   The Mongolian Democratic Association decided late Sunday to join
other opposition groups in accepting a government offer to set up
an advisory council from which they can submit draft bills and
suggestions to the Communist-dominated legislature.
   Shortly after the agreement was reached, the MDA and its
supporters ended hunger strikes in three cities and sit-ins in the
Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator and several other cities, Mongolian
radio said.
   Mongolian President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, meanwhile, flew home
from China two days earlier than planned, but neither the Chinese
nor the Mongolian Embassy gave any explanation.
   He had arrived Friday for a six-day visit that normalized
relations after nearly three decades of coolness caused by the
Chinese-Soviet split. Mongolia is a Soviet satellite.
   After his departure, the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua,
released the text of a Chinese-Mongolian communique that said the
visit ``opened up a bright prospect for further expanding and
developing bilateral relations.''
   It said Ochirbat invited Chinese President Yang Shangkun and
Premier Li Peng to visit Ulan Bator, and they accepted. No dates
were set.
   The communique also said the two sides ``believed it was useful
to exchange information and experience on socialist construction
and economic reform'' and were ready to hold more meetings on the
subject.
   Mongolia has been following the Soviet example of allowing
vigorous political debate but moving slowly on economic reform,
while China has introduced wide-ranging economic reforms without
relaxing political controls.
   China has shown concern about moves toward democracy in Mongolia
by curbing travel there by its citizens and increasing surveillance
over ethnic Mongols in China. China's Communist Party leader, Jiang
Zemin, advised Ochirbat on Saturday that internal stability is
essential for economic development.
   The wave of sit-ins and hunger strikes in Mongolia began last
week to press for the resignation of the legislature, dominated by
the ruling Communist Party, and establishment of a multiparty
provisional legislature until elections are held this summer.
   A source in Ulan Bator, interviewed by telephone, said the
sit-in by 25 to 30 people in the capital's central square, which
began Wednesday, had ended by midnight Sunday.
   It never attracted crowds of more than several hundred, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In contrast, thousands of people attended rallies in January and
February at which the MDA and other opposition groups pressed their
initial demands for democratic reform. Many of those demands were
met, including that the Communists give up their constitutional
guarantee of power and allow opposition parties.
   Local newspapers reported today that the opposition groups had
agreed to work together to restructure Mongolia's political system,
the source said.
   Details of the advisory council's size, function and makeup were
not disclosed, but it is to work under the legislature's Council of
Ministers and be allowed to draft legislation, the source said.
   The president proposed the council as an alternative to
opposition demands that the 370-member legislature resign and a
multiparty legislature be set up until summer elections. More than
93 percent of the lawmakers are members of the Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   The FBI has made several arrests in a plot by
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to buy Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles, officials say.
   The cartel's plan may have been to use the shoulder-fired
missiles to assassinate Colombian President Virgilio Barco,
according to a federal official in Florida who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   No missiles changed hands, the source said.
   The number of people arrested was unclear, and Larry Curtain,
FBI spokesman in Tampa, refused to comment Sunday. News conferences
were scheduled for this morning.
   But a law enforcement official in Washington who demanded
anonymity said several people were arrested in Miami over the
weekend in an undercover oparation. And another man was arrested in
the Tampa area, the Florida source said.
   The Washington source said the suspects claimed to be working
for reputed cartel leader Pablo Escobar, who is wanted by U.S.
authorities on drug trafficking charges.
   Also Sunday, ABC News reported that the drug cartel had offered
nearly $6 million for more than 100 Stinger missiles and a thousand
machine guns.
   The New York Times today put the number of missiles involved at
24.
   The Times also said that the case is the most recent of several
attempts by drug traffickers to obtain the Stingers, and that none
of the earlier negotiations had gone as far as the plot that was
foiled Saturday. It cited an unidentified senior federal official
as its source.
   ABC also quoted unidentified sources as saying an alleged cartel
member had planned to use the missiles to shoot down planes and
helicopters carrying Barco and members of his Cabinet as part of
the group's campaign of violence against the Colombian government's
war on drugs.
   Violence linked to Colombia's drug lords has claimed the lives
of three presidential candidates in that country in the past year.
   The Stinger is a ground-to-air missile that uses an infrared
homing device to target the heat generated by the engine of an
attacking plane or helicopter. It has proven highly effective
against low-flying aircraft.

<HEAD>Lukens Hasn't Paid $1,500 in State Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, running for
re-election this week under the cloud of a sex-related conviction,
is now facing allegations that he owes more than $1,500 in state
taxes.
   The Columbus Dispatch reported Sunday _ two days before the
Republican primary for Lukens' congressional seat _ that the Ohio
Department of Taxation has certified Lukens as delinquent in paying
$1,514 in state taxes, including a penalty and interest, on his
1988 earnings.
   The paper said the delinquency was certified April 18, and the
Ohio attorney general's office filed a lien April 27 with the
Butler County clerk of courts in Hamilton to collect the money.
   Lukens' top spokesman confirmed Sunday night that the 8th
District congressman hasn't paid the money. But spokesman Bill
Jarrell said Lukens and his staff haven't received any notice about
a lien.
   Jarrell said in a telephone interview that Lukens will pay the
state once he receives a $4,000 tax refund from the federal
government.
   ``He's more than willing to pay the money as soon as possible,''
Jarrell said. ``He has no problems with paying that back. They
(state officials) have never contacted him.''
   Jarrell said he was suspicious about the timing of the report.
   ``The only thing that's a little strange to us is that it came
out two days before the election,'' Jarrell said. ``It brings out a
good case that the other candidates in this race are nervous about
Buz Lukens.''
   Lukens was convicted in Columbus a year ago of contributing to
the unruliness of a minor when a 16-year-old girl said she had
sexual relations with him.
   The congressman has said he is innocent of the misdemeanor, but
lately has been saying he made a mistake in the matter, without
going into detail. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined
$500 and remains free on bond while an appeals court considers his
case.
   Last week, despite calls from his party to resign, Lukens
officially began a re-election campaign he had delayed, pending a
decision on his appeal.
   Also on the Republican ticket are former Rep. Thomas Kindness,
who gave up the congressional seat in 1986 to challenge Sen. John
Glenn; state Rep. John Boehner of West Chester; and Mort Meier, a
bond underwriter from Hamilton.
   The nominee will be whoever gets the most votes, regardless of
whether he receives a majority. There is no provision for a runoff.

Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eyes of the futures industry will be on a
downtown courtroom this week as the first trial begins stemming
from the federal probe of suspected fraud in the nation's largest
commodities markets.
   Jury selection before U.S. District Judge Ann Williams was to
begin Tuesday in the case charging three Swiss franc traders with
trading violations.
   The government alleges that the defendants _ Robert Mosky, Danny
Scheck and David Zatz _ manipulated customer orders and charged the
public for trading errors they should have paid for themselves.
   All three traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They deny
the allegations and have pleaded innocent.
   They are among 48 people, mostly traders, indicted in the
investigation, in which government agents went undercover to ferret
out suspected illegalities in the trading pits at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   FBI agent Randall Jannett, who posed as a corrupt trader during
the probe, is among those expected to testify at this first trial.
   Mark Fuhrman and William Walsh, two Swiss franc traders who
pleaded guilty to reduced charges and are awaiting sentencing, also
are expected to testify against the three defendants.
   Prosecutors allege that the defendants altered trading cards,
traded on inside information and engaged in prearranged trades in
an alleged conspiracy involving Jannett and the two traders who
pleaded guilty.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz are charged with multiple counts of mail
and wire fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. Mosky
also is charged with racketeering conspiracy.

   Sugar growers contributed more than $3.3
million to congressional campaigns between 1983 and 1989 as part of
an effort to keep U.S. sugar prices artificially high, a consumer
group says.
   ``U.S. sugar support policies artificially keep the price of
sugar so high that consumers have spent billions more than they
should have,'' Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said Sunday.
   Officials for the sugar industry acknowledge the campaign
contributions but disputed the contention that consumers are paying
too much for their product.
   ``The program keeps prices stable,'' said Joe Terrell, spokesman
for the American Sugar Alliance. ``Consumers in this country pay on
average about what is paid in developed countries worldwide, or
less in some cases.''
   Critics contend that the system of price supports and quotas for
sugar is among the most blatantly protectionist of any U.S. farm
programs.
   Many foreign suppliers are Third World countries whose economies
rise and fall dramatically depending their access to the U.S.
market.

   A business group is telling political leaders
in Japan and the United States to go to work solving their own
problems at home rather than blame each other for trade friction.
   The Commission on U.S.-Japan Relations for the 21st Century,
including corporate chiefs whose firms have prospered in Japan,
said some of the home-grown problems in the United States are the
federal budget deficit and the American emphasis on quick corporate
profits.
   The two countries should ``acknowledge that there is blame
enough to go around, get on with expanding the horizons of
cooperation, while working through the disputes that frustrate
both,'' said a report issued by the commission last week.
   Besides protectionism and economic decline, a breakdown of
U.S.-Japanese cooperation could have serious political
consequences, said commission Chairman Edson W. Spencer, former
chief executive officer of Honeywell Corp., chairman of the
U.S.-Japan Business Council and board chairman of the Ford

   Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam, says Muslims are fielding candidates for public office
because current officeholders in the Washington area have been
ineffective in dealing with drugs, crime and other social problems.
   Farrakhan's statements Saturday angered some Congressional
leaders and black politicians who say chances of building a
coalition have been hurt.
   ``I don't think anyone can go around and make a blanket
indictment on black leadership,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
``These people who are so apt to question black leadership, where
were they 25 years ago when we marched across the bridge to Selma?''
   Farrakhan made the comments at a local housing project where
Muslims two years ago launched a local antidrug program that rid
the neighborhood of open-air drug markets.
   Abdul Alim Muhammad, Farrakhan's national spokesman and
executive director of the neighborhood antidrug program, said he
will seek the Fifth District U.S. House seat from Prince Georges
County, a Maryland suburb of Washington.
   George X Cure, a legal adviser to a group of Muslims who have
fought drug trafficking through an organization called Dopebusters,
said he will run for the District of Columbia's non-voting seat in
the House.

   ``I meet a lot of people who only want to meet in hotels,''
Holderman said Sunday. ``They're important people who contribute a
lot of money. The hotel rooms are being used as meeting rooms.''
   The expenditures occurred during the last fiscal year, according
to The News of Greenville and The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, which
obtained the records under the South Carolina Freedom of
Information Act.
   The $533,898 spent from the fund, some of it paid with
Holderman's state-issued American Express card, was more than
double the amount spent the previous year. The total includes items
for the school such as new band uniforms and artworks for the
university museum as well as the travel and gift expenses.
   Holderman on Sunday said the expenses on gifts and hotels for
him and other officials were justified since they have so far this
year helped raise more than $25 million in donations.
   More than $90,000 of the expenses charged to the account were
spent on travel, including hotel charges for Holderman ranging as
high as $826 a night, records show.
   State law does not limit spending by agency heads on expenses
such as hotels. But Rep. David Beasley said the spending was a
``grave hypocrisy,'' since university officials had asked the state
for more money to maintain education standards.
   The discretionary account is funded from the proceeds of campus
vending and game machines and concessions. It does not include
state-appropriated funds, Holderman said.
   Among other expenditures were a $1,533 Boston hotel bill from
Aug. 19, 1988, and $2,738 worth of flatware from Tiffany and Co.,
The Greenville News said.
   The discretionary account was used to buy five paintings for the
university's McKissick Museum worth $48,195. Holderman used his
state-issued American Express card to buy two bronze sculptures
worth $6,900, which he said he charged to the museum's account.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration announced today it
will restrict the import of archaeological treasures from the Sipan
region of Peru.
   The action is ``designed to help curb looting in the Sipan
region'' and responds to a request from Peru for help, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   The action means artifacts from Sipan entering the United States
without an export permit from the Peruvian government will be
seized by U.S. Customs agents and returned, the statement said.
   ``The United States believes that the illegal trade in cultural
property does immense damage to our hemispheric cultural
heritage,'' the White House statement said.
   The South American nation asked for assistance in deterring
looting at Sipan, site of what archaeologists call the richest
pre-Columbian tomb found intact in the Western Hemisphere.
   The tomb was discovered at Sipan in 1987. Experts have said it
has yielded important new information about the Moche civilization
that inhabited the river valleys of northern Peru from A.D. 100 to
700. Intricately crafted gold, gilded copper and silver artifacts
reportedly have been discovered at the site.
   ``The United States believes that the illegal trade in cultural
property does immense damage to our hemispheric cultural heritage
and is willing to cooperate with other governments of this region
and elsewhere to prevent illegal trafficking in archaeological
treasures,'' the White House statement said.
   The United States imposed emergency restrictions on some
pre-Columbian artifacts from El Salvador in 1987, and on some
Andean textiles from Bolivia last year. Similar requests from the
governments of Canada and Guatemala are pending.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the World Jewish Congress
said today that economic hardship in Eastern Europe was causing a
rise in anti-Semitism.
   The congress is holding its first meeting ever on German soil,
and President Edgar M. Bronfman acknowledged that some delegates
had declined to attend the three-day conference because of Berlin's
strong links to the Nazi past.
   Bronfman told the 500 delegates at Sunday's opening session that
a united Germany must ``forever teach'' about the Nazi slaughter of
6 million Jews, nearly two-thirds of European Jewry. He called the
Holocaust ``the lowest point ever reached in man's inhumanity to
man.''
   At a news conference today, he expressed concern for the
survivors of Eastern Europe's once vibrant Jewish community and for
the nearly 1.5 million Jews in the Soviet Union.
   These countries are trying to introduce democratic changes at a
time of economic difficulties, and Bronfman said Jews once again
face being singled out for attack.
   Referring to anti-Semitic tendencies in such countries as the
Soviet Union and East Germany, Bronfman cited attempts to revive
``the age-old scapegoat, the Jew'' during economic hard times.
   ``We don't like it,'' Bronfman told the new conference at the
West Berlin Jewish community building. ``The only way to fight it
is to expose it.''
   He said he had received personal assurances from Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that law enforcement officials will
take action against those responsible for anti-Semitic activities.
   In the Soviet Union, ultra-right members of the Russian
nationalist Pamyat organization have threatened Jews. In East
Germany, groups of young skinheads have expressed pro-Nazi
sentiments.
   Early Sunday, right-wing militants fought with foreigners in
street clashes in East Berlin. The official East German news agency
ADN said five people were injured and eight people were arrested.
   Lionel Kopelowitz, head of the European Jewish Congress, said he
had also seen signs of anti-Semitism in Romania.
   During the Romanian election campaign, the right-wing National
Peasants Party has attacked interim Prime Minister Petre Roman
because he is a Jew, and some older party members have links to the
pro-Nazi Iron Guard of World War II.
   The World Jewish Congress was formed in 1936 in Geneva to
mobilize Jews and democratic forces to stop the Nazis from
persecuting Jews.
   The organization's three-day meeting is to end Tuesday with a
ceremony dedicating a Holocaust memorial at the villa in Berlin's
Wannsee district where Nazi leaders met in January 1942 to plot
their so-called Final Solution to kill Jews worldwide. The ceremony
coincides with the anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi
Germany.
   The Congress' executive director, Elan Steinberg, said about 10
percent of the invited delegates from outside Germany declined to
attend the Berlin meeting. There are 80 delegates from outside the
two Germanys at the meeting.
   ``There are people who will not come to Berlin, and they have a
right not to come,'' Bronfman said.
   In his speech Sunday, Bronfman told the delegates that Berlin is
likely to become the capital of a unified Germany and ``inevitably,
the questions of forgiveness and of reconciliation arise.''
   ``Reconciliation is possible if we speak the truth. And, the
truth is that only the 6 million Jews who were murdered can
forgive, Bronfman told the crowd, which included West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   He said a new generation of Germans should not be blamed for the
crimes of their fathers, but ``we do demand, nonetheless, an
admission of collective responsibility.''
   In an address to the delegates, Kohl said: ``Never may it be
forgotten that the genocide of the European Jews was prepared and
directed by the national socialists (Nazis) under the violent
leadership from Berlin.''
   He said it remained the duty of ``all democratic powers, also
those in a united Germany, to fight without compromise against
those who secretly or openly spread prejudice.''

<HEAD>Fort Worth Rejects Sales Tax Increase for Crime-Fighting Taxing
District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters overwhelmingly rejected a
proposed half-cent increase in the sales tax to pay for a new
crime-fighting agency touted as the first of its kind in the nation.
   The proposed Tarrant County Crime Control and Prevention
District lost Saturday by a vote of 22,784 against to 9,179 for. It
won support from only 29 percent of the voters taking part in the
election.
   Opponents had handed cards to voters on their way to the polls
that warned, ``Your taxes are about to go up!''
   The crime-fighting tax would have raised an estimated $45
million a year for police, courts, education, crime prevention,
punishment and rehabilitation programs.
   Advocates said the separate taxing district for crime-fighting
would have helped dissolve boundaries between governmental agencies
and link private organizations involved in the battle against
crime. They said it would have been the first of its kind in the
nation.
   In Kansas City, Mo., voters last year approved a special sales
tax, but it was for a slightly more narrow purpose, aimed at drugs
rather than crime in general. The new tax there went into effect
last month.
   The Fort Worth plan drew opposition from two separate fronts _
conservatives opposed to a tax increase, and minority groups who
said the plan wouldn't be an improvement.
   Some of the revenue would have paid for four new criminal courts
in Fort Worth, a state-of-the-art computerized fingerprint
identification system to be shared by all police agencies in the
county; a ``boot camp'' for young first-time criminal offenders;
and several new community jails.
   Also proposed were drug education and treatment programs and
expanded citizen crime-prevention programs.
   Half the money from the sales tax would have gone to county
programs, a quarter would have been divided among the 37
municipalities in the county, and a quarter would have been
reserved for multicity projects.

<TEXT>
   In three days of lightning raids on
jungle drug labs and airstrips, soldiers seized more than 13 tons
of cocaine in Colombia's biggest drug seizure ever, authorities
said.
   They said that in the series of raids, which ended over the
weekend, troops found silos stuffed with cocaine awaiting shipment
to the United States. One silo alone was said to contain 20,000
pounds of the drug.
   The raids in the sparsely populated southeastern state of Meta
brought to 110,000 pounds the amount of cocaine seized by security
forces in the last 16 months, authorities said.
   They began Thursday, ended Saturday and netted 26,400 pounds of
the drug, they said. The previous Colombian record was 22,000
pounds, or 11 tons, found in remote southern Colombia six years ago.
   The world's biggest drug seizure was 21.4 tons, discovered in a
raid on a warehouse in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles in
September 1989.
   A Colombian army general said the network of laboratories and
clandestine runways found by the soldiers in Meta were believed to
belong to the powerful Medellin cartel.
   Gen. Humberto Correa told the radio network RCN that soldiers,
backed up by fighter bombers and helicopter gunships, found small
silos filled with cocaine ready for transport.
   The army found 26 runways where coca paste was flown in from
Bolivia and Peru and cocaine was flown out to the United States,
Correa said in the interview Saturday night. Five airplanes were
seized.
   Two people were killed in fighting and there were 15 arrests, he
said.
   On Sunday, a truck bomb exploded outside Cali, a cocaine
trafficking center, and another was deactivated in Medellin,
national police said. Rival drug cartels are based in the two
cities. Authorities said they did not know of the motive in the
planting of the bombs.
   Drug traffickers have used terrorist attacks to try to end a
Colombian government crackdown, but car bombs also have been used
in a two-year war between the cocaine cartels.
   The Cali truck bomb, made of an estimated 220 pounds of
dynamite, demolished a tourist complex that included a restaurant,
bar, dance hall and swimming pool, the police said.
   But the complex was empty at the time of the predawn explosion,
and no one was hurt, police Col. Rodrigo Millan said in a broadcast
interview with the RCN radio chain.
   In Medellin, a 550-pound dynamite bomb was found in an abandoned
truck, the army's headquarters in Medellin said in a communique.
   The Medellin and Cali cartels, which U.S. officials say supply
the majority of cocaine to the United States, have been fighting
for control of the cocaine market in the New York City area.
   In another development, French police on the Caribbean island of
Saint Martin seized 770 pounds of cocaine Sunday aboard a
twin-engine plane belonging to Colombian drug traffickers, Interior
Minister Pierre Joxe announced.
   Six people were arrested at the small airport in the French part
of Saint Martin, the other section of which is administered by the
Netherlands.
   Several dozen police officers and narcotics agents took part in
the operation, French officials said. Joxe said the plane belonged
to Cali traffickers.

<HEAD>Syria Won't Attend Emergency Arab Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syria announced today it will not attend
an emergency Arab summit in Baghdad, capital of its arch-rival
Iraq, Arab officials said.
   The Syrians instead proposed that foreign ministers of the
22-member Arab League meet in Tunis to recommend an alternative
venue. The Syrians have said they weren't consulted before the
meeting place was selected.
   It was not immediately clear whether the summit would go ahead.
   The Syrian decision stymied Arab efforts led by Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Jordan to mediate a reconciliation between Syrian
President Hafez Assad and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and end an
11-year-old rift.
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa conveyed Syria's decision
today to Arab League Secretary-General Chadlie Klibi, who arrived
in Damascus late Sunday, Arab officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency reported the meeting
between Sharaa and Klibi.
   Sharaa suggested ``the Arab League Council convene to conduct
consultations on a convenient venue and date for the summit and to
agree on the topics to be discussed at the forum,'' the news agency
said.
   The Arab League Council comprises the foreign ministers of the
21 member states plus the Palestine Liberation Organiztaion's
political department chief, regarded as a foreign minister in the
Arab world.
   Earlier, Saudi Arabia, Syria's main bankroller, threw its weight
behind an emergency Arab summit in Baghdad. Saudi Arabia was
understood to have said previously that it would not attend a
summit in Baghdad unless Syria did.
   Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz flew from
Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, today after lengthy talks with the Iraqi
president. He met Assad in Damascus Saturday.
   Abdullah met with King Hussein in Amman. The monarch, who has
also sought to mediate an end to the 11-year-old break between
Syria and Iraq, is a close ally of Saddam.
   A senior Jordanian official said on condition of anonymity: ``We
believe an Arab summit will be convened for sure this month'' in
Baghdad.
   ``All the indications are that a summit will take place,
especially after Saudi Arabia announced it will attend,'' he said.
   Assad's dispute with Iraq and his 7-year-old feud with PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat are the main obstacles to Arab efforts
toward a new unity.
   Arafat has been at odds with Syria since 1983 when Syrian-backed
radical Palestinian factions mutinied against him and drove his
guerrillas out of their last Lebanese stronghold.
   Assad has not recognized the Palestinian state, declared in
1988, and still holds 2,000 of Arafat's loyalists in his prisons.
   Syria and Iraq have been at odds since 1979. The countries are
ruled by different wings of the Arab Baath Socialist Party and are
rivals for political leadership of the modern Arab world.
   Arafat in April called for the summit to be held in Baghdad to
discuss mass Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel, Middle East peace
moves and the crisis in Lebanon.
   The Iraqis have said they also want to discuss perceived threats
from Israel and the West against them. Syrian officials have
indicated they do not take Iraq's concern seriously.
   In Iran, the English-language Tehran Times called the summit ``a
political venture'' by Saddam to gain Arab backing in face of
Western criticism of his government.

   Six climbers from the United States, China and
Soviet Union reached the top of Mount Everest today in an
expedition intended to foster good will among their nations and
pick trash off the world's highest peak.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said they reached the summit of
the 29,028-foot-high peak this afternoon.
   The climbers had said they would plant the flags of the three
nations atop the peak to symbolize achievement possible through
cooperation.
   The six are part of a 46-member expedition that began climbing
Everest in March and originally had hoped to put climbers at the
top on April 22, Earth Day.
   The climbers neared the peak in late April but were forced by
high winds to retreat to base camp. They set out a second time on
April 30.
   On their way back down the mountain, the climbers are to pick up
an estimated 2 tons of cans, tents, oxygen bottles and other debris
left by previous expeditions.
   Xinhua said the six who reached the top included Americans
Stephen Gall, who operates a mountain guide service in Aspen,
Colo., and Robert Link, whose hometown wasn't given.
   With them were Soviets Sergey Arsentjev and Grigory Lunjakov and
Tibetan climbers Jiabu and Daqimi, on the Chinese team. Both
Tibetans use only one name.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said
today the Soviet Union has not yet accepted the Western allies'
insistence that a reunited Germany be a member of NATO.
   Woerner, after meeting with President Bush, said the upcoming
NATO summit in London will ``most likely'' be held in the first
half of July, but the dates are not yet set.
   The annual economic summit of the seven major industrialized
democracies _ all NATO members except Japan _ is July 9-11 in
Houston.
   Seeking to calm Soviet concerns about Germany, Woerner said,
``We do not want to change the balance of power to their
disadvantage.''
   He said the 16-nation NATO compact was taking on a more
political role to fit the changing landscape of Europe.
   ``We are clearly on the move from confrontation to
cooperation,'' Woerner told reporters outside the White House. ``We
are looking at this alliance ... as an element of cooperation in a
new security structure'' for Europe.
   ``NATO will clearly be one of the essential pillars, if not the
essential pillar, in such a structure,'' he said.
   He said they are moving toward ``a landscape of disarmament and
beyond disarmament, a landscape of minimal deterrence, a landscape
in which really all (nations) only maintain as much forces as
necessary for self-defense and stability.''
   But asked if the Soviet Union has reconciled itself to Germany's
being a NATO member, he replied, ``As far as I know, not yet.''
   Woerner stopped at the White House en route to Canada, where he
will attend a meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group on Wednesday
and Thursday near Calgary.
   Bush announced last Thursday that he was scrapping plans to
modernize short-range Lance nuclear missiles in Germany and upgrade
nuclear artillery shells in view of the shifts toward democracy in
the East Bloc.
   But in a speech at Oklahoma State University on Friday, Bush
said NATO must remain ``the foundation for America's peaceful
engagement in Europe.'' He promised to keep nuclear weapons in
Europe to help maintain peace.
   Woerner praised Bush's speech, saying, ``His ideas have gotten
strong support, broad support, inside our alliance.''
   The Soviets have suggested dual German membership in both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   Woerner said, ``To be a member of both pacts is just neutrality
without a word.''

<TEXT>
   Monopoly players no longer need to
buy the board game to get their vicarious thrills at cornering the
market on Boardwalk, Park Place and other properties in this casino
city.
   Would-be wheeler-dealers can be the boot, the hat, the horse,
the race car, the thimble or the wheelbarrow when they participate
in a new mail-order Monopoly game in which a computer rolls the
dice.
   Patience is a virtue in this version, which is the idea of a
Gaithersburg, Md., company called Mail Games. Each round of moves
takes about two weeks.
   Why would anyone want to play in a game that extends the
seemingly endless hours of Monopoly play into weeks, months and
years?
   Mail Games founder Glenn Leyba said the answer can be found in
the fascination Monopoly has held for people since Parker Brothers
first immortalized the streets of Atlantic City 55 years ago, from
$60 Mediterranean Avenue to the highly coveted $400 Boardwalk.
   ``With this game,'' Leyba added, ``there's nobody standing over
you telling you to buy or sell a property.''
   He said he got the idea after visiting a friend in New York who
was managing a ``Dungeons and Dragons'' mail-order game.
   In the game's first year, Leyba has advertised in magazines
devoted to mail-order games to attract 24 players _ six games of
four people apiece. Players have the option of spending $25.95 in
real money for a six-month subscription or $49.95 for a 12-month
subscription.
   Atlantic City tourism officials are pleased by the prospect of a
new twist on the game that helped bring fame to their city. But an
attorney for Parker Brothers, which owns Monopoly, gave a more wary
appraisal.
   ``I haven't heard about this,'' said New York attorney Steve
Weinberg. ``I'd like to take a look at it.''
   In recent years, Parker Brothers has gone to court for alleged
infringements spawned by hometown Monopoly games based on local
streets and a Worldopoly game.
   Leyba said he checked out his product with trademark and
copyright attorneys before marketing the game. He said he has
avoided using the style and design of the game, although the game
literature does suggest use of a Monopoly board to follow along.

   Craig and Bonnie Dale didn't realize what
they were getting into when they decorated the carriage house
behind their new home with a sculpture of the Greek deity Pan, god
of pastures, flocks and shepherds.
   The Dales thought the bearded, horned creature would make a nice
rooftop ornament for the carriage house, which they plan to use as
an art studio.
   But rumors soon swept the town that the Dales were devil
worshipers. Pan is usually represented with the head, body and arms
of a human but the beard, horns, tail and legs of a goat.
   It didn't help that the couple's Victorian home had formerly
served as a funeral parlor.
   In April, the trouble culminated when a group of teen-agers
gathered outside the home, yelling and pointing at Pan.
   ``It's just bizarre,'' Craig Dale told The Journal of New Ulm.
``People are taking it way too seriously. It's just a wood carving
on top of an art studio.''
   The Dales say townspeople who have learned about their plight
are spreading the word that there's no reason to panic.
   ``This thing about being a satanist is very offensive,'' said
Mrs. Dale.
   Dale said he has no hard feelings about their chilly initial
welcome to New Ulm, a largely German town in southern Minnesota. He
said he realizes it's easy for rumors to spread.
   ``People don't understand, and they react with fear and
paranoia,'' he said.

   Police arrested an eye doctor and 11
morgue attendants for allegedly stealing eyes from bodies in the
city morgue for use in cornea transplant operations, authorities
said Monday.
   The scandal broke Friday when a pathologist performing an
autopsy on the body of a 20-year-old male at the Caracas morgue
noticed that the eyes had been removed, police said.
   She notified other doctors, who began looking though the
refrigerated sections where bodies are kept. Five other corpses,
all of young people, were also eyeless, police said.
   On Saturday night, police arrested Juan Gerardo Schultz, a
37-year-old ophthalmologist, at his eye clinic in Maracay, about 60
miles west of Caracas, said police commissioner Alexis Bolivar.
   Police also were questioning other medical personnel at the eye
clinic, he said.
   Also arrested over the weekend were 11 morgue attendants,
including one man who had previously worked for the Eye Bank, a
non-profit organization that helps find donor organs for cornea
transplant patients.
   Police sources said Schultz allegedly paid the morgue attendants
up to $23 per eye, and charged from $1,500 to $2,000 for a cornea
transplant operation.
   Clear corneas from dead people are used in transplant operations
to replace corneas that are clouded by cataracts.

   A group of Japanese scientists has developed a
device that determines if a person is too tired to drive, the
University of Tokyo announced Monday.
   Professor Masao Karube of the university's Research Center for
Advanced Science and Technology said the device is worn like a
wristwatch and equipped with an enzyme sensor that detects lactic
acid contained in perspiration. The density of the lactic acid
indicates the degree of fatigue, he explained.
   The information monitored by the device is transmitted by radio
waves to an analyzer so that the wearer can move freely but easily
read the information on the analyzer's panel, Karube said.

doctors said. He was 55.
   Doctors said Lawrence, who had been in Japan with the ballet
since mid-April, fell in a Tokyo hotel last Thursday and was sent
to the Metropolitan Hiroo Hospital by ambulance.
   Lawrence was born in Hamilton, New Zealand. He had been musical
director of the Stuttgart Ballet since 1987. Before that, Lawrence

   A record flood crest on the rain-swollen Trinity
River surged southward toward the Gulf of Mexico today, threatening
to swamp rural areas along the way after devastating a Dallas
neighborhood.
   Emergency workers helped sandbag rising streams in Arkansas. A
reservoir on the Texas-Oklahoma line that flooded shoreline homes
reached a record height and began falling today, but high wind
threatened to cause more shoreline damage by kicking up waves.
   The death toll from the flooding caused by last week's
thunderstorms stood at six today, all in Texas. Twelve Texas deaths
have been blamed on weather in the past several weeks.
   The Red Cross in Texas counted 723 dwellings destroyed and more
than 2,000 damaged in the last two weeks by the state's most
serious flooding since 1908.
   Water from the Trinity stood several feet deep in the Rochester
Park area outside Dallas, and some houses were submerged. Flood
stage is 30 feet and the Trinity stood at 43.8 feet in Dallas early
today. More than 400 residents were evacuated last week.
   Alester Crumbley said this is the third time in a year his home
has been flooded. He moved back in two weeks ago after spending
$11,000 and several months rebuilding from two floods last year.
   ``I don't think I'll be able to do it again, I'm so deep in
debt,'' he said.
   North Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first four
months of 1990, the most since 1922. As much as 7 inches of rain
fell within 24 hours in some areas in past days.
   Flooding continued in rural counties along the Trinity south of
Dallas, as high water washed out levees. At Trinidad, 60 miles
southeast of Dallas, the river was 47.5 feet deep Sunday, far above
the 28-foot flood stage.
   In Dallas, the Red Cross has opened shelters for evacuees since
heavy rain, flooding and tornadoes swept across North Texas a week
ago. Through the weekend, about 1,500 people had been sheltered and
more than 12,000 meals served, the Red Cross said.
   In Arkansas, the worst of the flooding was likely in the Little
Rock area on Tuesday, when the Arkansas River is expected to crest,
said Gary Talley of the state Office of Emergency Services.
   North Little Rock scaled back emergency personnel assigned to
flood-control tasks to give workers a rest before Tuesday.
   ``We feel like we're in pretty good shape, that we've done all
we can in expectation of the river rising another foot,'' said
North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays. ``The sandbags are
doing what they're supposed to do. We feel like we've won that
battle.''
   The Arkansas was expected to rise to 27.5 feet today and reach
28 feet by Tuesday morning, 5 feet above flood stage.
   Downstream at Pine Bluff, the river reached 45 feet, its highest
level in 33 years, and forced more than 400 people from their
homes. Officials said a crest of 48 feet is expected Wednesday,
topping the 44.7-foot crest of 1973.
   On the Oklahoma-Texas line, Lake Texoma was expected to crest
today at about 644.76 feet, or almost 5 feet above the overflow
spillways. The lake topped the old record of 643 feet Saturday and
continued rising even though the Army Corps of Engineers was
releasing 145,000 cubic feet of water per second.
   ``The best estimate the (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) can give
you is it'll go down 3 inches per day,'' said Marshall County Civil
Defense Director John Martin.
   He said wind expected to blow at 15 to 25 mph today would kick
up waves that could erode foundations of buildings that are already
submerged, and push water up into homes that have been dry so far.
   A preliminary count Sunday found 83 homes in Marshall County
partially submerged by water from Texoma.
   Despite warnings of submerged power lines, floating propane
tanks, trees, docks and other obstacles, many sightseers toured the
lake by boat.
   In Dallas, U.S. Rep. John Bryant toured Rochester Park by boat
and came across one of the last flood victims awaiting rescue _ a
large dog atop a filing cabinet in several feet of water.
   Bryant's district is among the 16 counties declared disaster
areas by President Bush.
   Officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived on
Sunday to process claims for relief. About 500 requests already
have been received.

   A woman waiting for a bus was killed
Monday when police opened fire to stop a truck from barreling into
a group of demonstrators, police said. The gunfire injured a man,
who also was at the bus stop.
   Neither victim was involved in the demonstration by workers
protesting the possible closing of their company.
   The 23-year-old woman was hit in the throat and died in a
hospital. The man was slightly injured in the arm by the same
bullet, said a police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The shooting occurred as about 500 workers of the PRB gunpowder
factory held a sit-in at a major intersection in central Brussels.
A truck broke through a police cordon and headed toward the
protesters, and a police officer tried to shoot out the truck's
tires, officials said.
   The bullet missed its target and went astray, hitting the man
and woman who were waiting for a bus near the intersection. The
driver and passenger of the truck were detained.
   The workers were protesting in front of two banks involved with
the company, which filed for bankruptcy Friday. A court will make a
decision on the claim later this week.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 163 fundamentalist
Hindus on Monday and stopped them from laying the foundation of a
shrine at a place of worship claimed both by the Hindus and Moslems.
   The disputed site, in Ayodhya about 240 miles east of New Delhi,
was the focus of bloody Hindu-Moslem clashes last year.
   Indian news reports said two groups of Hindu devotees were
stopped from going to Ayodhya to lay a foundation for a Hindu
temple. The arrests Monday brought to 313 the number of
fundamentalists detained since Saturday in the area.
   Bricks for the temple's foundation were also seized, the reports
said. Police also sealed off roads leading to the disputed site.
   Ayodhya was at the center of a controversy between Hindus and
Moslems last year and led to the deaths of about 300 people in
clashes in three states.
   Last August, Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a
new temple to their god, Ram, on the site of a 17th century mosque
in Ayodhya. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which backs the temple
program, maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu
temple marking the spot where the group says Ram was born 900,000
years ago.
   Most of the deaths occurred in late October in Bihar state, next
to Ayodhya's Uttar Pradesh state, as bricks for the temple were
borne by Hindu processions to the dusty town on the Saryu River.
   The controversy, which occurred shortly before national
elections, is thought to have hurt former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi. Gandhi's Congress Party lost the election and was replaced
by Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   The problems in Ayodhya also contributed to worsening ties with
Moslem Pakistan. During the troubles last year, Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto made several statements in support of
India's Moslems.
   Relations between the two countries have deteriorated further
because of a bloody separatist campaign in India's state of
Jammu-Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the campaign
with arms and training. Pakistan denies the charge and says India
is crushing a movement for self-determination.
   Since Jan. 20 when India launched a crackdown in Kashmir, at
least 349 people have died in the state.
   Twelve percent of India's 880 million people are Moslems and 82
percent are Hindus.

<HEAD>Jackal: Original Plan Was to Kidnap, Execute De Gaulle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hired assassin who almost succeeded in
killing French President Charles de Gaulle in 1962 says disgruntled
French officers planned to kidnap, try and then execute the general.
   In an interview published Sunday in the daily El Pais, Georges
Henri Watin, better known as ``The Jackal,'' said the plan went
awry before he shot at de Gaulle in his presidential vehicle in the
French village of Petit Clamart.
   The incident was dramatized in a 1971 novel by Frederick
Forsythe called ``The Day of the Jackal.'' It was later made into a
film.
   Watin, now a Paraguayan citizen who claims to live
hand-to-mouth, said the novelistic version of the Aug. 22, 1962,
plot bears no relation to what really happened.
   ``Reality is too dramatic. I know my own story, and one thing I
have to make clear is that there was never a plan simply to kill
`the old man' in Petit Clamart. The plan was to kidnap him, bring
him to justice before a military court-martial, and only then,
execute him,'' Watin said.
   De Gualle was to be tried for his support of Algeria's
independence from France.
   Watin said the plan was to kidnap de Gaulle at sunset, but the
officers who did the figuring used an almanac from the previous
year and got the time wrong. The presidential cortege arrived
earlier than expected.
   ``Suddenly I realized that the whole plan should be scrapped
immediately,'' Watin said. ``But by then it was too late.''
   Watin said he and the two other hired guns shot at the rear
window of de Gaulle's car and at the two rear tires.
   ``For a moment I looked directly at his (de Gaulle's) eyes. Our
car was right alongside his, but we had calculated shooting at a
car that was practically immobile,'' Watin said. ``Later I learned
I had missed him by just two centimeters.''
   De Gaulle was harshly criticized in the early 1960s for favoring
the independence of Algeria. In April 1961, four French generals
based in Algiers and belonging to the Secret Army Organization
staged an abortive coup against de Gaulle's government.
   Shortly after the Petit Clamart attack, de Gaulle announced
Algeria deserved to become independent. On July 3, 1962, he
proclaimed Algeria a sovereign nation.
   Watin said after the Petit Clamart attack, the Secret Army
Organization sent him to Switzerland, where he was arrested six
months later.
   He said the French government immediately sent a special police
unit to arrest him but Swiss authorities decided he was not a
political detainee so he could not be turned over.
   ``Two years later the Swiss expelled me, so I went first to
Seville and then to South America. I am now a Paraguayan citizen,''
Watin said.

<TEXT>
   Mohawks on both sides
of a feud over gambling agreed to put aside their differences for
the funeral today of an Indian slain in a dispute in which he had
no part.
   Harold Edwards Jr., a 32-year-old ironworker, died Tuesday after
being shot near an anti-gambling blockade on the Canadian side of
this 28,000-acre reservation, where Mohawks are torn over whether
to allow casinos.
   Edwards was described as neutral on the gambling issue.
   Authorities said only Mohawks would be allowed at his funeral at
St. Regis Catholic Church.
   Gambling advocates and opponents paid their respects to Edwards'
family Sunday, said Barbara Barnes, spokeswoman for an
anti-gambling faction.
   ``He was a friend of everyone. He always had a smile. He was a
total victim,'' said Francis Boots, spokesman for the pro-gambling
Warrior Society, a self-appointed reservation security force armed
with automatic weapons.
   Also slain Tuesday was 22-year-old Matthew Pyke, an opponent of
gambling. Pyke was buried Friday. No arrests have been made.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo repeated today that his administration is
prepared to help negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute.
   At a news conference at the state Capitol, Cuomo said state
police would remain on the reservation ``as long as it seems to me
to be essential.''
   ``None of the elected chiefs have asked us to remove them,''
said Henrik Dullea, Cuomo's director of state operations and the
man who will head the state's negotiating team. Some Indians have
demanded that the state police be pulled out before negotiations
begin.
   Boots said he doesn't believe Edwards' slaying and the union of
pro- and anti-gambling forces at his funeral would bring an end to
beatings, gunfire and arson that have torn apart the 9,000-member
reservation for nine months.
   The reservation's six casinos bring busloads of gamblers from
the Northeast, offering slot machines, bingo, roulette, craps and
other games.
   Supporters of gambling say the casinos produce jobs and revenue;
opponents say gambling has brought drugs, guns and prostitution and
is destroying traditional ways.
   The Canadian military has posted 260 soldiers and 100 vehicles
at the border, and about 500 state troopers patrolled in and around
the reservation to keep the peace, despite some Mohawks' insistence
that the reservation is sovereign territory, authorities said. The
reservation was quiet Sunday.
   About 200 of the 1,000 Mohawks who fled their homes after the
slayings remained sheltered Sunday at a military dormitory in
Cornwall, Ontario.
   ``We will let them stay as long as they want to,'' said Jim
Ransom, a sub-chief on the Mohawk Tribal Council, one of the
reservation's three governing bodies. ``The reservation is still
not completely safe.''

   A cantankerous Canada goose has taken on the
Internal Revenue Service with a vengeance some taxpayers may only
dream about.
   For two months, the goose has settled in on a parking island at
the Ogden IRS Center, chasing employees and otherwise taxing the
taxers.
   ``She gets a little bent out of shape,'' said Dennis Howland,
assistant public affairs officer. ``She tries to keep people from
getting into their cars.''
   Howland said one woman was trapped inside her car for 20 minutes
while the goose sat outside the vehicle. She was finally rescued
when she put in her windshield a cardboard sun visor saying ``Send
Emergency Help.''
   A woman carrying pizza to her car was chased by the goose. She
dropped the food, but made it to the car.
   The next day, she found the goose on her car's hood.
   ``That goose literally destroyed her wax job,'' Howland said.
   A male employee was outwitted by the bird when the goose reached
his 4-wheel-drive truck before he did. When the man attempted to
run around to the passenger side, the goose beat him by running
beneath the vehicle.
   Thinking maternal instincts might be to blame, IRS officials
confiscated the goose's nest of four eggs and moved it to the
nearby Ogden Nature Center. But mom didn't follow.
   Despite the cranky nature of the loose goose, employees like
having her around, and center officials have no plans to move her,
Howland said.
   ``We figure she just doesn't want to be bothered during these
taxing times,'' he said.

   Drought has been turning many lawns
brown, but landscapers have a solution: green paint.
   Walter Barrows said he has received more than 30 calls a week
since he began advertising his grass-painting service.
   Barrows charges $45 to paint the average-size lawn with a
vegetable dye. It will stay green for just over a month.
   ``This kind of thing is done all over the country with football
fields, lawn tennis courts and golf greens,'' Barrows said.
   ``After working hard all day, some people don't want to come
home to a brown lawn,'' said Martin Senn, a manager at La Sumida
Nursery, which also sells lawn paint.
   Painting is just one of several tactics residents are using to
keep their yards green since the city, faced with an almost 50
percent water shortage for the year, banned lawn watering.
   Some have replaced lawns with green concrete, green gravel,
stone or bark, hoping that when the dry spell is over they can
restore their yards, said Bob McNall, owner of McNall Building
Material.
   Others recycle household water and some buy water from private
wells that is brought in by tanker trucks.

   Really creative excuses for missed
assignments only come along every couple of years, says a Duke
University professor who won a contest for submitting the best
excuse heard for turning in a late paper.
   The contest was sponsored by The Chronicle, the student
newspaper. The winning entries were published April 26.
   David Canon, an assistant political science professor, won with
his account of his protracted struggle with a student over a late
paper.
   The student first claimed computer disk problems, then said
she'd locked herself out of her room. Later she claimed to have
slipped the paper under Canon's office door _ or was it his mailbox?
   ``Sure,'' Cannon wrote, ``just like we were told in 1967, `Our
boys will be home by Christmas.''' He got the paper two months late.
   Canon told The Charlotte Observer: ``This semester I had a woman
who had almost every personal life crisis you could think of, all
in three months. She broke up with her boyfriend of six years, her
roommate had an abortion, her mother got sick. ...
   ``I think if I write that one up I'll have another winner next
year.''
   One of the excuses submitted was by a professor, not a student.
Roger Kaplan, a literature instructor, said his dog really did eat
a library book he was reading in preparation for a class.

   One leftist guerrilla was killed and
another captured by Israeli troops and their militia allies today
during a clash inside Israel's self-designated security zone in
southern Lebanon, sources said.
   The four-hour firefight broke out early this morning near the
villages of al-Teebeh and Beit Yahoun in the Israeli-occupied
border strip, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   The Syrian Social Nationalist Party claimed responsibility for
the attack. The party is a leftist Lebanese group that advocates
merging Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, pre-1948 Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait
and Cyprus into a greater Syria.
   Several other guerrillas reportedly fled, and the security
sources said Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the South Lebanon
Army began a search.
   Israel established the six- to 10-mile-deep border zone when it
withdrew most of its army from southern Lebanon in mid-1985, three
years after it invaded.
   The strip, which extends from the Mediterranean coast in the
west to the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east, is a buffer to curb
guerrilla attacks into northern Israel.
   Palestinian and Lebanese guerrilla groups repeatedly attack the
occupied zone.

   The nation's railway minister said
agents of the Indian or Afghan governments may have been
responsible for a train bombing that killed 13 people and injured
40.
   The 4-pound bomb exploded Sunday afternoon in the restroom of a
first-class passenger car, according to Mohammad Iqram Bed,
stationmaster at the Badami Bagh station just outside Lahore in
eastern Pakistan. The bomb went off while the train was stopped to
allow the track ahead to clear.
   ``I do not rule out the possibility of either an Indian or
Afghan hand behind it,'' Railways Minister Zaffar Leghari told
reporters at the site of the bombing late Sunday.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
   Twelve people died at the scene Sunday, and one person died at a
Lahore hospital today, authorities said.
   A police superintendent said the device was a ``foreign-made
time bomb.'' The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
declined to identify the country where the bomb was made.
   The police official said the bomb would have exploded at
Lahore's congested downtown train station had it not been for a
10-minute delay en route.
   The 10-car Taz Gam Express, Pakistan's fastest train, was
traveling to the southern port city of Karachi from Rawalpindi in
the northeast.
   Pakistan's relations with neighboring India on the east, less
than 10 miles from the bombing, have been strained since January by
a Moslem secessionist uprising in Indian-held Kashmir. The Indians
accuse the Pakistanis of fomenting the unrest, which Pakistan
denies.
   Some Pakistani newspapers have blamed a series of bombings in
Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Indian secret service agents.
At least four bombs exploded in the cities last month, killing and
wounding scores of people.
   Mainly Hindu India and Pakistan, a Moslem-dominated country,
have fought three wars since they became independent in 1947.
   On Pakistan's western border, Afghan rebels are fighting a
12-year-old war to topple Afghanistan's communist government. The
U.S.-backed rebels have headquarters in Pakistan.
   Most of the hundreds of bombings in Pakistan over the past few
years have occurred in the Northwest Frontier Province. They have
been routinely blamed on agents of Afghanistan's government.

   Prince wowed the hometown crowd with a
rendition of ``The Question of U'' from his upcoming film and
soundtrack album, ``Grafitti Bridge.''
   Sunday night's 17,000-ticket sellout at the St. Paul Civic
Center was announced only Thursday night and billed as Prince's
only large U.S. concert before beginning his Nude Tour of Europe on
June 2 in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
   Most of the numbers Prince played Sunday were stripped-down rock
versions of a cross-section of his older material with his band.
   ``I've been to a lot of concerts in this place, but they ain't
quite like this one,'' said Prince, who lives in suburban
Chanhassen. ``Yeah, yeah, yeah, you all belong to me. And you know
what? I belong to you.''
   The singer concluded the erotic ballad ``Scandalous'' by lying
in a crucifixion pose on a stainless steel heart that was
hydraulically raised and lowered.

   ``I've said about all there is to say in books,'' the
79-year-old author said in a recent interview with the Seattle
Times. ``God bless the man who knows when he's said enough and
isn't tempted to say more.''
   The aviator, sailor and world traveler wrote 22 best sellers,
including ```The High and the Mighty,'' ``Fate Is the Hunter,''
``Twilight for the Gods,'' and ``The Antagonists.'' His latest,
``The Black Watch,'' is about the U-2 spy plane he once piloted.
   Gann's artwork is being snapped up at a local gallery.
   ``These aren't just Sunday-afternoon paintings,'' Gann said of
his works, which use bold strokes and vivid colors. ``I'd like to
be an inspiration to older people, to let them know that a second
career is possible at any age.''
   Gann, in failing health from liver, kidney and heart problems,
said of his second career: ``If it all ends tomorrow, I'm pretty
happy with what I've accomplished in a short time.''
   Gann lives with his wife, Dodie, on an 800-acre ranch on San

   Opening statements in the second molestation
trial of Ray Buckey began today but were interrupted when an
alternate juror reported she was distraught over a weekend boat
fire that imperiled her family.
   The woman juror, who agreed to go forward with the trial of the
McMartin Pre-School case, began coughing violently moments after
the prosecutor began his address to the jury and had to be led out
of the courtroom.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg called a recess to give
the juror time to compose herself and see if she would able to
proceed.
   The woman told Weisberg before the session began that her entire
family was aboard the boat, which was engulfed in flames before
they were rescued by the shore patrol. She said she and others
suffered smoke inhalation.
   She said she took a tranquilizer before coming to court, but ``I
feel very nervous and upset.''
   The interruption came as Deputy District Attorney Joseph
Martinez was beginning to recount for jurors the evidence which he
said would prove that three little girls were molested by Buckey at
the family owned preschool in Manhattan Beach.
   He told how one child began to have nightmares and showed other
signs of molestation during the two years she attended the McMartin
school.
   As Martinez spoke, Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, sat
in the audience taking notes. The defendant's father, Charles
Buckey, also attended, but the spectator section was not as crowded
as it was during the culmination of another trial in which Buckey's
mother was acquitted of all charges and Ray Buckey was acquitted of
the majority of allegations against him.
   The district attorney's office decided to retry the 31-year-old
Buckey on eight counts involving the three children, a greatly
diminished number from the hundreds which were once said to have
been molested at the school.
   The prosecution has said the new trial could last six months.
The first trial lasted nearly three years and cost $13 million,
making it the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S.
history.
   The first trial ended in January when a jury acquitted Peggy
McMartin Buckey of 12 charges. The same jurors acquitted Ray Buckey
of 40 charges and deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   Over the weekend, the parents continued an inch-by-inch search
of the school and its foundation. The school is scheduled for
demolition, and the current owner agreed to let the parents conduct
their search until he brings in the bulldozers.
   More than a dozen former McMartin students had talked to
prosecutors about a trap door, tunnel or secret underground room at
the school, but none was ever found, prosecutors say. Only one
student actually testified at the trial about a secret molestation
room, and he didn't indicate it was underground.
   A search of the school years ago turned up no passageways or
trap doors and no signs that floor tiles had been replaced or
concrete patched, prosecutors said. But the parents refused to give
up.
   The McMartin school is now owned by real estate broker Arnold
Goldstein, who plans to raze it and put up an office building. He
has given the parents until Thursday to do their digging.
   On Sunday, former Los Angeles FBI bureau chief Ted Gunderson,
now a private detective, said disturbed earth was found below the
foundation.
   But he said an expert was prepared to say only that there was
``a probability of a tunnel'' as opposed to something else, such as
a garbage pit.
   Prosecutors have said their current case does not depend on any
evidence that might be uncovered during the investigation of the
site.
   The prosecution has said the retrial can be completed in six
months.

   The springs are gushing but the municipal
tap may go dry as the wine country town of Calistoga, famous for
bottled water and hot mineral baths, watches drought and industry
drain its only reservoir.
   The fizzy water fad has been an economic gold mine for
Calistoga, but it has severely depleted municipal supplies of
drinking water.
   Countless gallons of mineral-rich bottled water are exported
every day, and visitors flock to Calistoga to soak in geothermal
mineral baths.
   Although the bottled water industry is a major contributor to
the water shortage, the water that's brought wealth and fame to
Calistoga isn't the same stuff that flows through local taps, in
part because it can erode and clog heating systems.
   That has contributed to the supply problem, since the bottling
operations of three mineral water companies use drinking water to
clean equipment and rinse bottles.
   The pinch is not nearly as bad as the 1977 drought, but
officials recently extended through June a building moratorium that
was started in an effort to stem the demand for more water.
   The town is using water at a rate officials didn't expect to
reach until after the year 2000, according to City Administrator
Natasha Merkuloff.
   Planners anticipated the drain on water supplies and spent $5
million to tap into the state's North Bay Aqueduct in 1980. The
26-mile pipeline has provided a buffer for the city, which had
relied on one reservoir and a few wells for its water.
   But four years of drought have aggravated the situation, and
stricter state water standards reduced the useful capacity of the
town's Kimball Reservoir, forcing the town to rely more on the
pipeline and less on local supplies.
   Within a year, the city hopes to make $500,000 of improvements
to Kimball Reservoir to expand its supply of usable water by about
50 percent, Merkuloff said.
   Meantime, officials say the 4,500 residents of Calistoga, about
50 miles north of San Francisco, are a conscientious bunch.
   ``You don't see people in Calistoga wasting water like you do in
other places,'' said Jo Ellen Noble in the city's planning
department.
   It will be business as usual as tourists flock to the wine
country retreat's famous spas, she said.
   The drought of 1977 is the standard to which locals compare the
current shortage. Then, residents were limited to 50 gallons of
water per person per day and the town was three weeks shy of having
the state truck in water, Noble said.
   Today, Calistogans use an average of only 90 gallons each per
day, less than half the statewide average.
   Nevertheless, city officials asked industrial users to cut their
water use two years ago after they discovered ``the horrendous use
of water,'' Merkuloff said.
   Calistoga Mineral Water Co. was using the equivalent of 25
percent of the pipeline's entire annual allotment, she said,
although it has since cut in half its water usage and signed a
contract that specifies usage and discharge levels.
   Five-tier water rates charge heavy water users more, she added.
   ``Municipal water has always been a problem in Calistoga,'' said
Calistoga Mineral Water spokesman Bob Pusey. ``It's not something
new. There's always been some form of rationing or moratoriums on
building permits or hookups.''
   At Crystal Geyser Water Co., drinking water use dropped 25
percent last year _ even though mineral water production increased
50 percent _ because it introduced new labeling and cooling
equipment and began recycling water used to rinse bottles, said
chairman Peter Gordon.
   As word of the water pinch leaked beyond city limits, concern
grew about the impact the publicity could have on tourism.
   At Nance's Hot Springs, where mineral water is used in the pool
and bathhouse and only the motel relies on municipal supplies,
clerk Vickie Vowser has had to reassure worried customers that
there's no emergency.
   ``It's going to hurt business,'' she said. ``I'd like to know
who the idiot is who did this.''

   Eleven weeks ago, 47 anti-abortion
protesters put bicycle locks around their necks and chained
themselves together at the Vermont Women's Health Center in
Burlington.
   They were jailed without bail because they refused to identify
themselves in court. That issue was presented Monday to the Vermont
Supreme Court.
   With additional protests, the ranks of the jailed have swelled
to 95, all being held without bail on misdemeanor charges of
unlawful trespass, punishable by 90 days in jail.
   The no-bail detention has sparked more protests and a flood of
court actions that have made this staunch pro-choice state a focus
for the anti-abortion movement.
   The protesters say they have a constitutional right to bail when
charged with a misdemeanor.
   ``The courts are stomping all over our rights as Americans,''
said the Rev. Michael McHugh, 37, leader of the local anti-abortion
movement.
   The no-bail detention, first imposed Feb. 21, has made District
Judge Matthew Katz the movement's Public Enemy No. 1. He says
identities are necessary to ensure that people released on bail
will show up for trial.
   On Monday, lawyers for the protesters urged the high court to
overturn Katz's ruling.
   ``It's time for this court to order that the Vermont
Constitution means what it says,'' Daniel Lynch told the justices.
   But prosecutor Edward Sutton argued that detention without bail
is justified. He said the protesters forfeited their right to bail
when they refused to identify themselves.
   ``It's reasonable for a trial judge to deny bail until they get
basic information,'' he said. There was no indication when the
court would rule.
   Since Feb. 21, eight more demonstrations have been held at
Burlington abortion clinics.
   State officials say these continuing protests prove that the
anti-abortion movement is trying to clog the court system.
   ``We are dealing with people who may have lost their aim,'' said
Sutton. ``It seems to have veered over to trying to punish a state.
Our legal system is under attack.''
   The protesters also have targeted the judge. A series of
``prayer vigils'' outside Katz's Burlington home led to McHugh's
arrest on felony charges of obstructing justice.
   Court records also show that a protester called Katz a ``Jew
bastard'' during a March 22 court hearing. McHugh, in an effort to
defuse accusations that his movement is anti-Semitic, maintains the
court reporter misheard the comment.
   McHugh also has repeatedly denied Vermont is a national target
for the anti-abortion movement.
   ``To imply that national leaders have decided to make Vermont a
rescue focus is absurd,'' McHugh said.
   But only eight of the 95 jailed are Vermonters. The rest are
from Canada, California, Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington state and the Northeast.
   In addition, several national leaders of the anti-abortion
movement are among those jailed, including Joan Andrews, 41, who
helped found the ``rescue'' movement in 1979, and the Rev. Norman
Weslin, 59, head of the Victim Souls for the Unborn Christ Child,
headquartered in Mountlake Terrace, Wash.
   In an interview from the temporary jail, Andrews said she came
to Vermont in response to a ``national call'' from more than 150
groups.
   ``We came up here because they were trying to crush the local
movement,'' she said.
   The imprisonments also led to a recent visit by Randall Terry,
the national leader of Operation Rescue. He berated what he called
Vermont's ``pro-death'' judiciary for carrying out vendettas
against his movement.

<HEAD>NBC May Offer Affiliates 24-Hour News Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC, which once tried to buy 51 percent of Cable
News Network, is planning its own 24-hour news service for its
affiliates, NBC News president Michael Gartner said Monday.
   The affiliates could use the service as part of their own
broadcasts or when NBC is ``dark'' and not broadcasting. The plan
likely will be presented to affiliates at their annual convention,
on June 3-6 in Washington, D.C.
   The proposal drew praise from James R. Sefert, chairman of the
NBC affiliates' board, although he emphasized he didn't have full
details of it. He likened it to an extension of an NBC News service
called A-News, which sends affiliates news reports from NBC News
and NBC affiliates.
   But NBC executives have told him in broad terms what the new
service would be and ``I think it's terrific,'' said Sefert,
president of Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C.
   ``I really can't comment until I see the full proposal,'' he
said when asked if he thought NBC-affiliated stations would approve
the idea. ``But the outline sounded good.''
   ``It's too early to tell,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
when asked about NBC's plan, which could prove a rival for CNN, at
least with NBC affiliates that also take CNN service.
   ``We still are studying it,'' Haworth said. ``But we've
developed very strong relationships with 220 broadcast affiliates
over the 10 years that we've been in business. We're certainly
confident that those relationships will persist.''
   According to Atlanta-based CNN, whose 24-hour news service began
in June 1980, 51 of NBC's 208 affiliates also are CNN affiliates.
   One such double affiliate is WTHR-TV in Indianapolis, whose vice
president and general manager, Michael J. Corken, is head of the
news subcommittee of the NBC affiliate board.
   Corken said it was too early to say what he would do. ``I'd have
to look and see what the viability of the NBC-proposed system would
be,'' he said.
   NBC officials haven't yet told him what they plan, he said.
   NBC's effort to buy part of CNN in 1985 failed in part because
of its insistence that NBC News have editorial control of any
NBC-CNN operation that would result if the purchase went through.
   NBC's plan to start its own 24-hour news service was disclosed
in Monday's editions of The Wall Street Journal.
   Although not available for an interview, Garter, NBC News'
president, confirmed in a statement that such a news service is
planned. It would be an operation that is separate from the
network's regular newscasts.
   ``While many details are yet to be determined, we have an
outline of the plan and hope to have a final plan by the time of
the June affiliates meeting,'' Gartner said.
   Discusions of the plan ``have focused almost exclusively on the
issue of content, the value of our service to the affiliates and
the methods of distribution,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Afghan President Najibullah on Monday
named the governor of Herat province, who was nearly killed in a
rebel ambush in April, to head his Communist-style government,
Radio Kabul reported.
   The state-run radio also said a rocket attack on the Afghan
capital left one person dead and two wounded. The broadcast,
monitored in Islamabad, blamed the rocket attack on U.S.-armed
rebels.
   Fazle Haq Khaliq Yaar's appointment as prime minister follows on
the heels of Sunday's promotion of Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the
vice-presidency.
   The Herat governor was seriously wounded in April when rebels
staged a surprise attack on a ceremony at which thousands of
guerrilla fighters were to surrender.
   Hidden among more than 10,000 defectors at the ceremony in the
northwestern province of Herat were a handful of guerrilla
fighters, pretending to have embraced Najibullah's Soviet-style
government.
   When Khaliq Yaar stepped out of his helicopter to launch the
ceremony, the rebel fighters opened fire. When the shooting stopped
30 minutes later, 110 people were dead and scores were injured.
   Najibullah lost several top military officers in the Herat
shooting.
   Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group, considered one of the strongest
militarily, claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Meanwhile, Moslem guerrillas claimed Monday to have recaptured
ground lost during a week of heavy fighting with Afghan government
troops outside the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   The state-run radio acknowledged the renewed attack but said the
guerrillas had been repulsed and 180 of them killed.
   ``With this operation, the enemy's morale has been completely
broken,'' Radio Kabul claimed. The report could not be
independently verified.
   The radio also said government soldiers captured hundreds of
anti-tank missiles, even more surface-to-surface missiles and
thousands of small arms from the rebel fighters.
   ``Government soldiers are in a strong position and ready for any
kind of opposition attack,'' the radio broadcast said.
   Meanwhile, MIDIA, the news agency of the Afghan resistance, said
guerrillas overran government security outposts 12 miles east of
Jalalabad.
   The report claimed Afghan troops suffered heavy casualties in
the weekend battle. The report did not say whether there were any
guerrilla casualties, and it could not be independently confirmed.
   The radio broadcast, however, said four government soldiers were
killed and another seven wounded in the past five days.
   Fighting around Jalalabad has erupted sporadically since the
rebels launched a major offensive in March 1989 to take the eastern
city.
   Troops loyal to Najibullah repulsed the attack, in which the
U.S.-backed guerrillas suffered some of their heaviest casualties
in 12 years of fighting to unseat the Marxist-style government in
Kabul.
   Kabul's state-run radio reported last week that government
troops had recaptured several key outposts around Jalalabad in the
latest offensive that began May 1.
   But MIDIA said that over the weekend, guerrillas in captured
tanks rolled into government posts in the Khewa district, three
miles north of the city. The report did not mention casualty
figures.
   The agency also reported that government warplanes bombed and
destroyed a stretch of the highway linking Kabul and Jalalabad,
about 45 miles from the border with Pakistan.
   It said the guerrillas had earlier reconstructed the road under
pressure from area tribal leaders who wanted the lucrative trade
route reopened.
   Throughout the war, Afghan traders have continued to ply the
eastern highway from Kabul to the border.

   Pope John Paul II, speaking to a joyous
crowd in one of Mexico's poorest cities, said today that living
conditions for Latin America's urban poor constitute an urgent call
to carry out the church's teachings.
   ``We cannot live and sleep peacefully while thousands of our
brothers, very near to us, lack the necessities for a dignified
human life,'' John Paul told about 200,000 worshippers gathered in
a muddy field 25 miles southeast of Mexico City.
   Thousands waved yellow banners, and mariachi bands played
``Cielito Lindo'' _ or ``Beautiful Sky'' _ as the pope swept in by
helicopter, although gray clouds sometimes obscured the massive,
snow-capped volcanic cones of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.
   The crowd was smaller than predicted, cut down by hours of rain
that lasted into the early morning and turned the normally dusty
valley to mud.
   The theme of the pope's Mass was ``The Good Shepherd.'' Seated
at a microphone next to a giant crucifix under a yellow-and-white
canopy, John Paul told the crowd that the good shepherd could be
distinguished from mercenaries ``because he is ready to give his
life for his sheep.''
   ``Jesus Christ, being rich, made himself poor to enrich us with
his poverty,'' said the pope.
   He called on all Christians and all ``men of good will'' to put
into action the church's ``preferential option for the poor,''
first expounded in Puebla, 50 miles east of here, on John Paul's
first visit to Mexico in 1979.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made a point of
improving life in Chalco, which has expanded from a population of
6,000 in 1975 to more than 60,000 today as poor peasants migrate to
Mexico City's vast urban sprawl. Salinas went to Chalco earlier
this year to dedicate new electric lines, sewers and running water.
   John Paul met with Salinas before flying to Chalco, but neither
made any statements afterward. The two exchanged gifts, the pope
giving Salinas three medallions and receiving three books in return.
   As the pope was leaving for a helicopter ride to Chalco, a young
woman broke through security lines and hugged him. She was quickly
hustled away by guards.
   In a gesture that indicated warmer church-state relations lie
ahead, Salinas changed plans at the last minute and met the pontiff
at the airport Sunday instead of sending his foreign minister.
   Salinas, greeting the pope, said: ``Your visit is a new
encounter with the generosity of a nation of many cultures, plural
visions and deep religious sentiments.''
   Since he took office two years ago, Salinas has encouraged
improved ties with the Vatican while officials have widely ignored
strict decades-old laws that intend to keep the church out of
politics.
   In February, Salinas named a personal representative to the
Vatican, a sign the diplomatic ties Mexico severed in 1926 might
soon be restored.
   During his 13-hour flight to Mexico, the Polish-born pope told
reporters his trip was ``something new and very important ... We
are making efforts to improve relations between the state and the
church.''
   The Roman Catholic Church backed the ruling classes against
Mexico's native population in the 19th century, which is why
restrictions on the church were written into the constitution
during the country's 1910-1920 revolution.
   The 1917 constitution denies recognition to the church and bars
priests from speaking about politics from the pulpit or wearing
robes in public. The church is also barred from owning property.
   But Mexico is a country where some independence leaders were
priests, and where the Catholic church claims 90 percent of
Mexico's 85 million people. The government has thus struck a
working arrangement with the church, which runs schools through
intermediaries while priests speak out on political issues.
   The church is seeking to appeal to the poor and indigenous of
Latin America, and the pope bolstered those efforts with the
beatification of Mexico's most revered Indian, Juan Diego.
   During the beatification at the Basilica of Guadalupe, he urged
Mexicans to emulate that humble 16th-century peasant in their fight
to improve society.
   Later, the pontiff greeted people and watched regional dances
performed in his honor. The crowd cheered him wildly as night
settled on the city.
   ``Mexico knows how to dance. Mexico knows how to pray,'' he
said. ``It knows how to sing. But more than anything it knows how
to shout.''
   The 10-city visit is John Paul's 47th trip outside Italy as
pope, his 10th to Latin America and his second to Mexico, which he
visited first in 1979.
   Along with Juan Diego, the pope beatified a 19th-century priest
and three Indians known as the Child Martyrs of Tlaxcala who died
nearly 450 years ago. Beatification is a possible step toward
sainthood.
   According to legend, Juan Diego carried out-of-season roses to
his bishop from a hill where the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to
him in 1531. When he opened his white cloak, the image of the
Virgin appeared on it.

<HEAD>U.S. Bars Import of Peruvian Treasures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is barring the import of
looted Peruvian archaeologial treasures to protect them from greedy
art dealers and collectors, the administration said Monday.
   ``The import ban is the strongest action possible to assist Peru
in preserving its cultural heritage,'' Bruce S. Gelb, director of
the U.S. Information Agency, said at a news conference.
   The ban affects artifacts being stolen by armed looters from the
Sipan region of Peru, the site of rich, intact pre-Colombian tombs,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Cesar Atala, the Peruvian ambassador to the United States, said
the ban ``will help us avoid the enormous lure of the U.S. market.''
   The President's Cultural Property Advisory Commission found that
the U.S. market for objects looted from the tombs ``is so large it
is encouraging looting in the region,'' Gelb said.
   Intricately crafted gold, gilded copper and silver artifacts
have been discovered at the site.
   Michael H. Lane, deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs, compared
the looting to drug smuggling.
   ``We see the same techniques and the same motive _ greed _ as we
see every day in the smuggling of narcotics,'' Lane said.
   Under the presidential order, requested by Peru, artifacts from
the region will be seized by Customs agents and returned to Peru
unless the items are accompanied by an export permit issued by the
Peruvian government.
   Atala said the looting was preventing archaeologists from
evaluating the material in its original sites and from studying the
Moche culture, its origins and its relationship to other
pre-Colombian cultures.
   Experts have said the tombs, discovered in 1987, have yielded
important information about the civilization that inhabited the
river valleys of northern Peru from 100 to 700 A.D.
   Lane said the ban would not be retroactive, but that objects
from the region already in the United States would be affected if
the artifacts are proved to have been stolen.
   The United States imposed emergency restrictions on monumental
pre-Colombian artifacts from El Salvador in 1987 and on some Andean
textiles from Bolivia last year. Similar requests from Canada and
Guatemala are pending.

<TEXT>
   Former President Carter was named Monday the
1990 recipient of the Philadelphia Liberty Medal for his
involvement in ``issues of liberty around the globe.''
   Carter will receive the medal and a $100,000 cash award on the
Fourth of July at Independence Hall.
   The medal, established in 1988, honors an individual or
organization that has ``demonstrated leadership or vision in the
pursuit of liberty of conscience or freedom from oppression,
ignorance or deprivation.''
   The first medal was given last year to Polish leader Lech Walesa.
   ``President Carter was cited for his active involvement during
the past few years in issues of liberty around the globe and his
exemplary use of the post-presidential period,'' said Martin
Meyerson, president emeritus of the University of Pennsylvania and
chairman of the 12-member selection commission.
   The commission is made up of leaders from government, world
affairs, education and business.
   The award was established by We the People 2000, a non-profit
group that tries to heighten recognition of the principles that
founded the nation. The cash grant has been underwritten by the
Bell Atlantic Corp.
   Carter has acted as a mediator in Ethiopia, Latin America, the
Middle East and the Sudan since leaving office. He is a ``man of
many and diverse roles,'' said Meyerson.
   ``One day he is a mediator attempting to strike peace between
rival factions,'' Myerson said. ``The next he may be found
discussing human rights issues with a head of state.
   ``On another, he may be dealing with the realities of famine,
poverty, disease control and other issues which haunt the Third
World countries.''

   Two peregrine falcon chicks have
hatched on the ledge of a downtown office building, to the delight
of local cable television watchers.
   They are the second pair of chicks to be raised on the 21st
floor of the Monarch Place office tower. Last year, the parent
falcons chose the spot to raise the first two chicks in half a
century to be hatched in western Massachusetts.
   For the second straight year, Continental Cablevision kept a
camera on the nest 24 hours a day, broadcasting the birds'
activities on a local access channel.
   The show is one of the company's most popular, and this spring
it began showing the birds on local access channels in four
communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
   General Manager Brian Lambert said viewers reported the first
chick hatched about 7 p.m. Saturday and the second about 3 p.m.
Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Latvia's Parliament today assured Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that despite the republic's
declaration of independence, it will respect Soviet interests and
hopes to open talks soon.
   The parliament's message was in response to a request from
Gorbachev for information on Latvia's May 4 declaration of
independence.
   ``We express the certainty that the character of the
declaration, the retention of current constitutional norms and
sincere desire to respect the interests of the U.S.S.R. will meet
with your understanding and open the way to a fruitful dialogue in
the spirit of honest cooperation between equals,'' the letter to
Gorbachev said.
   Latvian president Anatoly Gorbunov had told the parliament this
morning of the Kremlin's request and charged several deputies with
preparing a reply.
   Dainis Ivans, chairman of the Latvian Popular Front, which has
led the independence drive, called Gorbachev's request for more
information ``wonderful.''
   ``This gives us a chance to present our point of view,'' he told
reporters.
   Ivans said Latvia also planned to send a delegation to Moscow
within days and he believed the group would be received by the
Kremlin.
   Delegates from Lithuania, which has also voted to secede, went
through a similar exchange with the Kremlin but to no avail.
   Unlike Lithuania, however, Latvia did not suspend the Soviet
constitution when it declared independence, instead merely adding
several sections calling for independence and democracy.
   Gorbunov and other Latvian leaders have said the republic's
declaration, with its unspecified transition period to full
independence, is calculated to ``leave the door open'' to talks
with the Kremlin.
   They said today the Kremlin's request for an explanation
indicated Moscow's reaction might not be as stong as initially
indicated.
   Latvia's Communist Party chief, Alfreds Rubiks, had said
Saturday that Gorbachev might retaliate because of the secession
vote.
   The Soviet news agency Tass quoted Rubiks as saying in a
statement on television Gorbachev told him the vote violated the
Soviet Constitution. Gorbachev said in a telephone call he might
impose political, economic and administrative sanctions if the
Baltic republic didn't reverse its course, Rubiks reported.
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, at a briefing
today, declined to answer questions about Latvia.``There is no
official response yet,'' he said.
   He said Rubik's statement was ``not a direct response'' to the
republic's declaration of independence.
   Neighboring Lithuania declared immediate independence from
Moscow on March 11, and Gorbachev responded by sending troops to
occupy some Communist Party buildings and by cutting off fuel and
other vital supplies.
   The third Baltic republic, Estonia, last month declared its
intention to secede but set no date and left the door open for
negotiations with the Kremlin.
   As the Latvian Parliament convened today, about 50 Soviet
soldiers approached the building and unfurled a red banner reading,
``Comrades! Have No Doubt We Will Defend the Interests of the
U.S.S.R. With Honor.''
   Thousands of Soviet troops are stationed in Latvia.
   Several Latvians, incensed by the ominous tone of the slogan,
shouted, ``Shame!'' in Russian at the soldiers. The argument
remained peaceful.
   Even before Gorbunov's announcement, Latvian deputies were
discounting Rubiks' report that Gorbachev had immediately rejected
the Latvian declaration and threatened sanctions.
   Legislator Janis Krumins said Latvians who spoke with Valentin
Falin, head of the International Department of the Soviet Communist
Party Central Committee in Moscow, thought Gorbachev's reaction
would not be as harsh as Rubiks had reported.
   ``To threaten that there could be a blockade without having
fully understood what happened here would be irresponsible,'' said
Ivars Kezbers, a Latvian lawmaker who has been involved in talks
with Moscow.
   Lithuanian lawmaker Nikolai Medvedev, visiting the Latvian
capital of Riga, said it appeared that although the three Baltic
republics have taken different approaches to their independence
drives, ``the answer is the same.''
   He said separatists in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were
forging political and economic ties with such Russian cities as
Moscow and Leningrad, where democrats who support the republics'
right to self-determination have come to power through popular
election.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed the Baltic republics in 1940.
They began campaigning for independence shortly after Gorbachev
began his reforms. The Soviet president has offered them a greater
say in economic and political decisions but not secession itself.
   Of Latvia's 2.6 million residents, 53 percent are ethnic
Latvians and 33 percent ethnic Russians. Many of the non-Latvians,
especially Russians, oppose secession.

<HEAD>Syria Refuses to Attend Arab Summit in Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria announced Monday it will not attend
an Arab summit in Baghdad, capital of its archrival Iraq, hindering
efforts to patch up the 11-year-old feud that has blocked Arab
unity.
   Officials said Damascus instead proposed that the foreign
ministers of the 22 Arab League members meet in Tunis to decide on
an alternative summit site.
   In Amman, Jordan's King Hussein insisted the summit be held in
Baghdad as planned, reflecting a deepening rift in the Arab world
over the issue.
   ``The upcoming Arab summit will be held in Baghdad and there is
no intention whatsoever to change the location to somewhere else,''
Hussein said in a statement broadcast by state-run Jordan
Television.
   ``I hope that Arab leaders will work to make this upcoming
summit a successful one and I also hope that our brethren in Syria
and Iraq will reconcile soon,'' said Hussein.
   The Syrian decision stymied efforts led by Saudi Arabia, Egypt
and Jordan to mediate a reconciliation between Syrian President
Hafez Assad and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. They are the Arab
world's most bitter foes.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency quoted Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa as telling Arab League Secretary-General Chadli
Klibi: ``Fixing a venue for the summit without prior
consultations... has cast a negative atmosphere in advance of the
conference, and this certainly is not in the interest of the Arab
nation.''
   Sharaa, SANA added, suggested that ``the Arab League Council
convene to conduct consultations on a convenient venue and date for
the summit and to agree on the topics to be discussed at the
forum.''
   The council groups 21 foreign ministers plus the Palestine
Liberation Organization's political department chief, who is
regarded as a foreign minister in the Arab world.
   Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt have been making strenuous
efforts to persuade Assad to go to Baghdad and end his feud with
Saddam.
   That dispute and Assad's 7-year-old feud with PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat are the main obstacles to Arab efforts to forge a new
unity after years of fragmentation.
   Arafat has been at odds with Assad since 1983, when
Syrian-backed radical Palestinian factions mutinied against Arafat
and drove his guerrillas out of their last Lebanese stronghold.
   Assad has not recognized the Palestinian state declared in 1988
and still holds about 2,000 of Arafat's loyalists in his prisons.
   Syria and Iraq have been at odds since 1979. The two countries
are ruled by different wings of the Arab Baath Socialist Party and
are traditional rivals for political leadership of the modern Arab
world.
   Syria backed Persian Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Iraq
supplied weapons to Lebanese Christian Gen. Michel Aoun in his
effort to force the Syrian army out of Lebanon last year.
   Arafat called in April for a summit to be held in Baghdad to
discuss Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel, Middle East peace moves
and the crisis in Lebanon.
   The Iraqis have said they also want to discuss perceived threats
from Israel and the West against them.
   Saddam wants to demonstrate that the Arab world is behind him
amid what he views as a concerted Western campaign against him over
his drive to build up his military arsenal.
   Saddam claims the Western effort is aimed at setting the stage
for an Israeli attack to neutralize Iraq's burgeoning military
power.

<TEXT>
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
says he's worried that Americans may be losing their tolerance for
people with AIDS.
   ``I fear a growing resentment against all AIDS patients, but
blacks and Hispanics in particular,'' Koop said Sunday while
accepting the 17th Annual Harry S. Truman Award for Public Service.
   Koop said Americans have been tolerant of health problems caused
by drinking and overeating, but may not be so tolerant of AIDS
because of the way it is usually spread, through high-risk sexual
contact and intravenous drug use.
   ``A person becomes infected with HIV by doing things most people
don't do,'' Koop said, adding that unlike diseases that can be
treated, ``there is no rescue from AIDS.''
   However, he said that poverty is the main reason for the spread
of AIDS among minorities. He added that the disease poses the
biggest challenge ever to public health care.
   Koop, who served as U.S. Surgeon General from 1981 until 1989,
said he knew he would be remembered for his campaign against
smoking and his work for education about AIDS, a disease that
``could break the social compact of America.''
   Koop is now chairman of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign, a board
member of AIDS Care Education and Training, and chairman of the
National Museum of Health and Medicine Foundation.
   Sunday's ceremony at the Truman Library also honored Dr. Wallace
Graham, who served as Truman's personal physician during his White
House years.

   When the exclusive Inn at Little
Washington opened in an abandoned garage in 1978, some of the 250
residents of this northwestern Virginia hamlet considered its
nameplate, well, belittling.
   The sign, and the residents' fury, eventually faded.
   But now the award-winning inn, some of whose celebrity guests
travel the 67 miles from Washington, D.C., by helicopter, is again
provoking the wrath of neighbors who fear for the town's seclusion
and its 200-year-old heritage.
   The Mobil Travel guide ranks it as the only five-star inn in the
country. Craig Claiborne, former food columnist of The New York
Times, called it ``one of the most exciting retreats in all of
America.'' Paul Newman, who celebrated a birthday there, called it
``a most satisfying slice of comfort and royalty.''
   Rooms cost $210 to $490 a night, dinner will set you back $68 on
weeknights and $88 on Saturdays, and the waiting list is
lengthening, said innkeepers Patrick O'Connell and Reinhardt Lynch.
They want to triple the capacity of the 10-room inn by adding 22
rooms and a pool.
   ``We thought the town would be absolutely thrilled to have
something magnificent,'' O'Connell said. ``What is so astonishing
is people drive in, stay overnight and leave. This doesn't impact
the schools or police. It's clean tourism dollars.''
   But opponents cannot stomach an expansion, even if it is
designed to fit in with its homely surroundings.
   The Town Council on Wednesday considers the necessary zoning
change. It has a year to make a decision.
   ``I think it's a little too great for this small town,'' said
Kermit Weakley, a 20-year resident.
   The inn became the key point in recent local elections. Both
former Councilman William Wickens, who once proposed a ban on the
helicopter landings, and Lynch lost a bid for the council.
   Others cannot understand the fuss.
   ``You'd think we were talking about a high-rise Holiday Inn,''
said Charles Eldred, who owns a shop and a house across from the
inn. ``They're wonderful neighbors.''
   Mayor Dean Morehouse favors a middle course _ a limited
expansion.
   ``One thing we don't want to end up with is a huge white
elephant in the middle of our small town,'' he said. The inn
generates $65,000 of the town's $130,000 budget, he said.
   The four-block town has a restaurant, beauty salon and bank but
no traffic lights. Its theater has a volunteer staff and is open
only on Friday and Saturday nights.
   Official letterheads describe the town as ``The First Washington
of All,'' and residents proudly say George Washington surveyed it
himself.
   When they decided to start the inn, Lynch and O'Connell were
running a catering business from their nearby farm.
   Their creation produced instant hostility when they hung out the

O'Connell said they used the name affectionately. Besides, the sign
cost $1,000, or about a fifth of their net worth in 1978, he said.
   Today, their worth is more than $3 million, and the inn has a
staff of 55.
   The inn has 24-hour room service. Each of the European-style
rooms is lavishly furnished with English antiques. The canopied
beds are draped with imported fabrics. The bathrooms, some with
Jacuzzis, are done in brass and marble.
   ``We want to offer personal service, much like being in
someone's grand country house, but also offer the discerning
traveler anything they can find in a luxury hotel with more
charm,'' O'Connell said.

<HEAD>Roh Warns of ``Chaos'' But Radicals Step Up Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday that
South Korea must choose between progress or ``the road toward
chaos,'' but dissidents and radical students stepped up violent
protests demanding his ouster.
   Radicals armed with firebombs, steel pipes and rocks battled
riot police and attacked governing party offices in Seoul and
several other cities. Dissidents vowed to hold anti-Roh rallies
this week across the nation.
   As Roh spoke in a nationally televised address, 21 students
armed with firebombs and iron pipes charged into the Seoul
headquarters of Roh's Liberal Democratic Party and seized a
third-floor office.
   Riot police overpowered the protesters with clubs and tear gas
about 10 minutes later. Witnesses said five people, including
protesters and police officers, were injured.
   Office windows, furniture and the windshields of three cars were
smashed and a guard post was burned.
   The protesters scattered leaflets demanding the ouster of U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg. They accused him of concocting this year's
merger of the governing party with two minor opposition groups. The
merger resulted in a large conservative governing party.
   About 2,500 students fought police with firebombs and rocks
outside campuses in four provincial cities and two small towns
outside Seoul, said Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Radical students firebombed Liberal Democratic Party offices in
two other cities _ Taejon and Wonju, Yonhap said. There was minor
damage but no injuries or arrests were reported.
   ``Right now we are in a difficult time,'' Roh, surrounded by
Cabinet members, said in his speech. ``We are on a crossroad where
the country can either be on a road toward progress or fall into a
road toward chaos.''
   Dissident groups called for new protests Wednesday in 17 cities
aimed at forcing the governing party to disband. Dissidents contend
the three-party merger in January was an attempt by government
conservatives to prolong power.
   A statement released Monday and signed by 1,041 professors
nationwide also demanded the ruling party's dissolution.
   Roh said the recent ``heightening of uneasiness'' had been
partly caused by labor unrest at a shipyard and at the state-run
broadcast network, KBS. He called for industrial peace and firm
action against illegal strikes.
   In Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, shipyard workers
began dialogue with company executives to negotiate an end to a
9-day-old protest. At least 50 workers were perched atop a large
crane.
   Company officials reported little progress, saying the workers
insisted that charges against union leaders be dropped. They said
the workers also asked the company to withdraw police and guarantee
they would not be arrested.
   The Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard remained at a
standstill Monday, with most of its 20,000 union members staying
home, witnesses said by telephone.
   The workers climbed atop the crane after thousands of riot
police fired tear gas and stormed the shipyard April 28 to end a
strike demanding the release of union leaders arrested in earlier
protests.
   The police assault triggered sympathy strikes in many other
industrial plants, but most workers returned to their jobs by the
end of last week.
   In Seoul, the state-run KBS network remained crippled by
striking workers. Union leaders at the two other broadcast networks
announced an end to their sympathy strikes Monday.
   The KBS protest began April 12, when police raided the network
to arrest workers denouncing their new chief as anti-reform. Police
arrested 468 KBS workers, but most were released later.

   Greyhound's chairman declared victory today in the
2-month-old bus drivers' strike, but the union said the bitter
walkout was by no means over.
   ``The strike is over, or at least it is irrelevant,'' said
Greyhound Lines Inc. Chairman Fred Currey. The company no longer is
``driver-inhibited'' and is operating as if there were no strike,
Currey said at a news conference at Greyhound's headquarters.
   The statement came two days after the company proposed a
four-year wage freeze and the elimination of 4,500 union jobs, a
proposal the union called an ``insult.''
   The union said the strike was far from over, noting the
company's recently announced $56 million quarterly loss. In
Washington, spokesman Nick Nichols said Currey should review the
bus line's financial documents and look at picket lines for a truer
picture of the strike.
   ``Then, quite frankly, he should jump on a bus and try and
travel across the country and see how far he gets,'' said Nichols,
a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.
   ``We hope his conclusion will be to get back to the bargaining
table,'' he added. As for the company's claim that the strike is
now irrelevant, Nichols said that the company has been saying for
weeks that it could operate without its striking drivers, but that
the company's losses were proof that wasn't true.
   In his announcement, Currey declared ``a new day in the life of
the new Greyhound,'' which he said is currently serving the cities
that brought in 98 percent of its revenue last year. Total revenue
is about 70 percent of last year.
   ``We're putting the events of the last two months behind us,''
Currey said.
   Some 6,300 drivers have been on strike since March 2.
   Despite proclaiming the strike over, Currey said the company
would be willing to negotiate with the union and there would be
some jobs available for drivers during the summer. The company has
hired hundreds of new drivers since the strike began.
   Union leaders had said Sunday that the Greyhound offer would
force drivers to continue their walkout, which has been marked by
violence and bitter trading of accusations.
   But Greyhound Vice President Anthony P. Lannie had said the
union should salvage the 1,300 jobs the company is offering ``or
there won't be any jobs'' for striking drivers. Remaining jobs will
be filled by non-union workers if the strike continues, he said.
   Union President Edward M. Strait had said he would not relay the
weekend proposal to the drivers for a vote, because ``they'd throw
me out the upstairs window. ... It's an insult.'' He caled the
company ``greedy'' and said officials ``don't care about their
employees.''
   Union members will ``stay out on the picket line and hope
something changes,'' Strait said Sunday. Bargaining talks were
halted indefinitely Saturday after the company made its latest
offer.
   Lannie also said Sunday the company is abandoning charter
service in all but 19 of the 197 cities where it was offered.
   Greyhound had said earlier that it would not restore service, at
least anytime soon, for about 30 percent of its pre-strike miles
which had been unprofitable. But Currey said today that the towns
left unserved by Greyhound would not necessarily be left without
transportation as the company would work to establish van service
or other alternatives.
   In addition to cutting the unprofitable miles, Curry said, the
company plans to reduce its practice of running additional buses in
peak periods when buses are full. Now, passengers will have to wait
until the next scheduled bus departs, he said.
   Saturday's bargaining talks were the first since mid-March and
followed Friday's announcement by the company that it lost $56
million for the first three months of this year.
   Greyhound's offer would give drivers $12.79 an hour rather than
their previous 30-cents-a-mile rate, Lannie said. He said the total
the typical driver would take home under the new way of calculating
pay would be about the same, but Strait contended the company's
offer amounts to a wage cut for some employees.
   The company's financial situation and move to reduce services
are forcing it to eliminate about 2,000 of its 6,000 driver jobs,
Lannie said.
   An additional 2,500 union jobs would go to non-union replacement
drivers the company hired after the strike began, Lannie said,
adding that the 500 union members who crossed picket lines also
would be kept.
   The bus line told union negotiators it had immediate openings
for only 620 striking drivers and probably could take an additional
700 back within a few months.
   Although 4,500 union jobs would be eliminated, 2,000 striking
drivers have ``already written Greyhound off'' and found other
jobs, Lannie said. An additional 2,500 strikers are either at
retirement age or eligible for early retirement incentives the
company is offering, he said.

that it was a question of ``days.''
   He added that the EC was also working on a ``coordinated

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of delighted pupils
returned to Sullivans Island Elementary School on Monday, nearly
eight months after Hurricane Hugo battered it with 135 mph wind and
a 12-foot wall of water.
   ``It took something like Hurricane Hugo to make us realize what
sort of friends we have,'' Principal Fleming Harris said of the
parents and teachers who helped clean up the school.
   ``We're home and we're going to be back better than ever.''
   The school, which stands about two blocks from the Atlantic
Ocean, required $1 million worth of repairs after the Sept. 21
storm. Most homes on the island of 1,900 residents were damaged by
the storm, which left 29 dead and an estimated $5.9 billion damage
in South Carolina.
   All the other schools in the state that were damaged by the
hurricane had already reopened, said Raymond L. Morton, spokesman
for the state Department of Education.
   Until Monday, Sullivans pupils had to attend a school in Mount
Pleasant, on the mainland side of the island.
   ``I've never seen a bunch of students happier to get back in
school,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who led the pupils in
the Pledge of Allegiance outside the school. ``It's an inspiration
to us how you joined hands and made it.''
   Before going inside for a special pancake breakfast, the
school's 360 pupils listened to speeches and a high school pep band.
   ``It's been a long time since September. This is a time for
celebration,'' Harris said.
   ``We're Back At the Beach to Teach,'' said a sign inside the
school.
   While summer vacation begins in about a month, school officials
said it was important the pupils return as quickly as possible.
   Mayor Melvin Anderegg said it was amazing how many people came
from around the country to help rebuild the community.
   ``It's great to welcome you today to show the fruits of their
work,'' he said.
   Pupils milling about outside the school laughed and smiled.
   ``I'm really happy we're back,'' said third-grader Tamara
Kendalls, who ``wasn't crazy'' about having to attend another
school for most of the year.
   ``We're real glad'' to be back, agreed classmate Brian Austin.
   ``It feels real good,'' said another third-grader, Clint Gaskins.
   Parents helped spruce up the grounds at the school and, in
recent weeks, read to pupils and conducted other activities to give
teachers a chance to return to the repaired building to organize
their classrooms.
   ``I just started to sob when I arrived'' Monday morning, said
Corday Rice, the mother of a fourth-grader. ``I said it was the pep
band playing off-key but I know it wasn't that.''
   While the school has been repaired, evidence of the hurricane is
not hard to find on the island. Sullivans Island and the other
barrier islands were the first land to feel Hurricane Hugo's wrath.
   Tree limbs and water-logged home furnishings still clutter many
yards, and the sound of hammers and power saws fill the air as
workers continue to rebuild.

<HEAD>Berlin Officials Set Target Date for Dropping Border Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in East and West Berlin said Monday
they have set a target date of July 2 to drop all border controls
and provide full free access between the two sides of the city.
   The comments came after East Germany's first free local
elections, in which the Social Democrats emerged as the strongest
party in East Berlin.
   The Social Democrats, who won 34.3 percent of the vote in
Sunday's local elections in East Berlin, offered coalition talks to
other major groups in a move designed to keep the Communists out of
the local government.
   The Communists, now called the Party of Democratic Socialism,
came in second in East Berlin balloting with 29.9 percent of the
vote.
   Nationwide, the conservative Christian Democratic Union of new
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere finished by far as the strongest
party. But it suffered losses compared with the votes it received
in March 18 national parliamentary elections.
   The party dropped about 7 percent from the 41 percent of the
vote it received March 18.
   The leftist-leaning Social Democrats finished second in local
elections and the reformed Communists were third, repeating the
outcome of the March 18 ballot. The Social Democrats had their
strongest showing in East Berlin.
   The Communists have governed East Berlin since East Germany was
founded in 1949 and the former Soviet zone of the divided city was
proclaimed its capital.
   The hard-line national Communist government was ousted by a
peaceful revolution last fall that culminated in the opening of the
Berlin Wall.
   The Communists were formally removed from power after the March
18 ballot but ran local governments across the country until
Sunday's vote to choose new administrations.
   The Social Democratic candidate for mayor in East Berlin, Tino
Schwierzina, told reporters he would start coalition talks Tuesday
with all parties, with the exception of the Communists.
   Accompanied by West Berlin mayor Walter Momper, a West German
Social Democrat, Schwierzina said the first coalition talks would
be with the Christian Democrats and the leftist Alliance 90.
   If Schwierzina forms a three-party governing coalition, it would
hold 85 of the 138 seats in East Berlin's legislature.
   Schwierzina and Momper said such a majority would allow the
local government to quickly open all remaining barriers between
East and West Berlin.
   Momper said the two set a target date of ``at the latest July 2
to eliminate all border controls'' between East Berlin and West
Berlin.
   Schwierzina he would push for quick opening of the remaining 140
sections of the Berlin Wall and other barriers blocking streets
between West Berlin and East Germany.
   ``This condition will soon be ended,'' Schwierzina said. ``The
wall must go as quickly as possible.''
   Schwierzina also said that plans call for joining East and West
Berlin's public transportation systems by this fall, including the
subway and streetcar systems.

<HEAD>American Workers' Productivity Declines by Annual Rate of 1
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers' productivity continued to
lag in the first three months of 1990, posting its worst
performance in a year, the government said Monday.
   ``It's a reminder of what we already knew _ that the economy
isn't doing too well,'' said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw
Hill.
   Non-farm productivity _ defined as output per hour of work _
declined by 1 percent, the biggest drop since productivity fell by
an annual rate of 1.3 percent for the January-March period last
year.
   During all of last year, productivity rose just 0.9 percent, the
poorest showing since the 1981-82 recession.
   Increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their
output rises without risking higher inflation.
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust,
said productivity sometimes plunges in a quarter because of
statistical quirks, but the nation's continuing anemic productivity
pace is distressing.
   ``In the long term, we should be very concerned because we're
not being efficient enough to increase our living standard. It's
also making it difficult to compete with other countries,'' Kellner
said.
   Meanwhile, unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price
inflation, rose a sharp 4.9 percent so far this year, the report
said, compared with a 4.5 percent increase during all of 1989.
   ``It suggests a rock-hard underlying inflation rate of 4.5 to 5
percent,'' economist Allen Sinai said of the increase in unit labor
costs. ``It's not likely to get much better anytime soon without
the economy getting more productivity.''
   However, Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., noted that
hourly labor costs _ a major inflation measure for businesses _
rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 1990.
   He called the 3.9 percent rise a bright spot, noting those costs
increased by 5.5 percent for all of 1989.
   Economists were also encouraged by the report's figures on
productivity in the manufacturing sector, which showed that factory
workers registered a seasonally adjusted 4.1 percent increase so
far this year.
   Although calling the decline in the productivity rate extremely
disappointing, Sinai said it was not unusual for an economy using
most of its workers, plants and equipment.
   The nation's unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in April,
relatively close to the 5 percent jobless rate many economists
consider full employment.
   Low unemployment holds back productivity because ``companies are
tapping the bottom of the barrel in terms of qualified workers,''
Sinai said.
   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.8 percent a year.
While a slight improvement over the 1.2 percent average growth rate
in the 1970s, it was still far below the 3.3 percent rate of
increase posted in the two decades after World War II when American
workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a rising standard of living
during those decades.
   Output in the non-farm sector rose 2.7 percent during the first
quarter of 1989, well below the 3.6 percent increase in the number
of hours worked, the Labor Department said.

<HEAD>China Tightens Rules on Travel To Tibet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities in Tibet announced strict new
controls Monday on foreign travel to the region, saying each
traveler must submit an application in advance to local authorities.
   The new rules apply even to ordinary tourists, making it
unlikely that tourism will get back to the levels of before March
1989, when martial law was imposed to end pro-independence rioting.
Martial law was lifted just last week.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Tang Zhengqi, deputy
secretary-general of the regional government, as saying the
controls were imposed because Tibet has limited capacity to
accommodate foreign travelers.
   However, authorities clearly were concerned about contact
between foreigners and Tibetans who have demonstrated repeatedly
over the past three years for independence. China has accused
``hostile foreign forces'' of scheming to help Tibetan separatists.
   Several Tibetan cities were opened to foreign travelers in 1983.
They immediately became popular destinations for backpackers
traveling overland from Nepal and for package tours flying in from
the Chinese city of Chengdu.
   About 30,000 tourists visited Tibet in 1986, the last year
unmarred by bloody clashes between Tibetan nationalists and Chinese
security forces.
   China says its sovereignty over Tibet dates to the 13th century.
Tibetan nationalists say the region was actually independent much
of that time and should be now.
   Authorities expelled all foreigners from Tibet's capital, Lhasa,
when martial law was declared on March 8, 1989, and has allowed
only a small number of tour groups to visit since. The cold-water
hostels where foreign backpackers used to stay have closed for lack
of business. The Western-style Lhasa Hotel, run by Holiday Inn, has
been nearly empty.
   Travelers who have visited recently have been given printed
notices at the Lhasa airport warning them to not to ``endanger the
national security ... Spread words harmful to our national dignity,
sovereignty, territorial integrity, or interfere in our national
affairs.'' The notices also warn foreigners not to ``take drugs or
go whoring.''
   Tang said tourists should present their applications to visit
Tibet to the regional tourism administration. In practice,
authorities have been requiring such applications for several
weeks, according to Westerners who said they were given forms by
the travel agency arranging their trip.
   The main purpose appeared to be to screen journalists traveling
as tourists. Authorities have allowed few journalists into Tibet
since September 1987, when the first of increasingly frequent
pro-independence demonstrations was held.
   Four of the demonstrations since then have ended in bloody
clashes between Tibetans and Chinese security. Tibetans say more
than 60 people have died. Hundreds have been arrested.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor,
hospitalized for a month with a near-fatal bout of pneumonia, will
be released this week from St. John's Hospital and Health Center, a
publicist said Monday.
   ``She's doing much, much better. She will get out in the next

still getting a lot of mail.''
   Miss Taylor, 58, who was reported near death at the hospital on
April 22, will continue her recuperation at her Beverly Hills home.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
and ``Butterfield 8'' entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on
April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and
she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.

Increases</HEAD>

   Many state lawmakers have become ``reluctant warriors'' for
election-year tax increases. Plans include extending Rhode Island's
sales tax to Bibles and broad-based levies on gasoline in
California and income in Massachusetts.
   ``You can't live like a millionaire if you're not one,'' said
New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat who wants to raise $1.16
billion in new taxes mostly by increasing the sales tax from 6
percent to 7 percent.
   Massachusetts lawmakers have balked at raising taxes even as the
state has earned the lowest bond rating in the nation by falling
$800 million to $900 million short of cash to pay bills. New York's
legislators have kicked around a $1 billion revenue increase far
beyond an April 1 budget deadline.
   Texas deadlocked on school financing. Illinois got hung up on a
phone tax. Florida and Massachusetts hit the brakes on gas tax
increases. South Carolina faced a multiple choice and picked none
of the above.
   Proposals for new revenues also are pending in Connecticut,
Kansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   The need for new revenues stems mostly from the Northeast's
economic slowdown and Sun Belt growth that requires expanded state
services.
   ``There's nobody going to stand up here and embrace a tax, but I
think people realize the magnitude of the problem we're facing,''
said Florida House Appropriations Committee Chairman T.K.
Wetherell. ``You're going to see some reluctant warriors.''
   A researcher who tracks state budgets says many states this year
are putting off inevitable hard choices because they have enough
reserves to get by or would rather wait until after gubernatorial
elections in November.
   ``What we're seeing this year is sort of a teaser for what we're
going to see next year,'' said Marcia Howard, research director
with the National Association of State Budget Officers in
Washington, D.C.
   ``One thing that surprises me is that I know of two states
already that have raised their sales tax rates,'' she said,
referring to Texas and Georgia. ``It's not as easy to raise your
sales tax rate as it is some other thing. So it can be viewed as
pretty dramatic.''
   Rather than hiking a broad-based tax on sales or income, some
states are targeting items such as alcohol and gasoline that only
fuel some of the people some of the time.
   Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete steadfastly refuses to
consider anything called a tax increase. But the Republican
governor has persuaded his Democrat-controlled General Assembly to
approve increasing fees for such things as auto registrations to
stave off a $100 million deficit.
   Some legislators proposed expanding the state sales tax by
closing exemptions on such purchases as Bibles and 12-meter yachts.
A study says that could raise as much as $15 million.
   New York lawmakers, facing a $1.5 billion deficit, are piecing
together multiple sources of income that will cost the average New
Yorker more than $55 extra this year. The increase includes a
corporate tax surcharge of 15 percent, the freeze of an income tax
cut that was due this year and a broadening of the state sales tax
to cover such things as public relations firms and custom computer
programming.
   Florida has a nearly $1 billion puzzle of revenue increases. The
more imaginative pieces are motorist fees such as a $195 ``impact
fee'' on any car brought into the state on which Florida sales
taxes have not been paid.
   Last week, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who is fighting for
re-election, vetoed a $4.7 billion plan that contained a
4-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase.
   Gas taxes are of limited help in closing state budget deficits
because they often are earmarked by law for highways _ an
arrangement guarded by trucking and auto lobbyists.
   Nevertheless, Massachusetts Democrats are working on a tax plan
that combines a 20 percent rise in the state income tax and a
10-cent gas tax increase from the current rate of 11 cents a gallon.
   In California, voters will decide in the June 5 primary whether
to relax an 11-year-old constitutional spending limit to allow the
doubling of the state gasoline tax to 18 cents a gallon. The
measure is aimed at raising an extra $15.5 billion during the next
10 years for roads and transportation, but probably would free
money for other programs.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mills College students kept control of
the campus Monday in their protest against the trustees' decision
to admit male undergraduates for the first time in the school's
138-year history.
   Students, who blockaded administration buildings and boycotted
classes to halt activities at the liberal arts college, said they
will demonstrate through graduation, May 20, or until the decision
is reversed.
   ``Right now we do not want to compromise,'' said sophomore
Deborah Egbert, spokeswoman for the Associated Students of Mills
College. She estimated 300 students are continuing the
demonstration that began Thursday.
   Administrators met with students during the weekend in an
unsuccessful attempt to end the demonstration, according to Mills
spokeswoman Vickie Bates.
   Finals are scheduled to begin Friday. Bates said teachers are
considering whether to let students make up assignments, take final
grades based on previous school work or proceed with end-of-term
tests.
   Most of Mills' 777 female undergraduates oppose the decision to
admit male undergraduates in the fall of 1991. The trustees want to
boost enrollment to 1,000 students, which would help balance the
school's $24 million annual budget.

   Chrysler Corp. is recalling eight models of
1985 Plymouths and Dodges that have flunked federal exhaust
emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency announced
Monday.
   The recall to replace part of the carburetor choke system
affects 383,700 vehicles: the Plymouth Horizon, Turismo, Reliant
and Reliant wagon; and the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries and Aries
wagons, the EPA said.
   Chrysler agreed to the recall after the cars, all with 2.2-liter
engines, exceeded the allowed hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
exhaust emission levels in routine EPA tests, the agency said.
   The recall does not affect cars sold in California.
   The manufacturer will replace the choke vacuum delay valve,
which allows a richer mixture of fuel and air when the engine is
started cold. Chrysler has designed an improved valve, the EPA
said. The work is to be done free by Chrysler-Plymouth or Dodge
dealers.
   Hydrocarbons, when combined with sunlight and other pollutants,
contribute to the formation of smog. The EPA says that excessive
carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere impair heart functions and
are harmful to people with lung disease, anemia and peripheral
vascular disease.

<HEAD>World Jewish Congress: Economic Hardship Has Fueled Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World Jewish Congress officials said Monday
economic hardship has fueled anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe and
they planned a solemn ceremony at the site where Nazis plotted the
extermination of the Jews.
   On the second day of the congress' annual meeting, a U.S.
Justice Department official said Washington has rejected Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim's repeated requests for a lifting of the
ban that keeps him out of the country. The official said the ban
remains in effect because of Waldheim's role ``Nazi-sponsored
persecution.''
   The three-day meeting in Berlin is the Congress' first in
Germany since the organization was founded in Switzerland in 1936
amid the horrors of the Third Reich.
   Some delegates declined to attend, saying a visit to Berlin, the
former Nazi capital, would be too traumatic. Six million Jews were
killed by the Nazis between January 1933 and May 1945.
   On Tuesday, Congress officials will visit Berlin's Wannsee
Villa, where on Jan. 20, 1942 leading Nazi officials plotted the
Third Reich's so-called Final Solution to exterminate Jews
worldwide.
   A solemn ceremony at the villa will coincide with the 45th
anniversary of the Nazis' unconditional surrender in World War II.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir used the anniversary to
speak out against arms sales to the Jewish state's Arab enemies. He
told Israel's Parliament that a united Germany should ``learn the
lessons of the past'' and not sell weapons to Arab nations.
   At a news conference Monday in the heavily guarded West Berlin
Jewish Community headquarters, World Jewish Congress leaders warned
about present dangers and emphasized the need to recall past
tragedies.
   ``The Jewish people have something to say to the new Germany
that is going to be created in a short time,'' said Congress
President Edgar M. Bronfman.
   He opened the meeting Sunday by saying a united Germany must
``forever teach'' about the Holocaust, ``the lowest point ever
reached in man's inhumanity to man.''
   Congress leaders said that in Eastern Europe there were
indications of growing anti-Semitism, fueled in large part by
economic hardship.
   Decades of Communist mismanagement have driven the economies of
East European countries to the brink. Many jobless youths have
turned to right-wing extremism, often blaming Jews and foreigners
for economic ills.
   ``Unfortunately, as the economic situation worsens ... and the
search for scapegoats goes on, the age-old scapegoat _ the Jew _
again takes his place in the forefront of those to be kicked
around,'' Bronfman said.
   ``When you see tens of thousands of Jews leaving the Soviet
Union and going to Israel, one of the main reasons they're going is
because of the rise of anti-Semitism,'' he said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Jews are expected to emigrate to Israel
over the next years, in part because of looser Soviet emigration
policy but also in response to what they say is increasing
religious persecution at home. There are up to 2 million Soviet
Jews.
   Bronfman said that when he visited Poland a few months ago,
government leaders and Solidarity chief Lech Walesa issued ``strong
statements'' against anti-Semitism.
   ``The only way to fight it is to expose it,'' Bronfman said of
anti-Jewish feeling.
   Lionel Kopelowitz, head of the European Jewish Congress, said
there were indications of growing anti-Jewish feeling in Romania.
   ``The people are hungry. They look for a scapegoat,'' he said of
Romania, home to about 25,000 Jews.
   Heinz Galinksi, leader of West Germany's 35,000-member Jewish
community, said he also sees increased neo-Nazi activities and
anti-Semitism in East Germany.
   Neo-Nazis and other rightists recently went on a rampage in East
Berlin, shouting insults against Jews and foreigners.
   Galinski, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, said the
Congress meeting in Berlin was ``perhaps one of the most important
events'' since the downfall of Nazi Germany.
   The World Jewish Congress executive director, Elan Steinberg,
said 10 percent of delegates from outside East and West Germany
declined to participate. About 80 of the 600 delegates were from
countries other than East and West Germany.
   ``There are people who will not come to Berlin, and they have a
right not to come to Berlin,'' Bronfman said. ``We're dealing with
huge, huge emotions here.''
   Neal M. Sher, head of the U.S. Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, said in a speech to delegates that ``Kurt
Waldheim had engaged in Nazi-sponsored persecution.''
   The U.S. government in April 1987 put Waldheim, an officer in
the German army during World War II, on a ``watch list'' of people
denied entry into the country. The ban followed allegations
Waldheim was involved in Nazi atrocities during the war. Waldheim
has denied wrongdoing.
   ``It is also well-known that Waldheim has tried hard and often
to be a removed from the list,'' Sher said. ``But all such
approaches to our government have been rebuffed. He will remain
persona non grata.''

   Barbara Bush told nurses Monday she is their
``greatest fan'' and might have become a nurse herself if she
hadn't married George Bush.
   Mrs. Bush hosted a luncheon in honor of National Nursing Day
before leaving for Costa Rica as head of the U.S. delegation to
Tuesday's inauguration of President-elect Rafael Calderon.
   The 130 guests included nursing association leaders and several
nurses whose husbands serve in Congress.
   Mrs. Bush recalled that as a congressman's wife in the 1960s,
she was surprised to receive an invitation to a luncheon being
given by Lady Bird Johnson to honor achievers in the medical field.
   When she asked why she had been invited, an aide to Mrs. Johnson
said the then-Department of Health, Education and Welfare had a
computerized list of congressional spouses who were nurses ``and
your name ... just popped out.''
   ``I was very grateful for a faulty computer,'' Mrs. Bush
recalled to laughter.
   ``It takes a special kind of person to be a nurse,'' she said.
``You are there on the line every day, 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year. I am your greatest fan.''
   ``I always thought that if I hadn't married George Bush ... the
second best thing would have been to be a nurse,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   The first lady was a hospital volunteer for ``many years,''
including two mornings a week at Sloan Kettering Memorial Hospital
in New York while Bush was the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations from 1971 to 1973.
   She volunteered to repay ``a not-so-little debt I still feel we
owe them,'' she told the luncheon. The Bushes had taken their young
daughter, Robin, to Sloan Kettering for months of treatment before
her death from leukemia in 1953.
   ``I stand in awe of nurses who assure their patients, encourage
them through treatments that are necessary and sometimes painful
and many times frightening, calm the fears and then come back the
next day for another eight-hour shift,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   ``Of all the groups, yours is the most welcome'' in the White
House, she said.
   The guests included nurse Marcelle Leahy, whose husband is Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Several Cabinet wives also attended the
luncheon.

<HEAD>Senior General Reprimanded for Criticizing Handling of Uprising</HEAD>

   A top general stirred an uproar in the Israeli
army Monday by suggesting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir should fire
senior commanders for failing to crush the 29-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   The armed forces chief of staff reprimanded the officer, Maj.
Gen. Moshe Bar-Kochba, for going public with his criticism in
Israeli newspapers, a military official said.
   It was one of the few disclosures of high-level army infighting
over tactics since the uprising against Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.
   Bar-Kochba, 60, adviser to the general staff on strategic
planning, is a former head of the southern command and won a
citation for his role in tank battles during the 1967 Middle East
war.
   In pre-state days, Bar-Kochba fought the British as a member of
the underground Irgun Zvi Leumi guerrilla force headed by Menachem
Begin. Begin later became prime minister.
   His criticism appeared Sunday and Monday on the front pages of
the Davar, Maariv and Hadashot dailies.
   According to Davar, Bar-Kochba said he went public after the
army rejected his recommendations two months ago to use tanks and
more live ammunition to quell riots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Commanders had said it would be immoral to use armored vehicles
against civilians and that it contradicted the army's code of
behavior, Maariv said.
   Eight soldiers have died in the uprising and 683 Palestinians
have been killed in confrontations with Israelis.
   The daily Hadashot said Bar-Kochba sought a meeting with Shamir
to recommend that certain commanders be forced ``to take the
necessary conclusions,'' or resign, for their failure to put down
the uprising.
   No names were given.
   The military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, summoned
Bar-Kochba late Sunday and reprimanded him for publishing his
allegations, an army official said on condition of anonymity.
   The official said Shomron told Bar-Kochba his behavior ``was not
becoming a soldier with his rank and standing.''
   The chief of staff also said Bar-Kochba could freely express his
views inside the army, ``but they (officers) were not free to do
so, either directly or indirectly, through the media.''
   Regulations bar active soldiers from giving interviews without
consent from the military spokesman's office.
   Shomron, 52, is a veteran paratrooper who commanded Israel's
rescue of 102 hostages from a hijacked plane at Entebbe Airport in
1976.
   Believed politically closer to the center-left Labor Party than
Shamir's right-wing Likud, Shomron was appointed chief of staff in
February 1987 and has been attacked by right-wing politicians for
failing to take tough measures.
   Left-wing Parliament member Yossi Sarid accused Bar-Kochba of
using his military service ``to represent the Likud or the even
more right wing,'' in Israel, the pro-Labor Davar reported.
   Rafael Eitan, a former chief of staff and right-wing legislator,
said the feud was the apparent beginning of a fight over who would
succeed Shomron.

   A motorist was shot to death early Monday,
reportedly by someone in a passing car, and authorities shut down a
jampacked freeway for nearly an hour to search for clues.
   The victim was shot in the head while driving south on the
Harbor Freeway about five miles south of downtown, said police Lt.
Bruce Hagerty.
   The victim's car drifted onto the right shoulder before coming
to a stop, police said.
   Police said two motorists reporting from car phones told them
the shots came from a yellow Pontiac Trans-Am occupied by two men.
   All south-bound lanes between Manchester Boulevard and the
Imperial Freeway were closed for an hour during the rush hour,
backing up traffic for miles, said California Highway Patrol
Officer Dwight McDonald.
   No arrests were made and police would not speculate on the
motive for the shooting.

<TEXT>
   Two Norwegian skiers have reached the North
Pole, becoming the first people to make the icy trek without dogs,
motorized vehicles or outside supplies, their colleagues reported
Monday.
   Erling Kagge, 28, and Boerge Ousland, 27, pulled their
provisions on sleds, weighing up to 264 pounds, across 496 miles of
Arctic ice after setting out from Canada's Ward Hunt Island north
of Greenland on March 8.
   ``We received a satellite transmission Sunday saying they made
it,'' said Trond Skaare of the team's communication center. The
pair arrived at the North Pole late Friday or early Saturday,
Skaare said.
   At least 12 previous expeditions failed to reach the earth's
northernmost point without animals, snow vehicles or supplies
delivered en route. None got further than 105 miles, the Norwegian
news agency NTB said.
   Ousland, a deep-sea diver, and Kagge, a law student, trekked for
58 days to beat British, South Korean and Soviet teams also racing
for the pole, Skaare said in a telephone interview.
   ``They must have gone fantastically fast,'' said Ousland's
father, Odd, when he heard the news.
   ``It was a tremendous relief. There had been no radio contact
since April 24,'' Ousland said. ``They could have run into polar
bears or other problems, for all we knew.''
   Britons Sir Ranulph Fiennes, 45, and Mike Stroud, 35, started
from Siberia in early March. They were leading the race to reach
the pole unaided when forced to turn back last week. It was
Fiennes' fourth unsuccessful attempt, according to newspaper
reports. The South Koreans had 188 miles to go, despite airlifted
supplies, reports said.
   Kagge and Ousland crossed crevasses, rough ice and skirted
patches of open water. They suffered minor frostbite in
temperatures that plummeted to minus 67 but were reported in good
condition.
   Numerous expeditions have reached the North Pole since it was
conquered by American Robert Peary in 1909, but all had outside
help.
   The $107,000 Norwegian expedition was funded mostly by the sale
of 50 artworks created and donated by Norwegian painter Jakob
Weidemann.
   An airplane was to pick up Ousland and Kagge as soon as
possible, probably Monday.
   Geir Ramby, a third member of the Norwegian team who was injured
and flown out 10 days after the trek began, said his teammates
probably will celebrate with a hot shower when they reach Resolute
Bay as early as Tuesday.
   ``After using and sweating in the same clothes for two months,
they're probably emitting a pretty powerful stink,'' he told the
newspaper Verdens Gang.

<HEAD>IMF Nearing Agreement on Boosting Loan Resource Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund, struggling to
meet increased financial needs in Eastern Europe and Latin America,
worked Monday to resolve disagreements that have blocked a 50
percent boost in the agency's loan resources.
   Delegates to the spring meeting of the 152-nation agency
expressed optimism that the IMF's policy-setting interim committee
will reach an agreement by Tuesday, ending two years of debate on
the issue.
   The increase would boost IMF resources from $120 billion to $180
billion, making $60 billion more available to support economic
reforms in Poland and other emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The additional funds would also be used to support Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady's strategy of reducing the financial
burden on debt-strapped Latin American countries.
   The increase would require a $12 billion contribution from the
United States. The increase is certain to draw opposition in
Congress from critics of American foreign aid efforts.
   The increase received a big boost Sunday with the approval of
the world's seven largest economies. The United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, known as the Group of
Seven, endorsed the 50 percent increase, making final approval by
the IMF highly likely.
   The Bush administration, however, has tied its support for any
increase to a change in the IMF charter that would allow the fund
to suspend the voting rights of any country behind in its loan
payments. At present, 11 countries _ Sudan, Zambia, Peru, Honduras,
Guyana, Cambodia, Vietnam, Liberia, Panama, Sierra Leone and
Somalia _ owe a total of $4.2 billion in back payments.
   ``These arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the IMF's
financial integrity and its central role in the world economy,''
Brady said in a speech to the 22-member committee as it debated the
issue.
   Delegates from debtor nations on the committee objected to the
United States' get-tough approach. A coordinating group for Third
World countries said in a statement that suspending voting rights
would not ``serve a useful purpose and is not acceptable.''
   The loan resource increase was also tied up in the ticklish
issue of how to rearrange the rankings and voting powers of rich
nations.
   Under the plan expected to win final approval, the United States
would remain the No. 1 shareholder in the IMF with little more than
19 percent of its voting power. Japan would move from No. 5 to No.
2, a spot it would share with West Germany. Each country would hold
a 6 percent voting share.
   Britain would drop from No. 2 to a tie for No. 4 with France,
with each country holding a 5.5 percent voting share.
   John Major, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, told
reporters he believed the question of rankings was almost resolved.
   A third issue under debate was the length of time the higher
loan resource level would be in effect. The United States is
pushing for a five-year period before the IMF again takes up the
issue. Other countries lobbied for a readjustment after three years.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and French Economics
Minister Pierre Beregovoy suggested a compromise might be to settle
on a four-year period.
   None of these issues was expected to delay the final resolution
of the financing increase. The IMF and its sister agency, the World
Bank, are the largest sources for loans to developing countries.
   ``The fund remains pivotal to the international debt strategy
and it will be at the center of international efforts to help
Eastern European countries restructure their economies toward free
markets,'' Brady said Monday. His remarks, made during the private
negotiations, were made available to reporters later.
   In addition to IMF resources, the finance ministers addressed
the progress so far on Brady's one-year-old initiative to reduce
the huge $1.3 trillion Third World debt burden and the economic
impact likely to result from the unification of East and West
Germany.
   Officials generally gave high marks to the Brady plan, which
employs the resources of the IMF and World Bank to provide
incentives to commercial banks to cut old bank debt and interest
payments owed by Third World nations.
   The ministers expressed optimism that German unification will
not produce the adverse effects feared by some economists of
driving up world interest rates and worsening inflationary
pressures.

<HEAD>Voters Reject Tax to Pay for Education of `Baby Boom' Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORTHINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 34-child baby boomlet is
overwhelming this town's five-room school, but residents rejected a
property tax hike to solve the problem.
   Despite heavy lobbying by parents, residents on Saturday voted
down, 263-122, a proposal to override a limit on property tax
increases. Officials said the override was needed because schooling
costs have risen 25 percent.
   In Massachusetts, property tax increases of more than 2{ percent
must be approved by voters.
   The baby boom began eight years ago, when 29 women in this
Berkshire Hills community of 250 families gave birth _ two to twins
_ and three more adopted children. The youngsters are all now in
first and second grade driving up costs at the five-room school.
   Worthington's school costs are up $130,000 over last year. They
account for about one-third of the town's $1.7 million annual
budget.
   For a homeowner with property assessed at $100,000, the override
would have added $125 to the $896 annual tax bill.
   Worthington's school funds come from the seven-town Gateway
Regional School District. Town officials said after the vote they
would wait to see how the other towns in the school district vote
before taking further action.
   ``We haven't really decided what will happen now,'' Selectwoman
Julia Sharron said Monday. ``Possibly if the other towns in the
district vote it down the school will have to go back and make
cuts.''
   Mrs. Sharron said she suspected the override failed because
``people just can't afford to have any higher taxes than they had.''

   Leo Vigil is caught in a New York City nightmare.
   Three weeks ago, his brand-new Nissan Pathfinder was stolen from
outside a Manhattan restaurant where he had taken a customer of his
tie company for dinner.
   ``The buyer was telling me about how his car had been stolen. We
walk out of the restaurant and my car's gone,'' Vigil said.
   On Monday, his other car, a 1989 Jaguar, was one of seven autos
taken at gunpoint from a Greenwich Village garage.
   ``My insurance company is totally freaking out,'' Vigil said.
His two cars were worth about $75,000.
   Two of the cars taken Monday _ a Toyota and a Honda _ were
abandoned near the garage, but the Jaguar, a BMW, a Porsche and two
other cars not yet identified were driven away.
   ``The luxury cars are very hard to steal, that's why we're
having more gunpoint robberies,'' said Sgt. Pete Baglio of the Auto
Crime Division. ``The expensive cars have alarm systems that make
them tough to get into.''
   Once stolen, ``a lot of these cars are being tagged and shipped
out of the country. They're not chopping up these cars,'' Baglio
added.
   ``It's just devastating, it really is,'' Vigil said in a
telephone interview Monday. ``It's just amazing what happens here.''
   He said he'd bought another Pathfinder and would ``hope for the
best.''
   There were 133,861 reported car thefts in the city in 1989, a

   Israeli-backed militiamen killed a pro-Syrian
guerrilla and captured another Monday in a clash in south Lebanon,
the army command said.
   One pro-Israeli militiaman was slightly wounded when guerrillas
fired rifles and a rocket-propelled grenade at a militia patrol
near Beit Yahoun, six miles north of the Israeli border, the army
said.
   Fighters of the South Lebanon Army, which is supplied and
trained by Israel, returned fire, killing one guerrilla and
capturing another, the military said.
   Security sources in Lebanon said other guerrillas reportedly
fled.
   The army said the guerrillas apparently belonged to the Syrian
Socialist Nationalist Party. It is a pro-Syrian militia responsible
for a number of suicide attacks and car bombings in southern
Lebanon.
   They carried Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles, hand
grenades, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, ammunition and other
equipment, the army said.
   Lebanese and Palestinian guerrillas stage frequent attacks on
Israel's security zone, which is intended to prevent cross-border
raids on Israel. The zone is a stretch of land up to 10 miles wide
that Israel established after withdrawing the bulk of its troops
from Lebanon in 1985.
   It is jointly patrolled by Israeli troops and the South Lebanon
Army.

   Convoys of Khmer Rouge trucks
filled with the recent rice harvest move freely through this rural
village in northwest Cambodia, and young guerrilla fighters flirt
with relaxed villagers.
   ``We are very happy to be back in our country,'' said Khmer
Rouge division commander Mit Soe over coconut juice as Cambodian
government artillery rumbled in the distance.
   In a scene played out in scores of villages in rural Cambodia in
recent months, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge have returned to areas they
were driven out of when Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late
1978 and installed a pro-Hanoi government.
   To much of the world, the Khmer Rouge are fanatics who killed
hundreds of thousands of their countrymen during the 1970s in a
savage bid to create a communist agrarian society.
   But despite the widely held perception that they continue to be
universally despised, the Khmer Rouge maintain significant and
increasing support in the long-neglected, poor villages of this
ravaged country.
   Since the announced pullout of Vietnamese troops in September,
the Khmer Rouge have seized hundreds of villages in the north, west
and southwest of the country.
   Khmer Rouge officials in Cambodia and western intelligence
sources in Bangkok, Thailand say the group is attracting followers
by tapping the deep suspicion most Cambodians harbor for their
historical enemy, Vietnam.
   The Khmer Rouge contend that Vietnam intends to ``swallow''
Cambodia. They allege that despite the pledged Vietnamese
withdrawal, Vietnamese troops secretly remain in Cambodia disguised
as Cambodian soldiers.
   Although human rights groups have described strict regimentation
and brutality in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas over the past decade,
the guerrillas seem to have abandoned their harshest practices _ at
least temporarily.
   Analysts are quick to point out that most Cambodians still
loathe the Khmer Rouge and note that Pol Pot, Khieu Samphan and
other leaders who presided over the 1975-78 reign of terror are
still in charge. There is fear that if the Khmer Rouge were to
return to power, their murderous ways would simply resurface.
   But the analysts say the Khmer Rouge have managed to maintain a
support network throughout rural Cambodia and have been able to
recruit fighters since being driven to sanctuaries along the
Thai-Cambodian border after the Vietnamese invasion.
   ``If they were that evil, they wouldn't have survived the last
11{ years. There must be something they are fighting for that makes
the Khmer people join them,'' Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
told the British newspaper The Independent in a recent interview.
   Although he frequently condemns the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia's
exiled leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, recently said they have
adopted a ``new style'' that includes scrupulously honest and
disciplined behavior when dealing with villagers.
   Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia until he was ousted in a 1970
military coup, predicted the Khmer Rouge would win ``many seats''
in parliament should general elections be held in Cambodia.
   ``You won't get people to vote for Pol Pot himself for
president,'' said one Western intelligence analyst in Bangkok,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But as an organization, they
have clear popular support based on their honesty, dedication and
nationalism.''
   By contrast, the pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh and the two
non-communist guerrilla groups which are loosely allied with the
Khmer Rouge are rife with the decades-long scourge of Cambodian
politics _ corruption.
   In recent months, soldiers of the two non-communist groups have
also displayed a gross lack of discipline that has shocked even
their own commanders. Rape and robbery of villagers occur
frequently.
   ``When the Khmer Rouge come to town, you don't have to hide your
daughter and your money,'' said a Bangkok-based diplomat,
requesting anonymity.
   In the U.N. refugee camps that house 300,000
guerrilla-controlled civilians along the Thai border, relief
officials say the Khmer Rouge camps are the best-run.
   ``We have the least problems in the Khmer Rouge camps,'' said a
senior U.N. official in the border town of Aranyaprathet. ``A lot
less corruption. Their leaders are hardworking and dedicated.
Nobody wants to hear it, but it happens to be true.'' He spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   Western and Thai intelligence sources say that as many as 80
percent of the Khmer Rouge ranks are new recruits who have joined
since the Vietnamese invasion. Troop strength is generally
estimated at between 25,000 and 35,000, more than twice the size of
the decimated forces which fled to the Thai border in 1979.
   Dozens of Khmer Rouge fighters interviewed in recent weeks in
newly seized villages in northwest Cambodia say they considered
themselves nationalists and openly rejected communism.
   ``The average Khmer Rouge soldier thinks he is liberating his
country from the Vietnamese, not fighting for an ideology,'' said
one Western diplomat in Bangkok, requesting anonymity.
   The Khmer Rouge, which receives Chinese support, says it will
continue fighting until there is an internationally verified
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and a coalition government,
including the three guerrilla groups and the pro-Hanoi government
of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   The Phnom Penh government has rejected any interim coalition
including the Khmer Rouge, which it accuses of genocide against the
Cambodian people.

<HEAD>12 Killed as Rival Christian Forces Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces blasted each other
with artillery and tank fire in east Beirut and the surrounding
countryside Monday, killing 12 people and wounding 27, police said.
   Several apartment buildings and filling stations in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave were set ablaze. Trucks carrying
food across Beirut's dividing Green Line also were burning, police
and witnesses said.
   ``Everything is burning at the crossing. Drivers abandoned their
trucks and ran back to the Moslem sector. So did hundreds of
Christian residents,'' said Simon Khoury, a Christian electrician
who made it back to west Beirut.
   The fighting marked a sharp escalation in the 3{-month-old
battle between army Gen. Michel Aoun and Christian warlord Samir
Geagea for mastery of the enclave north and northeast of Beirut.
   Police said the fatalities included a family of five killed when
a shell struck the basement of their building in the
Aoun-controlled town of Fanar north of Beirut.
   Also killed was police Capt. Pierre Ghawi. He died when several
artillery rounds strayed from the embattled enclave and landed in
the Moslem sector. Four civilians were wounded in west Beirut,
police said.
   Flames lit up the night sky and the roar of shell blasts
reverberated across Beirut. Tens of thousands of residents huddled
in basements and bomb shelters on both sides of the Green Line.
   Christian employees of Middle East Airlines and the Trans
Mediterranean Airlines, Lebanon's national passenger and cargo
carriers, were trapped at Beirut airport, unable to return home.
   Employees will spend the night at the facility, on the southern
edge of Beirut, an airport statement said.
   Aoun's mountain-top positions poured 155mm howitzer barrages on
east Beirut's seaside Karantina district, which houses the military
command of Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   A Lebanese Forces gunboat off Karantina was seen unleashing
rapid barrages of rockets from multi-barreled launchers on the Metn
mountains and then speeding away with shells falling all around.
   Each side blamed the other for the flare-up, which broke out at
midnight Sunday, tapered off four hours later and escalated again
in the afternoon.
   The fighting between Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's 6,000
militiamen has left 934 people dead and 2,483 wounded, by the
latest police count.
   The conflict, the worst inter-christian confrontation in the
nation's 15-year-old civil war, has forced more than 400,000 of the
enclave's 1 million inhabitants to flee. Material damage has been
estimated at $1 billion.

   An 82-year-old ex-convict charged with
murdering two sheriff's deputies is mentally unfit to stand trial
but will likely remain locked up for the rest of his life, a
prosecutor says.
   ``We can't try him because he can't understand the charges
against him or assist in his defense. If he is ever found competent
to stand trial, we'll start the trial process right away. He won't
be freed,'' said District Attorney General Paul Summers.
   The suspect, Ule Reynolds, is charged with shooting two
Lauderdale County sheriff's deputies in January. The deputies were
giving Reynolds a ride in their cruiser after finding him late at
night in a disabled car.
   Authorities say the deputies, Bobby Nolen, 55, and Kevan Ward,
31, apparently put Reynolds in the back seat of the cruiser without
searching him for weapons.
   Reynolds, who has a criminal record dating from 1927, was armed
with a .357-caliber Magnum revolver in a shoulder holster,
authorities said.
   A resident of Gary, Ind., Reynolds apparently ran his car into a
ditch near Ripley while driving alone to Tennessee to attend the
funeral of a cousin, investigators say.
   Summers said doctors at the Middle Tennessee Mental Health
Institute at Nashville have examined Reynolds and found him to be
senile.
   A Lauderdale County circuit judge accepted that finding Friday
and ruled Reynolds incompetent to stand trial, Summers said.
   Prosecutors have asked for Reynolds to be committed to a mental
institution and the court is expected to review his status next
month, Summers said. He has remained in custody without bond since
his arrest.
   Reynolds' relatives and friends have told authorities that his
mental abilities have deteriorated in recent years. His wife,
Minnie, said he told her after the shooting that he thought the
deputies were taking him to jail.
   Reynolds, a barber, was convicted of manslaughter in Tennessee
in 1927 and served a two- to five-year prison sentence. He had
several arrests on charges involving firearms over the years and
was convicted in 1975 in Indiana on a weapons violations and with
trying to tamper with a jury in a criminal case.

   A retarded man who was released from a mental
hospital despite community opposition was held Monday on burglary
charges.
   Bernt Murphy, confined 31 years after being found incompetent to
be tried in a rape, was charged in a weekend break-in seven blocks
from the group home where he had lived since his release.
   He was charged with theft and attempted burglary and held at
Utah County Jail on $10,000 bail on orders of Circuit Judge John C.
Backlund.
   Murphy, 52, was sent to the Utah State Hospital after being
found incompetent to stand trial in the 1957 rape of a 5-year-old
girl. During police interviews in that case, he confessed to
killing a 23-year-old woman but was never charged in the slaying.
   In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court ordered his release, ruling he
had mistakenly been found insane. He moved into the group home Jan.
22, and has been living with three other retarded men.
   His presence triggered outraged reaction from neighbors who
argued that retarded men with histories of violence shouldn't be
housed in a residential area.
   The owners of the home, which is up for sale, told police Murphy
asked to look at the home Friday evening but was turned away
because it was too late. Owners Eric and Lisa Gardner said they
returned Saturday to find pry marks around a door and a window and
the family dog missing.
   It didn't appear anyone got into the home, said Detective Gerald
Nielsen. But a trophy with Murphy's name on it was found on the
back porch and his sunglasses were found in the dog run.
   Murphy's civil attorney, Lisa Marcy of Salt Lake's Legal Center
for the Handicapped, said she knew Murphy had been talking about
leaving the group home and had told people there that he hoped to
buy a home.
   Neighbor Bobby Jo Jackson, who has protested the decision to
place ``high-risk'' residents in the group home, said she felt
sorry for Murphy.
   ``They've all been set up to fail,'' she said. ``People with the
mentality of a nine-year-old should have structure and
supervision.''

   A pharmaceutical company is recalling 2,800

of bacterial contamination that could cause serious eye infections
and possible blindness.
   Ocumed Inc. said the 4-ounce plastic bottles were stamped on the

manufactured for Rugby Laboratories Inc., Rockville Centre, N.Y.,
11570.
   There have been no reports of injury, the company said.
   However, the company said testing by the Food and Drug
Administration and its own laboratories found bacteria that could
cause infection in a scratched or damaged eye, with the potential
for loss of vision.
   The over-the-counter product is used by people with tired eyes
or eyes subjected to dusty conditions.
   Consumers should return the product to the place of purchase.

   Nelson Mandela's wife, Winnie,
whipped, punched and slapped three men and a teen-ager who had been
abducted and held captive in her home, a witness testified in a
trial Monday.
   The teen-ager, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, was found stabbed to
death on Jan. 6, 1989. One of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, Jerry
Richardson, is on trial for his death.
   Richardson pleaded innocent to the charges of murder,
kidnapping, attempted murder and assault. Eight other bodyguards
for Mrs. Mandela face separate trials on lesser charges stemming
from the incident.
   The three men said they survived beatings by Mrs. Mandela and
her bodyguards in late December 1988. They have given sworn
affidavits saying she participated in the assaults on them and on
Seipei.
   Police are investigating the allegations. Mrs. Mandela has not
been charged with a crime and denies being present during the
attacks.
   Kenneth Kgase, 30, one of the abducted men, was the first
witness to testify in the trial that began Wednesday. On Monday,
Kgase said Mrs. Mandela assaulted all four of the captives,
punching and whipping them and pulling their hair.
   According to Kgase, the attack occurred after Mrs. Mandela was
told that the four had homosexual relations with a Methodist
minister who ran the house where they had been staying in Soweto.
The Methodist Church says it has investigated the accusation and
cleared the minister.
   Mrs. Mandela left the room following the attack, and then her
bodyguards, also known as the Mandela United soccer team, assaulted
the captives, Kgase said. He said the bodyguards lifted the four
above their shoulders and then dropped them to the floor.
   Team members also hit the men on the knees with shoe heels and
empty bottles, he alleged.
   When the beatings ended, Kgase said, the captives were forced to
clean their blood from the floor, using a broom and hose.
   Leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations in South Africa
have accused Mrs. Mandela of complicity in the abductions and
assault of the four. They said her bodyguards, mostly young men in
their teens or early 20s, had waged a ``reign of terror'' in
Soweto, the black township outside Johannesburg.
   The anti-apartheid leaders called for the black community to
shun Mrs. Mandela early last year. But a few months later she began
appearing at rallies with other leaders, and she is now regularly
at her husband's side when he makes public appearances.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, has
made no public comment on the case since being released from prison
in February.
   Mrs. Mandela is not expected to appear at Richardson's trial.
   She denied last year that she was in her house when the youths
were allegedly assaulted.
   In a separate development Monday, the ANC-affiliated Alexandra
Civic Association condemned the re-emergence of kangaroo courts.
   The civic association, some of whose members had supported the
so-called ``people's courts'' during the 1984-86 nationwide
political violence, said it was barbaric that inexperienced youths
have been judging and meting out punishment to older citizens.
   The organization's spokesman, Obed Bapela, said people in the
township were taking their crime problems to young people known as
``comrades'' instead of to the police because residents had lost
confidence in the authorities.
   ``Crime in Alexandra is escalating every day but that (kangaroo
courts) is a crime in itself,'' Bapela said.
   The public condemnation of the ``people's courts'' was made
after front-page newspaper accounts Monday in which a 32-year-old
woman said ``comrades'' sentenced her to 100 lashes with a whip,
stripped her in front of a large crowd and flogged her, because she
had stabbed a man who broke into her home to rape her.

<TEXT>
   A nationwide phone-in game costing $3 to
battle other trivia buffs for a $1 million prize started Monday.
   A congressman, however, has said callers were gambling and he
wants the Justice Department to investigate.
   ``The Game'' uses computer technology to pit up to nine callers
to a 900 area code number against each other in a trivia contest.
Winners avance to subsequent rounds by calling a toll-free 800
number.
   Examples of the questions, which have numerical answers entered
on touchtone telephones, include: ``What year did Columbus sail for
the New World'' and ``How many keys on a piano?''
   Second-round winners get $5, fourth-round winners $100 and sixth
round $10,000. Every two weeks, sixth-round winners will compete
for the $1 million seventh and final round.
   ``We think it's going to be a hit,'' said Lynn Folse, vice
president of Los Angeles-based 900 Million Productions.
   But Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., wants the Justice Department to
intervene.
   ``Participants in this game are effectively betting $2.99 that
they will win money, much as participants in a lottery pay for the
chance to win cash,'' Gordon said Monday.
   He complained in a letter sent Friday to the Justice Department
that ``The Game'' may violate anti-gambling laws. The congressman
also noted there was a potential for children to run up telephone
bills.
   ``There is no way to restrict The Game to adults because there
is no way to verify age levels over the telephone. Kids can quickly
run up huge phone bills without their parents' knowledge,'' Gordon
said.
   ``No one can cash a check unless they are 18 or older so there
would be no point in playing,'' Folse argued. ``This has nothing to
do with gambling. This is a game of common knowledge and skill.
   ``It has nothing whatsoever to do with a game of chance.''

   Leaders of an anti-government protest
in a downtown square expressed uncertainty Monday about whether
they would accept an invitation to meet with interim President Ion
Iliescu.
   Hundreds of demonstrators demanding Iliescu's resignation
occupied the capital's central University Square for the 16th
straight day Monday. The crowd swelled from 500 early in the day to
about 1,500 by evening.
   Iliescu had previously ruled out any dialogue with the
protesters, but on Saturday he agreed to meet with leaders of the
opposition groups coordinating the demonstration.
   Romanian officials said opposition leaders have yet to respond
to an invitation for a meeting Tuesday morning.
   But representatives of the opposition groups said Monday that
they have some hesitation regarding the talks. They expressed
concern the meeting was intended only to calm the situation without
seriously addressing the issues.
   The state radio reported one protest leader, Dumitru Dinca, had
stopped his nine-day hunger strike to prepare for the meeting with
Iliescu.
   As of Sunday, 57 demonstrators were fasting in University Square
to press their demands for Iliescu's resignation.
   The demonstrators are also demanding free elections scheduled
for May 20 be delayed to give newly formed opposition parties more
time to organize, and that the electoral law be amended to exclude
former Communist officials from high public office.
   Iliescu has ruled out any discussion of postponing the elections
or the electoral law, saying both were approved by the provisional
parliament, which includes opposition parties.
   Iliescu, who heads the National Salvation Front that dominates
the interim government, was a high-ranking Communist official under
deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, but fell out of favor and was
relegated to minor posts.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front is considered the favorite in
the upcoming election. A poll released this week showed Iliescu
with support of 79 percent of the voters.
   The protesters say they are seriously concerned because the
National Salvation Front contains many former Communist Party
members who want to introduce a reformed version of Communism.
   The demand for excluding Communists from top government posts is
included in a proclamation drawn up in March in Timisoara by
opposition activists who fear that the interim leadership has sold
out the anti-Communist aims of the revolution that toppled
Ceausescu.
   The December revolt that led to the ouster and execution of
Ceausescu began with the shooting of anti-government protesters in
Timisoara, 250 miles west of the capital.
   In another development Monday, supporters of the Front in the
Moldavian town of Vaslui, about 175 miles north of Bucharest,
published a proclamation attacking what they described as the
provocative rally in University Square.
   The proclamation accused the demonstrators of trying ``to
disturb public peace ... and prevent the normal unfolding of the
electoral process.''
   In an apparent reference to the protesters' demand to exclude
Communists from public office, the proclamation criticized what it
called ``attempts to instill a venomous atmosphere and sow division
among the electorate.''
   The proclamation was also read out Sunday by interim Prime
Minister Petre Roman during a pro-Front campaign rally in Vaslui
that drew 20,000 people.

   The FBI said Monday it was questioning people
involved in a weekend clash in which Vietnamese and Louisiana
shrimp fishermen reportedly exchanged gunfire and rammed each
others' boats.
   ``We have a number of people left to interview on both sides
then we'll talk to the U.S. Attorney'' about a possible grand jury
investigation, said FBI spokesman Volney Hayes.
   Six shrimp boats, some with bullet holes, were taken to Port
Fourchon in Lafourche Parish on Sunday, the Coast Guard said. After
crew members were questioned, the boats were released, a Harbor
Police spokesman said.
   Four Vietnamese immigrants were detained for their own safety
but no one was arrested, the Coast Guard said. They were
interviewed by federal agents Sunday at Grand Isle, then returned
to their boat at Port Fourchon.
   No names were released.
   Donald Lirette of Dulac, president of the Terrebonne Fishermen's
Organization, said the fight was a result of tension between
longtime area fishermen and Vietnamese newcomers.
   He said recent bad winter weather kept boats in port much of the
time and that, coupled with several bad years for shrimpers, have
left tempers short.
   The Vietnamese fishermen would not discuss the incident with
reporters who gathered at the small fishing community of Port
Fourchon.
   Lirette recounted it this way: ``The Vietnamese heard the
Americans say they had found a little spot of shrimp and they went
in there and tried to run the Americans off. American shrimpers
have a problem because they can't communicate with the Vietnamese.
They come in with those big boats and know they can run the
Americans out of the shrimp.''
   No injuries were reported in the Saturday afternoon exchange at
Whiskey Pass, one of Louisiana's barrier islands in the Gulf of
Mexico, about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans.
   The anchor of the vessel Our Mama, manned by local fishermen,
became entangled in the net of the vessel Freedom I, manned by
Vietnamese immigrants, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard got a call from Our Mama saying it was being
fired on by Freedom I. Our Mama returned fire, the Coast Guard
said, and three crewmen from Freedom I jumped overboard. A workboat
picked them up and took them to an oil rig.
   The shooting stopped when Coast Guard helicopters and boats
arrived. The crew of a cutter saw what appeared to be weapons
thrown overboard, Lt. Michael Tekesky said.
   The Coast Guard said nine or 10 boats were in the area at the
time. One began sinking, but righted itself with pumps from the
Coast Guard, Tekesky said.
   Despite the incident, the Coast Guard did not step up patrols
Monday, Petty Officer Bob Morehead said.

   Counselors were sent to six elementary
schools Monday to console grieving classmates of three children who
were killed when a Cadillac plowed through a Little League field
during a baseball game.
   Police sought grand jury subpoenas to determine if charges
should be filed against the driver, who also injured nine people in
Saturday's tragedy.
   Adults shared the shock of their children over the worst
disaster in memory in this close-knit community west of Chicago.
   ``The whole community is very much disturbed. People on the
street hug and cry,'' said the Rev. Leon Wagner, pastor at St.
Mary's Catholic Church, where families of four children involved in
the accident attend services.
   ``I would say the parents are probably the ones who are worst
hit,'' Wagner said. ``Like every other community, time will heal
it.''
   Police asked the Cook County state's attorney to seek subpoenas
for medical records and testimony of the driver, 59-year-old James
J. Harasek, to find out why his car plowed into the 7- and
8-year-old Little League players in a park Saturday afternoon, said
Police Chief Don Doneske.
   Harasek, who was hospitalized in fair condition with a fractured
left elbow, has refused to answer investigators' questions on the
advice of his attorney, Doneske said.
   Harasek's wife, Loretta, said her husband ``blacked out and
doesn't remember hitting nothing till he hit the building, that's
when he knew he hit something.''
   ``I'm very deeply hurt and so upset I can't even begin to say
how bad I feel,'' she said by telephone Sunday.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Harasek was taking heart
medication.
   ``He does have a heart problem, and we wouldn't allow him to
drive, but he decided he wanted to drive today,'' Harasek's
daughter Anastasia told the newspaper. ``His health is usually OK.''
   Efforts to reach the family Monday were not successful. Several
telephone calls to their Westchester home went unanswered.
   Charles G. Levy, Harasek's attorney, declined to comment Monday
about the alleged heart problems. But he did say that tests taken
shortly after the accident showed that Harasek's blood contained
``zero percent alcohol, none at all.''
   The dead children were identified as Colin Anderson, 7; Holly
Rizzi, 8; and Ryan Womanck, 8.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday for
two of the victims.
   Arrangements were incomplete for Colin Anderson, whose father,
Bruce, remained hospitalized Monday in fair condition with a leg
injury at Loyola University Medical Center.
   Two children remained in critical condition at Loyola, and one
was in fair condition, said hospital spokesman Michael Maggio.
   Officials said a Little League game had just begun when
Harasek's car veered off the road and plowed into a row of children
seated on a bench behind a fence along the third-base line.
   The car traveled 573 feet across the park, crossed a four-lane
road and stopped when it crashed into a medical clinic. No one in
the clinic was injured.

<HEAD>BLM, AuCoin Say Owl Conservation Could Trigger Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to save the northern spotted owl from
extinction could devastate timber-based small towns in the Pacific
Northwest, Bureau of Land Management Director Cy Jamison told a
congressional panel Monday.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., also said economic fallout from the
conservation plans and reduced timber harvests ``could literally
throw the entire region into a recession.''
   Jamison said the expected impact of setting aside millions of
acres to protect the rare owl demonstrates weaknesses in the
Endangered Species Act.
   ``If the Act stays the same, somehow we have to look at the
management in a different light,'' he said in testimony before the
Hosue Appropriatiosn interior subcommittee, on which AuCoin sits.
   ``If you manage a little area for the spotted owl here, and an
area for the desert tortoise over here, and an area for something
else here, you end up with a hodge-podge on a map. Pretty soon you
have no management system out there at all.''
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is to decide June 23 whether to
list the spotted owl as a threatened or endangered species, which
would require government agencies to protect its habitat _ the
old-growth forests of the Northwest.
   A panel of government scientists led by Forest Service biologist
Jack Ward Thomas alredy has recommended an end to logging across
large sections of federal lands in the Northwest to keep the owl
alive.
   Last week, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management
said that if the Thomas recommendation is adopted timber harvests
on Northwest federal lands will be cut nearly in half over the next
five years, causing a net loss of about 13,000 jobs in Oregon,
Washington and northern California.
   Jamison said his agency has identified 72 communities in Oregon
with populations of 3,000 or fewer. Of those, half or more are
almost entirely dependent on the timber industry, he said.
   ``We would basically affect one whole strata of the communities
in your state (Oregon). If that isn't drastic, I don't know what it
is,'' he said. ``For those communities affected, it could be
devastating.''
   ``We are really talking aobut enormous, staggering economic
consequences.''
   AuCoin said, ``There is nothing that has come close to this in
the entire history of the Endangered Species Act.''

   A pharmaceutical company is recalling 2,800

of bacterial contamination that could cause serious eye infections
and possible blindness.
   Ocumed Inc. said the 4-ounce plastic bottles were stamped on the
bottom with lot number N4189. The product label says it is
manufactured for Rugby Laboratories Inc., Rockville Centre, N.Y.,
11570.
   There have been no reports of injury, the company said.
   However, the company said testing by the Food and Drug
Administration and its own laboratories found bacteria that could
cause infection in a scratched or damaged eye, with the potential
for loss of vision.
   The over-the-counter product is used by people with tired eyes
or eyes subjected to dusty conditions.
   Consumers should return the product to the place of purchase.

   A homeless woman gave birth in the restroom of a
city park on Monday just before she was discovered by a park worker.
   The unidentified mother and baby girl were in satisfactory
condition at New York Infirmary-Beekman Downtown Hospital, said
Maureen Flatley, a hospital spokeswoman.
   ``I'm still shook up,'' said Idell Moore, the attendant at
Battery Park who discovered the birth.
   Moore, 59, a city park worker for nearly 10 years, said she
entered the restroom to clean it when she realized a woman was in a
stall and a baby was on the floor.
   ``I said, `Oh, my God,''' Moore recalled. ``The mother was
inside the stall. You could see the baby from underneath.''
   She then ran out for a supervisor and they called 911. When they
returned, the woman ``was washing herself off. She didn't do
anything with the baby. The baby was lying there on the floor.''
   Moore and the supervisor, Ida Pedalino, took off their shirts to
wrap the baby and police officers helped gather cardboard and
newspaper to hold the infant.
   Moore said the woman had been living on benches in the park for
about two years.

   The number of refugees has increased
dramatically over the last five years, but a State Department
official said Monday that many may be able to go home in the 1990s.
   However, Princeton Lyman, director of refugee programs, said it
will take a lot of money to resettle displaced people around the
globe.
   Lyman told a Senate committee that the department wants $475
million in fiscal 1991 to help refugees.
   Of the total, $215.5 million is for international programs, an
increase of $46.5 million over 1990.
   Although the number of refugees has swelled to 15 million, Lyman
said there are ``brighter prospects of long-awaited opportunities
to resolve the situations'' of many of them in the 1990s.
   He said the United States hoped to see refugees return to their
homes in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and several countries in Africa.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized the Bush administration
for failing to pay enough attention to refugees.
   ``The world is changing,'' he said, adding that the
administration continues to spend too much on military aid.

<HEAD>Tab For 1990 Congressional Campaigns At $127 Million And Rising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Candidates for this year's congressional
elections spent $127 million in the 15 months ending March 31 and
had nearly $140 million on hand to begin the final months of the
campaign season, the Federal Election Commission said Monday.
   The agency's analysis of 1990 congressional campaign
fund-raising and spending from January 1989 through March showed
the benefits of incumbency, particularly in receiving donations
from political action committees.
   Incumbents had a more than 6-to-1 overall fund-raising edge over
challengers and a 16-to-1 edge when it came to PAC donations,
according to the FEC data.
   Overall, the FEC computer analysis showed receipts by 1990
congressional campaigns totaled $192.5 million from Jan. 1, 1989,
through the end of March, 7 percent more than was raised in the
comparable period in the 1987-88 election cycle.
   Of those receipts, $150 million went to incumbents. And
incumbents accounted for the $94.6 million of the reported $127
million in spending.
   The $127 million spent by 1,269 candidates for House and Senate
seats up this year represents a 12 percent increase over the
1987-88 cycle. At this point two years ago, 1,344 candidates had
spent $113 million.
   The analysis was based on the quarterly finance reports all
campaigns were required to file last month. The reports detail
campaign activity through March 31 and include all candidates who
raised and spent money on 1990 congressional races even if they
since have dropped out.
   For many candidates, the campaign season _ and its accompanying
fund-raising _ is just kicking into high gear. But the FEC's
computer analysis showed the campaigns had a combined $138.5
million on hand at the end of March.
   The clear leader in cash on hand was Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who reported having $6.5 million as of March 31. The House
candidate with the most on hand was California Democratic Rep. Mel
Levine, with $1.5 million. Seventy candidates, most of them
longshots in House races, reported zero balances.
   The biggest spender so far on a 1990 Senate race was New Jersey
Democrat Bill Bradley, who reported spending $3.6 million so far on
his re-election effort. Leading spending for 1990 House races was
California Republican Rep. Robert Dornan, who reported spending
$968,525 as of March 31.
   Other highlights:
   _The 1,151 candidates in 1990 House elections raised $109.2
million and spent $79.7 million in the January 1989-March 1990
period. Those candidates raised $52.4 million in individual
contributions and $41.9 million from PACs.
   _The 118 Senate candidates raised $83 million and spent $47
million in the 15-month period, with $56.2 million of the receipts
coming from individuals and $19.6 million from PACs.
   _The 444 incumbents seeking re-election reported total campaign
receipts of $150 million in the 15-month period, dwarfing the $23.4
million raised by 600 challengers. Another $19 million was raised
by the 225 candidates in races in which there is no incumbent.
   _Of $61 million in PAC donations to 1990 candidates during the
15 months, $54.5 million went to incumbents, $3.3 million to
challengers and $3.5 million to candidates for open seats. The
latter group includes House members seeking open Senate seats.

<HEAD>`Saturday Night' Cast Member Won't Appear on Show with Andrew Dice
Clay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran cast member of ``Saturday Night
Live'' said Monday she would refuse to perform on this weekend's
show because the program's host is the foul-mouthed comedian Andrew
Dice Clay.
   Nora Dunn, who has been on the show since the 1985-86 season,
said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that she
found Clay's comedy act so degrading and repulsive that she refused
to help promote his career through ``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``In my heart, I know I don't want to work with him,'' Miss Dunn
said from New York.
   She said Clay's comedy act, laced with expletives and frank
descriptions sex and submissive women, is ``hateful.''
   Clay's management company in Los Angeles didn't immediately
return a call seeking comment.
   Miss Dunn said she didn't know if any other cast members would
join her boycott of the NBC comedy show.
   ``I love `Saturday Night Live' and I feel loyal to my
colleagues, my cast members and the writers of the show, and I
respect them very much,'' Miss Dunn said. ``But I will not perform
with Andrew Dice Clay and I don't want to be associated with him
and I oppose his work.
   ``I don't want to be part of providing an arena for him to make
himself legitimate because I don't think he is. Although I feel he
has a right to express himself, I have a right to strongly state my
position.''
   Lorne Michaels, the producer of the 15-year-old ``Saturday Night
Live,'' said, ``We're proud of Nora Dunn's statement and her stand
on this. But the show will go on.''
   Asked if Miss Dunn would be fired for her mutiny, the show's
spokeswoman, Rosemary Keenan, said, ``absolutely not.''
   Miss Dunn, 37, appeared in the films ``Working Girl'' and
``Miami Blues.'' Her characters on ``Saturday Night Live'' include
talk show hostess Pat Stevens; Babette, the international
sex-kitten model; Liz Sweeney of the Sweeney Sisters nightclub act,
and Linda Dano, a talk show host.
   Just because Clay is popular doesn't mean his comedy is
palatable, said Miss Dunn, adding: ``If I was booking the show in
the '30s I wouldn't book Adolf Hitler simply because he's
chancellor and has a big following.''

<HEAD>Latvia Promises Gorbachev it Will Respect Soviet Interests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Latvia promised Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev on Monday that the Baltic republic will respect Soviet
interests despite its declaration of independence, and expressed
the hope that talks would open soon.
   Hours before, Gorbachev had asked for complete information about
Latvia's independence declaration last Friday.
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov immediately assigned several
members of Parliament to prepare a reply.
   Also Monday, Latvia's Parliament also elected a new prime
minister, Ivars Godmanis, a physics professor and leader of the
Popular Front.
   Chairman Dainis Ivans of the Latvian Popular Front, which has
led the push for independence, called Gorbachev's request
``wonderful.''
   He told reporters, ``This gives us a chance to present our point
of view.'' The letter from Parliament explained certain points in
the declaration, then concluded, ``We express the certainty that
the character of the declaration, the retention of current
constitutional norms and sincere desire to respect the interests of
the U.S.S.R. will meet with your understanding and open the way to
a fruitful dialogue in the spirit of honest cooperation between
equals.''
   On Monday, Gorbachev condemned ``separatists'' in a speech to a
group of veterans. But the Tass report did not say he mentioned
Latvia directly.
   ``There are forces that would like to use the atmosphere of
democracy, glasnost and freedom to implement their futile ambitious
plans, including separatist plans,'' he said, adding that their
policy was ``irresponsible.''
   Latvia plans to send a delegation to Moscow this week, Ivans
said, and he thinks the delegation will be received.
   A similar effort by Lithuania, which declared independence March
11, proved fruitless.
   The Soviet president imposed an oil and natural gas embargo on
Lithuania, idling 12,500 workers. He refuses to negotiate with
Lithuania until the republic of 3.8 million people rescinds several
laws passed after independence was declared.
   Lithuania also must return to the Soviet Union's constitutional
framework, Gorbachev says.
   The three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were
forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1940. Soon after
Gorbachev began his reforms, all three initiated independence
drives. He offered them more say in economic and political
decisions, but said secession would have to be by Soviet law.
   Of Latvia's 2.6 million residents, just over half are ethnic
Latvians and a third are ethnic Russians. Many of the non-Latvians,
especially Russians, oppose secession.
   Latvia, unlike Lithuania, did not suspend its Soviet
constitution upon declaring independence. It just added sections
calling for independence and democracy.
   Estonia last month declared it intends to restore its
independence, and called the Soviet Union an occupying power. But
it set no date for the split and left the door open for
negotiations. Gorbachev threatened Estonia, but took no action
against it.
   Lithuanian lawmaker Nikolai Medvedev, visiting Riga, said it
appeared that, although the three Baltic republics have taken
different approaches to their independence drives, ``The answer is
the same.''
   Gorbunov and other Latvian leaders have emphasized that Latvia's
declaration, with its unspecified transition period to full
independence, is calculated to ``leave the door open'' to talks
with the Kremlin.
   On Saturday night, Latvian Communist Party chief Alfreds Rubiks
said he had spoken with Gorbachev, that Gorbachev ruled out talks
and was considering sanctions instead.
   But Latvian politicians and Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov said Monday that Rubiks' account did not
constitute an official reaction.
   Godmanis, the new prime minister, told Parliament his economic
plan included denationalization of some industries, rationing of
some basic foodstuffs and free market prices on most other products.
   He said the government would work to strengthen economic
cooperation among the three Baltic republics and foster direct ties
between Latvia and various Soviet regions.
   Thousands of Soviet soldiers continued to rehearse for the May 9
parade in Riga celebrating victory in Europe in World War II. But
Ivans said Latvians were refusing to consider it intimidation, such
as the repeated tank movements used in Lithuania to unnerve
independence activists there.
   ``It might mean a demonstration of force,'' Ivans admitted.
``But we are trying to approach it very tolerantly.''
   About 50 Soviet soldiers approached the Latvian Parliament
building when Monday's session opened. They unfurled a red banner
reading, ``Comrades. Have No Doubt We Will Defend the Interests of
the U.S.S.R. with Honor.'' Thousands of Soviet troops are stationed
in Latvia.
   Latvians, incensed by the slogan's ominous tone, shouted,
``Shame!'' in Russian at the soldiers. The argument remained
peaceful.

<TEXT>
   Jurors were urged Monday to return a murder
verdict against a white man accused of shooting a black teen-ager
who ventured into a mostly-white neighborhood and encountered an
angry mob.
   The attack blamed on defendant Joseph Fama stirred racial
tension in the Brooklyn neighborhood where the slaying occurred and
throughout the city.
   The victim, Yusuf Hawkins, 16, went to the Bensonhurst
neighborhood Aug. 23 with two friends looking for a used car and
was beset by a group of bat-wielding white youths. Hawkins was shot
through the chest.
   ``When the mob turned that corner what did they know about Yusuf
Hawkins?'' asked the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Edward
Boyar. ``They knew the color of his skin. That was the only thing
they knew about Yusuf Hawkins.''
   Pointing across the courtroom at the 19-year-old defendant
during his closing argument, the prosecutor said, ``The evidence
clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt proves Joseph Fama was the
one who took a gun ... and pointed it at the body of Yusuf Hawkins
and with a wanton disregard for human life shot again and again and
again.''
   Defense lawyer David DePetris, in his closing presentation,
attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses, including two
jailhouse informants who testified Fama told them he killed Hawkins.
   The state court jury began deliberating after receiving
instructions from Justice Thaddeus Owens.
   Fama was charged with two counts of second-degree murder. He
also was charged with riot, assault, unlawful imprisonment,
menacing, harrassment, discrimination and weapons possession.
   Summations in the case against Fama's co-defendant, Keith
Mondello, also charged with two counts of second-degree murder,
were scheduled for Tuesday. The two were tried in the same
courtroom, but with different juries. Six other youths are to be
tried later.
   The judge rejected a last-minute effort to reopen the defense
case by DePetris, who said a key prosecution witness, Franklin
Tighe, was prepared to recant his earlier testimony.
   Tighe, a 20-year-old Bensonhurst resident with a long history of
mental illness including hallucinations, was the only witness to
say he saw Fama pull an automatic pistol and shoot Hawkins.
   Since taking the witness stand on April 27, DePetris said, Tighe
contacted him and said he wasn't standing next to Fama when Hawkins
was shot, as he had testified.
   ``It's too late now,'' the judge said in refusing to allow
Tighe, who was waiting outside the courtroom, to take the stand.
``The whole thing sounds suspicious to me.''
   The exchange took place outside the presence of the jury.
   After Owens refused to reopen the trial, DePetris showed
reporters a 26-minute videotaped interview of Tighe in which the
witness says he wasn't standing next to Fama.
   DePetris told the jury Tighe believed what he was saying when he
testified. But he said that the stress of coming upon Hawkins who
was dying on the street triggered hallucinations in the mentally
unstable man.
   In his summation, Boyar was highly critical of the many
residents of the mostly white neighborhood who saw much or all of
the attack but refused to come forward.
   He spoke of the door stoops ``where the brother and sisterhood
of Bensonhurst sat, watching but not seeing, hearing but not
listening'' as Hawkins was surrounded by a white mob and shot
through the chest.

<HEAD>White House ``Open Debate'' on Budget May Include Talk of New
Taxes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House put aside President Bush's
pledge against new taxes and said Monday that talks to strike a
budget deal with Congress will have ``no preconditions.''
   Although Bush's position on taxes ``is well known,'' he wants
``an open debate that is unfettered with conclusions about
positions taken in the past,'' said his press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Republicans involved in talks on Capitol Hill praised the White
House's acknowledgement that all ways of reducing the deficit would
be negotiable.
   ``That's the only way he can do the job,'' said Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee.
   ``There isn't any president who hasn't tried to make good on his
promises. There's no president who hasn't lived through times that
change, and maybe outdate some promises,'' he said.
   But Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, predicted it would be tough to pass a
budget that includes tax increases.
   ``It would be hard to get anybody to agree to that, not just
Republicans,'' Domenici said. ``The question is overall, how strong
is the package in deficit reduction ... so tradeoffs are worth it.''
   Fitzwater said Bush intends to follow up his Sunday night
session with the four top congressional leaders with further
meetings with lawmakers this week to discuss how to ``break the
logjam'' that has persisted nearly a decade.
   He will talk strategy on Tuesday with House and Senate
Republican leaders and hopes to hold another bipartisan session
later in the week, Fitzwater said.
   Sixteen leading House and Senate Democrats met for an hour in
the Capitol and said afterward that they would consult with
rank-and-file lawmakers Tuesday.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the
leaders discussed who would be involved in talks with the
administration and when the discussions would start.
   Asked if the members at the meeting agreed that negotiations
should begin, Mitchell said, ``Various opinions were expressed.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he believed
congressional Democrats would inform the White House about their
desires by Wednesday.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
he was willing to consider new levies, including excise taxes and
raising the income tax rate for top-income taxpayers, particularly
if Bush continues to seek a cut in the capital gains tax.
   ``If he's talking about reducing capital gains then I think
obviously one of the places you look at is'' the tax rate, Bentsen
said in an interview.
   He said Democrats would not require Bush to endorse publicly a
specific tax increase as a precondition to agreement.
   ``I think that it's a question of walking that plank together,''
he said.
   Many Democrats have advocated raising the maximum income tax
rate to 33 percent for the 600,000 wealthiest Americans, who now
pay a 28 percent rate. Some members of both parties have also
talked about boosting levies on gasoline, imported oil, cigarettes,
beer and alcohol.
   The administration negotiated with members of Congress last year
on a compromise budget, but the White House is pursuing a
bipartisan budget pact even more intensely this year.
   Fearing that rising interest rates would seriously damage the
economy, the administration initiated the budget talks following
the recent approval of rival $1.2 trillion budget propsals by the
full House of Represenatives and the Senate Budget Committee.
   Bush shares with congressional leaders ``anxiety over a deficit
that is fighting every reduction attempt that we can come up,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush's own fiscal 1991 budget was never seriously considered by
Congress, and the administration claims both House and Senate
measures would fall short of reducing the deficit _ over $150
billion this year _ to the $64 billion required under the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   Failure to make this target will touch off automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts.
   Congressional leaders have said that getting the deficit down to
the required range to avoid the automatic trigger would almost
certainly require substantial tax increases.
   Fitzwater's comments Monday generally reflected what
participants in Sunday night's White House meeting had reported:
that Bush had assured them everything was on the table.
   At his daily briefing for reporters, Fitzwater repeatedly
declined to say whether Bush's 1988 campaign vow of ``no new
taxes'' was still in force. Bush has not repeated his promise in
months.
   ``The president and the leadership tried to come to this with an
open mind,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said one of the ``operating principles'' Bush and the leaders
_ Mitchell, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and House Republican Leader
Robert H. Michel of Illinois _ agreed to was ``that there are no
preconditions.''
   ``Anyone can bring up an issue for discussion and debate,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush and the lawmakers also agreed ``that they can't negotiate a
budget in public, that it does take a lot of give-and-take and
moving back and forth. So we'll try to keep a little mystery in the
marriage.''
   The spokesman said the leaders also agreed that talks would ``go
until we achieve a budget that all sides can agree on.''
   Fitzwater said such details as who would participate in the
budget talks, where they would be held and how active a role the
president would take, had not been decided.

<HEAD>Italian Communist Party Suffers More Declines in Local Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian Communist Party failed to stem its
decline in local elections Sunday and Monday in 15 of the country's
20 regions, partial results indicated.
   The long-dominant Christian Democrats suffered small losses and
the Socialists, Italy's No. 3 party, scored gains, according to
early results and to projections on state TV's evening newscasts
more than eight hours after polls closed.
   Local parties demanding greater regional autonomy in Lombardy
and Veneto in the north showed surprising success.
   Up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments, 87
provincial governing councils and 6,374 city governments. City
elections were not being held in such major centers as Rome,
Naples, Trieste, Catania and Bolzano.
   By 10 p.m., results were complete in two-thirds of the
precincts. Complete official results were expected Tuesday.
   The elections were considered an important barometer of support
for the governing coalition, which includes Christian Democrats and
Socialists, and for the Communists, who decided on a new course at
an extraordinary congress in March.
   With 49,267 of 73,965 precincts reporting, the Communists had 24
percent, down from 30.2 percent in regional elections five years
ago and from 27.8 percent in parliamentary voting in 1987.
   Christian Democrats had 33.8 percent, down from 35 percent five
years ago and from 34.2 percent in the 1987 parliamentary vote.
   The Socialists had 14.7 percent, up from 13.3 percent and 14.3
percent, respectively.
   The Communist Party has been steadily losing strength after
coming to the brink of power a decade ago. It decided to enter a
transition phase that could lead to changing its name and dropping
its hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   But the move angered many old-line Communists, and party leader
Achille Occhetto said he would be content with 23 percent of the
vote.
   Occhetto said on state TV that the party's poor showing would
not alter the Communist reformist course. ``To do otherwise would
be catastrophic,'' he said.
   He indicated the decline reflected the beatings taken by Eastern
European leftist parties in recent elections following the toppling
over the past year of Communists regimes there.
   Final projections indicated the Communists would get 23.6
percent, down from 30.2 percent five years ago and 27.8 percent in
1987; the Christian Democrats 33.1 percent, down from 35 percent
five years ago and 34.2 percent in 1987, and the Socialists, 15.4
percent, up from 13.3 percent and 14.3 percent, respectively.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, had said that
major shifts in the voting could cause his government to collapse.
The coalition includes three small parties: Republicans, Social
Democrats and Liberals.
   Christian Democratic Party Secretary Arnaldo Forlani said the
results ``encourage the commitment of the (coalition) government to
go forward.''

   Four more people died of injuries from the
weekend crash of a U.S.-manned cargo plane in a crowded residential
area, raising the death toll to 23, Guatemalan aviation authorities
said Monday.
   A Civil Aeronatics Administration news release said the four
died late Sunday and early Monday in hospitals, and that five
people were still missing. It said 12 people are hospitalized, some
in serious condition.
   Two of the dead have still not been identified, the news release
said.
   The Miami-bound DC-6, a vintage four-engine propeller cargo
plane, crashed shortly after takeoff from the capital's
international airport Saturday night, killing all three crew
members. The rest of the victims were on the ground.
   The cause of the crash has not been determined. But Civil
Aeronautics said when the plane arrived Saturday in Guatemala, it
underwent repairs for an engine problem.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Dickmayer said three U.S. civil
aeronautics experts are directing the investigation of the crash.
Fire chief Harold Juarez said rescue squads had been picking
through the wreckage of 16 homes in the plane's path.
   The plane, belonging to Miami-based Aerial Transit Co., was
carrying a cargo of snow peas and cloth.
   Tom Stocks, vice president of Aerial Transit, said by telephone
that there were no problems with the plane when it left Miami.
   But when the crew tried to take off for the return flight, he
said, ``They apparently had some problem with one engine, and as
they were making the go-around, apparently it crashed.''
   The crash set off a fireball fueled by propane tanks in
neighborhood homes.
   ``It was a big ball of fire that burst when the right wing of
the plane destroyed the house next door and exploded,'' said
Lorenzo Hoehn, a resident who saw the crash.
   ``I saw how children came out like torches and my neighbors were
burned to death without us being able to do anything to save
them,'' he added. ``It was something horrible, like a nightmare. We
thought it was the end of the world.''
   The crew members were identified by Aerial Transport as Capt.
Joseph Babody of Detroit; co-pilot John Theodorou of Vero Beach,
Fla.; and engineer Dallas White of Miami Springs, Fla.

   A 12-member Soviet advance team met Monday
with U.S. officials to discuss logistics for the May 30-June 3
superpower summit, the White House said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting was
``the first formal full session of the U.S. and Soviet advance

   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin and Joseph Reed, the U.S.

   Soviet officials have toured the White House and Andrews Air

   Business sessions will be conducted at the White House,
Fitzwater said.
   The White House, he said, was not ready to announce whether
President Bush would take Gorbachev to an out-of-town site, such as
Camp David, Md., for informal talks during the five-day session.

<HEAD>Court Holds Salvadoran Death Squad Threat Grounds For Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Salvadoran death squad's threatening
letter to an accountant for a land-reform group gave him legitimate
grounds to seek political asylum in the United States, a federal
appeals court ruled Monday.
   The death squad was ``arguably tied to (El Salvador's)
government,'' the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said. The 3-0
ruling barred the planned deportation of Wilfredo Mendoza Perez and
ordered reconsideration of his request for political asylum.
   Though the government did not control the death squad, testimony
about the killings of others who worked for Mendoza's organization
suggested that people in such groups were in danger, the court
ruled.
   The threat to Mendoza was specific and real, and persecution was
more likely than not if he returned to El Salvador, the court said.
   ``Given Mendoza's involvement with a land reform organization
and the apparent right-wing death squad, Mendoza's testimony that
his feared persecution is politically motivated finds support in
the record,'' said the opinion by Judge Jerome Farris.
   Mendoza testified that he was an accountant with the Salvadoran
Communal Union for almost five years before he left the country and
entered the United States illegally in 1982. He said he had been
helping landless farmers form and manage cooperatives throughout
the country.
   The court decision reversed a Board of Immigration Appeals
ruling that denied Mendoza's request to stop his deportation. Since
asylum is at the discretion of the Attorney General, that portion
of the case was sent back to the Justice Department for a decision.
   Mendoza lives in Phoenix with his wife and children. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation
proceedings after arresting Mendoza about 10 months after he
arrived in the U.S.
   An INS judge denied Mendoza's request to stop his deportation
and receive political asylum. The Board of Immigration Appeals
affirmed that decision in October 1988.
   Mendoza said that shortly before he left El Salvador, he
received a letter threatening him if he did not leave the country
within 48 hours. He said officials of the Salvadoran Communal Union
told him to take the threat seriously.
   His attorney, Carolyn P. Blum, called the appeals court's
decision and Mendoza's prospects for asylum ``exciting and
wonderful for him.'' She said the INS board's decision had been
outrageous.
   She said the decision would send a message that the ``people who
actively participate and work with groups in countries like El
Salvador and Guatemala can receive asylum in the United States.''
   Philip Waters, acting regional director for the INS in San
Francisco, declined comment on the case until he and officials in
Washington studied the decision.

   Thousands of Israelis demanding electoral
reform on Monday booed legislators as they drove past the crowd to
reach Parliament for the opening of the summer session.
   Dozens of police officers held back about 4,000 protesters as
they jeered and waved placards reading ``We are sick of you'' and
``No less than democracy.''
   The rally was the latest protest by a growing electoral reform
movement. The protests were sparked by the political horsetrading
following the March 15 collapse of the ruling coalition of the
left-leaning Labor Party and the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The two rival parties have been trying the past six weeks to
lure defectors from each other's camps with offers of political
posts and money. There were growing signs Monday that another
Likud-Labor coalition could be in the offing.
   Israel television reported both parties were considering a
compromise proposal by the National Religious Party that would
avoid a clear yes-or-no answer to U.S. Mideast peace proposals.
   The coalition government was toppled by Labor after Likud
refused to accept proposals by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III that would lead to an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo.
   At the protest rally in front of Parliament, meanwhile, the
crowd chanted ``We are fed up'' as legislators drove past.
   ``The general feeling is that there is nobody who is actually
representing you,'' said Mike Marmer, a rabbinical student who
immigrated from London four years ago.
   Another demonstrator, veteran Soviet Jewish activist Vladimir
Slepak, said he never expected he would one day protest against the
Israeli government.
   ``In the Soviet Union we knew there was one party and we knew
what they would do. But here nobody knows what will be tomorrow,''
said Slepak, who arrived in Israel after waging a long fight
against Soviet authorities for permission to emigrate.
   Rally organizers accused politicians of abusing democracy and
demanded that President Chaim Herzog appoint an independent
commission to work out a new electoral system.
   The campaign, led by dozens of Israeli mayors and army reserve
officers, has collected more than a half-million signatures.
   Under Israel's current system, voters choose party slates and
the country is treated as one electoral district. A party needs
only one percent of the vote to win a seat in the 120-member
Parliament. No party has ever won enough votes to rule alone and
smaller factions are often cast in the role of kingmaker.
   Israelis are used to protracted coalition negotiations after
each election, but this time neither Labor nor Likud appears able
to break a 60-60 tie.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres failed after five weeks of
negotiations and now caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is
trying to form a ruling coalition without Labor.
   But Shamir's plans have been thwarted by two religious parties,
the National Religious Party and Shas, that support Shamir in
principle but insist that he form another government with Labor.
   Under the National Religious Party's compromise, a new
Likud-Labor coalition would be based on the guidelines of the
outgoing government, including Shamir's proposal to hold elections
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to determine negotiators
for peace talks with Israel.
   But decisions concerning the peace process would be made by the
full 25-member Cabinet, which also includes ministers from smaller
coalition partners.
   In the outgoing government, such decisions were made by the
12-member Inner Cabinet in which only Labor and Likud were
represented. The forum was usually deadlocked along party lines.

   Parliament on Monday elected nine
legislators to act as prosecutors in the trials of the former prime
minister and his deputies, who are accused of wiretapping, fraud
and complicity in a $210 million bank scandal.
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou was indicted by Parliament in
September on involvement in a Bank of Crete scandal and for
authorizing the wiretapping of political friends and foes.
   Four former cabinet members in his socialist government have
been charged along with Papandreou in the $210 million bank
scandal. Former intelligence service chief Costas Tsimas, now a
deputy in the European Parliament, was indicted for involvement in
the wiretapping scandal.
   The men face possible prison sentences of five years to life if
convicted. Trial dates have not been set.
   In another scandal, former deputy finance minister Nikos
Athanassopoulos was scheduled to face trial May 28 on charges of
covering up a 9,000-ton corn sale in 1986 that defrauded the
European Community of trade levies.
   Two deputies from the ruling conservative New Democracy Party
were elected as prosecutors in each of the three cases along with
one member from the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress. Two New Democracy deputies and one Coalition deputy were
also elected as substitute prosecutors in each case.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, which controls 125
seats in the 300-member Parliament, boycotted the vote. The
socialists have denied all charges and claim the trials are
politically motivated.
   The socialists ruled Greece for eight years and were replaced in
June by an alliance between the conservatives and Communists.

<HEAD>Cold Winds Lash Northwest; Flooding Continues in Arkansas, Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong, cold winds continued to batter the Pacific Northwest on
Monday, carrying heavy snow that lashed the Washington Cascades.
Flooding continued in Arkansas and Texas.
   Weather was mild and sunny over much of the nation, with
unusually high temperatures in parts of the upper Plains.
   Gale warnings were posted over the Washington straits and along
portions of California's northern coast as powerful winds continued
to pound the region. The gusts pushed colder temperatures into the
Northwest during the weekend and brought an early morning
temperature of 26 degrees to Colville, Wash.
   Overnight snowfall across the Cascades included 12 inches at
Stampede Pass. There also was snow on the highway through
Snoqualmie Pass.
   Overnight temperatures were expected to drop into the mid 20s in
the Helena Valley of Montana by midweek.
   The Arkansas River approached record heights as flooding
continued in Arkansas and Texas. The river was expected to crest at
Little Rock on Tuesday and Pine Bluff on Wednesday at levels higher
than in the devastating flood of April 1973.
   On Saturday, the river crested at Van Buren, Ark., at the
highest stage since its navigation system was constructed.
   Extensive flooding also continued along the White and Cache
rivers in eastern Arkansas. There was lowland flooding along the
Black and St. Francis rivers in northeast Arkansas, as well as
along the Quachita River in southern Arkansas.
   In northern Texas, the Trinity River was expected to crest near
Trinidad about two feet lower than the record level recorded in
April 1942, but about 15 feet over flood stage near Long Lake.
   Skies were sunny over much of the nation at noon Monday.
Rainshowers were scattered over central New England, from northeast
Pennsylvania into central New York state, over eastern Upper
Michigan, the lower Texas Gulf Coast and southwest Wyoming.
Rainshowers over south central Montana and north central Wyoming
changed to snow at the higher elevations. Snow mixed with rain also
fell over northwest Montana.
   On Sunday, unseasonably warm weather moved into the eastern
portion of the northern Plains and the Mississippi Valley. Noon
temperatures Monday were 15 to 20 degrees warmer than average
across eastern South Dakota and southern Minnesota. Redwood Falls,
Minn., hit 90 degrees by early afternoon.
   The low temperature for the nation Monday morning was 22 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 pm EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 97 degrees at Needles, Calif.

<HEAD>Case Against Military Men in Killing of Priests Said to be Weak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weak prosecution case and
missing evidence make it unlikely those blamed for the November
slaying of six Jesuit priests and two women will be convicted, a
court source said Monday.
   The United States has warned El Salvador it could face a cutoff
of $85 million in annual military aid if it fails to actively
pursue its investigation of the deaths of the priests. The House
Foreign Relations Committee has approved a proposal to that effect.
   The source at El Salvador's 4th Criminal Court, who insisted on
anonymity, told The Associated Press he believed Col. Guillermo
Benavides, commander of the Military School at the time, three
lieutenants and five soldiers charged with the crime stood a good
chance of being acquitted.
   The source said the only evidence introduced against Benavides
is testimony from other suspects. Under Salvadoran law, a person
accused in the same case cannot testify against a co-defendant.
   ``The evidence makes it difficult'' to convict Benavides, the
principal suspect, the source said.
   The difficulties are compounded because the four cadets who
could testify in the case were sent out of the country, the source
said. Also, a logbook and a personal diary that could document
Benavides' movements have been reported by authorities to be lost.
   The disclosures regarding the cadets and the diary were made in
Monday's editions of The New York Times.
   ``All these problems raised obstacles to the court's effort to
find out if any other high-ranking military men are involved or are
trying to cover up for the murderers,'' the source said.
   Gen. Humberto Larios, the Defense Minister, said sending the
cadets abroad was ``part of a project'' but ``if the judge
considers the presence of the cadets convenient, they could be
recalled.''
   A personal diary that Benavides was reported to have kept has
also not been found, the source said. The source said Benavides
mentioned the diary out of court, but later denied it existed.
   ``No one has seen the diary. The court never had possession of
it, as far as I know,'' the source added.
   The court also asked the high command for the academy guard
logbook, which would show who entered and left the academy Nov.
15-16. But the military claimed it was lost, the source said.
   The six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were rousted
from their beds by uniformed soldiers at the Central American
University campus the night of Nov. 16 and shot to death.
   The slayings occurred during the worst offensive by leftist
guerrillas in a decade of civil war. The campus, branded a bastion
of leftist thought by conservatives, was under military control and
a dawn-to-dusk curfew at the time of the killings.
   The four cadets on guard duty at the Military School the night
of the murders were sent to the United States and Panama, the court
source said, and when the judge asked them to testify, he was told
they were out of the country.
   Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, a retired officer, publicly accused
the military high command of protecting those who ordered the
killings.
   Ochoa, now a National Assembly member from the conservative
ruling ARENA party, said Benavides carried out the slayings on
orders from above. But he did not offer proof.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is handling the case, refused to talk
to reporters. But the source said he recently had a long interview
with officials of the U.S. Embassy.
   About 72,000 people have been killed in El Salvador's civil war,
mostly civilians slain by rightist death squads.

   Lotte Jacobi, a photographer known for her
candid portraits of such renowed figures as Albert Einstein and
Eleanor Roosevelt, has died at age 93.
   Jacobi died Sunday at the Havenwood Retirement Community. The
cause of death wasn't disclosed.
   During her career, which spanned seven decades, celebrities
sought out Jacobi because of her ability to capture them during
private moments or in unusual poses.
   Some of her most famous photographs were of Einstein, including
at least one that was turned down by Life magazine because its
editors thought the shot _ of Einstein lounging in a leather jacket
_ did not treat him with enough respect.
   Other portraits included Mrs. Roosevelt, poet Robert Frost,
actors Peter Lorre and Lotte Lenya and composer Kurt Weill.
   Jacobi said she relied on her intuition, for knowing whom to
photograph and how to photograph them.
   ``Most people have a preconceived idea about other people, about
what the other one has to be,'' she said in an interview in 1978.
``I don't care for a person's station in life, I care for the
person.''
   Jacobi was born in Thorn, West Prussia, Germany, in 1896 and
studied at the Bavarian State Academy of Photography and the
University of Munich. She moved to Berlin in 1920, where she later
ran her father's photography studio.
   In 1935, she fled Nazi Germany and moved to New York, where she
opened her own studio.
   Later in her career, Jacobi invented a type of photography known
as photogenics, a technique that did not require use of a camera.
Jacobi would draw patterns of light on film, using reflected light
from candles and flashlights. She then would photograph the
resulting lines and images of light.
   Jacobi moved to New Hampshire in 1955 and opened a studio in
Deering. She became active in state and national Democratic
politics and was visited by many presidential candidates as they
trekked to New Hampshire for its earliest-in-the-nation primary.
   Jacobi had lived at the Havenwood Retirement Community since
1985.
   She is survived by a sister, Ruth Jacobi-Roth of California and
two daughters-in-law, Bernadette Hunter, of Paris, France, and
Beatrice Trum-Hunter of Deering.

<HEAD>Key Post in Monarchy Abolished, Christians Demand Religious
Freedom</HEAD>

   Nepal on Monday abolished a key post that
preserved the monarchy's monopoly on power, and a leader of the
opposition-led government reported Nepal's king has pledged
cooperation in working toward democracy.
   Nepalese Christians also demanded an end to a 32-year-old law
banning religious conversion and called for the establishment of a
secular state in this Hindu kingdom.
   In an evening radio broadcast, Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai announced the post of zonal commissioner had been
abolished.
   There are 14 such commissioners in Nepal, each responsible for
administering a separate region and appointed by the king. The
Nepali Congress Party, which heads the coalition government,
alleges these commisioners were responsible for suppressing
activists during the recent democracy movement.
   The opposition claims hundreds of people were killed during the
two-month campaign for multiparty democracy that forced King
Birendra to surrender his stranglehold on political power. Police
arrested hundreds of protesters.
   Nepali Congress Party Secretary General Girija Prasad Koirala
urged Monday that legal action be taken against at least seven
zonal commissioners who he said were responsible for ordering
crackdowns on pro-democracy activists.
   Bhattarai, a longtime opposition leader, last month was
appointed head of an interim coalition government made up of
opposition parties, including Nepali Congress and leftist parties.
   The coalition pressed the king to agree to a multiparty system
and scrap a 29-year-old ban on political parties. Multiparty
elections are expected within a year.
   Koirala met the king Sunday and said Monday that Birendra gave
assurances of his cooperation in drafting a new constitution.
   The king also promised Bhattarai would have sufficient powers to
accomplish his task of establishing a democracy, Koirala said.
   The call for greater religious freedom came as 1,500 Protestants
kicked off a five-day religious convention organized by the
Katmandu-based Nepal Christian Fellowship.
   The convention called for a revision of the 1958 constitution
that bans religious conversion and urged the government to nullify
a 1965 law prohibiting proselytism. Under that law, proselytizers
can be sentenced to up to six years in jail.
   Convention participants demanded that 29 Christians serving
various jail sentences be immediately released, and cases against
200 other Christians dropped.
   Nepali Congress Party elder Ganesh Man Singh assured the
Christians that his party, which heads the new government, would
release the imprisoned Christians and drop charges against the
others.
   Nepalese Christians say there are 35,000 to 40,000 Christians in
Nepal. The government says there are only 3,000.
   Most of the Christians are Protestants not affiliated with
international denominations. About 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million
people are Hindus, the rest mostly Moslem and Buddhist.

   More than 300 homes were evacuated by Monday because of a slowly
rising river in central Arkansas, and a Texas river on a record
rampage claimed scores of homes as it bulged out to 2 miles wide.
   A reservoir on the Texas-Oklahoma line hit a record of more than
27 feet above normal after flooding more than 80 homes and began
falling Monday _ but only at a rate of about 6 inches a day.
   Thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather during the past
two weeks, one in Oklahoma and the rest in Texas.
   Texans living in rural areas south of Dallas were fleeing
flooded homes as the Trinity River _ swollen from the worst
northern Texas flooding in more than 80 years _ rolled slowly
southward through homes, fields and pastures toward the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Near Palestine, about 90 miles southeast of Dallas, Red Cross
officials said about 50 homes had been destroyed or sustained major
damage Sunday in the lakeside community of Long Lake.
   ``We can't tell exactly how many residences are affected yet,
because we can't count underwater,'' said Bill Walters, manager of
a Red Cross shelter set up in a campground about 100 feet from the
river.
   He said the victims ``saved practically nothing. The water came
up too quickly.''
   Walters said that although the Trinity had widened to about two
miles at Long Lake, many residents were reluctant to leave.
   ``These people are pretty stubborn, as all Texans are. They
think they can stick it out, but they really can't do it,'' he said.
   In spite of the amount of water at Long Lake, Anderson County
sheriff's dispatcher Troy Freeman said he'd been told the river
wouldn't crest there until Friday.
   And 90 miles back up river, water still had not fully drained
out of a Dallas neighborhood. Monday was the fifth day residents of
the Rochester Park neighborhood ere out of their homes. More than
400 people were evacuated late last week before the water rose
above rooftops.
   In Trinidad, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, at least 150
people had been evacuated and main roads reported closed.
   In central Arkansas, relief workers stayed busy around the clock
shoring up levees, sandbagging and helping residents rescue valued
items from homes likely to be inundated by the Arkansas River.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton added two more counties to last
week's disaster declaration Monday, bringing the total to 29
counties.
   An estimated 325 houses were evacuated in six counties, said
state Office of Emergency Services spokesman Gary Talley.
   The river was expected to crest 5 feet above flood stage Tuesday
at Little Rock. Downstream in the area of Pine Bluff, water was up
to 3{ feet deep in homes in some low-lying areas, officials said.
   Officials said the flooding along the Arkansas River was the
worst since a 1927 rampage that prompted construction of many of
the levees along the river.
   Lake Texoma on the Texas-Oklahoma line crested during the night
at a record 644.76 feet above sea level, or nearly 5 feet above the
overflow spillways, only the second time since the dam was built
that water flowed out the spillways.
   Mike McCoy of the Army Corps of Engineers said he expects it
will take 45 to 60 days for the lake to return to a ``decent''
level as the Corps plans to try to lower it by 6 to 9 inches a day.
   A preliminary survey Sunday found 83 homes at least partially
submerged in Oklahoma's Marshall County, which is partly cut off
from the outside by the swollen lake, which has flooded some
highways.
   Highway flooding made life strange for Judy Peterson, who works
in Madill, Okla.
   Instead of simply driving the 18 miles from her home on Sand
Point to the office, she and her husband now must first take a boat
a half-mile and then drive a circuitous 56-mile route around the
northern edge of Lake Texoma and back to Madill. They'd been doing
that for a week as of Monday.
   ``It's really getting old,'' she said.

<HEAD>President Doe Calls for Negotiations with Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberian President Samuel Doe called for
negotiations with rebel forces Monday on ending their four-month
insurgency, the state News Agency of Nigeria reported.
   Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Nigerian President
Gen. Ibrahim Babanbida at Lagos airport, Doe said the rebels should
come to Liberia's capital, Monrovia, so ``we can iron out the
differences. Power is not gotten in the forest,'' NAN reported.
   On Thursday Doe sent a delegation to Washington asking for a
meeting between Liberian exiles and U.S. officials to discuss ways
to end the fighting. But Doe has repeatedly refused to negotiate
with rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   The rebels are believed to be supported by Libya.
   The State Department said Wednesday that 380 American officials
and their dependents had left Liberia as rebel forces move within
striking distance of Monrovia.
   There were about 500 American officials in Liberia before the
fighting broke out.
   Liberian rebels invaded from the Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. Since
then the insurgents have won control of most of eastern Nimba
county, bordering Ivory Coast, and are fighting in three other
counties.
   Doe said the guerrillas' hit-and-run tactics in mountainous
terrain have made them difficult for government forces to combat.
   ``We are trying to protect lives and property and at the same
time contain the rebels. It has not been easy,'' Doe said.
   The U.S. Congress has passed a resolution condemning Doe's
forces for killing civilians while trying to put down the
incursion. Taylor's rebels have been accused of killing
non-combatants in response to government attacks on their
supporters.
   International relief agencies estimate 250,000 Liberians have
been uprooted from their homes since the fighting started. Many
have gone to neighboring Guinea or the Ivory Coast.
   
   Earlier Monday, Doe met with Togolese President Gnassingbe
Eyadema and asked him to press Ivory Coast authorities to block
Taylor's forces from receiving supplies across the Ivorian frontier.
   Liberia, a West African country with about 2.4 million
residents, was founded a century and a half ago by freed American
slaves and generally has had close ties with the United States.

   A center-right party that advocates
Croatia's independence from the rest of Yugoslavia took a
commanding lead Monday in early returns from the final round of the
republic's first free elections in 50 years.
   With partial votes from 95 constituencies counted, candidates
for the Croatian Democratic Union were leading in 48
constituencies, the Communists were ahead in 34 districts and
independents and other smaller parties led in the remaining 13.
   The vote is considered crucial to the future of the fragile
Yugoslav federation.
   The apparent victory of the Croatian Democratic Union is likely
to exacerbate political and ethnic tensions with Yugoslavia's five
other constituent republics _ particularly with Serbia, the
country's largest republic.
   About 1.5 million Croatians voted Sunday and Monday in 111
constituencies throughout the republic for the remaining 225 seats
in the region's parliament. Final results were not expected until
Tuesday at earliest.
   In the first round of voting April 22-23, the Democratic Union
won 104 of the 131 seats decided for the 356-seat tricameral
regional parliament.
   The Croatian Communist Party, renamed the Party for Democratic
Reform, gathered only 13 seats in the first round, while the
centrist Coalition for National Accord, considered a pre-election
favorite, won three.
   ``Croatians voted for us because we have offered them democracy
to replace years of one-party monopoly,'' Democratic Union leader
Franjo Tudjman said in a Monday interview.
   ``Now we have to start fulfilling everything we promised to our
voters,'' he said, celebrating his apparent victory with champagne
at the party's Zagreb headquarters.
   Tudjman waged his party's campaign largely on nationalist
sentiments, advocating Croatia's political and economic
independence from the rest of Yugoslavia.
   He says Yugoslavia's republics should become independent states
and establish relations only if they have common interests.
   The reform Communists say the national federation model is
adequate but if it fails to reflect the republic's needs in the
future, Yugoslavia should become a confederation without central
rule.
   Tudjman, 66, became Yugoslavia's youngest army general, but
later spent five years in jail after being convicted of Croatian
nationalism and hostile activities against the state.
   His bid for power has fueled a rivalry between Croatia, the
second-largest republic, and Serbia that dates to the creation of
Yugoslavia after World War II.
   Serbia's media, strongly influenced by the republic's hard-line
Communist leaders, has accused the Democratic Union of fascism.
   Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two
autonomous provinces torn by ethnic and ideological tensions.
   Croatia and Slovenia are pushing for democratic reforms and
closer ties with the West. The center-right DEMOS coalition won
April's free parliamentary elections in Slovenia, and is
establishing the first non-Communist regional government in
Yugoslavia in more than 40 years.
   Serbia and Montenegro have not legalized opposition parties.
   Macedonia and Bosnia plan free elections this year.

   State Sen. Andrew Jenkins was convicted Monday
by a federal jury in a scheme to help a supposed Texas financier
launder $150,000 in cash through a bank in Zaire.
   The financier was really an undercover FBI agent, who arrested
Jenkins after giving him a briefcase with the money at a Manhattan
hotel in August 1987.
   Jenkins, 48, was charged under a seldom-used law that makes it a
crime to accept deposits without authority to engage in banking
business in the United States. He also was charged with using the
telephone in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to
promote a crime.
   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Charles Metzner set July
26 for sentencing.
   Jenkins' seat became vacant upon his conviction.
   Jenkins, a Democrat who represents the borough of Queens, showed
no emotion as the verdict was announced and left the Manhattan
courtroom without commenting.
   Prosecutors said Jenkins took the money to conduct business with
the Afro-American Development Bank in Zaire. Prosecutors said he
was part owner of the bank.
   The defense said Jenkins never owned a bank in Zaire but took
the money as an investment to create one.
   Defense attorney Samuel Abady said the charge against Jenkins
was a ``made-up crime.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Standiford said the statute
had been used before, most recently about two years ago in another
money-laundering case, which also ended in a conviction.
   Another judge had, in 1988, dismissed an additional charge that
Jenkins had violated a law requiring disclosures to U.S. Customs of
overseas bank transactions of more than $10,000. The count was
dropped on grounds that Jenkins had not taken the money out of the
country.
   The case began in May 1987 when a man named Louie Moore pleaded
guilty to selling stolen and counterfeit checks and agreed to give
the FBI information about 12 people, including Jenkins, Standiford
said.
   He said Moore introduced Jenkins to the undercover agent posing
as Dan Garth, a Texan with cash to be ``cleaned up.''
   Taped conversations revealed that Jenkins devised a plan to put
Garth's money in the bank in Zaire, then use it to finance a lumber
project there, with profits going to Garth, the prosecutor said.
   Abady described Jenkins as a diligent legislator who had worked
to promote African trade.
   He dismissed Moore as a ``thief and con man who cut a deal.''

   A Tamil lawmaker was ambushed and shot
to death Monday outside the Canadian diplomatic mission where he
had gone for a visa, police said.
   Four attackers fired at Sam Thambimuthu's car, which had stopped
outside the Canadian High Commission, according to police.
   Thambimuthu, a lawmaker of the Tamil United Liberation Front,
had an appointment at the High Commission and he was to travel to
the United States on a State Department-sponsored program later
this week, police said.
   Thambimuthu, 57, was shot in his head and chest and died before
he could be given aid, police said. Thambimuthu's wife Kala, 48,
who was also in the vehicle, was critically injured. Their driver
was unhurt.
   Police declined to comment on the killers, who fled on two
motorcycles after the afternoon attack.
   The newspaper Sunday reported that the government had alerted
all United Liberation Front lawmakers and other Tamil political
parties that a 15-member hit squad was in Colombo. The newspaper
did not identify the group.
   The front, considered a moderate Tamil political party, joined
three pro-Indian former Tamil rebel groups to take part in the
February 1989 general elections.
   Ten lawmakers of the joint front, including Thambimuthu, were
elected to the 225-seat Sri Lankan Parliament.
   Thambimuthu has been strongly critical of the most dominant
Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. His wife
was abducted by the Tiger rebels in December last year, but was
later released.
   A Tiger rebel in northern Jaffna town said his group was unaware
of the killing and declined to comment.
   Last July, unidentified assailants shot and killed the United
Liberation Front's secretary-general, Appapillai Amirthalingham,
and another senior member in Colombo.

   Two Colombians who claim links to the
Medellin drug cartel were in custody Monday, accused of trying to
buy Stinger missiles to use against aircraft carrying Colombian
officials, the FBI said.
   The two men agreed to hand over $1 million in cocaine profits as
a down payment for 120 Stingers and 50 automatic rifles, plus a
plane to transport the weapons to Colombia, FBI Agent Charles A.
Salemme testified at a court hearing.
   The suspects, claiming to work for reputed cartel kingpin Pablo
Escobar, said bribed officials would help them smuggle the weapons
for attacks on the anti-drug Colombian government.
   The suspects told undercover agents they would pay $5 million _
from the planned sale of 400 to 600 kilos of cocaine _ for the
plane and the weapons, and $1 million to the people who would steal
the weapons, Salemme told a federal magistrate.
   FBI officials said a Stinger sells for about $14,000 on the
legitimate arms market. The shoulder-fired missile uses an infrared
homing device to aim itself at the heat generated by an aircraft's
engine. It has proven highly effective against low-flying aircraft.
   The 4-foot-long, 35-pound missiles were to be used against
official Colombian government aircraft, according to Allen
McCreight, FBI chief in Tampa.
   But he said investigators weren't aware of specific plans by
drug traffickers to assassinate Colombian President Virgilio Barco
Vargas, who has waged war on drug smugglers, or his cabinet.
   ``Our investigation is continuing, but at this point we have not
established that the purpose of the purchase of the missiles was to
be used against any officials and specifically the president of
Colombia,'' McCreight said.
   Violence linked to Colombia's drug lords has claimed the lives
of three presidential candidates in that South American country in
the past year.
   The case is the most recent of several reported attempts by drug
traffickers to obtain Stingers, but federal officials say none of
the earlier negotiations had gone as far as the plot involving the
two men arrested Saturday.
   An undercover drug investigation in Polk County in west-central
Florida eventually led to the federal ``sting'' in the weapons deal.
   ``I think this shows a correlation between narcotics and
terrorism,'' said Polk Sheriff Lawrence Crow.
   ``This time, instead of Stingers, the cartel was stung,'' said
Bonnie Tischler, head of the U.S. Customs Service in Tampa.
   Authorities arrested Alfredo Antonio Ramos-Tinoco, 47, at a
Tampa hotel bar, and Luis Fernando Arcila-Giraldo, 28, near Miami
International Airport.
   Both were charged with conspiracy to receive stolen property and
export arms illegally, as well as aiding and abetting the
importation and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and
cocaine. Both have been ordered held without bond.
   Ramos-Tinoco appeared before a U.S. magistrate Monday in Tampa,
but the hearing was recessed after Ramos-Tinoco said he wanted an
attorney but couldn't afford to pay one. Magistrate Thomas Wilson
told the public defender's office to represent him.
   Arcila-Giraldo appeared before a magistrate in Miami.
   An FBI affidavit said Ramos-Tinoco ``described Luis as a close
associate'' of Colombian drug boss Pablo Escobar. It also said
Ramos-Tinoco ``stated that if this arms exchange deal went well, it
would be arranged for the undercover organization to handle future
transportation of drugs into the United States on behalf of the
Pablo Escobar group.''
   However, McCreight cautioned: ``We have not established these
negotiations were directed or controlled by Pablo Escobar.''
   At a news conference in Miami, FBI agent William A. Gavin said
there was at least one more potential suspect, but that a decision
on whether to charge that person would depend on how the case
unfolded. He also displayed firearms seized from a Miami house
where the two had stayed. Among the guns were a MAC-10 machine gun
with silencer, an AR-15 assault weapon, and a 9mm automatic weapon.
   The traffickers were shown a Stinger brought in from Fort
Stewart, Ga., Crow said, but no weapons exchanged hands. Federal
authorities said there also were discussions of importing narcotics.
   Undercover Polk Sheriff's detectives had spent the past six
months on a drug sting that netted 8{ tons of marijuana plus
$500,000 in cash and led to the weapons deal, Crow said.
   ``We had to learn very quickly what a Stinger missile was and
how much they cost,'' the sheriff said. ``None of us had any idea
what the going price for a Stinger missle was. We had to
improvise.''
   Sheriff's detectives met with the two Colombians on April 18 to
fix the deal for Stingers and automatic weapons to be paid for with
cash from the sale of cocaine, authorities said.
   Then, at a second meeting on May 1 in Lakeland, the detectives
and FBI agents showed the pair a Stinger and agreed on the $1
million down payment, officials said.

   France broke an agreement with New Zealand by
repatriating two French spies convicted in the 1985 bombing of the
Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior, a special tribunal ruled
Monday.
   But it rejected New Zealand's demand that the two be made to
serve their full sentences on a remote Pacific atoll. The panel
instead recommended France pay $2 million to a fund to encourage
friendly ties between the two countries.
   New Zealand's prime minister, Geoffrey Palmer, said that
although the French agents were let off, the decision was a victory
for New Zealand.
   ``The time has come to put this whole sorry, tawdry episode
behind us. It's dominated the relationship between France and New
Zealand since July 1985,'' Palmer told reporters in Wellington.
   He said, however, that New Zealand would continue to oppose
French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The Rainbow Warrior
was to have led a protest flotilla toward a test site on the South
Pacific atoll of Mururoa.
   The French Foreign Ministry, which announced the panel's
conclusions, said it marked the end of the affair. It said
relations between France and New Zealand could now ``develop in the
traditional spirit of friendship.''
   The tribunal was set up after France brought home intelligence
agents Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur, both of whom were
convicted of manslaughter by New Zealand courts.
   They had been sentenced to 10-year prison terms each for their
roles in the July 1985 sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland
harbor, in which a Greenpeace photographer was killed.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord reached in July 1986, the
sentences of the two French agents were commuted to 3-year terms,
to be served on the Pacific atoll of Hao, an isolated French
military base. The accord also ordered France to pay $7 million in
reparations to New Zealand.
   France brought home Mafart in December 1987 and Prieur in May
1988.
   The tribunal concluded, in a majority ruling, that France did
not violate the accord when it repatriated Mafart for health
reasons, without consulting New Zealand, but it said France
committed a ``substantial violation'' by not returning him to the
base later.
   It also ruled France committed ``substantial violations'' when
it brought Prieur home, also without consultations, due to her
pregnancy and her father's poor health. She was not returned to the
atoll either.
   Even so, the tribunal ruled that France was no longer obliged to
return either officer to the atoll because its obligations expired
in July 1989, when the pair's three-year terms would have ended.
   The tribunal was presided over by Dr. Eduardo Jimenez de
Arechaga of Uruguay, a former president of the International Court
of Justice, and two arbitors chosen by France and New Zealand.
   They were Prof. Jean-Denis Bredin, picked by France, and Sir
Kenneth Keith, chosen by New Zealand.
   Keith, in an addendum to the decision, said he disagreed that
French obligations expired with the scheduled end of the sentences,
and argued that the two should finish their terms.
   He also disagreed with the conclusion that Mafart's evacuation
without consultation was acceptable.

   Someone tried to decapitate the
Little Mermaid, the beloved bronze fairytale figure in Copenhagen
harbor, and Danish detectives on Monday were trying to figure out
who _ and why.
   They even assigned a homicide cop to the case.
   The 7-inch cut in the back of the statue's neck, apparently made
with a hacksaw, was discovered Monday by an engineering student,
police said.
   The 76-year-old statue, built in tribute to Danish storyteller
Hans Christian Andersen, depicts a winsome girl-sized mermaid
gazing pensively over the water from her perch atop a rock.
   The Little Mermaid's tale is one of Andersen's best-loved, and
the statue, within stepping distance of the shore along Langelinie
Quay, is something of a Danish national symbol. About 500,000
tourists visit it each year.
   Homocide inspector Jens Christensen said the verdigris, or
blue-green deposits, in the gash indicated the attempt was made at
least several days ago. Analysts were trying to pinpoint the time.
   But so many people touch the statue that fingerprints aren't
likely to provide clues, Christensen said.
   Tourists and locals alike, in their customary cluster at the
quay, were indignant.
   ``It's again a mad person who did this,'' said Ejnar Weikop, a
Dane.
   ``Oh no, not again,'' said Audrey Bates of Sydney, Australia.
``This is ridiculous.''
   The Little Mermaid has been the target of vandals before. The
original head was stolen in 1964. It was replaced by a new one cast
from the original mold.
   In 1984, an arm was taken, but it was found and reattached. The
mermaid has also been marred by graffiti and paint, and one
prankster painted a pink brassiere on her.
   The engineering student, a specialist in metal work, found the
cut _ nearly a third of the way through the neck _ while studying
the statue's earlier repairs, Christensen said. He declined to
disclose the student's name.
   The detective said a conviction could lead to one to four years
in prison for vandalism and damaging public monuments.
   Danish officials were already busy planning repairs.
   ``We will have to solder her together,'' said Finn Plov of the
municipal works department. ``But we don't know yet if she will be
removed with the stone or if we have to built a scaffolding out in
the water around her.''
   He said the damage would not be permanent.
   ``Despite her 76 years, the lady is doing fine after all those
surgeries she has been through,'' said Plov.
   Commercial rights to the mermaid are owned by the descendants of
its creator, Edvard Eriksen, but Copenhagen is in charge of
maintenance. The heirs earn annual royalties of about $750,000.

<HEAD>UNO Faction Says It May Join Sandinistas to Weaken Presidency</HEAD>

   Dissidents in Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro's ruling coalition said Monday they want to weaken her
presidential powers and are willing to team up with their old foes,
the Sandinistas, to do so.
   Mrs. Chamorro won election on the ticket of the 14-party United
National Opposition, ending a decade of rule by the leftist
Sandinistas led by President Daniel Ortega.
   But Mrs. Chamorro, inaugurated April 25, excluded UNO party
leaders when she named her Cabinet. She instead surrounded herself
with technocrats and businessmen with no marked political loyalties.
   She also raised the ire of some in her fragile coalition by
keeping Gen. Humberto Ortega, the former Sandinista defense
minister and brother of the former president, as head of the army.
Mrs. Chamorro has said she will serve as defense minister.
   The president is also on the outs with her vice president,
Virgilio Godoy, who has sided with those angry about Gen. Ortega's
retention.
   The moves aimed at weakening the presidency would come in the
form of constitutional changes. UNO has 51 deputies in the
92-member National Assembly, four short of the 60 percent needed to
pass such measures.
   But Roberto Urroz, the head of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Movement, an UNO member, said the Sandinistas also favor a weaker
presidency.
   The Sandinistas have 39 assembly votes, so presidential foes
within UNO could easily get the 55 votes needed to change the
constitution.
   Under the constitution, passed in 1987 by a Sandinista-run
assembly, the president can veto constitutional changes. That veto
can be overridden by a vote from half the deputies plus one.
   The president also can issue decrees and declare a state of
emergency, and is the supreme commander of the armed forces.
   Urroz, at a news conference, said UNO also plans to introduce
reforms forbidding a president to run for two consecutive terms and
forbidding the military to vote in national elections.
   Other reforms inclue a more independent judiciary.
   Shortly after the Feb. 25 elections, Godoy said UNO's lack of a
60 percent majority in the assembly would not hinder its
legislative effectiveness because ``the Sandinistas created a
strong executive, and now we're the executive.''
   That was before the split within the coalition, which became
evident when Mrs. Chamorro denied Godoy an office in the government
complex.
   Godoy, who left Nicaragua suddenly on an unexplained three-day
trip, now has offices at UNO campaign headquarters.
   A secretary and Godoy's aides have said repeatedly he is not
available to comment on UNO's views on a strong executive branch.

<TEXT>
   Mohawk leaders met
with federal mediators Monday in an effort to end a violent tribal
dispute over gambling that has left two dead on the reservation.
   The meeting began a few hours after a funeral was held at the
St. Regis Catholic Church for 32-year-old Harold Edwards.
   He was killed May 1 in a gunbattle near a barricade in Snye,
Quebec. Another Mohawk was killed near the same barricade, on the
reservation which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border.
   Some Mohawks oppose casino gambling and bingo as an unwanted
outside influence. Supporters note the gambling earns needed cash
for the reservation.
   Outsiders' efforts to end the violence are complicated by the
contention of some Mohawks' rejection of state and federal
jurisdiction on their land.
   A team of 10 mediators from the U.S. Justice Department met for
several hours with representatives from the reservation's elected
councils on the American and Canadian sides as well as the council
of hereditary chiefs.
   The meeting was held to lay the groundwork for negotiations to
try to end the 9-month-old gambling dispute, said Brenda LaFrance,
a spokeswoman for an anti-gambling faction on the reservation. She
said those negotiations could begin Tuesday.
   Indians at Monday's meeting also were expected to respond to
Gov. Mario Cuomo's call for the St. Regis Tribal Council to create
its own police force, which could eventually operate on both sides
of the border.
   ``They expressed an interest to respond to the governor's
proposal,'' said Dan Gaspe, a spokesman for anti-gambling Indian
leaders.
   The tribal police force was abolished in 1981. Since then, there
has been no local law enforcement on the American side of the
reservation, called Akwesasne _ ``where the partridge drums'' _ by
Mohawks.
   Mohawks on both sides of the gambling dispute attended Edwards'
funeral, which was closed to reporters.
   There have been no arrests in either death, but Canadian
provincial police say they expect to make a ``major announcement''
sometime this week about the murder investigation.
   Cuomo said Monday in Albany that he would keep state police on
the reservation while he and tribal officials discuss setting up an
Indian police force.
   The governor also said conditions at the reservation may have
improved to the point where direct negotiations over allowing some
form of legalized gambling could begin.
   About 200 refugees from the Canadian side of the reservation
remained sheltered Monday at the Transport Canada dormitory in
Cornwall, Ontario. They are the last of a group who fled their
homes last week after violence flared.

<TEXT>
   Cuba announced Monday that U.S. government
radio broadcasts beamed to the island will be jammed 24 hours a
day, a move that drew a critical response from the Bush
administration.
   The action marked the latest escalation in the electronic war
between the two countries.
   Cuba began jamming the Voice of America's Radio Marti broadcasts
during the pre-dawn hours last month, then started interfering with
programming between 6 a.m. and noon.
   After the announcement Monday that jamming would be carried out
around the clock, the VOA issued a statement saying, ``We deplore
this action, which is clearly designed to deny the Cuban people
access to uncensored information.''
   The jamming of the broadcasts first began shortly after the
agency started testing TV signals to Cuba on March 27. Cuba has
jammed the TV tests each day since then.
   The aim of both the audio and visual operations of VOA is to
bring news and entertainment to the Cuban people that they can't
get from official Cuban media.
   The Cuban government tolerated the Radio Marti broadcasts for
five years but reacted sharply to the introduction of TV Marti,
calling it a violation of national sovereignty.
   The VOA statement on Monday said, ``The inteference of Radio
Marti and TV Marti broadcasts is an affront to the Cuban people's
basic human right of free access to information.''

   Israel said Monday that a delegation of
Antiguan officials was en route here to find out how a load of
Israeli-made arms bound for the tiny Caribbean nation wound up in
the hands of a Colombian drug lord.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Baruch Bina said after the Antiguans
arrive Tuesday, ``we will start the process of investigating
together what happened.'' Israel army radio said a policeman, a
lawyer and one other man make up the Antiguan delegation.
   Vere C. Bird Jr., public works minister and national security
adviser to his father, Antiguan Prime Minister Vere Bird, has been
implicated in the case. The younger Bird denied wrongdoing, but
stepped down until the issue is resolved.
   In April 1989, Israel delivered to the Antiguan government 100
Uzi submachine guns with short barrels, 400 Galil automatic assault
rifles and matching ammunition, an Israeli official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The shipment ended up at the ranch of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a
notorious drug lord who died last December in a shootout with
Colombian police.
   After Colombian officials discovered the cache, they approached
Israel with serial numbers from 200 Galils made by Israel Military
Industries, a Defense Ministry statement said Monday.
   It said the serial numbers ``were found to match the numbers of
the rifles belonging to the shipment delivered to the Antiguan
government.''
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the administration has expressed concern over the arms
shipment.
   ``Since Israel was the source, our embassy in Tel Aviv has
raised our concern about these arms with the government of
Israel,'' he said, adding that Israeli is cooperating in the
investigation.
   Bina said the weapons deal was brokered by a Maurice Sarfati who
presented a letter introducing himself as an official envoy of
Antigua's Foreign Ministry. Published reports said Sarfati is a
former Israeli army officer.
   ``We received a receipt from the government customs agent in
Antigua that they had received the shipment. We had no idea that
anything went wrong for almost a year,'' Bina said.
   ``Then we got a message from the Antiguan government asking for
the details of who made the order and who received it. They said
the government did not order it,'' he said.
   Sarfati presented to Israeli authorities an order for the
shipment, an end user certificate guaranteeing the arms would be
for sole use of the Antiguan army, and his accreditation letter
from the Antiguan government.
   The letters, on government letterheads, were signed by Bird, Jr.
   The New York Times, quoting Antiguan and U.S. officials, said
Sunday that investigators traced the arms diversion to two former
Israeli army officers, Sarfati and Yair Klein.
   Bina said his ministry could not identify Sarfati as Israeli or
find links between him and the Jewish state.
   However, a woman who answered a telephone registered to a
Maurice Safarti in the Tel Aviv area told The Associated Press on
Sunday that Sarfati no longer lived there, having moved to the
United States.
   Klein returned to his native Israel last year after accusations
surfaced that he trained assassination squads for Colombian drug
lords. Klein denied it, saying he was teaching Colombian farmers
self-defense.
   He says he intended to set up a survival training school in
Antigua for Panamanian rebels seeking to overthrow dictator Manuel
Noriega, now on trial in the United States on drug charges. Klein
said documents linking him to the arms diversion were forged.
   Klein said the guns were meant for his school and he thought
they were ordered by the Panamanians.
   Israel army radio said both Israel's Defense Ministry and a U.S.
Senate subcommittee asked Klein's firm Hod Hahanit (Hebrew for
spearhead) for its version of the affair. The radio quoted security
sources as saying many false documents existed in the arms case,
but none was linked to Hod Hahanit.
   Bina said, ``I don't know about Hod Hahanit. From our point of
view it was a government-to-government deal.''
   The Defense Ministry stated that Klein acted in Latin America
without the required permit and it knew nothing of his involvement
in the Antiguan affair.

   Rescuers on Monday recovered the bodies
of four off-trail skiers who died in an avalanche in the Bernese
Oberland region, police said.
   Officials said three others were missing and presumed dead in
Saturday's avalanche, which would make it Switzerland's deadliest
snowslide in five years. Rescuers were forced to suspend their
search Monday afternoon as warm temperatures increased the danger
of new avalanches.
   The avalanche struck as members of the Swiss Alpine Club's youth
organization were skiing on unmarked trails at about 7,200 feet.
They were in a glacier crevice above Haslital Valley, about 25
miles east of Interlaken.
   Police said the victims whose bodies were found were aged 18 to
27.

   A prosecutor in the second McMartin
Pre-School trial told jurors Monday he hasn't interviewed the three
former pupils who claim they were molested and can't predict how
they will testify.
   ``I don't know in what condition these children will come to
you,'' Deputy District Attorney Joseph Martinez said in his opening
statement. ``I have not talked to them. They are now young ladies
on the verge of puberty.
   ``I don't know how much they will recall, how much they have
repressed,'' he said. But he urged jurors to ``just remember they
are children and they are telling about a very traumatic thing in a
courtroom full of people. It's very traumatic.''
   The retrial of Ray Buckey is a case vastly diminished in scope
from the scores of allegations that once enveloped the family-owned
McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach and seven of its teachers.
The school is now closed.
   The first McMartin trial ended in January when a jury acquitted
Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 12 charges. The same
jurors acquitted the 31-year-old Buckey of 40 charges and
deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   The district attorney's office decided to retry Buckey on eight
counts involving the three children, a greatly diminished number
from the hundreds that were once said to have been molested at the
school. His mother was not retaried.
   The first trial lasted nearly three years and cost $13 million.
It was the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S.
history.
   The second trial is expected to last about six months.
   Martinez, who spoke for less than one hour, said he would prove
his case through the testimony of parents, medical evidence and
videotapes of the children's controversial interviews with
therapists in the case.
   The same tapes, recorded at Children's Institute International,
were cited by jurors in Buckey's first trial as evidence that
children were coerced by therapists into making accusations against
Buckey and his mother.
   Ray Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, told jurors they would see
that the institute's therapists asked leading questions and planted
in the children's minds the idea they had been molested.
   Martinez said he would elicit testimony similar to that at the
first trial that Buckey wore shorts without underwear. And he said
he would show that the defendant once sat reading Playboy magazine
in front of his preschool class.
   Davis asserted that none of the children, of their own volition,
ever accused Buckey of molesting them.
   He promised that the defendant will take the stand, look jurors
in the eyes and declare that he never molested anyone.
   ``You will have the opportunity to see this man charged with
these heinous crimes, to look into his eyes and look into his
soul,'' Davis told the jury.
   Outside court, Davis said he was shocked by Martinez's statement
that he had not interviewed the children.
   He compared the prosecutors to World War II Japanese pilots on a
suicidal mission with insufficient gas for a return flight.
   ``This is nothing but a kamikaze run before the primary
(election),'' Davis said, referring to District Attorney Ira
Reiner's candidacy for California Attorney General.
   ``There is no gas for a return trip for Ira Reiner,'' he said.
   Martinez, however, said he was confident. ``We feel we have the
three best children and the eight best counts. You can't get any
better than that,'' he said.
   The first prosecution witness was the mother of one of the three
children. She said that in the spring of 1983 her daughter
protested going to the McMartin school twice and became fearful.
She also recalled that the child, who was prone to rashes, showed
her mother redness on her bottom.
   ``I asked her if she knew why her body was in that condition and
she didn't give me any answer,'' said the witness.
   On cross-examination, Davis noted that the woman was confused
about dates of other events.

   Prince Charles on Monday hailed
Hungary's role in ``changing the face of Europe'' as he and
Princess Diana began the first official visit by members of
Britain's royal family to a Warsaw Pact country.
   The royal couple were met at the airport by their host, newly
elected interim President Arpad Goencz, the state MTI news agency
reported.
   During their four-day trip, the couple will meet with government
officials, business officials and artists.
   On Monday, Prince Charles visited Parliament, where he met
separately with Goencz, Premier Miklos Nemeth and Prime
Minister-designate Jozsef Antall, the leader of the center-right
Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   Last week, Hungary's new multiparty legislature met for the
first time and elected Goencz, a liberal writer jailed for six
years after the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising, as interim president.
   Antall, whose party gained the most seats in the March and April
elections _ the first freely contested since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948 _ was asked to form the next government.
He is seeking to form a center-right coalition with the like-minded
Independent Smallholders and the Christian Democrats.
   Nemeth formally submitted his Cabinet's resignation but it will
remain as a caretaker government until the new one is formed.
   Goencz presided over a gala dinner held for the royal duo Monday
night.
   At the dinner, Prince Charles said his great-great-great
grandmother, Countess Claudia Rhedey, was Hungarian.
   ``This evening I am especially proud of the Hungarian blood in
my veins,'' he said, according to MTI. He praised Hungary's role in
``changing the face of Europe'' with its early moves toward
political reforms.
   ``Making democracy work is never easy, but the effort is well
worth the bother,'' the prince said.
   Goencz said Hungary now has a ``unique opportunity ... to
irreversibly return to developed Europe,'' the news agency said.
   Upon arrival, their first stop was Heroes' Square, where they
placed a wreath at a monument in honor of Hungarian heroes.
   About 1,500 people gathered at the square. Many applauded as the
couple emerged from their car. The well-wishers included about 100
members of the British community in Budapest.
   ``I think the princess is beautiful,'' said Janos Nagy, a
21-year-old student. ``I have only seen pictures of her.''
   ``I came to see how she looks in real life,'' he said, tapping a
pair of binoculars.
   Amalia Roth, 67, with three grandchildren at her side, said she
had been to Britain before World War II as a young girl. ``I love
England and felt I must come,'' she said.
   The couple's schedule Tuesday included a speech by Prince
Charles at the University of Economics in Budapest. Princess Diana
is to view a display of British fashion at the Museum of Applied
Arts.
   The private jet taking Princess Diana to Hungary diverted to
Gatwick Airport shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport because
of an electrical fault, Buckingham Palace and airport officials
said.
   The four-engine jet of the Queen's Flight spent an hour and 20
minutes on the ground at Gatwick while the fault was repaired, said
Roger Hamson, terminal duty manager for Gatwick Airport. It then
left for Italy, where it picked up Charles before traveling to
Budapest.

   Six climbers from the United States, China and
the Soviet Union gave each other hugs and joyful slaps on the back
after scaling Mount Everest in an ``international peace climb''
Monday, expedition leaders said.
   The climb was billed as an attempt to foster international good
will and to remove litter from the world's highest peak.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said the six reached the
summit of the 29,028-foot mountain Monday afternoon.
   The climbers are Steve Gall of Woody Creek, Colo., who operates
a mountain guide service in Aspen, Colo.; Robert Link of Ashford,
Wash.; Sergei Arsentje and Grigory Lunjakov of the Soviet Union;
and Da Cheme and Gyal Bu of China.
   Six to eight more climbers from the three countries were to
attempt the summit this week.
   Expedition leader Jim Whittaker, reporting Tuesday from an
advanced base camp at 21,325 feet, said the six climbers reached
the summit in good condition and ``spent almost an hour in dead
calm weather.''
   Warren Thompson, deputy leader of the so-called ``Mount Everest
International Peace Climb'' expedition, spoke Tuesday to a news
conference in Seattle via a telephone patch from base camp at the
terminus of Main Rongbuk Glacier in Tibet, elevation 17,100 feet.
   He said the six ``gave each other big hugs and slaps on the
back,'' took photographs and planted flags from their respective
countries before descending to camp, to symbolize the achievement
possible through cooperation.
   Thompson said, ``I think the best word is ecstatic. Everybody
here has got huge grins on their faces and we're very, very happy.
This is really a great accomplishment.''
   A brief video containing still photographs of Sunday's ascent
was played at the news conference. In accompanying audio, Gall was
heard saying once the top had been reached, ``It's balmy up here.''
   The 46-member expedition began ascending Everest in March and
had hoped to put a few climbers on the top on April 22, Earth Day.
   The returning climbers used duffle bags to haul down debris left
on the summit in previous ascents. It was, they said, of supporting
the world environmental movement.
   The climbers neared the peak in late April but high winds forced
them to retreat to base camp. They set out a second time April 30.

   An Irish citizen held since September
in connection with the assassination of white SWAPO leader Anton
Lubowski was freed Monday after the murder charge against him was
dropped.
   Donald Acheson was arrested Sept. 13, the day after Lubowski was
assassinated outside his home. Lubowski was the only white
executive member of the South-West Africa People's Organization
that won last November's elections and became the ruling party in
the newly independent country.
   ``I never did this crime whatsoever and I just want to get out
... out of it,'' Acheson said after he was released.
   He refused to comment when asked if he had worked for the South
African Defense Force's Civil Cooperation Bureau. The secret
organization has been implicated by South African police in the
deaths of Lubowski and a Johannesburg university academic, David
Webster, last May.
   Namibian police issued warrants this year for the arrest of
several former South African police who were members of the Civil
Cooperation Bureau. The men went into hiding and emerged after
March 21, when Namibia became independent from South Africa and the
warrants became invalid.
   The two countries have no extradition treaty.
   Acheson said he came to Namibia last September to look for a job
as a newspaper cartoonist but found none. He said he had previously
done work for Britsh newspapers and U.S. magazines.
   Acheson's passport was returned to him and his lawyer said he
would probably fly Thursday to West Germany before returning to
South Africa where he has a fiancee. Achesion also said he was
considering returning to Ireland, which he said he left ``too many
years ago.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, preaching on a muddy
field in one of Mexico's most impoverished cities, urged the poor
to follow the Roman Catholic Church and reject political leaders
who deny God.
   ``Throughout history there have been many `pastors' _ leaders,
dictators, chiefs, ideologues and creators of opinions or currents
of thought _ who have tried to `shepherd' or guide the people
toward artificial paradises,'' John Paul said in his homily to a
joyous, flag-waving throng of 200,000 people.
   But the only true shepherd, said the pontiff, is one like Jesus
Christ, who ``is ready to give his life for his sheep.'' All
others, one after another, ``showed themselves to be false
shepherds.''
   The Polish-born pope alluded to the reforms that have swept
Eastern Europe, saying the church had defended human rights crushed
by ``political systems with an inhuman face.''
   On the second day of his second visit to Mexico, John Paul also
made an afternoon visit to the coastal city of Veracruz, 200 miles
east of Mexico City, where Roman Catholic missionaries first landed
in the 16th century.
   The pope, speaking to about 20,000 people from a podium set up
along the docks, defended the celebration of the 500th anniversary
of the arrival of Christianity in the New World.
   The ceremonies, set to take place in 1992, celebrating Columbus'
discovery of America have created some ire in Latin America, with
critics saying the church arrived as an instrument of conquest that
brought repression and disease.
   ``The discovery, the conquest, and the evangelization occupy a
decisive, luminous place taken all together, even though they are
not without shadows,'' the pope said in a homily.
   In Chalco, the field where the pope spoke was surrounded by
thousands of gray concrete-block homes topped with corrugated
aluminum slabs anchored by rocks against the wind.
   At least 700,000 people, most of them poor peasants who moved to
the area the past decade, live in the Chalco valley 25 miles
southeast of Mexico City.
   The setting is spectacular, but the snow-capped volcanic peaks
of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl were largely obscured by clouds as
the pope spoke.
   People in threadbare clothes lined unpaved streets that had
turned to seas of sticky mud after a night of rain. ``John Paul II,
the whole world loves you,'' they cried.
   The pontiff earlier held a private meeting with President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari. John Paul made no statement about the meeting,
but the presidential press office said the two ``spoke of the end
of dogmas in the world and in Mexico, and of the changes occurring
in Eastern Europe.''
   It was the only reference to a possible discussion of
church-state relations in Mexico. Although the church is
constitutionally restricted, many of the restrictions are ignored,
and Salinas has been moving slowly toward a more formal recognition
of the status quo.
   The church had a history in Mexico of supporting conservatives
and found itself on the wrong side in the last half of the 19th
century, especially during Benito Juarez's reforms and during the
Mexican Revolution that started in 1910. After the revolution, all
church property was confiscated, numerous restrictions were written
into the 1917 constitution, and relations with the Vatican were
broken in 1926.
   The Vatican announced last month that the pope might travel to
Cuba in December, but John Paul told reporters Sunday on the flight
to Mexico that ``it seems that this project will not be mature'' by
then.
   He said Cuban bishops, the Vatican and the government of
President Fidel Castro have yet to agree on a date. John Paul has
visited every country in Central and South America during his
pontificate, but not Cuba.
   In Mexico, crowds have been smaller than expected because the
rainy season started several weeks early.
   The field at Chalco was divided by fences, and scalpers seized
control of some entrances, charging 10,000 pesos _ about $3.80, or
the daily minimum wage.
   John Paul, speaking from a pyramid-shaped altar decorated with
geometric Aztec designs, embraced a decision by Latin American
bishops to change the church's tradition of siding with the rich
ruling classes.
   ``The church ... wants to give witness to the dignity of man and
be his relief and defense,'' he said.
   However, the pontiff emphasized that the church's first
responsibility was to give spiritual aid, and called on better-off
Mexicans to translate their Catholic faith into help for the poor.
   ``We cannot live and sleep peacefully while thousands of our
brothers, very near to us, lack the necessities for a dignified
human life,'' John Paul told the crowd.
   Since the pope's visit was announced, Salinas has made highly
publicized vists to Chalco to dedicate street lights and electric
lines.
   But John Paul recognized the poverty in which most residents
still live, crammed into small houses without bathrooms or running
water.
   ``In many of you I find the face of the suffering Christ,'' he
said.
   Margarita Pinzon de Rios, 48, of Mexico City, slept overnight in
a car to be able to see the pope. ``He is demonstrating the love he
has for us, the humble,'' she said.

<HEAD>U.S. Considering Boosting Hazardous Duty Pay for Diplomats in
Manila</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is considering
increasing hazardous duty pay for diplomats based in the
Philippines because of threats by Communist rebels, officials said
Tuesday.
   If approved, the 300 U.S. diplomats here would receive a 15
percent pay increase. Such a designation would place the
Philippines in the same risk category as Colombia, Peru, Honduras,
Afghanistan and Lebanon.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Gerry Huchel confirmed the proposal was
under consideration but that it had not yet been implemented.
   Other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
embassy was concerned such a designation would embarass the
government of President Corazon Aquino, which the United States
strongly supports.
   In the past three months, security has been stepped up for all
U.S. government employees here, including diplomats, 300 Peace
Corps volunteers and 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department
employees and military dependents.
   On Saturday, the U.S. military canceled all off-post leaves for
service members and their families after suspected Communist rebels
killed U.S. Marine Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette near Subic naval
base, 50 miles west of Manila.
   Diplomats have been varying routes to work, switching automobile
license tags and taking other security measures to prevent attacks
by Communist rebels.
   The British and Australian embassies have quietly advised their
nationals to avoid travel near U.S. facilities for fear they might
be mistaken for Americans, sources in the diplomatic community said.
   Fears of rebel attacks have mounted because U.S. and Filipino
officials begin talks next Monday on renewing the lease to the six
American military bases here. The lease expires in September 1991.
   The rebels have demanded that Mrs. Aquino close the bases and
have offered peace talks if she does. Mrs. Aquino rejected the
offer.
   The rebels have been waging a 21-year insurgency to establish a
Marxist state.

<HEAD>16-Year-Old Girl Killed in Crossfire Between Soldiers, Militants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old girl was killed Monday in
crossfire between soldiers and Moslem separatists and the
bullet-riddled bodies of two kidnapping victims were found by a
river, officials and newspapers reported.
   In another development, a strike ordered by Moslem separatists
brought businesses to a standstill in this city.
   The deaths raised to at least 352 the number of people killed
since Jan. 20 when India launched a crackdown in Jammu-Kashmir
state on Moslem separatists.
   The girl, identified only as Dolly, was accidentally killed in a
shootout after Moslem militants hurled a grenade at infantry
soldiers patrolling the city center, wounding three troops.
   Soldiers opened fire wounded five militants, and the girl died
instantly after being hit by gunfire, security officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United News of India reported that the bodies of Prof.
Kundanlal Ganjoo and his wife were found on the banks of the Jelum
River, just north of Srinagar. The couple was kidnapped Saturday by
suspected militants.
   Security forces closed off the area and were conducting
house-to-house searches for their kidnappers, the news agency said.
Ganjoo was a professor at the College of Agriculture in Sopore,
north of Srinagar.
   In Srinagar, troops increased patrols on Monday as government
workers opened offices for the summer. Government offices alternate
each year between the winter capital, Jammu, in the south, and the
summer capital, Srinagar.
   Commandos lined the streets and troops placed barricades outside
government buildings. Government workers were moved to work in
police vehicles, accompanied by troops in jeeps and trucks.
   Bands of Moslem youths stoned some of the vehicles and youths
snatched the identity cards of government workers.
   A city-wide strike, called by Moslem separatist groups, brought
the city to a standstill. Shops and businesses remained closed
throughout the day.
   Posters on the walls of Srinagar had called the strike to
protest the annual movement of the capital and warned of reprisals
if the order was ignored. Most Moslem government workers stayed
away from their jobs, official sources said.
   Sporadic gunfire echoed through the city and a curfew relaxation
in several areas of Srinagar was cut short because of violence,
police said.
   The crisis in Kashmir has heightened tension and animosity
between largely Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan.
   India accuses Pakistan of harboring and arming the separatists.
Pakistan denies the charge and says India is brutally crushing a
movement for self-determination.
   The two countries went to war over the Kashmir valley in 1948
and again in 1965. Both nations have claimed Kashmir since they won
their independence from Britain in 1947.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was mostly Moslem, but its
ruler was Hindu and he opted to join India.
   Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems. Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent of India.

<HEAD>California Bank Turned Over to Philippines Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California bank that allegedly was used by the
late Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife to launder
stolen funds was turned over to the Philippine government on Monday.
   The transfer of all shares in the California Overseas Bank, of
Los Angeles, to the Manila government was part of a March 16 plea
bargain agreement in U.S. District Court where Imelda Marcos is on
trial.
   The bank, estimated by a defense lawyer to be worth $20 million
to $30 million, had pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
Other counts involving federal bank insurance fraud and
racketeering conspiracy were dropped as part of the deal.
   The sentence giving the Philippines total control of the bank
was a victory for President Corazon Aquino's government, which
seeks to recover more than $220 million allegedly embezzled by the
Marcoses from the country's treasury during Marcos' 20 years in
power.
   The bank was owned by Robert S. Benedicto, a one-time Marcos
crony who was charged with conspiring to help the former president
shift stolen money to secret Swiss accounts and personal uses.
   Mrs. Marcos is alleged to have participated with her husband in
the embezzlement, using the money to finance a luxury lifestyle and
investments in New York real estate. Co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi,
the Saudi Arabian financer, is accused of helping the Marcoses
conceal ownership of the New York properties.
   Marcos, originally indicted with his wife, died in exile in
Hawaii last September.
   Benedicto, also indicted and listed as a fugitive by the court,
was dropped from the case as part of the plea bargain approved by
Judge John F. Keenan.
   Two former officials of the California Overseas Bank testified
last week that Benedicto had said he bought the institution for $7
million in 1976 because ``the president (Marcos) needed the bank,''
and that he had personally managed several accounts whose owners
were known only to himself.
   Government prosecutors say the accounts belonged to the Marcoses
and were used to launder money being funneled to other accounts, to
buy a Manhattan office building and Mrs. Marcos' jewelry, and to
provide two of the Marcos children with $10,000-a-month allowances.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake occurred Monday night in
the Pacific Ocean off Panama, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
   Spokesman Don Finley said monitors did not believe the quake was
strong enough to cause significant damage on land or major ocean
surface disturbance.
   The tremor was centered about 250 miles southwest of Panama
City, about 100 miles south of Puerto Armuelles or 120 miles
southwest of Santiago. It occured at 8:02 p.m. EDT, which is also
8:02 p.m. Panama time.
   Survey monitors at Golden, Colo., said they recorded the quake
at an estimated 6.2 magnitude on the Richter scale, according to
Finley.
   The quake was reported felt in Veraguas province and in the city
of Santiago.
   The center of the quake was given as latitude 6.9 north,
longitude 82.7 west.
   Every increase of one number on the Richter scale corresponds to
an increase of 10 times in the ground motion.
   On land a quake of 6.5 can cause severe damage in built-up
areas. The San Francisco earthquake of last October was computed to
be a 7.1 magnitude quake.

   First Lady Barbara Bush, on her
first solo foreign mission, on Monday night praised the peaceful
transfer of power to President-elect Rafael Calderon Jr. as
``another triumph of democracy.''
   Calderon was to be inaugurated Tuesday afternoon.
   Mrs. Bush was greeted on arrival late Monday at Juan Santamaria
airport outside San Jose by outgoing President Oscar Arias, Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal and other dignitaries.
   Several dozen boy and girl scouts in beige shirts and blue
bandannas welcomed her with rhythmic clapping, waving small U.S.
flags. The first lady was dressed in a red print dress and blue
jacket, wearing her trademark necklace of faux pearls.
   The first lady headed a U.S. delegation that included her
Spanish-speaking son, Jeb, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba;
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and his wife, Nancy; Luis
Ferre, the former governor of Puerto Rico, and his wife, Tiody; and
Republican media strategist Roger Ailes of New York, who advised
Calderon in his successful campaign.
   Mrs. Bush said she brought the best wishes of the people of the
United States and a letter from President Bush to Calderon wishing
him well as he begins his presidential term.
   ``We come to Costa Rica today to join you in commemorating
another triumph of democracy _ the peaceful transfer of power from
the Arias administration to the Calderon administration,'' Mrs.
Bush said.
   ``Our main purpose for being in San Jose is to join all Costa
Ricans in celebrating those most democratic activities _ the
recognition of the will of the people, the rule of law and the
peaceful participation of all citizens in the selection of their
leaders,'' she said in remarks prepared for delivery on her arrival.
   She also spoke of the Bushes' ``great respect'' for Arias,
winner of the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to promote peace
in the region.
   Mrs. Bush's press office in Washington released the text of her
remarks in advance.

   Authorities abandoned their search Monday
for a boy lost in a boating accident when high winds battered
Washington and British Columbia over the weekend. Boating and other
accidents left at least eight dead and three missing.
   Remnants of the winds reached 30 knots on Monday, forcing those
looking for 5-year-old William Yoeman in the Columbia River to rely
on a plane instead of a boat.
   ``We went back out today and had no luck,'' said Benton County
Sheriff's Capt. Dave Donovan. ``We're going to call it quits
because there's not any place else to look. It does not appear
there's going to be a survivor.''
   Also Monday, a Coast Guard helicopter spotted the body of Brian
Bell, 22, in Puget Sound near the mouth of Discovery Bay, said
Petty Officer Dennis Hall of the Coast Guard's Seattle office.
Later in the day, the Coast Guard recovered the body of Bell's
fishing companion, John Hoscouledge III, 34. The two had been in a
15-foot boat that sank in Saturday's storm.
   A search continued 10 miles east of Port Townsend for another
man who had been fishing by himself, the Coast Guard said.
   The missing boy abandoned a 20-foot pleasure boat with his
mother and two other adults in the Columbia River below Kennewick,
in south-central Washington, when the craft took on water late
Saturday.
   The mother _ Christine Barajas, 26, _ survived and was treated
for hypothermia, shock and minor injuries.
   The other two adults died, one in the river and the other, boat
owner Larry Davis, when he was hit by a train after reaching shore
and going to seek help. Davis appeared shaken and disoriented after
emerging from the cold water, Ms. Barajas reported.
   The gusty winds moved in suddenly Saturday as tens of thousands
of people took to the water to enjoy warm, sunny weather for the
Northwest's traditional opening day of boating season. The gusts
quickly reached 61 mph.
   A gale warning, posted Saturday for the Strait of Juan de Fuca
separating Washington from British Columbia, was reduced to a small
craft advisory Sunday as winds diminished to 10 to 20 knots.
   The bodies of two fishermen were found washed ashore near their
15-foot boat Sunday about five miles east of Port Angeles on the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, said Coast Guard Lt. Jim Beckham.
   A man was found dead on the Nisqually Flats between Tacoma and
Olympia after searchers spotted his small aluminum boat tied to a
tree near the mudflats, Beckham said.
   In southwest British Columbia, one person was killed during a
para-gliding lesson, and another was missing and presumed drowned
after a 20-foot pleasure boat capsized Saturday at the mouth of the
Fraser River south of Vancouver, said Richard Hendrickson, a
Canadian Coast Guard officer.
   An 8-year-old boy Bremerton boy died late Sunday when his canoe
overturned on Lake Sutherland. But authorities later said his death
was not storm-related.

<TEXT>
   A heart transplant patient put on a
heart-assist mechanism after its use was restricted to last-resort
cases died Monday of multiple organ failure.
   Darwin Kramer, 65, died minutes after the two Symbion Inc.
assist devices, which had pumped blood through his transplanted
heart since April 17, and other life support were disconnected,
said University Medical Center spokesman George Martinez.
   Martinez said the cause of death was multiple organ failure.
   Richard Smith, UMC's chief biomedical engineer in charge of
artificial heart and assist devices, said the Symbion devices had
functioned well and caused no problems.
   In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew
approval of Symbion artificial hearts and heart-assist devices,
citing safety concerns. In February, the FDA said it would allow
their use as a last resort.
   Kramer, of Scottsdale, received his new heart March 10. When his
body began to reject it, the two Symbion acute ventricular devices,
called a BIVAD, were implanted ``to let the donor heart recover,''
Smith said.
   The BIVAD, which sits on the abdomen and is connected to the
heart by tubes through the chest, helped Kramer stabilize, Martinez
said.
   But about five days ago doctors discovered a systemic infection
of unknown cause. When Kramer lapsed into multiple organ failure
and doctors saw no hope for recovery, his family was consulted and
life support disconnected, Smith said.
   Kramer had been a candidate for another donor heart since April
28, when doctors determined his rejection of the first one was
irreversible.
   Kramer's BIVAD implant was the second done on a heart recipient
by Dr. Jack G. Copeland, head of UMC's transplant program, but his
first use of a Symbion device since the FDA action.
   Smith said the first UMC transplant patient to receive BIVAD
support had the device for 10 days after her donor heart failed to
start.
   The heart recovered and the woman is alive more than a year
later, he said.

<TEXT>
   ``Once on This Island'' is as endearing as it is
exotic, a lush little musical set in the French Antilles but
telling a love story that has universal appeal.
   Credit director Graciela Daniele and the songwriting team of
Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The show, which arrived over the
weekend at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, explodes with music
and motion. It never stops, thanks to Daniele's exuberant direction
and the nearly continuous use of song and dance.
   This bittersweet fairy tale, based on the novel ``My Love, My
Love,'' by Trinidad-born writer Rosa Guy, tells of the doomed
romance between a simple peasant girl and a wealthy young man. But
it's not condescending or simplistic in its treatment of the
ill-fated lovers. And Ahrens, who adapted the book and wrote the
lyrics, has come up with a leading female character an audience can
cheer. In a season of such effective but emotionally cold musicals
like ``City of Angels'' and ``Grand Hotel,'' that's something rare.
   Ti Moune is the sweetest Caribbean heroine since Ottilie, a role
played by the wonderful Diahann Carroll in Harold Arlen's ``House
of Flowers'' years ago. It's a sympathetic part played to
perfection by a performer with a dazzling smile and an unusual
name, La Chanze.
   The dark-skinned Ti Moune falls for Daniel, the mulatto son of
an island landowner, and saves his life when his sports car crashes
on a winding road. She nurses him back to health, but eventually
the barriers of class and color prove to be too much.
   In Ti Moune's quest for love, she is helped _ and occasionally
hindered _ by a quartet of rambunctious and rowdy gods, deities of
water, earth, love and death. They add a touch of supernatural to
the plot, an other-worldly quality that gives the story much of its
charm.
   The score is completely different from ``Lucky Stiff,'' a daffy,
dumb-fun musical that Ahrens and Flaherty wrote for Playwrights
Horizons several seasons ago. The title character in that show was
a corpse that refused to stay put, and the witty music reflected
the musical's farcical nature.
   Flaherty's music for ``Once on This Island'' is more expansive
and romantic. It embraces a wide range of styles from calypso, like
in the gutsy ``Mama Will Provide,'' to more traditional theater
love songs like ``Forever Yours.'' Ahrens' lyrics are unforced and
fit the music beautifully.
   Daniele has gotten strong ensemble performances from the rest of
the cast, fine singers and dancers all. Particularly effective are
Eric Riley, a sensuous demon of death, and Kecia Lewis-Evans, as a
big-voiced Earth Mother.
   The director's production team _ set designer Loy Arcenas,
costume designer Judy Dearing and lighting designer Allen Lee
Hughes _ has created an atmospheric island environment. A deep blue
set, painted with primitive trees and birds, fills the small stage
and embraces the actors.
   So does Daniele's inventive choreography which becomes an
important part of the story. The dances swirl throughout ``Once on
This Island,'' turning the stage into a tropical never-never land
that won't disappear from memory even after the curtain has fallen.

<HEAD>No Quick End in Sight to Newspaper Woes, Times Mirror Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not since the 1970s have newspaper
advertising sales been so slow, and no quick recovery is in sight
from Times Mirror Co.'s first-quarter earnings slump, company chief
Robert F. Erburu said May 3.
   ``We are experiencing the impact of a very weak economy in the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic area,'' Erburu, Times Mirror's board
chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting.
   He said Times Mirror, whose flagship is the Los Angeles Times,
was making hundreds of millions of dollars in capital investments
at The Hartford (Conn.) Courant, the Newsday editions on Long
Island, N.Y., and in New York City, and the Baltimore Sun
newspapers.
   Those investments won't pay off until the economy recovers, he
said.
   ``The most one can say is that 1990 is proving to be a very
difficult year, and the future course of the economy will be a key
factor in our outcome,'' Erburu said.
   Times Mirror said last week that its first-quarter profits fell
33 percent to $46 million, largely because of slow advertising at
its Northeastern papers, consumer magazines and broadcast
television operations.
   The first-quarter falloff was felt through much of the industry.
On May 3, the Washington Post Co. said weak advertising pushed
profits down 6 percent to $39 million. Even Gannett Co., where
earnings had grown nonstop for more than two decades, had only a
slight profit gain, from $74.9 million to $75 million. Gannett
revenue fell 1 percent to $813.4 million.
   Erburu made his remarks in the Times' new $230 million Olympic
Plant east of downtown, where state-of-the-art presses can churn
out a 96-page paper with 24 pages in full color. The Times also is
modernizing printing plants in Orange County and the San Fernando
Valley, spending $405 million in all.
   In an interview, Erburu said the company is looking for more
fresh ideas such as its partnership with KCAL-TV to produce
4{-minute Orange County news summaries to be inserted into CNN's
Headline News every half-hour. The summaries, drawing on stories
from Times reporters, will be shown by Times Mirror's cable company
in Orange County.

<HEAD>LA Times Becomes Largest Weekday Newspaper in the United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles Times surpassed the New York
Daily News as the U.S. metropolitan newspaper with the nation's
largest weekday circulation, according to preliminary figures
released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   The Times weekday circulation for the six months ending March 31
rose by 90,237 to 1,210,077, according to ABC figures released
April 30. The New York Daily News decreased in weekday circulation
over the period by 50,047, to 1,180,139.
   Two national-circulation newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and
USA Today, have larger weekday circulation figures than the Times,
1,935,866 and 1,387,233, respectively.
   The Times' Sunday circulation rose by 81,230, to 1,504,540,
making it second-largest in the nation behind the New York Times,
which has a Sunday circulation of 1,706,013.
   The weekend edition of USA Today, published Fridays, sold
1,753,537 copies a week.
   About half the Times' circulation growth stemmed from the demise
of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Times publisher David Laventhol
has said. The Herald Examiner had a circulation of roughly 230,000
when it closed in November.
   Perhaps up to 100,000 Herald Examiner subscribers already bought
a second newspaper, the ABC figures indicated. Of the remainder, an
estimated 50,000 to 70,000 may have stopped reading a daily
newspaper altogether, newspaper executives estimate.
   Of the rest, about two-thirds switched to the Los Angeles Times,
Laventhol has estimated. An additional 20,000 may have taken other
newspapers, particularly the Los Angeles Daily News.
   Daily News circulation rose by 19,044 on weekdays to 202,384,
and by 12,682 to 212,205 on Sundays.
   The Times quoted circulation experts as saying the Daily News
may have picked up about 10,000 former Herald Examiner readers.

<HEAD>Appellate Court Rejects Demand To Dissolve Freedom Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has rejected a
bid by Freedom Newspapers Inc. shareholder Harry Hoiles to dissolve
the $1 billion media group.
   The court, in a ruling made public May 1, upheld a 1987 decision
issued by Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein that found no
basis in Hoiles' claim that one-third of the family-operated
corporation illegally was undermined by the two-thirds majority.
   The lawsuit stems from Hoiles' claim that his sister, Mary Jane
Hoiles Hardie, promised to back him as the successor to Harry's
older brother Clarence, who headed Freedom until his death in 1981.
   But she refused to back him, and Harry Hoiles talked to
potential buyers for his shares, including the rival Times Mirror
Co.
   His sister and other family members offered to buy out his
shares at an offer that reflected a minority discount. Harry Hoiles
said the $125 million offer was insufficient.
   Concerned about a possible stock sale to competitors, the
majority shareholders adopted a stock restriction to give the
Hardies and the family of Clarence Hoiles the first chance to buy
each other's stock.
   Harry Hoiles also was not re-elected to a three-member executive
committee of Freedom.
   He sued, alleging the actions had denied him a fair price for
his stock and devalued it.
   But Goldstein ruled the majority stockholders had acted legally,
and the appellate court agreed.
   Fairness ``does not require the majority to submit to corporate
blackmail at the whim of a minority, any more than it will permit a
majority to take unfair advantage of a minority,'' wrote Associate
Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr.
   Harry Hoiles' lawyer, Kenneth Scholtz, said unless the appellate
court grants a rehearing, he will seek review before the state
Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Predict Daily News Demise Without New Equipment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders from the New York Daily News
brought their battle with the Tribune Co. to the media giant's
annual meeting May 3, predicting the newspaper would collapse in
six months unless its decaying printing plant is replaced.
   But company officials reiterated their commitment to first
bringing costs under control at the newspaper, once the nation's
largest metropolitan daily. That position is now held by the Los
Angeles Times.
   Also at the meeting, Tribune Co. head Stanton Cook announced he
will retire in August as chief executive officer and as publisher
of the Chicago Tribune.
   Cook told stockholders that 1989 was a record year, with
earnings of more than $242 million. But he said the company will
not pour money into the Daily News plant until ``excessive
operational costs'' are eliminated.
   ``It would not be prudent to recommend these investments until
costs are brought under control,'' said Cook. ``It would be a
mistake to underestimate our resolve. The advertisers deserve it,
and the shareholders deserve it.''
   George McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents 10 Daily News unions in contract negotiations with
the company, said corporate officials had it backwards. The unions
would make concessions, he said, but not until the Tribune Co.
agreed to substantial investments at what he called the
``Dickens-like'' plant.
   ``Unless the investments are made now, the News won't be around
in six months,'' McDonald said. ``Let's stop this charade and
settle this at the bargaining table.''
   Cook, who will be 65 in July, will remain chairman of the
Tribune Co. after he steps down as chief executive officer and
Tribune publisher.
   Charles Brumback, president and chief operating officer, will
become chief executive officer.
   John Madigan, president and chief executive officer of the
newspaper, will assume Cook's publishing duties.

<HEAD>Court Allows Jurors' Names To Remain Secret During Criminal Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on April 30 let stand a
ruling that says the public has no constitutional right to know the
names of jurors while they are serving in a criminal trial.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a Delaware
judge's order that kept jurors' names secret during a
much-publicized murder trial.
   Lawyers for Gannett Co., publisher of The News Journal in
Wilmington, said the judge's order contradicts previous Supreme
Court rulings on the public's right of access to criminal trials.
   The Delaware Supreme Court, saying those previous rulings do not
apply to the release of jurors' names, upheld the judge's order
last Nov. 13.
   ``Gannett has failed to carry its burden of establishing any
historical tradition of constitutional dimension regarding public
access to jurors' names,'' the state Supreme Court ruled.
   The dispute stemmed from the Wilmington murder trial of Steven
Pennell, who was charged with the serial torture slayings of three
women. State prosecutors sought the death penalty.
   Pennell was convicted of two of the murders and was sentenced to
life in prison.
   Before the trial's jury selection began, the presiding judge
ordered that potential jurors be identified in open court by
numbers, not their names. Throughout the trial, only the judge,
prosecutors, the defendant and his lawyers knew the jurors' names.
   The News Journal had published an article offering biographical
sketches of all the jurors in a then-recently concluded murder
trial, and the judge was concerned the newspaper might run a
similar article during Pennell's trial.
   Jurors were not to be sequestered, and the judge said he was
worried jurors might be harassed during the trial _ interfering in
Pennell's right to an impartial jury.
   Lawyers for Gannett noted that jurors had not been sequestered
in the previous trial, and that none was harassed after being
identified in the newspaper.
   But names of jurors in Pennell's case were not made public until
his trial ended.
   In a landmark 1980 ruling, the nation's highest court said the
public has a constitutional right to attend criminal trials even
when defendants object. The justices since have expanded that
ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial proceedings in criminal
cases.
   Judges cannot abridge that right, the court has said, without
articulating the compelling interests to be served by secrecy.
   In the appeal acted on April 30, lawyers for Gannett said, ``By
cloaking jurors in anonymity, the bond between the jury and the
public is weakened ... Hearing the name of each juror called and
relating that name to the juror's testimony (during jury selection)
insures public confidence that the process is fair and the answers
are truthful.''
   The Delaware Supreme Court rejected those arguments.
   ``Contrary to the rather pietistic claims of Gannett and (other
news organizations), there is nothing to suggest that such actions
undermined public trust in the judicial system,'' the state court
said.
   The case is Gannett vs. Delaware, 89-1324.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Reverses Himself; Las Vegas Data To Be Confidential</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has reversed
himself and will keep confidential the financial data of a
newspaper seeking approval of joint operations with a competitor in
Nevada, a spokesman said April 30.
   The attorney general signed an order reversing his decision of
Feb. 16 requiring the Las Vegas Review-Journal to disclose
circulation and advertising revenue, said spokesman David Runkel.
   The publisher of the newspaper, Donrey of Nevada Inc., an arm of
closely held Donrey Media Group, had sought reconsideration of the
February decision in a March 2 petition.
   Donrey argued that disclosure would damage relations with
customers, suppliers and unions not only in Las Vegas but in the 73
other markets in 21 states in which Donrey operates.
   In an agreement last June, the Review-Journal and the Las Vegas
Sun said they planned to merge their business, circulation and
production operations, keeping separate editorial departments,
along the lines of joint operating agreements in force in 19 other
cities.
   Such agreements are permitted if the attorney general finds that
one newspaper is in danger of failing. In Las Vegas, both
newspapers have said the Sun is in ``probable danger of financial
failure.''
   The data in question already has been submitted to the Justice
Department.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Inquirer Loses $34 Million Libel Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former city prosecutor won a record $34
million libel award May 3 from The Philadelphia Inquirer, but a
media lawyer and a reporters group said the judgment will likely be
overturned on appeal.
   The judgment was the largest ever awarded against the news
media, surpassing the $28 million a heart surgeon won last month
from a San Antonio television station, according to Henry Kaufman,
general counsel of the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York.
   Common Pleas Court jurors awarded $2.5 million in compensatory
damages and $31.5 million in punitive damages to attorney Richard
A. Sprague, a former first assistant district attorney.
   Sprague sued in 1983 over articles dating to 1973 in the
Inquirer, which has won 17 Pulitzer Prizes in 16 years, many for
investigative stories.
   ``I am a very strong advocate of First Amendment rights,'' said
James E. Beasley, attorney for Sprague. ``What I don't tolerate and
I don't think society should tolerate is the use of investigative
reporters or the power of the press for a personal vendetta. And
that is what developed here.''
   Sprague sued over stories questioning his actions and decisions
as a prosecutor.
   He contended that Greg Walter, one of the reporters involved in
the stories, had threatened to ``get and destroy'' Sprague, who had
prosecuted Walter in 1972 for taping a conversation without the
other person's knowledge.
   Walter has since died.
   Beasley said the jury's verdict, after deliberations of 2{ hours
at the end of the 11-week trial before Judge Charles P. Mirarchi
Jr., sent a message to investigative reporters ``not to destroy
somebody's reputation.''
   ``We will, of course, appeal,'' Eugene L. Roberts Jr., executive
editor and president of the newspaper, said in a statement. ``And I
am confident that however long it takes, the Inquirer will prevail.
   ``Most of our case never got to the jury. Thirteen witnesses
were eliminated by (Judge Mirarchi). And an investigative report by
the then state attorney general that supported the Inquirer story
was not allowed into evidence.''
   Sprague sued over articles that he said implied he was involved
in an illegal wiretapping incident, an allegation he denied, and
questioned his role in a homicide case involving a son of a friend,
former state police commissioner Rocco Urella. An eight-week trial
resulted in a $4.5 million verdict for Sprague in 1983.
   The state Supreme Court in June 1988 ordered a new trial,
declaring reporters have an absolute right to invoke the state
Shield Law in refusing to identify confidential sources during
legal proceedings.
   In the original trial, Judge Charles A. Lord ruled the law did
not apply in the case and excluded all testimony about information
from unidentified sources.
   ``It's unimaginable to me that a punitive damage award in this
amount could or would be upheld,'' said Floyd Abrams, a prominent
First Amendment lawyer. He represents NBC in appealing a $5.3
million libel judgment won by entertainer Wayne Newton.
   ``This is another example of libel law running amok,'' Abrams
said. ``I think that this case and others will sooner rather than
later lead the Supreme Court to address the constitutionality of
punitive damages in libel cases.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, sees a First Amendment issue in such awards.
   ``All a punitive damage award is when it's awarded against a
news organization is a fine for speaking,'' she said. ``But beyond
that ... it doesn't have to bear any relationship to anything.''

<HEAD>Weekly Newspaper Editor Arrested on Criminal Libel Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekly newspaper editor was arrested May
2 on two criminal libel charges after publishing a story about the
arrest of a high school principal.
   Editor-Publisher Drew Wilder of The Barnwell County Banner was
released on $2,000 bond.
   Wilder turned himself in after learning that the principal of
Wagener-Salley High School, Hammond Still, and his wife, Rhonda,
had sworn out warrants for his arrest, Sheriff Joey Zorn said.
   The Banner reported that Still was arrested April 6 on charges
of disorderly conduct and assault and battery stemming from a
domestic dispute with his wife, Rhonda, at South Carolina State
College in Orangeburg.
   Still claims he was never charged with assault and battery since
Mrs. Still never signed a warrant.
   Tim Moore, an attorney for the Stills, said the paper
erroneously published what was written in the Orangeburg County
Jail's booking report as a charge.
   ``In this case the police officer put on his booking report a
possible assault and battery and disorderly conduct,'' Moore said.
``He went back and (scratched) off on assault and battery and he
did charge him with public disorderly conduct.''
   Still was acquitted of the latter charge April 20.
   ``Five days after (Still) was acquitted, Mr. Wilder comes out
with his newspaper story and on the radio station saying he had
been charged with assault and battery and disorderly,'' the
attorney said. ``He also said the charge of assault and battery was
dropped. They hadn't been dropped; they had never been brought.''
   Wilder said, ``We stand by our story as being factual.''
   ``We do contend that he was charged,'' he added. ``Jailhouse
records show that. That's what he was arrested on.''
   The 4-year-old Banner, with a staff of five and a circulation of
5,000, reported the incident beginning with Still's arrest through
his acquittal, Wilder said. Wilder also broadcast the story on the
radio station he manages, WBAW AM-FM, which is owned by his father.
   The maximum penalty for criminal libel is a year in jail and a
$5,000 fine.

<HEAD>The Brownsville Herald Wins Counterclaim on Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A county commissioner and a former
candidate for sheriff were ordered to pay more than $25,000 to The
Brownsville Herald after a judge found no merit to libel suits they
filed against the newspaper.
   Cameron County Commissioner Lucino Rosenbaum Jr. was ordered to
pay $13,500, and Art Ramirez, a losing candidate for sheriff,
$12,357, in connection with libel suits they filed separately on
April 11, 1988.
   All but $5,000 from each man was to go to attorneys' fees and
court costs.
   Their cases were dismissed last year and the Herald countersued,
claiming the lawsuits were frivolous.
   Rosenbaum and Ramirez filed suit in connection with political
advertisements the newspaper ran when Rosenbaum was running for the
County Commission in 1988.
   The men, who also sued Rosenbaum's opponent, Ray Ramon, claimed
that the Herald and Ramon conspired to run a political ad in which
Ramirez endorsed Ramon for county commissioner.
   According to the lawsuits, the Herald published the ad while
knowing the information to be false.
   After the suits were dismissed, the newspaper filed and won the
counterclaim against Rosenbaum and Ramirez.
   State District Judge Robert F. Barnes said in his April 5 ruling
that the complaints were ``totally without merit.'' The judge said
that the newspaper was entitled to additional damages as sanctions.
   ``It's our intent to countersue for damages and attorney's fees
any time we're faced with this kind of legal action,'' said Doug
Hardie, Herald publisher.
   ``A large portion of those are frivolous lawsuits. A large
portion of those are politically motivated in an attempt to control
what newspapers and television stations report,'' he said.

   The jointly owned Fayetteville
Observer and the Fayetteville Times will merge into one morning
newspaper, Publisher Ramon L. Yarborough said.
   He said the merger will produce a newspaper that retains the
best features of the afternoon Observer and the morning Times. The

over 30,000.
   Yarborough said that Michael Rouse, managing editor of the
Observer, will be the executive editor of the combined paper. Tom
English, managing editor of the Times, was asked to become managing
editor of the new product but declined. Michael Arnholt, features
editor of the two newspapers, will be promoted to managing editor

<HEAD>Division of Teamsters Recommends Support of Newspaper Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamsters newspaper division leaders
approved a resolution May 2 asking the international union to
support drivers and other employees of the New York Daily News, who
have been without a contract since the end of March.
   The vote came after Michael J. Alvino, president of the
Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union, one of 10 within the Allied
Printing Trades Council, told Teamsters the council was in the
front lines of a struggle to break organized labor in the nation's
largest, most-unionized city.
   ``If the News beats the printing unions, then every other union
... whatever they deliver, whatever it is, they will be taken on by
their employers,'' Alvino said.
   John P. Kennedy, president of the Pressmen's union, another
Allied affiliate, said union-busting tactics perfected in smaller
cities since the 1960s were being tried in New York.
   ``This is going to be seen all over the country, and we're going
to stop them,'' he said.
   Alvino denied a strike was imminent if the Washington-based
Teamsters sided with the New York unions. He said his attorney was
studying the paper's latest offer _ a three-year contract with wage
increases of 5 percent the first year and 4 percent in each
successive year.
   However, Alvino said the offer _ based on the current $20.38 an
hour for a 35-hour week _ was a veiled attempt to destroy his
98-year-old union and added that a counterproposal was likely.
   The Daily News also seeks management-rights and no-strike
clauses and the exclusion of all side agreements not included in
the new contract. It says it must be able to weed out
featherbedding in the pressmen's and drivers' unions in order to
turn a profit.
   The offer was revealed May 1. The drivers are to respond at a
May 14 bargaining session.

   News Publishing Co., whch owns the Rome News-Tribune, filed the

   According to the suit, the current grand jury has had a special

   The weekly Calhoun Chronicle was
ordered to publish a paid political advertisement urging defeat of
a $5.3 million school bond issue it had supported.
   The newspaper had earlier rejected the ad. Judge Charles McCarty
ordered it published May 3 because that was the last edition before
a May 8 vote on the bond issue.
   The case stemmed from an appeal by Citizen Awareness Regarding
Education, which opposed the bond issue designed to raise funds for
a combined middle school-high school.
   Carl Morris, the paper's owner, refused to accept the ad on
March 30, saying supporters of the bond issue would not have time
to respond to it. The Chronicle had previously published two of the
group's ads.
   The judge's ruling said, ``By refusing to publish the
advertisement, the Calhoun Chronicle is depriving the plaintiff of
the only legitimate forum available to reach citizens of the
county.''
   ``I see this as a critical assertion of the essential right of
free speech,'' said Loren B. Howley, an attorney for the bond issue
opponents. ``If there were a competing newspaper, it would be a
different situation.''
   Bill Childress, executive director of the West Virginia Press
Association, said the ruling disregarded the First Amendment.
   ``The judge made a serious error in departing from what has been
the standard legal position that a newspaper has the right to
refuse any advertising it chooses to refuse, political or
non-political,'' Childress said.

present. The commission has three members.
   John Hildreth, director of the Southwest Regional Office of
Consumers Union, said the decision ``reaffirms the fundamental
concept of openness in Texas government.''
   ``The Supreme Court remedied a decision which would have slammed
the door on access to decision making by major regulatory
agencies,'' Hildreth said.
   Nancy Monson, executive director of the Freedom of Information
Foundation of Texas, hailed the ruling as ``an excellent decision.''
   ``We're really grateful that the Supreme Court upheld the
people's right to know,'' she said.
   The ruling was made in a lawsuit filed by Charles Acker in
Travis County state district court.
   Acker was appearing before the Water Commission in 1986 seeking
a waste water treatment plant permit to provide service to
residents of his mobile home park in Huntsville. The hearing
examiner recommended the commission grant Acker the permit.
   During a break in the meeting, Acker's lawyer, Andrew Taylor,
said he overheard commission members discussing the application in
the restroom.
   When the meeting reconvened, one of the commissioners voted to
grant the application. The remaining two commissioners voted to
deny it.
   Acker won his case in a state district court summary judgment,
but the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals overturned the decision
in May 1989.

<HEAD>Keep Hostage Journalist's Story Alive, Colleague Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keeping alive the story of Terry Anderson is
crucial to winning the release of the captive Associated Press
reporter, a colleague of Anderson said.
   ``While I think there is a lot of support out there, there has
to be more support,'' Time magazine photographer Bill Foley said in
accepting an award for Anderson, the longest-held of the Western
hostages.
   ``And there has to be more of a message given to Washington that
people out there do care, and that to get this over with, you're
going to have to talk with people, and talking with people, we will
see these men free,'' Foley added. ``They're not going to just
appear one day because somebody said, `Oh, this is terrible. We
must release these guys.' ''
   Foley, a former AP photographer, made his remarks while
accepting the Mitchell V. Charnley Award on Anderson's behalf April
28 at the annual meeting of the Northwest Broadcast News
Association.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for the AP, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. He was cited by the NBNA for his
``outstanding contributions to the field of broadcast journalism.''
   The Charnley Award is given annually to a journalist with
Midwestern ties who has distinguished himself in the broadcast
industry. Anderson spent three years as a radio and television
reporter at KRNT and KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa, before joining
The AP in Detroit in May 1974.
   The award, established in 1968, is named for Mitchell V.
Charnley, professor emeritus from the University of Minnesota
School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Charnley taught at the
university from 1934 to 1968 and was a founder of the NBNA.
   Chartered in 1949, the NBNA includes broadcast professionals and
students in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota
and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Newspaper's Gun Photograph Denounced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders have denounced a front-page
photograph in The Boston Sunday Globe, saying it is racist and
glorifies guns.
   The photograph in the April 29 newspaper, which accompanied an
article on the widespread availability of guns, showed a black man
with his athletic shirt pulled up to reveal a gun in his belt. The
caption said the man identified himself as a drug dealer.
   State Sen. Bill Owens, D-Boston, said the Globe's photograph was
exploitive and showed black youths in a negative light. He also
said it seemed to have been staged for the photographer.
   ``The question that comes to my mind is, when do you begin to
make news and when do you begin to sell it,'' he said.
   Owens said the photograph could fuel violence in the city:
``Suppose this person is a gang member. Another gang member will
try to outdo that person.''
   Globe Editor John S. Driscoll said in a prepared statement: ``We
understand their concerns. Our intent was not to depict a
particular person but to reflect the issue explained in the story.''
   Rep. Shirley Owens-Hicks, D-Boston, said the photograph made
dealing drugs look ``cool.''
   ``The article had a lot of good information,'' she added. ``But
a picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words. This picture is
worth a thousand words to gang members. This says it is all right
to carry a gun, in that you'll get acknowledgment in the newspaper
for it.''
   Bill Owens also said the story ``had a lot of truth.'' But, he
said, a better accompanying photograph might have been taken of
money-laundering in the city's financial district of ``white-collar
guys counting the money that they have made off the black
community.''

<HEAD>Arrest Made in Tijuana Columnist's Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sought in the slaying of popular
journalist Hector ``Gato'' Felix is in custody in Tijuana, Baja
California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel announced May 1.
   Antonio Vera Palestina, former head of security at Agua Caliente
racetrack in Tijuana, is one of two men accused in the killing of
Felix, 47, who was gunned down April 20, 1988, as he drove to work.
   Ruffo said in a statement that Vera was returned to Tijuana from
Southern California, where he was taken into custody by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies for allegedly being in the United States
illegally.
   Victoriano Medina Moreno, a former guard at the racetrack, was
sentenced last year to 27 years to life in prison for the murder of
Felix.
   The journalist was co-editor of Zeta, a muckraking weekly
tabloid. He died after being shot twice at close range with a
12-gauge shotgun.
   Co-Editor Jesus Blancornelas has charged repeatedly in the
newspaper that although Vera may have been the triggerman, as
authorities believe, investigators still must seek the
``intellectual author'' of the crime.
   Felix regularly lampooned Tijuana's elite in his gossip column,
``A Bit of Something.'' He was especially hard on Agua Caliente
racetrack owner Jorge Hank Rhon, 35, in the weeks before his death.
   Rhon repeatedly and vehemently has denied any involvement,
saying he had no reason to seek Felix's death.

<HEAD>Flood of Anonymous Claims Leads to Caution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a flood of phone calls and
facsimile messages claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks,
Colombia's news media are beginning to ignore the messages.
   The reason is simple _ it is impossible to tell who is really on
the other end of the line. Drug traffickers? Police posing as drug
traffickers? Leftist guerrillas? Pranskters?
   Until a few weeks ago, virtually all of Colombia's radio
stations and newspapers used the statements without question. No
one pointed out the information came from anonymous people and
could not be verified.
   Recently, the country's two leading newspapers, Bogota's El
Espectador and El Tiempo, chose not to publish news about some of
the anonymous messages.
   An example of the confusion came after leftist presidential
candidate Carlos Pizarro was killed April 26 by an assassin on a
Colombian airliner.
   Within two hours, the anonymous telephone calls started.
   It was the Medellin cartel, one man said. Another president
would be assassinated, he said.
   The next day brought another facsimile message, also supposedly
from the Medellin cartel, to a Bogota radio station, Caracol.
   It wasn't us, the supposed cartel communique said. It accused
the police of killing people and setting off bombs so that the
cartel would be blamed.
   Another example came after a truck bomb in Medellin killed 20
people on April 11.
   Facsimile statements under the letterhead of the Extraditables,
a name assumed by leaders of the Medellin cartel, said the cartel
was not responsibile.
   Recently there have been facsimile and telephone messages from
anonymous people claiming to speak for the cartel, saying those
statements directly after the April 11 bombing were fakes.
   ``Somebody has been using us as their public relations office,''
a senior editor at a Bogota newspaper said April 28.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose campaign against talk
show host Geraldo Rivera gathered support from some advertisers is
asking the government to take action against a station that runs
the show.
   Lynda Beams has asked the Federal Communications Commission to
admonish KDFW-TV for broadcasting ``indecent'' programming during
after-school hours.
   Mrs. Beams earned national attention when she persuaded some
advertisers to pull their spots from the ``Geraldo'' talk show.
   She now claims that by airing ``Geraldo'' at 4 p.m. KDFW is
violating FCC guidelines requiring that programming that panders to
vulgar tastes not be aired before 8 p.m.
   The station has agreed to change ``Geraldo'' from its 4 p.m.
time slot when the show's contract expires Sept. 1.
   Station manager Jeff Rosser sounded exasperated in discussing
Mrs. Beams' drive.
   ``Enough's enough. I keep expecting Lynda Beams to claim
victory,'' Rosser said. ``I am unaware of any brief she's filed,
and I am a little bit surprised. But it's America and she's
entitled.''
   Rosser said that ``Geraldo,'' which is aired after school in
about 130 markets, has toned down its topics since December. He
said there has been a backlash of viewers who accuse the station of
caving in to the assault by Mrs. Beams.

correspondent-columnist Bill Lambrecht won the 46th annual Raymond
Clapper Memorial Award on March 28 for a series on the export of
U.S. garbage.
   Knight-Ridder Newspapers correspondent Christopher Scanlan was
named winner of the Barnet Nover Memorial Award for a series on the
effect of the budget crisis on government health care for veterans.
   The awards, which recognize excellence in reporting, were made
by the Raymond Clapper Foundation and the Barnet Nover Foundation
and were presented at the annual White House Correspondents
Association dinner.
   Each also carried a $1,500 cash prize. Second place carried a
$500 prize.
   John Hall of Media General was named the second-place Clapper
winner for his series on the Navy's investigation of the explosion
on the battleship Iowa.
   Andrew Melnykovych of the Casper Star-Tribune was named the
second-place Nover winner for his series on federal oil and gas
royalty audits and the nomination of James Cason to be assistant
secretary of agriculture.
   The Clapper winners were selected from among 33 entries

Raymond Clapper, a Washington correspondent and columnist for
Scripps Howard Newspapers, was killed in an airplane crash while
covering the invasion of the Marshall Islands in World War II.
   The Clapper award was established in 1944 to recognize a
Washington-based newspaper writer whose work ``most clearly
approximated the ideals of fair and painstaking reporting and good
craftsmanship that were characteristic of Raymond Clapper.''
   The Nover winners were selected from 24 entries submitted to a

<HEAD>Young Women Lead Japanese into Free-spending Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The transformation of Japan in two generations is
embodied in Kimiko Omori, who scratched a living from the ruins of
war, and her granddaughter, a child of prosperity who spends every
yen she earns.
   Mrs. Omori, 70, was the privileged daughter of a prosperous
restaurant owner. World War II changed everything.
   In 1950, in a devastated city, she became a kimono tailor. Hard
work and prudence have left her comfortably fixed, but she gives
her extra money to her children's families rather than treating
herself to an afternoon of Kabuki theater or a trip abroad.
   Norie Omori, 22, lives in a world alien to her grandmother's
experience.
   She is an unskilled office assistant at a Japanese securities
firm, lives at home and earns the equivalent of about $640 a month
after taxes. She gives $190 to her parents and spends the other
$450 on clothes, cosmetics, eating out and skiing.
   Her grandmother doesn't think Norie is spoiled, but still, she
shakes her head and says, ``Society has really changed.''
   More and more, the pursuit of work yields to chasing pleasure,
especially among the young.
   Many in Japan's working population still lead frugal lives,
weighed down by high schooling costs and mortgages on houses priced
at more than five times their annual incomes. Surveys show the
average Japanese spends about half as much time on leisure pursuits
as an American.
   The young, single woman has become Japan's big spender, and is a
major target of those with something appropriate to sell.
   Like Norie Omori, she lives with her parents, pays little or
nothing toward living expenses and has an office job she plans to
hold only until marriage.
   With plenty of time and disposable income, she propels the
fashion industry nearly $56.2 billion, travel industry $18.7
billion and publishing industry $13 billion.
   She travels with other young women to Hawaii and Australia,
devours novels and magazines, buys the world's leading brand-name
shoes, bags and perfumes, and goes to trendy restaurants.
   Her gifts for birthdays and Valentine's Day are generous and she
spends thousands of dollars a year on golf or health club fees,
according to a profile by Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising and
marketing agency.
   Tokyo Disneyland, Japan's premier amusement park, overflows with
young women. Female visitors to the park outnumbered males nearly
2-to-1 last year.
   ``Young adult females are the core of our repeat customers,''
said Disneyland spokesman Toshiharu Akiba. ``Leisure is here to
stay. Unlike their parents, the younger generation knows the joy of
taking holidays, and they have the knowledge, time and the money to
spend.''
   Of the 9 million Japanese who traveled abroad in 1989, about
780,000 were women aged 20 to 24. Men in the same age group,
ambitious and less eager to take vacations, numbered only 430,000.
   In a magazine survey, 100 young women with office jobs in Tokyo
said they spent an average of $554 a month on clothing, food and
drink, athletics, language lessons and other non-essentials.
   They reported spending 13.5 hours a week on leisure activities,
according to the May issue of Travail, a job-placement magazine for
women.
   Japan became an economic powerhouse partly because of its
people's sacrifices. Many Japanese who grew up with long work
weeks, cramped houses and sky-high prices are bent on raising their
standard of living.
   This follows the new national path desired by Japan's trading
partners, who urge the Japanese to play and buy more as a way of
reducing a $70 billion annual trade surplus with the world.

<HEAD>Comedian Creates Stand-Up Comedy for the Deaf</HEAD>

   John Golub was selling used cars by day and
playing comedy clubs by night when he mixed the two: While selling
a car to a deaf woman, he slipped a joke into the written notes
they were exchanging.
   She laughed.
   ``It just struck me right there that wouldn't it be great to
make comedy accessible to deaf people,'' he said.
   Since that moment 10 years ago, Golub has sworn off the car
trade. But he hasn't given up on comedy, and he hasn't given up on
trying to reach people who can't hear the punchline.
   Golub has developed an act using a sign language interpreter and
an infrared amplification device, and has brought hundreds of
hearing-impaired people into comedy clubs for the first time.
   His shows are ``bringing people into the mainstream of
recreation,'' said Ruth Green, head of the New York League for the
Hard of Hearing. ``Comedy club owners never really realized there
was an audience they were missing.''
   Green's organization has supported Golub's efforts since he
moved from Los Angeles six years ago. With the league's
cooperation, he organized comedy benefit shows every year since in
1985. This year, there are four.
   Golub is 32, squarely built and energetic. He has a personal
stake in the welfare of the deaf; he has two sisters who cannot
hear.
   He tries to avoid making changes in his act to accommodate the
deaf. His intention, he says, is not to develop two different
audiences, but rather to integrate the deaf into the hearing
audience.
   ``When I do these shows, I want it to be a show that anyone can
enjoy, deaf or hearing.''
   Still, some jokes don't translate well to the deaf, and
interpreter Mara Zuckerman _ who has worked with Golub at every
benefit _ says she sometimes has to explain this to the comedians.
   Jokes about popular culture from television or radio often do
not work. One performer parodied the theme song from the television
show ``Rawhide.'' But the act would bomb with a deaf audience
because few deaf people have ever watched the show or heard the
theme music.
   Puns and rhymes don't work with the deaf. Nor do impressions.
``They're not going to know something sounds like Cary Grant,''
Zuckerman says.
   But visual humor _ mime and physical impersonations, such as a
funny walk or a parody of a famous rock musician _ often works.
Dirty jokes also get laughs, she says: ``Most sexually related
signs are very graphic, so both the deaf audience and the hearing
audience get a kick out of that.''
   At a recent benefit in Stamford, Conn., one comic asked an
embarrassed couple in the audience whether they had ``done it yet.''
   ``Oh, I'm sorry,'' he quickly apologized. ``It's none of my
business, but I was just interested in seeing how Mara signed that
one.''
   That Zuckerman _ despite her protests _ often serves as the
comedians' foil is an indication of the importance of the
interpreter.
   Standing off to the side of the small stage during a recent
benefit show, the black-clad Zuckerman interpreted for the night's
three comics and gave quite a performance herself. Even though she
moved her feet little, she used a wide range of facial expressions
and body movements to convey humor.
   Always just a fraction of a second behind the comic, she
gestured quickly with her hands and arms as she translated the
jokes.
   Still, Zuckerman stays as close as possible to the traditional
role of interpreter, despite comedy's non-traditional demands.
   ``If a comic is going to get up there and be bawdy, I'm not
there to change his act to make it more palatable to the audience
or funnier or less funny,'' she said. ``If he's going to bomb, then
I'm going to let him bomb.''
   But sometimes, she joins in the fun. At the start of one show,
Golub jumped on stage and quickly announced, ``I'm going to talk
really fast''; Zuckerman reacted by glaring at Golub, and the two
stared at each other for seconds.
   The interpreters serve some of the hard of hearing; others
listen to what is being said with the aid of the infrared system.
   Often found in theaters, auditoriums and churches, the system
converts the electrical signal from the microphone into infrared
light. This light is then transmitted throughout the club;
hard-of-hearing members of the audience wear wireless headsets that
pick up the signal and amplify it.
   Golub's shows have not all been sellouts, but the League for the
Hard of Hearing deems them a success.
   Golub envisions a national comedy tour to benefit the hard of
hearing. He has a dream of making comedy accessible to all deaf
people in the United States.
   ``Who am I?'' he said. ``I'm nobody. ... But I think I can have
an effect as a nobody.''

   Today is Saturday, May 19, the 139th day of 1990. There are 226
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery. (Anne
had fallen from Henry's favor because their marriage did not result
in any male heirs; however, she did give birth to a daughter, who
later became Queen Elizabeth I.)
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and
part of Canada in the early afternoon. The cause has never been
determined.
   In 1906, the Federated Boys' Clubs, forerunner of the Boys'
Clubs of America, were organized.
   In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, which
established national quotas for immigrants entering the U.S.
   In 1926, inventor Thomas Edison was called upon to speak on
radio during the dinner of the National Electric Light Association
in Atlantic City, N.J. (Faced with the microphone, Edison said:
``Why, I don't know what to say. This is the first time I ever
spoke into one of these things. Good night.'')
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
died in England following a motorcycle crash.
   In 1943, in an address to the U.S. Congress, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in
the war against Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: Angry homeowners at Love Canal in Niagara Falls,
   N.Y., detained two Environmental Protection Agency officials for
nearly five hours, demanding the federal government evacuate the
neighborhood because of toxic chemical contamination.
   Five years ago: Residents of the Philadelphia neighborhood
ravaged by fire in a police confrontation with the radical group
``MOVE'' gathered for Sunday services to seek solace.
   One year ago: The NCAA announced sanctions against the
University of Kentucky's basketball program for recruiting and
academic violations. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average passed the 2,500 mark, ending the day at 2,501.10.
   Today's Birthdays: PBS newscaster Jim Lehrer is 56. TV
   personality David Hartman is 55. Author Nora Ephron is 49. Rock
singer-composer Peter Townshend is 45. Singer-actress-model Grace
Jones is 38. Singer Joey Ramone is 38. Baseball catcher Rick Cerone
is 36.
   Thought for Today: ``If every nation gets the government it
   deserves, every generation writes the history which corresponds
with its view of the world.'' -- Elizabeth Janeway, American author.

<TEXT>
   Bill Seidman can be a hard man to get along
with, but the White House may find he's even harder to get along
without.
   Seidman has been both a leading man and a lightning rod in the
savings and loan bailout. While his policy dissents have made the
administration uncomfortable, his role provided political
insulation. President Bush will lose that when Seidman leaves,
probably in the fall.
   There'll be no argument over the credentials of William Taylor,
the Federal Reserve Board's bank supervisor, to take over Seidman's
dual role as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Resolution Trust Corp. And he is likely to prove as independent
as Seidman.
   But Taylor will be a lot quieter about it.
   Seidman _ L. William is the name on the letterhead _ is out
front, outspoken, a very public public figure.
   That's made him a popular man in Congress and with the news
media, and an irksome one to some people in the administration,
among them the high command at the Treasury and White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu.
   Seidman, now 69, was appointed to the FDIC post by President
Reagan for a term that runs until October 1991, and the franchise
was expanded when Congress passed the savings and loan bailout bill
last year. The FDIC now insures both bank and savings and loan
depositors, and the Resolution Trust Corp. sells the assets of
failing S&amp;Ls closed by the government.
   The chairman is appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate for a six-year term. Once he's there, he's independent; the
president can't oust him.
   But there are ways. Seidman had said he planned to leave before
his term was up, and hoped he could do so after getting the S&amp;L
rescue effort off to a good beginning. He also had sounded alarms
about rising costs, complained about bureaucratic delays in the
bailout, and dismissed some administration suggestions, sometimes
with a wisecrack.
   And so there appeared in The Washington Post on May Day a report
that Seidman had met with Bush in mid-April, had said he wasn't
going to complete his full term, and had been encouraged to end it
sooner rather than later.
   From that point, the script was predictable. When a president
wants somebody to leave the government, it is customary that he
praises the man's performance and says that he respects the
fellow's wish to move on.
   Seidman knows the way it works. He's been around Republican
politics for more than 30 years and he served in the White House as
an economic aide to President Ford.
   ``Bill has indicated that he's not going to stay the whole term,
and we are interested in getting new leadership there that will
carry out an aggressive program when the time comes,'' White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   That stirred Democratic congressional demands that Bush push
Seidman to stay, for his credibility and demonstrable independence
as the chairman of a bailout in which estimated costs are soaring.
   ``You do not solve these problems by shooting the messenger,''
said Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn., who heads a House task force on
the RTC.
   ``Hey, listen,'' Bush countered, ``If all the people that
brought bad news in here were asked to do something else, it would
be a little lonely.''
   Bush said Seidman had done a good job, with grace and ability,
and had made his own decision to leave. ``And he also said, `Look,
I understand if you might want to put your own person in there,'''
the president said Thursday. ``It's his initiative with me, and
today he suggested the name of a Bill Taylor who we're very high on
to take over.''
   The president inherited the savings and loan crisis and made the
rescue bailout bill one of his earliest priorities. The initial
cost estimate was $257 billion; that's now up to at least $325
billion and probably more. The General Accounting Office says the
price could be $500 billion over 30 years.
   That's too costly not to become a political issue at some point.
That may be hastened by Seidman's departure. It's an inherited
mess, and both parties collaborated in letting it happen. But Bush
is in charge now, and when his nominee takes over as the central
figure in the bailout, his administration will have full custody of
a no-win process.
   ``Don't be impatient,'' Seidman told a House hearing on Friday.
``This is a long, hard job. It isn't going to be accomplished any
time soon.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The idea is to collect unmarketable food from
supermarkets and distribute it to the needy. The supermarket gets a
tax break and hungry people get something to eat. The concept has
generated a network of food banks that last year distributed $846
million worth of food. But some wonder if this is a solution or
part of the problem.

   A woman scavenging in a supermarket's garbage to feed her 10
children gave Phoenix soup kitchen volunteers the idea. Why not
gather wasted food and make it available to people who need it?
   ``It was meant to be just a little emergency program taking
pressure off social workers,'' says John van Hengel, who founded
the nation's first food bank in Phoenix in 1967.
   Today, that ``little emergency program'' is a network of 200
food banks linked by Second Harvest, an 11-year-old organization
second only to the government in providing food to the needy.
   Last year, Second Harvest food banks distributed 419 million
pounds of food and other products worth roughly $846 million to
39,700 soup kitchens, food pantries, and other non-profit programs.
   There are food banks independent of this network, but Philip R.
Warth Jr., Second Harvest president and chief executive officer,
says almost all ``legitimate'' food banks are affiliated.
   ``If you're a Second Harvest food bank, it's as if you've got
the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,'' says Catherine D'Amato,
executive director of the Western Massachusetts Food Bank.
   In some segments of the hunger community, however, there is
concern. Pointing to Second Harvest's dominance and its ties to the
food industry, which provides board members and financial support
as well as food, some food bankers and activists wonder whom the
network really serves, the hungry or the donors.
   ``When somebody says we're leaning more toward the industry,
well, heck. It's their food,'' Warth says. ``If we can't make it
work from the industry's standpoint, we sure can't make it work
from the food bank's standpoint.''
   Reducing waste by distributing food in an efficient,
cost-effective way fulfills the mandate of food banking, he says.
``We are not an anti-hunger organization. We are a service
provider, helping people who fall through the cracks.''
   Some critics, however, contend that some of its promotional
materials suggest otherwise. They cite, for example, a direct-mail
brochure soliciting donations headlined ``Hunger in America,
Solutions From Second Harvest.''
   Food banks are ``simply a mechanism to warehouse and distribute
unmarketable food,'' says Christina Walker, a former board member
of Food for Survival, a New York food bank.
   ``There's nothing wrong with that. It's in promoting food banks
as an effective and cost-efficient remedy to poverty and hunger
that a major problem arises.''
   Warth says the brochure is accurate. ``We feel that we are a
solution to the symptom of hunger.'' At the same time, Second
Harvest is ``awfully quick to say to the public as well as to
Congress that we do not hold ourselves up as having the role, the
responsibility or the wherewithal to eliminate hunger in America.''
   Further stirring controversy about whom Second Harvest serves is
the questionable nutritional value of some donations, and the fact
that roughly a fifth of its ``product'' isn't food at all.
   ``It's cleaning fluid and detergent and hand lotion. It's the
way every business in America unloads stuff that isn't moving in
the stores,'' says Nancy Amidei, former executive director of the
Washington, D.C., Food Research and Action Center, the leading
research and advocacy group on hunger.
   Warth says Second Harvest ``was founded on the notion of
surplus. ... almost anything being produced by the industry would
be of some use to the individuals and charities being served.''
   The Toledo@Northwest Ohio Food Bank's inventory recently
included salad dressing, cake mixes, bread crumbs, frozen pizza,
apple butter, cereals, mint sauce, tostada shells, flour, crackers,
pie crust mix, muffin mix, soda, chocolate milk, butter pats,
pasta, sausage, cheese, frozen potatoes, zucchini and carrots.
   It also listed calendars, home permanent kits, soap, cold
medicines, aspirin, bandages, copper cleaner, shoes, socks, toys,
underwear, T-shirts, laundry detergent and Christmas ornaments.
   Bill Bolling, executive director of the Atlanta Food Bank,
points out that food stamps can only be used to buy food.
``Whenever we can get good non-food items, agencies need that,'' he
says.
   Catherine D'Amato agrees, to a point. ``Diapers are extremely
useful. Wallpaper? No.''
   Warth says such products of marginal value account for a
relatively small percentage. While Second Harvest makes a concerted
effort to capture nutritious foods, the nature of food banking is
such that ``we'll never get as much food as we want, and we'll
always be reactive.''
   Food distributed by Second Harvest food banks ``probably amounts
to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all the food produced in
this country,'' Warth says. Compared with federal food programs, he
says, Second Harvest accounts for about 1{ percent of all food
assistance in the nation.
   Even that 1{ percent, however, makes Second Harvest the nation's
second-largest provider of food to the needy.
   And to J. Larry Brown, chairman of the Physician Task Force on
Hunger in America and a leading critic, the issue isn't the amount
of food, it's ``the perception by government that it can use Second
Harvest as a key player. Any number of members of Congress who
don't want to expand food programs point to the private system as a
major player.''
   Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., the ranking Republican on the House
Select Committee on Hunger, supports legislation calling for an
additional $2.3 billion for food programs over the next three years.
   At the same time, ``I absolutely do see Second Harvest as a
major player,'' says Emerson, who wants some of that money used to
buy surplus commodities to be distributed by food banks and other
private agencies.

   While bringing hunger to the public's attention is part of
Second Harvest's mission, Warth says, ``we are not about providing
systemic change. That has got to come from elsewhere in our
society.''
   In fact, Second Harvest largely stays out of politics, he says.
``If we grind too many political axes one way or another we're
going to lose the credibility of the people we work with.''
   Brown contends that with prominence and prosperity come
responsibility. ``With the network and money they raise, they have
an ethical obligation to speak to the root causes of hunger.''
   At its downtown Chicago headquarters, the white walls, gray
carpets and green plants set a sleek, corporate tone that mirrors
the image Second Harvest presents to the food industry.
   One reason for its success has been a system that makes it easy
to donate and that emphasizes cleanliness, efficiency and quality
control, critical issues to the food industry, which puts a premium
on brand protection and meticulous product-handling.
   In most cases, a single phone call by a manufacturer or retailer
sets the system in motion. One of Second Harvest's 30 Chicago staff
members determines the nature and location of the donation, then
relays the information to one of three regional offices. The
product is then allocated to specific food banks, which assume
responsibility for transporting it.
   Of the 419 million pounds of food distributed to agencies last
year, 172 million pounds was donated by way of this national
network. The rest was donated to food banks locally.
   Food companies are entitled to a tax deduction equal to the cost
of producing the goods plus half the unrealized profits, adjusted
for damage and reduced shelf life. The value to the food industry
has never been calculated.
   Warth calls it ``consequential but not compelling,'' but says
it's not typically lucrative for companies to donate food.
   In a 1989 survey, 85 percent of food industry representatives
queried said the tax break was an important factor in their
decision to donate food.
   Warth says Second Harvest is organized along corporate lines
because it's the most efficient way to do business. ``My board has
made it clear that my job is to make this organization as efficient
and effective as possible.''
   If that sends a reassuring message to private industry, it also
makes some food bankers uncomfortable.
   ``There's a bunch of corporate people in there with a bunch of
degrees that do not belong in food banking. They have no idea what
the concept is,'' says Lori Waggoner, office manager at the
Toledo-Northwest Ohio Food Bank.
   ``The institution has become insensitive. They've lost touch
with the way the rest of us worship in this religion,'' says Tom
Ferraro, executive director of the Genesee Valley Regional Food
Clearinghouse, a Second Harvest food bank in Rochester, N.Y.
   ``I'm not necessarily anti-white glove sanitation inspections or
paperwork. That's needed to be accountable and responsible not only
for taking corporate donations, but also for handling food that
we're giving people to eat,'' Ferraro says.
   He's more bothered by a ``a kind of media slickness'' in Second
Harvest's marketing in recent years.
   Warth says marketing ``makes us successful, just like anybody
else. If you can't market yourself, you can't be successful. It's a
fact of life that we're in a very competitive environment.''
   But Ferraro says marketing efforts have gone too far. ``I'm not
100 percent opposed to packaging; some of it's necessary. But this
is too much. I don't know if decisions are made on the basis of
what's right and ethical, or if they're based on what some poll
said would be best for public perception.''
   At the same time, Ferraro acknowledges that for many food
bankers, Second Harvest is a convenient scapegoat.
   Though food banks weren't designed to meet long-term nutritional
needs, rising housing costs and shrinking public programs have
forced many Americans to rely on donated food.
   Like many food banks, D'Amato's now buys high-protein foods such
as peanut butter, chicken and beef to supplement the kinds of items
that are most often donated: chips, cookies, cereal, juice and ice
cream. It also grows food and makes vegetarian chili.
   Distributing more nutritious food is one way for food banks to
better serve their communities, says Marc A. Thibodeau, a former
Boston Food Bank board member. Zeroing in on high-risk populations
_ pregnant women, infants, young children and old people _ is
another.
   ``I think of hunger as largely a medical problem with severe
medical ramifications, but food banking doesn't run programs
designed to address that,'' Thibodeau says.
   ``If volunteers are going to bother to go to all this trouble,
they should move beyond Second Harvest's rather myopic goal of
eliminating food waste and try to have the private sector fill in
gaps where government doesn't reach.''
   Ferraro is among those searching for ways to broaden food
banking's mission. He's using his Rochester food bank's warehouse
to teach job skills to four disadvantaged teen-agers.
   The four-month program, designed with help from local food
companies, covers shipping, receiving, sanitation, equipment and
computer skills. Graduates will go to work for participating
companies, and a new group of teen-agers will begin training.
   ``I think there's a real obligation that comes with having
tax-exempt status. It means we should do some of the hard things.
   ``Doing outreach and advocacy as well as food banking makes us
more of a comprehensive hunger-fighter,'' Ferraro says. ``Adding
employment and training really puts the emphasis on systemic root
causes, and not just on throwing dented cans at the symptoms.''

   Each Wednesday morning, a crowd gathers in a
parking lot on the southwest corner of Toledo, outside the basement
of Our Lady of Lourdes.
   As the church doors open, Bob and Ginny Pacholski assume their
posts behind the soup kitchen serving counter, just as they have
every Wednesday for eight years.
   ``We thought we'd do this for two or three years at the most,
until the recession ended,'' says Pacholski, who opened his
Hospitality Kitchen in 1982.
   Now, though, there's no end in sight.
   Roughly 600 men, women and children make their way through the
food line every week, so many that the Pacholskis must assign them
all numbers and serve them in shifts. The overflow crowd stands
patiently outside the door, waiting to be called over the
microphone Bob uses to keep things moving.
   The long cafeteria tables are packed, and the traffic between
serving line, tables and door is heavy. The majority of clients are
single men, old women and mothers with young children, although a
number of two-parent families are here, too.
   ``We treat people with dignity,'' says Pacholski. A retired real
estate agent, he's tanned and fit-looking with kindly blue eyes
that continually sweep the tables searching for empty seats.
   Clinking flatware, scraping chairs and the muffled roar of
dozens of conversations fill the room. Once the schools let out in
June, the number of children will skyrocket, and noise levels will
increase appreciably.
   Like most soup kitchens, the Pacholskis' does not require its
clients to show identification. Those receiving the boxes of
federal surplus commodities being dispensed at the far end of the
room are required to prove need, with unemployment compensation
cards or other such documentation.
   ``It used to be all general relief or AFDC (Aid to Families With
Dependent Children). Now, we're seeing people unemployed, people
laid off,'' Pacholski says.
   ``The first week we opened, we had 23 people. By that August, we
had 1,013.'' Lately, in a typical month, the kitchen serves 2,400
people, although the numbers are once again going up.
   Today's menu includes barbecued pork sandwiches made of canned
pork from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as chicken,
spaghetti, rice, corn, broccoli, peaches, rolls, doughnuts and
cookies. Pacholski shops at the Toledo SeaGate Food Bank, which
collects edible but unmarketable food for use by non-profit
agencies at minimal cost.
   Behind the serving counter are several donated birthday cakes.
Nobody seems to mind the smudged icing, judging from the number of
celebrants lining up to pick out cakes. ``They're very popular,''
Bob says with a salesman's pride.
   Regulars at the soup kitchen include 70-year-old Marcile Battle,
who until recently was supporting eight children along with her
92-year-old mother on a $182 monthly Social Security check and $63
worth of food stamps.
   Three of the children are cousins, girls aged 8, 5 and 3. ``The
5-year-old was 3 days old when she came to me. The 8-year-old was 2
months,'' says Mrs. Battle, who says she's been declared ineligible
for welfare benefits.
   ``The other kids had parents, but they left the kids with me. In
July of 1989, they said they were going to a funeral. That funeral
never did end.''
   A social worker from children's services finally picked up the
children, bringing the size of Mrs. Battle's family back down to
five. She says situations like hers aren't unusual, and blames them
on Toledo's drug problem.
   The weekly lunch at the Hospitality Kitchen and the carefully
wrapped leftovers she carries home help stretch her meager food
budget, says Mrs. Battle, whose husband died three years ago. No
matter how strapped she is, ``I always share.''
   ``Food stamps buy me one trip to the grocery store, and the
groceries last til the middle of the month. I can't keep up with
the bills. It's hard.''
   Though grateful for the help the Pacholskis gave her, Mrs.
Battle says she finds eating at the soup kitchen hard.
   ``I would prefer to buy my own groceries. I like to try to feed
my own self. I'd rather any day to help someone else than to have
someone else helping me.''

   DETROIT (AP) _ Good nutrition is just what the doctor ordered
for nearly 850,000 Detroit residents.
   They're enrolled in the Focus: HOPE Food Prescription Program,
one of the oldest and biggest supplemental food programs for people
in high-risk groups: low-income pregnant and postpartum women,
their children up to age 6, and the elderly.
   Each month, participants push grocery carts down the aisles of
one of five Focus: HOPE food centers, stocking up on milk, fruit,
meat, butter, vegetables, cheese, cereal, rice, dried beans, peanut
butter, instant potatoes, egg mix and juice.
   There are six food ``prescriptions,'' depending on a
participant's age. Having filled the appropriate one, the shopper
then passes through a checkout counter complete with a bar-code
scanner to speed things up.
   Similar foods are available to qualified people in two dozen
cities under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   But in Detroit, ``we do things differently,'' says Eleanor
Josaitis, who co-founded Focus: HOPE, a civil and human rights
organization, in the aftermath of the 1967 riots.
   One difference in the Detroit program is how it looks.
   Focus: HOPE food centers resemble grocery stores. ``We try to
set things up where people can come in, get their carts and do
their own shopping,'' Josaitis says.
   ``If a mother comes into the food center with a small child and
pushes a shopping cart, that child may see his mother as just going
to the grocery store. She may not have a lot of choices, but if she
wants to pick one item over another _ green beans, say, instead of
corn, she can do that. It's a small thing, but it's a symbol of
dignity, of how we like to treat people.''
   The food centers also are equipped with closed-circuit
televisions that run ads encouraging people to look into other
Focus: HOPE programs, such as employment training, housing, day
care and education.
   Agencies in a number of cities have modeled programs after
Detroit's, says Josaitis, who held a national conference two years
ago to share information about its principles and design.
   The food packages, designed by a dietician, are intended as
supplements, although infants are given a full month's supply of
formula. The USDA buys the food.
   ``By using the national purchasing power, we can provide food to
three times as many people,'' says Josaitis. She says 846,613
people filled food prescriptions last year. When the program began
in 1971, it served 85,058.
   Senior citizens with incomes up to 130 percent of poverty
($7,774 for a one-person household), and women with incomes up to
185 percent of poverty ($11,063 for one) are eligible.
   Once accepted, each participant is entitled to six monthly trips
to the food center. They then must be rescreened, by the state
Health Department or a private doctor. If their condition is
unchanged, they continue on the program another six months.
   A network of 40,000 volunteers provides transportation or food
delivery to those who need it. It also builds awareness of the
hunger problem.
   ``I believe you have to be touched by it,'' says Josaitis. ``If
people don't see or feel an injustice they can't be part of the
solution.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's the last survivor of the Big Four of the
early civil rights movement. Now 70 and blind, James Farmer,
founder of the Congress of Racial Equality, is teaching a special
class at a predominantly white college in Virginia. This is the
first of an intermittent series called Class Act, about prominent
men and women in various fields who have returned to the campus to
share their expertise.

<DATELINE>FREDERICKSBURG, VA. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The distinguished visiting professor
with the patch over his right eye tugs at a tweed sleeve and bends
an ear to his chiming wristwatch.
   ``Twenty-eight minutes past one,'' James Farmer announces in
that resonant, mellifluous voice to a hushed class of 40 juniors
and seniors, leaning forward, pens poised over notebooks.
   ``As I was saying, those troopers were bellowing, `Come on out,
Farmer. We know you're in there.'
   ``I was meant to die that night. They were kicking open doors,
beating up blacks in the streets, interrogating them with electric
cattle prods. I got out alive in a hearse.''
   It was a lovely spring day on the campus of predominantly white
Mary Washington College, a state institution in historic
Fredericksburg, Va. Bright sunshine slanting through the budding
trees gave a roseate glow to the white-columned Georgian brick
buildings.
   But the imposing black figure at the lecture desk in Monroe Hall
was wrapped in the darkness of another time, in another Southern
state.
   He couldn't see the azaleas blushing at the windowsill or sniff
the cherry blossoms just come into bloom around the fountain in the
square. There was too much tear gas billowing through the busted
windows of the Plymouth Rock Baptist Church in Plaquemine, La. And
the splashing fountain brought back the swoosh of the fire hose
washing hymn books and Bibles down the aisle as the mob smashed
pews and ransacked the church.
   ``Scared spitless,'' Farmer says, recalling that violent summer
night a quarter of a century ago.
   One moment he's a terrified Freedom Rider pleading with the
local telephone operator to put a call through ``to the White
House, the attorney general, the FBI in New Orleans.''
   Then he's a redneck deputy, snarling through jowls chock-full of
chaw, ``We know you're in there, Farmer.''
   Next he's the spunky lady operator of the funeral parlor down
the street telling him to ``play dead in the back of that hearse''
and ordering the driver to take dirt roads known only to blacks
since plantation days.
   Then he's himself, the founder of CORE, the Congress of Racial
Equality, wondering if that night in Louisiana, less than a week
after the march on Washington and Martin Luther King's ``I had a
dream'' speech, would be his last on Earth.
   ``This guy is tremendous,'' says senior Eric Cooper, one of the
students in Farmer's course, ``The History of the Civil Rights
Movement,'' a full three-credit course in the history department.
``He's a living piece of history. It's hard for students our age to
imagine an America where blacks could not go into a restaurant, had
to ride in the Jim Crow coach next to the engine and were hunted
down like possums or some other swamp dweller for daring to
register to vote.
   ``Here is a man who has changed history. He's seen it all, and
now the tragedy is he sees nothing.''
   But in the classroom the now totally blind champion of civil
rights sees something he never saw before in his 70 years _ a ray
of hope, ``just a glimmer.''
   ``The hope for America is with these young people,'' he says,
gathering up a bundle of their term papers. ``Their minds are not
closed. At the beginning of the semester, black kids and white kids
alike find it difficult to grasp that this is the way things were
here.''
   With Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young now dead,
Farmer is the last of the Big Four of the civil rights movement.
``We were the knights of the round table,'' he chuckles, counting
the nine steps down to the taxi taking him home for a brief rest
before facing an evening class of nearly 200 freshmen and
sophomores.
   Farmer is now in his fifth year at the college named for George
Washington's mother, where in a student body of 3,500, two-thirds
are female and 4 percent black.
   The preacher's kid from Marshall, Tex., who grew up on a series
of black Baptist campuses, where his father, a Ph.D. from Boston
University, taught theology, is still at it, preaching, teaching
with compelling charm a non-violent approach to racial harmony.
   Eloquently he drives home the ``fundamental lesson of the civil
rights movement: Be better than your former self, not better than
the South Africans, and thereby make a better world.''
   Students are awed at Farmer's lack of bitterness toward those
who have wronged him and his race.
   Sherry Brinser, a Spanish major from Richmond, says, ``He's
fascinating. It all happened to him, and yet there's no bitterness.
None. How can he forgive what he can't forget?''
   In the Eagle's Nest, the student snack bar, some compared Farmer
with the actor James Earl Jones: the rich voice, the fullback's
build, the features borrowed from a Roman coin, the deep infectious
laughter, the mimic's ability to play all parts.
   They cited the morning lecture when he was suddenly the owner of
a diner on U.S. Route 1 between New York and Baltimore, turning
away young blacks trying to integrate eateries along what they had
renamed ``Freedom Highway.''
   ``We don't serve Negroes here.''
   ``Well, that's fine by us,'' Farmer replies in his own voice.
``We don't eat them.''
   ``He's very expressive. You think you're right there,'' says
Patty Charron, a junior from Springield. Va.
   ``But he's a lot more than just a performer,'' insists Rich
Cooper, from Pittsburgh. ``He speaks from the heart. It's not like
a lecture, it's personal history. Others graduating with me agree
his is one of the five classes you should take before leaving
here.''

   In his campus office, surrounded by plaques, awards and 19
honorary degrees, Farmer says, ``Two-thirds of the graduates have
gone through my class. About 500 a year. A Japanese girl, one of my
brightest students, came here just to attend my class.''
   ``Once thought of becoming a doctor,'' he reminisces, his hands
laced behind his head. ``Couldn't stand the sight of blood. That's
another of life's jokes, considering all the busted heads I've
seen.''
   Instead, he studied for the ministry at Howard University in the
nation's capital, where his father taught the New Testament and
Greek. But he decided against ordination ``because the Baptist
church, like others, was still segregated. Even today, to this
nation's shame, segregation is nowhere as complete as at 11 o'clock
on a Sunday morning.''
   Taking up the civil rights struggle at age 22, Farmer employed
the Gandhi techniques of non-violence to organize a sit-in at the
Jack Spratt Coffee House in Chicago in May, 1942. Thus began CORE.
   ``A lot of soup was dumped over heads and garbage jammed into
sandwiches,'' he says, before the movement was strong enough to
invade the South with unarmed legions of black and white Freedom
Riders.
   In later years, Farmer was a union organizer, ran for Congress
in Brooklyn, N.Y., and lost to Shirley Chisholm, went on the
lecture circuit and engaged in a memorable debate with Malcolm X.
He angered his liberal friends by serving as assistant secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon administration.
   His personal life was never easy. There was resentment among
both his black and white friends against his devoted wife Lula, who
was white and his staunchest supporter. She died in 1976 after a
long, debilitating battle with Hodgkin's disease.
   In 1979, Farmer lost the sight of his right eye to retinal
vascular occlusion, a rare disease that he thinks was brought on by
those hours of exposure to tear gas in Louisiana. ``But the doctors
say there is no evidence in the literature.''
   He reached Chapter 6 in ``Lay Bare The Heart,'' his poignant
autobiography, when the left eye began to go.
   ``I had to resort to a powerful magnifying glass to go on
writing in longhand on yellow legal pads,'' he says.
   When he began teaching, he could make out vague, shadowy shapes
in the first few rows of lecture chairs. ``Now I don't see the
students at all. I just hear voices.''
   Then, with booming laughter, as if the joke had just occurred to
him, he pronounces himself ``literally colored blind. Used to be I
could tell black kids from white kids by their voices. But as
blacks move into the middle class and attend Eastern colleges, they
begin talking like whites. You can't tell anymore by their
enunciation and pronunciation.
   ``No, I don't think black English will disappear. Blacks who
speak downtown English still speak the ghetto language when they go
back to visit the family or attend church.''
   One reason Farmer's classes are the most popular on campus is
the gallery of national figures he summons up from personal
experience:
   The Kennedys: ``When the Freedom Riders reached Montgomery and
rioters held us virtual prisoners in the First Baptist Church,
Bobby Kennedy telephoned Martin Luther King to get me to halt the
march and have a cooling off period. My response was: `We have been
cooling off for 350 years. If we cool off anymore, we will be in a
deep freeze.' The attorney general was furious and that fury was
shared promptly with his brother, the president. So I was never on
good terms with the Kennedys. ''
   Lyndon Johnson: ``At first I was welcome in the Oval Office:
`From Marshall! Doggone, Jim, that's Lady Bird's hometown. Her
daddy had a filling station there.' That bond of Texas engulfed us.
But I soon fell from grace when I refused to go along with a
moratorium on demonstrations during the campaign against
Goldwater.''
   Adam Clayton Powell: ``A clever man. He had more charisma than
Jesse Jackson, but he didn't like the NAACP, which we joked meant,
`Never Annoy Adam Clayton Powell.'''
   Louis Farrakhan: ``Racism of any color is bad. I hate the things
he stands for, but I'd fight for his right to be heard.''
   On the day civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy died, April 17,
Farmer told the class about encouraging Abernathy to write his
controversial autobiography, ``And The Walls Came Tumbling Down.''
But ``I warned him: don't tell all.
   ``He just grinned, but now I wonder if his death wasn't hastened
by the inner turmoil he must have gone through wondering if he had
done an injustice to his dear friend, dearer than a brother, Martin
Luther King. I just wish he hadn't written those three pages about
Martin's sexual escapades on his last night alive. It wasn't
needed. There was nothing new. It had all been written before.''
   In February, Black History Month, Farmer is a guest speaker at
dozens of colleges. Whenever an opportunity arises, he encourages
black athletes to get their diplomas before turning pro.
   ``It's not easy,'' Farmer sighs. ``They are quick to ask, `Hey,
professor, where did it ever get you? Show us your new BMW.''
   But the professor says he learns a lot from his students,
especially from their term papers. ``I give them a choice of a
research paper or writing some personal experience with race
relations. More than half chose a personal experience. They tell of
having a black friend i childhood.
   ``In most cases, as they approached puberty, entered middle
school, they were yanked apart by parents or neighbors who
ostracized them and called them nigger lovers.
   ``It came as a revelation to me that so many white kids had
black playmates and had that traumatic experience. It came up in
paper after paper read to me. Their poignant childhood memories
show that race has colored _ no pun intended _every aspect of this
country's life. None of us, black or white, is untouched by it.''

   but I keep up the vigil anyway outside the local
elementary school.
   My 4-year-old daughter, Rebecca Schiffres, is determined to
attend Lafayette with her big brother, Ethan. But there is only
room for 40 children in the two pre-kindergarten classes, and if I
leave my post under the school's portico I give up my chance to get
one of them.
   It's 3:45 a.m. I have been there since 8:30 the night before. I
stretch out on a borrowed lawn chair, wrapping myself in a sleeping
bag that had not been used for 15 years. I cannot get to sleep.
   All around me, four dozen other parents wait. A lone man paces
on the school courtyard, while someone shoots hoops on the
basketball court around back. A few people use flashlights to read.
   The silence is broken by a few snores from some of those
fortunate enough to sleep and the whispered conversations of those
who couldn't.
   I haven't done anything like this since 1969, when the ``Amazing
Mets'' got into the World Series and I tried to get into the
ballpark. I was in high school then, and staying up all night was
pure excitement.
   Not anymore.
   Why then are we all here, camping out on a rainy night hoping to
win a cherished spot in a public elementary school in the District
of Columbia, a city not known for educational excellence.
   Pre-school programs abound in an area where the majority of
mothers work outside the home. The good ones fill up fast. Ask
Marty Crutsinger, AP's economics writer, who has survived four
all-nighters to get his 4-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, into a
church-run pre-school in suburban Virginia.
   What's different about the Lafayette vigil is that we're waiting
to get our children into a public school.
   The school board has mandated that there be at least one
pre-kindergarten class in each of the city's 124 elementary
schools. Some schools, including Lafayette, have added a second.
But it's not always enough.
   ``If people knew that there were enough pre-kindergarten
programs for everyone, then there wouldn't be the panic,'' says
Maurice Sykes, the district's director of early childhood programs.
But there's not enough money to accommodate everyone, he says.
   Sykes attributes the high demand to the ``second baby boom''
reaching school age, the phenomena of working parents, the full-day
program and the price.
   ``The reason those slots become coveted is because we became
part of the day care network,'' Sykes said. ``If you can provide a
service for free that's when you get competitive.''
   As for the all-night vigils, he says, ``No one is satisfied with
the system. We're trying to figure out a reasonable, equitable
solution.''
   Three years ago, when we considered signing Ethan up for
pre-kindergarten, I arrived at 9:10 the morning of registration and
got No. 32. In the ensuing years, parents have lined up earlier and
earlier to guarantee themselves a slot.
   Last year, people who showed up at dawn still got into the
program. This year, panic set in.
   The first would-be pre-K parent arrived at 5:30 p.m. the evening
before registration. Someone soon arrived with numbers to pass out.
There was a sign-in sheet, too, just as a backstop.
   My husband, Manny Schiffres, and I stopped at the school at 8:15
p.m. as we were returning from a reception. Eight people were there.
   We drove the three blocks to our house. When we got there, the
phone was ringing and a notice was posted near the telephone. ``Get
over to Lafayette. People are already there.'' It was signed by my
next-door neighbor and timed off at 7:30.
   I changed my clothes, putting on a 20-year-old sweater and a
pair of jeans. My neighbor rang the bell. ``Come on. We have to
go,'' she said. Grabbing a down jacket and a cup of cherry yogurt,
I returned to the school with her.
   I was number 16. Rebecca was in!
   People milled around the courtyard. Spouses came with dinner and
with kids to say goodnight. A table with wine and cheese was set up
under a newly posted sign warning that no alcohol or drugs was
permitted within 1,000 feet of the school.

   I sipped apple juice from a box that had been purchased for my
son's lunch and devoured my yogurt. Not much of a dinner.
   Then the rain came, and everyone ran for cover.
   At 9:42 p.m., the 40th parent came. Anyone who arrived after
that would be on a waiting list.
   Some people had alternative plans if their kids didn't get in.
   We could have continued sending Rebecca to Gan HaYeled, the
nursery school run by our synagogue. In Rebecca's two years there,
the teachers instilled in her a love of school. Along the way, she
learned her alphabet and her numbers, to write her name and to get
along with her peers.
   We met the January application deadline, sent in our deposit and
even requested the same teacher that Ethan had as a 4-year-old.
   But Lafayette was part of her life too. She went to the fall
harvest festival and the spring fair. She dressed up for the annual
Halloween parades and applauded at the sixth-grade shows.
   ``I'm going to Lafayette,'' she would brag to anyone who asked
her.
   My husband and I spent hours debating what to do.
   We knew she would fare well, and learn as much, at either
school. So the quality of the programs was not at issue.
   The deciding factors came down to cost (the Lafayette program is
free, compared with $3,100 for the synagogue-run school); the
convenience of having two children at the same school and Rebecca's
wishes.
   And so I keep the vigil.
   Before midnight, the school's custodian opens the building for a
short time, so parents can use the telephone or bathroom. He turns
the lights on under the portico but turns them off again when
people protested that they want to sleep.
   And people slept. Sitting up. Stretched across two chairs. On
the cold cement. Bodies next to bodies.
   I talk to the mothers of two of Ethan's classmates. Each is
trying to get a son into the pre-K program. It would be great, we
say, if our younger kids could be together too.
   We share a pound cake, and conversation _ a real conversation
without interruption from one of the kids.
   As temperatures drop into the 40s, one of the women stuffs her
legs into a plastic garbage bag trying to keep warm. It really
works, someone had told her.
   The other wears layers of borrowed clothing. Friends who had
been through this before brought extra coats. I go back to my chair
and the warmth of my sleeping bag.
   Husbands come to relieve wives and wives to relieve husbands.
There were CARE packages for those who stayed, brought in paper
bags and plastic bags and kids' lunch boxes. My husband is home
sleeping.
   I take a bathroom break. Someone decreed, and everyone agreed,
that you could leave for 15 minutes without losing your place on
line. But no one really keeps track.
   Dawn breaks, and people begin awakening. They stow their gear in
car trunks and then line up according to number.
   Principal Sandra Bond, wearing a T-shirt declaring ``the
principal is always right,'' opens the doors to the school at 8
a.m. Coffee and doughnuts await us, courtesy of the Home and School
Association.
   Later, Mrs. Bond would say she thought of us each time she saw a
flash of lightning or heard a clap of thunder. Why then, parents
grumbled, wouldn't she let us camp out in the gym or cafeteria?
   There has to be a better way, people said.
   Those that had kids in the school, as I did, pushed for
preference for siblings.
   Those who missed the cut argued for a lottery.
   Others said a missed night's sleep was a small price to pay to
get their kids in Lafayette.
   School personnel checked our documents _ birth certificates,
proof of residency and immunization records. All my papers were in
order, and Rebecca was accepted.
   Another family was not so lucky. They were told they were
ineligible because they lived outside the district.
   Welcome to Lafayette, No. 41.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Even as communism crumbles in much of the rest
of the world, Robert Mugabe is still adamant about establishing a
one-party Marxist-Leninist state in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia.
While that makes a lot of businessmen and others uneasy, few
dispute Mugabe's successes in social reforms that have largely
bettered the lot of his people.

<TEXT>
   When former guerrilla chieftain Robert
Mugabe led Rhodesia to independence as black-governed Zimbabwe 10
years ago, he faced a daunting task.
   The economy of the former white-led nation was in tatters.
Racial tensions were rife. Civil war loomed in Matabeleland,
stronghold of opposition leader Joshua Nkomo. And Mugabe's support
for South African guerrillas raised the risk of a backlash from
Pretoria's white-led government _ a break in his main trade routes
through that country, or even a military strike.
   Zimbabwe on April 18 celebrated the 10th anniversary of
independence from Britain with military marches and tribal dancing.
Speaking to a crowd at a stadium outside Harare, Mugabe said he
welcomed the expiration of the 10-year constitution brokered by the
British that contained ``entrenched racial provisions'' protecting
the interests of the 90,000-strong white community.
   He said the second decade of independence would witness even
greater moves toward unity, peace and progress.
   Few dispute that during those first 10 years Zimbabwe made
remarkable progress in the areas of education and health care.
   Now comes the hard part.
   Unemployment is at record levels, along with urban crime. Vague
economic planning has led to rampant inflation, shortages of
essential commodities, and deterioration of the national transport
system.
   And Mugabe's vow to transform one of Africa's few Western-style
democracies into a one-party Marxist-Leninist state has split the
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) and
divided the country's 9.2 million people.
   It has also alarmed local businessmen and foreign governments.
Some question whether the one-time schoolteacher is on the right
political track as his old Eastern European models undergo radical
reforms.
   ``He is obsessed with a unitary system,'' a member of the
party's 160-member Central Committee told The Associated Press, on
condition of anonymity. ``But by no means does he have all the
support he needs in the party or cabinet unless he stampedes it
through.''
   One-party rule has been Mugabe's dream since he was held for a
decade as a political prisoner by the last white Rhodesian prime
minister, Ian D. Smith. At that time, it was a fashionable system
in Eastern Europe and much of the Third World.
   With that system largely discredited abroad, Mugabe's own
credibility is at stake. But Mugabe won't budge.
   ``The multiparty system spells the destruction of our nation,''
he said last year. ``We believe we are one people, one flag, one
identity. Why shouldn't we have one party?'',
   Mugabe won distinction as an eloquent chairman for three years
of the 102-member Non-Aligned Movement of developing nations, an
alternative to the East and West power blocs.
   ``No one ever expected the Non-Aligned Movement to do anything
really tangible,'' says a Western diplomat in Harare. ``But Mugabe
made all the right noises, and his chairmanship was a great success
in those terms.''
   The Zimbabwean leader, habitually clad in dark suits that match
his businesslike manner, exercises the impatient authority of an
austere headmaster.
   Associates say he is sharply intolerant of those who challenge
him, but he rewards loyalty richly.
   He rarely exposes his human side, except on occasional visits to
the mud-and-grass hut villages in the countryside that remind him
of his own birthplace.
   A teetotaler and non-smoker with a fondness for hot, spicy
foods, Mugabe enjoys watching the sedate English game of cricket.
He works out daily at State House on a static exercise bike and
relaxes near a hi-fi to songs from the 1950s, Pat Boone being a
favorite.
   A blinking stare from behind thick spectacles hides stiff
mannerisms. He sports a toothbrush mustache. And, in common with
many African men his age, he dyes his hair to conceal specks of
gray.
   Educated at a Roman Catholic mission, Mugabe is described by
church leaders as an ascetic with high moral principles. However,
he is no longer a practicing Catholic like his aged mother and his
Ghanaian-born wife, Sally, who all attend Mass regularly.
   Yet he's comfortable in the company of clerics, according to the
Rev. Oscar Wermter, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops' Conference,
which opposes his one-party state objective.

   ``He shares our concerns for moral and social justice,'' Wermter
says. ``But when it comes to the freedom of political choice as a
fundamental human right, that's where we part company.''
   Wermter and others fear Mugabe may be sealing his own fate by
pursuing his Marxist goal.
   ``We are afraid, from the African experience, that one-party
states normally end in military coups because there is no other
mechanism for change,'' he says.
   Relations between church and state were not always cozy.
   In 1984, Mugabe vilified church leaders who accused North
Korean-trained Zimbabwean troops of atrocities in the western
Matabeleland province where armed rebels loyal to Nkomo posed a
threat to the government.
   Thousands of civilians were killed, wounded or driven into exile
in operations against the dissidents.
   But the remaining 120 rebels laid down their guns under an
amnesty that followed a unity pact between Nkomo and Mugabe in
December 1988.
   Nkomo, a former political foe now turned friend, is to be sworn
in as one of two vice-presidents this year.
   But his promotion from senior minister may not mollify
supporters of Nkomo's defunct Zimbabwe African People's Union,
which has merged with the ruling party, says Masipula Sithole, a
U.S.-trained professor of political studies at the University of
Zimbabwe.
   Some ex-ZAPU officials from the minority Ndebele tribe, 30
percent of the population, are already disenchanted with the
disproportionately small role they say they play in government,
Sithole says.
   Sithole says Mugabe's popularity is increasingly being viewed as
vain, moody, paranoid and isolated from the people.
   He has no children. An only son died at age 6 while Mugabe was
in prison.
   Mugabe lives behind high walls capped with coils of razor wire.
He travels in a high-speed motorcade escorted by police cars with
wailing sirens, motorcycle outriders and a jeepload of soldiers
armed with machine guns and automatic rifles.
   Mugabe, who won several college degrees while in detention, is
an admirer of executed Romanian dictator Nicolai Ceaucescu, Kim Il
Sung of North Korea and Fidel Castro of Cuba. He argues that
democratic one-party rule eliminates tribal and ideological
divisions that hamper the development of Third World nations.
   ``It is absurd to argue that democracy exists in a one-party
state,'' Sithole says.
   Yet Mugabe makes no attempt to conceal his distaste for
opposition. Before recent elections he spoke darkly about reports
that influential whites were backing opposition politicians. ``If
whites rear their ugly terrorist head ... we will chop that head
off,'' he declared.
   But, on another occasion, talking about his image abroad, Mugabe
smiled and said, ``Look, I am not a monster. I haven't eaten
anyone.''
   Few people, including the 90,000 whites who remain from a peak
of 270,000 in the mid-1970s, dispute Mugabe's successes in social
reforms that have largely bettered the lot of his people.
   Infant mortality dropped as some 450 new rural clinics were
built and 70 percent of all children were immunized against disease.
   High school enrollment swelled ninefold to 695,000, and primary
school attendances doubled to 1.2 million.
   In his anniversary speech, Mugabe said that apart from wheat
imports, Zimbabwe is self-sufficient in food. He also praised local
industries, mainly in the hands of white entrepreneurs.
Manufacturers generate nearly 30 percent of the gross domestic
product of about $4 billion, he said.
   But today unemployment is estimated at almost 25 percent.
   Only Western investment and effective trade liberalization will
ease the unemployment and an inflation rate of 22 percent annually,
says leading black businessman Sam Gozo.
   ``But you can't have proper investment and liberalization where
Marxism is the order of the day,'' he says. ``It just won't fly.''
   Despite recent reforms in neighboring South Africa, and an
easing of regional tensions with black-ruled states, a strong
economic union between the two countries is unlikely while Mugabe
remains a vocal critic of apartheid and an advocate of trade
embargoes against Pretoria.
   ``Whether Mugabe likes it or not, our survival will go
hand-in-hand with the fortunes of South Africa,'' Gozo says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the early days they had to be registered
nurses. Then they had to be young and pretty. Now with the aircraft
cabin ``graying,'' as one said, the nation's flight attendants are
fighting weight restrictions.

   There was a time when airline stewardesses were fired if they
turned 32, got married, became pregnant or had to put on eyeglasses.
   Stewardesses are called flight attendants now, in deference to
men who have joined their ranks, and many of the restrictive rules
have been dumped as a result of anti-discrimination laws and
lawsuits.
   Some flight attendants, however, still are being fired for
weighing too much.
   At American Airlines, the nation's largest employer of flight
attendants, the union is suing the company and challenging some of
the industry's most stringent weight requirements.
   The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union for
American's 16,000 attendants, says the 37-year-old weight
guidelines are an extension of age and sex discrimination.
   The union contends they hearken to the ``Coffee, Tea or Me'' era
when sexy, young stewardesses were marketing tools. Congress had
not yet outlawed age and sex discrimination.
   National Airlines urged travelers to ``Fly me, I'm Cheryl,''
Braniff's sky girls wore hot pants, and Continental promised, ``We
move our tails for you.''
   Now union officials call it an irrational and cruel policy that
forces women in their 40s and 50s to weigh what they did when they
were 21.
   They say attendants sometimes resort to crash diets,
liposuction, breast reductions and drug use, and some develop
eating disorders in an effort to stay trim.
   ``We truly believe the flying public wants professional,
efficient and well-groomed flight attendants, safe airplanes and
on-time service,'' said Tommie Hutto-Blake, a flight attendant from
Ridgewood, N.J. and former union president. ``We don't think the
public cares if a flight attendant wears a size 6 or a size 10.''
   Union members are wearing buttons urging patrons to ``weigh my
job performance, not my body.'' Billboards with similar messages
are going up outside airports.
   Both sides are girding for a 1991 trial date in federal court in
Fort Worth, Texas.
   In April, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
joined the flight attendants' battle, filing a federal class-action
suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit charges the
weight policy discriminates against women, particularly those over
40.
   ``American still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a
male sexist notion of what is sexy,'' said EEOC lawyer Ralph D.H.
Fertig. ``And that's thin.''
   He said American's policy reads that a ``firm, trim silhouette,
free of bulges, rolls or paunches, is necessary for an alert,
efficient image.''
   ``We believe it's in our rights to have an appropriate grooming
standard for our employees,'' said American spokesman Ed Stewart.
``We want a neat, attractive person representing American.''
   Union lawyer Kathleen King of San Francisco said the job has
changed since the 1950s when women like her mother became flight
attendants ``on a lark'' before settling down and getting married.
   ``You've got flight attendants with 20 and 25 years of seniority
who are being thrown out the door because they're a few pounds
overweight,'' she said.
   Last year, Pan American World Airways ended six years of
litigation by raising weight requirements and allowing an extra 9
pounds as flight attendants age. Pan Am also agreed to pay $2.3
million in lost wages to 115 employees who were not allowed to work
because of their weight.
   Other carriers, including Delta Airlines and USAir, have less
stringent weight charts. Delta and Trans World Airlines allow
considerable leeway in pounds for aging flight attendants.
   United Airlines is proposing dropping its weight regulations.
Northwest and Continental have already done so.
   American's weight standards are roughly tied to a 1959
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. chart. At American, a 5-foot-5-inch
attendant may weigh no more than 129 pounds.
   The same employee could weigh up to 138 pounds at Delta, with 4
added pounds as she ages, and up to 150 pounds at Pan Am, plus an
additional 9 pounds as she ages. At United Airlines, she could
weigh up to 137 pounds, plus an extra 9 pounds as she ages.
   American Airlines' weight guidelines were modified slightly in
1975, after a court challenge, but the union argues that 80 percent
of the flight attendants were under 35 then. American dismisses the
argument that a woman inevitably gains weight with age, children or
menopause.
   American Airlines President Robert Crandall, during a recent
speech to about 500 employees in New York, was confronted by Ms.
Hutto-Blake.
   ``We're not all young, thin employees today,'' she told him.
``There has been a graying of the cabin.''
   By her side stood Doris Johnson, 46, of New York, who was
suspended without pay in September after 17 years of flying. She is
5-feet-4, 139 pounds, wears a size 9 shoe, has undergone a
hysterectomy, and has spent a decade fighting to stay below 125
pounds to keep her job.
   ``I must say, in looking at you, I'm surprised. You don't look
like you have a weight problem,'' Crandall told Ms. Johnson. She
took a demotion last week to a ground position to avoid being fired.
   But Crandall insists weight standards are necessary. ``We've got
some people on our airplanes that are way too heavy.''
   In Los Angeles, 28-year veteran Patt Gibbs took a four-year
leave to become union president. Upon her return, the 5-foot-3-inch
Ms. Gibbs was 154 pounds, 29 pounds over her limit.
   ``It was pretty humiliating,'' she said. ``They said, `That's
that. You're too heavy. Lose the weight or you won't have a job.'''
She lost the weight and returned to work.
   Also in Los Angeles, Sherri Cappello was fired the day she
received her 25-year service pin.
   In March, she was elected vice president by the largest number
of votes in the union's history, some measure of how the
rank-and-file think about weight standards.
   In Wisconsin, after flying 43 years, Petey Peterson retired two
years before turning 65 and getting a full pension. She was in the
Berlin Airlift, received American Airlines' Award of Valor, and was
among the last of those who started in days when flight attendants
had to be registered nurses.
   ``I was forced into early retirement because I could no longer
fit the image and take the harassment of the Flight Attendant
Weight Program as enforced by my 29-year-old supervisor,'' she says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The first spring publishers' list of the decade
is loaded with books on sex and love, many looking at what the AIDs
threat has done to the sexual revolution, with some hints at what
the future holds. Here is a sampling.

   Sex in the 1990s: What are we in for?
   The Naughty Nineties? The Nice Nineties?
   A recent spate of books on sex, love and related matters _ about
one title a day came out in February alone _ could offer hints at
the sexual mores of the next 10 years.
   But many of them look more at where we are coming from, rather
than where we are going.
   In ``Mayflower Manners: Etiquette for Consenting Adults,''
former madam Sidney Biddle Barrows brings up the delicate matter of
good breeding and condoms.
   ``Is it assumed,'' she asks, ``that the man will provide them?
Is it therefore rude of the woman to pre-empt that sacred
responsibility by producing them herself?''
   This is definitely a Nineties question. In the World War II era
of Rosie the Riveter, even to hint that a woman carried a supply of
condoms in her pocketbook was decidedly bad form. It was absolutely
unspeakable in the 1930s, the decade of the censorious Hays Office
in Hollywood and a prudish Motion Picture Code.
   But May 6, 1960, was apparently a pivotal date in the history of
American sex. On that day, say Jane and Michael Stern, co-authors
of ``Sixties People,'' ``the Federal Drug Administration declared
Enovid _ the first birth control pill _ safe for prescription sales.
   ``Within six years, one out of five women of child-bearing age
had a prescription. Sixties people were infatuated with `the pill.'
It was a prime symbol of modern life in general.
   ``Thanks to the pill, carefree sex became yet another of the
futuristic possibilities that the new decade offered. A girl on the
pill could have sex any time she pleased.''
   And so we find this passage in Daniel Mark Epstein's ``Love's
Compass, A Natural History of the Heart,'' which contains
recollections of life and love in the 60s:
   ``When Madeline returned to the little college town in the
autumn of my junior year, we found each other at once ... I tried
to assure Madeline that I would love her as she deserved to be
loved, and in the true spirit of the 1960s, we became lovers
without further ceremony or preamble.''
   ``Sex out of wedlock,'' adds Epstein, ``was simply forbidden
until the 1960s, when we legitimized it per force majeure, by
resacralizing erotic love. Such an experience as ours may never be
normal again.''
   For homosexuals, too, the world has changed in recent decades as
many came out into the open. But with AIDS, the Nineties offer the
bleak prospect that life for gays may never be the same again.
   As Allan Berube argues in ``Coming Out Under Fire: Gay Men and
Women in World War II,'' the war itself _ thanks strangely enough
to the growing power of psychiatrists _ was a setback for the gay
community.
   ``Traditionally the military had never officially excluded or
discharged homosexuals from its ranks,'' says Berube, ``but in
World War II a dramatic change occurred. As psychiatrists increased
their authority in the armed forces, they developed new screening
procedures to discover and disqualify homosexual men.
   ``The generation of gay men and women who served in World War II
grew into adulthood fighting one war for their country and another
to protect themselves from their government's escalating
mobilization against them.''
   Half a century later it is a different and deadlier war for the
nation's homosexuals.
   ``There are an estimated 12 million gay men in the United
States, many of whom seek long-term, committed relationships in the
face of the AIDS epidemic,'' says the publisher of Rik Isensee's
``Love Between Men: Enhancing Intimacy and Keeping Your
Relationships Alive.'' A clinical social worker in San Francisco,
Isensee deals with such things as what to do ``when a lover has
AIDS.''
   Could this disease in fact become the bubonic plague of the
1990s, the 20th century version of the Black Death that wiped out a
third of Europe in the 14th century?
   ``More than a million Americans are infected with HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus); of these, statistics indicate that 20
percent to 50 percent will develop AIDS within five years,''
according to Dr. Alan Brauer and his wife Donna J. Brauer, who run
the Brauer Medical and Health Center in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Curiously, the Brauer's dire scenario appears in their jointly
written ``The ESO Ecstasy Program,'' which the publisher bills as
the Sensual Guide for the Nineties.
   Noting that ``orgasm is totally safe,'' this hefty work explains
step by step, in relentless detail, how to achieve ESO (Extended
Sexual Orgasm) in a methodical 12-week program of sexual exercises.
In the 13th week the reader then comes to a chapter titled ``Beyond
Ecstasy.''
   Another medical writer questions whether sex is really a
necessary ingredient of love at all.
   ``Is love always sexually connected?'' asks Dr. Theodore Isaac
Rubin, M.D., in ``Real Love: What It Is and How to Find It.'' He
says the answer is no.
   ``Heterosexual men can love heterosexual men. Heterosexual women
can love heterosexual women. I disagree with those Freudians who
believe that there is always a sexual current or correlation
present.''
   ``Love,'' concludes Rubin, the author of a couple of
best-selling books and a frequent guest on TV shows, ``can be
sexual or non-sexual.''
   Love set free at last in the 1990s from the tyranny of lust?
   ``How much was hoped from sex. How little sex can deliver,''
Professor Camille Paglia observes in her massive study ``Sexual
Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson.''
   Take, as an example, Emily Dickinson herself. The New England
poet, says Paglia, associate professor of humanities at
Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, ``is the American
Sade. She is frightening. This shy Victorian spinster was a male
genius and visionary sadist, a fictive sexual persona of towering
force.''
   As Archie Bunker, that amiable television bigot of the 1970s,
once said, ``Sex used to be up in the mind. That's where it
belongs.''

   Richard Beymer says he had no idea how rotten
his character would become when he was cast as the kingpin of ABC's
``Twin Peaks.''
   Beymer plays business entrepreneur Benjamin Horne in director
David Lynch's new series that offers a quirky blend of soap opera,
murder mystery and black comedy.
   He says Johanna Ray, the casting director, had originally
considered him for the role of the psychiatrist, the part Russ
Tamblyn plays. Then Lynch suggested he could be Benjamin Horne.
   ``I had no idea now nefarious and slimy he was going to be,''
Beymer says. ``Every time I got a new script he was doing this or
that. It's like waking up one morning and finding yourself an arch
villain. Isn't that a nightmare?''
   Horne owns the Great Northern Hotel, a department store and
other properties, but is also conspiring with Catherine Packard
Martell (Piper Laurie) to acquire the Packard Sawmill.
   The show centers on the murder of Laura Palmer, a high school
homecoming queen who had a mysterious link to virtually everyone in
the picturesque lumber mill town of Twin Peaks near the
Washington-Canadian border. Each episode slowly reveals the dirty
secrets of its characters.
   ``Twin Peaks'' is an acting comeback for Beymer, whose career
faltered after youthful starring roles in such hit films as ``West
Side Story'' and ``The Diary of Anne Frank.'' He worked mostly as a
film editor, cinematographer and filmmaker before returning to
acting in the 1980s.
   Beymer was born in Iowa, but his family moved here when he was a
child. He began working on a local television show when he was 10.
At 13 he was in ``So Big'' and went to Rome for ``Indiscretions of
an American Wife.'' He was in ``Diary of Anne Frank'' when he was
19 and ``West Side Story'' two years later.
   This summer Beymer will direct a theatrical movie based on his
adaptation of Michael Wolk's novel, ``The Big Picture.''
   ``I did four or five films after `West Side Story,''' Beymer
says. ``I didn't quit. Things changed. I went to New York and got
into the Actors Studio with the encouragement of Joanne Woodward.
I'd been in pictures with Joanne and Paul Newman and Eli Wallach
and I had never studied acting.
   ``Then in early 1964 I became socially conscious and went to
Mississippi for the voter registration drive. It struck me as a
wonderful thing to document. I bought a 16mm Bolex camera and
filmed everything I saw. I brought the film back to Los Angeles and
spent the next nine months editing it.''
   The documentary, which became ``A Regular Bouquet,'' was
narrated by Robert Ryan. It was shown on the PBS series ``Eyes on
the Prize.''
   Beymer later made educational films and spent six years on a
film called ``Innerview.''
   In 1984 he had a starring role in the ABC series ``Paper Dolls.''
   ``Thankfully, they canceled it,'' he says. ``I ran a sportswear
fashion company. I was ready for it to be over after 13 shows. It
was totally about hair and makeup and glamour.''
   Beymer says he wants to film ``The Big Picture'' as
inconspicuously as possible in New York City. He wrote the
screenplay and will direct, but will not appear in it. He says the
title will be changed because another movie has the same title.
   ``The process is what interests me,'' he says. ``I'm not
interested in going out with trucks and hair and makeup and
creating a big circus. I want a film that uses real people and
integrates real situations into the film. Hollywood films focus on
the star. You don't get to know anyone else.''
   The main character in ``The Big Picture'' is Max Popper, who
writes pornography to support his other writing and becomes caught
up in a murder.
   ``It takes place around Times Square, where all those wonderful
old movie houses now show porno films.''

   Curt Dempster champions the one-act play, an art
form embraced by playwrights but usually ignored by Broadway.
   Eugene O'Neill wrote a lot of one-acts. So did Tennessee
Williams and Joe Orton. Neil Simon turned out ``Plaza Suite'' and
``California Suite.'' David Mamet still writes one-acts. So do
Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter, Christopher Durang, Tom Stoppard and
others.
   But except for Simon's efforts, the works rarely get to
Broadway. One-act plays, considered death at the box office, are
the stepchildren of the commercial theater. And most of the time,
they are not part of the regular subscription seasons at the
country's larger regional or non-profit theaters either.
   One-act plays flourish, however, at festivals, celebrations that
offer everything from simple readings to fully staged productions.
And there are scores of them across the country, according to the
Theater Communications Group, a national organization for
non-profit professional theater.
   From the Tennessee Williams New Orleans Literary Festival
One-Act Play Contest to the Minnesota One-Act Play Festival to the
National One-Act Play Contest by Actors Theater of Louisville to
the Young Playwrights Festival in New York, they all celebrate the
short drama.
   One of the best-known is the one-act marathon run by Dempster at
New York's Ensemble Studio Theater, a small theater company located
in an old West Side furniture warehouse a block from the Hudson
River.
   This off-off-Broadway theater, founded by Dempster in 1971, does
a lot of other things. EST, with a staff of about 35 full- and
part-time employees, presents full-length works and staged readings
each year. But the jewel in its theatrical crown is its annual
six-week marathon of one-act plays.
   This year's festival began in early May and runs until June 20.
Among the well-known writers represented by the 12 one-acts spread
over three separate evenings are Mamet, Frank D. Gilroy, John Ford
Noonan, Romulus Linney and Joyce Carol Oates. But there are
newcomers, too, such as 24-year-old Paul Weitz and Susan Kim, who
is having her first professional production anywhere.
   Among the one-acts being done this year are a blues-tinged,
1990s version of ``Hamlet,'' by Shel Silverstein; ``Eulogy for
Mister Hamm,'' a short musical by Michael John LaChiusa set in a
seedy hotel, and ``Tonight We Love,'' a comedy by Romulus Linney
about love in a nursing home.
   Ensemble Studio Theater, which Dempster heads as artistic
director, began its one-act festival in 1978. At that time, they
were all alone, Dempster says. Now there are nearly a dozen one-act
festivals in New York alone.
   ``We wanted to focus attention on the neglect the one-act had
fallen into,'' he recalls. ``We wanted to restore it to its place
in literature.''
   Most of the one-acts EST performs are by its playwriting unit,
which now numbers about 60 members. But the theater, which has a
yearly budget of about $800,000, also looks at one-act plays sent
in by regional theaters and unknown writers.
   ``We get a couple thousand a year,'' Dempster says. ``Play
readers go through them and evaluate them.''
   After the number is cut to about 100, the EST staff reads them
and the number is sliced to 40. After more discussions, the list is
cut to 20 finalists and then 12 plays are chosen from that group.
   ``It's a long process that takes all year to do,'' Dempster
says. ``There's some yelling and screaming. I'm sort of like the
president, but have an unofficial gentleman's agreement with a
committee of artist members. They have a veto over one play that I
may love and they hate, and if I hate a play they all love, I can
veto that. The plays we finally have up on stage are plays we can
all support.''
   With all the material coming in, the readers tend to notice fads
or trends.
   ``Those types of plays don't tend to get into the marathon
because they usually are plays that are topical ideas rather than
artistic ideas,'' Dempster says. ``Like child abuse plays or plays
about alcoholism. Phone sex and incest plays are big now. We
probably read 20 plays a year on incest.
   ``If somebody writes a play now about alcoholism, I say, `Did
you ever read ``Come Back, Little Sheba,'' by William Inge?',''
Dempster says. ``That's a wonderful, little, realistic American
play about a man who's an alcoholic. And it says everything you can
say about the tragedy of alcoholism. If you can't do better than
that, why write one?''
   Things looked up for the lowly one-act play in New York this
season. There were several major collections of one-acts. At
Lincoln Center, artistic director Gregory Mosher paired Mamet's
``Bobby Gould in Hell'' with ``The Devil and Billy Markham'' by
Shel Silverstein, two devilishly funny one-acters.
   The New York Shakespeare Festival currently has a big success
with ``Spunk,'' a trio of plays adapted by George C. Wolfe from
three stories by the black writer Zora Neale Hurston. It also is
doing Caryl Churchill's ``Hot Fudge,'' pairing it with a short
two-act play by the same playwright called, what else, ``Ice
Cream.'' And Manhattan Theater Club revived Terrence McNally's zany
double bill that went under the collective title of ``Bad Habits.''

<TEXT>
   Forty years after Sam Walton first hung
out his shingle, Walton's 5&amp;10 will reopen to show how a little
rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the
same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for
business on May 9, 1950.
   The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing
discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations. It
concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how
Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
   The window displays date back to the store's opening, with
Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some
Ivory Snow. Inside, an electronic map details the company's
1,500-plus store chain today.
   Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton
donned for his ``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after
challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit
in 1984. The goal was accomplished and he danced.
   The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of
the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of
Detroit.
   Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount
City in 1962. Both will be on hand for the opening, along with a
sprinkling of other dignitaries, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the
dedication speaker.
   Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also
has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store,
including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
   Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced
baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s. Typical of the Wal-Mart
outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed ``a place to grow and to
dream'' in a video on the Walton family.
   After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben
Franklin store in Newport in 1945. He lost the lease on that one,
and relocated to Bentonville. That's where the story took off.
   Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to
take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.
   Walton ``said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores'' and
needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his
brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent
interview.
   That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's ``learn as you go''
training program.
   ``I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing
the floor with Sam,'' Bogle said.
   Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story. In one
video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of
Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the
opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.
The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.
   ``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount
store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was
president of a drugstore chain at the time.
   And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when
Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to
Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really
didn't see a future in it.''
   Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public
affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the
term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart
employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's
leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right
time.''
   At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed
272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion. Sam's Wholesale Club
closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to
enter the California market.

<HEAD>Middle School Students Flying 5,000 Miles to Visit McDonald's</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four local middle school students are
traveling 5,000 miles for a hamburger and fries.
   The students, members of an eighth grade civics class, are
flying to the Soviet Union this week on an 11-day tour sponsored by
Steel of West Virginia Inc.
   They'll be free to do and see what they want in the Soviet Union
and Berlin, with one exception.
   To make sure they understand the ins and outs of world
economics, the students must visit the Moscow McDonald's.
   ``Just to drive it home to 14-year-olds, the only stipulation is
that they have to stand in line at McDonald's and buy a
hamburger,'' said teacher and chaperone Jean McClelland.
   Officials of Steel of West Virginia, which makes custom steel
products, have been participating in a program in which local
business officials visit Ms. McClelland's civics classes once a
week to teach students about economics.
   But while the other visitors have been content to provide gifts
for a school-sponsored auction at the end of the term, Steel of
West Virginia's representatives opted for a more expensive present.
The company is footing the $14,000 bill for the trip including air
fare, lodging and the cost of obtaining passports.
   ``We believe that we can have an impact upon the children ...
that will affect them positively for the rest of their lives,''
said Larry Gue, vice president of human affairs at Steel of West
Virginia. ``That's all we're looking for.''
   He said the company picked the Soviet Union because of the
economic lessons presented by the Moscow McDonald's: the difference
between Huntington's McDonald's and its inexpensive fast food, and
the Moscow operation, where customers are willing to stand in line
for hours to spend a substantial part of their paycheck for
essentially the same items.
   ``The idea is hopefully they'll understand the American free
enterprise system,'' Gue said.
   McClelland has 25 students in her civics class. The class came
up with the criteria their teacher used in picking the four winners
including attendance, grades and willingness to go new places and
eat strange foods.
   They also were given one week for research and then asked to
write an essay about the Soviet Union. Even the worst students gave
it a shot, McClelland said.
   ``I had never, ever gotten essays of that quality before,'' she
said.
   One eventual winner, Jason Simms, wrote a paper titled ``Is the
Party Over?'' Another, Sonja Meenach, wrote about communications in
the Soviet Union.
   ``It's exciting and the chance of a lifetime,'' said another
winner, Sara Walker.
   The group flies to New York on Steel of West Virginia's
corporate jet Wednesday, then catches a flight to Frankfurt, West
Germany, for a 5-hour layover and a connecting flight to Leningrad.
   McClelland and the students will tour the Soviet Union for a
week, then travel to Berlin for three days before returning to the
United States.
   Although just four students were chosen for the trip, their
fellow students have been caught up in the excitement, McClelland
said.
   ``The whole school's been studying the Soviet Union,'' she said.
``They've been having speakers, videos. Music classes have been
studying Russian composers. Health classes have been studying jet
lag. Even math classes have been studying how far it is to Moscow.''
   During their trip, the students will make videotapes and attempt
to call their classmates during class.
   ``We wanted to share the experience,'' McClelland said. ``We
didn't want to be selfish.''

   Even the Louvre's curators would
envy the masterpieces in the gallery next door to the lunch counter
advertising a grilled cheese special.
   Van Gogh's ``Les Iris'' is around the corner from a few Monet
landscapes at the storefront gallery in Fort Lauderdale. Across the
room, works from the Italian Renaissance and the early American
Hudson River School share the same wall.
   They're all fakes. They're all for sale.
   ``A forger? Yes, we're expert forgers you could say. But we make
no attempt to deceive. We don't pretend to sell original works. We
sell reproductions,'' said Ernest Thomas Cummins, president of
Heritage House Trading Group Ltd.
   ``We have all the thrill of being a forger, but no risk.''
   With prices for original art rising into the tens of millions,
some art lovers are turning to high-quality copies done by expert
artists. In addition, some museums confronting skyrocketing
insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces
and displaying a reproduction, said Cummins.
   No major U.S. art museum is known to be displaying reproductions
in place of originals. Such a practice would raise questions about
why people visit museums in the first place. But museum security
has become a growing concern.
   Last month, a man in Amsterdam sprayed a Rembrandt with an acid
solution and caused minor damage. In March, thieves dressed as
police officers robbed 11 paintings and other objects from Boston's
Gardner Museum.
   Bids for paintings have climbed at auction houses. In 1987,
Australian investor Alan Bond paid a record $53.9 million for ``Les
Iris.''
   At Fort Lauderdale-based Heritage House, prices run from about
$1,000 to $10,000 for the paintings of paintings, depending on the
size and complexity of the original, said Cummins, 34, a founder of
the upscale Robb Report magazine. Heritage House, which started
producing the repainted masters in late 1987, also has opened a
shop in Carmel, Calif.
   The Heritage House works are full paintings, rather than
photographs or prints.
   ``We deal with people who want to live with great art, not just
visit it,'' he said.
   A telephone call usually begins the three- to four-month process
of making a reproduction. Heritage House advertises in art and
leisure publications. A small classified in The Wall Street Journal
recently brought in dozens of inquiries, said Cummins.
   ``We get all kinds of calls,'' he said. ``Some people want
specific paintings or copies of originals they already have to put
in a second home. On the other hand, we get calls from people
saying, `Can you do something with a dog?'''
   Once a commitment is made, Cummins contacts one of the nearly
200 European artists used by the gallery. In Europe, where copying
masterpieces is a centuries-old craft, specially trained painters
often use the pigments and brushes typical of the period of the
original.
   A completed painting is then placed in a frame closely
resembling its era. Sometimes, the gallery purchases 17th century
furniture to use the wood for frames, said Cummins.
   The final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and
natural heat and humidity. ``We can make special types of cracks
from little spider-web types to long splits,'' said Cummins.
   To guard against misrepresentations, the canvases and frames are
stamped and the paintings contain markings only visible under an
ultraviolet light.
   ``We're working in techniques that have been handed down for
centuries,'' said Cummins. ``The master copier hands down his
knowledge to the apprentices and so on. There is nothing new to
what we are doing.''
   Only recently, however, has the demand for near-perfect
reproductions reached beyond a handful of collectors.
   Several European galleries now specialize in copies of priceless
musuem works. Parisian gallery owner Daniel Delamere has gained
status in the art world for selling repoductions and promising
never to copy the same work again.
   Although Delamere bills his so-called one-of-a-kind
reproductions as an investment that could appreciate in value,
Cummins said Heritage House works are merely decorations.
   ``People want our paintings because they love art and appreciate
a real painting as opposed to a lithograph or something,'' he said.
   Thomas Hoving, editor of Connoisseur magazine and former
director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, said there may
be a limited market for quality reproductions, but he knows of no
major U.S. museum displaying copies.
   ``Some people may want these paintings in their home. I do not
see any market for museums,'' he said.
   But even known forgeries are finding a niche among art
auctioneers. Last month in London, Bonhams gallery put on the block
30 paintings by the late master forger Elmyr de Hory. Nearby, the
British Museum's exhibit ``Fake? The Art of Deception'' features
nearly 600 skillful imitations.
   International copyright laws prohibit commercial copies of
artists' works until 50 years after their death. Heritage House
also does not attempt reproductions of watercolors and multi-media
works, said Cummins.
   Cummins closely guards the identities of his copiers, claiming
many fear public disclosure would drop the prices for their
original pieces and draw ridicule from peers.
   ``It's a very sensitive subject and most would prefer to simply
keep it a secret,'' he said.
   Still, some of the artists' eccentricities cannot be hidden.
   ``We have some artists who walk around in the clothes of the
period they are painting in,'' said Cummins. ``Sometimes we get
letters from them written in an archaic style that you can barely
understand. It's a strange business.''

<HEAD>Union at McDonnell Douglas Approves New Three-Year Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the largest union at McDonnell
Douglas Corp. have approved a new three-year contract at the
aerospace-defense giant, averting a strike that union officials
said appeared almost certain a week ago.
   Union members voted Sunday to accept the contract 5,379 to
2,463, said Cassell Williams, president of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837.
   Negotiators reached agreement on the contract Saturday,
following an 18-hour bargaining session that began Friday morning.
Negotiations had been held intermittently since March 20.
   Williams said he was surprised by the abrupt change in contract
negotiations last week. ``I thought we'd be on the picket line,''
he said.
   Vince DeBlaze, McDonnell Douglas' chief negotiator, said the
vote showed the union agreed that the new contract is fair to both
sides.
   ``We've been through a tough round of negotiations, but it all
paid off today,'' he said.
   Under the new contract, workers are guaranteed a 5{ percent pay
increase in the first year, followed by two annual raises of 3
percent each, Williams said. In addition, workers will get a 4
percent salary bonus each year, he said.
   Hourly wages now average $14, Williams said.
   ``We're happy that we don't have to strike, but we're unhappy
about not getting more,'' Williams said. ``We would have liked to
have gotten more money for our retirees, and we would have liked to
increased benefits in our insurance and savings plans.''
   Had a strike developed, it would have been one in a series of
blows that have been dealt to McDonnell Douglas, the area's No. 1
employer with 40,000 workers based in St. Louis.
   The market for the company's jet fighters, helicopters and giant
military cargo planes has shrunk because of cuts at the Pentagon.
McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft subsidiary, Douglas Aircraft
in Long Beach, Calif., also is losing money, and the company's
stock price has traded recently at a 52-week low.
   The contract vote was announced at the close of a three-hour
meeting Sunday.
   Some union members said they had wanted more from the pact.
   Terra Johnson, who has worked at the company two years, said she
had voted against the contract because she felt the retirement
benefits were inadequate.
   ``Most of the young people here don't think about retirement,
but I'm getting old enough to start worrying about it,'' she said.
   But DeBlaze said, ``What you have to look at is the total
package. We came up with a package that was acceptable, that had
substantial improvements for the union.''
   District 837 represents 11,850 of about 13,000 hourly
wage-earners at McDonnell Douglas.
   Other McDonnell Douglas unions in St. Louis include two
Teamsters locals, Electrical Workers Local 1 and one representing
plant guards. Each union has a separate contract and separate
negotiations.

<HEAD>Sees Trade Accord As Step To Full EC Membership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak Prime Minister Marian
Chalfa Monday signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with
the European Community, which he termed a key step to full
membership in the bloc by 1999.
   The accord showed Czechoslovakia's commitment to democracy and
market economy that must lead to EC membership ``before the end of
the century,'' Chalfa told the foreign ministers of the 12 EC
nations at a signing ceremony.
   ``Our objective is to achieve total compatibility with the
European Community,'' he said, adding Czechoslovakia was ready to
begin talks in the fall on associate EC membership.
   ``We aspire to become a full member of the Community (and) are
optimistic on that score,'' Chalfa told reporters later.
   The accord he signed with the EC replaces a commercial agreement
signed in December, 1988.
   The EC's two-way trade with Czechoslovakia now totals $2.4
billion a year.
   The new 10-year accord covers trade in industrial and
agricultural goods and will remove quantitative trade restrictions.
It also opens the door to economic cooperation in industry,
agriculture, financial services, environmental protection,
vocational training and energy, including nuclear energy.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today as
Wall Street awaited a record-sized offering of government
securities this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.03 to 2,708.33

increases in long-term interest rates.
   But those worries lost a little of their edge late last week,

<HEAD>Good Planting Weather Sends Corn, Soybean Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weighing on the market is the dry weather that is forecast for
corn and soybean crop areas this week. Dry weather should aid in
the planting of crops.
   Corn futures aren't expected to be helped by Friday's
announcement that the Soviet Union has purchased 600,000 metric
tons of corn, traders say.
   Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said the purchase already has been factored into the
market.
   The return of good weather to South America is allowing
Argentine farmers to resume the harvesting of their soybean crop.
That is expected to effect soybean futures.
   Analysts say strong export demand should give some support to
wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract fordelivery in May at $3.78 a bushel; corn was a \
cent to 1{ cents lower with May at $2.86{ a bushel; oats were 1}
cents to 2{ cents lower wtih May at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans were
3} cents to 7 cents lower with May at $6.22 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Higher cash prices and retail purchases in advance of the
Memorial Day holiday are giving a boost to livestock futures.
   Higher cash prices for pork products and and light movement of
live hogs to slaughter is supporting pork futures.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 74.90
a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .52 cent higher with May
at 84.37 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .68 cent higher
with June at 64.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .63 cent
to .85 cent higher with May at 69.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed and pork futures were higher in
Friday's trading.

support from crucial shareholders, ADDs late-morning stock price.
Picks up 14th graf pvs, The USX...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn took his battle with USX Corp.
management to the company's annual meeting today, but the corporate
raider conceded that his plan to split the steel-energy giant in
two could fail.
   Icahn, USX's biggest shareholder, disclosed the pessimism as he
urged other stockholders to approve his proposal for separating the
company's healthier Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary from its laggard
U.S. Steel business.
   About 600 shareholders packed a junior high school auditorium in
Findlay, Marathon's hometown, to hear Icahn and USX management
present their views on how to shape the future of one of the
biggest U.S. industrial corporations.
   The vote on Icahn's plan is widely seen as a test of how much
influence corporate takeover strategists still have, now that much
of the muscle to back up their threats _ billions of dollars in
financing _ has atrophied because of a severe decline in their war
chest, the market for high risk ``junk bonds.''
   Results of the vote aren't expected for at least a week. But
Icahn, who has 13.3 percent of USX shares, or about 34 million
shares, admitted as the meeting began that he might not have the
crucial support needed from five or six large institutional
investors. About 200 million shares were expected to be voted.
   These large institutions, whom, Icahn didn't identify, preferred
to allow management to ``do it on their own,'' he told shareholders.
   Under Icahn's plan, 80 percent of U.S. Steel would be spun off
as a dividend to shareholders. Each shareholder would own stock in
U.S. Steel and Marathon that Icahn estimated would be worth a
combined value of $48.
   The unlikelihood of approval evidently depressed USX's stock
price late this morning. Shares were trading at $33.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange, down 50 cents from Friday.
   Several shareholders objected to Icahn's plan and backed USX
Chairman Charles Corry, who wants to keep both steel and energy
under one roof. The anti-Icahn shareholders said they want USX to
remain intact so the steel and energy businesses could support each
other when one wasn't doing well.
   Corry also contended that the steel business's profitability had
improved in recent years and that he too was frustrated by the
company's relatively low stock price. Nonetheless, he told
shareholders, ``The real question is would the specific Icahn
proposal address that?''
   Icahn's comments generally were met with polite appluse, but
shareholders calling for the defeat of his proposal got a larger
hand from the gathering.
   The meeting today was preceded by an intense lobbying effort by
both sides to woo shareholders.
   ``It's disappointing when a management appears to reject a
program that could do nothing but benefit all shareholders,'' Icahn
said in an open letter in newspapers to Corry last week. Corry
respnded with his own open letter, calling Icahn's proposal ``is
flawed and is neither cost nor tax efficient.''
   Even if Icahn's proposal doesn't garner a majority, analysts who
have followed the company and the takeover business in general
speculated USX would have to respond if his plan received a
substantial number of votes.
   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, is a veteran of wars
with management at USX and other big companies, and has learned he
can win even in defeat. He lost a fight to unseat the board of
Texaco Inc. two years ago, but the oil giant later restructured and
he took home a $338.6 million dividend.
   The USX vote represents a test of sorts on the future of
takeover strategists. Stymied by a lack of financing since the
collapse of the junk bond market last fall, would-be dealmakers and
corporate raiders have returned to proxy votes and shareholder
proposals to seek control of companies or a bigger voice in
management.
   A clear loss for Icahn would place into doubt how much power a
strategist has these days.
   In March, investor Harold Simmons lost a fight to unseat the
board of Lockheed Corp. The big winners in that battle were the big
institutional investors, who forced Lockheed management to make
some big concessions in exchange for their support.

<HEAD>Rig Count Shows Small Increase of Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs improved slightly this week, increasing by three to total 930,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The rig count showed a modest gain after posting declines for
several weeks. Last week, the count slipped by five to 927.
   A year ago, the rig count was 764, Baker Hughes said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count is the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity. It reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Louisiana posted the largest
gain with eight, followed by California with three. Michigan and
Wyoming each gained two, while Colorado, Ohio and Texas had one
more each.
   Oklahoma's count was down by seven, while New Mexico and
Pennsylvania each lost two. Kansas and North Dakota each lost one.

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
today the United States will support increasing the resources of
the International Monetary Fund only if it agrees to crack down on
poor countries behind in their loan payments.
   Brady's comments, to IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, came
one day after finance leaders of the world's seven largest
industrial powers endorsed a 50 percent boost in the fund's
resources to $180 billion from the current $120 billion.
   Brady acknowledged that the 152-nation lending organization
needs more money to meet new demand for its loans from Eastern
European countries moving from communism to capitalism, as well as
for developing nations. Although the United States had supported a
smaller boost, he said it has agreed to 50 percent as a compromise.
   ``We firmly believe that the IMF must have adequate resources
... to continue to fulfill its critical responsibilities in the
world economy,'' he said.
   However, he said the United States would support an increase in
capital contributions from member nations, called quotas, only if
the fund adopts a new strategy to wring $4 billion in back payments
from 11 countries _ Sudan,Zambia, Peru, Honduras, Guyana, Cambodia,
Vietnam, Liberia, Panama, Sierra Leone and Somalia.
   ``These arrears pose a fundamental challenge to the IMF's
financial integrity and its central role in the world economy,''
Brady said.
   The Group of Seven _ finance ministers and central bank chiefs
from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France,
Canada and Italy _ met Sunday in an ornate caucus room in the
Capitol.
   They said a 50 percent quota increase ``would provide the fund
with the resources to fulfill its central responsibilities in the
world economy.''
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus originally sought a 100
percent increase to enable the fund to support emerging capitalism
in Eastern Europe and back Brady's strategy for easing the crushing
$1.3 trillion Third World debt.
   Many developing countries are pushing for a bigger increase, and
70 percent of the IMF membership has supported an increase of
two-thirds or more.
   The issue moves today to the 22-nation Interim Committee, the
IMF policy board. The increase must be approved by 85 percent of
the fund's voting power. The United States, with 20 percent of the
voting power, effectively has a veto on the matter.
   ``It's going to be a difficult meeting, one that will take some
time and some very sensitive listening,'' said Canadian Finance
Minister Michael Wilson, chairman of the Interim Committee.
   Currency markets, often the focus of Group of Seven gatherings,
received less attention. Exchange rates have been relatively stable
since the ministers' last meeting on April 7 in Paris, but the yen
remains near a three-year low against the dollar.
   In Sunday's statement, the officials ``noted with satisfaction
the recent stability of exchange markets'' but said they ``remained
of the view that the present level may have undesirable
consequences for the global adjustment process.''
   A weak yen helps boost the U.S. trade deficit by making American
goods more expensive in Japan and Japanese products cheaper in the
United States.
   Also on the agenda of the session, closed to reporters and the
public, were the economic efects of the reunification of Germany
and a review of progress since Brady launched the new debt strategy
in March 1989.
   The Group of Seven gathering preceded the spring meetings today
and Tuesday of the IMF and its sister lending organization, the
World Bank. Its seal of approval is the crucial first step for the
$60 billion increase in capital contributions, known as quotas. The
U.S. share would be about $12 billion.
   The increase faces opposition from members of Congress skeptical
of foreign aid programs, even though the complex treatment of IMF
finances keeps the U.S. contribution from showing up in the budget
deficit.
   At the urging of the United States, the Group of Seven also
agreed to link the quota increase with a plan to deal with the 11
countries which are about $4 billion behind in loan payments to the
IMF.
   Money in a special IMF fund would be used to help the countries
pull their economies up. However, nations in arrears would lose
their voting rights, and gold roughly equivalent to their original
contribution to the IMF could be sold if they did not meet their
obligations.
   The Group of 24, which represents Third World countries, said in
a statement that suspending voting rights ``will not serve a useful
purpose and is not acceptable.''
   Regarding German unification, the Group of Seven said it ``would
contribute to improved non-inflationary global growth and to a
reduction of external imbalances.''
   However, most private economists worry that plans to give the
East German mark equal value in many instances with the West German
mark will add to inflation worldwide, pushing interest rates higher.

   President Bush has agreed with congressional
leaders to set ``no preconditions'' on their effort to negotiate a
bipartisan budget compromise, the White House said today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the talks will be
``unfettered'' by stances from the past, including Bush's
longstanding insistence that there be no new taxes.
   He said new efforts to forge a compromise were motivated in part
by ``anxiety over a deficit that is fighting every reduction
attempt that we can come up with.''
   ``The participants agreed on two or three kind of basic
operating principles. One would be that there are no preconditions,
that anyone can bring up an issue for discussion and debate,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``They agreed that they can't negotiate a budget in public, that
it does take a lot of give and take and moving back and forth, so
we'll try to keep a little mystery in the marriage,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``They will continue the process as long as they believe that it
has a chance of being productive. There are no deadlines,'' he said.
   Asked whether Bush was abandoning his refusal to consider
raising taxes, Fitzwater reke over
investigations in Kashmir. At least 300 people have been killed in
the northwestern state since the government cracked down on a
Moslem separatist movement in January.
   Just south of Kashmir, bureau agents are investigating
separatist violence by Sikh extremists in Punjab state.
   Many Punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks
because they are favorite targets of Sikh extremists, who have
killed more than 5,800 people in Punjab since 1987.
   In Assam, a remote northeastern state, bureau agents are looking
closely at the Bodos, an animist tribe that believes spirits live
in rocks and trees. The Bodos want a separate state within India
and have attacked Assamese Hindus.
   The real work of Shekhar's agency, however, is fighting
corruption.
   India's British colonial rulers established the Central Bureau
of Investigation soon after World War II to investigate links
between Indian businessmen and the government. That work continued
after independence in 1947.
   Of the 1,200 cases filed by the bureau's 3,907 agents every
year, about 1,000 are corruption-related, Shekhar said.
   Corruption is the grease of South Asia's wheels.
   Traffic cops routinely take ``baksheesh,'' small cash payments,
to ignore violations. Businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks
part of the job.
   Shekhar said the problem has been growing.
   Industrialization, inflation, development, unemployment _ all
contribute to it, he said, and ``the facets that give impetus to
corruption are getting more and more pronounced.''
   Preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving
members of Gandhi's government. Two concern alleged payment of
bribes by Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium and
Hawaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a West German submarine manufacturer.
   A former high-level civil servant was charged in connection with
a $1.47 billion Airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense
secretary was named in a case involving four West German subs worth
$334 million.
   The agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a $1.4
billion artillery contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer AB
Bofors. Bureau investigators have charged Bofors with cheating
India out of $37 million and Indian government officials, not
identified, with criminal misconduct.
   Charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign
against the son of Prime Minster Singh are expected soon.
   Western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibily
is a sign local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of
crime in India.
   It also indicates, they say, that the central government does
not trust local officials.
   ``Under these circumstances, it's easy for the law enforcment
process to break down,'' a diplomat said, on condition of
anonymity. ``The bureau is stretched too thin. They don't have good
relations with local police and the crooks keep committing crimes.''
   Critics say many of the bureau's investigations are politically
motivated.
   Charges of corruption haunted the Gandhi administration. Singh,
formerly Gandhi's finance minister, quit the government when his
corruption investigations were stymied.
   Diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the
investigations, and cite the one concerning the prime minister's
son.
   By forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a
minor case, Singh's administration is using law enforcement to
fight its political battles, another Western diplomat said.
   Shekhar denied his bureau could be used for political purposes.
   ``Our work has nothing to with politics,'' he said. ``If we
think the case is legitimate, we investigate.''
   Shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the
investigation of one of India's biggest bank robberies, the theft
of $3.35 million from the Punjab National Bank in 1987.
   Ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead, but Shekhar says
the police didn't kill them.
   Several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and
jailed. In the Indian context, the case was considered a success.
   The director general looks at his current post in a similar
light: Incremental steps can be taken, but no major changes should
be expected.
   ``If we can set an example with one or two corruption cases, I
suppose we are doing our job,'' Shekhar said. ``But, then again,
nobody could pay any attention.''

<HEAD>K-III to Buy Automotive Industry Publisher Ward's Communications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publishing concern K-III Holdings LP said
Monday it has agreed to acquire the assets of Ward's
Communications, which publishes several highly-regarded
publications dealing with the automotive industry.
   Neither K-III nor the seller, Thomson Corp., a Canadian
publishing and information services conglomerate, disclosed terms
of the deal.
   Among Ward's publications are the weekly newsletter Ward's
Automotive Reports, which is widely read within the auto industry
for its news and production statistics.
   It also publishes the monthly magazines Ward's Automotive World
and Ward's Auto Dealer, the biweekly newsletters Ward's Engine
Update and Ward's Automotive International and the annual Ward's
Automotive Yearbook.
   Charles McCurdy, executive vice president of K-III Holdings,
said the purchase was ``part of our continuing program to build the
K-III group of companies through acquisitions and product
development.''
   He said his company has ``no current plans for changes'' at the
Ward's publications, had recently met with the staff and was
pleased with the quality of the publications. He said Ward's was
profitable.
   Thomson, based in Toronto, had put Detroit-based Ward's up for
sale in early March, citing a strategic decision by its information
publishing group. A Thomson spokesman said several parties
expressed interest but declined to say how many bids were received.
   Ward's has been in business since 1924 and was acquired by
Thomson in 1981.
   K-III, which was formed last year by several former executives
of the publishing company Macmillan Inc. and the buyout specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., said it was making the purchase
through its Intertec Publishing Corp. subsidiary.
   Intertec is a publisher of trade magazines and technical books
in the telecommunications, agricultural and industrial fields.
   In addition to Intertec, K-III Holdings owns the Macmillan Book
Clubs Inc., which operates professional books clubs, and K-III
Press Inc., which provides information to the rail, truck and ocean
freight industries.
   K-III Press includes assets of International Thomson Transport
Press Inc., another Thomson subsidiary which K-III Holdings agreed
to buy in January. Terms of that transaction were also not
disclosed.

   The stock market gained ground today as Wall
Street awaited a record-sized offering of government securities
this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 65.31 points last
week, rose 14.87 to 2,725.23 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 910 up, 553 down and
479 unchanged.
   Over three days beginning on Tuesday the Treasury is scheduled

   The mood of stock and bond traders has vacillated as the
quarterly financing operation approaches. At times, fears have
spread that the auction will be poorly received, prompting further
increases in long-term interest rates.
   But those worries lost a little of their edge late last week,
when the Labor Department issued figures showing much
smaller-than-expected employment growth in April.
   The data abruptly silenced talk that the Federal Reserve might
be about to tighten its credit policy.

<HEAD>French, British Firms Reportedly To Develop New Supersonic Plane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The major aerospace companies of France and Britain
will team up to develop a supersonic passenger plane with greater
speed, capacity and range than their existing Concorde, according
to a report published Monday.
   La Tribune, a Paris-based financial newspaper, said the accord
between privately owned British Aerospace PLC and France's
Aerospatiale, which is owned by the government, would be announced
Wednesday.
   Aerospatiale confirmed ``an important agreement'' would be
announced in Paris on Wednesday regarding a new supersonic
airplane, but it declined to give other details.
   The project would cost between $8.5 billion and $13.5 billion,
according to La Tribune. It would require about five years of
research and take eight years to manufacture, the newspaper said.
   International aviation experts agreed that the next generation
of supersonic passenger planes would need to carry at least 200
people at speeds of Mach 2.5, or 2{ times the speed of sound, on
flights up of to 7,460. The Concordes, developed in the mid-1970s,
carry about 110 people at Mach 2, twice the speed of sound, and
have a range of about 3,730 miles.
   Aerospatiale announced Monday that it has agreed to expand
cooperation with the state-controlled Italian group Selenia
Industrie Elettroniche Associate SpA to cover all areas of their
missile operations.
   Aerospatiale said the accord will cover research, development
and joint industrial projects, expanding on a previous accord for
ground-to-air missiles signed in 1988. It said the two groups have
also agreed to study cooperation in the field of satellites.

   The Help-Wanted Index of the Conference Board,
which tracks the volume of employment ads in newspapers, dipped
slightly in March, the business group said Monday.
   The seasonally adjusted index, in which 100 represents 1967,
stood at 139 in March, down from February's 140. The index was 12
points below the year-ago figure of 150.
   ``Although labor demand was softer in March than three months
earlier, it is no longer declining,'' Conference Board economist
Ken Goldstein said. ``The pace of economic activity was strong
enough in the first quarter of 1990 to halt the decline in
help-wanted advertising volume.''
   He said he expected ad volume to pick up in coming months.
   Ad volume registered declines in six of the nine regions of the
country monitored by the business group. The west north central
region recorded the steepest drop, 11 percent. The east south
central and east north central regions posted increases of 4.5
percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.
   The Conference Board surveys help-wanted advertising volume in
51 major newspapers. The group says the ad volume is sensitive to
job market conditions.

   The stock market kept last week's rally going
today as Wall Street awaited a record-sized offering of government
securities this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 65.31 points last
week, rose 17.34 to 2,727.70 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 959 up, 532 down and
476 unchanged.
   Over three days beginning on Tuesday the Treasury is scheduled
to auction $30.5 billion in bonds and notes.
   The mood of stock and bond traders has vacillated as the
quarterly financing operation approaches. At times, fears have
spread that the auction will be poorly received, prompting further
increases in long-term interest rates.
   But those worries lost a little of their edge late last week,
when the Labor Department issued figures showing much
smaller-than-expected employment growth in April.
   The data abruptly silenced talk that the Federal Reserve might
be about to tighten its credit policy.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines gained \

Procter &amp; Gamble 2&lsqb; to 75|.

<HEAD>Atlantic Richfield Profits Off 22 Pct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. reported Monday that
its first quarter profit declined 22 percent over a year ago
despite firmer crude oil prices.
   The oil giant said a big after-tax gain in last year's quarter
and additional provisions for future clean-up costs this year
helped depress its latest results.
   For the first three months of 1990, Arco netted $547 million, or
$3.28 per share, down from earnings of $704 million, or $4 a share,
in 1989. Sales were up 6 percent to $4.21 billion from $3.96
billion.
   Arco said the 1989 quarter included a $634 million after-trax
gain from the initial public offering of Lyondell Petrochemical
Co., although that was partially offset by $345 million in charges
for future environmental and other expenses.
   In this year's quarter, Arco adopted new accounting procedures,
resulting in a $323 million reduction in its deferred tax
liability. However, that was partially offset by $233 million in
charges for expenses such as future clean-ups, it said.
   Excluding those one-time considerations, earnings would have
risen 10 percent, to $457 million from $415 million, due to
improving prices for crude oil and refined products and higher
natural gas sales, Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said.
   After-tax quarterly earnings for worldwide oil and gas
operations rose 64 percent to $319 million from $195 million.
   Arco's average price for domestic crude oil was $14.72 per
42-gallon barrel, up from $11.85 per barrel in the first quarter of
1989.
   Average domestic natural gas prices were $1.89 per thousand
cubic feet, compared with $1.80 in the first quarter of 1989.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government on Monday doubled the price
paid to grain farmers in hopes of stimulating this year's harvest
at the risk of a substantial increase in its budget deficit.
   The price paid for top-quality soft grain will rise from 260
rubles to 500 rubles per ton under Monday's order from the Council
of Ministers, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The price paid for other grains will rise by 30 percent to
nearly 100 percent.
   But while farmers will be paid more to produce animal feed, they
will not be asked to pay higher prices for the feed they buy, the
announcement said.
   That could mean a hefty increase in government subsidies and the
90 billion ruble, or $150 billion, budget deficit. The deficit is
considered a factor in the country's problems with inflation and
extreme shortages of food and consumer goods.
   Farmers who raise their crops without pesticides will be paid a
premium, Tass said. The Soviet Union two years ago awoke to a
severe problem of food contamination due to overuse of agricultural
chemicals.

   Carl Icahn sounded Monday like he expected
USX Corp. shareholders to defeat his plan for splitting up the
steel-energy conglomerate, but he still foresaw an eventual victory
for his campaign to boost its stock price.
   ``We'll stick around to see that (stock) value appreciate,'' the
takeover strategist said USX held its annual meeting. ``We're not
going anywhere.''
   Icahn conceded at the meeting that he might not have the crucial
support of several big institutional investors for his non-binding
proposal to spin off USX's lackluster U.S. Steel subsidiary from
the more robust Marathon Oil Co.
   The takeover strategist, well-known for his forays against
Texaco Inc. and other industrial giants, says the breakup would
boost USX's stock value.
   But in the face of an anticipated defeat, Icahn _ whose 13.3
percent stake in USX makes him the company's largest shareholder _
already had his next move figured out.
   Icahn said he would continue talking with the ``strong nucleus
of shareholders'' who he said agreed that USX management must do
something to improve the company's stock price.
   Icahn said he was unlikely to make a takeover bid for USX
because the company's ``poison pill'' defense limited the number of
shares he could buy.
   Nevertheless, he indicated he expected his restructuring
strategy to win out at USX, as it had at Texaco even though he lost
a fight to win control of that company's management.
   Icahn lost a fight to unseat Texaco's board of directors at the
oil giant's 1988 annual meeting. But several months later, Texaco
management decided to undertake a restructuring _ including the
sales of billions of dollars worth of assets _ that Icahn had
campaigned for as a means of boosting share values.
   ``We were right at Texaco,'' he told reporters Monday.
   Before the USX meeting, observers said Icahn eventually could
force management to restructure aggressively even if his proposal
failed. The company has said it will continue its 10-year-old
restructuring, but management wants to accomplish it on its own
terms.
   There was no surge of support for Icahn apparent at Monday's
gathering. He received polite applause for his comments, but
shareholders who spoke in favor of management and against breaking
up the company got a slightly more enthusiastic hand.
   The three and one-half-hour meeting was attended by some 600
shareholders, most of them individual stockholders and retirees of
USX subsidiaries.
   The meeting largely was uneventful _ the company's biggest
shareholders, the institutional investors, did not speak, and many
already had submitted their proxies. Results of the vote were not
expected for at least a week.
   Icahn got the most support from the crowd when he complained
about the USX stock price, which he contended would improve if U.S.
Steel were spun off and shareholders were issued separate stock for
U.S. Steel and for Marathon.
   The outcome of Monday's vote was being watched as an indicator
of how much strength takeover strategists have in the 1990s, now
that the debt-financed takeover boom has ended.
   In March, takeover strategist Harold Simmons lost a proxy fight
that sought to remove the board of directors at Lockheed Corp. The
biggest winners in that battle were institutional investors who
extracted concessions from Lockheed management.

<HEAD>USX Takes Over Junior High For Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FINDLAY, OHIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a typical Monday morning at Central
Junior High School. Athletes pounded the boards in the gymnasium
and sewing machines hummed in home economics classes.
   But the assembly in the school auditorium wasn't a gathering of
seventh- or eighth-graders. The 600 people who packed the room were
shareholders of USX Corp.
   It was the first time Central Junior High hosted an annual
meeting, USX spokesmen said. But the school was ready for its
visitors.
   In addition to the auditorium, school officials turned over
their board room, which was used by reporters as a press center,
and the school cafeteria, which provided hot dogs for the
journalists' lunch.
   Reporters wandering through the basement, past the cafeteria and
lockers said they had a sense of deja vu.
   Of course, this all begs the question, what were they doing in a
junior high school, and what were they doing in Findlay?
   Easy: It was the only place with enough space to handle the
crowd, and Findlay is home to Marathon Oil Co., one of USX's
biggest subsidiaries.
   USX also was well-organized, with an army of security officers
and ushers inside the school, and attendants guiding cars to
parking spaces.
   The 3{-hour meeting was orderly and cordial, despite the
presence on the agenda of a proposal by takeover strategist Carl
Icahn to break up the steel-and-energy conglomerate.
   However, one shareholder, Peter Rosko of Minneapolis, used
Icahn's proposal to make a few jabs at USX management.
   Icahn has contended his plan would give shareholders a higher
price for their stock. Rosko asked USX Chairman Charles A. Corry
what the USX stock price would be in 1992 if Icahn's plan was
rejected.
   Corry responded that he did not know, and Rosko later laughed as
he told a reporter, ``I was simply goading him.''
   Most of the shareholders at the meeting were individual
stockholders, and most of these appeared to be retirees who make
regular appearances at such corporate sessions.
   One shareholder, who did not give his name, stood up toward the
end of the meeting and complimented Corry for his handling of his
first stockholder gathering. Corry succeeded David M. Roderick as
USX chairman last June.

<HEAD>Offers Guarantees to Business Travelers, Reduces Childrens' Fares</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Monday announced a money-back
guarantee to business travelers and sharply reduced fares for
children on some flights, in the latest bid to attract passengers
to the rebuilding carrier.
   Martin Shugrue, the court-appointed trustee running Eastern,
said travelers buying certain tickets could get their money back if
they are for any reason unhappy with the flight. The fares are
geared to business travelers.
   Shugrue also said that summer fares for children to nine Florida
cities would be $39 on peak days and $29 on other days. Normally,
children pay standard fares.
   Eastern has tried a variety of promotions in recent months in an
attempt to bounce back from more than a year of financial
difficulties related to the strike that pushed the airline into
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   The Miami-based airline, whose largest hub is in Atlanta,
expects to lose $330 million this year and has been operating at 65
percent to 70 percent capacity on its flights.
   Delta Air Lines and American Airlines said Monday they were
reviewing Eastern's offers but indicated they are not likely to
match them.
   ``Delta's position is you have to charge what it costs to
produce the service, or you go out of business,'' spokesman Bill
Berry said. ``What we've got to look at it is, `Does it make sense
to match a fare that's totally unrealistic?'''
   Eastern's announcement followed its recent introduction of
``Y-Not'' reduced rates for passengers who purchase first-class
seats.
   Shugrue was named last month by a federal judge in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York to operate Eastern during its
reorganization. He said he was not concerned the rash of special
offers would be viewed by the public as desperation moves.
   ``I think that prior to the change in control, perhaps there was
a feeling in the marketplace that Eastern wasn't long for this
world ...,'' Shugrue told a news conference at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport.
   ``Obviously what I'm trying to do is to put that to rest. We are
here. We've got plenty of cash available to us to fund our
operation while we go through the reorganization process,'' he said.
   Shugrue shed little new light on plans for guiding Eastern
through reorganization. Labor talks are continuing with pilots and
the striking Machinists union, he said.
   Shugrue's appointment as trustee stripped control of Eastern
from Frank Lorenzo, whose Texas Air Corp. still owns the airline.

<HEAD>Riney Ad Agency Resigns Remaining Perrier Assignments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hal Riney &amp; Partners, fired in late March as the
advertising agency for the Perrier sparkling water brand, has
resigned as the agency for several other brands handled by Perrier
Group of America Inc.
   John Yost, an executive of the San Francisco-based ad agency, on
Monday confirmed published reports that Riney had quit the
Arrowhead, Zephyrhills, Ozarka and Calistoga bottled water accounts
last week.
   He said the four brands spent about $8 million last year on
advertising. That is roughly what Perrier Group said it spent on
advertising the Perrier brand as well last year.
   ``It was clear they were breaking up their business into a lot
of smaller pieces,'' Yost said. ``And it became clear we were not
going to be able to negotiate a satisfactory compensation
agreement.''
   The moves come just weeks after Perrier was reintroduced in the
United States following a February recall. Some bottles of the
trendy and expensive import were tainted with traces of benzene,
believed to cause cancer when ingested in large doses.
   Perrier Group spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said no plans had yet been
made to find a new agency for the four brands. She said Riney would
continue to service the accounts until mid-summer.
   She said one reason Riney may have left is that Perrier plans to
consolidate media buying for all 10 of its bottled water brands at
one agency. That would give it greater clout than several agencies
buying media for one of two brands at a time.
   But such an arrangement may mean less compensation for agencies
that do only the creative work without being responsible for
arranging media placements.
   Lazgin said Perrier has not yet decided which agency would
handle media buying, but said spending on all 10 brands should
amount to about $25 million a year.
   In addition to Perrier and the four brands handled by Riney,
Perrier Group distributes Poland Spring, Volvic, Oasis, Great Bear
and Ice Mountain water.
   Perrier Group, based in Greenwich, Conn., awarded the Perrier
brand assignment to Waring &amp; LaRosa Inc., a New York-based ad
agency, on March 28, several weeks before the re-launch.
   Riney had created the campaign that used the slogan ``It's
perfect. It's Perrier'' for the Perrier brand and had worked on
various Perrier Group brands for about five years.
   Waring &amp; LaRosa had formerly worked on Perrier advertising,
creating the slogan ``Earth's first soft drink'' for the brand in
the mid-1980s.

<TEXT>
   Playboy Enterprises Inc. on Monday unveiled a
recapitalization plan aimed at helping the company finance
acquisitions and other activities without diluting the controlling
stake of founder Hugh Hefner.
   The recapitalization, subject to shareholder approval, would
establish two classes of common stock, including a new class of
non-voting stock. It would increase the number of outstanding
Playboy shares from 15 million to 37.5 million, including 30
million shares of non-voting stock, the company said.
   The plan would not dilute the holdings of Hefner, who owns 70.6
percent of the current outstanding common shares and said he would
vote to approve the plan.
   Under its present structure, Playboy could not raise money by
selling additional common stock without making the stake held by
Hefner, who is chairman emeritus and Playboy magazine editor in
chief, relatively smaller.
   ``We believe that the proposed recapitalization will provide
Playboy with increased flexibility to use equity in future
acquisitions, financings, and employee benefit plans without
diluting the voting power of existing stockholders,'' said Christie
Hefner, Playboy's chairman and chief executive officer, in a
telephone interview.
   Playboy stock rose 12{ cents to $12.87{ a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Under the plan, Playboy stockholders will receive half of a
Class A voting share for each of their current Playboy shares,
followed by a dividend of three non-voting Class B shares for each
of the Class A shares their received in the split.
   The recapitalization includes a ``minority protection'' feature
designed to help ensure that the two classes of stock trade at
approximately equal market prices, Ms. Hefner said. The provision
requires that anyone wanting to buy a specific voting position of
the Class A voting stock must buy a proportionate amount of the
non-voting shares.
   Some industry analysts said the plan, already adopted by
Playboy's board of directors, reflects the publishing and video
company's renewed financial vigor.
   Playboy last week reported net income of $554,000 for its third
fiscal quarter, up from from $262,000 a year earlier. For the nine
months ended March 31, net income was $6 million, including a $4.8
million gain on the sale of the assets of its Boarts International
Inc. subsidiary, compared with $2.2 million in the year-earlier
period.
   ``I really see the recap as another building block, that having
established a base of profitability ... we now are looking ahead to
the '90s with an eye to expanding internationally in both
publishing and entertainment, and doing that with other
companies,'' said Ms. Hefner.
   After succeeding with the ``Playboy Late Night'' television
series in Europe, Playboy has begun talks with foreign and domestic
production companies about possibly co-producing television
programs, Ms. Hefner said.
   Playboy is the sole producer of ``Playboy Late Night,'' a weekly
television magazine-format series that debuted in France last
September and now appers in 10 countries.
   Playboy also is talking with potential publishing partners about
forming an alliance similar to its link with duPont Publishing,
Inc., she said. Playboy in 1988 acquired a 20 percent interest in
the publisher of the duPont Registry, a monthly magazine for car
buffs.
   Buzz Zaino, an industry analyst and managing director of Trust
Co. of the West in New York, said the recapitalization will help
Playboy make similar deals.
   ``It does provide her the flexibilty to expand the business with
the use of stock, either by selling stock in a public offering or
using the stock to acquire other business,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anticipated Export Business Boosts Grain, Soybean Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as expectation of additional export sales
fueled buying interest.
   On other markets, energy futures were higher, precious metals
prices rose, copper futures retreated, and livestock and pork
futures advanced.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 5} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.83 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3{ cents
higher with May at $2.90} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents
higher with May at $1.68 a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents to 11
cents higher with May at $6.37 a bushel.
   Trading opened Monday with prices down across the board in a
follow through to Friday's negative close. But investor fund buying
set in at mid-morning when the lower prices failed to trigger heavy
selling.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said soybean prices were helped by an anticipated surge in
export business. He said there are indications the Soviet Union may
enter the market for 150,000 to 200,000 metric tons of soymeal.
   The sharp rise in soybean prices came despite weekend progress
in the harvest of the South American soybean crop. But even with
the surge in harvest activity, the export pace remains slight,
analysts said.
   The strength of soybean prices helped boost corn futures. Corn
prices also were helped by expectations that the Soviet Union may
buy more corn.
   After the close of trading Monday, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture announced the sale of 1.75 million metric tons of corn
to the Soviet Union. On Friday, the USDA announced the Soviets
purchased 600,000 metric tons of corn.
   Wheat prices were higher, with traders anticipating the
Agriculture Department will offer export bonus terms to several
foreign countries, Karlin said.
   Livestock and pork futures surged on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Pork futures climbed on higher than expected cash hog prices and
expectations that prices would continue rising Tuesday. Hog
movement from farms to market has been curbed as farmers
concentrate on planting corn.
   Livestock futures rose on commission house buying stemming from
higher cash prices at the wholesale level.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .55 cent higher with June at 75.20
a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .80 cent higher with May at
84.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to 1 cent higher with
June at 64.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to
1.40 cents higher with May at 70.30 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures closed higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange, with both metals trading in a narrow range.
   Gold prices largely were influenced by the weakness in the
dollar against other currencies. Silver prices followed the action
in gold.
   Gold was 90 cents to $1.20 higher with June at $374 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 1.6 cents higher with May at $5.016
a troy ounce.
   Comex copper prices fell due to a late round of commission house
selling.
   Helping to push prices lower was Friday's news that the strike
at the Southern Peru Copper Corp. mine has been settled, said Craig
Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Copper was 1.60 cents to 1.80 cents lower with May at $1.1172 a
pound.
   Energy futures closed higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Robert Baker, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in
New York, said the market reacted positively to Friday's official
statement by the Saudi Arabian government endorsing the pledge by
OPEC oil ministers to reduce their combined output by 1.5 million
barrels a day.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 9 cents to 29 cents higher
with June at $18.27 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to .50 cent
higher with June at 50.44 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45
cent to .74 cent higher with June at 61.86 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Monday against most major
currencies due to a stronger West German mark and continuing
concern over the U.S. unemployment rate.
   Gold prices strengthened. Gold rose $1 a troy ounce to $371.90
on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $371.70, up 40 cents from late Friday.
   Traders said the currency market continued to feel the effects
of Friday's unemployment report, which showed the jobless rate rose
from 5.2 percent in March to 5.4 percent in April, the highest rate
in over a year.
   Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services at
Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said the unemployment report
``was not only weak, but it raises the question of whether we're
seeing a slowdown in the service sector.''
   The report sparked concern that the Federal Reserve would be
reluctant to let interest rates rise due to the signs of economic
weakness. Hodge said interest rates, which have risen in recent
weeks, have been a prime supporting factor for the value of the
dollar.
   Higher interest rates tend to make the dollar more valuable
relative to other currencies.
   Hodge said the mark rose relative to most other currencies after
officials of East and West Germany gave assurances that the
upcoming merger of the monetary systems of the two nations would
not disrupt financial markets or be excessively inflationary.
   The mark also continued to be boosted by the settlement of a
West German metalworkers union contract Friday that was viewed as
less inflationary than many observers feared, he said.
   In Europe, where London markets were closed for a holiday, the
dollar fell against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6710, more
expensive than $1.6595 late Friday. In in New York, the pound cost
$1.6685, up from $1.6635 late Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to close at 157.80 yen.
Later, in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 157.55 yen. In New York
trading, the dollar bought 158.15 yen, down from 158.30 yen late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.6556 West German marks, down from 1.6660; 1.4310 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4430; 5.5615 French francs, down from 5.5930;
1,214.50 Italian lire, down from 1,221.00; and 1.1633 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1629.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.6550 West German marks, down from 1.6710; 1.4320 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4435; 5.5555 French francs, down from 5.6060;
1.8590 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8782; 1,213.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,224.50; and 1.1617 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1630.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $371.70, up from
$371.00 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 34 cents to close at a
bid $373.10.
   Silver prices also rose. Silver for current delivery traded at
$5.016 a troy ounce from $5.00 late Friday on the Commodity
Exchange. London silver trading was closed due to the holiday.

<HEAD>Rise on News of Shutdown in Gulf of Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices rose late Monday, strengthened by
word that an important pipeline feed from Gulf of Mexico platforms
off the Louisiana coast had been shut down because of a suspected
leak.
   Traders said the shutdown raised the prospect of shortages for a
quality grade of oil extracted from the area just as the oil
industry is preparing for higher demand from the impending summer
driving season. They said there was little other external news
affecting the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June-contract price of
the key West Texas Intermediate crude rose 29 cents a barrel to
$18.27 after trading in a narrow range through much of the day.
Later contract month prices also finished higher.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for June delivery rose .59 cent a gallon to 50.44
cents. Subsequent contract months also rose.
   The June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.56 cent
a gallon to 61.68 cents, while later contract months finished
higher as well.
   Natural gas for June delivery finished at $1.580 per million
British Thermal Units, vs. its $1.575 closing price Friday.
Subsequent months were mixed.
   Traders speculated the Eugene Island Pipeline System off
Louisiana could affect as much as 120,000 barrels of production per
day, aggravating previously existing shortages in that area. The
pipeline is operated by Texaco Inc. and is owned jointly by six
major oil companies.

   The stock market forged ahead Monday, extending
last week's rally as Wall Street awaited a record-sized offering of
government securities.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 65.31 points last
week, rose another 11.26 to 2,721.62.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
943 up, 571 down and 493 unchanged.
   Over three days beginning on Tuesday the Treasury is scheduled
to auction $30.5 billion in bonds and notes.
   The mood of stock and bond traders has vacillated as the
quarterly financing operation approaches. At times, fears have
spread that the auction will be poorly received, prompting further
increases in long-term interest rates.
   But those worries lost a little of their edge late last week,
when the Labor Department issued figures showing much
smaller-than-expected employment growth in April.
   The data abruptly silenced talk that the Federal Reserve might
be about to tighten its credit policy.
   Some financial and utility issues continued to benefit from more
optimistic views of the interest-rate outlook. Dow Jones's average
of 15 utilities rose 2.13 to 210.51, for a 1 percent advance that
more than doubled the industrials' percentage gain.
   Columbia Gas System rose } to 47\; Pacificorp \ to 22&lsqb;;
Philadelphia Electric \ to 16; Peoples Energy { to 22\, and Niagara
Mohawk Power \ to 12~.
   In the financial sector, Federal National Mortgage rose { to 35&rsqb;
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage, which reported higher first-quarter
earnings, gained } to 67&rsqb;.
   Among the blue-chip industrials, Digital Equipment climbed { to
88{; General Motors { to 46\; Bristol-Myers Squibb | to 57; General
Electric { to 65~, and Procter &amp; Gamble 1{ to 75.
   Universal Matchbox, up 1 at 5\, posted the day's biggest
percentage advance. The company declined to comment on the activity.
   Suave Shoe rose } to 7. Earnings from continuing operations came
to 44 cents a share in the first quarter, against 16 cents in the
like period last year.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 132.76 million
shares, against 140.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 160.89 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $18.32 billion, or
0.57 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.07 to 186.45.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.34 to 396.54, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.14 at 340.53.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.62 to 431.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 347.33, up 1.60.

   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. said
Monday that new convertibles will not be introduced until after the
prime spring buying season for the cars.
   Company spokesmen said vehicle quality was below a desired
level, but they did not elaborate.
   Chevrolet spokesman Ralph Kramer said it is unlikely that GM
will market any 1990 Chevrolet Beretta convertibles, which had been
forecast to account for about 5,000 in sales this year.
   Dodge spokesman Scott Sweeney said the introduction of a 1991
Dodge Shadow convertible would be delayed by six to eight weeks,
until late summer.
   Kramer declined to discuss the problems, but said they occurred
after the cars were assembled as hardtops at GM's Wilmington, Del.,
plant and then taken to C&amp;C Inc., based in Brighton, for conversion
into convertibles.
   Such an arrangement is not unusual for manufacturing
convertibles.
   Chrysler builds the Dodge Shadow in Toluca, Mexico, and converts
the cars to convertibles there. The cars are then brought into the
United States for sale. Chrysler also builds Shadows at its
Sterling Heights factory.

   Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. said Monday it
is extending until May 11 the deadline for its offer to buy back
$159 million in high-yield junk bonds.
   No shares were tendered by the previous May 4 deadline, said
Stanley J. Kay, vice president of Dewe Rogerson Inc., a financial
public relations firm representing Ingersoll.
   Terms of the deal were unchanged.
   Ingersoll has offered to buy back up to 80 percent of $125
million worth of bonds for 55 cents on the dollar. It also would
pay 25 cents on the dollar for 51 percent of $115 million in bonds
that won't start paying interest until June 1991.
   The bonds, issued at 13 percent interest, have been selling at
40 cents on the dollar. The reset provision would require Ingersoll
to raise the interest rate on June 30 that the bonds would sell at
$1.01.
   Ingersoll owns 19 daily newspapers. Analysts say the company is
under pressure of a June 30 deadline to reset its interest rate to
restore the value of the notes to face amount.

<TEXT>
   The new director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision on Monday appointed a lawyer with little direct
experience in the savings and loan industry as the agency's top
attorney.
   In his first appointment since taking office a month ago, thrift
supervision director Timothy Ryan named Harris Weinstein, 54, as
chief counsel. Weinstein will be in charge of nearly 200 lawyers
and support staff.
   Since 1971, he has been a partner in the Washington law firm
Covington &amp; Burling, which he joined in 1962. Although he has
little background in the thrift business, he has extensive
experience in financial matters.
   He was one of the lead attorneys in his firm's representation of
the then bankrupt Penn Central Railroad. From 1967 to 1969, he was
the assistant to the solicitor general of the United States in
charge of tax matters.
   Ryan, whose background is in pension and employee benefit law,
also has been criticized for his lack of expertise in savings and
loans. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 5 over the
objections of 37 Democrats.
   In a statement, Ryan said he regarded Weinstein ``as one of the
most astute lawyers I've ever met'' and said he ``has attained a
high degree of skill in financial matters.''

<HEAD>FDIC Director Responds To Keating Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Charles Keating Jr. is ``full
of baloney'' to say that bungling by federal regulators led to the
collapse of his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the nation's
top thrift regulator said Monday.
   ``Mr. Keating took the view that regulators ought to stick their
nose out of his business without recognizing that 97 percent of his
assets were guaranteed by the federal government,'' said William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He said any assertion that the thrift industry's problems can be
traced to heavy-handed or incompetent regulation ``is way off the
mark.''
   ``He's just full of baloney,'' Seidman said of Keating.
   Seidman, who also heads the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal
agency created to oversee the sale of failed savings and loans, met
Monday with two local RTC advisory committees and addressed the
National Council of Savings Institutions.
   The advisory boards passed a resolution urging the RTC to speed
up disposals of seized savings and loan properties.
   ``It is clear to us that Arizona is poised on the recovery of
its real-estate market,'' said Hank Rivoir, superintendent of the
state Banking Department and chairman of the two committees. ``All
that is missing is a track record of sales by the RTC.''
   Seidman acknowledged there have been delays but said the RTC's
``essential job'' is to market the properties it has seized.
   He said the market for failed institutions ``is very limited''
and that the agency generally has not been able to sell them as
``whole and going'' operations.
   ``The next step is to take the institutions apart and sell them
by parts,'' he said.
   The resolution passed by the advisory boards called on the RTC
to come up with alternatives to appraisals as a means of selling
thrift assets _ including options such as public auctions and
acceptance of sealed bids _ to eliminate the backlog of real estate
awaiting sale in Arizona.
   The committees also called on Seidman to move quickly to appoint
a director of the RTC's Phoenix field office.
   Seidman told reporters that several candidates are being
interviewed and someone would be appointed ``before too many more
weeks.''
   Responding to reporters' questions about the seizure of Lincoln
S&amp;L last year, Seidman said ``the inevitable happened'' after the
thrift experienced three or four years of explosive growth and
invested its profits in high-risk enterprises.
   He said the RTC has run into numerous difficulties with the
thrift since the seizure and he blamed those problems on Keating,
saying Keating had ``carefully constructed'' Lincoln as a ``series
of bankrupt subsidiaries of a bankrupt holding company.''
   ``It has been slow and difficult because it was set up to be
that way,'' Seidman said.
   Asked about Keating's claim that federal regulators improperly
wrote down the value of its assets, Seidman said that if Keating
can sell those assets for what he claims they are worth, ``we'll
give him a commission.''

<HEAD>Douglas Managers Too Permissive, Air Force Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force official said permissive
managers are contributing to widespread production problems at
Douglas Aircraft Co., including instances where tools and stray
parts have been left inside finished planes.
   Col. Kenneth Tollefson, the Air Force's top representative at
the company, said separately that the many contractor deficiency
reports issued by his office suggest Douglas' problems are
widespread.
   Douglas, a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St. Louis, lost
$84 million last quarter and has begun eliminating 3,000
white-collar jobs in an attempt to rein in costs. Major programs
include the MD-80 and MD-11 passenger jets and the C-17 military
cargo jet.
   Air Force officials have issued 34 deficiency reports against
the C-17 program and also have written more serious ``letters of
concern'' to senior Douglas executives, the Los Angeles Times
reported Monday.
   The reports and letters of concern are issued when the Air Force
finds a company out of compliance with regulations or beset with
serious problems that affect cost, schedule or product performance.
   The Times also said it had obtained a memo from Douglas
President John Capellupo that criticized a lack of discipline among
white-collar and blue-collar workers.
   The memo said Douglas' ``total quality management'' program,
instituted during a reorganization last year to encourage worker
participation, had led to a ``permissive'' system.
   The Air Force's Tollefson agreed in an article in Douglas'
employee newsletter.
   ``The lack of leadership, which includes the failure to
recognize the difference between participative and permissive
management, is the biggest problem facing Douglas Aircraft Co.,''
he wrote.
   The C-17 is at least 10 months behind schedule and is now
expected to fly in June 1991. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last
week recommended slicing $11.9 billion from the $41.8 billion C-17
program by cutting back the number of planes to be produced from
210 to 120.
   Douglas spokesman Don Hanson acknowledged the program has had
problems but said the company is striving to correct them.
   ``If you look around, you find that most contractors have some
outstanding contractor deficiency reports on any program at any
given time,'' he said. ``The objective is to have none, but since
we are human there are some.''
   One problem involves stray parts, tools and other foreign
objects left in planes. Air Force officials bagged and sent to
senior Douglas officials 40 pounds of such objects left inside the
wing of one C-17, the Times reported.
   On at least one occasion, the C-17 line had to be shut down to
clean up debris, the newspaper said. Now, the production line is
vacuumed at the end of each shift.

   A group of Nevada businessmen said they have
signed an agreement with the Soviet government to bring blackjack
to the Black Sea.
   Simon Furman, general manager of Uniquad, said the company plans
to spend about $1 million to open four casinos in existing hotels.
The casinos will include ``Las Vegas'' in their name, he said.
   The first casino will have six or eight table games and 35 to 50
slot machines. It is expected to open this summer in the Dagomys
Hotel in Sochi, a popular Soviet resort on the Black Sea, Furman
said.
   Two other casinos are planned at resorts near Moscow and another
is to be opened on the Black Sea.
   ``The foreign business climate has changed in the Soviet
Union,'' Furman said last week. ``We think the casinos will do
well.''
   Furman said Uniquad plans to split profits from the casinos
50-50 with the Soviet government. The company said it will get part
of its profits in hard currency and part in rubles, which aren't
convertible into Western currencies.
   A former Nevada lieutenant governor, Cliff Jones, is a
consultant to the corporation and will supply management teams for
the casinos. He said several people with experience in gaming
operations will travel to the Soviet Union to help open the casinos.

<HEAD>Central Bank Chief Forecasts Surplus Decline Buttressed by
Stability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan sought to assure world financial leaders
Monday that its stock and money markets are sound and it will
continue efforts to cut its huge trade surplus.
   ``There was no major movement of capital out of the stock and
bond markets despite this uneasiness'' over sharp market declines
earlier this year, Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan,
told the 22-nation interim committee of the International Monetary
Fund.
   ``There has been no change in the basic soundness of Japan's
fundamentals,'' the central bank chief said. ``In fact, the markets
are now considerably more stable than they were earlier this year.''
   The key index of the Tokyo stock market plunged more than 25
percent early this year as interest rates shot up and the yen lost
roughly 10 percent of its value against the dollar.
   The stock market has stabilized in recent weeks and the index
has rebounded more than 10 percent from its low.
   Mieno also said he is ``confident that the current account
surplus will continue to come steadily down,'' provided the yen
doesn't weaken further. The yen's decline has made Japanese exports
cheaper and imports more expensive.
   The current account surplus should be reduced by a combination
of strong growth in Japan's domestic demand and promotion of
adjustments such as expanding overseas production by Japanese
firms, he said.
   But ``realizing that the yen's depreciation may well put a
damper on such promotion of adjustments, I believe it is important
for the exchange rate of the yen to be stabilized in such a way
that better reflects Japan's economic fundamentals,'' Mieno said,
in effect advocating a stronger yen.
   Mieno told a news conference Sunday he is not advocating a
specific yen-dollar exchange rate but would prefer some
strengthening of Japan's currency.
   Japan's current account surplus fell from $79.7 billion in 1988
to $57.2 billion last year, or 2 percent of gross national product,
he said.
   The world economic ``outlook is for continued firm growth,''
Mieno said. Still, there will be a slight decline in the growth
rate this year, he predicted, adding that the sweeping change in
East Europe and German unification have brought ``unprecedented

   The sudden need for massive new investment in Europe along with
continued capital for the Third World makes it imperative for
``industrial countries as a whole to increase their savings to
prevent a global upsurge in interest rates and to support sustained
global economic development,'' Mieno said.

<HEAD>Prices in Third World Rose Record 86.3 Percent in 1989</HEAD>

   Consumer prices rose a record 86.3 percent on
average in the Third World last year, spurred by a 350 percent rise
in Latin America, the International Monetary Fund reported Monday.
   Among 22 industrial countries prices rose 4.5 percent, up from
the 3.4 percent of 1988. The increases ranged from 1.1 percent in
the Netherlands to 20.8 percent in Iceland. Japan had 2.3 percent
and West Germany 2.8 percent.
   The United States, the world's largest economy, was a little
above the average at 4.8 percent.
   The fund gets figures from its member countries but calculates
on its own basis to make them comparable, so rates for individual
countries sometimes differ from those published by governments
themselves.
   Latin American average prices were influenced heavily by runaway
inflation in two of the area's most important countries: Argentina,
which had inflation of 3,079 percent, and Brazil at 1,287 percent.
The Argentine figures meant the price of a basket of goods rose 30
times during the course of the year.
   Peru had an even higher inflation rate of 3,398 percent.
   Mexico, which has adopted a strict austerity program, saw its
inflation rate drop to 20 percent from 114 percent in 1988.
   The fund classifies 130 of its members as ``developing
countries,'' including those in eastern Europe. The Soviet Union
does not belong and the fund gives no figures for it.
   For its seven European members outside the industrial group, the
inflation rate rose in 1989 to an average 232 percent. The average
reflected Yugoslavia's 1,239 percent inflation rate and Poland's
rate of 244 percent.
   A fund official said Poland's inflation rate has dropped sharply
this year because of the new non-communist government's shock
program to shift away from central planning to a market system. The
program has abolished subsidies and cut back government spending.
   Annual figures for Africa and the Middle East were incomplete.
Many Middle East countries have not been reporting in recent years.
Among those that have, Israel's inflation rate rose to 20.2 percent
last year from 16.3 percent in 1988, and Egypt's rose to 21.3
percent from 17.7 percent.
   Africa's average appeared steady: 18.9 percent in 1988 and 21.2
percent in the third quarter of 1989. The African average masked a
wide range, from Zambia's annual 186 percent rate last October to
small price reductions in several countries including Chad, Togo
and the Central African Republic.
   Only Asia showed a decline in the inflation rate. For 21
countries in that region the annual average inflation rate dropped
to 10.2 percent last year from 11.8 percent in 1988.
   China's rate declined to 16.3 percent from 20.7 percent and
India's also was falling, from 9.4 percent in 1988 to an annual
rate of 6.2 percent in the third quarter of 1989.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Monday proposed
changes in antitrust law that would relax restrictions on joint
production ventures between U.S. companies to produce new
technologies.
   The measure, intended to enable U.S. companies to better compete
in the global marketplace, would reduce the amount of damages that
plaintiffs in antitrust suits could collect from companies involved
in the joint ventures.
   The legislation, unveiled by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, would also require courts
to consider the effects of a joint venture on competition in
foreign as well as domestic markets when determining if there is an
antitrust violation.
   Antitrust restrictions on joint research and development
ventures were relaxed by Congress in 1984. The administration bill
would extend the concept to joint production ventures.
   The bill would ``help U.S. firms face unprecedented, worldwide
challenges by bringing important research from the laboratory to
the marketplace efficiently, cost effectively and with less risk,''
Mosbacher said in a statement.
   Under the proposal, plaintiffs could not collect treble damages
from an antitrust judgment against companies that participate in a
cooperative joint venture. The bill would allow plaintiffs to
collect only the money they lost as a result of the
anti-competitive practice.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the proposal was
unnecessary and could be harmful.
   ``I say to the president, show me which deals are being lost due
to fears of antitrust suits,'' Metzenbaum said.
   ``The real reason American companies are falling behiond is
because they have been too busy trying to devour the competition
with mergers, LBOs (leveraged buyouts, or management takeovers with
borrowed money) and hostile takeovers.''

<HEAD>Ex-Northrop Employees May Continue With Parts of Suit Government
Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has allowed two former
Northrop Corp. employees to proceed with portions of their lawsuit
against the defense firm that the Justice Department declined to
include when joining the suit.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's ruling Monday means former
Northrop manager David Peterson and engineer Jeff Kroll can pursue
claims that could net them as much as $60 million in damages, said
attorney Phillip E. Benson.
   ``It's a novel issue ... and precedent-setting,'' Benson said.
   Peterson and Kroll allege in their ``whistleblower'' suit that
Northrop committed more than $100 million in fraud in the
production of the MX missile guidance systems.
   The suit accuses the firm of falsifying tests and mischarging
the government for tests and parts used in the Inertial Measurement
Units on the missile, which are vital parts in the guidance systems.
   The Justice Department announced last year it was picking up
``substantial portions'' of the suit. Northrop had sought to
dismiss the claims that the government declined to join.
   Those remaining claims involved specific instances of alleged
mischarging and test falsification.
   But Kenyon said Monday the former employees ``will be permitted
to pursue the claims which were not adopted by the government,''
even though those claims will be dropped from the joint
government-employee lawsuit.
   Kenyon said he would call another hearing to determine whether
the severed claims could be included in a separate lawsuit.
   Northrop attorneys declined to comment.
   In related rulings, Kenyon rejected Northrop's contention the
employees' lawsuit was unconstitutional, but he agreed with the
company that the government failed to be specific enough in
alleging wrongdoing.
   The judge gave the government 30 days to file a tighter version
of the suit.

<HEAD>Trio Indicted; Face Arraignment Tuesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street broker, his lawyer brother and a
third man have been indicted on federal charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice stemming from a $1.7 million embezzlement
scheme, prosecutors said.
   A grand jury last week indicted the trio and a fourth individual
in a case that prosecutors say dates back to 1980 and involved
attempts to conceal both the laundering of checks and income tax
evasion.
   The indictment was announced by the U.S. attorney's office
Monday and the men are scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.
   The checks, according to the indictment, represented about $1.6
million that had been embezzled from Bankers Trust Co. by other
individuals, plus nearly $95,000 in stock loan fees.
   Three people pleaded guilty previously to the embezzlement and
were given probation, said Jeff Fardella, assistant U.S. attorney.
The new defendants are accused of having tried to obstruct that
investigation, in part by falsely claiming that dead or
non-existent persons had been the source of the money.
   Named in the indictment are Joseph J. Stella, a former vice
president and manager of the stock loan department of Bear Stearns
&amp; Co. Inc., his brother Fred C. Stella, a lawyer, and Roger C.
Capozzi Sr.
   The indictment charges all three with one count of conspiracy to
obstruct justice. In addition, Fred Stella was charged with five
counts of obstructing justice, and Capozzi with three counts of
perjury and three counts of obstructing justice.
   The fourth defendant, Joseph A. Pontarelli Jr., was accused of
income tax evasion and filing a false tax return, according to
Fardella.
   Bear Stearns was not involved in the case.

<HEAD>Doctors' Group Asks Nutri-System To Stop Using Its Name</HEAD>

   The American Medical Association said it has
asked Nutri-System Inc. to stop using the AMA's name in advertising
for the weight loss program, a recent target of lawsuits by people
claiming health problems.
   ``The American Medical Association does not endorse that
company's or any other diet plans,'' an AMA statement said Monday.
   Neither the AMA nor Nutri-System could provide details about the
ads, though AMA spokesman John Hammarly said he believed the ads
began in February and ran in both broadcast and print media.
   Commercially administered weight-loss programs should be
``appropriate for the individual's physical condition,'' says an
AMA report on treating obesity in adults drafted two years ago by
the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs.
   The report, which the AMA cited in its statement, says such
programs should offer proper medical supervision ``by physicians
who have knowledge of the metabolic consequences of the prescribed
regimen.''
   ``The AMA is thus particularly concerned by recent published
reports alleging a failure of proper medical supervision in
connection with the Nutri-System program,'' the AMA said in a May 4
letter to Nutri-System.
   Nineteen women in Florida filed separate lawsuits against
Nutri-System earlier this year alleging they were inadequately
supervised under the program and that it caused them to develop
gallstones. Most required gallbladder surgery. The gallbladder
produces and stores bile used in digestion.
   The company has said the lawsuits are without merit, suggesting
that the gallstones in the plaintiffs occurred coincidentally and
that the risk of gallbladder disease among the obese can be reduced
by prudent dieting.
   Nonetheless, ``Nutri-System has complied with the AMA's
request,'' said Tim Hermeling, a spokesman for Nutri-System in
Willow Grove, Pa.
   ``We are reviewing the letter,'' he added. ``Nutri-system meets
the guidelines of all leading health organizations. And we'd be
pleased to discuss the issue with the AMA.''
   The AMA also notified U.S. Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of a
congressional subcommittee holding hearings on the nation's $33
billion annual weight-loss industry, that it had asked Nutri-System
to leave the AMA out of its advertising.
   Nutri-System, with nearly 1,600 weight-loss centers in all 50
states, Canada, Britain and Australia, offers a 1,000-to
1,500-calorie-a-day meal program that can cost several hundred
dollars to enroll in, depending on wight-loss goals and special
promotions offered.

<HEAD>Survey of 50 Companies Finds Potential $14 Billion Pension
Shortfall</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, bgng: The agency xxx to CORRECT employer to

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of 50 companies with pension plans
underfunded by $40 million or more each shows those corporations
together have a potential $14 billion shortfall, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. said Monday.
   James Lockhart, director of the agency, said the firms on the
list were not necessarily in poor financial health. He also said
their inclusion did not mean they had failed to properly fund their
pension plans.
   Guaranteed benefits earned by participants in the plans are
still secure because the funds' assets are growing and guaranteed
by the federal agency, Lockhart said.
   The agency released the list because ``employees should be aware
of how their pension plans are funded,'' said an agency spokeswoman.
   The list of 50 companines came from a survey of information
filed by about 7,000 corporations with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The survey did not include a review of pension plans
for banks, utlities, life insurance, property and casualty firms or
companies not required to file with the SEC.
   Potential abuse within the nation's $1.7 trillion pension system
is a growing concern on Capitol Hill, where both House and Senate
panels are looking into the matter.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has asked Congress to approve
funding for an additional 100 agents to police the pensions system.
   Here are the 50 companies listed Monday and the size of their
potential shortfall if the plans were to close and the PBGC had to
guarantee benefits:
   Allegheny International Inc., $52 million; Allegheny Ludlum
Corp., $79 million; American Airlines, $258 million; American
Financial Corp., $47 million; Anchor Glass Container Corp., $66
million; Armco Inc., $323 million; ASI Holding Corp., $194 million;
