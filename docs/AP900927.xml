<HEAD>Jurors In Salcido Trial Listen To His Taped Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramon Salcido said in a statement
played for jurors Thursday that anger and drugs sparked the rage
that led him to kill seven people.
   ``I don't feel like I wanted to kill nobody ... I wanna have
some beers, you know, and forget everything else. But wife's made
me feel that (way) when she start, when she left me at home with my
kids and take off,'' Ramon Salcido said in the two-hour tape that
jurors followed with the help of a transcript.
   Salcido, 29, is being tried in San Mateo Superior Court for the
murder of his wife, Angela, two of his daughters, his mother-in-law
and her two daughters and a co-worker at the Grand Cru winery.
   He also faces three counts of attempted murder for attacks on a
third daughter, another co-worker and the co-worker's wife.
   Salcido was arrested in his native Mexico four days after the
April 14, 1989, slayings in Sonoma County. The trial was moved here
because of extensive pre-trial publicity.
   In the taped statement Salcido made while being returned to
California, he said he was angry with his wife because she had
married him while pregnant with another man's child. He said he was
angry at his mother-in-law for not telling him about the child's
parentage and angry at his supervisor because he thought the man
tried to have him fired.
   Defense attorney Marteen Miller concedes his client committed
the crimes, but claims Salcido was not capable of planning the
murders and therefore should not be convicted of first-degree
murder or face the death penalty.
   Salcido had been an alcoholic since age 18 and had consumed
three grams of cocaine and three bottles of champagne in the hours
before the slayings, Miller claims.
   Prosecutor Peter Bumerts said the tape supports his contention
the slayings were premeditated.
   ``Anybody that says `I decided to go kill my children because I
was mad at my wife,' and then goes to a place where he will not be
seen is not mentally impaired,'' Bumerts said.
   Near the end of the statement, when asked if he wants to add
anything more, Salcido said the drug dealers who supplied him are
partly responsible, claiming he would not have committed the
attacks sober.
   Several times, Salcido expressed remorse, said he was scared and
that he felt as though he were someone else.
   ``I'm ready to receive anything and everything you guys to do,''
he said. ``I don't feel like, I wanted to try not being guilty when
I know, I know that I'm guilty.''

   Cornelius P. Turner, developer of the
General Educational Development tests that permit non-graduates to
win certificates equivalent to a high school diploma, is dead at
83.
   Turner died of blood poisoning at Alexandria Hospital on
Wednesday. He lived in Alexandria.
   As a Navy lieutenant from 1943 to 1945, Turner directed a
program that developed high-school diploma equivalency tests for
use by members of the armed services during World War II.
   After the war, he held a number of positions that helped expand
use of the tests until all U.S. states and Canadian provinces
adopted them. About 700,000 people a year take the tests.
   He taught mathematics and history at Leicester, Mass. and served
as superintendent of schools there before World War II.
   Turner is survived by a son and two grandchildren. His wife of
53 years, Mary, died in 1987.

<HEAD>President Fujimori To Ease Restrictions on Foreign Investment in
Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alberto Fujimori, whose country is
starved for foreign capital, says he will ease restrictions on
foreign investment in Peru's petroleum, fishing, mining and tourism
industries.
   Fujimori said Wednesday that he would promote ``legislation to
speed up negotiations with foreign investors and eliminate laws
that limit the potential profitability of these investments.''
   Foreign corporations will soon be able to repatriate profits
from their Peruvian operations, Fujimori told a luncheon given by
the American Chamber of Commerce in Lima.
   Upon taking office on July 28, Fujimori began a series of
measures to curb hyperinflation and open Peru's economy to world
markets.
   The measures have included drastic rises in the costs of
government services and the end of most price controls and
subsidies.
   Fujimori also slashed import tariffs, forcing Peru's
traditionally highly protected industries to compete with foreign
products.
   The measures sent prices soaring 397 percent in August, but
prices in September are expected to rise less than 5 percent.
   The austerity plan has left Peru's economy virtually paralyzed.
   Many factories are closed and thousands of small businesses are
expected to go bankrupt.
   At Wednesday's lunch, Fujimori assured businessmen they were
safe from ``the risk of of expropriation, illegal change of
ownership or conversion into national currency'' of foreign profits
in Peru.
   Fujimori's predecessor, Alan Garcia, threatened to nationalize
various foreign concerns in Peru. These included the mines of
Southern Peru Copper Corporation, the largest U.S. company
operating in Peru.
   Fujimori said the results of his austerity measures were
``encouraging.''
   He said Peru needed ``fiscal and monetary discipline to create a
climate of confidence'' for foreign investment.
   ``President George Bush has said prosperity in Latin America
depends on trade, not aid,'' Fujimori said. ``We agree on that
one.''
   Fujimori's Prime Minister, Juan Hurtado Miller, is in Washington
this week for talks with the International Monetary Fund.
   Peru cut relations with the IMF in 1987, after unilaterally
limiting payments on its $20 billion foreign debt the year before.
   Hurtado hopes to come home with fresh loans if the IMF approves
of Peru's austerity measures. IMF officials have indicated they
will.

   George Clinton of the funk group Parliament
Funkadelic drove across the state line to get married rather than
wait three days for a license in Michigan.
   The 49-year-old funk king and Stephanie Lynn Goshorn, 34, both
from Brooklyn, Mich., walked into the Lucas County Courthouse with
little fanfare Tuesday but didn't leave unnoticed.
   Connie Krall, the deputy clerk who wrote the license, said her
co-workers recognized Clinton.
   ``I'd never heard of him,'' Ms. Krall said. ``But when I saw his
hair, I thought he was going to be outrageous, like Little Richard,
but he wasn't. He was very courteous and he never played up his
celebrity status.''
   Michigan has a three-day waiting period for a marriage license.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Lucille Ball's daughter, Lucie Arnaz, plans to
produce a musical about her father, Cuban bandleader and TV star
Desi Arnaz.
   ``My father wrote a book years ago about coming to this country
and his band and all that and was always talking about turning it
into a musical, and finally he said, `What the hell. I'll never
make it. You try,''' she said in the Sept. 30 issue of Parade
magazine. Her father died in 1986.
   Her husband, actor and writer Laurence Luckinbill, wrote a
script for ``Desi: The Musical'' and the couple hope to produce it
within the next couple of months.
   Arnaz, 39, is back on television in ``Sons and Daughters,'' in
which she plays a single mother raising an adopted daughter.
   Her last TV effort, ``The Lucie Arnaz Show,'' flopped five years
ago. From 1968 to 1974, she played the daughter of her real-life
mother in ``Here's Lucy.''

   LONDON (AP) - British hat designer David Shilling has been
recruited by the United Nations to assist Ecuador in strengthening
its hat-making industry.
   The U.N. International Trade Center said Wednesday that Shilling
will visit Ecuador in October to advise artisans on the fashion
requirements of Western markets.
   Shilling's creations are usually standouts in the hat parade at
the Ascot races attended by Queen Elizabeth II.
   His designs are on display at New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art, the Azabu in Tokyo and the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Three years after Paramount Pictures bought the
rights to his award-winning play ``Fences,'' August Wilson says
production has been stalled by his insistence on a black director.
   The playwright said he is seeking a director ``who would
approach my work with the same amount of passion and measure of
respect with which I approach it and who shares the same cultural
sensibilities of the characters.''
   ``The last time I looked, all those directors were black,'' he
wrote in the October issue of Spin magazine.
   Wilson, who won a Tony and a Pulitzer for the drama in 1987,
said he rejected a respected white director ``not on the basis of
race but on the basis of culture.''
   Wilson said this week that Paramount agreed in March to hire a
black director and recently began suggesting names.
   ``I consider their agreement a small victory,'' he said in a
statement. ``I will consider their actually hiring a black director
a greater victory.''

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - A film crew has begun shooting
scenes from ``Billy Bathgate,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as
Depression-era gangster Dutch Schultz, at Saratoga's famed
racecourse.
   A crew of more than 100, plus 500 locally recruited extras,
filmed racing and crowd scenes Wednesday at the thoroughbred track.
   The Disney film, based on the 1989 best-selling novel by E.L.
Doctorow, is about a New York City boy who joins Schultz's gang in
1935.
   Loren Dean plays Billy Bathgate, and Nicole Kidman, girlfriend
of Tom Cruise, plays Drew Preston, Schultz' moll. The film is due
out next year.
   About 1,000 extras will be used during the film's three-week
stay in Saratoga Springs. Most of the filming will take place in
New York City and North Carolina.
   Linda Toohey, executive vice president of the Saratoga County
Chamber of Commerce, said she drove around Saratoga County last
spring with a member of the film production staff to take snapshots
of potential locations.
   A location she would not disclose was the one selected for a
scene in which Billy and Drew go skinny-dipping. For that, the
filmmakers needed water deep enough for a stuntwoman to make a dive
off a 20-foot cliff, she said.

<HEAD>Peace Activists Renew Dialogue After Gulf Crisis Rift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli peace activists have renewed dialogue
with Palestinian leaders following disagreements over the PLO's
position in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   After a two-hour meeting, the leftist ``Peace Now'' movement and
Palestinians headed by activist Faisal Husseini agreed late
Wednesday to resume talks on the occupied territories and other
issues.
   ``We want to keep up our meetings even if is against the emotion
in the street right now,'' Husseini told an assembly of 100
Israelis.
   ``The going will be tough,'' Yitzhak Galnoor, a Peace Now
activist. ``But once all the dust settles we see that three years
of an uprising cannot be ignored, we still have the same problem to
solve.''
   During the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip at least 996
Palestinians have been killed and 52 Israelis and foreigners have
died.
   Quarrels among the peace groups began when the Palestine
Liberation Organization sided with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Husseini said the PLO objects to war and to Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait. But he also said Palestinians were angrier with the United
States than they were supportive of Iraq.
   ``American forces are there for their own interests, the price
of oil. But they are completely neglecting our case,'' he said.
   Husseini was unable to persuade Israelis at the meeting to issue
a joint statement urging the United States to resolve the Persian
Gulf crisis peacefully and then turn to the Palestinian issue.
   Another Palestinian activist, Ghassan Khatib, asserted ``there
were some mistakes made by Palestinians and the PLO (about the gulf
crisis) and we should acknowledge that.''
   ``We feared from the start we were going to be losers,'' Khatib
added, noting the gulf problems have overshadowed the Palestinian
issues.
   Both sides agreed to continue their meetings. Leaders of Peace
Now resolved to press on trying to persuade Israelis that the
government should end its diplomatic boycott of the PLO.
   ``We're going to have to get back to this issue. There is no
other solution but to talk to the Palestinians, the PLO,'' said
Galia Golan, a professor of political science at Jerusalem's Hebrew
University.

<HEAD>Automatic Budget Cuts: Fewer Maps for Troops, Grounded Space
Shuttles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be fewer maps for troops in the
Middle East. A million children won't be vaccinated against polio,
measles and diphtheria. There may not be enough government lawyers
to argue before the Supreme Court. Airline flights will be reduced
and most space shuttles won't fly at all.
   All this, and more, is predicted if there is no budget agreement
and the president orders automatic spending cuts Monday, the first
day of the government's 1991 fiscal year.
   For 2.4 million federal employees with mortgage payments and
mouths to feed, the impact could range from a few days off without
pay to the devastation that faces Jeannette Gordon. She could be
laid off 255 days out of a work year of 260.
   Most agencies of the government expect to be forced to trim
expenses by 32.4 percent. They'll do it by cutting services to the
taxpayer, suspending programs, furloughing employees, putting off
that needed paint job or turning out the lights at night.
   The Gramm-Rudman law doesn't much care. It requires whatever it
takes to slim down federal spending by $100 billion or so in fiscal
1991. Most federal employees can be laid off for 22 days with a
simple notice; after that the rules get more complicated.
   The prospect facing Mrs. Gordon, who works for perhaps the
smallest agency in government, is unique.
   ``We don't have contracts we can cut and we don't have employees
to lay off,'' says Mrs. Gordon, one of two people who run the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission. ``My budget for 1991 is
$211,000; our 32.4 percent is $68,364,'' she says. What remains
goes into office expenses and the salary of Commissioner Warner
Depuy, who won't be furloughed because he is a presidential
appointee.
   ``That,'' she says with a sigh, ``doesn't leave anything to hire
me.''
   Ironically, Mrs. Gordon used to work at the Office of Management
and Budget, which tells the president what kind of a cut to order.
   `I worked at OMB for 17 years,'' she says. ``I was always on the
other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. I never knewit worked like
that.''
   The way it works is this. To save money:
   -There would be fewer maps produced by the Defense Mapping
Agency, which has worked overtime to make 20 million maps for
Operation Desert Shield since the Middle East crisis began. The
agency's 8,000 employees are on notice they might be furloughed.
   -Meat counters would be emptier as 7,344 federal meat and
poultry inspectors shave weeks off their annual duties. A
sequester, which is what the cutback in funds is called, ``would
result in the absence of inspection services and the shutting down
of meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants for about 140
days,'' the House Appropriations Committee predicts.
   -NASA would have to cancel the space station and drop or
postpone all 21 shuttle flights scheduled in 1991 and 1992,
according to the committee. But the agency says it has enough money
left over to launch the first shuttle in the new fiscal year, on
Oct. 6.
   -Commercial airplanes would not be able to fly at night because
the National Weather Service will close 250 stations from 6 p.m. to
6 a.m. Pilots need up-to-date weather information. The Federal
Aviation Administration would start cutbacks with 20 percent fewer
flights the first three days because controllers will be furloughed
two days each in every two-week pay period.
   Many important government activities are immune to cutbacks. The
Postal Service, which gets its money from the business it conducts,
is not affected. Social Security benefits, federal retirement and
disability payments, veterans' compensation and pensions, state
unemployment and many low-income entitlement programs are
untouched.
   The affairs of state won't suffer. The State Department plans to
exempt people whose jobs deal with crisis spots, but cut back on
travel and overtime. The White House will furlough people one day a
week on different days. A joke making the rounds is that
presidential dog Millie will have to give back one of her pups.
   The Justice Department said furloughs during the first two weeks
of the new fiscal year would range from one day per Drug
Enforcement Administration employee to nine days at the Foreign
Claims Settlement Commission. Layoffs will hobble prosecutions of
savings and loan fraud and make it difficult to operate the
nation's overcrowded federal prisons, officials say.
   The furloughs ``hit us at the worst possible time,'' said Deputy
Solicitor General John Roberts, whose lawyers are scheduled to
argue 10 of the 20 cases scheduled to be heard before the Supreme
Court in the first two weeks of October.
   ``The arguments will be 20 percent shorter,'' Roberts quipped.
   Checks written to farmers under various commodity programs,
including price support loans and direct payments, will be reduced
by the percentage of the sequester.
   About $84 million in federal grants to states for foster care,
adoption and child protective services would be eliminated,
straining state child welfare systems. Biomedical research would be
cut by $3.5 billion and 30,000 drug abusers would not get
treatment.
   The government has pulled its Perils of Pauline act nearly every
year in recent times, threatening to run out of money, but Congress
always comes to the rescue. Sequestration has been required only
twice before: in the current fiscal year, which ends Sunday, and in
1986.
   The General Accounting Office checked five departments to see
how they were affected by the 1990 cutback and found few dire
effects.
   Although many agencies will hold staff meetings on Friday to
finalize their plans, the likelihood is that no one will know the
extent of the required cuts, if any, until Sunday.
   ``If there is no action before Friday,'' said Laura Kopelson of
GAO, ``our instructions are to be watching the news on Monday
morning.''

   As the change of season cools the
sun-scorched Saudi desert and fills the sky with clouds, U.S.
military planners have a new weather worry - sandstorms.
   A ``sarrayat,'' Arabic for `the night comer', could occur at
critical moments for ground forces, whose tactics are heavily
geared toward fighting under cover of darkness.
   The night sandstorms are brief but violent and are sometimes
accompanied by lightning and thunder.
   Even in daylight, strategists must reckon with seasonal storms
called ``shamal,'' the Arabic word for north, which pick up sand
and turn the sky yellow for hours or an entire day.
   A U.S. Navy captain said recently that his ship had turned from
the official gray to a subtle shade of brown after a few weeks in
the Persian Gulf.
   American troops have learned to protect their vehicles and
aircraft from the incessant dust and sand - using such
modifications as pantyhose for filters. But they have not yet
experienced the fury of the sustained desert winds that sometimes
reduce visibility to near zero and cause even the hardiest Bedouins
and their camels to hunker down.
   ``We're not overly concerned, just aware that there's a
possibility of dust storms,'' said 1st Lt. Todd Fasking, an Air
Force meteorologist.
   ``The percent of time that they occur is really very small, but
if a storm comes at absolutely the worst time, the percentage
doesn't matter.''
   Saudi experts say the desert storms this time of year are less
severe than those of the ``Khamseen,'' or 50 days, from late May
through early July, when the Indian Ocean monsoons generate a
low-pressure system over the desert.
   American strategists have not forgotten the 1980 Iranian hostage
rescue attempt that ended in disaster when the helicopters suddenly
became caught in a sandstorm that one pilot later described as
``like flying in a bowl of milk.''
   And history suggests that the northern Saudi region, where more
than 150,000 U.S. troops are deployed, may be overdue for bad
weather.
   Jaber Jum Ah, a consultant on desert weather for Aramco, the
Saudi-owned oil company, said severe storm seasons come every six
or seven years. he last one was in 1983, he said.
   They usually occur between Oct. 10 and Nov. 10, he said.
   The worst season in modern times was 1925, the year of the
``sinkings'' - so-called because hundreds of small craft were
swamped and lost in a gulf storm that lasted about half an hour.
   ``The gulf is not so deep, and the seas can run as much as 15
feet - not serious for big ships but very dangerous for small
ones,'' Jum Ah said.
   While the storms may arise suddenly, meteorologists say
threatening weather patterns can be predicted and monitored.
   Fasking said winter frontal systems develop in Saudi Arabia much
as they do in United States, generally moving from west to east,
and can be observed by satellite.
   ``We can see a front coming and track it,'' Fasking said. ``With
the satellite we can see suspended sand as it kicks up out of
northern Saudi Arabia into central Saudi.''
   He said advisories are issued when winds reach velocities that
could jeopardize visibility for air operations.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Filipinos are fleeing
the Persian Gulf area, but thousands more are still flocking to the
Middle East, searching for jobs to escape poverty and hopelessness
in this troubled island nation.
   Over the last year, an average of 15,000 Filipinos a month left
for jobs in the gulf, and that figure still holds true despite the
crisis precipitated by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, according
to the state-run Philippine Overseas Employment Agency.
   Chartered jets which recently flew hundreds of exhausted and
penniless refugees home from camps in Jordan have been returning to
the Middle East packed with new job-seekers.
   ``If you remain in our country, you will never prosper,'' said
Letty Solis, whose mechanic husband Leopoldo is still looking for
work after returning from Kuwait last month.
   Statistics show why Filipinos leave families behind to work in
the gulf.
   The unemployment rate here stands at more than 8 percent and is
expected to increase as thousands of workers return from Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Before the crisis, an estimated 90,000 Filipinos were working in
Kuwait and Iraq. About 16,500 have returned to the Philippines.
   ``The mimimum pay you get here is not enough to buy the basics
for yourself, much less your family,'' said Miguel Ramos, 35, an
unemployed electrician who has just been hired by a firm in Saudi
Arabia.
   A job here for Ramos would pay about $88 a month. He expects to
make more than four times that in the gulf.
   Ramos acknowledged, ``It's a gamble. I know it's risky but I'd
rather take it. Besides, things are so unstable in our country
anyway that it doesn't make any difference where you are. If you
are used to hardships then it doesn't matter if there's war.''
   President Corazon Aquino's government has promised to help
workers who fled Kuwait and Iraq find other jobs abroad. But of the
16,500 workers who have come home since the invasion, fewer than
100 have found new jobs overseas through government efforts.
   For most, conditions are desperate. Many of those who left
Kuwait lost most of their savings when banks wre closed and the
Kuwaiti dinar declared invalid.
   Gulf labor laws make it nearly impossible for refugees from
Kuwait to land jobs in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or
other gulf countries without first returning to the Philippines.
   Every day, the semiprivate Overseas Workers' Welfare
Adminstration headquarters teems with returnees inquiring about
jobs abroad and applying for $120 in emergency displacement loans
which returning workers are authorized to obtain.
   That would feed an average-sized Filipino family of five for two
weeks. Many must borrow money or move in with friends and relatives
after years of relative comfort and prosperity abroad.
   ``I will still go back there if things normalize,'' said Mars
Ariola, who worked in Kuwait as a truck driver for five years. ``If
I cannot get into the Middle East, then I will try Europe or any
other country.''
   Except for banning travel to Kuwait, Iraq and parts of Saudi
Arabia, the government has done nothing to prevent thousands of its
citizens from working in the Persian Gulf despite fears that the
region may explode into full-scale war.
   Filipinos working in the Middle East send home about $1.3
billion a year, a major source of foreign exchange. Remittances
from Kuwait and Iraq accounted for about 5 percent of the foreign
exchange, official figures show.
   ``We have to consider the need for them to earn and also for the
country to get revenues from the foreign exchange earnings of our
workers,'' presidential spokesman Adolf Azcuna said. ``We just hope
that the workers will be deployed to areas far from trouble.''

   The Persian Gulf crisis is forcing
Saudi Arabia, which traditionally has relied on quiet diplomacy, to
take aggressive steps - even against Arab states once considered
allies.
   Jordan and Yemen have already experienced the newfound Saudi
punitive power. Indications are that the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or at least its leader Yasser Arafat, will be next.

broken with Iraq over its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, could soon see
its relations with Riyadh sour.
   ``There will be a settlement of accounts when this is over,'' a
Saudi diplomatic official said Wednesday. ``We have to stand up for
principle. It is no more Mr. Nice Guy. . . . There is no longer the
fear of offending Arabs.''
   As Saudi Arabia deliberately strains relations with some
traditional Arab allies, it is moving quickly to improve its
position on the world stage, re-establishing ties with Moscow and
Beijing.
   Senior Saudi officials believe the crisis has dashed any hopes
for Arab unity and created an atmosphere in which Arab states will
seek to bolster their standing outside the region.
   ``The bubble of pan-Arabism is burst,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now maybe all of us can be
more honest.''
   The international rush to help defend Saudi Arabia from Iraq has
persuaded Saudi officials they can take on fellow Arab states over
disputes they might have glossed over in the past.
   ``The whole world has underwritten the security of the gulf
region,'' a Saudi prince said Monday.
   In the past, Saudi Arabia shied away from a forceful public role
in Arab policy debates, choosing quiet diplomacy and use of its
huge foreign aid budget to sway friends.
   Now, angered by King Hussein's refusal to break with Baghdad and
by the Jordanian monarch's criticism of the Saudis for opening
their country to foreign troops, the Saudi government has come out
swinging.
   Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United
States, wrote an open letter to Hussein attacking the king. He
ended, ``I no longer can feel that you are the same man I knew.''
   Choosing Bandar to deliver the message was a sign of the Saudis'
new interest in aggressive diplomacy.
   ``The playing field was American public opinion,'' the Saudi
official said. ``King Hussein was trying to go over our head and
over the head of George Bush. So we chose our spokesman who was
most eloquent in dealing with American matters. ''
   Bandar's public denouncement came after a series of jolts in
Saudi-Jordanian relations.
   Saudi Arabia first cut off Jordan's oil supplies, saying Amman's
bills were overdue, then expelled most Jordanian diplomats for
alleged espionage.
   ``None of this convinced . . . (Hussein) to change course and we
lost patience,'' another Saudi official said. He said Jordan has
received little, if any Saudi aid since the invasion. ``Right now
our line is, `The check is in the mail.' Soon he'll find out we
forgot to put a stamp on it.''
   With Yemen, which initially opposed slapping santions on Iraq,
Saudi Arabia ended its open border policy and then expelled most
Yemeni diplomats for alleged espionage.
   Yemen sided with the Saudis when the U.N. Security Council voted
Tuesday to impose an air embargo against Iraq. The Saudi diplomatic
official said Riyadh viewed those votes as encouraging but was not
yet ready to forgive Yemen.
   ``Our actions might have had something to do with the vote but
there was a lot of American pressure, too,'' one of the officials
said.
   The Saudis are far more reluctant to criticize Arafat, but say
privately that he is unwelcome in their country and could face
sharp cutbacks in aid.
   One idea under consideration is to give direct aid to
Palestinian housing and other social services projects, but little
or nothing to the PLO chief directly.
   The Saudi officials said they have been satisfied with their
handling of the gulf crisis to date but it was too soon to grade
diplomatic efforts.
   ``We have to be aggressive now - it is a matter of life and
death,'' the diplomatic official said. ``But we can't say what will
happen in the future. We are all learning a lesson right now.''

<HEAD>Census Figures Show Rich-Poor Gap Widening, Lawmaker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Census Bureau figures show that the gap
between the rich and the poor is widening, says the chairman of the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``Those at the top of the scale are receiving an ever-larger
share of the pie,'' Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said Wednesday after
the bureau released its annual report on income and poverty.
   ``Meanwhile, families in the middle and at the bottom are barely
keeping ahead of inflation,'' Hamilton said. ``The gap between the
rich and the poor is widening when it should be shrinking.''
   Robert Greenstein, executive director of a liberal research
group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the 12.8
percent poverty rate reported by the bureau is a bad sign.
   ``With the economy running out of steam and a new recession
threatening, the poverty rate is likely to start rising again,''
Greenstein said. ``That means an already high poverty rate is
likely to climb higher and if the recession is a deep one it could
reach poverty levels not seen for a quarter of a century.''
   Both liberals and conservatives continued to clamor for a change
in the way the Census Bureau figures out who is poor.
   For the third year in a row, the bureau said the decline in the
poverty rate between 1988 and 1989 was so small that it was not
statistically significant. The 1988 rate was 13 percent.
   The bureau said 31.5 million Americans were below the poverty
level last year. For a family of four, that level is an annual
income of $12,675. In 1988, 31.7 million were below it.
   ``It is time to update our official poverty measure to provide a
more accurate reflection of today's economic needs,'' Hamilton
said.
   A Joint Economic Committee study last year suggested that the
poverty thresholds might increase as much as 50 percent if they
took into account such things as the increasing share of income
that is now paid for housing.
   On the other hand, Kate O'Beirne, deputy director for domestic
policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said,
``Owing to the method they use, the Census Bureau dramatically
overstates the number of people in poverty.''
   The problem, she said, is that the bureau counts only money as
income and does not include such things as food stamps and Medicaid
and Medicare benefits.
   In an appendix to its report, the Census Bureau said that with
the addition of these and other non-cash items, the poverty rate
would be as low as 10.4 percent.
   Both Daniel Weinberg, chief of the Housing and Household
Economic Statistics division of the bureau, and Greenstein said
that adopting such an alternative method would not affect the trend
of poverty rates.
   The bureau reported that median household income in 1989 was
$28,910, up 1.3 percent from 1988 after adjusting for rising living
costs. Household income had been unchanged in the previous two
years.
   The bureau said the wealthiest one-fifth of households received
46.8 percent of the income. While this was no higher than in 1988,
it was significantly higher than the percentages of 44.2 percent in
1979 and 43 percent in 1969.
   Those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder received
somewhat lower shares of the aggregate income.
   ``There seems little doubt that the income distribution has
become somewhat less equal over the past 20 years,'' the bureau
said. It said the reasons for this are not clear.

<HEAD>Air Force C-17's Cost Hits Estimated $400 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is estimating that the cost of
its C-17 transport has risen to $400 million per plane and fears
the aircraft's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, may go bankrupt by
year's end, a House committee chairman says.
   In a letter released Wednesday, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
cited the company's cost overruns and excessive work hours as
evidence of a ``management collapse'' in the program to build 120
of the wide-body planes.
   Dingell based his assessment on internal Pentagon documents,
reports from McDonnell Douglas and an inquiry conducted by the
staff of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight
and investigations. Dingell is chairman of both the full committee
and the subcommittee.
   An unidentified Air Force official who had been working with the
company told the panel's staff that ``in his opinion, McDonnell
Douglas management was committing corporate suicide,'' Dingell
said.
   The official said the options left to the Air Force were to
either suspend or significantly cut progress payments on the C-17
program, but a financial analysis of the company concluded that if
the payments were cut, McDonnell Douglas might go bankrupt.
   ``Regardless of the progress payments issue, the Air Force
believes that McDonnell Douglas may go bankrupt by the end of the
year,'' Dingell said in the letter.
   He also cited internal Pentagon reports that estimated the
C-17's cost at more than $400 million per plane. Air Force
officials testified to Congress last June that the plane, which
will replace the current C-141 aircraft, will cost an estimated
$249 million.
   Richard Hill, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman in Long Beach,
Calif., said the company has estimated that when the C-17 program
is completed the cost will be below the ceiling levels in the
government contract.
   Hill acknowledged past reports of schedule problems and delays
but said that since November 1989, the company ``has met every
milestone set. In the past few months, the landing gear was placed
on the airplane. It's going to fly in June. The progress is
there.''
   Hill declined to comment on the bankruptcy issue.
   McDonnell Douglas, in an internal report dated April 1990,
estimated a cost overrun of $836 million on the C-17 contract. In
the last month, however, the contractor spent $118 million to
complete work that was estimated at $47 million.
   Overhead expenses of $51 million in the internal report far
exceeded the cost of $15 million, while administrative expenses of
$9 million were about three times the projected cost of $3 million.
   Dingell, in his letter to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, bristled at the number of hours
it took to produce work that McDonnell Douglas' own industrial
engineers said should take only one.
   For example, he said, 25.8 assembly hours were spent on the
aircraft when one was determined to be sufficient.
   ``We found an appalling picture in factory labor performance,''
Dingell said.
   Problems with the program were raised in June when the Air Force
decided to take away the approval it had previously granted to
McDonnell Douglas on its purchasing system for the C-17.
   The decision meant the company must get Air Force approval for
purchases in excess of $100,000. The Air Force told Congress that
the action would not delay the program.
   Nevertheless, concerns about the program prompted the Senate, in
adopting a $289 billion defense authorization bill last month, to
defer buying two planes in fiscal 1991 because of development and
testing delays.
   The House, in a $283 billion defense bill approved last week,
cut President Bush's request for about $700 million for the two
planes to about $500 million.
   But the House also restricted spending any money in the fiscal
year beginning next Monday until Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
certifies the successful completion of the first flight of the
production aircraft.

   Intense political differences over abortion
derailed a bill in the Senate that would extend a 20-year-old law
providing federal aid to clinics that offer family planning
services to the poor.
   The Senate adopted provisions sought by both opponents of
abortion and advocates of abortion rights in two days of debate,
but then pushed the bill aside Wednesday when a vote to limit
debate failed.
   ``I don't think a bill (on family planning services) is going to
clear Congress after this,'' said Doug Johnson, legislative
director of the anti-abortion National Right To Life Committee.
   The bill would renew the family planning programs funded under
Title X of the Public Health Service Act. Its authorization
actually expired five years ago, and the services have been
continued each year through passage of catchall spending bills, but
advocates sought reauthorization with increases in federal support.
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 62-36, an amendment that would
nullify Bush administration regulations prohibiting family planning
clinics that receive federal money from offering any information or
counseling involving abortion. Legal challenges to those
regulations are before the Supreme Court.
   On Wednesday, the Senate accepted an amendment requiring the
notification of the parents of any girl under age 18 who seeks an
abortion from an organization receiving federal family-planning
money.
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., an
abortion opponent, was passed on a unanimous voice vote. But the
key vote came earlier when the Senate rejected, 54-43, a motion to
table, or kill, the amendment.
   The family planning organizations are prohibited from using
federal money for abortions, but Armstrong said more than 30
perform abortions at the same clinic that provides federally
supported family planning services.
   ``In almost every jurisdiction you have to have the permission
of your parent ... to give blood,'' he said. ``But there is a
surgical procedure for which that is not required, and it is
abortion.''
   When backers sought a vote to set a time to end debate - a move
needed to bring the overall bill to a direct vote - they failed by
10 votes to get the required 60 votes.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill's sponsor, said the
action means the Senate turns ``our back on millions of
teen-agers.''
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, suggested Democrats had only
pushed the bill to force President Bush's veto and said the
services would again be funded regardless of the bill's outcome.
   ``Nobody is going to be denied those funds,'' Hatch said.
   In the House, meanwhile, a similar measure was approved by the
Energy and Commerce Committee without any of the controversial
Senate provisions on abortion.

   Bernard Gifford is a product of a government
push 30 years ago to create more nuclear scientists, so he is
convinced that Congress can propel his idea to put technology
specialists in each school district.
   Gifford, vice president of education marketing for Apple
Computer Inc., addressed more than 70 members of Congress on
Wednesday.
   ``I believe the time has come for universities and school
districts to create a new job, that of chief technology officer, on
the same par as an academic dean or superintendent of
instruction,'' he said.
   Gifford said such a the technology officer would be ``far more
than just a person in charge of computers,'' but also one who
understands the use of technology and have visions of ``where we're
headed.''
   ``My argument is we will not understand how to use the
technology or how to implement it unless we create people at a high
enough level ... whose obligation it is to add intelligence to the
technology,'' he said.
   Gifford said there are only about a few million computers in use
in the nation's schools for the 44 million students in public and
private primary and secondary schools. Rapid advancement of
technology makes it difficult for schools to keep their equipment
up to date and many of the teachers are not adequately trained to
use the sophisticated technology.
   Asked about the cost of his idea, Gifford acknowledged the tight
budget problems but stressed said Congress ``is in a unique
position to champion the development.''
   ``The federal government in the past has stimulated the creation
of a generation of specialists in Eastern European languages,
molecular biology and nuclear science when there was a great need
for those professions,'' he said.
   ``Just as the government encouraged a generation to pursue those
scholarly pursuits, I hope similar incentives will be available for
those educators who want to guide schools and colleges into the
Information Age,'' he said.
   When the government pushed in the 1960s for more nuclear
scientists, Gifford said he received a fellowship that paid his way
through graduate school and gave him a $4,000 yearly stipend.
   ``All I had to do was major in biophysics,'' said Gifford, a
Brooklyn native who has worked as a teacher, a deputy commissioner
of education for New York City public schools and dean of the
School of Education at the University of California at Berkeley.

<HEAD>NAACP Campaigning to Keep Soap Opera `Generations' on the Air</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are breaking down the ``iron curtain''
that once barred them from important jobs in the television and
movie industries, but more progress is needed, the NAACP said in
joining a campaign to keep the multiracial daytime drama,
``Generations,'' on the air.
   The 17-month-old soap opera, which employs many blacks in front
of and behind the cameras, is being dropped by some stations
nationwide and needs public support, NAACP officials said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   ``Generations'' co-star Jonelle Allen, who received a
congressional citation for her work from Rep. Mervyn Dymally,
D-Calif., urged viewers to contact their local NBC-affiliated
stations and ``Let it be known that you love `Generations.'''
   Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was too ill to
attend the news conference but sent a message that was read by an
aide, Bill Pollard.
   ``While it is agreed that African Americans have made some
strides in the breaking through what was previously an iron curtain
that prevented them from exercising any real power in these
industries, it is obvious a great deal still remains to be done,''
Hooks said. ``We are, therefore, in total support of any and all
efforts that will accomplish these goals.''
   ``Generations'' deals with two families - one black, the other
white - with multigenerational ties. NBC describes it as the first
daytime drama to focus equally on two families of different races.
   Pollard said the American public needs to see blacks ``portrayed
as we are every day and not as a subclass or a second class.''
   He said the NAACP would urge its 1,700 chapters to lobby NBC
affiliates to try to prevent ``Generations'' from being dropped
from any more daytime lineups.
   Sally Sussman, the show's creator-executive producer, said
``Generations'' was broadcast on 99 percent of NBC's 200-plus
affiliated stations after it debuted in March 1989, but now it is
seen on 92 percent of the stations.
   She said that even though the network ``totally supports'' the
program, it had been dropped recently by NBC affiliates in Boston,
Phoenix, Tulsa, Okla.; and Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla.
   If more defections occur, Sussman said, ``At some point it will
not be economically feasible for NBC to carry the show.''
   NBC officials did not immediately comment Wednesday, but NBC
Entertainment Group Chairman Brandon Tartikoff was quoted recently
as saying he would give the show six more months before
re-evaluating its future.

<HEAD>CIA Document Says South Africa May Have Built Nukes in '70s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa has been developing nuclear
weapons for years and may have begun producing them in 1979 or
earlier, says a newly disclosed CIA document.
   The memorandum, obtained by the environmentalist Natural
Resources Defense Council under the Freedom of Information Act, was
written in December 1979 at the request of the National Security
Council. It sought to determine who was responsible for a nuclear
explosion detected on Sept. 22, 1979, by a U.S. Vela satellite off
the African coast.
   The document did not appear to present a conclusive answer,
unless it was hidden in the portions that were blacked out for
reasons of national security. While all the intelligence agencies
appeared to agree South Africa could have done it, they differed on
whether it did.
   Late in 1977, the CIA found, the South African government
suspended preparations to test a nuclear weapon because of strong
pressure from the United States.
   But the CIA said it didn't believe South African denials about
the 1979 explosion.
   The commander of the South African Navy made allegations,
``which we believe to be false, that a Soviet nuclear submarine has
been seen in the vicinity ... implicitly denying that the South
African Navy was involved in a nuclear test conducted at sea,'' the
memo said.
   The Defense Intelligence Agency, an arm of the Defense
Department, ``believes that South Africa probably would have had
enough confidence in Israeli security to consider conducting a
joint test.''
   South Africa and Israel, both ostracized on the international
stage in the 1970s, have cooperated on many defense projects. Under
strong international pressure, Israel promised last year to stop.
   ``Israelis have not only participated in certain South African
nuclear research activities over the last few years, but they have
also offered and transferred various sorts of advanced non-nuclear
weapons technology to South Africa,'' the CIA said in the 1979
report.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said Wednesday it was
making the document public to prevent South Africa from hiding
large amounts of enriched uranium from international inspection.
   South Africa has announced it wants to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would place its nuclear facilities
under international inspection to ensure they were only used for
non-military purposes.
   ``If they're going to sign this treaty, let's not forget they
had this program way back when. Let's get accountability for what
they produced then,'' said Richard Fieldhouse, a nuclear
proliferation specialist at NRDC.
   South Africa has cloaked its nuclear program in secrecy and
ambiguity over the years, preferring to keep its adversaries
guessing.
   The 1979 memo said that ``until recently, South Africa lacked
the relevant technology and fissile material'' but estimated it
``has by this time acquired sufficient fissile material for the
fabrication of several nuclear devices.''
   One fissile material is uranium that is enriched to such a
concentrated level that it can be used to make weapons. South
Africa is the world's third largest producer of uranium.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk visited the White House
ths week, and the United States pressed again for his country to
sign the non-proliferation treaty, officials said.
   Last week, the Customs Service accused an export business in
Florida of selling long-range ballistic missile guidance components
to South Africa for at least the last year.
   In its affidavit against the company, York Ltd., the agency said
it was aware of ``projects under way relating to the development of
guided missile delivery systems for standard and nuclear weapons''
in South Africa.

<HEAD>Leaky Embargo Fails To Halt All Food, Supplies To Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six-week-old U.N. economic embargo
has not kept Iraq from receiving food and supplies by truck from
Jordan, jetliner from South America, via smugglers from Syria and
Iran, and even by mule from Turkey.
   The embargo has halted virtually all of Iraq's oil exports and
drastically reduced cargo shipments to the country, but supplies
are slipping in thanks to sympathetic governments, pro-Iraqi groups
and opportunistic smugglers.
   ``There are a lot of ways for an innovative shipper to avoid a
blockade, and as the price goes up, they become more innovative,''
said Capt. Paul Prokop, commander of U.S. Coast Guard teams
enforcing the embargo in the Persian Gulf.
   The amount of slippage is difficult to determine. Before Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting the international community to
impose the sanctions, it imported about three-quarters of its food
supplies.
   The trade cutoff has forced strict rationing, but embargo
violators may help Iraq resist the pressure aimed at forcing it to
quit Kuwait.
   While the United Nations authorized the naval blockade, the air
embargo it approved this week does not condone military enforcement
and little is being done to stop overland shipments through
neighboring Jordan and Iran.
   Jordan's King Hussein, an ally of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, has reluctantly agreed to honor the boycott but much food
is believed to be going in through Jordan.
   A convoy of trucks loaded with food left Jordan for Iraq on
Monday to raucous cheers in one of the more defiant gestures
flouting the embargo.
   Western officials believe Libya, Sudan and Yemen are also
sending food.
   Most aircraft flying to Iraq would have to cross Jordanian
airspace, possibly filing bogus flight plans for Jordan, then
continuing to Iraq.
   Iran has a 730-mile border with Iraq and is believed to be
allowing food across overland routes.
   Officially, Iran says it supports the U.N. embargo. On Monday,
it announced the arrest of 29 people for smuggling rice, flour,
dates, oil and other foodstuffs into Iraq.
   But Tehran, Baghdad's foe in an eight-year war than ended in
1988, shares Iraq's opposition to the U.S. military presence in the
gulf, and there is heated internal debate over whether to help Iraq
beat the sanctions.
   Iranian newspapers have suggested that Tehran send
``humanitarian shipments'' of food and medicine, and there have
been reports that Iran has struck a deal with Iraq to trade refined
oil for food.
   Baghdad residents say food appearing recently in markets in the
Iraqi capital has come from neighboring Iran.
   Also, some shipping sources say Iraqi tankers are delivering oil
to ports in Iran by hugging the coastline and staying out of
international waters.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad, Iraq's major rival in the Arab
world, made a weekend trip to Iran to try to persuade leaders in
Tehran to better cooperate with international efforts to isolate
Iraq.
   But he was unable to obtain a pledge to abide by the U.N.
sanctions.
   There are also illegal food shipments from Turkey, which
strongly backs U.S. policy in the region. The number of trucks
carrying food into Iraq has tripled since the embargo was imposed,
Cumhuriyet, a major Turkish newspaper, reported over the weekend.
   It quoted the owner of a meat exporting firm as saying Turkish
trucks carrying cattle to Iran were diverted to Iraq by Iranian
border guards.
   Other Turkish media reports say smugglers carry contraband
foodstuff by mule across the mountainous border region, which is
difficult to police and notorious for such activity.
   Small-scale smuggling from Syria also has been reported in
recent weeks, consisting mainly of opportunisic farmers selling
their produce across the common border.
   Even the air embargo adopted Tuesday by a 14-1 vote at the U.N.
Security Council is largely symbolic, as it cannot be effectively
enforced. The United Nations does not allow the shooting down of
civilian passenger aircraft.
   In one brazen example of defying the sanctions, an Argentinian
presidential adviser on Saturday acknowledged sending 154 tons of
beef to Iraq over the past two weeks.
   President Carlos Menem fired the adviser, Alberto Samid, for the
embarrassing admission, made more acute because Argentina has
pledged two warships to the multinational force standing up to
Saddam in the gulf region.
   Samid said the beef was flown to Iran for overland delivery to
Iraq, although Iran's Foreign Ministry claimed no knowledge of the
deal.
   But experts say Saddam cannot rely on airlifts to feed his
nation of 17 million people. Nor will his order this week to
farmers to devote 80 percent of their land to wheat help much,
according to U.S. Agriculture Department officials.

   Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
replaced Bennington College of Vermont as the nation's most
expensive college, with total expenses nearly $23,000 a year, a
survey shows.
   Overall, college costs this fall rose an average of 5 percent to
8 percent, continuing a six-year moderating trend, according to the
annual College Board survey released Wednesday.
   But with a possible recession and resurgent inflation, some
college officials fear tuition may climb more sharply in the next
few years.
   The survey found that fixed charges at four-year private
institutions, including tuition, fees, room and board, average
$13,544 - an 8 percent increase from last year's $12,557. The
increase a year ago was 9 percent.
   The priciest such school, MIT, costs an estimated $22,945,
counting tuition, fees, room and board, books and supplies,
transportation and other expenses.
   Bennington, a small, selective liberal arts college, had been
the most expensive private college every year since the 1985-86
school year; MIT was tops for the three years before that.
   This year, Bennington is fifth at $22,550. Yale University is
second at $22,900, New York University third at $22,775 and
Brandeis University fourth at $22,690.
   Rounding out the top 10, in order, are Harvard and Radcliffe
colleges, Boston University, Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia
University and Stanford University. All cost more than $22,000 a
year.
   Several of the highest-priced schools, however, posted some of
their smallest tuition increases in years. Columbia's rates were up
just 5.7 percent, Stanford's 5.25 percent.
   At four-year public universities, fixed costs including room and
board average $4,970, up 5 percent from $4,715.
   At two-year private colleges, fixed costs including room and
board average $8,484, up 7 percent from $7,912 last year.
   Tuition and fees at two-year public institutions average $884,
up 5 percent from last year's $841. Few such institutions provide
room and board.
   The survey's averages are weighted to take enrollment into
account. Colleges with large enrollments count more heavily than
smaller schools.
   At their worst, costs at public and private institutions rose in
double digits from 1981 through 1984. Rates at four-year public
colleges shot up 20 percent in 1982-83. They settled into the 5
percent to 9 percent range the past six years.
   Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities in Washington, labeled the
moderation in cost increases ``progress, though not dramatic.''
   ``We'd never expect to see the increases fall sharply,'' he
said.
   But resurgent inflation and a looming recession could upset the
pattern, Rosser said. Universities in Northern states, especially,
will probably feel the pinch of rising oil prices.
   Arthur Hauptman, author of the recently published book ``The
College Tuition Spiral,'' agreed.
   ``Assuming there is a decent jump in inflation, I would expect
that this would lead to tuitions not further reducing themselves,
and they might well go up, though not as fast as the overall
inflation rate,'' said Hauptman, a consultant to the American
Council on Education.
   He added that a recession might cause sharper tuition hikes at
public universities especially, since economic downturns often
prompt states to cut education spending.
   In response to the survey, U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F.
Cavazos urged parents to save money and familiarize themselves with
financial aid sources.
   ``While the rapid rise of college costs experienced in the 1980s
has slowed, many still perceive these costs as beyond their
financial reach,'' he said in a statement.
   Nearly half of all families with college-age students receive
public or private loans and grants, which totaled about $28 billion
last year, the College Board said.
   The College Board is a private, non-profit education association
whose members include more than 2,600 colleges, school systems and
other education associations.

<HEAD>Democrats Taking a Long Shot at Capturing Another Seat Once Held
By
Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The battle for Dan Quayle's old Senate
seat pits well-financed Republican incumbent Dan Coats against an
obscure state legislator who took a 400-mile hike to meet Indiana
voters.
   Baron Hill won the Democratic nomination to challenge Coats only
after two better-known Democrats decided not to run.
   Coats, a former congressman, has a comfortable lead over Hill in
recent polls and a $900,000 bank balance heading into the fall
campaign.
   Hill, a businessman at a family-owned insurance and real estate
agency, is short on campaign money.
   The flamboyant Hill resorted to literally walking the campaign
trail, hiking north from the Ohio River to Lake Michigan, where he
dived into 60-degree water.
   ``Whatever happens, this has been a great experience for me,''
Hill said as he dried off.
   Hill's camp disputes polling daa showing Coats with a wide
lead.
   ``That's nuts,'' said Tim Phillips, the Democrat's campaign
manager who says the undecided vote is actually above 40 percent.
   Coats was appointed to the Senate seat last year after Quayle
resigned to become vice president. State law required a special
election this year. The winner will face re-election in 1992, the
year Quayle's term was to expire.
   In a March 1989 special election for Coats' congressional seat,
Democrat Jill Long captured the heavily Republican district, which
had once been held by Quayle. Long's victory stunned GOP chairman
Lee Atwater and others in the party.
   ``Hill and Jill, Democrats in 1990,'' reads a political slogan
summarizing Democrats' hopes.
   Hill attacked Coats early for supposedly lavish office expenses
and taking generous advantage of the franking privilege to send
voters millions of pieces of mail. A Hill television spot showed a
farmer opening his mailbox only to be blown back by a rushing
torrent of Coats mailings.
   A radio spot even offhandedly suggested the mailings posed an
environmental threat by clogging landfills.
   That didn't stop the Coats mailings. But the senator soon took
the offensive on an environmental issue, sponsoring legislation to
stop out-of-state trash haulers, many identified as New Jersey
haulers, from using Indiana landfills.
   Hill's TV spot ``grabbed enough voter attention to put Coats on
the defensive,'' said political pollster Brian S. Vargus. ``So
Coats came back with his New Jersey garbage men.''
   Coats lately has concentrated on employing the perks and powers
of incumbency to woo support.
   The out-of-state trash legislation passed Sept. 18, and two days
later Coats upstaged the opposition by handing the Democratic mayor
of Gary, Ind., a $2.5 million check for an airport expansion. He's
even scrounged for money to save a local Army Reserve center.
   Coats is better known than Hill, but hasn't proven he can draw
voters outside his former congressional district.
   ``I'm pretty well convinced that a large proportion of the
electorate aren't even aware at this point there's an election in
November,'' says Vargus.
   Coats has struggled to build the loyal following he will need to
win if voter turnout is low.
   ``Name recognition does not always translate into political
recognition,'' says Vargus, a sociologist at Indiana
University-Purdue University at Indianapolis who predicted Quayle's
largely unexpected Senate victory in 1980. ``Even if (supporters)
say they approve, they don't necessarily vote.''
   The upset victory of Boston University president John Silber
over former state attorney general Francis Bellotti in the
Democratic primary for governor raises warning flags for incumbents
everywhere, says Vargus,
   ``Lightning can strike, that does prove it,'' said Vargus.

<HEAD>House Approves $2.5 Billion for Water Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation authorizing new water projects for
flood control, storm damage reduction, inland navigation and port
development in 18 states and Puerto Rico is heading to a conference
committee.
   A bill approved 350-55 by the House on Wednesday will be taken
up by a joint House-Senate panel soon to blend with similar
legislation passed by the Senate.
   However, the $2.5 billion package of 25 Army Corps of Engineers
water projects still must get over some other hurdles before work
can begin.
   The projects are to be joint state-federal efforts, but no
federal money has been appropriated yet, and President Bush has
threatened to veto the bill in its present form.
   By far the most expensive project in the House bill is a $1.2
billion flood control effort in New Jersey that would divert waters
from the northern Passaic Valley into Newark Bay.
   The project, with an estimated federal cost of $890 million,
calls for construction of two large tunnels to divert water,
modifications to the channels of the Passaic River and its
tributaries and construction of levees and floodwalls.
   Rep. Robert A. Roe of Wayne, N.J., ranking member of the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee, hailed passage as a
``major step in protecting the lives and property of the residents
of the Passaic River Valley.''
   A 1984 flood in the area cost three lives, forced the evacuation
of 9,000 residents and caused an estimated $355 million in damage
to homes and businesses.
   Flood tunnel opponents have urged the federal government to buy
the property. But several New Jersey members of Congress say the
purchase would cost about $4.6 billion, three times more than the
flood tunnel.
   Another major project in the bill is a $545 million flood
control effort in the Buffalo Bayou and its tributaries in Texas,
encompassing most of the Houston metropolitan area.
   As an authorization bill, the measure does not directly result
in expenditures. In order for the authorized money to be spent, it
must be appropriated later in other legislation.
   The Bush administration has threatened to veto the bill for a
number of reasons, including environmental and economic feasibility
of some of the projects.
   The administration also opposes federal responsibility for
developing recreation facilities, replacing a bridge, levee
beautification and agricultural land improvements required in some
of the projects.
   Other projects authorized in the bill are:
   -Navigation work for Bayou La Batre, Ala.
   -Storm damage prevention in Homer Spit, Alaska.
   -Flood control on the San Francisco River at Clifton, Ariz.
   -Flood control on Nogales Wash in Nogales, Ariz.
   -Flood control for Coyote and Berryessa Creeks in Santa Clark
County, Calif.
   -Navigation and storm damage reduction in Oceanside Harbor,
Calif.
   -Navigation of Ventura Harbor in California.
   -Storm damage reduction in Martin County, Fla.
   -Navigation in Miami Harbor Channel, Fla.
   -Navigation in the McAlpine Lock and Dam in Indiana and
Kentucky.
   -Flood control in Fort Wayne, Ind., involving the St. Mary's and
Maumee Rivers.
   -Flood control for Aloha-Rigolette, La.
   -Navigation in Boston Harbor.
   -Flood control in Ecorse Creek in Wayne County, Mich.
   -Navigation in the Great Lakes Connecting Channel and Harbors in
Michigan and Minnesota.
   -Flood control in Coldwater Creek in Missouri.
   -Flood control in River Des Peres in Missouri.
   -Flood control in Rio De Le Plata in Puerto Rico.
   -Storm damage reduction in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   -Multiple purpose project in the Ray Roberts Lake in Texas.
   -Flood control in the Upper Jordan River in Utah.
   -Flood control at Buena Vista, Va.
   -Flood control in Petersburg, W.Va.

<HEAD>Oppression of Opponents Continues in Zaire, Amnesty Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces in Zaire continue to violently
repress government opponents despite recent promises to expand the
one-party political system and make other reforms, Amnesty
International charged today.
   Although abuses have diminished in recent years, incidents of
banishment, torture, and detentions without charge or trial are
coming to light, the international human rights group said in a
report.
   ``Appeals to the government to investigate these incidents have
been ignored and the authorities have shown themselves unwilling to
take disciplinary action against (security forces),'' the group
said.
   The government of President Mobutu Sese Seko, which has ruled
the central African country since 1965, last spring promised a
series of political reforms.
   In April, Mobutu made a series of improvements, including giving
citizens the right to form opposition political parties and trade
unions.
   In May, he promised an end to internal banishment and
incommunicado detention, and the release of all uncharged political
prisoners - pledges which remain unfulfilled, said the London-based
organization.
   ``The Zairean security services, which are directly responsible
to the president, maintain extensive powers to arrest and detain
political suspects and hold them in arbitrary and incommunicado
detention, where many have been ill-treated and tortured,'' Amnesty
said.
   Security forces involved in the abuses include a special service
responsible for immigration, an elite presidential guard and a
paramilitary police group which helps to control borders, it said.
   Since January 1988, Amnesty has received reports of several
hundred people arrested and imprisoned for political reasons, the
report says.
   Most of those targeted are members of the opposition Union for
Democracy and Social Progress. In July, more than 12 members were
arrested and some were allegedly beaten while holding a meeting,
said the human rights group. It did not detail whether the members
were detained.
   Security forces have also killed government opponents, the
report says.
   Most recently, the forces were implicated in the reported
killing of at least 12 students on May 11-12 at Lubumbashi
University, it says.
   The government initially denied responsibility for the killings,
but a parliamentary inquiry led to the arrests of the governor of
the Shaba region and other government officials.
   Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler, has called for an
international investigation of the incident and Zaire's refusal has
helped sour relations between the countries, Amnesty said.
   In addition, at least five students were reportedly killed in
February 1989 when soldiers dispersed unarmed demonstrators at
Kinshasa, said the report.

<HEAD>Senate Kills `Motor Voter' Registration Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has effectively killed the ``motor
voter'' bill, which would link voter registration to filling out
applications for drivers licenses.
   The Senate voted 55-42 Wednesday to limit debate on the question
of whether to take up the legislation. The margin was five votes
short of the 60 needed.
   ``The Senate will revisit this measure in the next Congress,''
said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the chief sponsor.
   It provides that individuals would automatically be registered
as voters when applying for drivers licenses. To avoid becoming
registered, they could check off a box designated for that purpose
on the license application.
   State governments would have to use the same forms to license
drivers and register voters.
   Voters also could register through the mail and at the offices
of various federal agencies.
   Backers of the measure say the needy and unsophisticated are
discouraged by difficult and overly complex registration procedures
in many communities.
   Critics say the legislation could lead to voter fraud. They
questioned whether safeguards would be effective which are designed
to verify that those who register actually live where they say they
do.
   Democratic leaders wanted a time limit on debate, fearing that
the bill's largely Republican critics would talk it to death by
filibustering with only a few weeks left in this year's
congressional session.
   Among Republicans, only Oregon Sens. Mark Hatfield and Bob
Packwood voted in favor of taking up the bill. Three others did not
vote, Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota, Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky and Pete Wilson of California.
   All other Republicans were opposed while the measure was
supported by all but two Democrats, Sens. Max Baucus of Montana,
and Howell Heflin of Alabama.
   Similar legislation was passed by the House on Feb. 6 with
bipartisan support.
   Next year, Ford will ``continue the fight to strengthen our
democratic process by making the voting booth more accessible to
all Americans,'' he said in a statement.
   Lawmakers acted out of ``fear that registering millions more
voters would upset the political status quo,'' League of Women
Voters President Susan S. Lederman said in a statement.
   ``I think voters will find it unacceptable that the same
legislators who argue so righteously for greater turnouts on
election day vote to kill the one bill that would make voter
registration fairer and simpler,'' she said.

   American taxpayers have paid $19.4 billion to
store oil in six underground salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas.
Now they will get their first payback.
   President Bush's decision Wednesday to tap the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve for 5 million barrels of oil in hopes of calming
soaring prices, is the first time the country's petroleum safety
net has been put to use.
   The reserve has a rocky history and its existence stems from
this country's first major oil shock - the Arab oil embargo in
1973-74 that first brought home to millions of Americans the
dangers of relying too heavily on foreign oil.
   It is the first use of the oil reserve as an economic weapon,
although the government tapped it for 1 million barrels of crude in
1985 to test the system. A year later, the Reagan administration
used the threat of a drawdown to curtail a price spiral that was
occurring because of the Iran-Iraq war, industry analysts said.
   Congress authorized the petroleum reserve in 1975 and the first
drop of oil went into storage areas two years later. Over the
years, a series of salt caverns were excavated along the Texas and
Louisiana coasts to store the oil - 590 million barrels as of
today.
   Creation of the reserve has been a massive undertaking. Early
oil shipments went into abandoned salt mines. When those were
filled, the caverns were carved out of rock-hard salt through
massive injection of water. Oil does not dissolve salt, so the salt
created a permanent subterranean enclosure.
   A typical cavern is 2,500 feet high and 246 feet wide - about as
wide and more than twice as tall as the World Trade Center in New
York City.
   Creation of the reserve has not been without its problems and
controversies. Originally envisioned to cost $6 billion to $7
billion, the price tag is close to $20 billion and rising. Congress
recently voted to enlarge the reserve from a maximum of 750 million
barrels to 1 billion barrels by the end of the decade.
   There have been huge cost overruns and delays. Originally the
reserve was scheduled to have been full by this year; instead, it
is about 150 million barrels short of the goal.
   Over the years there have been charges of fraud and
mismanagement, millions of dollars of equipment missing,
allegations that inferior oil - even toxic waste - was being put
into the salt caverns. The government was accused of paying
inflated prices for oil.
   When oil was cheap briefly in the late 1970s, the government
wanted to speed up filling the reserve but couldn't build new
caverns fast enough to take advantage of the low price.
   And when the second oil shock hit in 1979 with the fall of the
shah in Iran, prices soared and the Carter administration suspended
purchases for the reserve altogether.
   The Reagan administration repeatedly sparred with Congress over
how much oil to put into the reserve. In 1984, the administration
sought to again halt purchases, arguing that petroleum was too
expensive and the purchases were a drain on the budget. Congress
disagreed.
   Today, the reserve holds 590 million barrels of oil, enough to
supply the country for 73 days should there be a total cutoff of
oil imports.
   The government must buy oil on the open market for the reserve.
Much of it has come from Mexico and British fields in the North
Sea. Only 6.6 percent is domestically produced.
   The salt caverns are connected by a maze of pipelines that can
be directly connected to commercial refinery distribution systems.
Officials said it would take 16 days for the Energy Department to
award oil contracts under an auction system.
   The reserve can make available 3.5 million barrels of oil a day
when in full operation. Bush has only asked for 5 million barrels
as a test designed to send a signal to the petroleum markets,
according to officials.

<HEAD>Bush Pushes for Progress in Clean Air Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is warning that hard-fought
clean air legislation may fall apart unless Congress steps up
efforts to work out a compromise.
   The president Wednesday bemoaned the slow progress of
House-Senate negotiations on a final clean air package and offered
a compromise proposal ``to help break the logjam that once again
has appeared.''
   House and Senate members have been struggling since early July
to resolve differences in separate clean air bills that won
overwhelming approval in each chamber earlier this year.
   The legislation, which calls for tough new air pollution
controls on factories, electric utilities and automobiles,
represents the first tightening of federal air pollution laws in 13
years.
   But the talks have bogged down on details of the massive
legislation.
   In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate negotiating
teams, the president said the talks have strayed away from what the
administration wants and that ``the slow progress ... may
jeopardize enactment'' of a bill before Congress adjourns next
month.
   The administration's new plan took provisions from both the
House and Senate bills, did not contain any new initiatives.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House delegation,
said he wondered why the administration didn't send up the proposal
when the issue was before the House last spring.
   Environmentalists also were not impressed by the White House
initiative. ``They picked the weakest part of each bill except on
acid rain,'' said Daniel Weiss, who has followed the clean air
debate for the Sierra Club.
   Administration officials said their new proposal was $3 billion
cheaper than either the House or Senate bill. The White House all
along has expressed concern about the cost of the wide-reaching air
pollution controls, estimating that both the Senate and House
versions will cost industry more than $25 billion a year when all
the new requirements take effect.
   While there is general agreement between both the House and
Senate on tough new controls to reduce acid rain, toxic industrial
chemical releases and urban smog, disagreements remain on details
in each of these areas.
   ``We're concerned that they're not taking action fast enough,''
said William Rosenberg, an assistant administrator at the
Environmental Protection Agency. He characterized the
administration proposal as an attempt to ``bridge the gap'' between
the House and Senate.
   A White House official acknowledged that the proposal in part
was an attempt to get the Bush administration more closely involved
in the clean air discussions on Capitol Hill.
   ``The president has been frozen out in the process and the
results have been stalemated,'' said the official, who spoke under
the condition that he not be named. He said the view from the White
House was that ``the clock is ticking and the conferees were not
delivering.''
   Earlier this month the negotiators announced a tentative
agreement on reducing smog-causing pollution from industrial
sources and on permitting requirements for industry. Previously
they reached agreement on how to deal with chemicals that damage
the atmospheric ozone layer.
   But the two sides have yet to take up in detail a number of
other controversial issues including how far to go to ensure the
public protection from toxic chemical releases by industry and
whether to provide job-loss assistance to workers who become
unemployed because of the tougher pollution controls.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, contradicting the
defense that got him acquitted in 1987, conceded he stuck his gun
in a wounded teen-ager's ribs and shot him, telling the victim:
``You don't look too bad, here's another.''
   Goetz, in a deposition released Wednesday, also undercut defense
attorney Barry Slotnick's assertion at trial that the gunman never
hesitated between shots when he opened fire on four young men in a
subway car in 1984.
   Goetz, who is white, also acknowledged making racist comments
before the day he shot the black teen-agers.
   The deposition is part of a $50 million lawsuit filed against
Goetz by one of his victims, Darrell Cabey, 22.
   ``I hope the jurors in that trial wake up screaming in the night
when they read this,'' said attorney William Kunstler, who
questioned Goetz for Cabey.
   Cabey was left paralyzed and brain damaged by Goetz. The three
other youths recovered and were later arrested on various criminal
charges. Goetz asserts he fired because the four were about to mug
him.
   Goetz, 42, was acquitted of attempted murder, assault and other
charges. He served 8{ months in jail for a weapons offense.
   He never testified at his trial, answering questions under oath
Monday for the first time about the shootings.
   Goetz said he was on the subway less than 30 seconds before
opening fire with his .38-caliber revolver. Kunstler asked Goetz
about the last shot he fired at Cabey, who was struggling to get
out of a seat.
   ``I walked directly in front of that person, put the gun in his
ribs, and pulled the trigger again with the words, `You don't look
too bad, here's another,' '' Goetz replied.
   After his arrest in New Hampshire, he was videotaped by police
as giving a similar account.
   Slotnick had argued at Goetz's trial that his client
``fantasized'' making that statement. Slotnick also argued that
Goetz emptied his gun rapid-fire without pause, meaning he could
not have spoken to anyone before firing.
   ``The mind of Bernhard Goetz, full of stress and fear, might
have recounted a lot of things that didn't actually happen,''
Slotnick told the jury.
   Goetz specifically repudiated that and said he stood by all the
statements he made on the New Hampshire video. He had also told
police there he wanted to gouge out the eyes of one of his victims.
   Goetz also was asked by Ronald Kuby, Cabey's co-counsel, ``Did
you say at a block meeting or community meeting or building
meeting, in words or substance, `The only way we are going to clean
up the street is to get rid of the spics and niggers?' ''
   ``Yes I did,'' Goetz responded. ``That was at a community
meeting.''
   Cabey's lawyers believe this demonstrates racism was at play
when Goetz opened fire.
   The youths said they didn't plan to rob Goetz and that they were
only panhandling for money to play video games.
   Goetz also discussed his finances. His defense fund collected
about $60,000 in donations. His annual income since the shooting
has dropped from as high as $100,000 to about $20,000, and his
assets are down from $250,000 to $6,000.

<HEAD>Only Two Eligible to Vote on Montgomery County Ballot Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURTONSVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's a political prediction that can
be taken to the bank: Question J on the Montgomery County, Md.,
ballot will pass Nov. 6 - overwhelmingly.
   One elderly couple, who are the only voters eligible to cast
ballots on the issue, guarantee it.
   Sometime before polls close Nov. 6, Montgomery County elections
administrator Doug Jernigan will type out two ballots and
personally deliver them to Martin and Mildred Darnall.
   Those ballots will be unique because they'll be the only ones
containing Question J, which would put the Hitching Post Restaurant
back into Prince George's County.
   Since the Darnalls are the only property owners affected, they
are the only eligible voters.
   While the ballot question is not the most burning issue of the
political season, for Mrs. Darnall it'll mean a chance to putter
around the garden.
   The Darnalls have owned the combination cafe-liquor store near
Burtonsville, Md., for more than 41 years, and they've been ready
to retire for four years now.
   ``I got sick. I had a real bad time. I was a cancer patient,''
recalled Mrs. Darnall, 73, in a telephone interview. ``With our age
and the physical handicaps, we thought we should sell. We had
numerous buyers just hollering to buy the place.''
   But when negotiations began to get serious, Mrs. Darnall and her
75-year-old husband were shocked to learn their establishment was
part of Montgomery County.
   For nearly four decades the Darnalls thought they were part of
Prince George's County. They paid taxes to Prince George's County,
they were registered to vote in Prince George's and their liquor
license was issued by Prince George's County.
   But in the early 1980s, there was a slight shifting on the
boundary between the two counties, and the Darnalls weren't
informed.
   The difference is significant for would-be buyers. Montgomery's
zoning and liquor control ordinances are much stricter than
neighboring Prince George's. Instead of making an easy sale, the
Darnalls became frustrated as one prospective buyer after another
lost interest after learning they would be subject to Montgomery
County regulations.
   So the Darnalls enlisted the help of state Delegate Sheila Ellis
Hixson, D-Montgomery, who pushed a bill through the General
Assembly last spring that put Question J on the ballot.
   There's no doubt how the Darnalls will vote; Mrs. Darnall is
more concerned now about getting another buyer given the area's
current real estate slump.
   While she refused to reveal the asking price, other sources say
the property is worth slightly more than $1 million. ``There have
been no complaints on the price. Except now, nobody has any
money,'' Mrs. Darnall said.
   If the couple is able to unload their business, Mrs. Darnall has
her retirement planned.
   ``I'd just like to one time in my life to have a house, a garden
and just live a normal life. I just wanted to be a harried
homeowner.''

<HEAD>Bernard Sanders Calls for Troop Reductions in The Middle East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard Sanders, the avowed Socialist who
is running for Congress, is calling for U.S. troop reductions in
the Middle East.
   Sanders said President Bush deserves credit for his initial
handling of the crisis, adding that he supports having other
countries contribute more to the multinational force to prevent
Iraq from further expansion.
   ``It is impossible, of course, to estimate what an effective
U.N.'' (United Nations) force would number, but my initial guess
would be that it would not be necessary for the U.S. to have more
than'' 40,000 to ``50,000 troops in the region,'' said Sanders. His
answers were in response to questions from three Vermont
newspapers.
   In an interview Wednesday, Sanders said he would ``like to see
... replacement of American troops with troops from Europe.''
   ``I would like to see more of a presence from'' France and
England, he said.
   Sanders, a former four-term mayor of Burlington, is running
against first-term incumbent Rep. Peter Smith, a Republican.
Sanders is running as an independent.
   About 165,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in the Saudi desert
and aboard ships in the region. Thousands of Arab and European
troops have also been deployed as part of the U.S.-led
multinational force.

   Vice President Quayle completed a
two-day California tour a week after President Bush visited the
state, and their appearances raised more than $2.3 million for
local Republicans.
   Most of the money goes to Pete Wilson for his tight
gubernatorial race against Dianne Feinstein, a campaign Republicans
consider vital because the next governor will have a strong say in
drawing congressional districts.
   ``This is our No. 1 race in the country: to elect Pete Wilson as
governor of the state of California,'' Quayle told about 500
members of the Los Angeles Republican Federation of Women on
Wednesday.
   Quayle's fund-raising stops raised as much as $150,000 for the
state GOP and another $150,000 for state Sen. Marian Bergeson's
campaign for lieutenant governor, said California Republican Party
spokesman Dan Schnur.
   This followed Bush's appearances last week in San Francisco and
Los Angeles that raised about $2 million for Wilson.

   California's Republican candidate for
governor threatened to ``fight fire with fire'' and crank up fund
raising like his Democratic opponent after a judge threw out limits
on campaign contributions.
   Democrat Dianne Feinstein's staff began telling supporters
Wednesday they can exceed the state's voter-approved limits because
of the judge's ruling.
   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is thought to have a fund-raising
lead over Feinstein, challenged the former San Francisco mayor to
abide by the limits despite the ruling. But he left open the
possibility he also would exceed them.
   ``We may have to fight fire with fire,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton on Tuesday struck down as
unconstitutional Proposition 73, approved by voters in 1988. It
allowed an individual to give up to $1,000 per candidate per fiscal
year. It set higher limits for parties and political action
committees.
   Dee Dee Myers, a spokeswoman for Feinstein, said Wilson, as a
senator, had been able to set up a network of individual
contributors.
   ``We're not going to abide by fund-raising limits that have been
thrown out as unconstitutional because it's in Pete Wilson's
advantage to do so,'' she said. ``He obviously has an interest in
locking in the status quo.''
   Meanwhile, state officials urged a delay of the ruling, which
came six weeks before the Nov. 6 election.
   The state Fair Political Practices Commission asked Karlton to
suspend his decision pending an appeal, saying the ruling so close
to the election would give an advantage to candidates ``who can
raise large sums on short notice.''
   Karlton refused to suspend the ruling immediately. Instead, he
scheduled a hearing on the motion for Friday.
   State Sen. Quentin Kopp and Assembly Minority Leader Ross
Johnson, authors of the contribution limits, asked an appeals court
to delay the judge's ruling, saying the ``integrity of the
electoral process'' could be at stake.
   Wilson, who had only token opposition in the June primary,
reported raising $12.5 million through June and said he had $3.9
million in the bank as of July 1. Feinstein raised $8.1 million in
the same period and had only $645,344 left after defeating state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp in the primary.
   Spokesman for both candidates claimed not to know how much had
been raised since June.
   The California governor's race has been targeted as a top
priority of both national political parties because of the
governor's authority to sign or veto the congressional
redistricting bill the 1991 Legislature must enact.
   California is expected to gain seven seats in Congress based on
the 1990 census, boosting its delegation to 52 seats. Leaders of
both parties say control of 10 or more of those seats could be
determined by which party occupies the governor's office.

   About the only thing getting a
trim at Charlene's House of Beauty these days is Charlene's
profits.
   For Charlene Luongo and other merchants who rely on the adjacent
Marine base for their livelihood, the Persian Gulf crisis delivered
a one-two punch: first the town lost thousands of Marines, then it
lost many of their wives and girlfriends.
   ``The way I understand it, they went home to mama,'' said Ms.
Luongo, her beauty chair empty at midday. ``I've lost about 50
percent of my business.''
   The military won't give numbers, but business officials guess at
least 6,000 Marines left for Saudi Arabia. About 12,500 people live
in Twentynine Palms and a like number at the Marine Corps Training
Center, the nation's biggest Marine base.
   With such a large bite taken out of the local population, signs
of change are everywhere in this Mojave Desert city, 140 miles east
of Los Angeles in high desert terrain of jagged ridges and hills
dotted with Joshua trees.
   Streets are quieter, many parking lots are vacant, and
everywhere, there's yellow ribbon.
   Yellow ribbons are tied on front door handles, taped to display
windows and attached to car attennas. Even the gate to the pet
motel on the outskirts of town has yellow ribbon fluttering in the
warm desert wind.
   ``The Marines are very much a part of this community,'' said Ed
Haley, a retired Marine and owner of Twentynine Palms Liquor, where
business is off 25 percent. ``They're sort of missed. We do want to
see more get here. And we hope to get the others get back.''
   Though shopkeepers are trying to remain optimistic, business is
down at least 20 percent at many stores, according to the Chamber
of Commerce. Merchants fear that unless the military sends more
troops to the base, some shops will close before year's end.
   ``The important thing is what the next step is going to be,''
said Bill Gutgesell, the city's community development director.
``Is it going to stay in limbo like this, or will they complement
the activity on the base and supply it with more reserves? Of
course, they don't tell us anything.''
   First and hardest hit were the businesses that cater directly to
the Marines: tattoo parlors, bars, nightclubs, tire stores, barber
shops that advertise regulation cuts, and laundries with specials
for uniforms.
   Other businesses also are feeling the pinch: women's clothing
shops, convenience markets, gas stations and fast-food restaurants.
The $150-per-ceremony wedding chapel, packed with couples in the
early days of the deployment, stands empty, save for the white
benches and peach bows.
   Mayor Lester W. Krushat said the loss of troops has yet to be
felt on the tax base of this young city, incorporated in 1987.
``But time will tell,'' he said.
   City leaders here are quick to point out that theirs is more
than just a Marine base community.
   They say many residents are retirees, drawn by the warm, dry
weather, clean air and friendly neighbors. The city also is near
the Joshua Tree National Monument, a camping destination. In
October, the town celebrates Pioneer Days, an old-time, Western
festival.
   ``Yes, business is down, but we'll survive,'' said Karen Van den
Hout, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. ``Our main
concern is that these guys (troops) are supported, that they know
it, and that they get back in one piece.''
   The deployment, many residents say, has been hardest on the
young wives and girlfriends - the women without children or any
strong ties to the community.
   The military sponsors counseling sessions and support groups for
the women, but many just packed up and went home to their parents.
Officials estimate at least 5 percent of the Marine dependents have
left town.
   ``To a young girl out here it seems a little difficult for them
because there's not the things to do that they're used to,'' said
Grace Jernigan at Something Special, an arts and crafts store.
   Something Special, owned by Jernigan's daughter, is one of the
few stores where business hasn't dropped. She said many women in
town are turning to such hobbies as needlepoint and quilt-making.
   ``It's good therapy,'' said Jernigan. ``If you keep your mind
off things. You're not sitting around worried all the time.''

<HEAD>Juan Pons Triumphs Over Tragedy in `Rigoletto'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No other version planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN STEINBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was triumph over tragedy for baritone Juan
Pons, who portrayed the title role in the first of 11 performances
of ``Rigoletto'' by the Metropolitan Opera this season.
   Pons stood out among the cast Wednesday night as the hunchbacked
court buffoon in Giuseppe Verdi's tragic masterpiece. So what if he
shouldn't have stood so straight? His voice was great.
   He sounded convincingly tormented in his Act 1 solo after he is
cursed.
   Particularly compelling was his duet at the end of Act 2 with
soprano June Anderson, who portrayed Rigoletto's daughter, Gilda.
   Although Miss Anderson had some trouble with the high notes
throughout the night, her Act 1 solo, especially the cadenza and
trill just before Gilda's abduction, was just heavenly.
   The story, based on Victor Hugo's play ``Le roi s'amuse,'' is
set in 16th century Italy and begins at the Duke of Mantua's
palace. What's supposed to be an orgy led by the womanizing duke
actually seemed a bit tame in the Otto Schenk production.
   The duke already has seduced the daughter of Count Monterone,
paws the wife of a courtier, and lusts for the maiden he has
spotted in church. Monterone bursts into the party and after being
derided by Rigoletto responds by vowing ``maledetto'' - revenge.
   After the duke finds out the maiden is his jester's daghter,
she is abducted - with the unwitting help of Rigoletto. Cries the
clown: ``Ah! La maledizione!'' (the curse).
   Gilda is carried back to the palace, is conquered by the duke,
and tells all to her father. Still, she says, she loves the duke.
Rigoletto eventually hires an assassin to kill his employer, but
his daughter is murdered instead after the assassin's sister
Maddelena is courted by the duke.
   Bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, as the unscrupulous hitman Sparafucile,
gave a brawny performance; Wendy White was an especially tempting
Maddelena; and the boyish conductor Guido Ajmone-Marsan did a firm
job melding the large ensemble in his Metropolitan Opera debut.
   Somewhat disappointing was tenor Jerry Hadley as the Duke of
Mantua. He's a good actor, but he sounded nasal at times. He got
off to a weak start with the aria ``Questa o quella,'' and during
the opera's most famous aria, ``La donna e mobile'' in Act 3, his
voice just didn't project.
   Baritone Alan Held, who played Monterone, had the opposite
problem. His voice was solid, but his acting was a bit wooden,
especially when he cast the hex on Rigoletto.
   The scenery, slightly different than last year's, was realistic
and the sky looked especially ominous.
   The Met's other performances of ``Rigoletto'' are Sept. 29, Oct.
3, 6, 16, 20, 23, 26, Jan. 4, 9, and 12.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange sank on
Thursday to a 21-month low, while the dollar closed slightly higher
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 478.71 points, or 2.15
percent, to post 21,478.71 points at the close of the day's
trading, its lowest closing level since Jan. 4, 1988. Volume was
430 million shares.
   The index on Wednesday shed 1,108.70 points, or 4.75 percent, in
its ninth largest single-day decline.
   The dollar closed at 137.50 yen, up 0.10 yen from Wednesday's
close. The currency opened at 137.48 yen, and dealing ranged
between 137.40 yen and 138.10 yen.
   On the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 8.685 percent by 3 p.m. (2 a.m.
EDT), down slightly from Wednesday's record high 8.690-percent
finish. The price was higher at 80.81 points, up from 80.73.
   Traders blamed the early morning stock market decline on selling
by individual investors. The traders said brokers called in loans
after Wednesday's steep fall, meaning investors had to sell shares
to raise money they had borrowed to buy stocks.
   Also affecting the market were New York's weak showing and news
that Iraq has threatened the death penalty for anyone hiding
foreigners in diplomatic embassies.
   ``The market started down and just slumped for much of the
morning,'' said Steve Usher, assistant general manager at Kleinwort
Benson International.
   ``Sentiment is very bad,'' said Hidetaka Yoshida of Kidder
Peabody International Corp.
   Pension funds began purchasing blue chips when the market hit a
morning low, traders said.
   The technical rebound represented a flight to quality by some
bargain-hunters who believe the market has bottomed out, Usher
said.
   A significant group of market players thinks there is more
downside to come, however. Roughly equal trading volumes before and
after the morning low suggest, he said, ``there is not much
conviction on either side.''
   Higher oil prices from Wednesday spurred pessimism in the
market. However, crude oil prices were falling in Asia on Thursday
in reaction to news that the United States would be selling 5
million barrels of its nearly 600 million-barrel strategic
petroleum reserve.
   The bad news about Iraq's threat, however, overwhelmed any
positive impact from the announcement, traders said.
   In Asia on Thursday morning, West Texas Intermediate crude oil
for December delivery was said to be sold at $1.15 a barrel
discount to its closing Wednesday New York Mercantile Exchange
level of $37.13 per barrel.
   The contract for November delivery of light sweet crude settled
at $38.67 Wednesday at the Merc.

<HEAD>Earthquake Experts Preach Calm After Shaker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW HAMBURG, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts preached calm after an
earthquake that rattled people in six states, saying it isn't
necessarily a precursor to the catastrophic Big One predicted for
December.
   No major damage or injuries were reported from Wednesday
morning's quake or a second, smaller one that night. The quakes,
felt in Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Indiana, were in the New Madrid Fault zone.
   For months, people along the seismic zone have been worrying
about scientist Iben Browning's contention that there's a 50-50
chance for a major quake there on or about Dec. 3. Many scientists
have dismissed the prediction.
   Doug Wiens, professor of earth and planetary sciences at
Washington University in St. Louis, said there is no extra cause
for alarm.
   ``I'm worried about this sort of hysterical tone that's come
out, where people are planning to take trips, close schools, close
businesses on December 3, because it is completely ridiculous,'' he
said.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake Wednesday
measured 4.6 on the Richter scale. The second was believed to be an
aftershock and measured a preliminary 3.0, said David Stewart,
director of the Center for Earthquake Studies in Cape Girardeau.
   Although the quakes were off the New Madrid Fault proper, they
fell within the fault zone.
   Each year, about 200 measurable quakes occur in the zone,
Stewart said, but only about three a year pack enough power to be
felt. In fact, before Wednesday, three were felt this year: a 2.8
quake on Jan. 9, a 3.1 on Aug. 7, and a 3.4 on Aug. 29.
   Said Stewart: ``We expect them every now and then. When they
happen, they normally mean nothing.''
   Although the quake was relatively minor, it was the second
largest in the New Madrid Fault zone this century, said Stewart.
The largest - 5.0 - hit in 1976 and was centered near Marked Tree,
Ark.
   A quake of magnitude 7.1 - which was mentioned in Browning's
predictions - would be about 3,000 times more powerful than a quake
of 4.6.
   Did Wednesday's shaker make residents more nervous?
   ``Of course it does, are you kidding?'' said Carolyn Tinsley,
who owns a video rental store in Scott City, about 10 miles from
the quake's epicenter of New Hamburg. ``I'd like to move if I
could.''
   In New Hamburg, a town of about 200 in the Missouri Bootheel,
students at the Kelso C-7 Elementary School felt the quake.
   ``It sounded like people moving their desks up on the second
floor,'' said eighth-grader John Koepp. ``I wasn't scared.''
   Moments before the temblor, teacher Donna Robert had been asking
a student whether her mother, who experienced a major earthquake in
Alaska, might be interested in coming to class to talk about
earthquakes.
   ``It was like the voice of God speaking. I couldn't believe
it,'' she said.
   In Dover, Tenn., Flossie Rouse said it felt like ``somebody was
taking the mattress and shaking it. Dishes and things in my china
cabinet were rattling like crazy. The whole house was shaking.''
   The New Madrid Fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., across
southeastern Missouri to southern Illinois. It's named for the town
of New Madrid, about 40 miles south of New Hamburg and 140 miles
southeast of St. Louis.
   In 1811-12, a series of quakes estimated up to 8 on the Richter
scale struck the New Madrid region, causing the Mississippi River
to appear to flow backward and ringing church bells in Washington,
D.C., more than 850 miles away.
   Browning, a climatologist and business consultant in New Mexico,
said there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake measuring 7.0 or
greater on or about Dec. 3. Browning was unavailable for comment
Wednesday, his secretary said.
   Browning said tidal forces coming to a head on or about Dec. 3
could unleash various kinds of geological violence around the
globe.
   Earthquake experts have for the most part dismissed his theory.
Wiens said experts have found no link between tidal forces and
earthquakes. In fact, tidal forces were low Wednesday.
   But school has been canceled for Dec. 3 in at least one district
in Arkansas. Vacations by city employees in Carbondale, Ill., have
been prohibited that week. Earthquake preparedness seminars have
been playing to packed crowds.
   The Mexico City earthquake in 1985 measured 8.1. Last October's
earthquake in San Francisco measured 7.1.

<HEAD>Study: Calcium Stops Bone Loss in Older Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of older women can keep their bones
strong and help avoid the crippling effects of osteoporosis simply
by consuming every day the amount of calcium contained in three
glasses of milk, a study today concludes.
   Osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease, is one of the most
common afflictions of growing old. It affects an estimated 15
million to 20 million Americans and primarily strikes women after
menopause, when their bodies make less estrogen.
   The research found that by bringing up calcium consumption to
the recommended daily allowance - 800 milligrams or the equivalent
of 24 ounces of milk - can completely stop the loss of bone in the
hips, wrist and spine after about age 55.
   ``The people who benefited most substantially were those who had
a low usual intake of calcium in their diets - under 400 milligrams
a day,'' said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, the study's director.
``That's about a serving and a half of calcium rich food. The
depressing thing is that millions of women in the United States in
this age group have an intake this low.''
   While older women are often advised to eat plenty of calcium,
some experts have doubted whether it really does prevent
osteoporosis.
   ``It's very important that they showed a calcium effect. That
should be trumpeted,'' commented Dr. Robert Recker of Creighton
University.
   Dawson-Hughes and colleagues conducted the study at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging
at Tufts University. It was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``Evidence is mounting that calcium matters,'' said
Dawson-Hughes. ``Here is the first real proof that it makes a
difference in older women.''
   According to a national survey, the average calcium consumption
among women over age 44 is 475 milligrams.
   Dairy products are a primary source of calcium, and a quart of
milk contains 1,200 milligrams. Other sources include dark green
vegetables such as broccoli, bony fish such as sardines, calcium
tablets and foods that are fortified with extra calcium.
   Women often lose bone rapidly after they go through menopause,
typically around age 50. The latest study found that adding calcuum
does nothing to prevent this during the first five years after
menopause. But by about age 55, enough calcium in the diet can stop
the erosion completely.
   Dr. William Peck, dean of Washington University medical school,
said that while the latest finding is important, women can still
benefit from estrogen supplements to preserve their bones
immediately after menopause.
   ``You don't want a women to think she can walk into the sunset
eating a lot of calcium,'' he said. ``She won't be protected.''
   The study was conducted on 301 women with low dietary calcium
intake. Doctors tested 500-milligram daily doses of two forms of
calcium - calcium carbonate, the type usually sold in calcium
supplements, and calcium citrate malate.
   Calcium citrate malate worked better, stopping loss of bone in
the spine, wrist and hip. Doctors said this form of calcium is
absorbed more readily, although women may be able to achieve the
same effect by taking larger doses of calcium carbonate.
   Calcium citrate malate is commercially available only in Citrus
Hill Plus Calcium brand of grapefruit and orange juice. Procter &amp;
Gamble, which makes the juices, co-sponsored the latest study with
the USDA. According to the company, 14 ounces of the juice contains
400 milligrams of calcium.
   Dawson-Hughes said she would like to see calcium citrate malate
made available in tablet form. However, she added, ``My first
choice for people to get their calcium is to use food sources,
because their general nutritional requirements are more likely to
be met than by popping pills.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says
Iraq's threat to execute foreigners hiding in diplomatic embassies
is ``repugnant'' and rejected a demand for the names of people
given sanctuary in the embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait.
   Asked about the threat Wednesday, Baker said: ``We've received a
note to that effect. It falls under the heading of the principle of
the three R's, I think,'' Baker continued. ``We've read it, it's
repugnant and we reject it.''
   The note was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   In Washington, however, Iraq's Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat
denied Wednesday night that any such threats have been made by
Iraqi officials.
   ``We're not threatening anyone,'' al-Mashat told reporters after
a meeting a the State Department. He refused further comment.
   Later, U.S. officials said al-Mashat, when asked about the Iraqi
warning note to the embassy, claimed to be unaware of its
existence. These officials spoke on condition that they not be
named.
   Some 300 to 350 U.S. citizens are stranded in Iraq, and an
additional 600 to 700 in Kuwait, according to figures released
Monday by the State Department.
   The department released this text of the Iraqi note from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
   ``Revolutionary Command Council Resolution No. 341 dated 8-26-90
stipulates that housing a foreigner for the purpose of hiding him
or her from the authorities is a crime of espionage. The punishment
of death shall be imposed on the individual who commits such a
crime.
   ``The ministry will appreciate it if the esteemed mission would
kindly inform the ministry of whether any of its citizens or any
other nation's citizens are residing in the mission's embassies and
your diplomatic residences, whether or not these citizens have
contracts with the government or are working with foreign companies
operating in Iraq.''
   The United States has refused to discuss whether non-diplomats
have been given refuge in the embassies.
   Iraq has been attempting to force foreign embassies in Kuwait to
shut down for more than a month, contending there is no need for
such operations because Kuwait is part of Iraqi territory.
   At the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, difficult conditions have
prevailed for the past five weeks because water and electricity
have been shut off and food supplies are scarce.
   During the meeting with al-Mashat, the U.S. officials also
demanded that Iraq allow the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait to function
normally by restoring water and electricity, the sources said.
   Earlier, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
criticized Iraq for refusing to provide the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
with the names of the 93 Americans Iraqi authorities have detained
for use as human shields to deter attacks against military
installations.

<HEAD>Pizza Hut Gets a Taste of Soviet Bureaucracy, With Pepperoni</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pizza Hut is trying to swallow a big slice of
Moscow bureaucracy, battling to keep its two new restaurants open
after health inspectors shut them, a company official says.
   Restaurant officials say the inspectors are unfamiliar with
modern technology such as automatic dishwashers, or Western ways of
preparing restaurant food, and that it's just a ``simple
misunderstanding.''
   The pizzerias, part of a $10 million joint venture between
PepsiCo. Inc.'s European branch and the Moscow city restaurant
department, opened Sept. 11, and feature American-style pizzas,
garlic bread and salad bars for both dollars and rubles.
   Since they opened, Soviets have waited in long lines to dine at
the red-and-white checkered tables, amid brass railings and fake
tropical plants.
   On Sept. 20, however, the larger of the two Pizza Huts on
Kutuzovsky Prospekt near a large foreigners' compound was shut down
for 2{ days. On Wednesday, the second one, on Gorky Street near the
Kremlin, also was closed.
   City sanitary inspector T. Piskaryova told the Tass news agency
that raw, semi-cooked and cooked food was found side-by-side, in
violation of city standards. The Pizza Huts also were found to lack
large sinks to wash dishes, as a backup to their automatic
dishwashers.
   Andrew Rafalat, the British-born deputy general director of the
restaurants, said Wednesday that he was surprised by the closures
and believes the inspectors are unfamiliar with Pizza Hut's
techniques.
   ``We've set up joint ventures to transfer new ways of running
restaurants, new technologies, new ways of training people, and
clearly what we're doing is very different from the Soviets,'' he
said in an interview at the reopened Kutuzovsky Prospekt restaurant
as Western-trained waiters scurried by with pans of pizza and trays
of soft drinks and beer.
   ``Now, I think that realization is just starting to dawn, and
when they find that our ways of doing things doesn't jell with
theirs, unfortunately the immediate reaction has been (to) close
down, which is kind of disappointing to us, because ... if there's
any areas that don't jell, let's talk about it,'' Rafalat said.
   One of the problems has been the lack of a manual dishwashing
system.
   ``We're being told we have to have five-compartment sinks,'' he
said. ``Well, we're saying, `Sorry chaps, we use dishwashers,
actually, in today's world.' I mean, a dishwasher does the job
better, probably. But that isn't taken into account in the Soviet
regulations.''
   Rafalat said kitchen plans were submitted to city officials
months ago, and ``we assumed that those had been looked at,
approved, but in reality, no one told us that they hadn't.''
   Tass, citing fears of salmonella poisoning that occurred in
Moscow a year ago, said unwashed vegetables were found next to
prepared foods, in violation of standards.
   ``Those are things that, once we know about, we'll do to comply
with the Soviet law, although we don't do it that way in any other
country,'' Rafalat said. ``We have open kitchens because, again,
our philosophy is that you have an open planned work area, our
employees are trained in hygiene, and they handle it accordingly.''
   Once Pizza Hut officials were able to explain their operations
to the inspectors, they were allowed to reopen the Kutuzovsky
Prospekt restaurant, he said.
   ``Nothing has changed at all since last Thursday. We're running
exactly the same restaurant, but we now have a clean bill of health
and we have an agreement to work jointly with the authorities to
explain our technologies and the way we do things, which really
should have happened a lot earlier,'' he said.
   Rafalat could not say when the Gorky Street restaurant would
reopen, adding that workers there had to throw out about 220 pounds
of dough Wednesday. ``It's a pretty substantial amount of food in a
city which I don't think should be wasting food,'' he said.
   The larger restaurant has been serving around 2,000 customers a
day, and many want two or three pizzas, forcing officials to
restrict the number of pies a person can take out, he said.
   Rafalat said his objective was to ``find a common language''
with city officials, ``because that's the future of this country
here. If they don't find a common language, then there's not going
to be many more businesses opening up.''
   ``Soviet bureaucracy is renowned for its ability to try and
strangle businesses,'' he said.
   But he noted PepsiCo has 16 years of dealing with the Soviet
bureaucracy - ``long enough to know that it's a factor of business
life here, and we're going to keep punching our way through.''

<HEAD>Study: U.S. Doctors' Fees Twice as High as Canadians'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An economist delving into why Americans pay more
than Canadians for health care has discovered one important reason:
U.S. doctors charge twice as much for doing less.
   Despite their bigger fees, U.S. doctors earn only about
one-third more than their Canadian counterparts, said the study.
This is largely because they see fewer patients and have higher
overhead for such things as fancier offices.
   Health care for Americans costs an average of $1,780 per year,
while for Canadians it costs $1,286, according to the study by
economist Victor R. Fuchs of Stanford University.
   Overall, physician fees are 2.4 times higher in the United
States, he said. Differences in hospital bills and other expenses
also contribute to the lower cost of medical care in Canada.
   However, Canadian doctors do not save money by skimping on
patient care, Fuchs said. In fact, he found that they provide about
25 percent more services to their patients.
   Canada provides complete, fully paid health coverage for all
citizens. In the United States, one in seven people has no health
insurance, and even those with coverage typically have to pay at
least part of the bill.
   ``If physician fees in the United States were the same as in
Canada, by how much would total health care expenditures be
reduced?'' said Fuchs. ``If the fees were cut in half and lowered
to the Canadian level, total expenditures would be reduced by about
10 percent.''
   His calculations, which converted Canadian figures into U.S.
dollars, were based was based on 1985 data and published in today's
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Among the findings:
   -U.S. fees for surgery and other high-tech services, such as
X-rays and anesthesia, were more than three times higher.
   -On a per capita basis, Canada had more doctors but fewer
specialists.
   -In 1985, net income for office-based doctors was $112,199 in
the United States and $73,607 in Canada.
   -U.S. doctors are paid five times more than Canadians for
visiting patients in the hospital.
   Canadian fees are uniform for each service within provinces and
are set through negotiations between doctors and the government.
   Fuchs said he doubts the Canadian system could be adopted in the
United States.
   ``There is reason to question whether the quality of our civil
services is up to the quality of the Canadian civil services,'' he
said. ``There is also reason to question whether the organization
and degree of discipline in the profession is as strong as in
Canada. We are very much individualists, and that includes
physicians.''

possible language problems with international operators.
   Beginning Oct. 3, callers are to dial 1-800-100 to get an AT&amp;T

States.
   During an introductory period, AT&amp;T will allow U.S. military

   Proposals to require food manufacturers to
disclose the nutrition content of their products should be extended
to restaurants, says a committee of experts.
   The Institute of Medicine panel also said Wednesday that
nutrition labeling should be required for fresh and frozen meat and
poultry, as well as prepared products.
   Food-labeling proposals on Capitol Hill and by the Food and Drug
Administration already include many of the provisions the panel
recommended for packaged food, seafood and produce.
   But neither the pending legislation nor the draft regulations
addresses meat, poultry or restaurants.
   The institute is an affiliate of the National Academy of
Sciences, the congressionally chartered private body established to
provide scientific advice to government agencies.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency planned to consider
nutrition-content disclosure for restaurants some time in the
future, but ``grocery stores are our higher priority.''
   The FDA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services,
last July proposed regulations that would require nutrition
labeling for nearly all packaged foods and fresh produce and
seafood.

<HEAD>Sessions Defends FBI Stings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   FBI Director William S. Sessions is defending
the bureau's undercover tactics, including the sting operation
which videotaped Washington Mayor Marion Barry smoking crack
cocaine.
   But Sessions acknowledged Wednesday that a jury's refusal to
convict Barry of the charge arising from that sting may have
underscored the ``need to be very careful and look very carefully
before you elect to use a particular technique.''
   Sessions also backed the FBI's use of undercover operations to
catch people in the act of other misdeeds, as in the Abscam
corruption investigation of a decade ago.
   ``When we gather evidence, it is not always simply a matter of
walking up and asking the farmer if his eggs are fresh,'' Sessions
said.
   The videotapes of Barry smoking crack ``were not suppressed
under the law, they were allowed by the court, they were available
to the jury and it did what it wanted to do with it, which is the
genius of our system,'' Sessions said.
   On other subjects, the director said the FBI had no indication
of Iraqi-sponsored terrorism since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last
month.

   A fourth state lawmaker pleaded guilty
in an FBI vote-selling sting and faces up to 20 years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   Rep. Robert Kohn, one of 10 lawmakers indicted in the Statehouse
corruption probe, resigned his seat Wednesday and pleaded guilty to
conspiracy hours later in a plea bargain.
   He is cooperating with investigators and disclosed last month he
had been working undercover for several months to snare other
lawmakers in the FBI's Operation Lost Trust.
   Kohn, 45, a Republican from Charleston, admitted he offered to
push a horse- and dog-racing bill and ask others to do so in return
for $10,000. A move to bring up the bill failed in the House this
year.
   At a hearing Wednesday, prosecutors showed a videotape of Kohn
pocketing $2,500 on a yacht off Hilton Head Island last April 14.
Kohn is seen sitting at a table with a drink when a wad of money is
slid across the table.
   Kohn admitted the money came from lobbyist Ron Cobb, though Cobb
is not seen in the picture. Cobb was working undercover for the
FBI.
   FBI agent Mike Clemens said Kohn accepted $2,500 from Cobb on
Jan. 16 and another $2,500 on the yacht.
   Kohn, a state representative since 1975, wouldn't comment after
the hearing, citing a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge
Falcon Hawkins.
   No sentencing date was set.

<HEAD>Hazardous Waste Cleanup Crew Arrested in Incineration Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of a plan to burn
dioxin-tainted waste at a closed herbicide plant had five cleanup
workers arrested for testing an incinerator.
   The employees of Vertac Site Contractors, a cleanup company,
were arrested Wednesday on misdemeanor charges of violating a city
ordinance regarding incineration, Police Chief Frank Neely said.
   The company has a state contract to dispose of nearly 30,000
barrels of hazardous waste at the plant, where herbicides,
including the Vietnam-era Agent Orange, were made for decades. Much
of the waste is contaminated with dioxin, a chemical believed to
cause cancer and a range of other ailments.
   The plant, last owned by Vertac Chemical Corp., is high on the
federal government's priority Superfund list for cleanup of
hazardous waste sites.
   The company on Wednesday burned waste not containing dioxin in
order to determine whether an incinerator can meet standards
required for disposal of dioxin.
   ``The people opposed to the burn were able to obtain an
affidavit for arrest for burning solid waste in the city,'' Neely
said.
   City ordinances allow the burning of dioxin-tainted waste only;
all other incineration is illegal, authorities said.
   The five workers arrested were released on their own
recognizance, he said.
   Mayor Tommy Swaim, an incinerator supporter, criticized
Municipal Judge Robert Batton for acting on the arrest request from
two opponents, who contend that burning the waste is dangerous.
   ``This is a ridiculous arrest, totally ridiculous,'' Swaim said.
``The judge is totally out of line.''
   Laura Nelson, a spokeswoman for the cleanup company, said test
burning will be halted while ``we take the matter under legal
advisement and some decision is made.''
   Michael Smith, a lawyer for the workers, also criticized the
arrests. ``What they've done is sworn out warrants against innocent
people just doing their jobs,'' he said.

   Pierre Rinfret's dark-horse
gubernatorial campaign took another strange turn when he sat out a
unity meeting with Republican leaders, demanding to be declared
``the undisputed head of our party.''
   Rinfret, who is challenging Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo but has
been fighting with his own party, had agreed to attend Wednesday's
meeting of Westchester County GOP leaders but instead sent a
spokesman with a resolution he wanted passed immediately.
   It urged Republicans to endorse his plan to freeze state
spending, cut taxes and reduce state government.
   Rinfret also demanded that county party leaders ``recognize
Pierre Rinfret as the undisputed head of our party and designate
his race for governor as being of equal opportunity with any and
all other races in the state.''
   State party chairman J. Patrick Barrett said no action was taken
on Rinfret's resolution because the meeting was informal.
   ``We had a lively discussion on how to elect our Republican
state ticket,'' Barrett said. ``We strongly reaffirm our support
for Pierre Rinfret for governor.''
   In the four months since desparate GOP officials recruited him
to challenge Cuomo's bid for a third fourth-year term, Rinfret has
garnered attention with proposals like arming and training 100,000
vigilantes to fight crime in New York City, and selling the city
subway system.
   Rinfret, 66, an economist and former unpaid adviser to President
Nixon, also invited a TV reporter to his inauguration - and
suggested her husband stay home. And the academic creditials in his
campaign biography have been questioned.
   Last week, Rinfret threatened to drop out of the race and lashed
out at his party's leaders, accusing them of hoarding a $3.25
million campaign war chest for their own benefit. He later dropped
the threat.
   Republican state Sen. Roy Goodman said Wednesday's meeting was
called to ``talk about the unity of this party.''
   As the meeting got under way, a Rinfret aide handed out copies
of a letter Rinfret sent to Barrett and GOP county chairmen.
Rinfret said events in the last 24 hours ``have made my attendance
a political impossibility.''
   ``The legislative leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate
have tried to buy me off with a handful of money,'' he wrote.
``Yesterday, I was offered a grand total of $40,000 to shut up, go
away, and run a dismal campaign for governor.''
   Nassau County GOP chairman Joseph Mondello said he had offered
Rinfret $25,000 to help the campaign. Kavanau wouldn't say who
offered the additional $15,000.
   An aide said Rinfret was unavailable for comment.

   A gunman who holed up in a McDonald's in

a bathroom, lay on the floor with 20 others inside and threatened
no one, authorities says.
   Prosecutors said Wednesday they won't press for hostage-taking

   ``There was no crime, period, inside McDonald's,'' said Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
   Police had assumed the worst Monday when a gunman fled into the
fast-food restaurant moments after a robbery of about $200 at a
clothing store nearby.
   Police originally alleged Girard held McDonald's customers and
employees hostage for nearly seven hours. The wait ended early
Tuesday when officers lobbed ``flash-bang'' grenades inside and
wrestled Girard to the ground.
   But on Wednesday, Gary Hearnsberger, a deputy district attorney,
said, ``It does not appear that from any of the statements that he
ever threatened anybody or said, `You can't leave.' ''
   ``He was kind of going along with the program,'' Hearnsberger
said. ``He laid on the floor with the other people.''
   Girard pleaded innocent Wednesday to armed robbery and weapons
charges stemming from the clothing store robbery and a holdup of a
flower shop Sept. 8.
   Police Lt. Ron Ingels said that a few people ran from the
restaurant but most ducked under tables or fled to a basement after
a cashier noticed the .38-caliber revolver in Girard's waistband
and shouted a warning.
   ``He didn't wave the gun and order them to stay there,'' Ingels
said. ``I suppose they thought that if they got up and walked out,
something bad could happen.''
   Knowing that Girard was inside and armed, arriving officers
assumed they were dealing with a hostage situation, Ingels said.
   ``We arrive and we don't know what caused them to lay on the
floor. We don't know if the guy ordered them to lay on the floor or
what,'' Ingels said.

   The NFL commissioner has summoned a New England
Patriots player to his office to answer allegations he exposed
himself and made a lewd suggestion to a woman sportswriter for the
Boston Herald in the locker room.
   Meanwhile, the newspaper and national women's groups are
demanding action against Patriots owner Victor Kiam and the player,
Zeke Mowatt.
   Kiam, who also owns the company that makes Remington shavers,
has been criticized for not condemning Mowatt. He was also quoted
in news reports as referring to the Herald reporter, Lisa Olson, as
``a classic bitch.''
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue may decide to suspend, fine or
reprimand Mowatt next week after he hears the player's side of the
story, league spokesman Joe Browne said Wednesday.
   Olson has said that several members of the football team
approached her naked in the locker room Sept. 17 and made lewd
suggestions. The Herald reported five players were involved. Mowatt
was said to be among them.
   The team said earlier this week that it had fined a player for
harassing Olson. The player was not identified, and the amount of
the fine was not disclosed.
   Meanwhile, the Herald ran an editorial Wednesday asking fans to
stay away from Sunday's Patriots game, and sports editor Bob Sales
said he sent a letter to Tagliabue calling for Kiam's suspension.
   Michele Himmelberg, president of the Association for Women in
Sports Media, said her group would demand that Tagliabue make an
example of Kiam to prevent ``unjust harassment'' from hindering
women reporters in their work.
   The Boston chapter of the National Organization for Women is
considering a boycott of Remington products.
   Kiam denied the comment attributed to him, saying he called
Olson ``agressive'' only. He apologized for any mistreatment by his
employees, but Olson refused to accept.
   ``How can I accept his apology after he questioned my
professionalism in front of hundreds of thousands of television
viewers?'' Olson said. ``It's obvious the Patriots are trying to
bury the sexual harassment issue by trying to discredit me with
blatant lies.''
   She said the Patriots should name the players she said verbally
and sexually harassed her, force them to undergo counseling, slap
them with substantial fines and give the proceeds to a shelter for
battered women.
   ``I was humiliated,'' she said. ``I was put through something so
vile like that only because I am a woman.''
   After the incident, Kiam was quoted as saying the Herald had
been ``asking for trouble'' in sending a woman reporter into the
locker room. Many newspapers have women sportswriters who regularly
enter men's locker rooms for interviews.

<TEXT>
   Theater owners and filmmakers are giving the
new movie rating NC-17 mixed reviews, saying it offers improvements
over the ruinous X rating but still may prove troublesome.
   The Motion Picture Association of America eliminated the X
rating on Wednesday, replacing it with NC-17, for no children under
17 admitted.
   It said the new label does not immediately carry the commercial
stigma of X, which is so strong that many theater chains -
including the nation's two largest - won't show X-rated films and
many newspapers won't carry ads for them.
   The MPAA also said it will give film companies and theater
owners more details on films it rates R, noting violence, sex and
language. The PG-13, PG and G ratings will remain the same.
   Universal Pictures' X-rated ``Henry &amp; June,'' a historical drama
featuring some sex scenes, will be the first film bearing the NC-17
rating, Universal said.
   ``It's a great step,'' said Philip Kaufman, director of ``Henry
&amp; June.'' ``I'm just really delighted that we can show this film
uncut in America and show the film the way I made it. It is not
intended as a prurient film.''
   Critics of the MPAA had been trying for months to change the
system. They said the X rating, never copyrighted, had become
synonymous with pornography because makers of hard-core adult films
used it freely.
   The new rating will be copyrighted. That means it cannot be used
by porno producers unless they submit their films for MPAA review,
something they never do because it costs up to $2,000 per film.
   Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, hosts of a syndicated
movie-preview show, applauded the new category.
   ``It represents a victory for everyone who cares about truly
adult films. I'm using adult here in the sense of mature,
thoughtful, serious and intelligent - not in the sense of `dirty
movies,' '' Ebert said.
   ``It's good news,'' said Dan Harkins, president of the
23-theater Harkins Theatres chain in Phoenix. ``It takes some of
the politics out of the rating system and our advertising will be
strengthened.''
   It was unclear whether newspapers and TV and radio stations
would be more inclined to carry ads for movies bearing the NC-17
mark.
   Laura Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times, predicted
advertisements would be judged on a combination of their artwork
and critics' opinions on the movies' artistic worth.
   Bert Manzari, president of the 28-screen Seven Gables chain in
Seattle, said such an evaluation system could become unworkable.
``It's really going to cause a dilemma for the papers,'' Manzari
said.
   William Kartozian, president of the National Organization of
Theater Owners, agreed that advertising NC-17 titles could be
difficult.
   ``I hope the media will perceive that there's a difference
between these films and skin flicks,'' said Kartozian, whose
organization represents the owners of 13,000 theater screens.
   Kartozian said the initial response to the new rating had been
positive, and he expected most theaters to show NC-17 films. He
also said some states may amend the NC-17 rating to NC-18, barring
children under 18.
   The last time the ratings were changed was in 1984, when the
PG-13 rating was added between the PG and R ratings. That change
was prompted by ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''
   X-rated films have included ``Midnight Cowboy'' in 1969, ``Last
Tango in Paris'' in 1973 and ``A Clockwork Orange'' in 1971.
   MPAA President Jack Valenti said the rating system had been
justifiably criticized. ``It's no one's fault, but the X rating has
a patina, a complexion which frankly we never intended it to
have,'' he said.
   NC-17 was especially welcome at Miramax Films, which had several
recent releases rated X.
   Miramax sued the MPAA over its X rating for ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!'' The company lost, but a New York Supreme Court judge warned
that the rating system bordered on censorship.
   ``This just goes to show that being tenacious without waving the
flag can get the job done,'' said Harvey Weinstein, Miramax
co-chairman.

<HEAD>State Agents Peddle Sex Aids, Steamy Movies to Collect Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State agents were porn peddlers for a
day, selling sex aids, steamy movies and spicy novelties to pay off
the taxes of a once-bustling topless coffee shop.
   About 100 people showed up Wednesday for the sale at Debbie Duz
Donuts. A back room reserved for those over 21 was filled with
movies, magazines, aids and ointments. Milder items included
novelty lighters, key chains and coffee mugs.
   ``I sure am glad I didn't have my glasses on or they would have
been all fogged up,'' said Warren Williams. ``Sunglasses probably
would have cracked right there on my face.''
   Williams, 68, and others at the sale said they wanted to get a
first look at the place before it faded into Fort Collins history.
``I didn't make it while they were in business, so I thought I'd
see them go out of business,'' he said.
   The property was seized April 4 and former part-owner Dennis
Cortese was charged with selling methamphetamines and cocaine in an
undercover investigation by the Sheriff's Department.
   Cortese said he gave up the fight to save the business because
he is broke.
   The state held the auction to cover about $7,500 owed in state
taxes. The auction raised about $10,800, said Dorothy Dalquist, a
Revenue Department spokeswoman.
   The difference will cover auction costs and local taxes owed,
with anything left over going to creditors.

<HEAD>Final Mohawk Standoff Ends In Clash, Sparking Second Battle</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY19</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-week standoff over Mohawk tribal lands
and sovereignty ended in a brawl as warriors lay down their weapons
and left a detoxification center but resisted when soldiers tried
to arrest them.
   About 400 Mohawks who live on a nearby reservation watched
Wednesday night's clash on television, grabbed baseball bats, lead
pipes and rocks and attacked troops guarding a bridge that links
their community with Montreal.
   A soldier suffered facial injuries in Mercier Bridge incident,
which ended after soldiers trained rifles on the protesters,
threatening to shoot.
   Only minor injuries were reported in the earlier brawl at Oka,
which began after some of the more than 50 militants who had been
holed up for a month at the drug and alcohol treatment center tried
to push past troops.
   The warriors at the Indian settlement 18 miles west of Montreal
had agreed to end the standoff peacefully but after leaving the
center many tried to evade soldiers and pass through barbed-wire
barricades.
   Brawls broke out when soldiers - some with fixed bayonets -
seized warriors and women and children accompanying them. Some
Mohawks had small children in their arms and were knocked to the
ground, witnesses said.
   Police arrested six Mohawks outside army lines on unspecified
charges and a seventh for obstructing officers. Three Warriors were
arrested and placed in provincial police custody.
   At least 50 Mohawks were in army custody late Wednesday and some
could face charges later in connection with a prolonged power
struggle that amounted to a series of sporadic clashes.
   The standoff began July 11 when police tried to storm an Indian
barricade outside Oka and a Quebec provincial police officer was
killed. Blame has not been fixed in the officer's death.
   The barricade, put up by Indians opposed to the planned
extension of a golf course onto what they claim as tribal land, was
dismantled by troops last month. That's when the warriors retreated
to the treatment center.
   Dozens of Indians, troops and police have been injured in the
dispute, which has gripped the Canadian nation with its questions
of how far the government should go in guaranteeing native rights
and sovereignty.
   No arrests were reported at the Mercier Bridge, which Indians
had blockaded for most of the summer in support of their Oka
brethren.
   Maj. Alain Tremblay said it was possible a few of the Oka
warriors had escaped into the woods surrounding the treatment
center. He said a search was planned for sometime today.
   At the Mercier Bridge, soldiers were ordered to take aim at the
angry Indians from the Kahnawake reservation who were showering
them with rocks.
   ``It was the first time (in the Mohawk crisis) we had to give
the order to point weapons,'' said army Lt. Col. Greg Mitchell.
``Thank God it had the effect of getting the people to withdraw. ''
   The checkpoint was set up to ensure that the bridge - a major
commutation route for people who work in Montreal and live on the
St. Lawrence River's southern bank - remains open.
   After the confrontation ended, the Mohawks milled about,
watching coverage of the end to the standoff at Oka on a portable
black-and-white television set. Jeers erupted when a television
announcer said the standoff with Mohawks had cost the Quebec
government $180 million.
   ``It's only a fraction of what they owe us,'' said one Mohawk
man.
   The Oka confrontation had mobilized the support of native
communities across the country, said an Indian spokesman.
   ``There is no question that we have won,'' said Francis Boots, a
spokesman for the Warrior Society from the Akwesasne reservation,
south of Cornwall, Ontario.
   ``We have acquired an awareness among Canadian public. We can
now talk without bureaucrats sweeping issues like land rights under
the rug,'' he said.
   The decision to leave the center near Oka was made earlier
Wednesday. Chief negotiator Terry Doxtator had said it was made
because of fear the army would withdraw and be replaced by Quebec
provincial police.
   Some of the Indians were concerned about what treatment they
would receive by a force that had lost a member in the initial
clash in July.
   U.S. lawyer Stanley Cohen, who walked out of the treatment
center Monday night, was released on $3,000 bail Wednesday.
   Cohen, 40, pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of participating
in a riot, obstructing justice, and possession of a firearm in
manner dangerous to public security. He has been advising the
Mohawks since the crisis began.

   The dollar was mostly lower in early European
trading today. Gold prices also fell as traders concentrated on oil
price movements.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said attention focused on the Persian Gulf
crisis and President Bush's announcement that he is likely to
authorize the sale of crude oil from U.S. strategic reserves to
moderate oil prices.
   The move softened oil prices and gold moved down too.
   ``Oil and rumors are moving this market,'' said a London trader.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.10 yen to close at 137.50 yen.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.90 yen.

   Today's forecast said a band of showers and thunderstorms was
expected to extend from Illinois to Colorado. Showers also were
likely in central California.
   Sunny skies were forecast over a large area from the southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley, and temperatures were expected to rise
as much as 16 degrees above normal.
   Cool air was expected to filter into the northern Plains,
bringing seasonable highs in the 60s and 70s. On Wednesday,
temperatures in the mid-90s broke highs for the date in parts of
Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota.
   In contrast, temperatures dipped into the 40s Wednesday in parts
of the Southeast.
   Small hail fell near Fort Washakie, Wyo., and Loveland, Colo.
   The high temperature for the nation Wednesday was 103 degrees at

<HEAD>Iraq Gives Kuwaitis One Month to Change Citizenship</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today gave Kuwaitis a month to become
Iraqi citizens, a new measure aimed at further breaking down
Kuwait's national identity and making the country part of Iraq.
   A new law published by the Interior Ministry said citizens of
Kuwait - which Iraq proclaimed its 19th province after seizing the
oil-rich emirate eight weeks ago - have until Oct. 31 to adopt
Iraqi citizenship.
   The ministry did not say what would happen to Kuwaitis still in
the occupied kingdom who do not change their citizenship by the
deadline.
   The law stipulated that only Kuwaitis born in Kuwait of Kuwaiti
mothers and fathers are eligible for Iraqi citizenship.
   According to ministry statistics, the 1988 census numbered
so-called pure Kuwaitis at 270,000 out of a total population of
about 500,000 citizens.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreigners also live in Kuwait. They
include an estimated 300,000 Palestinians, the largest foreign
community still in Kuwait. There are also about 120,000 Indians,
many of whom are trying to leave. Scores of thousands of Asians
have already fled.
   Baghdad's Interior Ministry said Kuwaitis abroad can get Iraqi
nationality cards from Iraqi embassies - on condition they return
their Kuwaiti nationality documents.
   Baghdad also stepped up its verbal attack on the Soviet Union
today in response to statements made by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze at the United Nations earlier in the week.
   The Al-Thawra daily, the paper of the ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party, accused the Soviets of conducting a ``policy of
appeasement'' towards the United States.
   The newspaper said in an editorial that the Soviet Union,
``which has lost its power and influence in the world,'' had
succumbed to bribery from the West and gulf Arab countries to help
its own troubled economy.
   There was a similar attack by the official Iraqi News Agency on
Wednesday.

   Richard Clay Bodine, a state legislator
for 16 years who was the Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor in 1972, died Wednesday of a heart attack at St. Joseph's
Hospital. He was 62.
   Bodine was admitted to the hospital with a heart ailment a week
earlier.
   Bodine, an attorney, was first elected to the Indiana House in
1963, and quickly established himself as a Democratic leader. He
was elected House speaker in 1965 after he was elected to a second
term.
   Instead of seeking re-election in 1968, Bodine made a bid for
the Democratic nomination for governor and lost to then-Lt. Gov.
Robert Rock.
   Bodine returned to the Legislature in 1971 and ran for
lieutenant governor on the Democratic ticket in 1972 as a
running-mate to former Gov. Matthew Welsh. They were defeated by
the Republican duo of Otis Bowen and Robert D. Orr.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Note to Embassies Was Misinterpreted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi officials said today that a note
asking embassies in Baghdad for a list of non-diplomats living in
their compounds had been misinterpreted as a death threat.
   The Foreign Ministry refused official comment on the note, which
was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker on Wednesday
as a threat to hang diplomats harboring foreigners.
   However, officials did say that the ministry had distributed a
memo to the embassies informing them that they should submit a list
of nationals who are not diplomats but who are either in embassies,
diplomatic premises or houses of diplomats.
   The memo contained a reminder of an Iraqi law, issued when Iraq
annexed Kuwait last month, which stipulated that those who provide
refuge for foreigners could be punished by death.
   The officials said the memo was misinterpreted in that it was
not a threat against foreign diplomats, but was just pointing out
what the law was as it applied to Iraqis.
   On Wednesday, Baker said the note ``falls under the heading of
the principle of the three R's, I think. We've read it, it's
repugnant and we reject it.''
   Today, the French Foreign Ministry also said its embassy had
also received the note. A spokesman termed it ``utterly
intolerable'' and said France was consulting with ``friendly
countries'' about the matter.
   Britain's Foreign Office said today that its diplomats had
received ``a note'' but declined to characterize it immediately as
a death threat.
   Iraq's Ambassador to Washington, Mohamed al-Mashat, denied
Wednesday night that any such threats has been made by Iraqi
officials.
   ``We're not threatening anyone,'' al-Mashat told reporters after
a meeting a the State Department. He refused further comment.

   Covenant House founder, the Rev. Bruce Ritter,
has been cleared of criminal charges, according to a published
report today.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams is concluding a nine-month
investigation of charges of sexual and financial misconduct,
including an allegation that Ritter spent more than $20,000 on a
male ex-prostitute.
   Tim Gilles, a spokesman for the attorney general, told the New
York Post in today's editions: ``There are some questionable
financial transactions. But we did not find anything that would
constitute theft or larceny or criminal conduct.''
   Edward Barbini, another Abrams spokesman, said Abrams has
pressed for reforms to ensure the shelter's stability ``while also
protecting the interest of people who donate money to Covenant
House.''
   Robert McGrath, a shelter spokesman, told the Post that 25 of
the 30 reforms suggested by Abrams have already been carried out.
   A remaining issue is Abrams' demand that the shelter make
periodic financial reports to the state, the Post said.

   Stomping cockroaches is fine with Randy Robertson,
but he won $500 by finding another use for them.
   He won the ``most creative cockroach'' at the International
Roach Finals on Wednesday by dressing up a trio as beach bums,
complete with trendy sun glasses and a sailboard.
   ``They're Florida roaches, so I figured they'd be comfortable in
that setting,'' explained Robertson, a free-lance artist from North
Port on Florida's west coast.
   There was also ``Elvis Roachly,'' as in ``the King'' of roaches,
wearing a white-sequined suit with a tiny guitar. And jolly old
Santa Roach, clad in a red felt suit and perched on the roof of a
toy house.
   The contest, sponsored by a pesticide company, also searched for
the largest roach - a 1.88-inch colossus Palmetto bug from Okinawa,
Japan.
   Although it was the same size as last year's winner, it was the
first time a foreign roach was crowned world's largest in the
international contest, beating out more than 1,000 entries.

   Police opened fire today to quell
anti-government riots, killing three people and wounding 16 who
were protesting federal job quotas for low-caste Hindus, said
doctors and news reports.
   Police clashed with students in at least three neighborhoods
when protesters blocked roads and railway tracks with metal drums
and tree branches.
   It was the third straight day of violence in the capital. Prime
Minister V.P. Singh had appealed to the youths Wednesday to give up
violence and start talks, but the students rejected his offer.
   Singh, in a nationally broadcast speech Wednesday, said he would
rather resign than give up a cause that ``I believe in so
intensely.''
   Today's deaths raised to 38 the number killed in street battles
with police or by suicide since Singh announced the affirmative
action program Aug. 7.
   United News of India said two people were killed and 13 injured
in police gunfire today in Bawli, 35 miles northeast of New Delhi.
It did not give details.
   Press Trust of India said police opened fired when a mob set
ablaze some vehicles and hurled stones and bricks at police patrols
in eastern New Delhi's Shakarpur neighborhood.
   Doctors at the Jai Prakash Naraian Hospital said a 33-year-old
man died of bullet wounds to the head and chest. Three were
wounded, including one suffering critical chest and abdomen wounds.
   A doctor who declined to give his name said the other two
victims were ``under control.''
   About 20 students have attempted self-immolation across northern
India to protest the quotas, which reserve nearly half of the
government's 18 million jobs for lower castes.
   Press Trust of India said a 13-year-old student, Sachin Kumar,
consumed a fatal dose of poison Wednesday in Hapur outside New
Delhi, blaming Singh's policy for his action.
   Today one person died of bullet wounds sustained in police
firing Wednesday in Modinagar, 55 miles west of New Delhi. Four
people were killed in the firing Wednesday.
   Singh says the quotas will promote social justice by doing away
with inequities imposed by the rigid caste system. Because of their
low birth, the lower castes are generally poor and less educated.
   The policy's opponents say the move is aimed at garnering votes
from the lower castes, who form a majority of Indian voters.
   The protesters maintain that many of the low-castes are no
longer underprivileged and do not need affirmative action programs.
   The latest deaths raise to 36 the number of people killed in
suicides and street battles with police since Singh announced the
affirmative action program.
   Student groups have gone on the rampage in several northern
Indian towns, torching government vehicles, banks and offices.
   Middle-class housewives and shopkeepers have supported the
protesters, sheltering them from police and sometimes hurling
stones at policemen.

<TEXT>
   A housing firm violated a new law by
refusing to rent apartments to a drug treatment program, a federal
jury has decided.
   The decision Wednesday against Southern Management Corp. of
Silver Spring, Md., was the first court test of a fair housing law
barring discrimination against handicapped individuals, officials
said.
   Since the law went into effect in March 1989, the Justice
Department has defined ``handicapped'' to include recovering
substance abusers, an interpretation upheld by U.S. District Judge
Albert V. Bryan Jr.
   After a two-day trial before Bryan, a jury on Wednesday ordered
Southern Management to pay $36,280 in damages to the Fairfax-Falls
Church Community Services Board, a Northern Virginia public agency
that runs a drug rehabilitation program. A Southern Management
official last year had refused to rent three apartments to
Crossroads, telling program officers, ``I'm not discriminating
against you; I won't rent to any drug program,'' according to
testimony.
   Neighborhood opposition has emerged in recent years as one of
the biggest barriers to expanding drug treatment, one of the prime
goals of the Bush administration's anti-drug strategy. Over the
past year, the Justice Department has attempted to use the 1988 law
to help break down those barriers, officials said.
   ``This is significant to fair housing enforcement; it's the
first time a case like this was ever presented to a jury,'' said
Paul Hancock, chief of housing and civil enforcement of the Justice
Department's civil rights division.
   A lawyer for Southern Management said the firm probably will
appeal the verdict.
   Crossroads is a long-term rehabilitation program that treats
about 40 serious drug and alcohol abusers at its residential
facility, said Tim Harmon, a director of the Fairfax-Falls Church
services board who oversees the program. After graduating from the
residential facility, patients are placed in apartments while they
work in the community and continue their recovery under
supervision.

   A 13-year-old boy was fatally shot in the chest
today, the second child to die in gunfire since Sunday. Nine
children have been gunned down in New York City this week,
including four teen-agers in one day.
   The latest victim, Levy Mitchell, was shot once in the chest in
the the Bronx, said Sgt. Grace Ridley, a police spokeswoman. He was
dead on arrival at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital after being shot at 2:45
a.m. while he was visiting friends, Ridley said. There were no
suspects, and no weapon was recovered.
   At about the same time, a 15-year-old boy was arrested and
charged with the shooting of a 13-year-old girl Wednesday evening,
Ridley said.
   The boy, Richard Burke, was charged with secon-degree assault
and criminal possession of a weapon, she said. The victim, whose
name was withheld, was with friends when she was shot in the back
and hand, Ridley said.
   She was hospitalized in stable cndition, Ridley said.
   To combat the escalating crime, Mayor David Dinkins plans to get
7,500 more police officers on the street and to expand the rest of
the criminal justice system, a newspaper reported today.
   But it was unclear how Dinkins would pay for the new programs,
the New York Daily News said.
   The News quoted unidentified Dinkins aides and police officials
saying the plan would hire just under 5,000 more officers and more
than 3,000 new civilian police employees, who would free deskbound
officers for street duty.
   Four teen-agers were wounded by gunfire Tuesday in the city
during a five-hour period.
   On Monday, a 13-year-old girl was shot in the head with pellets
as she and a girlfriend sat on a bench in Brooklyn. She was listed
in stable condition.
   A 15-year-old girl was also shot in the thigh Monday as she was
walking with her boyfriend in Brooklyn.
   On Sunday, 12-year-old Laykama Taylor was shot to death outside
a Brooklyn housing project. The girl, whose nickname was ``Sugar,''
spent her last days in fear of retaliation after winning a street
fight, neighbors told police. She was the sixth child shooting
victim to die since July 22.

   An angry mob coming to the aid of a woman mugged
on a subway in the Bronx chased the robbery suspect onto train
tracks, where police say the man fell against the 600-volt third
rail and was electrocuted.
   ``Sometimes it's difficult to feel sad about these things,''
said Transit Police spokesman Al O'Leary. ``Maybe there is a higher
state of justice.''
   The incident began at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, when, according to
police, 22-year-old Jean Carlos Pabain Perez walked up to a woman,
stuck a knife in her face and demanded money. The woman handed over
her purse, then Perez used the knife to cut off her watch, police
said.
   The man then jumped out of the train and the woman ran after
him, screaming for help, police said.
   Six men who saw the incident chased Perez into the street. They
caught and tried to detain him. But he broke loose, ran down the
block and leaped into the nearby Westchester train yard to hide,
police said.
   About 40 minutes later, the transit authority's police found
Perez dead on the third rail.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu unveiled a plan today
to dispatch Japanese military personnel overseas for the first time
since World War II, but he said they would be unarmed and kept away
from combat.
   The proposal, which must be approved by the Parliament, calls
for the establishment of the U.N. Peace Cooperation Corps - a group
of military and civilian personnel to participate in U.N.
peace-keeping activities.
   Kaifu acknowledged criticism that Japan is supplying little more
than money to the U.S.-led force deployed in the Middle East in
response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Kaifu flies Friday to the
United States, where some of the harshest criticism has been
voiced.
   ``I myself thought we had to do something requiring a little
sweat,'' Kaifu told a televised news conference.
   The Japanese proposal is likely to arouse fears among Asian
countries about renewed militarism in Japan. The Asian countries
suffered from Japanese aggression before and during World War II.
   The opposition Japan Socialist Party, citing the country's
no-war constitution, expressed opposition to the plan in a meeting
with Kaifu earlier today, Cabinet spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said.
   That could mean difficulty in winning approval for the plan in
Parliament because the governing Liberal Democratic Party does not
have a majority in the upper house. The legislation may not be
voted on until mid-November.
   Kaifu described the proposal, which has yet to be formally
drafted, as part of Japan's effort to define its role in the
post-Cold War era.
   Under the proposal, the corps would be under the prime
minister's office and would not be allowed to use force. Activities
could include communications, medical support and transportation of
goods and personnel, sources have said.
   Kaifu did not give a size for the corps, although sources have
said it could include 1,000 to 2,000 people.
   Although there has been debate within the government about
whether the corps' members could carry pistols, Kaifu said they
would be unarmed.
   ``I know there are many opinions about their role, but my
position is I don't want them to go to places where they have to
have weapons,'' he said.
   But Nobutoshi Akao, director-general of the United Nations
Bureau in the Foreign Ministry, refused to rule out the possibility
members of the corps would carry sidearms under certain
circumstances.
   Masashi Nishihara, a professor of international relations at the
National Defense Academy, said: ``I'm not sure it's going to be a
big contribution'' to the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf.
   Kaifu, when asked why Japan was not willing to play a military
role, responded: ``I agree that Japan should do more than just make
comments about the situation, but I cannot accept the criticism
Japan is not doing enough just because it is not taking military
measures.''
   Japan's postwar constitution, which was written by U.S.
officials, prohibits the use of force to settle international
disputes.
   Before Kaifu's announcement, the government pledged $4 billion
in assistance to the U.S.-led multinational force and Middle East
nations having economic troubles because of the international
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   Japan last month also pledged to send about 100 civilian medical
personnel to the Middle East.

   Two assailants broke into the home of
an Air Force general assigned to NATO and overpowered a U.S. guard,
but the general was outside the country at the time, the U.S.
Embassy said today.
   The Belgian television station VTM, quoting an unidentified
source, described the incident Tuesday night as an attempted
kidnapping or murder.
   The break-in occurred at the suburban home of Gen. John W.
Douglass, deputy U.S. representative to NATO's military committee,
an embassy statement said.
   ``The officer was not at home at the time,'' said the statement.
An embassy official said he was out of the country.
   U.S. officials refused to speculate on the motive for the
attack, but it appeared they were taking the incident seriously.
   The two assailants bound and gagged an American security guard
at the general's home and used some type of solution to render him
unconscious, the embassy said. It said there was ``no evidence of
theft'' at Douglass' home in the eastern suburb of Kraainem.
   VTM reported at least three assailants hadwaited inside the
house and another outside using walkie-talkies. One of the men who
entered the house was wearing some type of uniform, it reported.
   Belgium police refused to comment.
   Callers to Douglass' office at NATO were told by a woman
answering the phone: ``You cannot talk to him.'' At his house
today, a guard told reporters the general was still out of town.
   Douglass has been assigned to the U.S. military delegation at
the North American Treaty Organization headquarters since summer
1989. NATO's military committee, made up of representatives of the
16 member nations, is the highest military authority in the Western
alliance.
   In June 1979, a remote-control device hidden in a culvert
exploded as U.S. Gen. Alexander Haig, then NATO's top military
commander in Europe, drove to his headquarters in southern Belgium.
   The explosion caused only slight damage to Haig's car, but the
security car behind him was destroyed. Haig was not injured. The
German terrorist group Red Army Faction claimed responsibility for
the attack, but Belgian authorities were unable to determine
positively who was responsible.

<HEAD>FDIC Raises Insurance Premiums for Banks By More than 60 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs lead to fix typo in ``percent''.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today
raised the insurance premium for commercial banks by more than 60
percent in a move aimed at bolstering its deteriorating insurance
fund.
   Starting next year, the rate will be 19.5 cents per $100 of
deposits, up from 12 cents this year. It is the maximum increase
allowed by law.
   The action came after the five-member board heard a financial
report showing that losses to the fund from bank failures were even
heavier than anticipated in the first half of this year.
   The fund decreased from $13.2 billion at the end of 1989 to
$11.4 billion at the end of June - a 14 percent drop.
   L. William Seidman, FDIC chairman, said he anticipated losses
for the year would be closer to $3 billion rather than the $2
billion he expected only one month earlier.
   The $1.84 billion loss in the first half of the year has reduced
the level of reserves in the fund to only 60 cents for $100 insured
deposits. The minimum level considered safe is $1.25 per $100.
   The level of reserves is at the lowest point in the fund's
history. The congressional General Accounting Office has warned
that if the economy dips into a recession, the fund could be wiped
out and require a taxpayer bailout.
   On Wednesday, a senior Treasury Department official and Sen.
Donald W. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, urged
enactment of legislation giving the FDIC power to raise premiums
higher and more often.
   A measure to do that passed the House last week. Riegle,
D-Mich., and Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber said
Congress must enact one before it adjourns early next month.
   Meanwhile, Glauber gave Riegle's panel an early look at a more
comprehensive plan to reform the banking system, which the
administration expects to propose for action next year.
   It would raise deposit insurance fees for reckless banks and
limit the number of insured accounts per depositor. Glauber also
suggested that the administration may seek to force banks to
conduct commercial real estate lending through separate affiliates
that would not use insured deposits.
   Glauber said the administration favors charging banks making
risky loans or operating with low capital more for insurance than
conservatively run banks. He said the Treasury is ``closely
examining'' proposals that would combine government deposit
insurance with private insurance to provide guidance for setting
premium levels.
   The administration also favors limiting the number of insured
accounts per depositor. Depositors can now insure far more than the
$100,000 per account limit by dividing their money among several
banks or among single, joint and trust accounts at a single
institution.
   Other proposed changes listed by Glauber were:
   -Limiting ``pass-through'' insurance for pension funds and other
large institutional investors. Under current rules, a deposit by a
pension fund with 100 members would have protection equaling 100
times the $100,000 insurance limit.
   -Forcing regulators to crack down on weak institutions before
they fail.
   -Requiring annual, on-site examinations of large banks and
ailing banks.
   A study by the Congressional Budget Office supported many of
Glauber's points. It backed risk-based insurance premiums, less
discretion by regulators over when to close an institution and
assumption of some portion of deposit insurance by private
companies. The study was presented Wednesday to Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   In another development, bankers and regulators from nine other
countries told U.S. officials at an international conference that
the United States had gone too far in protecting depositors, said
Seidman, the FDIC chairman.
   Seidman served as host of the closed-door conference, attended
by about 80 officials from the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and
Switzerland.
   At a news briefing, Seidman said most countries have private
systems protecting only the smallest depositors, although bank
regulators generally have the flexibility to decide on a
case-by-case basis whether to rescue the largest banks if needed to
prevent a shock to the banking system.
   Most attendees believed the United States should follow their
lead by employing ``constructive ambiguity'' as to whether a bank
will be rescued, Seidman said.

   Police defused a bomb today planted under a
lectern that a government minister, London's police chief and top
British and American experts were to use while addressing an
international conference on terrorism.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
Anti-Terrorist Squad, said the device contained enough explosives
to cause death and injury and was probably planted by the Irish
Republican Army. No group claimed responsibility for the bomb.
   The plastic lunch box containing the bomb was discovered by
security guards as delegates arrived for the conference at the
Royal Overseas League building on Park Place near Piccadilly in
central London, police and conference organizers said.
   The conference was postponed as police searched for a possible
second device, said Frank Brenchley, chairman of the Research
Institute for the Study of Confict and Terrorism. The institute
organized the conference.
   Scheduled speakers at the one-day conference included Foreign
Office Minister William Waldegrave, Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert and Professor Richard Shultz, of
Tufts University in Boston.
   Churchill-Coleman told a news conference he didn't believe the
device was aimed at a particular individual.
   ``The target of the device was the conference,'' he said. ``The
conference, which was widely advertised, would be seen as a
legitimate target by Irish Republican terrorist groups.''
   The IRA has targeted government officials and security forces in
its fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Churchill-Coleman said the lunch box ``contained a sufficient
high explosive that had the device exploded, which we believe would
have been around 10:30 a.m., it would have caused death and serious
injury.''
   He appealed for information on anyone seen in the area and
warned potential IRA targets: ``If you want to live, you must
continue to look and keep on looking.''
   Joan Bates, spokeswoman for the Research Institute for the Study
of Confict and Terrorism, said the package had been found
underneath the lectern where speakers would have been.
   All other buildings on Park Place were also evacuated and the
streets sealed off by police.
   Professor Paul Wilkinson of the University of St. Andrews in
Scotland, who is the institute's director and a leading British
expert on anti-terrorism, said ``extremely thorough'' security
arrangements had been made for the conference.
   ``An incident like this does remind you of the need for
alertness at all times and the professionalism and courage of those
whose daily duty it is to deal with emergencies of this sort,'' he
said.
   ``When you are studying a subject, you recognize there is a
constant problem and a large number of groups use this sort of
weapon. That is why it is important to study it and ways of
combating the threat more effectively.''

   The Vatican today welcomed the Soviet
Union's new law on freedom of conscience, saying it ``renders
justice to millions of believers.''
   The freedom of conscience law, promised by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev when he met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in
December, was approved Wednesday by the Soviet legislature.
   Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro expressed ``great
satisfaction'' and said the Vatican is now looking forward to the
approval of the various articles in the legislation.
   The law, formally ending decades of religious repression,
forbids the government from interfering with religious activities,
improves the legal status of religious organizations and gives
Soviet citizens the right to study religion in homes and in private
schools.
   It also paves the way for legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic
Church, whose suppression by Stalin in 1947 has been a major thorn
in Vatican-Soviet relations. Under the new law, the church can
apply to local authorities to regain lawful status.
   Gorbachev's historic meeting with the pope has already led to
the establishment of official ties between the Vatican and Moscow.
A resolution of the Ukrainian issue could lead to full ties and a
papal visit.

   Former President Ahmed Ben Bella
returned home today after a decade in exile and urged tens of
thousands of cheering supporters to volunteer to fight in support
of Iraq.
   He also called on Algeria's government to resign.
   Many people in a throng that greeted his ferry after an
overnight voyage from Spain waved posters of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein along with portraits of Ben Bella, leader of the Algerian
war for independence against France.
   ``Iraq needs support,'' said Ben Bella, 73, a fiery, hour-long
speech after coming ashore. ``Telephone the Iraqis, send telegrams
and tell them you are with them. Go by the hundreds of thousands to
the Iraqi Embassy and don't leave until they sign you up as
volunteers.''
   He urged supporters to stage a protest at the U.S. Embassy
denouncing the American military deployment in the Persian Gulf.
   More than 100,000 people massed along a seaside boulevard,
chanting Ben Bella's name, as the car ferry Hoggar arrived from
Barcelona. Other boats in the harbor blared horns and sirens in
welcome.
   Ben Bella said he hoped to weld a new political coalition that
would defeat the long-ruling National Liberation Front - to which
he once belonged. Legislative elections are scheduled for early
next year, but Ben Bella said the government should resign
immediately.
   ``I'm nervous to come back, but I'm very moved,'' he said as the
boat docked. ``We have huge problems in Algeria, and I hope I can
do something to restore our dreams.''
   He embraced his wife and children, who made the voyage with him.
Supporters on the ferry tossed posters and books over the railing
to people gathered on the dock.
   Bodyguards then escorted Ben Bella to shore, his first time back
in Algeria since he voluntarily went into exile in Europe in 1981.
   He became Algeria's first president in 1962 after the eight-year
independence war against France, but was overthrown in a military
coup in 1965 and imprisoned until shortly before he went into
exile.
   In his speech, delivered from a platform erected outside the
National Assembly building, Ben Bella described the international
mobilization against Iraq as a ``Zionist plot'' supported by the
United States.
   ``If they strike Saddam, that means they strike at us,'' he
said. ``We will hit back at everybody.''
   One of Ben Bella's former comrades-in-arms, Abdelkhadir Hadj,
rejoiced as the ferry docked. ``The country is free again,'' said
Hajd, 50. ``I knew one day democracy would triumph.''
   As the best-known leader of the war for independence, Ben Bella
adds a volatile ingredient to Algeria's experiment with democracy.
He returns home as Islamic fundamentalists stand poised to win
legislative elections in six months. With or without them, Ben
Bella hopes to forge a ``common front'' of dozens of disparate
opposition parties against the ruling party.
   Ben Bella had disappointed partisans by not returning for local
and regional elections June 12, Algeria's first multiparty
balloting since 1962.
   He advocated a boycott of those elections, claiming they would
be rigged by the National Liberation Front.
   The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front swept a majority of
local and regional councils in the vote, becoming the country's
dominant political group.
   Ben Bella has since raised his profile. He recently flew to Iraq
for talks with Saddam and has appeared on televised news shows in
Algeria and France.
   Ben Bella told Saddam that thousands of Algerians were ready to
fight on behalf of Iraq, a Moroccan newspaper reported last week.
   Despite his erratic three-year rule, Ben Bella retains an
immense personal stature among Algerians.
   Admirers say he alone can unite political factions and lift the
country out of economic misery marked by 25 percent unemployment.
   But critics note that he gave Algeria the Marxist command
economy, secret police and one-party rule it is only now shaking
off thanks to political reforms that began after October 1988
riots.

<HEAD>Mother's Helper Makes `Hell' For Couple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nanny from Montana became the ``au pair
from hell'' to a couple who says she wrecked their car and racked
up more than $70,000 in bad checks.
   Laurie Bronson and Robert Dolinko said they wanted a wholesome
live-in from the heartland to help out while Bronson spent the rest
of her pregnancy with her second child in bed on her doctor's
advice.
   What they got was Angela Marie Sandberg, 18, who was eventually
fired and pleaded no contest to a charge of passing bad checks,
police said.
   The couple hired Sandberg on July 16 through All-American
Childcare Inc., a company that supplies au pairs from the Midwest.
   ``We'd heard horror stories about the foreign girls who just
want to come to California for a good time,'' said Bronson, a
psychotherapist. ``So we thought, `Oh great, we'll get someone from
the Midwest.' ''
   Sandberg, from Lolo, Mont., bought a used MG Midget and
unsuccessfully tried to buy two new cars, said police Cpl. Michael
Sloan said. She wrecked the couple's car in July after driving it
to a nightclub, Bronson said.
   ``She is a personable, likeable, but naive girl who discovered a
real quick way to make money and didn't realize she would end up
getting put through the wringer for it,'' said police Cpl. Michael
Sloan.
   Sandberg was jailed after pleading no contest to one
check-passing charge, Sloan said. Other charges may be filed, he
said.
   The couple ended up with an ``au pair from hell story,'' Bronson
said.
   They fired her July 30, then their telephone started ringing.
Clothing boutique owners and grocers left with their ex-nanny's
checks wanted their money.
   Berkeley police arrested Sandberg Sept. 7 at an Emeryville motel
after her boyfriend tried to cash a $15,000 check she had written
to him so he could start his own business, Sloan said.
   All-American Childcare, based in Orange County, said a
background check on Sandberg with Montana authorities and former
employers turned up a clean record.
   Sandberg, held in lieu of $50,000, was scheduled for sentencing
Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Guardian Angels Vote to Leave Baltimore Due To Hostility,
Indifference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Guardian Angels have voted to take their
volunteer anti-crime patrols out of Baltimore, saying they face
hostility from police and the mayor refuses to intervene.
   The decision comes a week after the conviction of two Angels and
two former members on assault and false imprisonment charges for a
citizen's arrest of a suspected drug dealer that went awry.
   Founder Curtis Sliwa said the group will make daily visits to
Mayor Kurt Schmoke's office until Monday, when the 15 members of
the Baltimore chapter will join chapters elsewhere in Maryland.
   ``Our only hope is Mayor Schmoke,'' Sliwa said after Wednesday
night's vote.
   Schmoke, who usually doesn't deal directly with the news media,
was in a meeting and unavailable for comment this morning.
   His spokesman, Clint Coleman, said the mayor opposes the Angels'
policy of making citizens' arrests. He said he did not know if
Schmoke would meet with the Angels.
   ``The mayor has always welcomed citizen patrols in our
community. But, he has not been supportive of the Guardian Angels'
tactics of making citizen arrests. And that's simply because he
considers it too dangerous to both the Guardian Angels and
citizens,'' Coleman said.
   Most other chapters of the group, in 67 cities in the United
States and Canada, work successfully with police, Sliwa said. He
formed the group, recognizable by their red berets, in New York
City in 1979 to guard against muggings on the city's subways.
   The catalyst for the Angels departure was a judge's comments
last week comparing the group to the Ku Klux Klan. Baltimore
Circuit Court Judge David Mitchell made the remarks when he
accepted the guilty pleas from the two Angels and two oormer
members.
   ``Guardian Angels - that is a misnomer,'' Mitchell said. ``In my
mind, to this judge, I see no difference between what this
organization is and the Ku Klux Klan.''
   He called the group ``little boys dressed up like soldiers.''
   Sliwa responded that the judge ``obviously needs to get
mugged.''
   An Angel and two former members received sentences of probation
before judgment, meaning they won't have a record if they complete
three years of supervised probation. A second Angel, who had a
previous criminal conviction, was given a three-year suspended
sentence and three years' probation.
   The convictions stemmed from a July 24 citizens' arrest of a man
who needed 40 stitches to close cuts suffered during the incident.
   The Angels said the man was sniffing glue but police said they
found no evidence of that, prosecutor Barry Watson said. The man
was not charged. The Angels claim police lied.

   A 13-year-old boy who defended his mother while
she was being beaten by her boyfriend was shot in the head by the
man, police said.
   Reggie McIver of Baltimore was in critical but stable condition
at the University of Maryland Shock-Trauma Unit in Baltimore.
   The boyfriend, Kenneth Joyner, 21, of Baltimore surrendered to
police Wednesday and was being held on a charge of assault with
intent to murder after Tuesday night's shooting, police said.
   McIver's mother, 34-year-old Denise Edwards, said she was
confronted by Joyner because she was sitting on the front steps of
the home of another man.
   McIver happened by, saw Joyner hitting his mother and shouted,
`You're not going to hurt my mother,''' Edwards said.
   At that point Joyner pulled out a small Derringer-type handgun,
forced the boy face-down on a set of marble steps and shot him in
the back of the head, said Edwards.
   Joyner shook the boy, called his name, then said ``I'm sorry''
and ran off, Edwards said.

<TEXT>
   Seeking to quell rumors of a military coup, Soviet
media gave prominent coverage today to the defense minister's
assurance that recent troop movements were related to parade plans
and the potato harvest, not a plot.
   ``No army should use arms against its own people,'' Marshal
Dmitri Yazov told Parliament Wednesday in a 10-minute speech.
   His remarks were reported prominently today in the Communist
Party daily Pravda and the capital's Communist youth daily
Moskovsky Komsomolets. Sovietsksya Rossiya, a Russian federation
party and government paper, displayed a picture of paratroopers
digging potatoes near Moscow on its front page.
   Soviet television today broadcast Yazov's remarks in a midday
newscast.
   Yazov's comments followed two weeks of reports in liberal
newspapers and accusations by politicians that the military is
plotting to overthrow the government, which faces growing political
and economic crises.
   Such rumors have circulated sporadically throughout President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 5{-year rule, fueled in part by his supposed
alienation of the military brass because of his moves to cut troops
and the defense budget and use of soldiers to restore order in
restive republics.
   Such theorists hold that the military - fed up with soaring
crime, growing shortages and ethnic unrest - would ally itself with
the KGB and orthodox Communist Party apparatus and move against
Gorbachev.
   Only recently have newspapers such as Komsomolskaya Pravda,
Literaturnaya Gazeta and Moscow News - freed from strict official
supervision - begun examining the possibility of a military
overthrow.
   The reports have spoken of paratroopers dressed in combat gear,
bulletproof vests and helmets arriving at a military airfield near
Moscow. Some have even reported that the military leadership
already has a concrete plan to take control, region-by-region.
   Embroiled in confusion, protest and economic hard times, the
Soviet public has leaned toward believing the rumors, even though
the Soviet Union has never had a military coup.
   The latest publication, prompting Yazov's appearance before the
Supreme Soviet, was in Komsomolskaya Pravda, a youth newspaper, on
Wednesday.
   It spoke of alleged military plans to move against democratic
forces plotting to take over strategic points such as power
stations, television offices and railway terminals. Troops from
Ryazan and Tula were reportedly put in a state of combat readiness.
   The article ended by asking readers: ``Who - by design, out of
fear or guided by dangerous political ambitions - issued the order
to `take measures?' ... The sooner we find an answer, the safer we
shall feel.''
  Yazov, speaking to the Supreme Soviet, confirmed there were
troop movements in Moscow in recent weeks but said they were
related either to soldiers' participation in the traditional Nov. 7
Revolution Day parade or their help in gathering this year's record
harvest. He said it was normal for certain types of troops to
travel with ammunition and in military vehicles and denied soldiers
were put in a state of military readiness.
   ``All facts spelled out in this article are made up,'' declared
Yazov, wearing his drab green uniform emblazoned with a dozen rows
of medals.
   ``I again report fully and officially that our paratroopers and
other troops received no missions.''
   He then quoted from a statement by some legislators expressing
concern about the reported troop movements.
   ``No army should use arms against its own people. I agree with
this,'' he said. At the same time, however, Yazov did not take the
opportunity to reiterate his support for Gorbachev, who was not
present for the speech.
   Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov spoke for the political
leadership.
   ``Passions are now being fanned deliberately,'' said Lukyanov,
who holds powers similar to those of a vice president. ``The
passions are connected with some kind of plots and so forth.''
   The tense mood prevailed as well at a Wednesday evening meeting
of radical lawmakers from the national and Russian Federation
parliaments. Several speakers mentioned their fears of a military
coup.
   Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov was critical of the Supreme Soviet
for granting Gorbachev extraordinary powers and for being unable to
choose among competing economic plans.

   Britain today joined the United States in
rejecting an Iraqi threat to execute diplomats giving sanctuary to
Westerners in Baghdad.
   ``Iraq's threat makes it impossible to take seriously any
pretensions on its part to be a civilized state,'' the Foreign
Office said in a statement.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III first disclosed the threat
Wednesday, saying it was contained in an official statement Iraq
delivered earlier in the day to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that British and
other Western European diplomats in Baghdad received the
threatening note late Wednesday from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
   France also said its embassy in Baghdad received the note today,
and a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Paris called the threat
``utterly intolerable.'' He said France would consult with other
countries facing the same threat.
   The note said that giving sanctuary to a foreigner was
``espionage'' and Iraq would execute anyone commiting such a crime.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry refused to elaborate on the message
today, but Iraqi officials said it was referring to Iraqis
harboring Westerners, not to diplomats giving Westerners refuge.
   The Iraqi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the memo only contained a reminder of an Iraqi law, issued when
Iraq annexed Kuwait last month, which stipulated that those who
provide refuge for foreigners could be punished by death. The
officials said the law applies only to Iraqis.
   On Wednesday, Baker called the Iraqi threat ``repugnant'' and
rejected a demand for the names of people given sanctuary in the
U.S. embassies in Baghdad and Kuwait.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Britain regarded the note as a threat to kill its
diplomats. ``We have no option but to regard this as such a
threat,'' said the spokesman.
   He said some 50 Britons were being given refuge in the British
Embassy in Baghdad. The embassy also contains 11 diplomats and 11
support staff.
   The spokesman said Britain also would refuse to give Iraq a list
of the people who have found refuge in the embassy.
   The Foreign Office said it had received no subsequent indication
from the Iraqi authorities that the note was not intended as a
death threat.

   A blaze at an oil refinery sent
sheets of flame into the sky, forcing plant workers to evacuate and
officials to shut down a nearby highway for nearly three hours
early today.
   No injuries were reported in the fire that erupted Wednesday
night at the San Joaquin Refining Co., said Carl Nicita, a
dispatcher for the Kern County Fire Department.
   Ten workers were evacuated after the fire erupted in a refinery
tower at 11:15 p.m., Nicita said. Some 100 firefighters
extinguished the blaze by 2:30 a.m.
   The fire's cause was under investigation, although a leaky pump
that feeds oil from ground tanks to the 70-foot tower may have
contributed to the blaze, Nicita said. There was no immediate
damage estimate.
   State Route 99, which runs adjacent to the refinery, was closed
until just after 2 a.m. as a precaution, said California Highway
Patrol dispatcher Lolly Craig.
   Dave Hacker, of radio station KBAK, said the flames could be
seen from several miles away, prompting telephone calls from
concerned listeners.
   ``It was lighting up the sky,'' he said.

   Bombs exploded early today at two
U.S. pharmaceutical firms, and another device was defused at a
local branch of a U.S. bank in the sixth attack on an American firm
within 24 hours, police said.
   There was no claim of responsibility and no injuries in the
pre-dawn blasts, which followed explosions and attempted bombings
argeting American, Japanese and Hong Kong business interests.
   Police believe the attacks have been carried out by military
extremists seeking to topple President Corazon Aquino by
frightening away foreign investors and embarrassing the government
abroad.
   In a separate development in Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila,
unidentified men burned tires and threw homemade bombs before dawn
today along a highway about two miles from the U.S.-run Clark Air
Base. Police said there were no injuries during the protest, which
was apparently against the government's decision last week to raise
oil prices.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said he discussed the Manila
attacks today with Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and urged American
firms to ``hang in there and be careful.''
   Share prices plunged today to a 3{-year low on The Manila Stock
Exchange because of investor fears of more instability.
   In the first incident today, police defused a small bomb after
witnesses saw two men hurl a packet into the compound of the Boston
Bank of the Philippines in suburban Kalookan.
   Police said the bomb contained 10 sticks of dynamite and C-4
plastic explosives, which are issued to the armed forces and not
generally available from commercial sources.
   About a half hour later, two joggers threw a bomb at the
headquarters of the Squibb drug firm in suburban Makati. The bomb
exploded inside the compound but caused only minor damage, police
said.
   Minutes later, witnesses said two joggers also threw a device at
the headquarters of another American pharmaceutical firm - Wyeth
Suaco Laboratories. It also caused little damage.
   Police said the two bombs at the drug firm also contained
dynamite and C-4.
   ``Obviously the exercise is to frighten foreign investors
away,'' said Aurelio Periquet, president of the Philippine Chamber
of Commerce and Industry. ``The purpose is to destabilize the
political situation here.''
   The latest bombings brought to 31 the number of blasts in the
capital since Aug. 13. Manila's police commander, Brig. Gen. Marino
Filart, said it appeared most of the bombings were carried out by
right-wing extremists.
   Late Wednesday, a small bomb hurled from a passing car exploded
at the Colgate-Palmolive plant in Makati, shattering windows but
causing no injuries.
   Earlier Wednesday, small bombs also exploded at the Coca-Cola
and Pepsi bottling plants, and another device was defused at a
factory operated by the American electronics and communications
firm Motorola.
   Another bomb was discovered and defused in front of a Japanese
computer chip plant in the Taguig district.
   On Sunday, bombs exploded at the Mandarin Oriental, a Hong Kong
hotel chain, and the Nikko Manila Garden, a Japanese-run hotel.
   Eight people - four Japanese and four Filipinos - were slightly
injured in the Nikko Garden blast.

<HEAD>Cutting Torch Likeliest Cause of Metro Rail Tunnel Blaze, Probe
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blaze that destroyed an unfinished subway
tunnel and shut down a major highway last summer probably was
caused by a cutting torch, officials say.
   The July 13 fire in the downtown Metro Rail tunnel caused no
injuries or deaths but produced more than $2 million damage. The
750-foot tunnel, which passes under U.S. 101, partially collapsed.
The freeway was closed for days until it could be shored up.
   The report by the so-called Independent Investigation Team was
commissioned by Rail Construction Corp., a subsidiary of the Los
Angeles County Transportation Commission.
   The investigation did not rule out arson, but said the fire most
likely began with the use of a torchtto trim steel spikes in the
tunnel.
   The tunnel was shored up with timber. A polyethylene membrane
was installed over the timber to keep methane gas in the soil from
entering the tunnel.
   The report said the torch flame or hot metal slag probably
caused a timber to smolder. Seven or eight hours later, the fire
burned through the membrane and spread rapidly through the two
materials.
   The report said two earlier fires in the same 24-hour period had
been quickly extinguished.
   The Fire Department hasn't completed its investigation, and the
district attorney is investigating whether safety violations were a
factor.
   Ed McSpedon, Rail Construction's president and chief executive
officer, said Wednesday the firm has implemented a fire safety plan
that includes a constant fire watch at construction sites.
   In the future, pre-cast concrete liners will be used instead of
the timber and polyethylene combination, McSpedon said.
   The first 4.4-mile segment of the $3.3 billion subway is
scheduled to open in 1994. It is $135 million over budget and 18
months behind schedule. Metro Rail will eventually stretch 17 miles
from downtown to the San Fernando Valley.

   President Bush resumed his attack on
congressional Democrats today, saying they had delayed a budget
deal that would avoid deep spending cuts. Congressional leaders,
however, expressed optimism that a compromise may be near.
   ``There may be senior citizens wondering why their Social
Security checks are late,'' Bush said, referring to one effect of
federal cuts that will otherwise be triggered Monday. ``We can't
afford business as usual. The American people deserve better.''
   While Bush spoke at a campaign breakfast for Republicans in
Minneapolis, leading lawmakers said progress was being made in the
4-month-old budget negotiations.
   ``We're a little bit in the precincts of reaching a conclusion,
rather than at the wrap-up stage,'' said House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash. ``A good deal has been agreed to tentatively.''
   ``They're basically there outside of capital gains,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass. ``Get rid of that darned thing, we're home
free.''
   Bush has tempered his demand for a lower capital gains tax rate,
which has been the major obstacle to a budget pact.
   Should no action be taken by Monday, the start of the 1991
fiscal year, government spending will be slashed by $85 billion and
many of its 2.4 million civilian workers will face payless days off
as the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law takes effect.
   Wednesday's bargaining session capped a day in which
participants said Bush was moving toward defusing the prickliest
issue remaining between the two sides: whether tax rates on capital
gains should be dropped.
   But the president and Democratic congressional leaders also
traded accusations that the other side was jeopardizing the
negotiations.
   ``If and when the ax falls, the Democratic Congress knows that
it will be held accountable,'' Bush told a Republican campaign
rally in Akron, Ohio.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, fired back, saying the remarks
could damage the talks.
   ``Ironically, I thought we were making progress,'' Mitchell
said.
   Bargainers also reported progress at recent sessions in
narrowing differences between the two sides over defense cuts and
reductions in domestic programs. The overall goal is to take a $500
billion bite out of the federal deficit over five years.
   Since talks began in May, Bush has sought to honor a campaign
pledge and lower the rates of the capital gains tax, which is
charged on profits from the sale of real estate and other
investments.
   Democrats say the proposal, which Bush contends would spur the
economy, would merely put money in the pockets of wealthy property
owners. They have demanded tax hikes for the rich as a tradeoff.
   Administration bargainers offered to leave the capital gains tax
rate at current levels, in exchange for exempting the increased
value of assets due to inflation, said officials who asked not to
be identified.
   ``I think it's still a very viable option,'' said one Republican
official.
   Democrats brushed aside the idea, one official said. But there
were other signs of a new White House flexibility on the issue.
   Republican lawmakers who met with Bush at the White House early
Wednesday said that rather on insisting on a capital gains tax cut,
the president was demanding a package with items intended to spur
economic growth. These might include tax breaks for companies that
conduct research or do business in deteriorating cities or rural
areas, the Republicans said.
   ``A number of options have come up,'' Foley said during a break
in the closed-door budget talks. ``But whether they can be called a
true alternative (to a capital gains tax cut) is debatable.''
   The two top Republicans in Congress, Michel and Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., have already said a reduction in the
capital gains tax rate should not be an absolute demand at the
negotiations.
   Bargainers racing to hammer out a deal faced a dwindling number
of days in which to act. With Congress planning to recess from
Friday afternoon through Saturday for the Jewish holiday of Yom
Kippur, a full-fledged Sunday session seemed likely.
   The House was ready to vote on a bill temporarily financing the
government beyond Sunday, when its authority to spend money
expires.
   The measure contained language delaying the spending cuts.
Administration officials said that unless a budget deal was
reached, they would oppose a postponement of the reductions as a
way of pressuring the bargainers.
   Domestic programs would be slashed by 32.4 percent and defense
programs by 35.3 percent if the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts take
effect Monday.
   Social Security, the military payroll and many benefits for
veterans and low-income people are exempt from the cuts.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, concerned about price
speculation, has ordered the sale of 5 million barrels of oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to fight escalating prices. The
administration said today the oil would be available on the market
in about two weeks.
   Bush said Wednesday he was prepared to take additional steps if
``intensive and unwarranted speculation'' continues.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated the move was as
much to warn off price escalation as to test the reserve system.
   But Energy Secretary James Watkins told the House Energy and
Commerce Committee today the sale is just a test set in the law by
Congress earlier this month.
   ``This is not an emergency drawdown of the reserve,'' Watkins
said. ``But, it will clearly ... be an important factor should it
become necessary in the future to conduct an emergency strategic
stock drawdown in coordination with our allies.''
   Bob Porter, an Energy Department spokesman, said the department
expects to put the oil on sale between Oct. 12 and 15.
   Under the sale, about 167,000 barrels of oil - far short of the
500,000 barrels analysts say would be needed to drive prices down
significantly - will be released daily for 30 days, Porter said.
   At a fund-raising breakfast this morning for Minnesota
Republican gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth, Bush praised ``the
commitment of U.S. servicemen and women to contain aggression.''
   He also said the ``most meaningful and most hopeful sign for
change in the world'' is the cooperative effort demonstrated by the
United States and the Soviet Union in opposing Iraq's aggression.
   The petroleum reserve, now containing 590 million barrels, was
established in 1975 to ward against potential future oil shortages.
   The president said he wanted to test the process of drawing down
the reserve. He said the country has ``sufficient oil to meet
current needs,'' and added that ``there is no justification for the
intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures.''
   Oil prices have skyrocketed to nearly $40 a barrel since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the United Nations imposed a trade
embargo against Baghdad.
   Bush's decision marks the first time the government has tapped
into the reserve. It comes at a time when the administration says
there is not an oil shortage, but as officials are warning the
Middle East crisis could result in tight supplies by the end of the
year.
   ``We've been suggesting this to him,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. But
he said the administration needs to call on West Germany and Japan
to also tap their stockpiles.
   Administration oficials do not use the word gouging, but claim
that the price escalation is unwarranted.
   Bush said Wednesday: ``At home and abroad, let me caution those
who might take advantage of the current crisis in the Persian Gulf,
those who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions, or here at
home, those speculators who might try to drive up the price of
oil.''
   Oil supplies were reduced by the international embargo against
Kuwait and Iraq, following Iraq's invasion of its neighbor. But
industry experts estimate production in other countries has
restored about two-thirds of the 4.8 million daily barrels of oil
production removed from world markets by the embargo.
   The United States uses more than 17 million barrels a day, about
half of it imported.
   With winter heating needs approaching, ``We do anticipate that
there could be shortages and that we could have a need to rely on
the petroleum reserve in a more permanent fashion,'' Fitzwater
said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Announces His Resignation From Bench</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he is going to resign from
the bench, mainly because he's unhappy with sentencing guidelines
enacted by Congress.
   U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said Wednesday he plans
to notify President Bush that he will resign effective Dec. 31.
   Irving, 55, a 1982 Reagan appointee, said the strict guidelines
- which sharply reduce a judge's discretion in sentencing convicted
criminals - have taken much of the enjoyment out of being a federal
judge.
   ``To me the job just isn't as much fun as it used to be,'' he
said. ``The purpose of the guidelines is admirable - to do away
with disparity in sentencing. It just doesn't work out that way.''
   In a March 1988 case, Irving declared the sentencing guidelines
unconstitutional, joining three other federal judges in San Diego
who had issued similar rulings. They were among the first in the
nation to challenge the standards, which were upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court in January 1989.
   Irving said he believes he's the first judge in the nation to
quit because of the rules.
   Federal judges, appointed by the president and approved by the
Senate, have life tenure. They earn about $96,000 a year, and that
will rise to $120,653 in February.
   The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 established a sentencing
commission that set the new guidelines, which took effect in
November 1987.
   The guidelines use a point system based mainly on the severity
of the crime to determine sentences. A person's background, role in
the crime, past record or remorse cannot be used to reduce the
sentence below the minimum guideline.
   ``It used to be that a judge could do some good in sentencing''
by being lenient when leniency was called for, he said. ``Now I
can't do that.''
   ``I'll tell you, it really tugs at your heart when you have to
sentence a first-time offender to a 10-year minimum-mandatory
(sentence) or a 15-year minimum-mandatory, with no parole.''

   Mayor Marion Barry met today with protest
leaders at the University of the District of Columbia, where
students were occupying two buildings and demanding the resignation
of most of the school's trustees.
   Mark Thompson, a protest leader at the 12,000-student public
university, said the demonstration was prompted by ``our disgust
with the board of trustees.''
   ``This school is in a situation of disarray,'' Thompson said.
``Our accreditation is in jeopardy and that is a direct result of
the board of trustees.''
   He also said months of attempts to resolve some of their
grievances through negotiation had failed.
   Thompson said the students would remain in the buildings until a
list of demands were met by the administration, including one that
Barry dismiss 11 of the school's 15 trustees.
   A university spokesman, John Britton, announced that the
university would be closed for the day.
   ``We're asking students to boycott classes,'' Thompson said.
``Students should not come to any classes until all our demands
were met.''
   Members of the student government and others took control of a
building that houses the university radio station, bookstore and
several offices and classrooms late Wednesday after blocking
entrances earlier.
   About 200 students subsequently shoved their way past four
security guards standing in a doorway to take control of the main
administration building.
   The students met briefly with UDC interim President Miles Fisher
IV outside his office after forcing their way into the building.
They agreed to leave a third-floor area housing offices of the
school's top administrators after Fisher agreed to surrender the
rest of the building to them.
   UDC trustees who attended an emergency meeting off campus sent
two of their members to the school to discuss the terms and
conditions of a meeting, but they were rebuffed by students.
   Students entered and left the occupied buildings freely, taking
in pillows and blankets and market baskets filled with groceries
and taking out bags of garbage.
   Part of the protest involved the university's plans to spend
$1.6 million to renovate a library so that a controversial artwork,
``The Dinner Party,'' can be installed there.
   The House of Representatives voted to cut that same amount from
UDC's operating budget after some lawmakers described the artwork
as obscene.
   The work is a large ceramic sculpture that depicts the history
of women in 39 place settings, some of which contain images of
female genitalia.
   The students also complained about the turnover rate for faculty
and administrators and the school's athletic program.

   A team from a U.S. warship in the Red Sea
boarded an Iraqi tanker today after firing warning shots when
orders to stop were ignored, the Pentagon said.
   But tanker Tadmur was allowed to proceed after it was found to
be empty, the Pentagon said..
   The U.S.S. Elmer Montgomery, a frigate, fired bursts of .50
caliber machine gun fire across the bow of the tanker in an
incident that began at 6 a.m. EDT, said spokesman Pete Williams.
   A Coast Guard and Navy team then boarded the Tadmur, Williams
said.
   He said the tanker, built in 1976, weighed 1,598 gross tons and
was 270 feet long. The Tadmur, he said, was heading South out of
the Gulf of Aqaba into the northern Red Sea when it was boarded.
   More than 1,400 hundred ships have been intercepted since the
United Nations imposed an economic embargo against Iraq after its
Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait, Williams said.
   More than 125 ships have been boarded, 110 of them by U.S.
vessels and 15 by the ships of other navies which are assisting in
the embargo.
   He said six of the intercepted ships had been diverted and six
had been boarded.

   A county judge said he would take over
questioning of potential jurors today if lawyers in the nation's
first obscenity trial of a museum and its director failed to make a
more serious effort to seat a jury.
   ``I'm going to have to do something to move this along,''
Hamilton County Judge David Albanese said.
   He had said Wednesday that the court would remain in session as
long as necessary today to get a jury seated.
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
face misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and displaying nude
photos of children in an exhibit of photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe, a homosexual who died of AIDS last year.
   By Wednesday, lawyers had rejected eight prospective jurors and
tentatively seated seven.
   Albanese warned attorneys to limit their questions to those that
would determine whether a juror could be fair and impartial.
   ``They're not going to be educated in the law or indoctrinated
into cases of the state or defense,'' the judge said.
   While defense lawyers had sought to expose bias toward
homosexuals, potential jurors must distinguish between art and
obscenity in weighing the charges over seven of the 175 photos from
the exhibit.
   One photo shows a man urinating into another man's mouth. Others
show anal penetration with objects and other homosexual or
sadomasochistic images.
   On Wednesday, the defense persuaded the judge to remove two
prospective jurors who admitted they were prejudiced against
homosexuals.
   Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, asked one potential juror,
``Was that a strike against the Contemporary Arts Center to know it
was exhibiting works of a homosexual?''
   She replied that it was not.
   Each side is allowed six peremptory removals for which the
lawyers need not give a reason, and an unlimited number of
challenges for cause, in which they must convince a judge that the
juror is biased.
   Prosecutors have used three peremptory challenges to remove a
man and a woman who saw the exhibit, and a man who said adults do
not need the protection of obscenity laws.
   If convicted of both charges, Barrie, 43, could be sentenced to
a year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery could be fined
$10,000.
   The exhibit, now concluding a national tour in Boston, drew more
than 80,000 viewers during its seven-week Cincinnati exhibition
ending in May.
   Lawyers also have tried to determine potential jurors' opinions
about pornography, the role of an art museum and the types of
photographs that should be allowed to be exhibited.
   Barrie's attorney, H. Louis Sirkin, asked one woman if she had
stayed away from the exhibit because of its content.
   ``No,'' she said. ``It rained the day I was going to go.''
   Defense attorneys rejected two potential jurors who indicated
they were unfamiliar with the community's social standards, and one
woman who said she would give ``God's law'' priority over ``man's
law'' in deciding if the photos are obscene.
   Under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, material alleged to be
obscene must be judged according to the community's standards.

<HEAD>Kentucky Woman Says Federal Inspectors Partly to Blame for Fatal
Blast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of a Kentucky coal miner said today
federal inspectors are partly to blame for a methane explosion that
killed 10 miners because of their ``lax inspection policy.''
   Sharon Scott, 36, said the Mine Safety and Health Administration
knew prior to the September 1989 blast near Wheatcroft, Ky., that
water had backed up in the mine, jeopardizing ventilation.
   ``MSHA inspectors routinely failed to order remedial measures
for safety violations that they did see,'' Mrs. Scott told the
House Education and Labor Committee's health and safety
subcommittee.
   William J. Tattersall, assistant labor secretary for mine safety
and health, acknowledged there were ``shortcomings'' in MSHA's
enforcement of regulations at the Pyro Mining Co. mine where the
blast occurred.
   But he said those shortcomings did not cause the explosion.
Tattersall said enforcement had been stepped up at the mine, but
the sanctions imposed by inspectors were not strong enough to
change Pyro's ``poor attitude about safety, poor safety management
and disregard of the law.''
   James Greenlee, executive vice president of Costain Coal Inc.,
based in Evansville, Ind., and owner of Pyro Mining, declined to
comment at length on the hearing. ``Obviously, we would not agree
with Mr. Tattersall's analysis of our performance,'' he said.
   The federal government has proposed fines of more than $500,000
against Pyro for 121 alleged violations of federal safety laws,
some of them which allegedly were directly linked to the explosion.
   Mrs. Scott, who is a coal miner, was working in a different part
of the mine when the blast occurred and she escaped. She fought
back sobs as she told the committee about the events leading up to
the explosion that killed her husband, Curtis, and nine others.
   She said that Pyro managers frequently made miners hide safety
violations from federal inspectors. On one occasion, Mrs. Scott
said, she was ordered to stick blasting caps inside her blouse so
that the inspectors would not discover that blasting had been done.
   ``I do not believe that MSHA should be held responsible for
facts that were hidden from them by mine management,'' Mrs. Scott
said, but she added that federal inspectors simply overlooked many
dangerous violations.
   ``I believe this lax inspection policy and carefree attitude
about ordering management to correct dangers makes MSHA partially
responsible for the deaths of my husband and friends,'' she said.

   A powerful earthquake struck about 930
miles southeast of Tehran outside of Iranian territory, Iran's
official news agency reported Thursday.
   The quake, measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
struck shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday and was felt in southeastern
border areas of Iran including Zahedan, a provincial capital near
the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Islamic Republic News

   The news agency, which is monitored in Nicosia, reported that
the Geophysics Center of Tehran University said the quake was too

   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

   She underwent a sex change operation in 1974, but is forbidden
by law to marry in Britain because her birth certificate says she
was born a male.
   The Strasbourg court, following its decision in a similar
transsexual case two years ago, ruled on a 14-4 vote that British
policy is fair and that Cossey's human rights had not been
violated.
   The court also rejected her claim that she was being denied the
fundamental right to marry contained in the European Convention on
Human Rights.
   The court affirmed its support for ``the traditional concept of
marriage.'' It noted that there was no legal obstacle preventing
Cossey from marrying a woman.
   Born with the name Barry Kenneth, she adopted the name Caroline
at the age of 18. She initiated the legal challange with the
Strasbourg court in 1984.

   The Air Transport Association of America asked
President Bush today to allow air traffic controllers and other
essential Federal Aviation Administration employees to continue
working if a budget agreement is not reached by the start of the
new fiscal year on Monday.
   ``Your action would ensure continuity in the day-to-day
operation of our air traffic control system,'' Robert J. Aaronson,
president of the industry association, wrote to the president.
   ``This is essential to protect the overall public interest as
well as the continuing viability of the nation's airline industry
and the many other industries which depend on it,'' Aaronson said.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Stephen Hart said the White
House would make no response unless deep budget cuts required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law go into effect on Monday
because an agreement has not been reached.
   White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu told Senate
Republicans on Tuesday that an attorney general's opinion issued
late in the Carter administration would be relied on to keep
essential personnel at work.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said this probably would mean that the air traffic
controllers would continue working.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Emir an Autocrat Who Tolerated Some Dissent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four months ago, 70 professors staged a sit-in
at Kuwait University to protest a decree limiting the powers of
parliament. It was an act of defiance hardly imaginable in most of
the Persian Gulf, ruled by a collection of dictators, hereditary
monarchs and fundamentalist leaders.
   But Kuwait's 64-year-old emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
was different. A contradictory jumble of benevolent father,
autocrat and parlor liberal, the emir has tolerated other voices.
   Shrewdly, the al-Sabah family has shared Kuwait's vast wealth
with their countrymen, ensuring a measure of loyalty.
   Even at the height of pro-democracy demonstrations last winter,
no one was calling for the al-Sabah's ouster - they were asking for
more power sharing.
   President Bush has invited al-Sabah here Friday to show Iraq
that the United States still views the emir as the legitimate ruler
of Kuwait. U.S. insistence that al-Sabah be restored to power is
second only to its demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait.
   Some lawmakers criticize the U.S. stance toward the autocratic
government.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Mideast affairs
subcommittee, has said that unconditional support for al-Sabah
``would put us in conflict with the worldwide trend toward
democracy, as well as with out own democratic values.''
   But unlike Latin America and other parts of the world where the
United States has made demands for democracy a pillar of its
foreign policy, stability is the main U.S. goal in the oil-rich
Persian Gulf.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said this is not the time
to insist on reforms.
   ``The one thing we have to be careful about is getting into the
position of saying that because a particular former government ...
was not a form of government that we prefer, therefore, we somehow
change that or participate in changing that form of government,''
he said. ``That would be nothing more than rewarding Saddam
Hussein's aggression.''
   Since assuming leadership in 1977, al-Sabah walked a precarious
line between progressive forces at home who wanted democracy and
repressive forces next door in Saudi Arabia who feared democracy
might spread and endanger their conservative, theocratic rule.
   But unlike the Saudi king, al-Sabah allowed a lively media
albeit one periodically reined in with censorship. Unlike Saudi
laws, Kuwait's allowed women to drive and vote.
   There was nothing clandestine about the Kuwaiti opposition,
which enjoyed wide support among the country's merchants and
leading families.
   ``They discussed, argued, talked back to'' the emir, said Judith
Kipper, a Mideast expert at the Brookings Institution.
   The al-Sabah clan, which has ruled Kuwait for more than 200
years, experimented with parliamentary elections several times
since gaining independence from Britain in 1961. But each time, the
legislature was decreed shut when lawmakers became too critical of
the government or of other regional leaders.
   Last June, the emir tried again. This time, he named one third
of the 75 deputies and the rest were elected. The professors were
among several groups to voice outrage at the emir's decree, which
they said violated the constitution.
   Kuwaitis have one of the highest per capita incomes in the
world, about $20,000 a year, and the al-Sabah clan is greatly
admired for its shrewd investment of the oil wealth.
   The family business - some 1,000 al-Sabah princes fill key
government and financial posts - brought in more from investments
last year than from oil revenue.
   The clan's legitimacy derives in large measure from its
longevity. It ruled uninterrupted from 1751, through British
control from 1899 to 1961, and until it was forced to flee ahead of
invading Iraqi troops Aug. 2. Most got away to Saudi Arabia.
   The emir's young brother was killed defending the family palace.
   It was a measure of al-Sabah's acceptance that when Iraq tried
to install a provisional government of Kuwaiti dissidents, not one
serious participant was found.
   But the al-Sabah benevolence did not extend to the expatriates
who accounted for more than 60 percent of Kuwait's 1.9 million
people. Foreigners were excluded from the perks of citizenship such
as land ownership.
   Two serious violations of traffic laws, for example, could
result in summary deportation. For thousands of impoverished Asians
and Arabs, menial work in Kuwait was a livelihood they could ill
afford to lose.
   ``Kuwaitis looked down on other Arabs,'' said Hooshang
Amirahmadi, head of the Middle East Studies Department at Rutgers
University. Kuwaitis had a special name for the Palestinians,
Egyptians and other Arabs who worked there - ``khadama'' meaning
servants, he said.
   That attitude accounts in part for the bitter resentment of
Kuwait that led some Arab governments to gleefully support the
Iraqi invasion.
   Kuwaitis, too, were growing dissatisfied with al-Sabah,
especially after seeing the revolutions that overthrew the
Communist rulers of Eastern Europe last winter.
   If al-Sabah is reinstated, Kuwaitis are certain to demand
change.
   Kipper predicts upheavals throughout the region.
   ``The invasion,'' she said, ``will be their fall of the Berlin
Wall.''

<HEAD>Mulroney Gets Permission to Expand Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney received permission
today from Queen Elizabeth II to expand the Canadian Senate.
Mulroney wants the eight additional senators to push through a
controversial new tax.
   The eight have been notified of their appointments, and they
will likely be named today, government sources in Ottawa said. An
opposition leader called Mulroney's unprecedented move
``unbelievable.''
   Mulroney made the request based on an obscure section of the
1867 Constitution as a last resort to save the unpopular goods and
services tax.
   Such a request had only been made once before in Canada's
123-year history, and that appeal was not granted.
   The section of the Constitution allows the British monarch to
add four or eight members to the Senate on a request by the
governor-general, the Canadian representative to the Commonwealth.
   John Haslam, a spokesman for the queen, said in London that
Elizabeth, as the constitutional monarch of the former British
colony, was following the provisions of the Canadian Constitution
in making the decision.
   The measure would expand the Senate to 112 seats from 104 and
establish a slim Tory plurality. The new senators will be appointed
by Mulroney and therefore be members of his Conservative Party.
   But even with the additional seats, the fate of the tax could
rest on the votes of a handful of Independents.
   The Liberals now hold 52 seats and the Tories 46, with one
Reform Party representative, four Independents and one Independent
Liberal.
   Mulroney said he wanted to increase the number of Conservative
senators to push through the tax despite Liberal opposition in the
Senate.
   Liberal Party leader Jean Chretien was incredulous after
learning of Mulroney's latest move - particularly in view of the
prime minister's low standing in recent public opinion polls.
   ``It's unbelievable that they'd do that,'' he said. ``At 15
percent in the polls, using the Queen.''
   Such a move was tried only once before. Prime Minister Alexander
Mackenzie, a Liberal, made such a request in 1873, but the British
Cabinet did not advise the Queen to appoint the additional
senators.
   Such a move by Mulroney could touch off a legal dispute.
   British Columbia has said it will challenge Ottawa's ability to
create the extra Senate seats, and Ontario has said it may join
that campaign. Alberta has promised a separate challenge on some
aspects of the tax itself.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Edward VIII, who abdicated in 1936 to marry
an American divorcee, lied about the size of his fortune, pleading
poverty to secure a royal income before going into exile, his first
official biography said Thursday.
   Author Philip Ziegler has written ``King Edward VIII: The
Official Biography'' with the approval of Queen Elizabeth II,
Edward's niece.
   Working from the archives of Buckingham Palace and government
papers, Ziegler reveals that Edward told a meeting of his family
and their advisers that his income would hardly be $22,500 a year
and that his total fortune was $405,000.
   As a result, he was guaranteed a yearly income of $94,500, on
condition that he went abroad and would not return without
government consent. He immediately left for France, taking the
title Duke of Windsor.
   Ulick Alexander, Keeper of the Privy Purse, later calculated
that Edward's fortune amounted to nearly $5 million, excluding real
estate in Canada. The sum would be equivalent to $43 million at
present-day values.
   When this was told to King George VI, who had succeeded his
brother on the throne, he wrote to Edward three months after the
abdication: ``You were under great strain and I am not seeking to
reproach you or anyone, but the fact remains that I was badly
misled.''
   Ziegler says the financial arrangements for Edward's future did
more than anything else to poison the atmosphere between him and
his family. Their relations remained strained for the rest of his
life.
   In June 1937, six months after abdicating, Edward married Wallis
Warfield Simpson of Baltimore in a private ceremony at the Chateau
de Cande near Paris.
   Mrs. Simpson had divorced her first two husbands, Lt. Winfield
Spencer of the U.S. Navy, and Ernest Simpson, a U.S.-born British
citizen who was a stockbroker in London.
   Edward abdicated because his insistence on marrying a divorcee
created a constitutional crisis: the monarch is temporal head of
the state Church of England which opposes divorce.
   The duke was governor of Bahamas during World War II and
subsequently lived in France, where he died at age 77 in 1972. The
Duchess of Windsor died in 1986 at age 89.
   The duke was always bitter that King George VI did not grant the
title ``Her Royal Highness'' to his wife, and Ziegler says the
royal advisers and law officers had grave doubts about the legality
of depriving the duchess of the title.
   But a conviction that the marriage would not last long seemed to
have been an important factor in the decision, the author says.
   King George VI told Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin:
   ``Is she a fit and proper person to become a Royal Highness
after what she has done in this country? And would the country
understand it if she became one automatically on marriage? ... I,
my family and Queen Mary (his mother) all feel that it would be a
great mistake to acknowledge Mrs. Simpson as a suitable person to
become royal. The monarchy has been degraded quite enough
already.''
   Ziegler's book, published by Collins at about $38, is the most
complete account of the abdication crisis to date.
   The 60-year-old author is a former publisher's editor. He has
written 11 books of history and biography and edited the diaries of
Adm. Lord Louis Mountbatten, a relative of the royal family and
last viceroy of India.

<HEAD>Bush Seeking $7.5 Billion Arms Sale to Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with proposal, snag on resolution supporting
Bush</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Congress today to approve
a $7.5 billion package of new arms for Saudi Arabia, including
missiles, tanks and other weapons to beef up the Saudi military
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush's arms sale proposal included 150 M-1A2 tanks, 1,750
advanced TOW anti-tank missiles and 6 Patriot anti-missile
batteries, according to a formal request to Congress.
   The package also included 200 Bradley armored fighting vehicles,
12 Apache ground-attack helicopters, nine multiple-launch rocket
systems, seven KC-130 tanker planes and 10,000 trucks, transporters
and trailers.
   In another development, House members hit snags when they sought
to move ahead with a resolution backing Bush's moves in the Persian
Gulf crisis. The House Foreign Affairs Committee adjourned without
action on a proposed resolution of support.
   Speaking of the Saudi arms proposal, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.,
said, ``This is a significant improvement.'' Levine, a staunch
supporter of Israel who had objected to an earlier $21 billion
Saudi arms package that also drew objections from Israel, said,
``This is what should have been proposed in the first place.''
   Levine said lawmakers concerned about Israel's security support
Bush's military moves to counter Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
But the earlier, larger arms sale proposal appeared to be an
attempt ``to use the crisis as justification for sending items not
needed for the crisis,'' he said.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said the proposed sale
is ``urgently needed.''
   But some supporters of Israel said there still was concern about
offensive weapons included in the new package. They said those
worries could be calmed if the administration comes up with a
counterbalancing security package for Israel.
   Meanwhile, a tentative agreement that had been reached late
Wednesday between the White House and the Democratic-controlled
Foreign Affairs Committee began to unravel amid Democrats' fears
that the document implied congressional consent for future military
action in the Middle East.
   ``Some members think there's an implication of the use of
force'' later in the crisis, said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., fumed that it was ``amazing
that we can get approval through the United Nations for the
president's actions, but not through the Congress... I think it's
unfortunate that we can't even get approval when we've got 80
percent of the American people behind the president.''
   The administration has decided to divide the Saudi arms package
into two parts: one to meet immediate Saudi defense needs in the
current crisis, including weapons that can be delivered from
current stocks or quickly taken off the production line; and a
second, $14 billion package to be proposed in January to meet the
country's longer-term needs.
   The latter package will include F-15F fighter planes and more
tanks, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
delay will give lawmakers more time to deliberate how the sale
might change the military balance in the volatile region, Levine
said.
   At the same time, the administration has been discussing a new
package of military aid to Israel and senior officials have
promised to maintain Israel's qualitative military advantage over
neighboring states.
   In deliberations a day earlier two Foreign Affairs subcommittees
sought to make it clear their support for Bush's moves so far did
not imply authorization for future military action.
   ``We have no interest in providing conditional authority to the
president with regard to future military actions,'' committee
Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said during a meeting of the Middle
East and arms control subcommittees on Wednesday.
   ``We will deal with that, judge that, as the American people
will, if and when that time arrives,'' Fascell said.
   Action by the full committee would culminate a week-long
internal debate between lawmakers who believe Congress should take
a formal part in the gulf situation and those who prefer to keep
their political distance from it. Similar talks are under way in
the Senate.
   ``I think it's important for Congress to act here,'' said
Hamilton, chairman of the Middle East subcommittee. ``I know some
of our colleagues would prefer not to take any action. But this is
... one of the most significant foreign policy moves in a long
time. I would be uncomfortable if we ignored it.''
   The resolution condemns the invasion of Kuwait and supports
Bush's diplomatic efforts and use of the United Nations to bring
international pressure on Iraq to leave Kuwait and release
hostages.
   ``The United States shall, to the extent possible, use
diplomatic and other non-military means in order to achieve those
objectives and policies, while maintaining credible United States
and multinational deterrent military force,'' the resolution says.
   Fascell said he does not consider the resolution to trigger the
War Powers Act, which would start the clock running on a 60-day
limit to the U.S. troop deployment. He said Bush has consulted well
with Congress and met the objectives of the War Powers Act, and a
confrontation with the White House over the law's technicalities
would not be useful.
   The resolution also calls for continued international efforts to
contain Iraq's military might, including proliferation of ballistic
missiles and weapons of mass destruction, and reaffirms the U.S.
policy of maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge over its
neighbors.

<HEAD>Officials Say Sudan Tries To Bomb Food Shipments While Asking for
More</HEAD>

   Administration officials expressed outrage
Thursday over a Sudanese government request for $150 million in
food aid at a time when, they said, its air force is bombing
humanitarian relief sites, including a Red Cross food barge, in
rebel areas.
   Sudanese officials submitted their request this week as Bush
administration officials held high-level meetings to devise ways to
help that country out of what may become the worst of several food
crises in recent years.
   ``The problem is so big, we're really at a loss on how to
proceed,'' said one official.
   The officials said one target of the bombing raids is a food
barge donated by the Norwegian government to the International
Committee for the Red Cross. The barge has been located in the Nile
River adjacent to the southern Sudan town of Bor, a main transit
point for relief supplies, they said.
   ``I think it's almost unimaginable that a government facing a
(famine) disaster of epic proportions would have the audacity to
bomb food shipments at the same time they are asking for more food
assistance,'' said Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   Natsios and other officials said Air Force bombs have rained
down on Bor and other towns where international relief programs are
in operation. They are run by the World Food Program, the United
Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee
for the Red Cross.
   According to Natsios, the areas which have been subject to air
raids recently all had been designated as off limits to offensive
military operations by the government and had been regarded as safe
for the relief operations.
   Two officials, who discussed the issue on condition of
anonymity,
   disagreed as to whether the headquarters of these relief
operations were targets of the air raids. One official said he
believes the real targets were rebel military encampments but
another said the Sudanese government is eager to stop the relief
efforts because they assist people in rebel-held areas.
   ``The objective is to run UNICEF out,'' the official said.
UNICEF runs intensive feeding programs, child immunization programs
and other ``militarily threatening programs'' he noted with heavy
sarcasm.
   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir plans to join about 70 other
heads of government this weekend at the United Nations for the
World Summit for Children. President Bush also plans to attend.
   A Sudanese Embassy official had no comment on the U.S.
allegations, saying, ``We have no news from the Sudan at this
time.''
   The United States has for years been attempting to persuade both
sides in Sudan's civil war to agree to a cease fire. The war
involves the largely Moslem north against the mostly non-Moslem
south.
   Richard Reid, the regional UNICEF director for the Middle East
and North Africa, said he was aware of bombing raids in the Bor
area but was unable to say who the planes belonged to.
   He said 250,000 persons died in Sudan two years ago from disease
and starvation but that a major international effort called
Operation Lifeline Sudan succeeded in preventing a similar calamity
last year.
   This year, he said, ``we're facing a repetition of 1988 because
crop failures have set in. We're facing a human tragedy that could
surpass 1988.'' The $150 million Sudanese food aid request would
provide about 970,000 tons of wheat, 10 times more than the amount
sent last year under the lifeline program.

   Democrat Howell Heflin pokes fun at
``Gucci-poochie'' Republicans and cultivates the image of a
back-slapping Southern politician as he asks voters to re-elect him
to the U.S. Senate.
   But his Republican challenger is hoping to cut short Heflin's
Senate career with the same kind of upset that Democrat Richard
Shelby pulled off in Alabama in 1986 against Republican Sen.
Jeremiah Denton.
   ``Every poll shows us closing,'' says state Sen. Bill Cabaniss.
``The race is winnable.''
   Cabaniss has a lot of distance to close - polls put Heflin's
lead at about 3-1 this summer.
   His long-shot campaign is getting some high-level help.
President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, and federal drug czar
William Bennett have come to Alabama to campaign for him, and
former President Reagan is coming Saturday.
   Heflin, who at times plays the role of a country store humorist,
fills his campaign speeches with jokes about Republicans, or, as he
calls them, ``the Grey Poupon crowd, the Gucci-poochie-coochie
shoe-wearing, Mercedes-driving, polo-playing, jacuzzi-soaking,
Perrier-drinking, Aspen-skiing, ritzy rich, high-society
Republicans who eat broccoli.''
   Cabaniss does live in Mountain Brook, Birmingham's wealthiest
suburb, and was a director of Alabama's largest bank until he
resigned to prevent any conflict with his Senate bid. He also
belongs to an all-white country club, but he drives an
American-made car and has long worn plain support shoes.
   ``If that's all Heflin has to run on - personalities and
personal criticism - he has no business being a U.S. senator,''
Cabaniss said. ``I consider politics serious business.''
   Cabaniss, 52, has earned a reputation as being all business
during his four years in the Alabama House and eight in the state
Senate. His starched white shirt and short, slicked-back hair have
become trademarks of a man who explores the smallest details of
state budgets.
   Heflin, 69, resembles the stereotypical Southern politician with
his hefty frame, cream-colored suits, and warm personality. But his
work on the Senate Judiciary Committee has earned him a reputation
as a thoughtful questioner of presidential appointments and as one
who often casts the deciding vote.
   Heflin's Senate voting record shows him siding with the
Republican administration more than 70 percent of the time and
often being more loyal than some Republican senators, including
Quayle in 1988.
   But his crucial votes on the Judiciary Committee against Robert
Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court and U.S. Attorney Jeff
Sessions' nomination to a federal judgeship in Alabama have become
central issues in the campaign. Bork himself has campaigned on
Cabaniss' behalf.
   ``When you look at the votes that define a person's philosophy,
you are going to see Mr. Heflin lined up with Ted Kennedy and
Joseph Biden,'' Cabaniss said.
   Pat Cotter, a University of Alabama political scientist and
pollster, said Heflin's conservative voting record on economic and
social issues has left Cabaniss without the usual campaign issues
raised by Republicans.
   ``One indication of that is Cabaniss' use of the environmental
issue, which is not normally a Republican issue,'' Cotter said.
   Cabaniss spent a month paddling Alabama rivers during the summer
campaign. He has picked up endorsements from environmental groups,
including the Alabama Sierra Club, that were upset by Heflin votes
against stronger amendments to the Clean Air Act and to delay
legislation that would expand a federal wilderness area in north
Alabama.
   Heflin, who was first elected to the Senate in 1978, dismissed
the endorsements as coming from ``extremist groups.'' He said the
groups ignored many strong points in his environmental record,
including getting double liners installed at Alabama's giant
hazardous waste landfill.
   Last week, Cabaniss called on Heflin to resign as chairman of
the Senate Ethics Committee because he accepted a $2,000
contribution last year from a political action committee affiliated
with Sen. Aln Cranston, who is under investigation by the
committee for his intervention with bank regulators.
   Heflin said the donation was unsolicited and the name of the
donor, the National Committee for Democratic Consensus, gave no
indication it was tied to the California senator. After discovering
the donation's origin in July 1990, ``we returned it ... out of an
abundance of caution,'' Heflin said.
   Along with a lead in the polls, Heflin is running well ahead in
campaign funds. Financial reports on June 30 showed him with $2.7
million, compared to Cabaniss' $444,000.
   Cotter and Margaret Latimer, an Auburn University political
scientist specializing in Alabama politics, said Heflin appears to
have nothing to worry about.
   ``I perceive him to be very safe,'' Latimer said. ``I don't
think Cabaniss has brought up much he can hold against Heflin
except the environmental issue.''

<TEXT>
   A man accused of murdering two people in
a Billings coin shop is drawing the attention of law officers from
around the country and Canada who want to question him in similar
crimes.
   A man known to Montana authorities as Charles T. Sinclair was
arrested Aug. 13 in Alaska and is fighting extradition to Montana
to face murder charges for the Billings homicides.
   Alaska authorities say Sinclair is an alias for Jimmy Weir.
   Law officers from at least 15 different agencies will meet next
week in Billings to compare notes on a string of killings they
believe are related.
   Billings Police detective Sgt. Jerry Archer said Sinclair is a
suspect in at least 12 slayings, including the July 31 killings in
Billings.
   The conference will give investigators a chance to share
evidence and background information and to track Sinclair's
movements during the time the slayings occurred, Archer said.
   ``Basically, the idea is for the agencies to assist each other
in any way they can,'' Archer said. ``Some of the agencies have
information that only they are aware of.''
   Sinclair also has been charged with wounding a coin shop owner
in Murray, Utah, last May.
   Investigators want to question Sinclair in connection with the
killing coin shop workers in Everett, Wash., in January 1980;
Vacaville, Calif., in November 1986; Spokane, Wash., in July 1987;
Kansas City, Mo., in March 1988; Watertown, N.Y., in September
1989; and Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 19.
   Police in Houston and in Mishawaka, Ind., said Wednesday they
are investigating Sinclair for the slaying of coin shop workers in
their cities.

   Iraq has threatened to execute U.S. and other diplomats unless
they hand over Westerners they're sheltering, and an American
warship fired across the bow of an Iraqi tanker today to force it
to stop and submit to a search.
   The threat against the diplomats was contained in official
statements to the U.S., French and British embassies in Baghdad
Wednesday and today.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry today refused to comment on the
statement, but Iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity
said the memo only contained a reminder of an Iraqi law - issued
when Iraq annexed Kuwait last month - which stipulated that those
who provide refuge for foreigners could be punished by death. The
officials said the law applies only to Iraqis.
   The Iraqi statement, first disclosed by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III on Wednesday, was denounced by Western governments
today.
   In another development, three regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways
flights arrived in Amman today, and Jordanian officials insisted
such passenger flights do not violate the U.N. air embargo ordered
Tuesday by a 14-1 Security Council vote.
   About 485 people, mostly Asians and Arabs, arrived on the
flights from Baghdad.
   The U.N. resolution prohibited all flights carrying cargo in or
out of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. It also called on all states to
forbid the use of their airspace to any aircraft carrying non-mercy
cargo to the two countries.
   Officials in the United States and Britain also have said the
embargo does not ban passenger flights.
   The Pentagon said a team from a U.S. warship in the Red Sea
boarded the Iraqi tanker today after firing warning shots when
orders to stop were ignored.
   The tanker, the Tadmur, was allowed to proceed after it was
found to be empty, the Pentagon said. The U.S.S. Elmer Montgomery,
a frigate, fired bursts of .50 caliber machine gun fire across the
Tadmur's bow, the Pentagon said.
   A Coast Guard and Navy team then boarded the tanker, which was
heading south out of the Gulf of Aqaba into the northern Red Sea.
   More than 1,400 hundred ships have been intercepted since the
United Nations imposed an economic embargo on Iraq. More than 125
ships have been boarded, 110 of them by U.S. vessels and 15 by the
ships of other navies.
   At the United Nations today, the emir of Kuwait thanked the
world community for its support in his nation's fight against
Iraq's ``naked, brutal aggression'' in invading and occupying his
country. As Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah spoke to the General
Assembly, the Iraqi delegation stormed out.
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today unveiled a plan to
dispatch Japanese military personnel overseas for the first time
since World War II, but he said they would be unarmed and kept away
from combat.
   The proposal, which must be approved by the Japanese parliament,
calls for the establishment of a group of military and civilian
personnel to participate in U.N. peace-keeping activities.
   Kaifu acknowledged criticism that Japan is supplying little more
than money to the U.S.-led force deployed in the Middle East in
response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Kaifu is to travel Friday to
the United States, where some of the harshest criticism has been
voiced.
   Hurt by new and tougher trade sanctions, Iraq's leaders said
Wednesday they would cut off food to non-Arabs in their country.
They also announced they plan this weekend to extend nationwide
rationing to rice, flour, sugar, tea and cooking oil. Bread has
been rationed since Sept. 1.
   Before it invaded Kuwait and set in motion the retaliatory
international moves against it, Iraq was importing three-quarters
of its food.
   Diplomats in the Iraqi capital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that starting Monday, Iraq will halt food
rations to diplomatic missions in Baghdad for distribution to their
communitie.
   The envoys said they did not know how much foreigners would
suffer because most people had stockpiled basic foods. They said
that in September they received rations for distribution to their
communities. These included rice, flour, sugar, tea and cooking
oil.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -Algeria's former president, Ahmed Ben Bella, returning home
today after a decade in exile, urged tens of thousands of cheering
supporters to volunteer to fight in support of Iraq. He also called
on Algeria's government to resign.
   -Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned today that if Iraq
installs missiles in Sudan, Egypt would destroy them ``the
following day.'' But Mubarak, aboard a ship carrying his soldiers
to Saudi Arabia, denied reports that Iraq had set up
surface-to-surface missile bases in Sudan. ``If there were, we
would have hit,'' he said.
   -Spain today ordered four Iraqi diplomats to leave the country
within a week, its Foreign Ministry said. That was in retaliation
for Iraq's expulsion of Madrid's military attache and assistant
from Baghdad, the ministry said.
   The French said their embassy in Baghdad received the note today
from Iraqi authorities threatening the death penalty for anyone
harboring foreigners. It appeared to be the same note Baker said
was received a day earlier by the U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi
capital.
   Britain today rejected the Iraqi threat and said about 50
Britons are at its embassy in Baghdad. The Foreign Office said its
diplomats received the threatening note late Wednesday from the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
   Baker called threat ``repugnant,'' and a French Foreign Ministry
spokesman in Paris called the threat ``utterly intolerable.''
   The State Department quoted the text of the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry message as saying that ``that housing a foreigner for the
purpose of hiding him or her from the authorities is a crime of
espionage. The punishment of death shall be imposed on the
indiviudal who commits such a crime.
   ``The ministry will appreciate it if the esteemed mission would
kindly inform the ministry of whether any of its citizens or any
other nation's citizens are residing in the mission's embassies and
your diplomatic residences.''
   In Washington on Wednesday night, the Iraqi ambassador denied
the threat was made. ``We're not threatening anyone,'' Ambassador
Mohamed al-Mashat told reporters after a meeting at the State
Department. He refused further comment.
   Baker, in New York on Wednesday, rejected the Iraqi request for
the names of the people given sanctuary in the U.S. embassies in
Baghdad and Kuwait.
   About 300 to 350 U.S. citizens are stranded in Iraq, and 600 to
700 in Kuwait, according to figures released Monday by the State
Department. The United States has refused to discuss how many are
on U.S. embassy grounds.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that
Iraq had rounded up at least seven more Americans, bringing to
about 100 the number being detained.

   A heavily armed gunman invaded a
residential hotel and opened fire, killing one young man, wounding
seven and taking up to 30 hostages before police shot him to death
today.
   The man, described by witnesses as an Iranian in his 30s, was
shot when he ``got close enough to a window that we were able to
take him out,'' Berkeley Police Capt. Phil Doran said.
   ``He was apparently very confused,'' said Doran. ``Deranged is
not a bad description.''
   The gunman - identified by University of California at Berkeley
spokesman Ray Colvig as Mehrdad Dashti - was naked and bleeding
when he was put into an ambulance and taken to Highland Hospital.
He was dead on arrival, hospital spokeswomen Phyllis Brown said.
   Police would not confirm the identification.
   Police Lt. Jim Polk, field commander at the scene, said he
ordered six heavily armed officers to storm the hotel bar after
veteran police negotiators concluded there was ``no other way'' to
resolve the standoff.
   The gunman, who had been drinking beer all night, would
``alternate between hyper and coming down,'' said Polk. ``It was
felt that if we let it go much longer, he might go off and start
shooting people.''
   A young man and his girlfriend, who had been hostages in the
besieged Durant Hotel, appeared red-eyed and upset as they were
hustled into a nearby building by authorities. Both declined to
give their names.
   ``You can't believe something like that can happen,'' the young
man said.
   ``It was like living in a dream but it's over now,'' his
companion added.
   Doran offered no clear motive for the attack.
   ``We really don't know, except that he is apparently upset
because he didn't get a student loan,'' he said.
   The gunman was apparently hit by a burst of gunfire heard around
7:20 a.m. Seconds later, hostages, some of whom had been forced to
sit in the windows of Henry's Bar in the hotel as human shields,
began to run from the hotel.
   The standoff began shortly after midnight, when the man, armed
with a half-dozen weapons including handguns and rifles, stormed
in.
   Officials at the University of California, Berkeley campus, just
a block from the beseiged hotel, said classes would be held as
scheduled. Counselors were available to help those traumatized by
the ordeal.
   The gunman shot six people after entering the Durant Hotel,
Doran said. Police reported two other people were shot during
another round of gunfire about 3:15 a.m. in Henry's Bar and Grill
on the hotel's second floor.
   Witnesses said the shooting was punctuated by the gunman
screaming: ``When is it going to end? How long? How long?''
   Doran said one hostage escaped at the onset of the second
shooting spree and did not require medical attention.
   The gunman, who periodically sent hostages outside with messages
for police, threatened to execute a hostage if authorities did not
turn off outside lights. But those hostages were not freed and were
ordered to return.
   He also closed the drapes and rearranged furniture, police said.
   John Sheehy, 22, died at 2:35 a.m. of a gunshot wound to the
chest during surgery at Eden Hospital in Castro Valley, said
hospital spokesman Thomas McGarry.
   Graduate student Chris Hobbes, 20, was in fair condition with a
gunshot wound to the leg, said McGarry. Hobbes was scheduled for
surgery this morning.
   The English pub-style bar was crowded with about 35 to 40
students when the gunman rushed inside, witnesses said. About 20
were able to flee periodically during the confusion, witnesses
said.
   One escaped hostage, who gave her name only as Rebecca, told a
local television reporter that the gunman instructed all the blonde
women in the hotel to ``take off your pants.''
   Another woman who managed to flee said the gunman then ``had
them do something sexually perverse,'' but she did not elaborate.
   A bar patron who escaped after about 20 minutes in the bar said
the gunman initially fired blanks, then injured a hostage. Sheeye
apparently was killed before the threat to execute the hostages was
made, officials said.
   Police Sgt. Ron Barela was grazed by a bullet when he arrived at
the scene, Doran said. Barela was treated at a hospital and
released.
   A 23-year-old male and a 22-year-old female were listed in
guarded condition at Highland Hospital in Oakland with multiple
gunshot wounds, hospital spokeswoman Brown said.
   Alta Bates Hospital spokeswoman Gail Radzevich said a
26-year-old female and a 21-year-old male were treated for gunshot
wounds to the arm and released.
   A 22-year-old woman who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg was
transferred from Alta Bates to Kaiser Permanente in Oakland,
Radzevich said.
   During the standoff, officers kept onlookers two blocks from the
hotel. Residents in the immediate vicinity were not evacuated, but
asked to stay away from windows.
   ``You have to get back. You have to get back. He just shot
another one,'' an officer told about 30 people gathered at police
lines after 2 a.m.
   Steve Cahn, a 20-year-old sophomore, was not permitted by police
to return to his house across the street from the hotel.
   ``We just went out to do our laundry and we come back and we
can't even get back on the block,'' Cahn said.

<HEAD>Coroner's Body Mix-up Erupts in Funeral Furor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bodies were switched at the medical
examiner's office, and the mix-up went undetected until relatives
went to a funeral home and saw a stranger in the casket.
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said Velma Romeo, who had expected to
see the body of her balding, 76-year-old husband, Anthony. ``When I
came up to view the casket, I saw a man with a full head of hair.
He was dressed in my husband's clothes and he had on my husband's
glasses.''
   The body was that of a 53-year-old Tampa man who died of cancer
on Sept. 17, the same day Romeo died of heart disease at his home
in suburban Seffner. Romeo's body was later found in the
Hillsborough County morgue.
   ``We're very, very sorry that it happened,'' said Betty Buchan,
interim director of the county Medical Examiner's Office. ``We're
very sorry for the emotional trauma the family went through. We're
still trying to figure out what went wrong.''
   It is the second mix-up involving the medical examiner's office
in four months. Last June, the office sent the wrong body to a
crematorium.
   Mrs. Romeo said that when her husband died she asked that his
body be taken directly to the funeral home. It was not clear why
the body was taken to the medical examiner's office.
   The next day, a private courier picked up a body and took it to
the specified funeral home.
   ``My grandson just flipped out,'' Mrs. Romeo said. ``He blew his
stack. He said, That's not my grandfather!' They said, `Are you
sure?' and I said, `Where's my husband?' ''
   ``I had my whole family with me,'' she said. ``One girl fainted,
another one was screaming.''
   Mrs. Romeo said the funeral was postponed a day.

<HEAD>NASA's `Cannibalization' of Parts Picks Up Speed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stalled shuttle program has
prevented NASA from ending the scorned practice of
``cannibalizing'' spaceship parts.
   Discovery, due to lift off Oct. 6 with a satellite to study the
sun, received an auxiliary power unit and a metal grounding strap
from Atlantis in August. Atlantis was grounded by leaking hydrogen
fuel in June, a month after Columbia's hydrogen leaks were
detected.
   Atlantis, in turn, got an auxiliary power unit this week that
was removed from Columbia. Atlantis is due to fly around Nov. 7,
four months later than planned.
   ``We're concerned because every time you remove a part from one
orbiter and put it into another orbiter, you get two chances to
introduce a problem - when you took it out of the one and when you
put it in the other,'' said William Lenoir, head of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's space flight program.
   The problem is that NASA has eight serviceable auxiliary power
units, but needs nine - three for each shuttle. The units
pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic system.
   ``If I don't have one on my `spares shelf' in stock, then I
either don't fly or I have to go get one from another orbiter.
Unfortunately, that's where we've found ourselves recently,''
Lenoir said Wednesday.
   The presidential commission that investigated the Challenger
explosion recommended that NASA stop removing parts from one
shuttle to supply another. NASA was forced into the situation
because of an increasing flight rate and an insufficient supply of
spare parts, the commission concluded.
   When Challenger lifted off for the last time on Jan. 28, 1986,
it had 25 ``cannibalized'' parts, none of which are believed to
have contributed to the disaster.
   The number of swapped parts per flight is going down. It has not
exceeded 10 in the past two years, NASA figures show. The last
shuttle flight, in fact, had no borrowed parts and the three before
that each had only one.
   Since the last shuttle flight in April, NASA also has replaced
Columbia's leaky hydrogen fuel line assembly with one from
Endeavour, the shuttle under construction in California.
   ``It's hard from a logistics standpoint to try to keep three
vehicles (outfitted), any one of which you're trying to launch,''
said Roger Enlow, logistics director and overseer of the 220,000
shuttle parts.
   ``If you had had the first flight go when the first flight was
supposed to, you would have had them (parts) in the right ones,''
said Ann Montgomery, deputy director of logistics.
   Of the 220,000 parts that make up each shuttle, about 55,000 are
stocked at Kennedy Space Center. There is not enough room and money
to stock more, Montgomery said. Besides, some components need to be
replaced so infrequently it would be impractical to keep extras on
hand, she said.
   Although more spares are available now - one of the many changes
resulting from the 1986 Challenger accident - there never can be
enough, Enlow said.
   ``Cannibalization can never totally be avoided. There's just not
enough money to do that,'' Enlow said.
   The current logistics budget totals $193 million. NASA is
seeking $210 million for fiscal 1991, which begins Monday.
   The last time NASA had an extra auxiliary power unit, or APU,
was in July. Another is expected in November from the manufacturer,
Sundstrand Corp. of Rockford, Ill., but NASA officials are
uncertain whether it, like many of late, will be unusable because
of cracked valve seats.
   NASA is reluctant to order more APUs - at $2 million each -
since an upgraded model is due out early next year.
   Formal approval from about a dozen NASA officials is necessary
before parts can be swapped. The board is much less prone to grant
such sanctions than it was before Challenger's seven crew members
were killed, said Jay Greene, deputy manager of the shuttle program
office at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   David Acheson said he and others on the presidential commission
opposed the practice because of the ``degree of uncertainty''
introduced each time a part is swapped.
   ``If you multiply those uncertainties, however small they may
appear individually, you are necessarily increasing the risk of
some maladjustment or some slight injury to a component or some
little glitch in the assembly,'' said Acheson, executive director
of George Washington University's Institute for Technology and
Strategic Research.
   NASA recently learned the risk of tampering with installed
components. While searching for contamination in Columbia's engine
compartment following the shuttle's January flight, workers
apparently crushed a seal on a valve, which contributed to the
hydrogen leak. More such damage is feared.

<HEAD>Pat Robertson Attacks Arts Endowment for `Oral Sex' Puppet Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Pat Robertson charged Thursday that
a children's puppet show featuring simulated oral sex was performed
last week at an Atlanta arts festival allegedly subsidized by the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Robertson's claims were vigorously denied by the NEA, the
Georgia state arts council and puppeteer Jon Ludwig of Atlanta.
   ``This is just the latest example of the continual distortion of
fact by the arts endowment's most virulent critics, those intent on
eliminating the agency at any cost, even that of the truth,'' said
chief NEA spokesman Jack Lichtenstein.
   Robertson said the puppet show, performed at the Atlanta Arts
Festival last Friday before 800 people, including children,
featured ``approximately five minutes of simulated foreplay between
two puppets followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts.''
   Robertson, a 1988 presidential candidate, said his Christian
Coalition in Chesapeake, Va., responded by generating 27,000
petitions demanding that the NEA be abolished and sending them
Tuesday to every member of Congress.
   ``The Atlanta Arts Festival is supposed to be a family affair,''
Robertson said in a statement. ``If the weirdos on the federal dole
do not stop peddling obscenity and pornography, members of Congress
will hear from angry voters in November.''
   Robertson said 8 percent of the festival's $760,000 budget came
from public sources, including NEA money funneled through the
Georgia Council on the Arts, a state government agency.
   But Lichtenstein and Frank Ratka, the council's execttive
director, denied that any NEA funds went to the festival. Ratka
said the council gave the festival $33,500 in state funds only this
year.
   The Lichtenstein, Ratka and Patrician Gann, executive director
of the Atlanta festival, said the puppet show was financed entirely
by earned income - such as ticket sales and concessions - and
received neither federal nor state funds.
   Ludwig, artistic director of the Center for Puppetry Arts in
Atlanta who wrote and directed the festival puppet show, denied
that it contained simulated oral sex. He characterized it as a
``morality play'' intended only for adult audiences.
   The show was titled ``Zeitgeist'' or ``The Spirit of Our Times:
the Spirit That Always Denies'' and contained a 60-second scene in
which a demon used the bottom half of a female mannequin to lure
the play's artist hero.
   ``This was a scene about temptation,'' Ludwig said. ``It was
intended to be satirical. After all, what literally happened is
that two pieces of plastic rubbed against each other.''
   ``The intent was to satirize all the lust and all this hoo-haw
over lust in our society,'' he said. `It was not simulated oral
sex. It's impossible. How can puppets do that? They don't even have
the parts. It was like finding children playing with Ken and Barbie
dolls in the back room and calling Pat Robertson.''
   Ludwig said the puppet show got a standing ovation from the
audience, a rave review in the local press and only one complaint,
which Ms. Gann said came from a Marietta, Ga., clergyman.
   Ms. Gann said the festival theater stage was fenced off from
general view because of the adult nature of evening performances.
About a half-dozen children were among the audience of 800 people
at the puppet show, despite warning signs and pre-performance
announcements to parents that the material was unsuitable for
children, she said.
   Robertson's latest attack on the NEA came as House members
braced for an emotional floor battle over legislative proposals to
extend the endowment's life past Sunday, when its statutory
authority expires.
   Plans to begin floor debate late this week were scrapped, partly
to give House negotiators more time to draft a compromise bill
aimed at satisfying conservative lawmakers' demands for assurances
that the NEA won't spend federal funds on obscene or blasphemous
art.
   The debate was expected to begin sometime next week.
   Robertson said that in addition to flooding congressional
offices with petitions demanding a fund cutoff for the NEA, the
Christian Coalition is distributing literature and photographs from
a controversial exhibit of works by photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe to ``the districts of wavering members of Congress''
in several states.
   Conservative criticism of an NEA grant underwriting the
Mapplethorpe exhibit prompted Congress to approve a ban last fall
on federal support for works that ``may be considered obscene,''
including depictions of homoeroticism and sadomasochism and sexual
exploitation of children.

<TEXT>
   A state investigation has cleared Covenant
House, the home for runaway children, of any criminal charges in
its handling of charitable contributions, a spokesman for the state
attorney general said Thursday.
   The state and officials at the shelter once run by the Rev.
Bruce Ritter were negotiating changes in financial procedures to
prevent any future problems, said Ed Barbini, spokesman for state
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   ``There are some questionable transactions we are talking to
them about,'' said Barbini. ``We hope Covenant House will accede to
our requests, and make the reforms.''
   Covenant House came under fire when allegations of Ritter's
sexual liaisons with runaway boys were made public. Ritter, a Roman
Catholic priest, denied the charges but resigned his position.
   Barbini and Covenant House spokesman Robert McGrath said the
organization has implemented 25 of the 30 recommendations made by
Abrams' office. The rest should be in place shortly, said Barbini.
   Among those recommendations were the severing of all ties with
Ritter and establishment of a more powerful board of directors.
   A remaining issue is Abrams' demand that the shelter make
periodic financial reports to the state, said Barbini.

   A decoy doesn't count as wildlife, a
judge said as he reversed the convictions of two hunters who were
bagged by state game officers for shooting at a stuffed deer.
   Aaron J. Stiffey Sr., 46, of Bolivar, and James Wagner, 31, of
New Florence, were arrested Dec. 7, 1989, during buck-hunting
season.
   They were charged with shooting at the decoy from a vehicle on a
public road, not wearing proper hunting garb or having their
hunting licenses, and having loaded firearms in their pickup truck.
   Wildlife officers testified that the decoy, nicknamed ``Officer
Buck,'' was shot twice and that they saw Stiffey fire one of the
shots. And they said that when Stiffey was cited, he remarked: ``I
guess you got me.''

on Wednesday ruled on appeal that there was no evidence against
Wagner. And he overturned Stiffey's conviction because the stuffed
deer was not alive and did not meet the state definition of
wildlife.
   Assistant District Attorney Patrick Noonan said the use of the
stuffed five-point buck was not entrapment, as the men had argued.
   ``The use of this decoy is no different than an undercover
policemen soliciting for prostitution,'' he said.
   Stiffey had been fined $648.50 and Wagner was fined $548.50
after they were convicted by a magistrate.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Issues First Order Under New Economic Powers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began using his
sweeping new powers to rescue the collapsing Soviet economy on
Thursday, ordering businesses to fulfill supply contracts and the
government to ensure distribution.
   But it was far from clear that people would comply with his
order. Many are uncertain how they will fit in the market economy
Gorbachev is trying to establish and they find it more profitable
to trade goods on the black market, rather than distribute them in
the established structure.
   A Western specialist called the order ``a waste of time.''
   In his first decree since the Supreme Soviet legislature on
Monday granted him new powers to shore up the economy and maintain
law and order, Gorbachev said told government businesses,
``regardless of their administrative subordination and location,''
to preserve economic ties. He said the businesses should meet all
contract obligations for raw materials and other goods in the last
quarter of this year and throughout 1991.
   It is during that period that the country will be trying to
switch from a centrally planned to a market economy under a plan
the Supreme Soviet is to select after Oct. 15.
   Gorbachev's decree, read on the nightly TV newscast ``Vremya''
and released by the Tass news agency, was an attempt to preserve
the status quo at a time when many businesses are trying to bypass
Moscow and trade directly with each other.
   The restive republics, for instance, have been signing economic
cooperation agreements in a preliminary step toward a common
market. That leaves the Moscow ministries - which since the 1920s
have issued five-year plans that told thousands of factories, farms
and businesses what to produce, where to sell it and how much to
charge - out of the picture.
   Gorbachev said it was ``impermissible'' that managers had
disrupted economic ties and referred to ``the extraordinary nature
of the situation.''
   In a harkening back to Bolshevik appeals to the proletariat,
Gorbachev urged workers to join their bosses in making sure
contracts are kept. He also said the Council of Ministers, the
Soviet Cabinet, should if necessary ``introduce a special regime
for the operation of railways and other all-state life-sustaining
systems of the country.''
   Bottlenecks in railroad deliveries, in part caused by a shortage
of railroad cars, have reportedly disrupted the distribution of
food and other goods nationwide. Soviets face shortages of housing,
food and consumer goods, and the government daily Izvestia on
Thursday warned that power failures are possible this winter
because fuel reserves are running low and two-thirds of power
equipment is worn out and unreliable.
   Jan Vanous, director of the economics research firm PlanEcon,
called Gorbachev's decree ``misdirected.''
   ``What the Soviets need is price liberalization,'' Vanous said
in a telephone interview from his Washington office. ``Passing some
decree on relations between enterprises is a waste of time.''
   Several proposals before the Supreme Soviet legislature would
free prices of goods, now set by the government. The most radical
blueprint, written by economist Stanislav Shatalin, calls for
junking the central planning system and moving to a market economy
within 500 days by selling factories to private owners and breaking
up collective farms.
   Gorbachev had said he would not wait for the economic rescue
plan to be approved before issuing decrees to stablize the economy.
But Vanous said Gorbachev is making a mistake.
   ``What is needed for stabilization is destabilization. Unleash
market forces and let the economy take a deep plunge, then it
stabilizes,'' he said.
   Several statistics point to a breakdown of the system.
   Interior Ministry officials said investigators have found
corruption at half the 160,000 businesses they inspected this year
and incidents of serious embezzlement are running at twice last
year's level.
   From January through June, the Gross National Product dropped 1
percent and labor productivity fell 1.5 percent, government reports
have said. At the same time, the government printed 9 percent more
rubles and the average wage for industrial and service workers shot
up.

   The latest Republican proposal for breaking
the deadlock over deficit reduction would give President Bush the
capital-gains tax cut he demands. Only the method would be
different.
   Instead of excluding a flat 30 percent of long-term capital
gains from taxation, as the president proposes, the new plan would
exclude an amount that would vary with the inflation rate.
   Backers of a capital-gains cut say the new proposal, called
indexing, would increase incentives for investment, although in the
short run the ``punch'' might not be as strong as under Bush's
plan. Opponents, who have shown no sign of endorsing the new
proposal, say it has the same flaw as its predecessor: the lion's
share of the tax cut would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a
year.
   ``It's still a capital-gains cut,'' Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee, an opponent of a reduction,
said after the indexing proposal was offered to deficit negotiators
earlier in the week.
   Indexing is designed to prevent taxation of capital gains that
result only from inflation.
   Present law taxes capital gains - which are profits from the
sale of investments - at the same rates applying to wages and other
income: 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent.
   Assume, for example, that a piece of real estate was bought in
1983 for $50,000 and sold in 1990 for $100,000. Under present law,
the $50,000 profit would be taxed fully; a person in the 28 percent
bracket would pay $14,000.
   Under Bush's original plan, 30 percent of the $50,000 - or
$15,000 - would be excluded from taxation, resulting in a tax of
$9,800 for a person in the 28 percent bracket.
   Because consumer prices have risen about 25 percent since 1983,
one-quarter of the $50,000 profit is illusory; that portion has not
increased the seller's purchasing power at all.
   Under a proposal for fully indexing against inflation, that 25
percent would not be taxed, leaving the seller in the 28 percent
bracket with a tax bill of $10,500 instead of $14,000.
   Sellers of long-held property might be better off with indexing
than under Bush's original plan. In other cases, a flat exclusion
would be more profitable.
   Details of the indexing proposal being considered by the
negotiators have not been made public, leaving key questions
unanswered. Would investors be protected fully against inflation
or, perhaps, only against inflation above 2 percent or 3 percent a
year? Would capital losses caused solely by inflation by
deductible?
   Before 1986, only 40 percent of gains were taxed. With a maximum
income-tax rate of 50 percent, that had the effect of a top
capital-gains tax rate of 20 percent.
   If Bush's original proposal for a 30 percent exclusion were to
become law, the richest Americans, who pay a maximum income-tax
rate of 28 percent, would pay 19.6 percent on capital gains.
However, some upper-middle-income people, who face a top rate of 33
percent, would pay a top capital-gains rate of 23.1 percent.
   Past attempts to index capital gains have prompted protests that
this would discriminate against other investors, whose money is in
savings accounts or other investments that also are hurt by
inflation.

   A former U.S. foreign aid official was
sentenced Thursday to nine months in prison for accepting $11,130
from a medical consultant who was awarded contracts for
public-health assistance programs.
   John Massey, who was also fined $2,000 by U.S. District Judge
George Revercomb, was the last of three defendants who received
prison terms for corrupting the award of contracts for aid projects
in Central America.
   Earlier this year, the No. 2 official who supervised
humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan Contras was given a 12-month
sentence by another federal judge.
   That official, Donald F. Enos, the former deputy director of the
agency's task force for humanitarian assistance to Central America,
pleaded guilty to accepting nearly $100,000 in bribes from medical
consultant George F. Kraus.
   A firm owned by Kraus, who began cooperating with investigators
after he was videotaped paying a $3,000 bribe to an undercover
operative, once had $3.5 million worth of consulting contracts with
AID, officials said.
   Revercomb sentenced Kraus on Sept. 11 to eight months in prison
and fined him $6,000 for bribing the undercover operative of the
AID inspector general's office.
   Massey's sentencing Thursday came on his guilty plea to
conspiring to defraud the government, a charge that carried a
maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.
   The AID project officer in Guatemala City, Guatemala, from 1987
to 1989, Massey, 51, admitted receiving the money during a time
when he was giving Kraus inside information about contracts the
agency was preparing to put out for bids. Massey also admitted
helping Kraus write bid proposal documents.
   Defense attorney Howard Katzoff sought leniency for his client,
noting that Massey was recently divorced and a recovering alcoholic
when he first met Kraus in 1987.
   Katzoff argued that while Massey had some influence over how the
contracts were awarded, he did not control the process.
   But Justice Department prosecutor David Green said that Massey
held ``a position of trust and he abused that trust.''
   ``This kind of government corruption calls for some period of
incarceration as the only way to send the message that this type of
conduct is totally intolerable in our system,'' Green argued.

   The National Enquirer isn't backing down from
its stories portraying Elizabeth Taylor as a heavy drinker, the
tabloid newspaper's editor said after the actress filed a $20
million libel lawsuit.
   ``All I can really say is we stand by our story, which we
investigated very thoroughly,'' Iain Calder, president and editor
of the Florida-based supermarket tabloid, said Wednesday.
   Citing the advice of the newspaper's attorneys, Calder said he
could not discuss the suit in detail.
   The Superior Court lawsuit filed Tuesday said the actress was
hospitalized with near-fatal pneumonia when a front-page headline
June 12 screamed: ``Liz Docs Furious. She's Boozing It Up in the
Hospital.''
   The inside headline read: ``While Doctors Battle to Save her
Life ... Liz Boozes It Up In The Hospital.''
   The complaint alleges that the Enquirer was notified about
inaccuracies in its stories and headlines four days before
publication.
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
with a persistent fever and sinus infection. Her condition worsened
and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's Hospital and Health
Center, where she battled and overcame pneumonia.
   In 1983, the actress acknowledged a 35-year addiction to
sleeping pills and pain killers. She has been treated for alcohol
and drug abuse.

   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Singer Ann Wilson, whose latest hit with
her band Heart describes picking up a hitchhiker and getting
pregnant from a one-night stand, says she's adopting a child o her
own, a newspaper reported.
   Wilson says she's going to adopt a child that is to be born in
late February, USA Today reported Thursday.
   ``I have a lot to give a child, and this has the overwhelming
support of my family,'' said Wilson, who is not married.
   Wilson said she decided to reveal her adoption plans when she
heard a national tabloid was going to do a story on it.
   ``When my child grows up, I don't want him or her ever to have
to question the facts behind the adoption,'' Wilson said.
   Ann Wilson and her sister Nancy said they think their latest
hit, ``All I Want to Do Is Make Love to You,'' is pure romantic
fantasy.
   The song, from the Seattle band's album ``Brigade,'' tells of
two lonely people meeting on a rainy highway. They spend the night
together and later the woman bears the hitchhiker's child. But
their relationship is never fully realized because the woman is
involved with another man.
   The tune climbed to No. 2 on Billboard's Top 100 this summer.

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Was Rue McClanahan, the actress who plays
Blanche Devereaux on the TV series ``The Golden Girls,''
considering an appearance on ``L.A. Law?''
   No, McClanahan said she was just a curious spectator when she
made an appearance at the Wake County Courthouse on Wednesday.
   During a court break, Miss McClanahan said she was in Raleigh
for a few days to visit friends. One friend, David H. Rogers, was
defending a client in a trial and she wanted to hear the case.
   ``I'd never been in a courtroom before,'' she said. ``I wanted
to go someplace where I wouldn't be noticed.''
   But the courthouse was the wrong place for that.
   As word spread, prosecutors, clerks and law-enforcement officers
asked for autographs. The actress complied graciously.
   One of them was Ron Rawlings, a Highway Patrol trooper, who
handed her a business card and told her his name. ``I'm a die-hard
fan of hers; she's hot,'' the trooper said.

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Former President Carter and West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher were named recipients of
the 1991 Onassis Foundation awards Thursday.
   Two other awards will go to Greenpeace International and
prominent Cypriot archaeologist Professor Vassos Karagiorgis.
   The awards were announced by Ioannis Georgakis, president of the
Lichenstein-based foundation, established under the will of the
late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.
   The foundation honors the memory of Onassis' 23-year-old son,
Alexander, killed in an airplane crash at Athens Airport in 1973.
   The prizes are accompanied by $100,000 each and will be
presented at a ceremony in Athens in April.
   Georgakis said Carter was chosen for his international
peace-keeping efforts and for establishing the Carter Presidential
Center in Atlanta to support education, human rights and
humanitarian activities.
   He said Genscher would receive the Athinai prize for being a
``decisive factor in the shaping of today's East-West relations,
part of which is the unification of Germany.''

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson's
condition has been improving after being hospitalized for bleeding
around his brain, officials said.
   Benson was listed in fair and stable condition Thursday at LDS
Hospital. The 91-year-old church leader was ``sitting up, talking
with visitors'' a church spokesman said Wednesday.
   A brain scan on Tuesday showed no new bleeding, and Benson was
``showing some signs of improvement,'' said spokesman Don LeFevre.
``He's sitting up today. That's something he hasn't done since last
week.''
   Benson was admitted to the hospital Sept. 18, complaining of
headaches and difficulty swallowing. He underwent surgery the
following day to remove clots from both sides of the head.
   A second operation was performed Sunday to remove a
reaccumulation of blood on the left side of the head.
   Benson became president of the 7.5 million-member Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1985.

   Some kids don't need lunch money
anymore. And, no, there's no free lunch for them.
   Instead, several elementary schools have introduced a plastic
``credit card'' for those who have a habit of losing lunch money or
spending it on something else.
   ``You hand 'em your card, and whoosh! they put it through the
machine,'' Danny Vigil, a third-grader at Rancho Las Positas
Elementary School, said Tuesday. ``It saves time. We go out on the
playground.''
   Unlike regular credit cards, parents pay lump sums in advance
for these plastic accounts. Card purchases are then deducted from
individual accounts. Schools in Livermore, San Jose, Dublin,
Antioch, Vallejo and Fairfield recently joined schools around the
country, including those in Philadelphia and Fort Worth, Texas, in
using plastic lunch money.
   Officials for card manufacturing companies say some schools have
had the cards for as long as five years.
   ``We have technology in our lives, and now, so do children,''
said Chip Goodman, president of School Nutrition Accountability
Systems Co. of Santa Monica. Goodman said his business makes cards
for about 100 school districts around the nation.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has waged an
elaborate, secret campaign for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize,
according to internal documents and former officials of the
business group.
   The business federation, which nicknamed its campaign ``Special
Project,'' courted U.S. lawmakers, world leaders and a former
prize-winner to get itself nominated for the award, the documents
show. It hired an editor to research and prepare a narrative of the
chamber's overseas activities.
   The award, worth $653,000 this year, will be announced on Oct.
15 in Oslo, Norway.
   Candidates may be nominated by previous laureates, members of
parliaments or political science faculty members of selected
universities. The chamber's pitch was that it has helped bring
democracy and a free enterprise economy to Eastern Europe and Third
World countries.
   Nominations closed on Feb. 1. The chamber was nominated by David
A. Morse, a New York attorney who was director general of the
International Labor Organization, which won the prize in 1969; and
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   ``I'd be embarrassed if I were promoting myself that much,''
said Barry King, the organization's media relations director until
June. ``It seems to me the people who have won it didn't need to
toot their own horn so much.''
   But Milt Mitler, chamber vice president for public liaison, said
Wednesday, ``It was not a campaign. We were nominated for the prize
by Sen. Lugar and Mr. Morse. We had to give them both historic
information on what the chamber does or has done.''
   Being nominated ``is a feather in our cap,'' Mitler said.
   Last year, the chamber drafted a nominating letter that said it
``richly deserves international recognition for its bold and
visionary leadership in the cause of human freedom, which is a
prerequisite to world peace.'' The nominating process is secret,
and it is uncertain whether Morse or Lugar used the letter.
   The campaign was the chamber's ``secret project. They were
consumed by it during a three-month period,'' said King, who
resigned from the chamber to become a private consultant in
Atlanta. Details of the campaign were also provided by a second
former chamber official, on condition of anonymity.
   However, Mitler said, ``How could we push ourself? You can't
contact the committee. We did not go out and canvass people, we did
not advertise.''
   Last year's winner was the Dalai Lama, Tibet's religious and
political leader. Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and India's
Mother Teresa also are recent winners.
   Rep. Lee Hamilon, D-Ind., declined a request by chamber
President Richard Lesher and other chamber officials to nominate
the business group. Hamilton told Lesher ``that he just could not
nominate because it would be inappropriate,'' according to a
chamber-prepared chronology that chronicled the campaign from
September 1989 through last January.
   In December 1989, Hamilton had been visited by Lesher, Mitler
and other chamber officials, and presented a document about the
business group and a proposed nominating letter. Hamilton, who
declined comment this week, said at the time that he ``doesn't
think he has the clout in Norwayto make a difference,'' according
to a chamber outline of the meeting.
   The chamber devoted time ``to gathering information on the award
from various sources including the committee in Norway,
strategizing on how best to secure nominator support and making the
appropriate contacts,'' its chronology said.
   The chamber is a federation of 180,000 businesses, trade and
professional associations and satellite chambers in the 50 states
and overseas. Members pay dues, and receive publications and a
voice in chamber programs and lobbying.
   According to the chronology, the chamber's original list of
potential nominators included former President Reagan, Turkish
President Turgut Ozal, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Oscar
Arias, the former Costa Rican president and a Nobel winner. Before
narrowing the list, the chamber assigned officials to try to win
nominations from each leader, as well as from Morse and Lugar.
   The Nobel selection committee, whose members are elected by the
Norwegian Parliament, says it is not swayed by lobbyists or by
thousands of letters promoting favorites among candidates.
   Norwegian news reports said this year's nominees include Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, and Czechoslovakia's President Vaclav
Havel and former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek.

   From Independence Hall to Yosemite National
Park, America's best known landmarks are already feeling the sting
of the federal budget crisis.
   The roof at Independence Hall leaks. Yosemite had to scale back
its 100th birthday party. And a Texas memorial had to cancel a
popular folk festival for the first time in 18 years.
   Things could get worse.
   The cash crunch threatens to make the Washington Monument into a
massive symbol not only of America's first president, but of a
government unable to operate its historic treasures.
   Absent a congressional budget agreement before Monday, the
monument would have to close on the two days producing the least
number of visitors - probably Mondays and Tuesdays, the National
Park Service said Thursday.
   For years, the park service has been accused of ``gamesmanship''
by threatening to close such a visible and popular monument, said
park service spokesman Duncan Morrow.
   ``The Washington Monument has been the great symbol of the
budget game for several years. But under the basic rules of
Gramm-Rudman (the budget deficit law), each park is a separate item
that has to get the same degree of cut,'' Morrow said
   The Statue of Liberty would also shut down two days a week, the
park service said.
   Budgets are already lean at national parks and monuments. But
administrators are preparing for the possibility that the president
may have to order automatic spending cuts Monday, the first day of
the government's 1991 fiscal year.
   That would force most government agencies, including the park
service, to trim expenses by 32.4 percent.
   Already, Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park
has announced the indefinite closing of the Second Bank of the
United States, the Marine Corps Museum, the Army-Navy Museum and
Old City Hall.
   The park's most popular attractions - the Liberty Bell and
Independence Hall - remain open. But Independence Hall's roof is in
disrepair, prompting an urgent plea from Rep. Thomas Foglietta,
D-Pa., not to allow ``a vital part of this country's history'' to
``slide into ruin.''
   Provisions of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit law
require the park service to impose reductions evenhandedly on its
nearly 600 parks, programs and activities. Parks could choose to
absorb the cuts in different ways.
   At Grand Canyon National Park, the 32.4 percent cut would
probably mean reductions in the number of seasonal staff, said
spokesman Chuck Lundy. That could jeopardize operation of the park
entrance stations, which collect $5 fees from motorists.
   In Hawaii, the USS Arizona memorial to Americans killed at Pearl
Harbor would close one or two days a week, said chief ranger Gary
Warshefski.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan would be unable to attend
Yosemite's long-planned 100th anniversary celebration, scheduled
for next week.
   ``How can you justify to a furloughed worker the price of a
plane ticket to fly across the country for a ceremony?'' Morrow
asked.
   Administrators of the Chamizal National Memorial in El Paso,
Texas, canceled next week's $70,000 music and dance festival
celebrating a bridge of U.S. and Latin American cultures. The
memorial marks the settlement of an American-Mexican border
dispute.
   ``It's sort of a heartbreaker to everybody. After 17 years, we
were starting to think we were secure,'' said memorial
Superintendent Frank Smith.

   The World Bank signalled for the first time
Thursday that it may not have sufficient resources to handle the
economic shocks resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis without
appealing to rich countries for extra donations.
   Officials of both the World Bank and its sister lending
organization, the International Monetary Fund, expressed worries
about the possibility that the turmoil in the Mideast could result
in a global recession.
   But the two institutions continued to insist that such a
calamity could be avoided with sensible policies to control the
inflation expected to result from the doubling of oil prices since
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We face the risks of recession and higher inflation. It is
time for a steady response. We need to maintain confidence,'' IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus said at the close of the 45th
annual meetings of the two institutions.
   ``Countries will suffer from the gulf crisis, but this is
manageable as long as (debtor nations) follow good policies and the
international support matches the efforts of the countries
themselves,'' Camdessus said.
   World Bank President Barber Conable said that if oil prices
remain at current high levels over the next three months, then his
institution would likely not have sufficient resources to cushion
the impact on developing countries.
   He said that if that proves to be the case he would seek
approval from the countries that make up the bank's board of
directors to establish a special fund for voluntary contributions
from oil-rich nations and others.
   The money would be used to provide no-interest loans to nations
having the greatest difficulty coping with the jump in oil prices
and other economic fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Conable did not mention any possible candidates for such aid.
But a World Bank report earlier in the week singled out 10
countries whose economies stood to suffer the most from the Iraqi
invasion.
   The list included Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, the nations the Bush
administration has been focusing its fund-raising effort on in a
belief that without significant aid the resolve of these nations to
support the campaign against Saddam Hussein could crumble.
   The World Bank report also listed Morocco, Bangladesh, India,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Sudan as countries that
would be seriously affected from such factors as higher oil prices,
loss of export markets and returning refugees.
   ``If the price of oil stays up and there continues to be turmoil
and uncertainty and an impact on the global economy, clearly it
will have a major impact on significant parts of the developing
world,'' Conable told reporters.
   His comments Thursday represented a change from an earlier
stance that the World Bank did not need to create programs and
could handle the crisis with existing resources.
   In part, the change of view reflected the escalating economic
fallout that has seen world oil prices climb toward $40 per barrel.
   Other World Bank officials suggested that the proposed new
lending program could be used to disburse funds raised by the Gulf
Crisis Financial Coordination Group, a steering committee unveiled
in a speech by President Bush to the opening session of the
IMF-World Bank on Tuesday. However, they said discussions on this
possibility were still in a very preliminary stage.
   On Monday, both the IMF and the World Bank endorsed U.S.-backed
proposals to boost their lending in response to the gulf crisis,
but those increases were to be made in the context of existing
programs at both institutions.
   On another matter, both Camdessus and Conable said they had held
discussions with a delegation from the Soviet Union, which was
attending this year's annual meeting for the first time.
   However, both officials indicated it would be some time before
the Soviet Union would qualify for membership, something the
Soviets desire because it would allow them to tap the huge loan
resources of both agencies.
   While membership is not immediately possible, both Conable and
Camdessus said their institutions would provide technical advice to
help the Soviets in the massive job of reforming their economic
system.

   The resumption of diplomatic ties between Britain
and Iran on Thursday raised modest hopes of freedom for British
hostages in Lebanon, but left unresolved the original dispute over
author Salman Rushdie.
   ``This is good news,'' said Paul Handley, spokesman for
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie. The archbishop's envoy,
Terry Waite, is among three Britons believed held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists.
   ``Of course it does not mean all the problems are solved,''
Handley added. ``But they will be much easier to solve through
normal diplomatic channels.''

unspoken.

   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown has
no intention of sitting back and watching his party self-destruct
in the 1992 presidential election. But he concedes his
determination to play a ``major role'' in selecting the Democratic
nominee is a risky business.
   ``I'm not advocating smoke-filled-room politics,'' he said in an
interview. ``I am advocating common-sense, pragmatic politics which
says we're serious about winning the White House and which says, if
you're serious about that, you've got to take some risks and you've
got to be willing to take some heat.''
   ``We haven't been real successful five of the last six times and
to ignore that fact is really lacking in good judgment,'' Brown
said this week, referring to the fact the Democrats have elected
only one president since 1968.
   Certain to generate the most intense heat was Brown's idea that
not onlyillion barrels in its strategic
reserve. Japan has 208 milion barrels, West Germany claims 53
million barrels, Sweden has 1 million barrels and the rest of
Western Europe, 6 million barrels, according to statistics from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration in Washington.
   The IEA official said President Bush's decision Wednesday to
sell 5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve
wasn't out of line with the agency's position. He said Bush wanted
to test the reserve system to be sure it works.
   The official said he hadn't heard of any U.S. effort to convince
other countries to follow suit.
   U.S. Rep. John Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan who is chairman
of House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the Bush
administration should ask West Germany and Japan to tap their
stockpiles.
   The International Energy Agency's members include the United
States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and virtually every
major Western European country except France and Finland.
   The agency estimates the total crude output by the 13 members of
OPEC at 22 million barrels a day in September, up from 19.7 million
in July. This has helped offset the loss of embargoed Kuwaiti and
Iraqi oil, which totalled about 4.8 million barrels daily.
   The official said OPEC's increased production came primarily
from Saudi Arabia, which has produced an average 7.3 million
barrels a day this month compared to 5.6 million a day in August.
   Given the rise in OPEC output, the official said the world oil
supply was ``manageable, though not comfortable.'' He said oil
companies have had to draw on stockpiles during a period normally
reserved for building up supplies ahead of the high-demand winter
season.
   The U.S. petroleum reserve was established in 1975 as a cushion
against potential future oil shortages. Bush said he may expand
sales from the reserve if ``intensive and unwarranted speculation''
continues.
   The United States uses more than 17 million barrels a day, about
half of it imported.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-1
today to approve President Bush's nomination of Judge David Souter
to the Supreme Court.
   The panel sent its recommendation to the full Senate, where
confirmation was expected within a few days. Republicans urged a
speedy vote so Souter could take his seat before the court opens
its term on Monday.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., cast the only vote against
Souter.
   Souter did not attend the committee session. He remained in New
Hampshire, listening to the proceedings from a radio in the law
office of his close friend, former state attorney general Tom Rath.
   Souter issued a statement several hours after the vote thanking
members of the committee ``for their courtesy and consideration''
and said, ``I am gratified by their action. I await the decision of
the full Senate.''
   Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., joined with six other
committee Democrats and all six Republicans in supporting Souter.
Like many of his Democratic colleagues, Biden said he was troubled
by uncertainty surrounding Souter's positions on rights issues
including abortion.
   ``He's about the best, though, that we're going to be able to do
from this administration,'' Biden said.
   President Bush, in Cleveland to campaign for Republican
candidates, said the committee vote ``is good news for all of us
who are committed to the Constitution of the United States. He'll
be a superb justice for the Supreme Court.''
   He urged the full Senate to ``act as quickly as possible to
confirm this man'' so that he could be seated when the court opens
its session next week.
   ``We probably have as moderate a choice as George Bush will send
to the Senate,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   While Souter did not attend the meeting, many of the activist
groups that worked for or against his nomination were present in
the packed hearing room.
   For nearly two hours prior to the vote, 13 of the 14 senators
read statements on their positions before the television cameras in
the paneled committee room. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a Republican from
Souter's home state of New Hampshire, submitted a written statement
for the record, saying he wanted to speed action on the vote.
   Kennedy broke ranks with his colleagues who wanted to give
Souter the benefit of the doubt. ``The lesson of the past decade
... is that we must vote our fears, not our hopes,'' he said.
   Molly Yard, head of the National Organization for Women, praised
Kennedy for his opposition, telling reporters afterward that his
action was a ``Profile in Courage,'' a reference to a book on great
Americans written by his late brother, President John F. Kennedy.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said women's groups and civil
rights groups urged him to vote against Souter, but he said ``my
sense is that David Souter is a fair and open-minded jurist who
knows well the weight of the responsibilities which will be placed
upon him.''
   ``I hope I'm not wrong,'' he added.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chided any Democrats who use a
``litmus test'' on abortion in opposing Souter. ``I do not believe
that he will impose his own policy preferences on the American
people in the guise of judging.''
   Souter, 51, who spent 12 years on the New Hampshire bench before
joining the federal appeals court in Boston this year, would be the
105th Supreme Court justice if confirmed by the full Senate.
   Souter is Bush's first nominee to the high court and the
president asked the Senate to confirm him before Monday, the first
day of the Supreme Court's 1990-91 term.
   The only announced opposition to Souter in the Senate was from
lawmakers supporting abortion rights. Souter, who would succeed
pro-choice Justice William Brennan, would swing the court against
abortion rights if he voted to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   During his confirmation hearings, Souter said he had not made up
his mind on Roe vs. Wade. But given Bush's anti-abortion stance,
lawmakers were suspicious.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said he will vote against
confirmation of Souter, ``because I can find no basic commitment to
preserving the right to privacy and the right of women to make
their own decisions in the area of reproductive rights,'' Adams
said in a Senate floor speech.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J, said Wednesday in announcing his
opposition to Souter that overturning Roe vs. Wade would ``return
us to the day when illegal back-alley abortions put the lives of
thousands of women at risk.''
   ``That's a chance I'm not willing to take,'' he said.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of two women in the Senate,
said ``we must fear the worst'' because ``Judge Souter refused to
talk about whether, and how, the Constitution protects the women of
America.''
   The Senate majority appeared to be firmly in Souter's camp,
however.
   Several other Democrats, including four on the Judiciary
Committee, announced their support in advance of today's vote. One
Souter ally tracking the nomination said he would be surprised if
there were 20 votes against the nominee in the 100-member Senate.
   Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., a committee member who announced his
support for Souter on Wednesday, reflected the views of many
abortion-rights lawmakers who planned to support the nomination.
   ``At least we didn't hear him say that a woman does not have
that right,'' he said. ``He told me that he would not prejudge the
issue and maybe that is the best we can hope for at this time.''

<TEXT>
   Indian refugees angered by harsh conditions
and long delays in a desert transit camp attacked an airport-bound
van Thursday, staged demonstrations and angrily confronted a
visiting official.
   The incidents betrayed a growing frustration among the nearly
14,000 refugees at the camp, some of whom have waited up to eight
days in the heat and dust with only cucumbers, tomatoes and canned
sardines to eat.
   Children at the transit camp, who now number in the thousands,
are suffering heat exhaustion and diarrhea. Another 14,000 refugees
wait in similar conditions at the adjacent camp of Azraq II, while
thousands more have been placed in camps in Amman.
   Refugees surrounded a van as it was leaving the Azraq I camp,
pulling out the nine people who were on their way to Amman airport
for the trip home, according to witnesses.
   The eight men and one elderly woman on the bus were named
Gujral, the same as India's Foreign Minister Kumar Gujral, and the
refugees mistakenly thought they were relatives being given
preferential treatment, said Dr. A.K. Amrohi, first secretary at
the Indian Embassy in Amman.
   People complain of bureaucratic bungling, insufficient food and
water and cramped conditions that make sleep impossible and the
spread of contagious diseases increasingly likely.
   Some people say their passports have been lost. At least one man
saw his baggage leave on a bus without him. Another hasn't seen his
family since they were put on different buses from the Iraqi border
to the transit camp.
   ``We are trying to sort things out,'' Amhori said, standing in
an airless, hot military tent where five of his staff worked at
tables piled with blue Indian passports.
   ``But the problem is of such a huge dimension, we really can't
move things in an orderly or organized manner,'' he said.
   The Indian government has been flying two planeloads of refugees
a day out of Amman. But many people fear that they are being
forgotten.
   ``We are being told there are flights. If so, they must be
moving buses straight from the border to the airport and not taking
us out,'' said Vincent Pinto, who saw 100 or more refugee surround
the van.
   ``Some people come in and go out the same day, whereas others
wait here six or seven days,'' said Ernest George, a bank teller in
Kuwait until the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion. ``We are all behaving
poperly, but how long? How long? We are desperate.''
   Jordanian officials blame the Indians for the delay, while the
Indians blame the Jordanian police for handing them sacks of
unsorted passports taken from refugees on arrival.
   Vir Singh Jubal, another witness to the van incident, said
Jordanian police arrested an unknown number of refugees. Pinto said
the detainees were released after refugees surrounded the police
post near the camp and threatened to storm it.
   Camp officials denied anyone had been detained. They said the
nine people on the van were allowed to leave within a few hours,
after Indian officials met with angry demonstrators.
   The camp, in the desert outside the oasis of Azraq, is buffeted
by sandstorms that have turned the white tents orange and coated
the beards of the men and the faces of the children with sand and
grit.
   Annamma James arrived in Azraq I eight days ago with 31 members
of her family, including 11 children.
   ``The children have diarrhea. There is not enough to eat. Look
at us, we are all dirty because there is no water to bathe. The
food we brought with us is gone, tomorrow there will be nothing
left.''
   Gazing through glasses covered with dust, she said: ``What are
we going to do?''

   South African officials attending annual world
financial meetings say they'e getting an unusually warm reception
this year but that they don't plan to create any embarrassment by
applying for loans.
   South African Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis said the
well-received visit of President, F.W. de Klerk to Washington
earlier this week would have no short-term economic impact. But he
said it would help build credibility as the country dismantles its
white supremacist system of apartheid.
   Chris Stals, head of the South African government bank, said
there were no plans to apply for IMF loans because of the U.S.
sanctions.
   ``It would unavoidably lead to discussions of the situation with
the U.S. Congress and could embarrass us,'' Stals said.
   Stals, who was attending his 22nd IMF-World Bank meeting, said
private bankers generally talked to him in the past because they
wanted to be polite or were curious about South Africa.
   ```But this year, they're much more interested in the basic
realities,'' he said. ``They're updating files ... and preparing to
do business again.''
   Du Plessis, Stals and other South African officials talked to
reporters during the annual meeting of the International Monetary
Fund and its related institution, the World Bank.
   Despite South Africa's past political isolation because of
apartheid, Du Plessis said, the country has had normal relations
with world financial institutions and was a founding member of both
the IMF and the World Bank.
   It has, however, been denied a seat on the bank's board of
directors and any application for IMF loans must be referred to the
U.S. treasury secretary. Congress has imposed sanctions against
South Africa because of apartheid.
   Du Plessis said South Africa could use help in its efforts to
grow economically.
   ``It is a strange thing for us to be regarded as a developed
country, with very definite needs,'' he said.
   South Africa has complied with all commitments to the two
institutions, paying off its last loans several years ago, he said.
However, it's ineligible for World Bank loans because its per
capita income exceeds $2,000.

<HEAD>Polish Official Says Attempt to Turn Capitalist Endangered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's finance minister said Thursday the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis combined with failure to ease
the massive Polish debt were endangering his country's attempt to
turn capitalist.
   The loss of revenue from business contracts with Iraq and
Kuwait, in addition to the rising price of oil, will cost Poland $2
billion over the coming year, said Leszek Balcerowicz.
   ``Poland has been very severely hit, at a very delicate time''
of the reform program, he told reporters.
   Iraq had been selling oil to Poland at cut-rate prices in return
for a write-off of an estimated $600 million debt incurred during
the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Poland also sold Iraq large
quantities of weapons, and Polish companies were engaged in
construction projects for Iraq's post-war rehabilitation, officials
said.
   The Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has stopped all that, and sent
some 1,000 Polish workers home.
   The crash reform program initiated Jan. 1 by Poland's first
non-communist government is designed to turn the centralized
economy into a market-driven capitalist system. Government
subsidies to businesses have been cut off, raising prices sharply
and forcing enterprises to become competitive or go bankrupt.
   Resulting layoffs have driven unemployment to 5 percent, a level
unknown under the Communist Party which ruled Poland until last
year.
   Balcerowicz, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said
Poland's top priority was to trim its $40-billion debt, two-thirds
of which is owed to other governments and the rest to banks.
   ``How can we convince people there's a light at the end of the
tunnel with the growing debt overhang?'' he said.
   But four days of talks with finance officials and bankers
gathered here for the annual meeting of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, he said, had failed to yield concrete
results.
   ``There was considerable progress in understanding, but a lack
of readiness to act,'' he said. ``Time is crucial.''
   Poland is also facing the problem of having to pay with hard
currency for much of its imports once its main trading partner, the
Soviet Union, goes to a cash-only trade system based on realistic
market values starting Jan. 1.
   Balcerowicz said Poland was negotiating with the Soviets to
ensure there is no disruption in the gas pipeline supplies. The
Soviets have told Poland they will cut the supply from 8.2 billion
cubic meters to 5.2 billion.
   But Balcerowicz said he views this as ``an opening position'' in
negotiations. ``We are insisting on maintaining the supply,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Army Wife Says Her Letters Aren't Getting to the Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The wife of a soldier stationed in Saudi
Arabia said he isn't receiving her letters because thousands of
well-meaning people are jamming the military postal system with
letters addressed to ``Any Soldier.''
   Annie Berg, wife of an Army sergeant first class usually
stationed at Fort Stewart, said Wednesday her husband is ``worried
sick'' because no family letters have reached him during the month
he's been in the desert.
   ``We love their patriotism, but if they could just stop with the
letter writing to just `any soldier,' '' she said. ``My husband is
not just any soldier. My friends' husbands are not just any
soldier. They have families trying to get their letters through.
The letter from home is the best mental nourishment they can get.''
   ``We've had quite a few people complain that they aren't getting
their mail,'' said Dean Wohlgemuth, a spokesman for the 24th
Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart. ``We're trying to
speed it up.''
   Leon Wood, postmaster at the Hinesville post office, said
letters for Fort Stewart soldiers are turned over to the Army Post
Office in New York. He said domestic postal workers treat all
first-class letters the same, whether they are addressed to
specific soldiers or ``any soldier.''
   Maj. Carl Gidlund, spokesman for the Central Command at MacDill
Air Force Base in Florida, said there were complaints about slow
mail deliveries early in the operation and the Army and Air Force
responded by sending more mail specialists.
   Gidlund described Mrs. Berg's problem as ``an isolated
incident.''
   ``All I can do on behalf of the armed forces is apologize,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Berg declined to identify her husband, a 14-year veteran.
She said she feared he might be punished for her remarks.
   ``My husband is worried sick because he hasn't heard from me,''
she said. ``I have many, many friends and their husbands are
writing them saying, `How are you? How are the kids? We've heard
nothing from you.' ''
   Mrs. Berg said she has written her husband at least every other
day and has sent three packages since he left for the Middle East
on Aug. 26.
   She has received three letters from him. She said their three
daughters - Karen, 13; Tia, 9; and Jean, 7 - are upset because
their father writes and says ``Have the girls write me.''

wrote a letter as if it was from a baby who was just born. It was
the serviceman's nephew and it went something like, `You don't know
me yet. I was just born yesterday.' ''
   ``Sometimes it's quite an emotional scene. You see various
family members who are very worried about their loved ones,'' he
said.
   Miss Nwoye, 22, admitted she was to blame for the breakup with
her boyfriend, whom she identified only as John, and said she'll
keep up her faxes every other day until he breaks down and writes
back.
   ``And I also want to let him know that somebody's thinking about
him back here,'' she said as she scrawled her message at an AT&amp;T
Phone Center in Manhattan.
   Emilia Diez, of Yonkers, also stopped at the store to fax her
two nephews - Roy Saravia, 19, in the Air Force, and Luis Saravia,
21, in the Navy.
   Her message included some aunt-like advice:
   ``Lay down when you have to'' and ``we don't need any heroes at
home; we just need you back, safe and sound.''

<HEAD>Court Rules California's Shield Law Protects Reporters in Civil
Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reporters who cover events that lead to
civil lawsuits can't be jailed for refusing to provide notes,
photographs or news sources to parties in the suits, the state
Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The unanimous decision said a shield law added to the California
Constitution by voters in 1980 protects reporters from being held
in contempt of court for withholding confidential sources, notes or
unpublished material.
   The court ruled in May that the law can be breached in a
criminal case, requiring a reporter to provide evidence necessary
to protect a defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial. But
the justices said Thursday that parties in a civil case have no
similar constitutional right.
   ``This is a complete victory for the journalists and the
public,'' said C. Michael Cooney, lawyer for The New York Times
Co., publisher of the Santa Barbara News-Press.
   The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit involving News-Press
photographer Robert Ponce.
   The photographer took pictures of an auto accident on a U.S. 101
ramp in June 1984, two of which appeared in the newspaper.
Volkswagen of America, sued by an injured passenger, sought Ponce's
unpublished photos as evidence.
   Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Patrick McMahon
ordered the newspaper to release the photos, saying they showed
public events and were not confidential. The 2nd District Court of
Appeal overturned his ruling and was upheld by the state Supreme
Court.

<HEAD>Democrats Ask FEC to Halt GOP Fund-Raising Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats asked the Federal Election
Commission on Thursday to halt a Republican fund-raising scheme
they said could illegally raise millions of dollars for GOP Senate
candidates.
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asked the
commission to ``put an immediate stop'' to the Republican
Senatorial Inner Circle, which already has disbursed about $1
million to dozens of candidates.
   The Inner Circle is a ``dressed-up version'' of a 1986 GOP
operation that the FEC found in violation of limits on party
contributions, said Bob Bauer, general counsel for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Republicans defend the Inner Circle as a legitimate joint
fund-raising operation exempt from the contribution limits.
   Federal law allows party committees to give candidates $17,500
and spend an additional amount on their behalf according to
individual state populations.
   A federal judge last year ruled in a lawsuit filed by Common
Cause that the National Republican Senatorial Committee illegally
funneled $2.7 million in individual contributions to a dozen 1986
Senate candidates through a maneuver known as ``bundling.'' The FEC
has asked the court to fine the NRSC as much as $2.7 million.
   The differences between the 1986 and 1990 operations ``are no
more than cosmetic,'' the Democrats said in a complaint filed with
the FEC.
   The Inner Circle cannot qualify as a joint fund-raising
operation if NRSC controls where the money goes, provides the staff
and receives just 1 percent of the money it raises, the complaint
said.
   ``The scale of the ... effort is extraordinary,'' the complaint
said. ``It is the most monumental fund-raising effort ever mounted
by a national party committee on behalf of its individual federal
candidates.''
   NRSC spokeswoman Wendy Burnley called the complaint ``a last
gasp desperate attempt to gain press attention, particularly in the
states where the most hotly contested campaigns are going on.''
   Democrats are worried about the money that the Inner Circle
could infuse into campaigns for television advertising that could
tip some close races, she said.
   The operation replaces a fund-raising program started 11 years
ago in which $1,000 donors were invited to Washington for briefings
on issues and social events with Republican lawmakers and
officials, Burnley said. The Inner Circle is run separately from
the NRSC, which is reimbursed for staff costs, she said.
   The operation expects to raise as much as $11.5 million this
year, with most of that going to GOP candidates, according to a
letter mailed to potential contributors under the signature of Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Four dozen campaigns are members of the Inner Circle, including
the 27 candidates running this year and 21 GOP senators who face
re-election in 1992 or 1994. Contributions are divided according to
a formula based on the needs of the candidates.
   Candidates received shares of $7,200 to $43,500 in June and
additional amounts in August, mostly in amounts of $4,000 to
$10,000, according to FEC records.

<HEAD>Industry Wants Air Traffic Controllers Exempted from Furloughs</HEAD>

   The airline industry Thursday asked President
Bush to exempt air traffic controllers from furloughs if a budget
agreement isn't reached by Monday.
   ``Your action would ensure continuity in the day-to-day
operation of our air traffic control system,'' Robert J. Aaronson,
president of the Air Transport Association of America, said in a
letter to the president.
   Aaronson said traffic controllers, maintenance technicians,
safety inspectors and weather personnel are ``vital to the safe and
efficient operation of the nation's air traffic control system.''
   ``This is essential to protect the overall public interest as
well as the continuing viability of the nation's airline industry
and the many other industries which depend on it,'' he said.
   Stephen Hart, deputy White House press secretary, said the
administration would not respond until and unless Monday's deadline
is reached without agreement to avoid deep budget cuts.
   Progress was reported Thursday in the continuing talks.
   ``A good deal has been agreed to tentatively,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   One administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the air traffic controllers were likely to be
exempted even if an agreement isn't reached.
   The administration has said it will continue essential services
on the basis of an opinion issued by Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti during the Carter administration.
   If budget negotiators fail to reach an accord by the start of
the new fiscal year Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration has
proposed to furlough each of its controllers for two days every two
weeks. That would mean an average 25 percent reduction in the
number of controllers available for work each day.
   Jack Ryan, association vice president for air traffic
management, said plans called for dealing with the situation by
delaying flights next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
   On Thursday, he said, flight cancellations would begin.
   He said delays at major airports would be ``in excess of three
or four or five hours'' if the weather was good and even longer if
it was bad.
   Aaronson told reporters ``It's absolutely ludicrous to hold the
air traffic control system of the country hostage to a budget
crisis.''

<HEAD>Governor Seeks to Restore Spending Cut Before Oil-Prices Run-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dramatic run-up in oil prices is
boosting Alaska's treasury and has prompted the administration to
propose restoring millions of dollars to programs that were cut in
July.
   One of eight barrels of North Slope oil goes to the state, which
also derives revenues from severance taxes on oil production. The
state derives 85 percent of its revenue from oil and gas
production. A $1 a barrel increase in oil prices adds $150 million
in yearly revenues to the state treasury.
   Oil prices shot up from $13 a barrel in July to current spot
market prices of $37 a barrel, fueled by fear of war with Iraq.
   State budget director Alison Elgee said a proposed $50 million
supplemental spending package of more than $50 million is being
prepared for the next governor who will be elected in November. Any
new spending plan would have to be approved by the Legislature,
which convenes in mid-January.
   Elgee said about half the proposed supplemental expenditures
would go toward restoration of programs and services cut by
Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper's vetoes in July. The rest would cover
such things as state employee wage increases and expenses for oil
spill litigation, she said.
   Current state spending is pegged at $2.6 billion for the current
fiscal year. Cowper cut $325 million in July, citing sagging oil
prices and overspending by the legislature.
   Cowper, who is not seeking re-election, said he wants the state
to save most of the windfall generated by the Middle East crisis.
   ``I think most people believe there will be a substantial
surplus,'' Cowper said. ``My view is that most of the money should
be saved. We're not going to recommend enormous sums be put back
into the budget.''

<HEAD>World Community Gives Standing Ovation to Exiled Emir of Kuwait</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The exiled emir of Kuwait thanked the
world community Thursday for its support and mourned the
destruction of his country at the hands of Iraqi invaders.
   ``The crisis of Kuwait is a manifold tragedy whose dire
consequences affect not only Kuwaitis, but other peoples as well,''
the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, told the United Nations
General Assembly. ``In fact, it has jeopardized stability in the
world, especially in the (Persian) Gulf region.''
   The three-member Iraqi delegation got up and walked out as the
emir began speaking, but the rest of the General Assembly greeted
his remarks with prolonged applause and a standing ovation.
   Al-Sabah, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter, told
delegates that ``rape, destruction, terror'' now reign in Kuwait,
overrun by Iraq's ``naked, brutal aggression.''
   Addressing his own people, he expressed hope that the occupation
would end.
   ``The withdrawal of the invaders is, God willing, undoubtedly
imminent,'' he said. ``We shall return to our Kuwait, the oasis of
safety and peace.''
   Iraq has said it will never relinquish Kuwait.
   During the Aug. 2 invasion, the emir escaped from Dasman Palace
in Kuwait by car, fleeing just moments ahead of Iraqi troops sent
to seize him.
   The undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, Ronald
Spiers, pointedly introduced the emir as the leader of the ``state
of Kuwait,'' and Guido de Marco, the president of the General
Assembly, heavily stressed the phrase ``state of Kuwait'' in
thanking the emir for his remarks.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait six days after the invasion, and says it now
considers the emirate an Iraqi province. But the world community
has refused to recognize the Iraqi claim.
   The emir thanked the assembled diplomats for their ``rock-solid
international rejection of the assassination of the norms of
international law and of good neighborly relations,'' and denounced
the ``armed military invaders whose tanks rolled over and crushed
all those customs.''
   Al-Sabah appealed for continued support from the world body.
   ``The fate of a nation is in your hands,'' he said.
   The emir, whose exile government is headquartered in Saudi
Arabia, said reports of conditions in Kuwait under the Iraqi
invasion were devastating.
   ``I came here to tell you of the horrors and suffering we are
enduring both inside and outside our occupied homeland,'' he said.
``Rape, destruction, terror and torture are now the rule of the day
in the once peaceful and tranquil land of Kuwait.''
   But he added that ``an enormous source of solace to us has been
the position taken by virtually all countries of the world in
support of Kuwait's rights.''

<TEXT>
   Part of a cargo door that tore away from a
United Airlines jet over the Pacific Ocean in 1989 has been
recovered from the ocean floor 100 miles south of Honolulu, the
National Transportation Safety Board announced today.
   Nine people died when the door and a large chunk of fuselage
broke off from the Boeing 747 shortly after takeoff from Honolulu
International Airport on Feb. 14, 1989.
   The board said the recovered piece - the lower half of the door
- measures 6 feet by 10 feet.
   The announcement said the fragment was recovered overnight from
a field of debris at a depth of 14,100 feet. Officials said they
hoped to retrieve the other half of the door by the end of the
week.
   The board said the Navy submarine Sea Cliff videotaped the piece
of the airplane on the ocean floor and raised it to the surface
with hydraulic jaws. It was brought onto the deck of the Navy
vessel the Laney Choust at about 5 a.m. EDT today, midnight
Honolulu time.
   The safety board said a preliminary examination by one of its
investigators showed the door had fractured longitudinally near the
midspan latch. The eight sectors of the latch lock were all in the
locked position and were deformed.
   The board said the Sea Cliff had also detected a strong sonar
target near the spot where the door portion was found. It said the
submarine would return to try to locate the remainder of the door
after being recharged for about 20 hours.
   After investigators examine the recovered debris, parts of it
will be sent to Boeing in Seattle for a more detailed review under
board direction, officials said.
   The door flew off after United Airlines flight 811 experienced
an explosive decompression at about 23,000 feet.

   The Persian Gulf buildup will be insulated
from possible mandatory budget cuts but other military operations
will be severely affected, the Defense Department said Thursday.
   ``One of the goals is to try to prevent any impact on Operation
Desert Shield,'' said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. ``We are
attempting to isolate that from the effects of a sequestration.''
   But Williams said other spending would be cut by as much as 35.3
percent in all areas except military personnel.
   The readiness of military forces outside the Persian Gulf area,
where about 150,000 U.S. military personnel are on guard against an
attack by Iraq against Saudi Arabia, ``would have to be degraded,''
he said.
   Cuts in such operations of a third to one half could be
expected, he said.
   If cuts are made, the Pentagon said:
   -Disruption of the work force would be avoided as much as
possible but civilian employees of some small defense agencies
could expect furloughs of several days.
   -A temporary halt of payments in all medical benefit claims made
by Army civilians and their families and by the families of Army
personnel would be ordered.
   -Depot maintenance and other logistics programs would be done
out at ``the lowest practicable level'' while still supporting
Desert Shield. The Pentagon said that would mean revoking NATO
agreements, adding that posed the potential for grounding aircraft.
   -All base engineering and housing construction and maintenance
would be deferred, except for work to correct life-threatening
conditions or to address major environmental concerns.
   -Travel, transportation, rents and utilities would be severely
restricted.
   There is a possibility Congress may extend the deadline for
budget cuts beyond Monday, the start of the 1991 fiscal year, to
give White House and congressional negotiators more time to reach a
budget compromise, Williams said.
   ``But if sequestration is not suspended, then the impact would
be very severe here,'' he said.

<HEAD>Milwaukee Approves Two Schools Tailored for Black Males</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public school officials have approved of a plan
to create two schools next year that will cater to the needs and
experiences of young black male students.
   The Milwaukee School Board voted 5-3 Wednesday night to
designate an elementary school and a middle school beginning with
the 1991-92 school year as African-American Immersion Schools.
   Milwaukee is believed to be the first public school district in
the nation to approve a specific curriculum for black males,
supporters said. The District of Columbia's school board is
considering a similar plan.
   ``It's fair to say that the achievement levels of
African-American males have not been good,'' said Milwaukee school
spokesman Dave Begel. ``This is an attempt to improve it.''
   While the two experimental schools will be open to all students
to comply with anti-discrimination laws, their curriculum will
stress African heritage and the special educational, social and
emotional needs of young black males, Begel said.
   More than 50 percent of the Milwaukee Public School District's
98,000 students are black. Supporters claim many blacks suffer low
achievement in the district because they lose their identity or
become discouraged by a curriculum that stresses the heritage of
whites.
   A citizen's task force initiated the African-American school
plan after its study found that fewer than 20 percent of the 5,716
black male students in Milwaukee high schools had a grade average
of C or better.
   The group also found 50 percent of all students suspended from
district schools last year were black males, even though they make
up only 27.6 percent of the total enrollment. The district's high
school dropout rate also stood at 14.4 percent last year. The task
force didn't study the rates for black female students.
   Leaders of Milwaukee's black community have supported the plan
throughout its development, saying the schools will be an
alternative to traditional public education that has stressed
European heritage.
   ``A lot of African-American students, male and female, just
don't have any sense of what we have gone through and come through
as a people,'' said Alderman Marvin Pratt, who represents a mostly
black, inner-city district.
   ``What's missing for a lot of young people is the pride in
African history that I think an Afro-centric curriculum will
foster,'' he said.
   The approved proposal was modified from an earlier plan to
establish three all-black, all-male schools. The earlier plan was
scrapped after educators and lawyers advised it would be challenged
as unconstitutional.
   Board Member Doris Stacy opposed the proposal, arguing ``it's
unconstitutional, it's educationally unsound, it's morally wrong.
To isolate students by race in America in 1990 is wrong.''
   Ms. Stacy said the district needs to focus on black males but it
would be better to create a program that ``incorporates a nurturing
environment for all our children.''
   The poor performance of black students was cited in another
educational experiment began this year. The Wisconsin Legislature
this spring approved a plan to provide $2,500 vouchers to as many
as 1,000 poor Milwaukee students, allowing them to leave public
schools for private, non-sectarian schools.
   The plan survived a court challenge and began this month with
about 400 students enrolled in private schools.

<TEXT>
   Former East German secret police officers
still hold top jobs in business, while others have thwarted police
investigations, a parliamentary report said Thursday.
   ``There is the possibility that parts of the Stasi apparatus are
still functioning,'' said Joachim Gauck, head of the lawmakers'
commission overseeing the breakup of the secret police. The secret
police was known as the Stasi.
   East Germans have become obsessed with the brutal legacy of the
Communist organization, and have unmasked former members and
collaborators.
   West Germany's ARD television this week ran a documentary with
interviews of East Germans complaining that former secret police
members still retain a grip on the nation's factories.
   Almost daily, new disclosures emerge about the Stasi, which had
about 200,000 members, collaborators and informers before the
government said it would disband.
   Of the 2,448 elite Stasi officers put in top positions
throughout the country by the Communists, one-half have been
targeted for investigations, said Gauck, chairman of the
parliamentary commission.
   The other half remains active, especially in the nation's
businesses, he told a news conference. Gauck is a member of the
leftist party Alliance 90.
   East German companies are attempting to break free from 40 years
of centrally planned Communist administration, to be transformed
into capitalist enterprises.
   There have been concerns that members of the old government,
especially former Stasi members, could try to disrupt the economic
transition with West Germany. The merger between the two Germanys
is set for Wednesday.
   Another parliamentary commission member, Jes Moeller of the
Social Democratic Party, said that former Stasi members still on
the job had hindered investigations into economic crimes.
   ``In police offices, the Stasi officers are responsible for
economic crimes and they have thrown out criminal complaints
against managers of Stasi-run companies,'' Moeller said.
   For months East Germans have complained that the same people who
were in key functions under the Communists have stayed in those
posts under the democratically elected government.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Thursday that the
Stasi transferred about $100 million to the renamed Communist
Party.
   Leaders of the party then distributed the money to numerous
people, apparently to keep it from being seized by investigators,
according to Bild.

   The Art Institute of Chicago hopes a free
breakfast will go a long way toward steering visitors in its
direction.
   The museum treated about 100 taxi drivers to Danish pastry,
juice, coffee and a tour Wednesday in the hope that the
steering-wheel philosophers will talk up the place to their fares.
   ``Chicago taxi drivers really are roving ambassadors,'' museum
spokeswoman Eileen Harakal said. ``Not only do they answer
passengers' questions on Chicago's attractions, but they help steer
people to them.''
   The Art Institute's current special exhibit, ``From Poussin to
Matisse: The Russian Taste For French Painting,'' is sponsored by
Sara Lee Corp., which provided the breakfast to cabbies and
chauffeurs. The museum waived the exhibit's $6 entry fee and opened
the show an hour early for the drivers.
   ``It's a great idea,'' said cab driver Bill Hogan as he
contemplated Henri Matisse's ``Still Life with a Blue Tablecloth.''
``When people ask what there is to see in Chicago I usually say the
Sears Tower, the Museum of Science and Industry and the Shedd
Aquarium. Now I'll mention the Art Institute.''
   Talk of taxi lease increases and rising gas prices intermingled
with conversation about French art as the cabbies strolled past the
exhibit's 51 paintings.
   ``Cab drivers bring the Art Institute quite a bit of business,''
said cabbie Charles Thomatis. ``I always tell passengers how nice
it is. Now I've got the chance to come in and take a peek for
myself.''
   Enjoyment of the paintings seemed to override worries about
missed fares for some drivers.
   ``You've got to take a little time out for yourself,'' said
cabbie Bill Davis. ``Drivers spend 10-12 hours sitting behind the
wheel of a cab. So this is fantastic. It's one of the best things
people have done for us.''
   Not all taxi drivers were impressed.
   ``If they really wanted to thank us they would've served
breakfast at the curb,'' John Martins said. ``They could have let
us roll by, pick up our coffee and doughnuts and go back to work.''

<HEAD>Deposit Insurance Fund Dwindling; Regulators Boost Rates</HEAD>

   Regulators learned Thursday the government
fund protecting bank accounts is dwindling faster than thought only
two months ago, and they voted a 1991 increase of more than 60
percent on the deposit insurance premiums charged banks.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s bank fund dropped from
$13.2 billion at the end of last year to $11.4 billion at the end
of June - a 14 percent decline.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said he now expects that by the
end of the year the fund will have lost ``closer to $3 billion''
rather than the $2 billion he earlier predicted.
   ``This ... is the result of an increased number of institutions
being likely to fail and continued erosion in real estate
markets,'' Seidman told members of a House panel in a meeting which
followed the FDIC vote to boost premiums.
   If continuing bank failures were to exhaust the insurance fund,
Congress and the Bush administration would have to consider a
taxpayer bailout, as they have with the S&amp;L insurance fund.
   After receiving the new financial report, the five-member FDIC
board raised the insurance premium charged banks by more than 60
percent.
   Banks in 1991 will pay 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits, up
from 12 cents this year and 8.3 cents last year. The higher rate
will raise the fund's premium income from $2.8 billion in 1990 to
$4.8 billion in 1991.
   Under last year's S&amp;L bailout law, the premium had been
scheduled to rise to 15 cents. Regulators began considering an
added emergency increase after Seidman told senators in July that
the bank fund likely would suffer its third consecutive loss.
   In mid-August they proposed the maximum increase allowed by law,
to 19.5 cents. By comparison, savings institutions pay a 23-cent
premium.
   The bank fund's $1.84 billion loss in the first six months of
1990 has reduced the level of reserves in the fund to only 60 cents
for every $100 of insured deposits. The minimum considered safe is
$1.25 per $100. At the end of 1987, the level was $1.10.
   Sixty cents is the lowest point in the fund's history and the
congressional General Accounting Office has warned that if the
economy dips into a recession, the fund could be wiped out.
   Banks have a variety of options for absorbing higher premiums
including charging savers higher fees and paying them less
interest, charging borrowers more for loans, reducing dividends to
stockholders or cutting payroll and other expenses.
   ``Undoubtedly some part of it will be passed along (to bank
customers), but certainly all of it won't be passed along,''
Seidman told the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions.
   The agency's staff calculated that if all of the difference
between the 19.5-cent assessment and the previously scheduled
15-cent assessment were passed to depositors, the annual return on
a $10,000 deposit would decline by $4.50.
   If the 19.5-cent rate had been in effect last year instead of
the 8.3-cent rate and banks absorbed all of it, 69 additional banks
would have recorded losses instead of a profit and four more banks
would have failed.
   Administration-backed legislation that passed the House last
week and is pending in the Senate would give the FDIC power to
raise premiums as high as it decided was necessary.
   If the legislation passes before Congress adjourns next month,
Seidman said his board would consider further premium increases.
With a 19.5-cent premium, the fund would not reach the minimum safe
level until after 1995, he told the House panel.
   However, he warned that at some point forcing banks to pay more
becomes counterproductive by weakening the industry.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., has proposed assessing banks a
one-time charge of $1 for every $100 in deposits, raising $25
billion for the insurance fund. They would be expected to replenish
the money as it is spent.
   That, Seidman warned, could drive 28 banks into insolvency and
push 241 banks below minimum capital requirement.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said regulators should force banks to
raise more capital from investors or retain earnings as a buffer
against losses. Regulators should threaten to remove senior bank
management unless they raise capital, he said.
   ``One has to be a logical nincompoop to think that more premiums
are a preferable route. More premiums make the system weaker. More
capital makes the system stronger,'' he said.

   Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria's independence
leader and first president, ended a decade of exile Thursday,
deman you up as
volunteers.''
   Ben Bella, who recently flew to Iraq for talks with Saddam,
urged supporters to stage a protest at the U.S. Embassy denouncing
the American military deployment in the Persian Gulf.
   It was Ben Bella's first time back in Algeria since he
voluntarily went into exile in Europe in 1981 following 15 years in
prison. He became Algeria's first president in 1962 after the
eight-year independence war against France, but was overthrown in a
military coup led by Army chief Col. Houari Boumedienne in 1965 and
imprisoned.
   A throng of people massed along a seaside boulevard, chanting
Ben Bella's name, as the car ferry Hoggar arrived from Barcelona.
Other boats in the harbor blared horns and sirens in welcome.
   Ben Bella said he hoped to forge a new political coalition that
would defeat the long-ruling National Liberation Front, to which he
once belonged. Legislative elections are scheduled by the end of
March, but Ben Bella said the government should resign immediately.
   ``The government has no more credibility, and thus cannot
prepare for the next elections,'' he said.
   In his rambling address in French and Arabic, Ben Bella hailed
radical Arab leaders and their causes.
   ``Long live Palestine!'' he cried. ``Long live Iraq! Long live
Saddam! Long live Libya! Long live Moammar Gadhafi!''
   Ben Bella returns home as Islamic fundamentalists stand poised
to win legislative elections in six months. With or without them,
Ben Bella hopes to forge an alliance of opposition parties.
   The former president had disappointed partisans by not returning
for local and regional elections June 12, Algeria's first
multiparty balloting since 1962. He had urged a boycott of those
elections, claiming they would be rigged by the ruling National
Liberation Front.
   The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front swept a majority of
local and regional councils in the vote, becoming the country's
dominant political group.

   The nation's inventory of corn as of Sept. 1,
the beginning of the new crop marketing year was more than 1.34
billion bushels, down 30 percent from a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Despite the drop from the year-earlier level, the estimated
Sept. 1 corn inventory was slightly more than the 1.33 billion
bushels USDA had projected Sept. 12.
   Of the total stockpile, 755 million bushels were stored on
farms, down 22 percent from a year earlier, according to the
quarterly report. The off-farm stocks of 590 million bushels were
down 39 percent.
   Soybean inventories, reported at 239.1 million bushels, were up
31 percent from a year earlier. On-farm stocks, at 86 million
bushels, were 2 percent below Sept. 1, 1989. The off-farm supply of
153 million bushels was up 62 percent.
   All wheat was reported at 2.4 billion bushels, up 25 percent
from a year earlier. On-farm inventories of 995 million bushels
were up 20 percent, while the off-farm stocks of 1.41 billion
bushels were up 30 percent.
   Barley stored in all positions on Sept. 1 were reported at 411
million bushels, down 1 percent from a year ago. Farm-stored
inventories totaled 258 million bushels, up 2 percent. The off-farm
stockpile was 152 million bushels, down 7 percent.
   Sorghum holdings on Sept. 1 were estimated at less than 220
million bushels, down 50 percent from a year ago. Those included
30.3 million bushels on farms, down 37 percent, and 189.5 million
bushels off farms, down 52 percent.

   The National Science Foundation is awarding
$8.6 million in grants to encourage middle schools and high schools
to begin making sweeping changes in the way science is taught,
officials said Thursday.
   The grants represent the foundation's largest single effort to
reform pre-college science education since the Sputnik era of the
1950s, said Luther Williams, assistant director for education and
human resources.
   The project wants to update teaching methods, increase the time
students spend on science and strengthen teacher training.
   Six three-year grants were awarded from 12 proposals.
   The National Science Teachers Association, the overall
coordinator of the project, received $1.5 million; Baylor College
of Medicine, $1.3 million; the California Department of Education,
$1.4 million; the University of Iowa, $1.4 million; the University
of North Carolina at Wilmington, $1.5 million; and the University
of Puerto Rico, $1.4 million.
   The Education Department funded $1.6 million of the earlier
stages of the project.
   The grant recipients will develop programs that will be tested
in schools.
   Current science education follows a pattern in grades seven
through nine - life science in grade seven, earth science in grade
eight, and another year of science in grade nine, either life
science or physical science, said William Aldridge, executive
director of the science teachers group.
   Aldridge said that high school sciences follow a ``rigid layer
cake approach'' that teaches facts and terminology without relating
the information to the students' daily lives.
   Using the grants, new science curriculum materials will be
tested in regional middle and high schools. National curriculum
materials based on the regional materials then will be developed
and distributed by the science teachers association.
   Aldridge said course content would be coordinated and subjects
offered over three or four years instead of just one year, which
would lead to a more integrated high school science education.
   The California Department of Education is coordinating the
reform efforts of 214 high school and junior or middle schools
across the state, said Tom Sachse of the California education
department. A key focus will be on teacher training, he said.
   The University of Puerto Rico plans to develop techniques to
integrate mathematics with the sciences in grades seven through
nine. It also will produce materials in Spanish.
   The grants were awarded under the foundation's Science and Math
Education Network's Scope, Sequence, and Coordination program.

<HEAD>Finale of Canada's Indian Standoff Does Not Mean End to Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 78-day standoff between Mohawks and
authorities in Quebec left ill feelings that may not quickly fade,
but one positive offshoot was that it focused attention on the
plight of Canada's native tribes, experts said Thursday.
   After the surrender of the last Mohawk holdouts on Wednesday,
federal and provincial governments were congratulating themselves
for avoiding major violence, and creating a new program designed to
be more sensitive to Indians.
   Meanwhile, Indians and other observers warn it won't take much
for similar situations to erupt again.
   ``The Indians are starting to say that we've come down to the
wire and we are going to hold the white man to his word,'' said
Bruce Clark, a London, Ontario, lawyer who has studied historical
documents relating to Indian relations with the government.
   ``The white man talks about the rule of law as his great gift,
let's see if we can hold him to it,'' he said.
   Georges Erasmus, grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations,
the national grouping of Canadian Indian bands, said ``there is a
tremendous onus now on the Canadian government and the Quebec
government.''
   About 50 Mohawks, including women and children, surrendered
Wednesday after being camped for nearly a month inside a drug and
alcohol treatment center in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal. They
were taken to a nearby military base.
   The withdrawal ended a conflict that began July 11 over plans by
Oka officials to expand a golf course onto land claimed by Indians.
Dozens of people were injured and one Quebec police office was
killed in clashes.
   The golf course issue was settled early on when the federal
government bought the disputed land and said it would turn it over
to the Mohawks. But blockades set up at Oka and Kanawake, south of
Montreal, were joined by sympathy blockades by Indian bands across
the country.
   Most observers feel it was the public pressure and the
continuing negative image of Canadian officials that finally pushed
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Tuesday to announce his new
program for dealing with natives.
   He said the program would cover four points: ``land claims; the
economic and social conditions on reserves; the relationship
between aboriginal peoples and governments, and concerns of
Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life.''
   ``Canada's aboriginal peoples deserve a special place in this
country as our first citizens, based on the aboriginal and treaty
rights recognized in the constitution,'' the prime minister said.
   But he added: ``I will be very clear on this point: native
self-government does not now and cannot ever mean sovereign
independence. Mohawk lands are a part of Canadian territory, and
Canadian law must and does apply.''
   That issue of law and jurisdiction are major issues between the
government and many of the country's native bands.
   ``The situation is, we do not have ordinary Canadians here,''
Erasmus said, referring to the Oka crisis. ``We have Mohawk people
that have been here for tens of thousands of years. They have not
ever voluntarily entered into a treaty that has extinguished their
rights.
   ``What is necessary is an understanding of how aboriginal
rights, treaty rights, mesh with the civilian code in Quebec and
with Canadian law.''
   There are about 450,000 ``status,'' or registered, Indians in
Canada and 33,000 Inuit, often called Eskimos. These native people
make up 593 bands on 2,234 reserves covering 6.4 million acres.
   For many reserve Indians, life is a continuous struggle against
poverty, alcoholism, poor health services. They also face lack of
plumbing, sewage disposal and drinking water. Death by injury or
poisoning is quadruple that for the rest of Canada; life expectancy
is nine years less than for a white Canadian.
   Natives in general have a deep well of sympathy among white
Canadians, but the Indian struggles take place mostly in obscure
camps and reserves far from the general population.
   Taking up arms ``can't help but come up again,'' said attorney
Clark.
   ``There are two solutions. One is the rule of law. The other is
self-help. We are at the point now where Indians are tired of
talking. Will violence happen again? It's almost a certainty that
it will.''
   Clark quotes from a royal proclamation of 1763 that guarantees
the right of Indians to self-government. He says that was
reaffirmed in the 1982 constitution.
   ``Canadian history from that point took a very different road
from that of the United States. From that point, the Indians in
Canada laid down their arms. There was no Indian warfare.
   ``Either Canada will honor its own constitutional law, or it
will have to change its constitutional law.''
   The natives say they have taken the government at its word, that
it will enter into serious negotiations with the Indians now that
the Mohawks at Oka have laid down their arms.
   ``The end of the standoff is just the first step,'' said Ethel
Blondin, an Indian member of the House of Commons. ``The government
must cough up what it appeared to promise.
   ``The only way that's going to work ... is to move quickly.''

<TEXT>
   Iran and Britain announced Thursday that
they have restored relations, the latest of several diplomatic
successes for Iran since neighboring Iraq threatened the Persian
Gulf with its invasion of Kuwait.
   London and Tehran had severed diplomatic ties following
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call in February 1989 to kill British
author Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses''
infuriated Moslems worldwide.
   The restoration raised modest hopes of freedom for British
hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon, but left
unresolved the dispute over Rushdie, who has been in hiding since
Khomeini's death call.
   The announcement at the United Nations - by British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd and in a statement from Iran's U.N. Mission
- said the embassies would reopen in London and Tehran within a
month.
   Hurd retreated into heavy diplomatic parlance when asked about
Rushdie.
   ``It is our understanding from public statements made by Iranian
officials that the Iranian government respects the law and would
not interfere in the internal affairs of any other country -
anymore than the United Kingdom would.''
   That was taken as an assurance that Iran would not try to send
assassins after Rushdie, who is believed to still be in Britain.
   Hurd said the other outstanding issues between the two
countries, including the British hostages held in Lebanon by
Islamic fundamentalists loyal to Iran's Shiite revolution, are
better discussed at the full diplomatic level.
   Hurd also praised Iran for voting for U.N. embargoes against
Iraq despite improving relations between Iran and its former emeny.
   In Washington, the State Department said it had no comment on
British-Iranian announcement. ``That's between them,'' department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   The Iranian statement gave no the reason for the restoration of
relations, saying only that it was based on ``mutual respect.''
   In the past six weeks, Iran has gained land, peace, money and
some respect, benefiting at least in part from the changing
alignment of the Middle East following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Iraq, facing a U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia and
the gulf, caved into Iranian demands to seek a formal end to the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The two sides exchanged prisoners of war,
freed hundreds of thousands of troops from their border and agreed
this month to resume diplomatic relations.
   Iraq also withdrew from Iranian territory occupied during the
war and agreed to share sovereignty over a disputed waterway.
   Western nations, meanwhile, have sought closer relations with
Iran, whose more than 700-mile border with Iraq makes Iranian
support critical to U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. Iran has said it
will honor the trade embargo.
   On Sept. 21, the United States paid a $200 milliion claim for
undelivered American equipment orders dating from before the 1979
Islamic revolution. It was the largest claim before a tribunal
settling billions in Iranian assets frozen by the United States.
   Iran has recently been less hostile to the West, and Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking Western ties and aid to
rebuild Iran following the war.
   In February 1989, Khomeini issued the death threat against
Rushdie, saying his novel blasphemed Islam.
   Iranian officials did not terminate the threat when Khomeini
died in June 1989. They had demanded that Britain condemn the book
as a condition to restoring relations. British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government did not do so, but it acknowledged
that parts of ``The Satanic Verses'' might be considered insulting
to Moslems.
   Rushdie, who was born in India, is a British citizen.
   The resumption of relations raised hopes Tehran might now work
for securing the release of the British hostages held in Lebanon.
   The resumption of ties also raised speculation that Roger
Cooper, a British businessman imprisoned in Iran since 1985 on
espionage charges, may be freed.
   Iranian authorities have said Cooper, 54, has been tried and
convicted, but the sentence has never been made public.
   British officials had cited Cooper's ordeal and that of the
hostages in Lebanon as major obstacles in resumption of
London-Tehran ties.
   There have been increasing signs from Tehran that it is
searching for an end to the hostage issue. It admitted in April
that it helped free two Americans, Frank Reed and Robert Polhill,
and President Bush's administration publicly thanked Iran.
   Last month, Tehran also was said to have played a major role in
securing the release of Irishman Brian Keenan, a native of Belfast
who also carried a British passport.
   The four British hostages are among the 13 Westerners believed
held, most by captors loyal to Iran. They are Church of England
envoy Terry Waite, retired fighter pilot Jack Mann, and journalists
John McCarthy and Alec Collett.

<HEAD>Judge Limits Birth Mother's Visits in Custody Battle Over Test-Tube
Baby</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A surrogate mother who gave birth to a
baby created by another couple's sperm and egg was limited Thursday
to two visits a week with the child, who is living for the time
being with his genetic parents. Superior Court Judge Richard
Parslow cut birth mother Anna Johnson's daily visits to twice a
week after hearing testimony from the infant's court-appointed
guardian, William Steiner, that tension between Ms. Johnson and the
genetic parents was detrimental to the baby.
   Parslow also followed Steiner's recommendation that the baby
remain in the custody of genetic parents Mark and Crispina Calvert
at least until a parental rights hearing Oct. 9.
   ``I think it would be in the best interest of the child to
remain with the Calverts,'' Steiner said.
   Ms. Johnson, 29, sued last August for custody of the child.
   Attorneys in the case have called it unprecedented because Ms.
Johnson is seeking custody of a child to whom she has no genetic
link. In the much-publicized Baby M case in New Jersey, the
surrogate mother was also the baby's genetic mother.
   Ms. Johnson, who worked with Mrs. Calvert at a Santa Ana
hospital, was hired by the couple for $10,000 to bear their
test-tube baby. Mrs. Calvert, 36, was medically unable to carry a
child, although she could produce ova.
   The surrogate sued for custody, child support and damages on
Aug. 13, alleging the couple failed to provide agreed-upon
financial and emotional support after supposedly losing interest in
the pregnancy.
   Attorney Richard Gilbert, representing Ms. Johnson, argued
Thursday that his client should be allowed to continue seeing the
child each day. Ms. Johnson did not attend the hearing.
   Gilbert maintains the baby belongs with Ms. Johnson because she
was the birth mother. The Calverts are seeking custody because it
was the embryo from their egg and sperm that was implanted in Ms.
Johnson.
   The baby, born Sept. 19, was discharged from St. Joseph Hospital
in Orange on Saturday and given to the Calverts.
   Technically, the baby is still unnamed, but Ms. Johnson calls
him Matthew and the Calverts call him Michael Christopher.
   Last Friday, Parslow awarded temporary custody of the baby to
the Calverts. The judge was going to send the baby to a foster home
because attorneys for the couple and the surrogate were unable to
agree on interim custody. But Ms. Johnson rejected the foster home
idea.

   Gov. Guy Hunt's re-election bid has picked
up the endorsement of the Alabama Empire of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, but he said the organization's backing does not mean he

   Steve Stone, grand dragon of the white supremacist group, said
the KKK was backing the Republican Hunt, but ``not because he is a

   ``As the political system has evolved in the last decade or so,
we've got very few choices to really endorse,'' said Stone.
   Hunt said earlier this week that he was unaware of the Klan
endorsement, which was announced over the weekend.
   ``People have to accept me for what I am,'' he said. ``An
endorsement from someone doesn't mean I accept them. It means
they're accepting me, but I haven't heard anything about it.''

   Democratic leaders Thursday accused
Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of accepting ``scum money'' from
race track interests to buy campaign ads defending his record as
governor.
   Jeffrey Neubauer, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin,
said he was referring to the more than $280,000 the Thompson
campaign is reported to have received from investors in Wisconsin
dog tracks.
   ``He sold his soul to raise historic amounts of scum money,''
said Neubauer. ``You can buy a lot of deception with scum money.''
   The chairman and Democratic Assembly leaders held a Capitol news
conference to blast Thompson's campaign ads, particularly one that
accused the Legislature of blocking property tax relief proposals.
   ``The governor's trying to redirect the blame'' for the lack of
property tax relief, Neubauer said. ``He's attempting to do it with
money that was raised in an unethical fashion.''
   Neither Thompson nor his campaign director, Scott Jensen, was

   U.S. Sen. Carl Levin has a substantial lead over
U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette, while Gov. James Blanchard has stretched

Opinion Research for the Detroit Free Press and television stations
WDIV and WXYZ. Schuette was favored by 27 percent, with 5 percent
undecided. The telephone poll conducted Sept. 21-23 has a margin of
error of 3.5 percentage points.
   The poll also showed Democrat Blanchard with an advantage over
Engler in the gubernatorial campaign, 55 percent to 35 percent,
with 5 percent undecided.
   In August, a similar poll showed Blanchard with a 13-point lead.

<HEAD>Officials Say Only Insider Could Topple Saddam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's security
shield is so thick and mobile that the only way he'll be toppled is
if one of his intimate advisers turns against him, U.S. officials
said Thursday.
   Based on reports from Iraq, the officials said they've concluded
that Saddam remains in Baghdad but moves around frequently from his
various palaces in the capital.
   The officials spoke on condition they remain anonymous.
   ``He is moving around a lot,'' one official said. Saddam's
houses are ``well-defended and structurally strong'' and he is
taken from place to place usually in a heavily secured convoy.
   Saddam's whereabouts and his habits have been somewhat of a
mystery since he ordered his troops to invade Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Before the invasion, Saddam was a visible leader, making
frequent public appearances at mosques and schools. But he has been
in virtual seclusion since the invasion, apparently because he
fears for his safety. His pronouncements are usually by his
spokesman on television.
   ``Saddam is alive, well and breathing,'' said an official.
   Various visitors have seen him recently, including the Mooccan
foreign minister and Palestinian officials.
   But Saddam, who has been the target of 11 assassination attempts
in the last 13 years, apparently only deals face-to-face with a
handful of close advisers.
   Among them are Taha Yasin Ramadan, the first deputy prime
minister, and Latif Nasuayyif Jasim, the minister of culture and
information.
   Were Saddam to be assassinated, the plotters ``would have to be
senior enough to get through the security,'' the official said.
``It would have to happen very fast. ... They would have to go
directly to Saddam.''
   But the officials said the top advisers ``keep each other in
sight'' to ensure none of them disappears.
   ``They know if one is missing what that means,'' the official
said.
   Saddam has a history of ruthlessness; he once shot to death a
health minister who disagreed with him.
   ``He doesn't allow a whiff of opposition,'' an official said.
   Saddam's security apparatus is awesome. It is comprised of
various forces, many of them controlled by Saddam's relatives. He
also has the elite Revolutionary Guards numbering about 100,000.
   The officials said they believe Saddam's conspiratorial
tendencies have been heightened by the gulf crisis.
   ``He is obviously spending a lot of time thinking about his
security,'' one official said.
   At the same time, government officials are unsure how Saddam is
filtering information he receives from the West. Their assessment
is that he's prepared ``for what he sees as an inevitable battle''
over Kuwait but is unwilling to provoke war.
   Despite the hardships he has inflicted on his country, internal
opposition to Saddam remains limited, the officials said.
Dissidents either don't exist or they have been silenced through
death or exile.
   The Kurds, a mountain people who seek independence from Iraq,
were brought to heel when the Iraqis resettled thousands of them in
a desert area and used chemical gas against others.
   There have been unconfirmed reports U.S. intelligence is helping
the Kurds. But U.S. officials said any anti-Saddam sentiment had
been hushed.
   ``We don't see any signs of dissidents,'' said an official.
   The officials also cautioned against underestimating Saddam's
appeal to his people.
   ``He is not unpopular,'' said the official, noting that the
Iraqi president has managed to improve his people's standard of
living, feed them and instill in them a sense of national pride.
   ``He is not a Ceausescu,'' the official said, referring to
Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian president who was executed in
December after being toppled.

   A ``deranged'' Iranian gunman with a
hatred of blond Americans died in a burst of police bullets
Thursday, seven hours after he stormed a bar, killed one man,
wounded seven people and took 33 hostages.
   Six officers stormed Henry's Publick House and Grille in the
Durant Hotel after police negotiators decided they couldn't talk
the gunman out of the bar, said Lt. Jim Polk.
   ``We decided there was no other way,'' said Polk.
   He said the gunman, identified by University of California,
Berkeley, spokesman Ray Colvig as Mehrdad Dashti, gave away his
position inside the bar by using one of the terrorized hostages as
an intermediary in talking to police by telephone.
   ``Every time the hostage would have to ask a question of this
bad guy, he would have to turn around and look at him and this gave
us a good idea of where he was,'' said Polk.
   Seconds after the burst of police gunfire around 7:20 a.m.,
hostages, some of whom had been forced to sit in the windows of the
bar as shields, ran from the hotel.
   Dashti, 30, a native of Iran, was naked and bleeding when he was
loaded into an ambulance and taken to Highland Hospital. He was
dead on arrival, according to hospital spokeswomen Phyllis Brown.
   ``He was apparently very confused,'' said Berkeley Police Capt.
Phil Doran. ``Deranged is not a bad description.''
   ``For some reason, he had something against blonds, Caucasian
women and blond-haired, blue-eyed men,'' said Douglas Moore, 25, a
UC student and manager of the bar who was one of the hostages. ``He
had something against Americans.''
   ``He accused the women of showing too much leg,'' Moore said.
``He accused them of wearing tight skirts, short skirts ...
   ``He said it was that kind of trash that was leading guys like
him on and that they deserved to be punished. ... He did a pretty
good job of degrading the women.''
   Mayor Loni Hancock said women hostages were sexually abused, but
wouldn't give details.
   Moore, however, said no one was sexually abused.
   Moore said Dashti claimed the ``government owed him $16 trillion
for mental telepathy work and this was his way of getting it
back.''
   San Francisco Police Sgt. Jerry Senkir said Dashti was named in
a warrant charging grand theft in connection with cashing two
stolen checks worth more than $16,000. He said Dashti had been
advised of the charges and police expected him to turn himself in.
   One of Dashti's demands was that San Francisco Police Chief
Frank Jordan appear live on television and ``drop his drawers,''
according to Doran.
   Doran said one of Dashti's complaints was that ``he didn't get a
student loan.''
   The English pub-style bar, a popular student hangout one block
from the UC campus, was crowded when the gunman rushed inside,
witnesses said. Several escaped soon after the standoff began,
police said.
   Dashti shot six people after entering, said Doran. Police
reported another two people were shot during another round of
gunfire about three hours later.
   Moore said John Sheehy, 22, of Lafayette, was shot in the chest
at close range early in the incident. Sheehy, a UC student, died
during surgery, said Thomas McGarry, a spokesman at Eden Hospital
in Castro Valley.
   Witnesses said the shooting was punctuated by the gunman
screaming, ``When is it going to end? How long? How long?''
   Frederick Smith, 19, a UC junior from Los Angeles and Dashti's
roommate for a month, said Dashti grew up in Iran and moved to this
country about eight years ago. He said Dashti was a gun collector
and had given Smith shooting lessons.
   Smith said Dashti told him Wednesday that Smith would have to
move out because Dashti was flying to Hawaii to meet a woman his
parents had arranged for him to marry.
   Smith said Dashti had earned an engineering degree from San
Francisco State University but couldn't find a job.
   The apartment they shared was cluttered with family photographs,
ammunition, drab furniture and bookshelves crowded with books. One
document found in the apartment, a form from the Alameda County
Department of Health Services, described him as a paranoid
schizophrenic.
   Two of the wounded were in guarded condition with multiple
bullet wounds, two were being treated for leg wounds, and three
were treated and released, hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Barry Bows to Key Student Demand, but Protest Continues at UDC</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry, bowing to a chief demand
of students occupying two buildings at the University of the
District of Columbia, said Thursday he will ask 10 of the school's
15 trustees to resign.
   However, the mayor added that he is powerless to force anyone on
the trustee board to quit.
   ``We had a good dialogue, a good session,'' the mayor said after
emerging from a 4{-hour meeting with students who have occupied the
two buildings at the city-run university. ``I told them I'd give it
my best shot.''
   The 200 students continued their protest, meanwhile, with
another meeting with Barry planned for Friday.
   ``We had a very productive meeting with Mayor Barry,'' said
Aisha Murray, a protest leader. ``We are searching for quality
education.''
   The demonstrators are seeking a number of changes at the school,
including a restructured board. Chairwoman Nira Long is among those
whose resignation they have demanded.
   The school's faculty senate, which has disagreed with the
school's administration on a number of issues in recent years,
backed the students - who also want an improved athletic program,
compliance with education standards set by a regional accreditation
board, and an increased emphasis on an AfricanAAmerican curriculum.
   ``The faculty leadership is in general supportive of the demands
made by the students,'' said Prof. Emanuel Chatman in a letter
signed by other faculty senate members. ``Over the past several
years, the board of trustees of the University of the District of
Columbia have often acted in a manner contrary to the best
interests of the university.''
   Under city law, trustees are approved by the city council but
cannot be forced to resign. The positions are not salaried, but
board members are paid on a per-diem basis and reimbursed for
expenses. They cannot collect more than $4,000 per year.
   University officials canceled classes on Thursday, but gave no
word on whether instruction would resume Friday.

   A Navy submarine recovered part of the cargo
door that broke away from a United jetliner over the Pacific last
year, sweeping nine people to their death, authorities said
Thursday.
   The crew of a deep-sea submarine retrieved the lower half of the
hatch from the ocean floor and located what is believed to be the
door's upper half, a Navy spokeswoman said.
   United Airlines Flight 811 had just taken off from Honolulu
International Airport when the door and a large chunk of fuselage
tore away at 22,000 feet.
   The piece was found late Wednesday in 14,100 feet of water 90
miles south-southwest of here, said Lt. Cmdr. Sandy Stairs, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   The 31-foot submarine Sea Cliff videotaped the 6-by-10-foot
piece on the ocean floor and brought it to the surface with its
hydraulic jaws, Stairs said. It was brought onto the deck of the
Navy vessel the Laney Choust at about midnight Wednesday.
   During the 18-hour dive Wednesday, the submarine's three-man
crew believed it also found the upper half of the cargo door about
200 yards away from where the lower half was found. Stairs said the
submarine planned to dive again Thursday night to examine the
debris, which was spotted as a strong sonar contact.
   The National Transportation Safety Board called for the search
in hopes that examining the door will lead to better aviation
safety rules.
   In Washington, the safety board said a preliminary examination
by one of its investigators showed the door had fractured
longitudinally near the midspan latch. The eight sectors of the
latch lock were all in the locked position and were deformed.
   After investigators examine the recovered debris, parts of it
will be sent to the Boeing Co. in Seattle for a more detailed
review under board direction, NTSB officials said.
   If the submarine is able to retrieve the top half of the door,
the Sea Cliff and its support ship are expected to return to Pearl
Harbor late Friday or early Saturday.
   The jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it took off for New
Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Shortly after takeoff, the cargo door opened at 22,000 feet.
Nine passengers were swept out of the plane and five others
suffered serious injuries. The crew managed to return the jet to
Honolulu.
   The NTSB inquiry determined that faulty design of a locking
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the
door was locked.
   The agency blamed United, Boeing and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to correct problems with the door.
   Debris from the jet was located in July by a sonar-scanning sled
that can spot metallic objects over wide areas.
   Markings on debris found on several dives indicate it is from a
Boeing 747, Stairs said.
   She said the debris also included pieces of fuselage and window
frames with ``747'' written on them.

<HEAD>Man Who Killed Wife 14 Years Ago Sentenced to Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who lived as a fugitive for nearly 14
years after stabbing his wife to death and dismembering her body
was sentenced Thursday to six to 18 years in prison.
   ``I'm sorry for the crime,'' said Fred Weldon, who had pleaded
guilty to first-degree manslaughter. ``I'd like to pay my debt to
society.''
   Weldon disappeared the day after the headless, handless body of
his wife, Norma, 29, was found in Harlem's Mount Morris Park on
Dec. 20, 1976. Police say the woman was slain during an argument
three days before.
   Weldon, 50, initially fled to the Central America country of
Belize but returned to New York and worked for years at a print
shop. Detectives arrested him there in August after checking his
income tax returns, which he had filed under his own name.
   Weldon had also remarried and lived with his wife, Celestine,
and a 10-year-old son who suffers from cerebral palsy.
   He was originally charged with second-degree murder and could
have been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
   Assistant District Attorney Harvey Rosen said prosecutors
allowed Weldon to plead guilty to manslaughter because the case had
been weakened by the passage of time. He said some evidence had
been lost or destroyed and some witnesses were no longer available.
   Weldon worried that he would never see his son again if he were
convicted of the more serious charge, said his lawyer, Eugene
Kaplan.
   ``He's a better person now,'' Kaplan said.

<HEAD>Plan Would Allow Tripling of Strategic Reserve Sale</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman moved Thursday
to allow a tripling of President Bush's first oil sale from the
government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The move came after Energy Secretary James Watkins said the
planned 5-million-barrel sale would have no significant effect on
gasoline prices.
   Bush ordered the test sale Wednesday, with his spokesman saying
it was intended in part as a ``signal'' to quell speculation in the
oil markets and halt skyrocketing crude prices.
   On Thursday, however, prices shot up briefly to above $40 a
barrel for the first time on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Watkins, meanwhile, told the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on energy and power that the administration ``has no
expectation that it (the sale) is going to have any significant
long-term market impact.''
   ``But we're not going into this test with the idea that it's
going to bring the cost down $8 a barrel or something,'' he said.
``That's not the purpose. If Saddam Hussein makes another threat,
the market could jump again regardless of the test sale.''
   Watkins told the panel the 5 million barrel test sale, which was
authorized by Congress two weeks ago, was too small to indicate how
the government's 590-million-barrel stockpile might fit into the
world oil market if Bush should decide to order an actual emergency
drawdown.
   ``This is not a drawdown,'' he emphasized, adding that the test
will ``give us optimum readiness to open the spigot if that is
required in the future.''
   Recalling that the administration just two weeks ago threatened
to veto a larger test sale, Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind. and the
subcommittee chairman, asked Watkins how large a test he would
like.
   ``Three times the (5 million) number is the number,'' Watkins
replied.
   ``We welcome the change,'' said Sharp, who had his staff draft a
bill authorizing a new test sale of 15 million barrels and gather
the signatures of several other committee members on it while
Watkins was testifying. Anticipating no opposition in the Senate,
Sharp said the bill could be on Bush's desk for his signature in
two week.
   Bid notices on the 5 million barrel test will be sent out
Friday; the Energy Department expects to award sale contracts in
mid-October.
   Bob Porter, a department spokesman, said an average of 167,000
barrels of oil - far short of the 500,000 barrels that analysts say
is needed to drive prices down - will be released daily for 30
days.
   Lawmakers including Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas urged
Bush for more than a month to tap the reserve to stem the runup in
oil prices since Iraq's takeover of Kuwait Aug. 2 and the
subsequent embargo removing about 4.3 million barrels daily from
the world market.
   Watkins said Thursday that ``U.S. crude stocks are above normal
as of the moment, but they could go below normal by the end of
October.
   ``We are concerned about the ability of refiners to continue
operating as they have been at near-maximum capacity. With our
system so fully utilized, we are more vulnerable to accidents,
transportation problems or bad weather.''
   The U.S. stockpile, stored in salt caverns along the
Louisiana-Texas coast, is capable of pumping up to 3.5 million
barrels a day.
   The White House, meanwhile, shrugged off the fact that oil
prices rose Thursday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with Bush in Cleveland
for a Republican fund-raising speech, said driving down world oil
prices was not Bush's purpose for taking the action.
   ``In the president's mind, it was the unfairness issue,''
Fitzwater said.
   On Wednesday, the spokesman said he expected lower prices would
be one effect of the president's action. He would not repeat that
characterization Thursday.

<HEAD>Lithuanian, Soviet Officials to Discuss Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and
Lithuanian officials have agreed to meet next week for long-awaited
talks on the Baltic republic's drive for independence, news
agencies reported Thursday.
   Both sides declined to term Tuesday's meeting at the Kremlin
``negotiations'' or ``consultations,'' the official news agency
Tass and Baltic news organizations said.
   Lithuania announced its independence March 11, but agreed to
suspend the declaration in exchange for the lifting of an oil and
natural gas embargo imposed by President Mikhail Gorbachev in May.
Lithuanian officials also called for negotiations with the national
government.
   Talks between officials of another breakaway Baltic state,
Estonia, and the Soviet parliament were suspended Sept. 6 after the
Soviet side announced it had no authority to engage in
``negotiations.''
   Agreement on the Lithuania meeting came Thursday in a phone
conversation between Ryzhkov and Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene, the Estonian News Service and Lithuanian news
agency Elta reported.
   Ms. Prunskiene and other Lithuanian officials had earlier
accused the Kremlin of stalling on talks.
   Lithuania's eight-member delegation to the meeting will be led
by its president, Vytautas Landsbergis. Ryzhkov is to head the
Soviet team.
   Lithuania, Estonia and the third Baltic republic, Latvia, are
refusing to take part in negotiations with Soviet officials on a
new union treaty.
   Gorbachev met Thursday with Latvian Prime Minister Ivars
Godmanis and stated that ``the people of Latvia should themselves
choose between two ways of developing relations with the Soviet
Union - the Latvian republic as a member of a union of sovereign
states, or the Latvian republic as an independent state outside the
Soviet Union,'' Tass reported.
   Gorbachev sugggested Latvians hold a referendum on the issue,
said Tass, citing Latvian government officials.
   Tass also reported Thursday that the Soviet prosecutor's office
declared illegal a decision by Latvia's parliament to appoint and
control its own prosecutor and deputies. The Soviet prosecutor's
office said its appointees will continue to work in Latvia.

   Two infertility clinics charged by the Federal
Trade Commission with misrepresenting success rates have agreed not
to make such claims in the future, the FTC announced Thursday.
   One of the clinics, IVF Australia, one of the largest providers
of fertility services in the United States, said its claims were
not inaccurate but may have been hard to understand.
   ``We have always provided the public with accurate
information,'' said Vicki Baldwin, a founding director of the firm,
in a news release issued from its headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``We do agree that some prospective patients may have found our
success rate reports difficult to interpret,'' Ms. Baldwin said.
``Thus, in cooperation with the Federal Trade Commission, we have
revised our materials to improve clarity.''
   The cases involve in vitro fertilization (IVF) services, in
which the sperm and the egg are joined together in the laboratory
instead of naturally in the womb of the mother.
   IVF Australia offers medical services at United Hospital, Port
Chester, N.Y., Waltham Weston Hospital and Medical Center in
Waltham, Mass., and at a clinic in Mineola, N.Y.
   The other clinic involved is the West Boca Medical Center in
Boca Raton, Fla.
   Sid Tyler, executive vice president of NME Hospital Group in
Santa Monica, Calif., operator of the Florida clinic, said, ``We
don't agree completely with the FTC on this, but nonetheless we
have agreed with the consent order and we are certainly going to
comply with the request that they have made that any statistical
comparisons or statistical claims that we make ...are done
comparably to similar national data so that we are talking about
apples and apples.''
   The FTC invited public comment on the consent agreements with
the clinics and noted that the allegations do not concern the
quality of the services provided.
   ``These two cases will provide important guidance to a growing
industry about the support necessary to make valid success rate
claims,'' Gloria Cordes Larson, deputy director of the commission's
Bureau of Consumer Protection, said.
   The commission said infertility affects one in six U.S. couples.
   IVF Australia advertised in newspapers and magazines that ``more
than 28 percent of the couples who complete a cycle of treatment
are becoming pregnant'' and that ``one out of three couples who
complete a cycle of treatment is becoming pregnant.''
   A brochure sent to prospective patients said, ``Our experience
indicates that when a patient at an IVF Australia program completes
four IVF treatment cycles, the chance of giving birth is about 50
percent.''
   The FTC said these claims misled consumers by overstating the
likelihood of achieving either a live birth or a pregnancy. It said
a significant number of unsuccessful outcomes were excluded from
the calculation used to determine success.
   The consent order requires IVF Australia to include in its
calculations all patients who begin the program.
   The complaint against the Boca Raton clinic charges that it
advertised in local newspapers and national magazines that ``four
of our first 12 patients participating in our In Vitro
Fertilization program have achieved pregnancy'' and that ``our
success rate is an impressive 30 percent, well above the national
average.''
   It said these determinations were based entirely on a chemical
test, which should have been subjected to confirmation by an
ultrasound, or sonogram, test and was not.
   The commission said its order provided that in making future
claims the clinic ``must use the same tests that the other success
rates use.''
   The agreement are open for public comment for 60 days, after
which the commission will decide whether to make them final.
   Final consent orders do not involve admission of a law violation
but carry the force of law with respect to future actions. Each
violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to
$10,000.

<HEAD>Fleeing Subway Mugger Dies on Third Rail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A young man found electrocuted on the third rail
in a subway yard is almost certainly the mugger who attacked a
woman on a train and fled from a group of men who cornered him,
police said Thursday.
   The man's name has not been established but witnesses have
identified him as the mugger, Transit Police Sgt. Robert Valentino
said.
   A wallet grabbed from the mugger Tuesday night by his temporary
captors contained $22 and an identity card of Jean Carlos Pabain
Perez, 22. But investigators found no trace of any such person at
the address given, Valentino said.
   The mugging occurred on a northbound No. 6 train that had just
left a station in the Bronx.
   The victim handed over her purse when the mugger put a knife to
her face. The thief also cut her watch from her wrist and ran from
the train at the Middletown Road station.
   His victim followed him and screamed to a group of bystanders,
who grabbed the thief. They pulled off his shirt and got his
wallet, but he broke free and eluded his pursuers by running into a
nearby train yard.
   About 40 minutes later police found a shirtless man fitting the
mugger's description dead against the 600-volt third rail.
   Neither the mugger's knife nor the woman's purse and watch has
been recovered, Valentino said.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Hopes to End Investigation by Spring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra special prosecutor indicated
Thursday that he may seek more indictments but expressed
determination to conclude the investigation by next spring.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said his office is
reviewing recently obtained records of the Iran-Contra affair and
questioning previously unavailable witnesses as prosecutors work to
conclude the nearly four-year-old investigation.
   In remarks prepared for delivery Thursday in Topeka, Kan., Walsh
said he would not make a decision about closing down his office
until after an appeals court reviews the convictions of former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Poindexter is appealing his six-month sentence for obstructing
congressional inquiries about covert military aid to Nicaraguan
rebels and the sale of arms to Iran. A decision on Poindexter's
appeal of five felony convictions is not expected until spring.
   ``Ideally, the work of the office, except for possible appeals
and the trial of any outstanding indictments - should be concluded
after this decision,'' Walsh said.
   ``During the intervening months, our investigation should be
completed,'' Walsh said in the speech at Washburn University.
   Walsh's remarks indicated that his original timetable for
closing down the investigation had slipped at least six more
months.
   Following Poindexter's conviction in April, Walsh said he hoped
to decide by this fall on whether to conclude the investigation.
   Since his appointment in late 1986, Walsh has obtained eight
convictions of Iran-Contra figures, including Poindexter and former
White House aide Oliver L. North.
   In his speech, Walsh held out the possibility of more
indictments from a grand jury that sources say is continuing to
investigate the role of Reagan administration officials in covering
up the affair.
   But Walsh said his efforts will be largely focused on defending
the convictions of North and Poindexter in appellate courts.
   North's convictions were set aside in July by a federal appeals
court panel that ordered a hearing to determine if references to
testimony that he gave Congress under a grant of immunity seeped
into his trial.
   Walsh is asking the appellate court to reconsider its decision.
   Poindexter, who also testified before Congress under a limited
immunity grant, is expected to raise the same issues on his appeal
of a six-month sentence for obstructing congressional inquiries and
lying to lawmakers about covert military aid to the Nicaraguan
Contras and the sale of arms to Iran.
   With the Sept. 18 tax-evasion conviction of Thomas Clines, a
former CIA agent who helped broker U.S.-Iran arms sales, Walsh has
no pending indictments to prepare for trial.
   ``All of our efforts can be devoted to pending appeals and
remaining areas of investigation,'' Walsh said. ``Even at this late
date, some records have only recently come into our possession.''
   Walsh did not describe the records or identify previously
unavailable witnesses who are now being questioned. But he appeared
to be referring to North and Poindexter, who have both appeared as
witnesses before the grand jury that meets periodically to take
testimony.
   ``As court proceedings are being concluded, our remaining
investigation will be completed,'' Walsh said. ``If there should be
further prosecutions, they will be pressed without delay.''
   The continuing expense of the investigation, which has cost more
than $21 million, ``must also be considered in connection with any
extension of activities.''
   The prosecutor blamed delays in his investigation on the
decision by Congress to force Poindexter and North to testify under
immunity grants that barred prosecutors from using theirtestimony
as evidence.
   The grants ``doubled the time taken from indictment to final
disposition'' because it forced the court to try North and
Poindexter separately, Walsh said.

Drug</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities dismissed hundreds of drug
cases Thursday, saying they couldn't be prosecuted because the
city's former police chief stole the evidence to support his
cocaine habit.
   ``It's basically the loss of two years' work,'' Plymouth County
District Attorney William O'Malley said. ``It all goes down the
drain.''
   About 380 cases were dismissed in Plymouth Superior Court and
District Court.
   ``The overwhelming majority of these cases would have resulted
in convictions if it weren't for these problems,'' O'Malley said.
   He said some of the defendants can still be prosecuted on other
charges, however.
   Former Police Chief Richard J. Sproules pleaded guilty in June
to stealing large amounts of cash and cocaine from the police
department's evidence room dating back to 1984. He also pleaded
guilty to two counts of intimidating witnesses.
   He was ordered to serve at least two years and four months in
state prison.
   Authorities said Sproules took about $170,000 from the evidence
room, but returned $25,000 he had hidden in his cellar.
   Sproules, 46, said he used cocaine every day for five years
after trying some of the samples he took to anti-drug lectures.
   The drug ``possessed me like a demon,'' Sproules said.

   Rep. Bruce Vento of the House Banking
Committee introduced legislation Thursday designed to outlaw a
Republican fund-raising tactic he says is deceptive.
   Earlier this year, the National Republican Senatorial Committee
sent $25 checks to a million prospective contributors. Fine print
on the back of the checks, if they are endorsed, authorizes the GOP
committee to deduct $12.50 a month from recipients' checking
accounts.
   Vento's Account Fraud and Deception Prevention Act would amend
the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to ensure that the endorsement,
cashing or deposit of a check cannot be used to authorize automatic
withdrawals from a checking account.
   ``If left unchecked this new bait-and-hook gimmick will become
the scam artist dream of the '90s,'' Vento, D-Minn., said in a
statement.
   Democratic attorneys general in Alabama and Illinois have filed
suit to stop the Republican committee's solicitation. Republican
attorneys general in Wisconsin and Oregon and the Democratic
attorney general in Minnesota have said they were investigating the
tactic.
   Wendy Burnley, a spokeswoman for the Republic committee, had no
comment on the bill. But she said the fund-raising letter
accompanying the checks clearly explained that endorsing them would
authorize automatic withdrawals.
   She said that only the first two withdrawals were mandatory and
that further withdrawals could be stopped at any time and that a
full refund could be obtained by calling a toll-free number
provided in the letter.
   However, some recipients have complained that they did not
realize they were authorizing deductions.
   Vento said he hoped to move the bill, which has six Democratic
co-sponsors, before Congress adjourns next month.
   ``It is imperative that we close the door before any more bogus
checks are foisted on the American people,'' he said.
   Burnley said the Republican committee has agreed to meet with
state officials objecting to the solicitations, but not until after
the election.
   ``There are some places where this has become highly
politicized,'' she said.

   Patsy Mink, who served in Congress from 1965

   The 62-year-old Mink, a Democrat, said she was honored ``once

   Mink was elected Saturday in a special election to fill out the

<HEAD>Police Defuse Bomb Found at Conference on Terrorism in London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Thursday defused a bomb planted in a
lunch box that had been taped to a lectern at a conference on
terrorism in central London.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad, said the device contained enough plastic
explosives to kill and was probably put there by the Irish
Republican Army.
   But no group immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb,
found in the Royal Overseas League building on Park Place in the
Piccadilly section in the center of London.
   A sound engineer checking the public address system before the
start of the conference found a plastic lunch box taped to the
lectern at 9:30 a.m., police and television crews covering the
conference said.
   Anti-terrorist squad officers defused the bomb, which was
scheduled to go off an hour later, police said. The conference was
to have begun 30 minutes earlier, at 10 a.m.
   Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave was to have been the
first speaker, but a change in his appointments forced a
last-minute schedule switch and he was moved back to 3:30 p.m.
   Churchill-Coleman said he did not believe that Waldegrave or
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert, also scheduled
to speak at the one-day conference organized by the Research
Institute for the Study of Conflict and Terrorism, were the
targets.
   ``The conference, which was widely advertised, would be seen as
a legitimate target by Irish Republican terrorist groups,'' he
said.
   Scotland Yard said police had found nothing in a comprehensive
search of the building at 6 a.m.
   Independent Television News sound engineer Pat Hillyard said he
noticed the conference sound engineer trying to fit the top on the
lectern.
   ``He found out that what was stopping him from fixing the top of
the lectern was the package,'' Hillyard said. ``They looked at it
and asked if anybody was responsible for putting it inside. We said
it was nothing to do with us.
   ``They realized quickly that it was something suspect and got us
out quickly - within a minute,'' Hillyard said.
   The building and others nearby were evacuated, the conference
abandoned and police closed off busy central London streets while
they searched for a second device.
   Churchill-Coleman said it was a sophisticated terrorist device
that would have been activated by a timer.
   ``It did contain sufficient high explosive that, had the device
exploded, which we believe would have been about 10.30 this
morning, it would have caused death and serious injury.
   ``It would have killed the speaker and other people as well,''
he said.
   The IRA has targeted government officials and security forces in
its fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Professor Richard Shultz of Tufts University in Boston, who was
scheduled to address the conference on American views of terrorism,
said there had been an ``embarrassing security lapse.''
   ``I am not happy with this, but if someone got through it was a
fairly sophisticated move because there were a lot of people
around,'' Shultz said.

<TEXT>
   Pound the kettle drums and sound a fanfare: The
world-renowned Chicago Symphony Orchestra is opening its 100th
season as director and Grammy king Sir Georg Solti begins his
triumphant farewell.
   Thursday's season-opening performance at Orchestra Hall begins a
year of programs featuring some of the orchestra's greatest
triumphs.
   Included will be Paul Duakas' ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,''
which Chicago introduced to this country in 1899. It was
incorporated 40 years later into the soundtrack of the Disney film
classic ``Fantasia.''
   Solti, winner of a record 29 Grammy Awards - 23 for Chicago
Symphony recordings and six for other works - will retire next fall
after 22 seasons with the orchestra. Daniel Barenboim was named two
years ago as his eventual successor, although Solti will return as
a guest conductor at least once a year.
   The 77-year-old maestro told a news conference Thursday it is
``wonderfully appropriate'' that his final year as conductor is
also the orchestra's centennial.
   ``If you have to leave your family, this is the moment to leave
it in,'' Solti said in his thick Hungarian accent.
   After more than two decades of globe-trotting with the
orchestra, Solti said, ``what probably pleases me more than
anything else is that we have never had any major disagreements. I
never had to raise my voice.''
   Solti, who took over in 1968, said he selected 66 of the
orchestra's 105 musicians. By that measure, it truly is Solti's
band.
   But the Chicago Symphony Orchestra also belongs to the world.
Critics rank it among the world's finest, and its recordings with
Solti are consistently best-sellers in the classical category.
   In the early years under Solti, the orchestra was still the butt
of Chicago gangster jokes: Were those really violins in their
instrument cases?
   But the orchestra may be best known today for its virtuoso
performances of Gustav Mahler's long, wide-ranging symphonies.
   Thursday's program included Mahler's Symphony No. 5, which was
both the first piece the Solti-led orchestra performed at Carnegie
Hall in 1970 and the first symphony they recorded together.
   ``I suppose it became a hit, using this nice American slang,''
Solti said. He said its inclusion would make the opening-night
performance ``a very sentimental occasion.''
   David Stearns, classical music critic for USA Today, said the
orchestra means Mahler to many but that its trademark is its
versatility.
   ``Under Solti it's like a big, gleaming Rolls-Royce, polished
within an inch of its life. It's aggressive, it's commanding,''
Stearns said in a telephone interview from New York City. ``Under
Barenboim it's softer and more voluptuous because that's
Barenboim's style.''
   And always, Stearns said, the orchestra is unfailingly
professional: ``There is a certain standard under which they will
not fall.''
   Solti said he told his musicians much the same thing when
rehearsals for the centennial season began in the summer.
   ``I told them that what distinguishes you above all orchestras
is the spirit of the music you make under any circumstances. That
distinguishes you above all others.''

   President Bush monitored budget negotiations
from afar on Thursday as he repeated to Republican fund-raising
audiences a message not usually heard from incumbent politicians:
how bad things could get.
   Bush has been painting a nightmarish picture of what will happen
to government services beginning Monday in the absence of a budget
agreement as he winds up a tour that is raising $4 million for
Republican candidates in Ohio, Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan.
   No matter that Bush himself - who convened the so-called budget
summit last spring - is far from the bargaining table. He has been
blaming Democrats for the failure to move the talks along.
   He also suggests that, when his presence is needed, he'll join
the talks.
   At a Cleveland luncheon for GOP gubernatorial candidate George
Voinovich, Bush said automatic budget cuts would mean an end to
federal clean-up of toxic waste sites.
   Later, at a Detroit fundraiser, Bush said that in Michigan ``the
Social Security office will be closed on Friday'' and
``investigations of white collar criminals will drop by 25
percent.''
   ``Congress has got to stop beign manic-depressive,'' he added in
prepared remarks. ``Manic on spending, depressive for the
economy.''
   Earlier Thursday, he told a Minneapolis breakfast for GOP
gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth that many of ``Minnesota's
spectacular parks'' would close and there would be Head Start
teachers ``who can't go to work.''
   And, Bush said, ``there may be senior citizens wondering why
their Social Security checks are late.''
   The night before, in Chicago, he raised every travelers' worst
fears: the specter of ``untold hours of flight delays'' at busy
O'Hare Airport.
   And, in Akron, Ohio, he told an audience that under budget cuts,
poor kids would not be able to attend Akron University.
   ``Four days from now, the fiscal year ends and still no budget
agreement,'' Bush told his Cleveland audience, calling the impasse
in Washington a ``fiscal fiasco.''
   The last thing the nation needs, he added, ``is a budget
breakdown that puts them on the road to recession.''
   Administration officials said privately that a budget accord
seemed to be near. One official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that a pact seemed likely by the weekend.
   Their new optimism matched expressions of optimism voiced by
congressional budget negotiators.
   Some Democrats have said that the president's criticism of
Democrats from the campaign trail hasn't helped the negotiating
process.
   Even so, Bush on Thursday told his Minnesota audience, ``I hope
there will be the compromise needed to help this country from
coming to a screeching halt.''

<HEAD>Jury Awards Comic $725,000 in Suit Against Caesars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rodney Dangerfield was awarded $725,000 on
Thursday by jury that believed the comedian's eye problems were
caused by a steam bath accident at Caesars Palace.
   Dangerfield sued the casino-hotel for $5 million after Caesars
balked at paying him for shows he missed after he claimed he was
burned in a steam bath in March 1988.
   ``We showed Rodney some respect,'' an unidentified juror said
after Dangerfield thanked jurors as they left U.S. District Court.
   The jury deliberated less than a day before awarding Dangerfield
$225,000 for five missed performances and $500,000 for pain and
suffering.
   The jury ruled that Dangerfield's contract obligated Caesars to
pay for the missed shows because the injury should have excused him
from performing. It rejected a $100,000 countersuit filed by
Caesars against its former headliner.
   ``The truth won out,'' said Dangerfield. He decried as
``nonsense and untrue'' Caesars' accusations that he used drugs.
   ``I'm surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely
like they did,'' Dangerfield said. ``All they did in this entire
trial was to try to degrade my character.
   ``I wasn't concerned with the amount of money,'' he said.
``Money is money. I was concerned about the truth. I was right. I
wouldn't have gone through this unless I was right.''
   Dangerfield said Henry Gluck, chairman of the resort's parent
Caesars World Inc., had refused an offer to settle for $225,000.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Bruce Aguilera, attorney for
the casino. ``We'll have to have our lawyers look at the case.
   Dangerfield sought $5 million in damages plus $45,000 for each
show he missed the week of the accident, claiming Caesars was
negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath.
   The hotel, in its countersuit, accused Dangerfield of breaching
his contract and contended during the 2{-week-long trial that the
comedian did not suffer permanent damage.
   The 68-year-old comic testified he was hit in the eyes by a
burst of steam as he opened the door to the steam room on March 16,
1988.
   He skipped four performances, then returned for two shows but
walked off the stage without performing on closing night because he
was angry that Caesars wanted to withhold payment for the missed
shows.
   Caesars claimed Dangerfield went out on the town two nights that
he claimed he was too hurt to perform. A doctor who examined him
after the incident said that Dangerfield could have performed.
Other eye specialists testified for the casino-hotel that symptoms
Dangerfield claimed to suffer only since the accident actually
first appeared in the 1970s.
   However, an eye doctor who has examined Dangerfield three times
in the last year testified that he continues to suffer pain from
the steam injury.

   Militiamen of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army killed two guerrillas Thursday after they infiltrated
into Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon,
police said.
   They said the shooting occurred on a dirt road between the
villages of Shomarieh and Deir Semaan near Marjayoun, provincial
capital of the 350-square-mile zone.
   The National Resistence Front, a coalition of 12 pro-Syrian
Lebanese leftist factions and radical Palestinian groups, claimed
the attack in a communique issued in Beirut.
   The communique claimed the guerrillas engaged Israeli troops and
SLA militiamen in a three-hour battle in the Marjayoun area,
destroying an Israeli tank and an SLA armored personnel carrier.
   ``At least 15 enemy soldiers and militiamen were either killed
or wounded in the clash,'' the communique said. It did not mention
the front's casualties.
   Police in Hasbaya, one of the closest Lebanese towns to the
security zone, said they could not confirm that Israeli troops were
involved in the clash.
   Israel carved out the enclave in 1985 to serve as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla forays after withdrawing the bulk of
its army, ending a three-year invasion.
   The enclave, stretching from the Mediterranean coast to the
foothills of Mount Hermon, is patrolled by the 3,000-strong
predominantly Christian SLA and an estimated 1,000 Israeli troops.

   A Mexican teen-ager flew home Thursday with a
new face and a Mickey Mouse cap to replace the ski mask he wore to
hide his disfigurement.
   ``He came in with a mask covering him completely. He's going out
in a baseball cap,'' said Dr. Mutaz Habal, the plastic surgeon who
last month built a new skull and half a face for 18-year-old Pablo
Hernandez-Pina.
   ``Pablo does not look like an animal - he is human now,'' said
his mother, Severiana Hernandez-Pina.
   The young man was so badly deformed, said Habal, that he had his
doubts that he could help him when he heard of the case 18 months
ago. Congenital birth defects left Hernandez-Pina with a severely
disfigured face and cleft palate.
   ``He was what you call a monstrosity,'' the doctor said. ``You
could see how he frightened people. The first time I looked at him
I thought it was probably almost impossible to do.''
   When Hernandez-Pina arrived in Tampa on Aug. 12 he couldn't
close his mouth or eat solid food. He had no nose. His right eye
socket was just above his ear. A large hole in the bone of his
forehead left his brain protected only by a flap of wrinkled skin.
   In a 15-hour operation at St. Joseph's Hospital, Habal and his
team of surgeons cut the teen's scalp from just above one ear to
the top of the other and pulled his face down like a mask.
   Surgeons then moved his right eye socket to the front of his
face and built a nose. They closed a large hole in his skull and
shifted his brain from the oral cavity back into his head. A
section of skull was used to build the teen's forehead and two ribs
were made into cheekbones.
   After the operation, Hernandez-Pina, who had lived only on
goat's milk, tasted his first solid food - chicken, eggs, cookies,
chocolate, spaghetti and french fries.
   ``I liked all of it,'' the shy, slight youngster said through an
interpreter at Habal's office, where he had a final examination
before boarding a flight for central Mexico. The family lives on a
farm in Apaseol Ginade village in Guanajuato province.
   The young man still has a lot of work ahead, said his doctor.
His face is swollen from where the skin was moved, he must learn to
wear an artificial eye and he has been fitted with braces to
straighten his teeth. More surgery may also be needed.
   But hospital officials say his outlook on life has already
changed for the better.
   ``I saw him go from total withdrawal to absolute excitement
after the bandages came off,'' said Karen Parker, director of
surgical services at St. Joseph's. ``He went from following behind
in his mother's shadows with a mask on to running ahead of her
laughing.''

<HEAD>Tass: Soviets Have Joined Interpol; Iraq Attends, Not Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Thursday became a member of
the international police agency Interpol, the official news agency
Tass said.
   In a one-sentence report from Ottawa, Tass said, ``At a session
of the Interpol general assembly that opened here on Thursday, the
Soviet Union became a member of this organization uniting more than
150 countries.''
   But Interpol secretary-general Raymond Kendall was quoted by
Canadian Press as saying the Soviets had applied to join Interpol
and, ``Never in history has an applicant been refused membership.''
   Kendall made his remarks at Thursday's opening of the 59th
general assembly of Interpol where a Soviet delegation is
attending.
   ``By the end of the year, all these countries (in Eastern
Europe) will be in,'' Kendall added.
   Czechoslovakia and Poland, which have emerged over the last year
from Communist rule as new democracies, are joining this year, he
said.
   Yugoslavia, a Communist country not considered part of the
Soviet bloc, is an Interpol member, though Kendall said much of
Eastern Europe has been ``an empty space on the map for us.''
   Would Soviet membership make a difference in the international
battle with crime?
   ``Oh yes,'' Kendall said, mentioning as an example possible drug
routes through countries in which Interpol has had little previous
contact with police.
   About 500 delegates from 150 countries were present for the
opening speech by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney but absent was
Kuwait, which was invaded Aug. 2 and annexed by Iraq.
   Kendall said Kuwait had told Interpol it would attend the
meeting. But an aide was unable to say whether Kuwait's reply to
the invitation had come before or the invasion.
   Both Kuwait and Iraq are Interpol members.
   Delegations were seated alphabetically, with Iraq's Faisal
Hussein, minister-counselor at the Iraq embassy here, next to the
Iranian delegates. The Israeli members were nearby.
   Asked how he felt about Kuwait's possible attendance, Hussein
said: ``So what?''
   In his speech, Mulroney made only a brief reference to ``attacks
on Kuwait by a neighboring country'' and focused on the
international flavor of the meeting.
   ``The hopeful symbols of our new age are compelling,'' he said.
``The Iron Curtain is in tatters. Germany is uniting. The two
Koreas are talking. The United Nations is working.
   ``And right here in Ottawa, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and
Poland - in another symbol of this new age - are adhering to the
constitution of Interpol.''
   Despite all this, crime still posed problems.
   ``Crime is going global,'' Mulroney said. ``If Interpol did not
exist, it would have to be invented.
   ``Interpol extends `the long arm of the law' around the globe.''

<HEAD>Three Arrested For Conspiring To Bribe Maritime Administration

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian businessman and his U.S.
representative were arrested Thursday on a charge of conspiring to
bribe a Maritime Administration official $201,000 for preferential
treatment in buying a ship.
   O.M. Prakash Agarwal, 56, the managing director of a Bombay
company that scraps oceangoing ships, was arrested along with his
U.S. representative, Rashmi R. Kant, 37, prosecutors said in a
statement.
   Laxmi Chand, the 49-year-old president of a local travel agency,
was also arrested, said the statement by Henry Hudson, the U.S.
attorney in Alexandria, Va.
   More than $3.2 million in cash and checks that authorities
charge was used to pay the bribe and for the attempt to purchase
the ship was seized during the arrest, prosecutors said.
   The official of the Maritime Administration, which finances the
construction of ocean-going ships and sells vessels when loans are
defaulted, cooperated with the investigation, said Transportation
Department spokesman Bob Marks.
   The investigation by the FBI and the Transportation Department's
inspector general began in June, prosecutors said. The official
allegedly offered the bribe was not identified.
   Kant, who lives in the Washington suburb of Fairfax, Va., is
vice president of Trident Trading Corp. of Arlington, Va.
   Agarwal is managing director of Hariyana Ship-Breakers PUT. LTD.
of Bombay. Chand is president of Worldwide Travel Inc. of
Washington and lives in suburban Great Falls, Va.
   The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of five years
imprisonment plus a $250,000 fine.

   A task force investigating a string of slayings
is focusing on six former or current police officers in the death
and disappearance of two prostitutes, two newspapers said.
   Meanwhile, authorities continued their search Thursday for
another killer believed to have fatally stabbed five women since
January.
   The San Diego Union and the Los Angeles Times reported the
Metropolitan Homicide Task Force is investigating six current or
former officers wh  reportedly knew slain prostitute Donna Gentile
or her friend Cynthia Lynn Maine, who is missing.
   Both women were prostitutes, had served as police informants and
were romantically involved with at least one officer, the
newspapers said.
   Gentile, who was found dead in 1985, is believed to be the first
victim in a string of 43 slayings in San Diego County. The victims,
all women, were dumped in remote areas of the county. Most were
prostitutes with histories of drug abuse and most were strangled.
   Gentile died soon after testifying before a city Civil Service
Commission investigating police misconduct. Rocks had been packed
in her mouth, suggesting to detectives that she was killed because
of her testimony.
   Maine, the daughter of a former San Diego police officer,
disappeared in 1986, three months after being released from jt to travel
as much
or they might not stay at a full service hotel such as Marriott,''
said Marriott spokesman Terry Souers.
   As a partial result, last week Marriott announced a 12 to 18
month stall of construction starts. The company sold approximately
$900 million in assets so far this year with an additional $700
million scheduled for the auction block in the next few months.
   Discounting the unforseen food service expenses and the revenue
from the sale of the London Marriott last year, earnings increased
9 percent in the third quarter, Souers said.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Bill to Compensate Miners and Nuclear Test
Neighbors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress approved a bill Thursday offering
money and an apology to the so-called ``victims of the Cold War''
in some western states who may have developed cancer from nuclear
bomb testing or uranium mining.
   The bill, approved on voice vote by the House and sent to the
president, is an admission that the government was wrong to test
nuclear weapons above ground in Nevada while people were living in
fallout areas downwind, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who led
debate for the measure.
   It also recognizes the government's liability in allowing people
to mine uranium for nuclear weapons without protective gear, he
said.
   ``American citizens going about their business were exposed to
radiation in degrees we would not allow now,'' said Frank. ``Miners
sent into the mines without even the slightest protection against
the material they were being asked to mine.''
   The bill authorizes $10 million for a Radiation Exposure Trust
Fund. Money for the fund would have to be appropriated in a
separate bill.
   The bill provides compensation for people who got cancer in
certain time periods and:
   -Spent two years - one year for some cancers - in downwind areas
of Nevada, Arizona or Utah from nuclear tests between 1951 and
1958, or between June and July, 1962.
   -Or mined uranium in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming or
Utah from 1947 to 1971.
   The Justice Department would process claims and determine the
amount due.
   A driving force behind the legislation was Stewart Udall, former
member of Congress and interior secretary, whose brother Rep.
Morris Udall, D-Ariz., is chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   Stewart Udall represented the uranium miners in a lawsuit
against the federal government. The courts ruled the government was
immune from prosecution because national security dictated a need
for the uranium, but judges involved in the case urged the miners
to seek redress from Congress.
   Calling it ``a good day for the people,'' Stewart Udall said,
``I'm hearing all kinds of voices that the president will sign it,
and I hope he will.''
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who once was a lawyer for the
downwinders, sponsored the legislation.
   ``It seems so appropriate as we have watched in wonder at the
demise of the Cold War that we come and compensate the victims of
the Cold War that were downwind of the testing and the miners who
mined the uranium,'' said Owens.
   Owens said he was a high school student in Utah during the
testing.
   The government knew the potential dangers of nuclear fallout and
no tests were conducted when the wind was blowing towards densley
populated areas of California and Nevada, he said.
   ``In very real fact the federal government made the decision to
bomb these people to whom this bill makes an apology and a
compensatory payment of a small amount,'' he said.
   Above-ground nuclear tests throw radioactive debris into the
atmosphere that can settle far away from the explosion site. A
major source of radioactivity in such cases was an isotope of
strontium which was eaten by cows in their pastures, passed on in
their milk and taken up in human bones like calcium.
   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to stop testing
above ground in 1963.
   The radioactive decay of uranium releases radon, a radioactive
gas that can build up in mines. It was the increase of lung cancer
among miners that alerted public health authorities to the dangers
of radon buildup in homes, usually to much lower concentrations
than in mines.

<HEAD>Macao Governor, Linked to Corruption Probe, Offers to Resign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor of Macao, linked to a
corruption probe in the Far East colony, offered to resign
Thursday.
   Carlos Melancia contends there were irregularities in the
seven-month investigation into alleged attempts to sell privileges
t  a West German company seeking work on a planned international
airport at the colony on the Chinese coast near Hong Kong.
   At a Lisbon news conference, Malancia said he was ``indignant
and surprised'' by the findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office,
and claimed the investigation was politically motivated.
   Malancia's assistant, Francisco Murteira Nabo, would take over
as acting governor of the enclave of about 290,000 people if the
resignation is accepted, Macao government officials said.
   The prosecutor's report will be passed to a judge, who has eight
days to decide whether to charge Melancia.
   ``I'm certain the courts will recognize my innocence,'' said
Malancia.
   The investigation began following a series of Portuguese
newspaper reports.
   In February, the conservative Lisbon weekly O Independente
published a copy of a fax, allegedly sent to Melancia from
Weidleplan Consulting demanding the return of $368,000 after the
company failed to win a contract for work on the airport.
   Melancia's supporters denounced the fax as a fake. Some have
suggested the governor is victim of a plot to discredit President
Mario Soares, who appointed Melancia to the governorship in 1987.
   ``The false accusations of which I have been the target were in
the framework of a public poison campaign orchestrated with
political intentions,'' Melancia said.
   He has threatened to press charges against O Independente.
   An official at Stuttgart, West Germany-based Weidleplan
contacted Thursday said the company would not comment on the case.
   Soares has called presidential elections in Portugal for
January. The former Socialist Party leader is widely expected to
run for a second term. Opinion polls show he has support of more
than 60 percent of voters.
   Political analysts suggest a scandal in Macao could hurt Soares'
re-election bid.
   Other figures named in connection with what has become known as
``fatal fax case'' include Socialist supporters closely linked to
Soares.
   A statement from the Public Prosecutor's Office said evidence
had been found against others, but they were not named.
   Europe's oldest colonial outpost in the Far East, Macao was
ceded to Portugal in 1557. The 6.4-square-mile territory has grown
rich as a gambling and tourism center.

   Two quakes measuring 4.3 and
4.7 on the Richter scale shook central South Africa early Thursday,
killing two miners working more than a mile underground.
   Five other miners at the President Brand gold mine southwest of
Johannesburg suffered minor injuries, officials said.
   The tremors hit seconds apart before dawn in the Orange Free
State and Western Transvaal areas, according to news reports.
Cracks in buildings and other minor damage were reported in Welkom,
about 125 miles southwest of Johannesburg.
   Mine officials said they would investigate the deaths and
injuries in a shaft 1.3 miles beneath the surface.
   South Africa's gold mines are the deepest in the world.
Accidents claim dozens of lifes in the mines each year.
   A quake of magnitude 4 is capable of causing moderate damage,
while one of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the
nomination of New Hampshire jurist David H. Souter to the Supreme
Court on Thursday with but one dissenting vote.
   The full Senate is expected to confirm him easily when it votes
next Tuesday, the day after the court begins its session.
   Democrats as well as Republicans on the committee said they saw
in President Bush's nominee a brilliant legal scholar and a man of
good temperament and integrity. In the 13-1 vote, only Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., opposed him, saying he feared Souter would
``solidify a 5-4 anti-civil-rights, anti-privacy majority.''
   Howell Heflin, a conservative Alabama Democrat whose opposition
helped kill the 1987 Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, said
he liked Souter's ``clearheaded approach'' and lack of an
ideological agenda.
   Added Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio: ``My sense is that David Souter
is a fair and open-minded jurist who knows well the weight of the
responsibilities which will be placed upon him,''
   Bush hailed the committee action and repeated his request that
the Senate ``act as quickly as possible to confirm this man'' so he
could be seated when the court begins its new session.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell announced Thursday
night that he and Republican leaders agreed to hold the
confirmation vote on Souter on Tuesday.
   The Jewish holiday Yom Kippur which was interrupting Congress'
schedule Friday. And Biden and other Democrats were loathe to waive
rules that give senators time before voting to review a committee's
findings.
   Souter, 51, in a statement released in New Hampshire, thanked
committee leaders and members ``for their courtesy and
consideration. I am gratified by their action. I await the decision
of the full Senate.''
   Earlier, Tom Rath, like Souter a former New Hampshire attorney
general, said Souter heard of the panel's action on a radio in
Rath's law office.
   ``To get this kind of overwhelming support makes us feel very
good,'' Rath said, adding that Souter would issue his separate
statement as soon as the White House approved it.
   The lopsided vote did not show the widespread unease on the
committee caused by Souter's refusal to state his positions on
abortion and other critical issues before the court.
   ``Judge Souter is not the sort of judge I would nominate if I
were president,'' said committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., a
supporter of abortion rights.
   Souter ``just barely'' met his criteria, Biden said. ``But I
think that he is about the best we can expect'' from Bush, who
opposes abortion rights, he said.
   ``Aspects of Judge Souter's testimony were of little comfort to
legal conservatives including this senator,'' said Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., in a statement released at the committee session. ``But we
recognize that the president is entitled to considerable deference
in his choice for the Supreme Court.''
   Humphrey's New Hampshire colleague, Warren Rudman, a Republican
not on the Budget Committee who has been Souter's mentor and Senate
champion, said he was pleased with the vote and not disturbed by
the reservations expressed by some members.
   ``That's normal,'' Rudman said. ``Those are people whoare
obviously concerned about staking out political grounds for the
future and I can understand that.''
   Democrats who supported Souter expressed faith that he was as
open-minded on women's rights and other issues as he professed to
be. But Kennedy refused to go along.
   ``I am troubled that... he will solidify a 5-4
anti-civil-rights, anti-privacy majority inclined to turn back the
clock on the historic progress of recent decades,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I hope I am wrong. But I fear I am right,'' Kennedy said.
``The lesson of the past decade ... is that we must vote our fears,
not our hopes.''
   ``I hope I'm not wrong,'' said Metzenbaum, usually a Kennedy
ally, in revealing his affirmative vote.
   Kennedy won't be quite so alone when the nomination comes before
the full Senate. Five other Democrats had announced their
opposition to the nomination by Thursday, mostly based on the
abortion issue.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
attended Thursday's committee meeting and said afterward: ``I
tremble for the women of the United States.''
   Senate Republicans urged the majority Democrats to schedule a
full Senate vote before Monday.
   ``If we delay for only three days there will be a dozen cases in
which he cannot participate,'' said Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.,
the deputy GOP leader. The court planned to hear arguments on four
cases on each of the first three days next week.

<TEXT>
   The lower house of Parliament on Thursday
overwhelmingly approved constitutional changes and a law that could
result in a presidential election as early as Nov. 25.
   The election law, passed 268-12, authorizes the speaker of
Parliament to set a date for elections as quickly as 60 days. A
second round of elections is possible if no candidate gets 50
percent of the ballots in the first round.
   Under the constitutional amendment, approved 325-4, the
president is elected in a general ballot and may serve up to two
five-year terms.
   The Parliament banned campaign financing from foreign sources
and campaigning 36 hours before the election. Deputies refused a
proposal to bar campaigning at churches and other religious sites,
a common activity in Poland.
   The changes require approval by the upper chamber - Senate - and
the president, but that is considered likely. The Senate is in
session Friday.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has already declared his candidacy
in the first popular presidential ballot since before World War II.
He seeks to succeed Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is stepping down
early as head of state.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former adviser and ally of
Walesa, also is considering running and is expected to announce his
decision next week. Several other candidates are likely. A
candidate must be nominated by a party or else collect 100,000
signatures to get on the ballot.
   A caucus representing former Communists tried unsuccessfully to
lower the number of signatures required to 50,000.
   Jaruzelski asked Parliament on Sept. 19 to shorten his term of
office in order to permit an election. In recent months, there were
increasing calls for the former Communist Party leader to step down
as an unwanted symbol of the country's old hard-line order.
   Jaruzelski, who ordered martial law in 1981 following
Solidarity-led unrest, was elected to a six-year term as president
in July 1989 by a joint session of the Sejm, or lower house, and
the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Religious leaders Thursday condemned a new movie
rating system as pandering to ``sexually exploitative material.''
   The church officials urged the Motion Picture Association of
America to reconsider its action replacing the ``X'' rating with
the new ``No Children'' or ``NC-17'' rating.
   ``It is an arrogant and ill advised decision which deeply
affects the public good. It was made in isolation, without public
consultation. The change is neither in the public interest nor in
the best interest of the community,'' the church leaders said in a
joint statment.
   The statement was issued by communication leaders of the U.S.
Catholic Conference and the National Council of Churches, which
includes most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations.
   They spoke out after the motion picture association Wednesday
said it has decided to substitute the new ``NC-17'' category for
the ``X'' rating used on adult films since 1968.
   The church officials charged that the association ``has caved in
to the commercial interests of those who are attempting to get
sexually exploitative material into general theatrical release.''
   They urged members of the National Association of Theater Owners
to refuse to book NC-17 movies, and newspapers and others to refuse
to accept advertising for them.
   ``Changing the name of the `X' category does not change the
nature of the material,'' the statement said.
   Local congregations were also urged to monitor enforcement of
age restrictions under the NC-17 category and other categories.
   The statement was issued by Bishop Edward J. O'Donnell, chairman
of the communication committee of the U.S. Catholic Conference, and
by Beverly Chain, who heads the National Council's communications
unit.
   They said the motion picture association's action ``will be used
by those who already are calling for government regulation of the
media.
   ``That is unfortunate, because a voluntary system of
self-regulation that skirts Constitutional concerns, yet affords at
least a minimum of protection to the public, is workable.''
   The motion picture association said that under its changed
rating system the existing ``R'' or restricted rating would be
clarified to include an explanation of why a film was placed in
that category.
   Such explanations could be an emphasis on such themes as sex,
violence, profanity, drug use or sucicide, and would be made
available to parents and other moviegoers.
   As for the new ``NC-17'' films, the association said they would
``continue to be evaluated as X-rated films have been in the past,
that is, on the basis that most parents would agree'' such films
should not be viewed by youngsters.

   Members of the Sematech semiconductor research
consortium have troubled relations with companies supplying
materials and manufacturing equipment, the General Accounting
Office said Thursday.
   These weak relations, coupled with the high cost of capital,
hinder efforts to strengthen the U.S. materials and equipment
industry, supplier executives believe.
   Mark Nelson, Sematech's director of government relations, said
the consortium has taken steps to better those relations.
   ``The GAO recognized a problem which we were already aware of
and in the process of addressing,'' Nelson said. ``We've already
made significant progress since that survey'' with a new program of
links with supplier companies.
   Fourteen computer companies belong to the Sematech consortium,
backing it with $100 million that has been matched by Congress each
of the last three years.
   The consortium undertakes research in the computer chips that
form the foundation of a half-trillion dollar worldwide electronics
industry.
   In manufacturing equipment, the Japanese market share rose from
25 percent in 1983 to 40 percent in 1988 while the U.S. share
dropped from 69 percent to 51 percent in the same period, GAO said.
   GAO, the investigating arm of Congress, interviewed 31 supplier
industry executives last spring.
   It was supplier relations of consoritum members, not the Austin,
Texas-based consortium itself, that drew criticism.
   The GAO report said the suppliers want the consortium members to
``emulate Sematech's example'' in working more closely with them.
   The GAO interviewers found that half their subjects said
Sematech's member companies need to establish better relationships
with them.
   The suppliers particularly wanted long-term relationships
permitting them to participate in their customers' planning, to
share technical performance data and to get their customers to
assume some of the costs and risks associated with developing the
next generation of equipment.
   Three suppliers noted ``Japanese companies provide better
feedback than their U.S. counterparts on how their equipment is
performing.''
   Sematech implemented a program last month called Partnering for
Total Quality to improve those relationships, Nelson said. The plan
calls for sharing of strategic goals and plans, performance
information and some cost information, he said.
   ``This initiative, which is directed at one of the central
issues that suppliers' executives highlighted for reasserting U.S.
technological leadership, requires that Sematech's members change
the way they have traditionally conducted business with their
suppliers,'' the GAO report said.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Congressman Kidnapping; Peruvian Mine Accord Reached</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-Cuban guerrillas claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping of a congressman, the highest-level political
official seized by rebels in 10 years of guerrilla insuurgency, a
Lima newspaper said Thursday.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement sent photos to the daily
Pagina Libre showing Gerardo Lopez sitting beneath a rebel flag.
   Lopez, 34, who heads the governing Cambio 90 Movement
congressional delegation, was dragged from his home Sunday by three
rebels with machine guns.
   The Tupac Amaru used similar methods in the Sept. 11 kidnapping
of a cement company executive, who is still missing, police said.
   In a phone call to the newspaper, a guerrilla spokesman said
Lopez was in Lima and was unharmed. The spokesman said they had
``invited him to talk'' and would be released later. The movement
has not demanded a ransom.
   Two congressmen were killed by guerrillas in April 1989, but
police ruled out the Tupac Amaru in both cases. The head of the
Tupac Amaru and 47 other members staged a spectacular jailbreak in
July and have not been recaptured.
   The movement, much smaller and less violent than the Maoist
Shining Path, took up arms in 1984. Shining Path began its bloody
insurgency in the Andes in 1980.
   Elsewhere in Peru, workers at the state mining company
Mineroperu on Thursday agreed to end their 41-day strike, a mining
federation spokesman said.
   More than 80 percent of Mineroperu's 12,500 miners agreed to an
accord guaranteeing an unspecified pay rise, said Simon Diaz
Huamani, spokesman for the National Miners Federation.
   The federation said the strike produced losses of $1 million a
day, but the company refuses to give a figure.
   The strike was centered in the Mineroperu facilities in Cerro
Verde, Cajamarquilla and Ilo.
   Ricardo Salzedo, spokesman for Mineroperu, said the company
would renew copper, gold and zinc shipments ``as soon as
possible,'' but would not specify a date.

a career CIA officer, as deputy director for operations.
   The CIA said in a statement that Twetten, 55, on Jan. 1 will
succeed Richard F. Stolz, 64, as chief of operations, the division
that oversees espionage and covert activities.
   Stolz, who served in the agency from 1950 to 1981 and then
returned to CIA duty in 1988, is retiring.
   Webster, in a statement, said Stolz ``has made an enormous
contribution in charting the role of human intelligence in a

challenging issues, serving the agency and the country with great
distinction.''
   Twetten has served as Stolz's deputy since June 1988.

<TEXT>
   Using an obscure constitutional provision, Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney received permission Thursday from Queen
Elizabeth II to appoint eight partisan senators to help push
through a controversial tax.
   The new lawmakers, who serve until age 75, bring the Senate to
112 seats and give Mulroney's Conservative Party a majority in both
the Senate and House of Commons.
   The new members were sworn into office by the Senate clerk late
Thursday, but will not take their seats until the chamber resumes
work next week.
   An opposition leader called Mulroney's move ``an abuse of
power'' and legal challenges loom. The only other similar request
was in 1873, but the appeal was not granted.
   The nation's 1867 Constitution allows the British monarch to add
four or eight members to the Senate on a request by the
governor-general, the Canadian representative to the Commonwealth.
   Mulroney used the measure as a last resort to save the 7 percent
goods and services tax, stalled in the Liberal-dominated Senate.
The Commons, dominated by Conservatives, supported the tax.
   The proposed consumption tax would replace a 13 percent tax paid
by manufacturers. Some basics, such as groceries, would be exempt
from the tax, but it would affect even such services as a haircut.
   Mulroney said the debate goes beyond the tax proposal to the
principle of whether the elected Commons should prevail over the
appointed Senate.
   ``The consequences for our parliamentary system are enormous,''
he said. ``What is at stake is one of the principles of our
freedom. ''
   John Haslam, a spokesman for the queen, said Elizabeth, as the
constitutional monarch of the former British colony, followed the
provisions of the Canadian Constitution in making the decision.
   But even with the additional seats, the fate of the tax could
rest on the votes of a handful of Independents.
   Before Mulroney's move, the Liberals held 52 seats and the
Conservatives 46, with one Reform Party representative, four
Independents and one Independent Liberal.
   Over the last two months, Mulroney has filled 15 Senate
vacancies with Conservative loyalists to narrow the gap.
   Liberal leader Jean Chretien warned the public will not back
Mulroney, whose popularity has dipped sharply in polls.
   ``When you are 15 percent in the polls and taking an abuse of
power and stacking the Senate, he might find that he will not go
very far politically with that,'' he said.
   And Liberal Senate leader Allan MacEachen promised that the
fight against the tax will intensify.
   ``It leaves me in an even more agressive mood,'' MacEachen said.
``We'll continue the battle ... (But) unless all the Independents
vote with us, we can't defeat it.''
   Also, legal challenges are threatened.
   British Columbia has said it will contest Ottawa's ability to
create the extra Senate seats, Ontario has said it may join that
campaign. Alberta has promised a separate challenge on some aspects
of the tax.

<HEAD>Dictator's Son Ordered Released on Grounds of Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military court on Thursday released
Nicu Ceausescu, the youngest son of the former dictator, from jail
for three months because of failing health, the official Rompress
news agency said.
   The same court on Friday convicted Ceausescu, who is suffering
from an advanced case of cirrhosis of the liver, of complicity in
murder and sentenced him to 20 years in prison.
   But it also agreed to Defense Attorny Paula Iacob's request for
a third medical examination after two earlier ones reached
contradictory conclusions about the 39-year-old Ceausescu's ability
to withstand an extended stay in jail.
   Thursday's decision apparently was a result of the latest
medical examination. Ceausescu also is appealing the conviction.
   He initially was charged in connection with 89 deaths that took
place during December's revolution in the Transylvanian city of
Sibiu, where he had been Communist Party chief since 1987.
   His father, Nicolae Ceausescu, and mother, Elena, was executed
in the revolution, which ended more than four decades of communism
in Romania.
   Nicu, who had earned a reputation as a hard-living playboy with
political ambitions, also is recovering from a stab wound suffered
when he was arrested Dec. 22.
   He was held in prison hospitals during most of his five-month
trial. According to Romanian law, Ceausescu is eligible for
successive releases on health grounds until he either recovers or
the sentence expires.
   Prosecutors were given three days to appeal the decision to
release him.

<HEAD>Religious Leaders Praise New Law, But Call It Stopgap</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with Vatican, Ukrainian
statements. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `Russian Orthodox...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet religious leaders said Thursday they are
satisfied with the country's new law on freedom of conscience, but
consider it a stopgap measure.
   The law, which the national legislature approved in principle on
Wednesday, calls a halt to decades of repression by forbidding the
government from interfering in the practice of religion.
   It also improves the legal status of religious organizations,
guarantees the right to study religious doctrine and calls for a
religious council to advise the government on human rights.
   Vatican chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the new law
``renders justice to millions of believers.''
   ``The Ukrainian Catholic Church welcomes this first step toward
true religious freedom,'' added church head Cardinal Myroslav Ivan
Lubachivsky.
   Russian Orthodox, Baptist and Jewish leaders told reporters at a
press conference organized by the Foreign Ministry that the law is
a major step forward. But they said it is complex and unclear on
some points.
   ``I think this law will be of a transitional nature,'' said
Georgi Komendant, president of the Soviet Baptist Society. ``In due
time, if eveything is OK, it should be more brief, less
complicated.''
   Komendant also said the spirit of the law - official tolerance
for religion - is more important than the wording.
   ``This is a good law ... and as Baptists, we are satisfied with
it,'' he said.
   Metropolitan Pitirim, a leader of the dominant Russian Orthodox
Church, called the law ``unprecedented'' and said ``it can be
considered successful as a first offspring'' of democratic reforms.
But, he added, ``A lot of provisions need clarifying.''
   Among the ambiguities are whether public schools can teach about
various religions, whether the military should hold services for
religious soldiers and whether conscientious objectors will be
allowed an alternative to military duty.
   The chief rabbi of Moscow, Adolph Shayevich, said he helped
draft the law and is generally happy with it. But he expressed
concern that it may not be respected.
   ``Our Supreme Soviet has adopted a lot of laws, but
unfortunately, not all of them are fully effective,'' he said. ``It
would be very regrettable if after adoption, it takes a long time
to implement this law.''
   Shayevich also said he does not believe the law will reduce the
flow of Soviet Jews to Israel. The main reasons for Jewish
emigration, he said, are anti-Semitism - which ``has become more
open and organized'' in recent years - and the Soviet economy,
which is beset by shortages, inflation and inefficiency.
   A member of the Supreme Soviet committee that drafted the law,
Andrei Sebentsov, said the legislature is expected to give it final
approval Monday. It was adopted in principle early Wednesday by a
vote of 341-1 with one abstention.
   ``We want to put an end to harassment of religious people and
give them equal rights, as they have in most countries,'' Sebentsov
said.
   ``Of course, we can't say that (the law) is ideal for the
future, but for the decade, it is what our society needs,'' he
added.
   Western scholars estimate one-quarter of the 285 million Soviet
people practice some faith, and the number appears to be rising
fast as official tolerance replaces hard-line communist opposition
to religion.
   In recent years, churches confiscated by the government have
been reopened, Jews have been allowed to hold Hebrew classes,
state-run television has broadcast holiday church services and
government propaganda against religion has subsided.

<TEXT>
   A judge Thursday ordered ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto to stand trial on two more corruption
charges in a mounting legal onslaught that could disqualify her
from next month's election.
   Judge Wajihuddin Ahmed issued the notice for Ms. Bhutto to
appear before the tribunal on Sunday to answer charges of
misconduct and abuse of power during her 20-month administration.
   Ms. Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is also ordered to
appear in court on Sunday charged with failing to cooperate in a
police investigation, said the state news agency.
   Associated Press of Pakistan claimed the 38-year-old Zardari
ignored several official requests to appear before the Federal
Investigation Agency.
   Ms. Bhutto, already facing trial on two corruption charges in
the eastern city of Lahore, was campaigning in the Sindh Province
countryside and unavailable for comment.
   Her lawyers have not said whether she will appear before the
special courts, which could disqualify her from the Oct. 24
election and bar her from politics for seven years if she is
convicted. She can be tried in absentia.
   Ms. Bhutto, who won election in November 1988 and became the
first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation, is a candidate for five
seats in the 217-member National Assembly, the policy-making lower
house of Parliament.
   Her aides say Ms. Bhutto ran for five seats in case she was
disqualified from some of the races.
   The army-backed caretaker government has accused Ms. Bhutto of
illegally using an Asia Development Bank loan to hire a foreign
consulting firm to oversee a Karachi power project.
   She also have been accused of allowing a British-based firm to
export cotton at rates far below the international market rate,
costing the government an estimated $100 million.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan invoked his constitutional powers
and dismissed Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6. He alleged that, among other
things, her government used tens of millions of dollars in special
funds to buy votes and political favors, awarded lucrative buisness
deals to friends and relatives and demanded commissions on
government contracts.
   Earlier this week, a tribunal in Lahore ordered the 37-year-old
former prime minister to stand trial Oct. 2 for allegedly approving
the illegal sale of 287 acres of federal land to a London-based
company operated by a cousin.
   She is to be tried Oct. 9 for allegedly canceling contracts for
distribution of liquified gas and awarding them to friends and
relatives that she claimed had suffered during a decade of martial
law.
   Ms. Bhutto has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly
accused the president of corruption and nepotism.
   The caretaker government, comprised largely of Ms. Bhutto's
opponents and former allies, has spent much of the past month
trying to portray Ms. Bhutto's administration as the most corrupt
in Pakistan's 43-year history.
   Most analysts say Ms. Bhutto and the People's Party appear to be
gaining strength and could emerge from next month's election as the
single largest bloc.

<HEAD>Hightower: FBI Inquiry Is Political</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is inquiring into the campaign
finances of two Texas Democrats, one of them running against the
son of U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and the other
against a candidate backed by President Bush's eldest son.
   The inquiries are politically motivated, says one of the
Democrats, Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower.
   On Monday, FBI agent Greg Rampton obtained from the secretary of
state copies of 1988-90 campaign finance reports filed by Hightower
and lieutenant governor hopeful Bob Bullock.
   ``I resent the FBI getting into my political campaign with these
kinds of overt acts of political activity,'' Hightower said
Thursday. ``It amounts to Nixonian dirty tricks here.''
   Bullock's Republican opponent is Rob Mosbacher Jr., son of U.S.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. Hightower faces state Rep.
Rick Perry, a Republican who has received backing from the
president's eldest son, George W. Bush.
   ``Two Democrats who the administration seems most interested in
getting: Mr. Bullock because he's had the gall to run against Mr.
Mosbacher's boy ... Myself because I've been something of a burr
under the saddle of the Bush administration on their price-busting,
farm-bankrupting agriculture policies,'' Hightower said.
   Perry and Mosbacher said they had nothing to do with the FBI
inquiry.
   ``I don't know anything more about it than I've read in the
papers,'' Mosbacher said.
   ``I don't know anybody in the FBI, and I can assure you that
none of them have talked to me,'' Perry said. But he said the
inquiry shows that ``irregularities in (Hightower's) agency have
caught the attention of federal authorities.''
   At a news conference, Hightower said Rampton had questioned many
of his agency's employees and tried to get one to wear a hidden
microphone.
   ``They tried to put a wire on one of my employees and send him
in to talk to me. They have harassed our office staff,'' he
charged.
   Neither Byron Sage, agent-in-charge of the Austin FBI office,
nor Rampton returned telephone calls from The Associated Press.
Their office referred inquiries to FBI spokesman Claude Martin in
San Antonio, who didn't immediately return a call.
   Bullock, the five-term state comptroller, said the FBI inquiry
may have stemmed from complaints by a disgruntled former employee.
Bullock and Hightower, who is seeking re-election, said they had
done nothing wrong and had nothing to hide.

   A man who took part in a search for a
missing 13-year-old neighbor girl has been charged with murdering
the girl and burying her body in his basement.
   Henry L. Meinholz, 52, pleaded innocent to murder Thursday in
the death of Melissa Benoit, who disappeared Sept. 15. He was
ordered held without bail and sent to a state psychiatric hospital
for evaluation.
   Meinholz's lawyer, Jack Atwood, said: ``At this point, he denies

   Police Chief Alan Ballinger later said police believe another
body may be buried on Meinholz's property. ``We are looking for a

   Meinholz was arrested Wednesday after Melissa's artially clad
body was found buried in his basement. An autopsy was being
conducted to determine the cause of death. Officials would not say
what led them to Meinholz, who is an accountant at a lumber store.
   About 150 people booed and shouted ``Guilty'' and ``Hang him''
as Meinholz, entered the courthouse in this town 35 miles south of
Boston.
   Meinholz's lawyer said the court's psychiatric consultant
testified at a closed hearing after the arraignment that Meinholz
had some mental problems, including sleeping and eating disorders.
   Meinholz's wife, Jane, a nurse at a psychiatric hospital, said
her husband ``has been a very gentle husband for 27 years. He's a
wonderful, warm, compassionate man.'' And then she added: ``My
heart is aching for the Benoits.''

<HEAD>Seven Held in Beheading of American Innkeeper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four soldiers and three civilian military
aides are being held in connection with the beheading of an
American innkeeper, a federal human rights official said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, a rights group claimed an army colonel and another
officer are also involved in the June murder of Michael Devine, 49,
who ran a small inn near the Mayan ruins of Tikal in northern
Guatemala.
   The United States has threatened to cut off military aid to
Guatemala if the murder of Devine, a 19-year resident of Guatemala,
is not fully investigated.
   Guatemala's rights ombudsman, Fernando Hurtado Prem, said his
office had been conducting an independent investigation since June
12, three days after Devine's body was found by a roadside.
   Hurtado Prem cannot prosecute, but can investigate and make
recommendations.
   He said the inquiry found several witnesses who linked the
vehicle used by the killers to the military base at Santa Elena,
near the provincial capital of Flores in northern Guatemala.
   He identified the soldiers suspected in the killings as Rafael
Tiul Cucul, Pablo Lajuj Ixmalej, Carlos Zelada Marroquin and
Augustin Esquivel Hernandez. No ranks were given.
   Also held were Ricardo Guzman, Andres Morente Tipol and Benjamin
Punji Perush, all civilians who work for the military as local
``commissioners,'' Hurtado Prem said.
   The Guatemalan military maintains an extensive system of
civilian collaborators, such as commissioners and civil defense
patrols, to enforce its authority in the countryside and help
battle the small force of leftists guerrillas who have been
fighting the past 30 years.
   The Mutual Support Group said the ex-commander of the base, Col.
Mario Garcia Catalan, was also involved in the murder. The colonel
was relieved of his command earlier this month. The rights advocacy
group also accused another officer at the base.
   The group's president, Nineth Montenegro de Garcia, said she had
discussed the case with a United Nations rights observer, Christian
Tomuschat.
   Guatemala's bleak rights record prompted a total suspension of
U.S. aid between 1977 and 198, when a civilian government took
office.
   In the last year, however, the number of murders, kidnappings
and disappearances linked to the right wing and the military began
rising sharply.
   President Vinicio Cerezo promised a full investigation into
Devine's murder in a recent letter to U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Stroock. Devine, a former Peace Corps volunteer, was from
Belleville, Ill.
   According to some reports, U.S. officials suspect he may have
stumbled on evidence of military involvement in the drug trade.

   Ticket agents took advantage of a computer
glitch that allowed them to buy winning lottery tickets worth a $1
million after the numbers were drawn, lottery officials said
Thursday.
   James Wimsatt, New Hampshire Sweepstakes director, said six
people illegally played the winning numbers in the Tri-State
Megabucks game for Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
   The Wednesday night drawing had a $1.1 million jackpot for which
one legitimate winning ticket was sold.
   No payments were made for the invalid Megabucks' tickets,
Wimsatt said.
   However, he said at least 10 vendors issued about 50 winning
tickets, worth a total of about $156,000, for the daily lottery
drawn the same night.
   Some of those winning tickets - worth as much as $5,000 each -
were cashed in, but the state won't lose any money because it is
insured against such a problem, he said.
   The state is investigating the scam and if any of the ticket
buyers are caught they will be required to return the ill-gotten
winnings, Wimsatt said.
   ``It's like if you walk into a bank and the vault's open and no
one's watching you,'' he said. ``You don't just walk in and help
yourself.''
   The daily numbers tickets cost 50 cents and $1; Megabucks
tickets are $1. Officials said the computer program that is
supposed to halt ticket sales 10 minutes before the drawings
malfunctioned.
   Dave Long, a spokesman for the Megabucks game, said three people
in Maine, two in New Hampshire and one in Vermont played the
winning numbers right after the drawing.
   The legitimate winning ticket was sold in Maine.

   The six-week-old U.N. economic embargo
has not kept Iraq from receiving food and supplies by truck from
Jordan, jetliner from South America, via smugglers from Syria and
Iran, and even by mule from Turkey.
   The embargo has halted virtually all of Iraq's oil exports and
drastically reduced cargo shipments to the country, but supplies
are slipping in thanks to sympathetic governments, pro-Iraqi groups
and opportunistic smugglers.
   ``There are a lot of ways for an innovative shipper to avoid a
blockade, and as the price goes up, they become more innovative,''
said Capt. Paul Prokop, commander of U.S. Coast Guard teams
enforcing the embargo in the Persian Gulf.
   The amount of slippage is difficult to determine. Before Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting the international community to
impose the sanctions, it imported about three-quarters of its food
supplies.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - President Bush is warning U.S. and world oil
markets that if ``intensive and unwarranted speculation'' does not
end, he may expand the first-time use of the national petroleum
stockpile to control escalating prices.
   The president announced Wednesday he will sell 5 million barrels
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   ``I'm prepared to take additional steps, if necessary, to ensure
that America stays strong right here at home,'' Bush told a
political fund-raising audience in Rosemont, Ill., on Wednesday
night.
   He announced his decision during a two-day trip to help
Republican gubernatorial and Senate candidates.
   ---&equals;
   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - The Persian Gulf crisis is forcing
Saudi Arabia, which traditionally has relied on quiet diplomacy, to
take aggressive steps - even against Arab states once considered
allies.
   Jordan and Yemen have already experienced the newfound Saudi
punitive power. Indications are that the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or at least its leader Yasser Arafat, will be next.
   Sudan, another recipient of Saudi financial aid that has not
broken with Iraq over its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, could soon see
its relations with Riyadh sour.
   ``There will be a settlement of accounts when this is over,'' a
Saudi diplomatic official said Wednesday. ``We have to stand up for
principle. It is no more Mr. Nice Guy. . . . There is no longer the
fear of offending Arabs.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - There will be fewer maps for troops in the
Middle East. A million children won't be vaccinated against polio,
measles and diphtheria. There may not be enough government lawyers
to argue before the Supreme Court. Airline flights will be reduced
and most space shuttles won't fly at all.
   All this, and more, is predicted if there is no budget agreement
and the president orders automatic spending cuts Monday, the first
day of the government's 1991 fiscal year.
   For 2.4 million federal employees with mortgage payments and
mouths to feed, the impact could range from a few days off without
pay to the devastation that faces Jeannette Gordon. She could be
laid off 255 days out of a work year of 260.
   Most agencies of the government expect to be forced to trim
expenses by 32.4 percent. They'll do it by cutting services to the
taxpayer, suspending programs, furloughing employees, putting off
that needed paint job or turning out the lights at night.
   ---&equals;
   ASHINGTON (AP) - The Sudan has asked the United States for $150
million in food aid at a time when the Sudanese Air Force has been
attempting to bomb existing food shipments earmarked for rebel
areas, U.S. officials say.
   The officials said one target of the raids is a food barge
donated by the Norwegian government to the International Committee
for the Red Cross. The barge has been located in the Nile River
adjacent to the southern Sudan town of Bor, a main transit point
for relief supplies, they said.
   ``I think it's almost unimaginable that a government facing a
(famine) disaster of epic proportions would have the audacity to
bomb food shipments at the same time they are asking for more food
assistance,'' said Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   Natsios and other officials said bombs have rained down on Bor
and other towns where international relief programs are in
operation. They are run by the World Food Program, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee
for the Red Cross.
   ---&equals;
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Theater owners and filmmakers are giving the
new movie rating NC-17 mixed reviews, saying it offers improvements
over the ruinous X rating but still may prove troublesome.
   The Motion Picture Association of America eliminated the X
rating on Wednesday, replacing it with NC-17, for no children under
17 admitted. It said the new label does not immediately carry the
commercial stigma of X.
   The MPAA also said it will give film companies and theater
owners more details on films it rates R, noting violence, sex and
language. The PG-13, PG and G ratings will remain the same.
   Universal Pictures' X-rated ``Henry &amp; June,'' a historical drama
featuring some sex scenes, will be the first film bearing the NC-17
rating, Universal said.

<HEAD>`Twin Peaks' Returns to the Air Waves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has not been a quiet week in Twin Peaks, the
enigmatic little lumber town in the Pacific Northwest where the
women are strange, the men are odd-looking, and the children are
all above suspicion.
   Lake Woebegon it ain't. ``Twin Peaks'' is not a place, it's a
state of mind to which millions of Americans will return Sunday
night for the season premiere of television's oddest nighttime
drama.
   After eight episodes - just seven days in Twin Peaks time - we
still don't know who killed Laura Palmer, the homecoming queen
whose plastic-wrapped corpse fuels the series' central mystery. She
is still dead. Maybe.
   Then there's wacky, cherry pie-gobbling FBI agent Dale Cooper
(Kyle MacLachlan). He has declared he knows the killer's identity
but, in the season finale, was laid low by an unknown assailant and
three gunshots to the chest.
   There's more. One suspect in Laura's killing has been smothered
by her father, another has been shot, there's been a heart attack,
a drug overdose, a life-threatening fire, and a brothel-keeper has
unknowingly hired his own daughter.
   As actor Michael Ontkean (Twin Peaks' doughty Sheriff Harry S.
Truman) observed, the series is ``a Kabuki-style Peyton Place on
peyote buttons.''
   ABC says little about the two-hour, special ``ABC Sunday Night
Movie,'' directed by David Lynch and written by Mark Frost,
co-creators of the series:
   ``The investigation into the mysterious killing continues,
sorrow settles over the community as several lives hang in the
balance,'' ABC said, ``Audrey Horne finds herself a terrified
prisoner, and Donna Hayward receives a strange message.''
   This is a strange time for a strange series.
   It was conceived by Lynch, the high priest of cinematic anxiety
(``Eraserhead,'' ``The Elephant Man,'' ``Dune,'' ``Blue Velvet''
and ``Wild at Heart'') and Frost, an established TV producer from
``Hill Street Blues.''
   A midseason replacement, ``Twin Peaks'' was the year's most
written-about show even before its April 8 debut won a 33 percent
share of the TV audience. It quickly became the most talked-about
show on television.
   ``We're just trying to reimagine the genre of the nighttime
soap, in the way that `Hill Street Blues' did the cop show a decade
ago,'' Frost said. But it was much more than that.
   Viewers got a sense of place in Twin Peaks, its geography and
exteriors provided by the lovely town of Snoqualmie, Wash. The town
was as placid as a forest pond where every droplet teems with
violent, microscopic life.
   The critics loved the show's dreamlike, allusive imagery, the
dazzling cinematography of Ron Garcia and the ethereal score of
composer Angelo Badalamenti.
   Most of all they loved the townspeople, mordantly eccentric
characters whose plots and subplots were cryptic to the point of
inscrutability.
   Every conversation had meaning, every gesture was freighted with
hidden significance, every scene charged with a sense that
something dreadful was about to happen. The tension wasn't
relieved, only punctuated by black comedy.
   There had never been anything like it on television.
   Even film critic Pauline Kael of The New Yorker magazine was
hooked: ``It has both the insidious weirdness of of Lynch's best
movie work and the weird insidiousness of top-of-the-line TV trash.
... Lynch sets us drifting through a vivid dream of American
life.''
   The New York Times adored ``Twin Peaks.'' ``Don't miss it,''
said one review. Its editorial page ventured that the series ``has
been hailed as revolutionary TV. It has become, in any case, a
phenomenon.'' Heady stuff, that.
   ``I killed Laura Palmer'' T-shirts appeared. Food writers
devoted columns to cherry pie. On Fridays, the show's ardent fans
would gather to analyze every clue and argue over meanings.
   Computer enthusiasts would bicker about the show on electronic
bulletin boards. Ordinarily sensible people who wouldn't admit to
watching ``thirtysomething'' became instant, babbling fans.
   Hailed as the television show of the '90s, ``Twin Peaks'' was
everything except a hit.
   Its opening audience share of 33 percent quickly slumped when
``Twin Peaks'' went to its regular time slot Thursday nights
against NBC's blockbuster ``Cheers.'' ``Twin Peaks'' gradually lost
about half of its viewers.
   The season finale won its time period with a 12.6 rating and a
22 share, or about 9.7 million viewers. A ratings point represented
921,000 TV households, a share the percentage of all TV sets in use
tuned to a given show.
   It finished the season with a respectable if unspectacular tie
for 40th place, but ABC already had decided to renew the show. On
Oct. 6 it moves to Saturday night with ``China Beach,'' the
critically acclaimed Vietnam war series.
   ABC says both shows attract adult viewers ages 18 to 49, a
demographic group prized by advertisers, about 40 million of whom
tune in on Saturday nights. ABC's secret fear is that ``Twin
Peaks'' will lose to rented videos.
   ``Twin Peaks'' fared poorly in the annual Emmy Awards, despite
its 14 nominations, the most of any drama. It won only two
technical awards.
   Daily Variety, the trade journal, blamed that on critics who
``may actually have done it a disservice, attaching expectations to
it that it will be hard-pressed to meet.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   TWIN PEAKS SIDEBAR ALERT!!! - VH-1 presents a visually stylish
documentary Saturday night on the collaboration of the ethereal
``Twin Peaks'' singer Julee Cruise, series composer Angelo
Badalamenti and producer-director David Lynch.
   It features interviews with the principals, clips from ``Twin
Peaks'' (but no clues to the series' mysteries) and excerpts from
their performance piece ``Industrial Symphony No. 1.''
   Diehard ``Peaks'' fans will not want to miss this. Put down that
log, lady.

<HEAD>Who Is Michael Milken?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is Michael Milken the selfless, quiet,
conservative, religious, civic-minded, philanthropic father,
husband and family man he is depicted in letters to the judge who
will sentence him?
   Or is he the greedy, power-seeking, conspiratorial, corrupt,
confessed criminal who systematically and fraudulently engaged in
illegal payoffs and other acts to gain a fabulous income, as
depicted by prosecutors?
   Hundreds of letters in support of Milken have been received by
Judge Kimba Wood, leading a reader to wonder if Michael Milken is
possessed of two utterly disparate personalities.
   That is only the beginning of the questions provoked by the
letters, all written in an effort to convince Wood that Milken
should be sentenced to less than the maximum term of 28 years, and
instead be ordered to assist in community projects.
   The letters, whch describe a private person so unlike the
public image of Milken, the confessed criminal, provide an unusual
psychological case study of human behavior and perception.
   There are letters from attorneys, for instance, that emphasize
Milken's personal values and contain nothing whatever about legal
issues.
   There is praise from beneficiaries of Milken's charities,
without reference to the possibility that the funds assigned to
them were obtained illegally.
   There are business people suggesting that Milken's values are so
unlike, and higher, than those of so many business people.
   And there are educators who tell of how Milken, by his personal
example and effort, is a positive influence on the education of
children.
   Daryl Gates, Los Angeles police chief, says he pursues a hard
line against criminals. He suggests the court could consider
Milken's financial expertise in arriving at a productive rather
than solely punitive sentence.
   Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony observes that his schools
seek to instill decent values in the lives of young students. He
asks that Milken be sentenced ``to enhanced community service''
rather than punished by jail.
   Richard Adler is a judge of the California Superior Court, but
his letter to Judge Wood refers only to Milken's character and his
ability as a mathematics teacher, including personal help he gave
to the judge's son.
   Steven J. Ross, chairman of Time-Warner Inc., is widely known as
a sharp, no-nonsense, hard-driving businessman. He writes that
Milken ``is no Ivan Boesky or Martin Siegel, no Gordon Gekko, no
yuppie, no wheeler and dealer.''
   Instead, he says, Milken ``is a person of ideas and ideals,''
and ``strangely immaterialistic,'' a ``long-term thinker, not a
quick-buck artist,'' a man who sometimes put client financial
interests ahead of his own.
   The letters are almost invariably long, far longer, rambling,
repetitive and anecdotal than ordinary business letters, but
otherwise unsually well presented. Ross' letter is five typwritten
pages, but others are twice that length.
   Almost all writers comment positively on an aspect of Milken's
personality and way of life - his loyalty, concern, love of
children, quiet family life, religious commitment, honesty, or
devotion to people and causes.
   Themes reappearing throughout the file of letters are that bad
things happen to good people, that the tragedy of human frailty can
destroy otherwise strong human beings, and the belief that good
deeds should mitigate penalties.
   Whatever is made of the letters now is likely to be magnified
and examined in detail after the sentence is pronounced, and one
question that will be asked over and over is whether the support of
the big would ever be so available to the small.

   Israeli soldiers are drawn as dogs and Jewish
settlers as rats toting rifles. As for the Arabs, they're depicted
as having sinister mustaches and jagged scars across their cheeks.
   The drawings are not the work of political cartoonists on one
side or other in the Arab-Israeli conflict. They are illustrations
for children's books meant to entertain and teach Palestinian or
Israeli youngsters.
   Professor Adir Cohen, author of a study of Herrew children's
literature called ``An Ugly Face in the Mirror,'' says such books
give birth to lifelong hatreds among Israelis and Palestinians.
   ``We learned from Freud how stories and fairytales enter our
subconscious. ... It infiltrates to those places of the
subconscious and comes up repeatedly,'' said Cohen, head of the
education department at Haifa University.
   He described Arabs in Hebrew children's books as having ``a huge
terrible mustache and scary eyes, the nose of an eagle ... a scar
and a narrow forehead.''
   ``We are talking about processes of dehumanization that are
connected to the (Arab-Israeli) struggle, connected to defense and
wars,'' he said. ``It is much easier to fight a roach.''
   Cohen used as an example the typical detective stories for young
boys - who in a few years will be soldiers - in which the Israeli
hero battles Arab murderers, bandits or terrorists.
   In Avner Carmieli's ``The Young Detectives Settle in the Wild
Negev,'' a young hero overcomes hundreds of Arabs, among them
kings. He lines up his prisoners and strides up and down shouting:
   ``Left, left - faster Gamal, Abdul, Nasser! Straighten your
backs Hussein and Faisel! Look front Nuri a-Said!''
   The book goes on to explain how ``the kings and dictators and
leaders marched forward quickly'' under his orders. The names used
are typically Arab, but Gamal Abdul Nasser was also the late
Egyptian president who was one of Israel's chief enemies.
   Many of the Hebrew books with such messages are aimed at boys in
their pre-teens. Similar Arab literature is intended for even
younger readers who in other societies might be reading about fairy
princesses.
   In Nasser Abed Alaltif's ``The Flower Beauty Queen,'' Jewish
settlers in the occupied West Bank are pictured as rats wielding
rifles. Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin curls his dragon claws
over an Arab village in Hamdan Yusef's ``The Sad Times of Deir
Yassin.''
   Khawla Abu Bakr, author of a study called ``The Political
Socialization of Palestinian Children by Means of Arab Children's
Literature,'' says West Bank children's books have as many
stereotypes as Israeli works.
   ``The (Israeli) soldier is always depicted as a wolf, a chicken,
an elephant, dogs,'' she said. ``Human figures are always seen as
bureaucrats, inconsiderate officials, police who break arms or
cruel soldiers.''
   Abu Bakr, an Arab Israeli from the Jewish-Arab seaside town of
Akko, defended the stereotypes of Israeli soldiers as a reflection
of the Arab children's daily life.
   For example, she said, a story by Rawdeh Alhodhod called ``The
Secret of the Red Devils In El Bire'' tells of Arab boys on a trip
who are arrested after one of them throws a stone at an army jeep.
   Youngsters often have been at the forefront of the Palestinian
uprising that began in December 1987. Thousands of youngsters have
been arrested, and 158 Palestinian children aged 16 and under have
died of Israeli army or civilian gunfire.
   Palestinian children's books also make references to the real
world. The Deir Yassin mentioned in Hamdan Yusef's book was an Arab
village where more than 200 Palestinian men, women and children
were massacred by Jewish militiamen in 1948.
   Another feature of the Arab children's books is a clearly stated
moral. The story of the arrested boys concludes: ``Our enemy is not
the boy but the soldier. ... (The boy) is a hero and did nothing
wrong to be punished for. You have to suffer and be a man.''
   Cohen agreed that the intefadeh, or Palestinian uprising,
enforces the message in the Palestinian books, but he noted many
were published before the revolt. ``No doubt, had we known how to
read this literature correctly years ago we would have seen how
they were preparing for the intefadeh,'' he said.
   For his study, Cohen examined more than 500 Hebrew works and
interviewed hundreds of Jewish children to determine the influence
of the books. Abu Bakr studied 300 books written in Israel, the
West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.
   Cohen said he hoped a new stream of Israeli children's
literature stressing coexistence would gain in readership. But he
added that adventure stories featuring Israeli heroes and wicked
Arabs remain more popular.
   Abu Bakr said stories without stereotypes are too much to expect
from an occupied people.
   She added that her favorite story was ``Hassan and the Monster''
by Taghred el Najer, which tells of a little boy who ignores
villagers' warnings and climbs a mountain to meet the one-eyed,
hairy monster who eats children.
   At the top, it's the monster who is frightened by the boy's
strange appearance - his two eyes and fair skin. Boy and monster
realize they can be friends, despite their differences and fears,
and they walk off together into the sunset.

   ``Yesterday he had been happy, but this sorrow - descending upon
him as it had the night before - seemed to have confounded him

   Late afternoon. William Styron looks tired,
slouched in a chair in his hotel room, his tie and jacket lying on
the bed. The air is hot and musty and the curtains are almost
completely drawn, blocking out the sun of a crisp September day.
   The author is making a two-day trip to New York to promote
``Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness,'' a brief chronicle of his
near-suicidal bout with depression, and eventual recovery.
   The night before, he appeared in a packed Manhattan auditorium
at the 92nd St. Y Poetry Center, reading one passage from his new
book and another from a novel in progress. He seemed comfortable
discussing his problems and expressed delight that his book had
temporarily knocked Donald Trump's latest opus from the top of
best-seller lists; the audience responded enthusiastically.
   But Styron was also anxious to finish, agreeing to a mere five
to six minutes of questions and checking his watch to make sure
that limit was not broken.
   At his hotel room, the author is again checking his watch. He
seems edgy, distracted, noting periodically he has to leave the
hotel at 5:15 p.m. sharp; that evening Vanity Fair is holding a
reception in his honor at the Century Club. His original article on
depression had first appeared in the magazine.
   ---
   ``I barely realized it but I was in a deep crisis. I actually
had ached so intensely over this wicked, this monstrous
disappoinment - this betrayal! - that a kind of quivering St.
Vitus' dance had begun to possess my limbs. ... I was suffering
from an anxiety attack which each one of my psychic monitors had
begun to regard gravely, flashing alerts all through my flesh.'' -
``Sophie's Choice.''
   ---
   ``Darkness Visible'' begins with a trip to Paris in the fall of
1985 when Styron realized his emotional difficulties of the past
several months ``might have a fatal outcome.''
   He soon broke down completely, unable to sleep or drive or write
and barely capable of speaking. Alcohol nauseated him (in the book
he admits to a history of heavy drinking and at the reading he said
he still enjoys a glass of wine), and the author was seized by
uncontrollable fits of anxiety.
   Anti-depressant medication prescribed by a psychiatrist only
worsened his condition. By early December he was ready to kill
himself - he couldn't even write a suicide note - but ``drew upon
some last gleam of sanity'' and checked into a hospital instead,
recuperating after a seven-week stay.
   ``I haven't had any real afteraffects for a long, long time,''
Styron insisted during the interview. ``It's over. I've tried to
make a point about it. Once it's over, it's over. Once people get
well, they're restored to the way they were before.''
   Other writers have suffered from depression including F. Scott
Fitzgerald and Sylvia Plath. Leo Tolstoy's midlife crisis led him
to become a devout Christian. Philip Roth writes about his problems
in ``Zuckerman Unbound'' and ``The Counterlife,'' and Camus' novel,
``The Fall,'' is a monologue by a depressed lawyer.
   William James in ``The Varieties of Religious Experience'' says,
``It is a positive and active anguish, a sort of physical neuralgia
wholly unknown to normal life.''
   Styron, 65, could easily pass for a senator or a head of state.
He is stocky and broad-shouldered, with a wide forehead, jowls,
nearly white hair and narrow eyes, pinched at the edges. His speech
is fluid, polished, the vowels clipped, the timbre rich.
   He is a man who likes to get things finished, done with. A
native of Newport News, Va., he knew in his late teens he wanted to
be a writer and was impatient to get his first book published.
   That came in 1951 with ``Lie Down in Darkness,'' a sprawling
novel influenced by William Faulkner and centered, ironically, on a
young woman's suicide.
   Styron has since become one of the most honored writers of the
past 40 years, winner in 1967 of the Pulitzer Prize for ``The
Confessions of Nat Turner'' and the American Book Award in 1979 for
``Sophie's Choice,'' which included a double suicide.
   But there has also been this nagging sense of unfinished
business. It started at age 13, the author said, with the death of
his mother. He became a ``hell raiser'' as a child, admitting now
he should have properly expressed his grief, allowed it to work its
way through his system.
   If there were any guilty feelings about his mother, Styron did
have a chance to make amends at an early age. He served as a
lieutenant in the Marines during World War II and in 1945 was
stationed in Okinawa. He was to take part in the invasion of Japan
and didn't expect to come out alive.
   The invasion never occurred; the United States dropped the atom
bomb instead.
   ``Some of my problems I think came from a continuing anguish
over my mother's death and if I had gotten shot it would have been,
I suppose, some kind of completion. It's hard to say how that would
have worked out,'' said Styron, who lives in Connecticut with his
wife. They have four children.
   ``When I was a young Marine platoon leader, there was this
incredible sense of fate. The myth at that age is you're going to
live forever. Well, I never believed that and my friends didn't. I
thought I was going to die.''
   Styron insists ``go with the flow'' is now his philosophy. ``The
world will roll merrily on without me if I stop writing,'' he says.
There are regrets about not having written ``Richard III,'' but the
author still looks back on a ``respectable'' body of work and
considers ``Darkness Visible'' a fitting way to put his troubles
behind him.
   ``One thing you do learn is that you're really at the whim of
forces beyond your control,'' he said. ``Most people think mental
health is something they're invulnerable to. They go through life
thinking it's something that happens to other people.''
   When the interview ends, Styron puts on his jacket, moves over
to the bed and sits for his picture to be taken, his wrist turning
for another look at the watch. It's 5:05 p.m.
   He doesn't shake hands, but shyly lowers his face and mumbles
goodbye, perhaps thinking about the evening ahead - or simply
looking forward to finishing this trip and going home.
   ---
   ``The grief is coming now, she said to herself: He's beginning
to know what suffering is. ... Perhaps that's good for a man -
finally to know what suffering is, to know what a woman somehow
knows from the day she was born.'' - William Styron, ``Lie Down in
Darkness.''

<HEAD>Current GATT Talks Help Shape Common Market Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever results from the ongoing
multinational trade talks in Geneva will help set the tone for the
European Community's new togetherness in 1992.
   If the talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
wind up on a liberalized note of international cooperation and good
will, the mood could prevail after the 12-nation EC further
integrates itself two years from now.
   At least that's the rough idea being tossed around by some
Agriculture Department analysts looking at the 1992 plan shaping up
to make the EC truly a common market in Europe.
   The current GATT talks, the so-called Uruguay Round of
negotiations, are scheduled to conclude at the end of this year.
   In many respects, the negotiations have been a snarling
confrontation between the United States, which wants to phase out
export subsidies and a bundle of other protectionist policies, and
the EC, which prefers less drastic remedies.
   Walter Gardiner of the department's Economic Research Service
says there has been a mixed reaction among Americans to Europe's
unification plan designed to make the bloc a true ``common market''
by the end of 1992.
   Many believe the EC will be an even more powerful bloc that will
mean greater competition for U.S. goods and services in Europe and
in foreign markets generally.
   ``The label `Fortress Europe' has been used by a number of U.S.
and other non-EC officials to describe the potential market and
investment environment that could emerge'' if non-member countries
don't pay close attention to developments, Gardiner said.
   Basically, he said, the plan is to ``remove all existing
internal barriers to the free movement of goods, services, people
and capital.'' That, Gardiner said, was what the community's
founders had in mind 33 years ago.
   Gardiner's analysis was described in the October issue of
Farmline magazine and in a paper published last summer by him and
two other economists, Steve Neff and David Kelch.
   Despite the hundreds of directives involved in developing the
1992 plan, there are no provisions for liberalizing any of the EC's
external trade barriers - the ones that affect the United States
and other trading partners.
   Any progress on that front will depend on the outcome of the
GATT talks in Geneva.
   ``However, the adjustments to investment, production,
consumption and trade patterns within the EC in response to the
large number of 1992 directives will be felt far beyond the EC's
borders,'' Gardiner said.
   There will be greater opportunities for those able to compete in
a deregulated EC economy, particularly those firms already doing
business there and who are making the necessary changes in
anticipation of 1992, he said.
   ``For companies such as equipment manufacturers that are
required to build as many as eight production lines for tractors
because of different regulations in EC countries, any harmonization
should be a welcome development,'' he said.
   Also, eliminating customs regulations at borders within the EC
should reduce significantly the cost of transporting goods within
the community, he said.
   But as of now, there are no clear indications whether the EC
will adopt standards and regulations more restrictive than those
now in place, or whether the EC may raise new barriers against the
goods of non-member countries.
   Gardiner said the EC and the United States ``share a number of
important economic relationships'' that indicate a high degree of
mutual dependence.
   For openers, he said, the United States and the EC are the
world's two leading economic blocs, accounting for about one-half
of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) and merchandise trade.
The GDP is the total of a country's goods and services.
   The United States is also a major EC investor, with $128.5
billion invested directly in 1988, or 39 percent of total U.S.
foreign investment. That represents a vast increase over the $20.1
billion invested in 1970, which was 27 percent of total U.S.
foreign investment at the time.
   Also, he said, ``The United States and the EC are each other's
largest trading partners, with two-way trade totaling $160.9
billion in 1988. U.S. mercandise exports to the EC have risen
sixfold, from $12.3 billion in 1970 to $75.9 billion in 1988.''
   In the same period, U.S. imports from the EC rose nearly
ninefold, from $9.7 billion to $85 billion.
   Agricultural trade is an important part of this trade, although
there were large fluctuations in the 1980s, Gardiner said. U.S.
agricultural sales totaled $2.3 billion in 1970, peaked at $11
billion in 1980 and then plummeted to $6.5 billion by 1985.
   ``With the weakening of the dollar relative to European
currencies near the end of 1985, farm exports began to recover
slightly in 1986, rising to $7.3 billion by 1988, but amounting to
only two-thirds of the record level set in 1980,'' he said.

   From Manila to Managua, from the Bronx to Brazil, the littlest
victims of poverty, disease and war suffer silently, but their eyes
tell the story. It is a litany of despair, of hunger and
homelessness and hopelessness.
   Every day somewhere in the world, 40,000 children die. Most
succumb to preventable diseases like measles and diarrhea. The rest
are victims of abuse, neglect, poverty, starvation and war.
   Amnesty International recently reported that police in Brazil
and Guatemala torture and summarily execute street children.
Hundreds of Iraqi children have been tortured or murdered by Saddam
Hussein's government. In Liberia, the government and its opponents
have killed or mutilated thousands of children. During states of
emergency in South Africa, an estimated 10,000 children were
detained without charge or trial, some for as long as a year.
   Millions of children in developing countries die each year from
diarrhea. By the year 2000, at least 10 million children will be
infected with the AIDS virus and another 10 million will by
orphaned by the fatal disease, the World Health Organization
estimates.
   As the problem has intensified, so has the call for action. Some
70 heads of state, including President Bush and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, gather at the United Nations in New
York this weekend to adopt a declaration making children one of
their highest national priorities.
   The Convention on the Rights of the Child calls for, among other
things, a one-third reduction in infant mortality by the end of the
decade; access to family planning for all couples and prenatal care
for all women; and immunization of 90 percent of children against
childhood diseases.
   In the United States, which has one of the worst infant
mortality and immunization rates among industrialized countries in
the world, about 40,000 children die each year before their first
birthdays. Last year, 2.4 million children were reported as
suspected victims of child abuse or neglect; about 400,000 of those
had been sexually abused.
   One of every five U.S. children lives in poverty. About 10
million have no health insurance.
   Every night, an estimated 100,000 American children go to sleep
homeless.

   In the 200th year since the birth of the First
Amendment, the winds of censorship are gusting stronger than ever.
This could be called the year of the censor.
   Federal support of arts projects deemed obscene has been
threatened; record store owners face fines and possible arrest for
selling LPs containing lyrics or artwork dubbed obscene; a rash of
movies have been slapped with the dreaded X rating; and a museum is
going on trial for obscenity - an American first.
   Already, the film industry is adjusting. The X rating was
eliminated Wednesday by the Motion Picture Association of America,
which substituted a new NC-17 rating that bars children altogether
but does not carry the stigma of the X.
   Throughout the history of the United States, censorship in one
form or another - political, religious, moral or military - has
stalked literature, dance, opera, film, music and art.
   This, the land of the fruited plain, home of the brave and
citadel of free speech, banned Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,''
took the wiggle out of Mae West's walk, cut the moaning from Ray
Charles' ``What'd I Say,'' burned James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' put
Lenny Bruce in jail and kept Isadora Duncan from dancing.
   Now the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati and its director,
Dennis Barrie, face misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and
displaying nude photos of children in an exhibit of photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe, a homosexual who died of AIDS last year. Jury
selection in a county court began last week.
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit last June at the Corcoran Gallery of Art
in Washington was canceled after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared
some of the artist's photographs to be obscene. Helms' objections
resulted in a move by Congress to limit federal funds to the arts.
   ``I wasn't starting out to make a statement, that isn't the way
I work,'' Mapplethorpe once said. ``The statement grows out of what
I do.''
   In 1979's ``Easter Lilies With Mirror,'' Mapplethorpe uses four
panels to form a cross around a center mirror. The lilies are shown
in dramatic shadows, a dusting of light illuminating their inner
and almost religious beauty. It is a way of engaging the viewer
beyond mere voyeurism; the viewer becomes a part of the work.
   But other works are disturbing, unraveling a violent homosexual
mystique for an unsuspecting audience. They are terrifying,
sadomasochistic tableaux - chained men, leather-bound men, men
prepared for pain in an aristocratic setting, anal sex games,
urination.
   Mapplethorpe's defenders cite the First Amendment, which says
that Congress ``shall make no law ... abridging the freedom or
speech, or the press. ...'' But courts have issued opinions back
and forth since 1791. In 1957, the U.S. Supreme Court gave its
first ruling on a definition of obscenity saying it could not be
protected by the First Amendment.
   Justice William Brennan, however, added: ``The portrayal of sex,
e.g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not sufficient
reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of
speech and press.''
   In 1973, the high court agreed to a new set of rules for states
to determine what was obscene. States could enact laws banning
artistic works if they portrayed sex ``in a patently offensive way,
and which taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.''
   In June, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the rap group 2
Live Crew's LP, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which speaks
graphically about sexual violence towards women, was obscene.
   Plays and playwrights have faced censorship in America:
   - In a Boston production of Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?,'' the character Martha bellowed at her husband,
``Jesus Christ, you're trying to hump the hostess.'' City censors
forced the playwright to change the line because it ``took the
Lord's name in vain.'' Said Martha in the rewritten version, ``Mary
Magdalene, you're trying to hump the hostess.''
   - The muted nudity in the Broadway smash ``Hair'' was challenged
in New York by a group of clergymen in 1968.
   - ``Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You'' incurred the
wrath of Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn when it ran there in 1984
because it discussed abortion and homosexuality.
   Music, too, has had its romp with censors. Elvis the Pelvis had
to be shot from the waist up when he appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show'' in 1956 so Americans wouldn't be offended by those gyrating
hips that helped make Presley famous. A decade later, Sullivan made
the Rolling Stones change the lyrics to their song, ``Let's Spend
the Night Together.'' They sang, ``Let's spend some time together''
instead.
   In 1967, Van Morrison had a hit with ``Brown-Eyed Girl,'' which
contained the line ``making love in the green grass.'' An alternate
version had to be made for objecting radio stations.
   Radio stations also demanded an alternate version to Lloyd
Price's ``Stagger Lee'': In one, two men have a fight playing cards
and one shoots the other; in the cleaned-up version, the men argue
but patch it up and ``are sore no more.''
   Jimi Hendrix had to take the naked women off his ``Electric
Ladyland'' LP about 20 years ago, and in 1968, the Stones were
forced to part with the graffiti-filled bathroom stall on ``Beggars
Banquet'' LP.

   But in no area has censorship so inflamed a passionate public as
in literature.
   According to the postmaster general of the United States in
1959, ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was ``an obscene and filthy
work'' that could not be sent through the mail. The ban was lifted
a year later.
   The post office burned 500 copies of ``Ulysses'' in New York in
1922, and the book, considered a literary masterpiece, was banned
until 1933. The novel, much of it written in stream of
conciousness, ripples with sex and sensuality:
   ``... and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and
then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and
first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he
could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like
mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.''
   Henry Miller's ``Tropic of Cancer'' and all of his other works
were banned in the United States until 1961.
   Theodore Dreiser's ``An American Tragedy'' was kept off the
shelves in Massachusetts. ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ``The Wizard
of Oz'' and works by Mark Twain and Stephen King have at one time
or another been removed from libraries.
   Movies also have been a target.
   As early as 1897, moralists railed against anything remotely
suggesting sex. Some movie theater owners put white stripes across
the screen when showing ``Fatima,'' a reel featuring a fully
clothed dancer wiggling her hips and shaking her breasts.
   There were censorship drives by clergymen to tell the public
what they should and should not see. And in 1922, Hollywood decided
to censor itself and made President Harding's campaign manager,
Will H. Hays, the head of the Motion Picture Producers and
Distributors of America. He reigned for 25 years until the current
ratings system came into being.
   The Hays Office initially held up ``Gone With the Wind'' because
of Clark Gable's famous exit line, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give
a damn.''
   As late as 1953, Otto Preminger's ``The Moon Is Blue'' earned a
Production Code ban for using such naughty words as ``virgin'' and
``mistress.'' Other terrible words appeared in ``Anatomy of a
Murder,'' such as ``contraception.''
   And in 1988, Martin Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ''
was called ``blasphemy'' by religious leaders.
   More recently, a rash of movies has earned the now defunct X
rating, including Pedro Almodovar's ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   Filmmakers hope the new rating will carry none of the
advertising and exhibition restraints of the X rating, which had
become synonymous with hard-core pornography and served no purpose
in evaluating artistic films best suited for adults.
   ``It's a great step,'' said Philip Kaufman, director of the
X-rated Universal Pictures film ``Henry &amp; June.'' The historical
drama, which features some explicit sex, was set for a ratings
appeal next week and will be the first recipient of the new NC
rating, which would bar children under age 17.
   ``I'm just really delighted that we can show this film uncut in
America and show the film the way I made it,'' Kaufman said. ``It
is not intended as a prurient film.''

<HEAD>Court Begins Term With Wealth of Controversial Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court begins its 1990-91 term
Monday with disputes looming over abortion counseling, fetal
protection, school desegregation and the war on drugs.
   There will also be a new face on the court this term - David H.
Souter.
   Among the cases to be heard this week, without Souter, are an
important desegregation battle from Oklahoma City and a big-money
showdown over punitive-damage awards.
   President Bush picked the conservative Souter, a federal judge
from New Hampshire, as the 105th member of the high court,
replacing its longtime liberal leader, Justice William J. Brennan.
   ``We see troubled times,'' said John Powell, chief lawyer of the
American Civil Liberties Union, in assessing the coming term. ``The
court has shown a willingness to reconsider and cut back hard-won
victories we thought were long over.''
   Souter, whose vote is seen as pivotal in abortion, affirmative
action and church-state relations cases, could pad Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist's working conservative majority. Souter's
nomination was endorsed Thursday by the Senate Judiciary Committee
and sent to the full chamber for confirmation.
   Abortion rights advocates who oppose his selection said Souter,
if given the chance, would provide the critical fifth vote to
overturn the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized
abortion.
   ``His adamant refusal'' in his Senate confirmation hearings ``to
be candid in the area of privacy and abortion can do nothing but
create the very reasonable and strong inference that he is prepared
to jettison established law,'' said Helen Neuborne of the National
Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   Under Supreme Court practice, Souter would not be able to
participate in cases argued before he joined the court. If the
justices find themselves split 4-4 on such a case, they could order
it reargued later in the nine-month term to let Souter cast the
deciding vote.
   The court already has agreed to decide 54 cases by July, when
its term will end, and probably will add 70 to 80 more in the
coming weeks.
   The first cluster will be added Monday, when the justices are
expected to issue orders in more than 1,000 appeals. The vast
majority will be rejected but some will be granted review by the
court.
   In one of its most closely watched cases, the justices must
decide whether federal regulations violate free-speech rights by
barring government-financed family planning clinics from offering
abortion counseling.
   At stake is the future scope of a $200 million-a-year federal
program that finances more than 4,000 clinics serving some 5
million low-income women.
   The family planning program, enacted by Congress as Title X of
the Public Health Service Act, forbids clinics from using federal
funds to perform abortions, although it originally let clinic
staffs tell women about the abortion option.
   But the Reagan administration in 1988 issued regulations that
say clinics receiving federal support may not ``encourage, promote
or advocate abortion as a method of family planning'' or even
distribute written materials on abortion.
   If a woman visiting such a clinic asks about abortion, the
regulations tell doctors and counselors to say the program ``does
not consider abortion an appropriate method of family planning''
and to offer help in obtaining prenatal care.
   The Senate last week voted to amend Title X to nullify the
regulations against abortion counseling. If the Senate action
becomes law, the court challenge of the regulations will become
meaningless.
   In a case that could affect millions of working women, the court
is reviewing an employer's policy of excluding all women of
childbearing age from some hazardous jobs.
   A fetal-protection policy used by Johnson Controls, a
Milwaukee-based battery manufacturer, bans women who cannot prove
they are infertile from jobs that expose them to lead. The policy
is being attacked as a form of illegal sex discrimination.
   Among those who sued were a 50-year-old divorcee and a woman who
submitted to sterilization to preserve her job.
   A federal appeals court upheld the policy by a 7-4 vote, but one
dissenting judge said 20 million industrial jobs may be closed to
women because ``many substances in addition to lead pose fetal
risks.''
   The Oklahoma City desegregation case asks whether school
districts may abandon mandatory busing and other court-ordered
plans after achieving racial balance in student populations.
   Hundreds of school districts, including those in most major
cities, operate court-ordered desegregation plans. Only a few have
persuaded courts to declare their once-segregated systems fully
integrated.
   Nevertheless, the potential impact of the court's ruling is
great. Critics say letting students attend neighborhood schools
will result in ``resegregation.''
   The court will confront one aspect of the war on drugs when it
reviews a Michigan law that imposes mandatory life sentences
without possibility of parole for people, even first-time
offenders, convicted of possessing certain amounts of drugs.
   A man convicted of possessing 23 ounces of cocaine and given
such a sentence says he received ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
His lawyers note that convictions for second-degree murder and
other violent crimes do not carry such stiff sentences.
   The justices were told that Michigan is the only state that
imposes such a mandatory sentence. If the law is upheld, other
states might follow Michigan's lead.
   Here, in summary form, are some of the other cases the court is
to decide this term:

   -Whether skyrocketing awards in personal-injury lawsuits and
other cases designed to punish and deter wrongdoing can go so high
they become inherently unfair. The court's decision in an insurance

business and consumers.

   -Whether a condemned killer who lost his sanity while on death
row is being subjected to ``cruel and unusual punishment'' by

attempt to make him sane enough to grasp that his execution is a
punishment for his crime.
   -Whether states may house condemned killers on death rows and
keep them apart from other prison inmates. A Nebraska inmate says
such segregation is unconstitutional.
   -Whether prosecutors who exclude blacks as jurors because of
their race violate the rights of white defendants. An Ohio court
said a 1986 Supreme Court decision barring exclusion of black
potential jurors applies only when the defendants are black.

   -Whether nonunion public employees may withhold financial
support from unions that represent them because some of the money
they contribute is used for activities unrelated to collective
bargaining. A federal appeals court ruled in a Michigan case that
public employee unions must be given more spending leeway than
those in private industry.
   -Whether the secretary of labor or a safety and health review
board has the last word on what is required by federal regulations
for on-the-job safety.

<BYLINE>Before Long, U.S.-Certified Organic Food Coming to Market
^By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MARION, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poster on Christine and Dale Johnson's
kitchen wall reads, ``Our Veggies Don't Do Drugs.''
   A jar on the kitchen table holds wasp eggs, future natural
predators to be used instead of pesticides against the tomato
hornworm - ``a nasty critter, a voracious eater,'' said Mrs.
Johnson.
   The Johnsons run an organic farm, growing peppers, squash, kale,
cherry tomatoes, eggplant, lettuce and other produce on their 65
acres on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay.
   Many people tell opinion surveys they are willing to pay more
for organic food, grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides
or insecticides.
   But growers, retailers, consumer groups and environmentalists
say the organic food industry has been handicapped by the lack of
consistent national standards to answer the question: What is
organic food?
   ``I think the consumer has the right to the assurance that the
organic label means something,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``The consumer
can often be deceived, possibly pay more for a product that's no
better than another.''
   Twenty-two states have regulations defining organic farming.
They all follow the same basic idea, but no two are identical. In
other states organic farms are certified by private organizations,
applying their own standards.
   ``Organic agriculture is a funny word. Organic by definition in
Webster's would just be carbon-based,'' said Joseph Dunsmoor,
founder of the organic food distributor Organic Farms in
Beltsville, Md. ``You can say organic agriculture means you don't
use farm chemicals. It's a whole lot more than that.''
   But what?
   This year Congress is taking a stab at an answer. The House and
Senate both approved programs for nationwide organic farming
standards as part of the 1990 farm bill.
   The conference committee that will resolve differences between
the two bills is waiting for a budget deal so it knows how much
money has to be cut from farm support programs, but the organic
provisions are expected to survive.
   ``Organically produced food defies simple definition,'' the
Senate Agriculture Committee said when it adopted its version. So a
complicated definition was offered.
   ``Organic food is food produced using sustainable production
methods that rely primarily on natural materials,'' the committee
began. There are exceptions - some synthetic chemicals
traditionally accepted in organic farming, and a few natural
substances so toxic they are banned.
   Those exceptions are to be spelled out in a list drawn up by a
National Organic Standards Board, to be made up of organic farmers,
wholesalers and retailers, consumer representatives and
environmentalists.
   Rules for raising organic meat and poultry are even more
confusing than for vegetables. It's left to the standards board to
figure out what livestock medications, vaccines and parasiticides
are to be legal for organic farmers.
   Within two years, shoppers should be seeing U.S.
government-certified organic chickens, tomatoes and bell peppers in
the stores.
   The legislation allows for state and private organizations to do
the inspection and certification, so long as they follow the
national standards. States also would be permitted to enact
stricter standards, if they wished, but could not block imports of
nationally certified organic food from other states.
   The organic farming provisions were backed vigorously by
lobbyists from environmental groups, who say overuse of chemical
pesticides, fungicides and fertilizers is polluting streams and
endangering farm workers.
   Chemical manufacturers reject any suggestion their products are
unsafe, but approve the idea of nationwide standards for organic
agriculture, said Christopher Klose, spokesman for the National
Agricultural Chemicals Association.
   The small but growing organic farm industry also supported the
plan for nationwide standards and labeling.
   ``For both the consumer and the grower, there are going to be
multiple benefits. It makes marketing much easier,'' said Marty
Rice, co-director of the Maryland Organic Food and Farming
Association, which was founded last year.
   Dale Johnson, driving boxes of organic kale in from his fields
in a white pickup, said he hoped the government-approved organic
labels will boost the market for organic foods.
   ``People say they want it and are willing to pay more for it,
but that hasn't translated into a bigger market on the East
Coast,'' he said.
   Supermarkets, however, report falling interest in organic foods.
   ``A lot of consumers will buy it one time for the novelty, but
the repeat sales don't seem to be there,'' said Nancy Yanish,
director of agricultural relations for the Food Marking Institute
in Washington. ``If consumers want it, supermarkets will be glad to
sell it.''
   Two major grocery chains in the Washington area, Giant and
Safeway, once had organic produce sections in some of their stores.
Both dropped the idea in the past year after disappointing sales.
   The trade weekly Supermarket News reported similar experiences
nationwide, asking in an article last May, ``Is organic produce
withering on the vine?''
   Organic farm organizations, however, report their production up
by as much as 40 percent over last year. Stores specializing in
natural and organic foods seem to be doing fairly well, even if
organic sales in regular supermarkets are slumping.
   ``In the last five years we've gone from a fad to a clear market
niche,'' said Bob Scowcroft, executive director of the California
Certified Organic Farmers. ``The establishment of national
standards will allow our growers to compete fairly in all 50
states.''

<HEAD>Sustainable Agriculture: Using Only the Chemicals You Really,
Really Need</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somewhere between smaller chemical-free
organic farms and giant corporate cultivators that use tons of
pesticides a year is an idea that's getting a lot of attention.
   The professionals call it low-input sustainable agriculture.
   What it means is using only the chemicals you really need.
   In general, organic farming requires total abstinence from
chemical fertilizers or pest control. Sustainable agriculture
provides a way to cut back on chemicals through better soil
monitoring technology, mechanical weed control, crop rotation and
what's known as integrated pest management.
   Sound reasonable?
   Some parts of the agriculture industry are being dragged along
kicking and screaming. They say that thanks to fertilizers and
pesticides, a single acre can produce several times the crops of
the same acre 40 years ago.
   Furthermore, say farmers interviewed by investigators for
Congress' General Accounting Office, the government's subsidy
programs discourage the sustainable approach by linking payments to
certain crop yields that require chemicals to be maintained.
   This means that unless the law is changed, farmers will continue
to push for high production of cotton, soybeans, corn and wheat
year after year, even though these crops are associated with soil
erosion and the chemicals used on them are damaging ground water in
some states.
   ``We must encourage farmers to combine responsible stewardship
of natural resources with farm profitability,'' Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, said during debate on the 1990 farm bill, ``but
we cannot ignore the bottom line in agriculture any more than you
can ignore the bottom line in any business.''
   Grassley tried unsuccessfully to change language in the 1990
farm bill calling for reduced chemical use.
   The Senate bill approved July 27 authorizes $40 million a year
to pursue sustainable agriculture programs, provide material to
farmers who want to learn more about the methods and requires
extension agents to take courses so they can teach farmers about
it.
   And new provisions allow for slightly more crop rotation.
   The House bill, approved Aug. 1, has similar language.
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said his organization is not opposed to sustainable
agriculture.
   ``We are part of the mix,'' said Vroom. ``We don't think farmers
should just use our products without looking for other things.''
   Garth Youngberg, director of the Institute for Alternative
Agriculture, says farmers eventually will have little choice but to
pursue sustainable methods.
   ``We no longer can concentrate solely on producing more,'' he
said. ``We didn't have data on ground water 10 years ago. We have a
lot of that now. It's getting to the point where people see that we
really have a problem here.''

<HEAD>Ron Brown: Looking for Ways To Pick a Democrat Who'll Win in 1992</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One quiet step at a time, the Democratic Party
chairman has been trying to tailor presidential nominating rules
that might just fit a winner for a change. Now he envisions an
old-fashioned new look in 1992, one in which he and other party
leaders would screen the candidate field, coaxing strong Democrats
in and, perhaps, urging divisive ones out.
   It is ``a role with some risk,'' said Democratic National
Chairman Ronald H. Brown, understating the case. It also is a role
reversal, since Brown's last candidate client was Jesse Jackson, in
1988, when he helped negotiate party rules that went in the
opposite direction.
   Actually, the turnabout may give him options his predecessors
didn't have. As the first black chairman of a national party, and a
1988 Jackson manager, Brown can hardly be accused of trying to rig
the system against Jackson now that he seeks ``a major role in
trying to shape the process...'' in 1992.
   ``I think you've got to do it in concert with Democratic members
of the House and Senate, and governors, and old hands at politics
in this country,'' Brown said in an interview. ``I think, frankly,
maybe some major financial supporters of candidates may have to be
involved.''
   To political veterans, that sounds familiar. That's the way it
used to be done before the Democrats overhauled their process in
the name of reform, and took away the clout of the political
professionals.
   In the 20 years since, they've lost four out of five
presidential elections. That's not all due to the system; as Brown
said, ``there are a lot of reasons that are not related to the
process at all.''
   But it hasn't helped.
   Before reform, the presidntial primaries were a testing ground,
in which presidential candidates would try to show their strength
far from home, to show party leaders and delegates that they could
be November winners. Now the primaries are the arena in which
nominees are chosen; there were 36 of them in 1988.
   That preliminary competition tends to force candidates toward
the left, and to lock them into positions that can be liabilities
in the final campaign for the White House.
   Democratic rules also tend to keep candidates in the race.
Because nominating delegates must be assigned in proportion to
primary election showings, losers get their weekly share and an
early decision on the nominee is almost impossible to gain.
   ``What I'd like to do ... is get a consensus candidate early in
the process and start running against George Bush rather than
against each other,'' Brown said.
   Brown said he doesn't want to go back to the smoke-filled room,
but he does want pragmatic, common-sense politics.
   Those have not been Democratic hallmarks. They weren't showing
in Atlanta in 1988, when the winner, Michael Dukakis, agreed to
rules concessions for 1992 in order to gain the backing of the
loser, Jackson.
   Brown, as Jackson's convention manager, helped fashion that
unity pact. Brown, as party chairman, has changed much of it.
   The Democrats had set aside a bloc of convention seats, and
therefore nominating votes, for elected officials and party
leaders, free of commitments to any candidate. That reserved some
muscle for the old guard. At Jackson's behest, the number of
uncommitted super-delegates was to have been cut next time. He
wanted more power in the primaries, and he also wanted something
close to pure proportional representation, without the requirement
that a candidate get 15 percent of a state's votes to win any of
its delegates.
   A year ago, the Democratic National Committee voted to seat a
full roster of 303 super-delegates at the 1992 convention, and
reinforced the 15 percent threshold for candidates to gain primary
election delegates. Meeting this month, the committee added another
80 appointed delegates for 1992.
   That's been done without controversy. The steps Brown now
envisions are an invitation to controversy, and he knows it. People
who think they ought to be president are not inclined to leave the
field quietly because party leaders tell them to, or suggest to
their supporters and donors that it's time to quit. They're more
likely to start protesting that kingmakers and bosses are trying to
force them out.
   ``You would have to do it very carefully,'' Brown said. ``...We
still have a caucus and primary system where the voters are the
final arbiters. This is not going to be a ham-handed approach.''

<HEAD>Scientists Try To Teach Computers To Read</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While computer scientists consider ways to
make Americans more computer literate, a university professor is
trying to make America's computers literate.
   Teaching computers to read involves teaching them to ``think''
like humans - by learning from experience and making educated
guesses. But what most people learn easily at age 6 is proving far
more difficult for computers.
   Humans ``don't just do character recognition. We don't just look
at one thing,'' said Sargur Srihari, a professor at the State
University of New York's Buffalo campus. ``It's going to be many,
many years before computers can read documents such as handwritten
letters.''
   For now, Srihari and his team of about 30 assistants would be
satisfied if the computer could read the addresses on the envelopes
those letters came in. So would the Postal Service, which is
supporting their project with a $2.1 million grant.
   The central post office in Buffalo, for example, must sort up to
3.3 million pieces of mail a night. Its existing equipment could
process up to 42,000 letters an hour - if the addresses were
perfectly printed. But those machines reject more than 30 percent
of the mail as unreadable, said Dennis Wnuk, a postal operations
officer in Buffalo.
   ``Primarily, what our optical character readers can read is
business-type mail, preprinted mail,'' Wnuk said. ``The average
piece of mail that a residential customer will put into a
collection box, we'll only read about 25 percent of those - and
that's only if he prints very well or happens to have a
typewriter.''
   Business mail is also a problem if it comes in a gaudily printed
envelope, if the address is too high, or if it is folded so that
part of the letter shows through the window along with the address,
said John Gullo, an automation and readability specialist at the
post office.
   ``People who use printers, they don't like to change the ribbon
because they want to get every last address out of the ribbon. That
gives us trouble,'' he said.
   The first major problem facing Srihari's team is to find the
address itself - simple for humans, but bewildering for computers
that must separate the address from the ``noise'' on such things as
magazine covers and junk-mail envelopes.
   The SUNY computer zeroes in on text blocks with the proper shape
- those with lines flush to the left, for example - and has already
achieved a 90 percent success rate.
   Next, the computer must figure out as much of the written
address as possible.
   To recognize a `2,' for example, a computer could be taught to
look for ends in the top center and lower right, a curve in the
upper right and a sharp `V' bend in the lower left, said Alan
Commike, a graduate student who is handling the number-recognition
aspect of the project.
   The problem is that there are so many different ways to write
numerals that 130 of those rules are needed to sort them all out.
   ``There are twos with holes,'' or loops instead of points,
Commike said. ``There are fives with hats, fives without hats.
There are British sevens and American sevens.''
   The next step is to teach the computer to make educated guesses
to fill in unreadable blanks. For example, if the street address is
not entirely legible, the computer narrows it to a few
possibilities by matching the part it can read against a list of
all strees and numbers in that particular ZIP code.
   ``This is what is called using contextual information . . .
bringing knowledge to bear, which is what people do,'' Srihari
said.
   Srihari's computers can now read about 75 percent of handwritten
ZIP codes; current postal equipment can read only about 5 percent
of them. But the new process is painfully slow - up to a minute for
each piece of mail.
   Speeding it up will require specially designed hardware, and is
18 months or more away, he said.
   The researchers are testing their equipment with the real thing.
   ``We had a team of undergraduates working nights in the Buffalo
post office,'' Srihari said. ``We didn't delay anybody's mail. We
just took it for a few minutes, captured it and put it in our
database.''
   Eventually, Srihari said, the technology will have a variety of
applications. For example, a busy newspaper reader could feed his
paper into the computer, which would cull out only those stories of
interest to him. Office workers could do the same with memos.
   Similar ``videotex'' systems were never very successful. And the
prediction that computers would eventually create a paperless
office was wrong: if anything, computers have made offices even
more papery.
   Srihari said his project could someday give people the best of
both worlds: they could have their paper and computerize it, too.
   ``People are not going to get away from hard copy. People like
to have hard copy,'' he said. ``It's something tangible. It's nice
to be able to take it somewhere.''

   Ramesh Jain is building a computer
database so complicated it might seem like child's play.
   The University of Michigan researcher says his work is too early
in development to predict its success, but it will debunk the myth
that a computer database has to consist of words or numbers.
   How about pictures?
   Most existing computers recognize only keyboard symbols, not
images that are scanned into their memory.
   ``The computer we are designing will do that,'' Jain said. ``You
can ask questions about pictures using pictures. It's just the
research of a new area. All the databases are not in terms of names
or numbers, they're in shapes.''
   Jain, director of the school's artificial intelligence lab, said
the program could eventually be used in classrooms, police labs,
real estate offices and museum warehouses.
   In class, for example, students could use databases to identify
leaves in botany education. A tree leaf they couldn't identify
could likely be matched by the computer comparing it to shapes,
colors, sizes and textures in its memory.
   Karen Brady, an artist in the school's multimedia lab, is using
a sample database with pictures of Oriental rugs. A computer
scanner copies the image of each rug into the computer's memory.
   The computer is programmed to recognize rug features including
overall design, patterns of the main and minor borders and color
schemes. Sample rugs can be identified by the computer by matching
them with such features in its memory.
   The amount of information requires huge amounts of computer
memory, Jain said. He is starting the project on Apple MacIntoshes,
but expects to graduate to larger systems.
   Some existing databases are based on images, but none works
directly with the pictures, Jain said.
   At the Michigan State Police Crime Laboratory in East Lansing,
unidentified fingerprints from crime scenes can be matched to
suspects through images in police files.
   But the program does not exclusively work with the images, said
Robert Slick, a latent fingerprint examiner at the lab. Instead,
the computer assigns numerical values to characteristics of the
fingerprint and searches the values in its memory for a match.
   ``Depending on the level of technology he's using, it could be
used in other areas as well,'' Slick said. ``I would think that it
could even be used in the identification of people. That's pure
speculation but the sky's the limit in technology.''
   Jim Blackaby, acting executive director of the Museum Computer
Network in Syracuse, N.Y., says image storage is important to
museums because it saves wear and tear on collections.
   By having images on file, researchers can call them up on the
screen instead of pulling them out of storage.
   While copies of paintings and sculptures already are filed on
computers, they cannot be retrieved by specifying an image without
the key word that describes it, Blackaby said.

<HEAD>Guide to Low-Fat Eating in Restaurants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the hardest times to stick to a low-fat
diet is when confronted with a restaurant menu. What's really in
all those dishes described so temptingly? Since the average
American eats several meals a week away from home, it's important
to know.
   A new pocket-size book can provide some guidance. The ``Guide to
Low-Cholesterol Dining Out'' by Harriet Roth (Signet, $1.95),
focuses not only on the animal products that contain cholesterol
but on high-fat foods that can raise the level of cholesterol in
the body.
   Roth advises diners to ask questions and make requests (such as
sauce on the side). More and more restaurants are willing to comply
with health-conscious eaters' wishes, said Roth, former director of
the Pritikin Longevity Center Cooking School.
   There are general guidelines and lists of foods to enjoy and
avoid at 17 kinds of restaurants, in take-out foods, among
beverages and when traveling. She also includes a brief list of
requests (such as ``I am on a special low-fat, low-cholesterol
diet.'') in French, Spanish, Italian and German.

<HEAD>Behavioral Problems Shorten Survival of Alzheimer's Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alzheimer's victims who suffer behavioral
problems such as paranoia and hallucinations tend to live about two
years less than those who do not, according to a published report.
   A shortened lifespan also was associated with hearing loss and a
later onset of the disease, the University of Washington
researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
   The study confirmed earlier findings that wandering and falling,
a common problem among Alzheimer's patients, reduces lives by about
three years.
   The report ``suggests that we should try to improve the quality
of survival and prevent the excess of disability,'' said the
study's author, Dr. Eric Larson.
   Alzheimer's progressively strips a person's ability to deal with
and understand events and people, complete household chores and
even take care of oneself. No cause or cure is known.
   According to a recent report by Congress' Office of Technology
Assessment, about 1.8 million Americans have Alzheimer's so severe
that others must care for them constantly. An additional 1 million
to 5 million have mild or moderate dementia.
   Patients live an average of five to eight years after being
diagnosed with Alzheimer's, according to the researchers.
   The study followed 126 Alzheimer's patients in their late 70s
for at least six years. Several factors, including depression, use
of prescription drugs, loss of appetite and restlessness did not
affect the patients' survival, the study showed.
   The scientists said they hope their work will be used to develop
accurate forecasts of the disease's course.
   Creighton Phelps of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Disorders Association in Chicago said the group planned to
disseminate the study to its chapters.
   ``This information, linking behavioral problems to shorter
survival, is something we didn't know before,'' he said.

   Prosecutors laid out a shrill portrait of
Michael Milken in documents they released, depicting the convicted
financier as an unapologetic schemer, more evil than Ivan Boesky
and deserving of a much harsher prison term.
   ``Milken's crimes formed a pattern of calculated fraud, deceit
and corruption of the highest magnitude,'' they said in a 200-page
memorandum to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is to sentence
Milken on Monday. ``Put simply, Milken's crimes were crimes of
greed, arrogance and betrayal.''
   The government, in the documents released Wednesday, did not
prescribe a specific sentence for Milken.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A flurry of rumors in the futures market sent
oil prices on a rally, pushing prices briefly above $39 per barrel.
   The surge of more than $1 a barrel Wednesday afternoon erased
losses in the morning that came largely on factual statistics.
Figures from the American Petroleum Institute showed that the
United States had bigger stockpiles of heating oil and gasoline
last week.
   But the gossip on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange
helped push light sweet crude for November to a high of $39.05 per
barrel before it settled back at $38.67, up $1.14 from Tuesday.

   CHICAGO (AP) - The White House, claiming there was `no
justification'' for the recent run-up in oil and gasoline prices,
announced Wednesday that president Bush had decided to sell 5
million barrels o crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The decision to tape the nation's oil reserve was announced by
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the decision to put 5 million barrels on the
market was a ``test'' and the president would take ``additional
steps to stabilize energy prices.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Durable goods orders to U.S. manufacturers
slid 0.8 percent in August, according to a government report that
analysts said indicated cutbacks in business investment plans
because of Middle East uncertainties.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that orders for
durable goods - ``big-ticket'' items expected to last more than
three years - totaled a seasonally adjusted $127 billion after a
revised 2.7 percent gain in July.
   Analysts pointed to a 11.2 percent drop, to $35.4 billion, in
non-defense capital goods orders, which often are a barometer of
business plans to expand and modernize.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August,
the government said in a report indicating personal consumption
remained reasonably strong despite the Persian Gulf oil-price
shock.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that spending totaled
$3.69 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up $16.7
billion from a month earlier. It was the smallest advance since
May, when spending was unchanged from April.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A year at college will cost an average of 5
percent to 8 percent more this fall, a slight lessening in the
decade-long spell of higher education inflation, according to an
annual survey.
   But some officials fear that encouraging news may end soon,
especially at colleges in oil-sensitive northern states, if the
overall inflation rate worsens and a recession occurs.
   The survey, released Wednesday by the College Board, also found
that Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the nation's priciest
college this fall: an estimated $22,945, counting tuition, fees,
room and board, books and supplies, transportation, and other
expenses.

   DETROIT (AP) - A new labor agreement containing three years of
income guarantees for about 300,000 General Motors Corp. workers
appeared headed toward certain ratification by the United Auto
Workers union.
   Even UAW Local 594 at GM's Truck &amp; Bus Group plant in Pontiac,
Mich., a center of support for the UAW dissident New Directions
Movement, voted 77 percent in favor of the contract in ratification
balloting Wednesday.
   At other locals, ratification margins were much higher - as much
as 98 percent, for example, among production workers at GM's
Arlington, Texas, assembly plant.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush may be willing to drop his
demand for a cut in the capital gains tax, Republican congressmen
said, a compromise that could spur a budget agreement and avert
disruptive cuts in government services.
   Bush said nothing about his reported change in position as he
campaigned Wednesday for Republican candidates in Ohio. Instead, he
said ``the hangup is with the Democrats,'' whom he accused of
refusing to do their part to cut the deficit.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration wants to raise deposit
insurance fees for reckless banks and limit how many insured
accounts a depositor may have, a senior Treasury Department
official said.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber also suggested
Wednesday that the administration may seek to force banks to
conduct commercial real estate lending through separate affiliates
that would not use insured deposits.

   If the chief executive officer of a major
company ran his business affairs in the same manner as the federal
government does, he would lose his job.
   There is almost no question this would be his fate because the
board of directors, answerable to the shareholders, would be
compelled to ask why, for example, he was unaware of the company's
poor financial condition.
   And he wouldn't have a good answer.
   They would ask why he made decisions based on inaccurate
information, why his flow of information was inadequate, why it
took so long to assemble, why he failed to take action until months
after the problems had become crises.
   The federal government has fought the problem but it hasn't
succeeded, and elected and appointed officials still must make
decisions on the basis of insufficient or unreliable information.
   In the second quarter, based on the best evidence available to
the Commerce Department in late July, the economy expanded at an
annual rate of 1.2 percent -weak, but still strong enough to
convince officials to refrain from taking action.
   This week, three months after the second quarter ended, it
became known to the President that the economy had been failing in
that period, just skirting recession, growing at a bare four-tenths
of a percent.
   The White House expressed surprise and concern, and Michael
Boskin, the White House chief economic adviser, conceded the
economy was now on a weaker path than had been known. The
administration halved its earlier projections.
   While the Federal Reserve has its own data retrieval methods, by
means of which it seeks to anticipate and fine-tune the economic
direction, it too must have been surprised by the tardy news. You
can't foresee with ancient data.
   The situation points up the problem of running an economy so
huge that data cannot be assembled in time to act. Not only does
its collection take time, but when assembled it is incredibly
complex, making it subject to revision.
   It is such a revision that now reveals the April-June economy
was tripping on a tightrope rather than steady on its feet as
officials had believed, in spite of fears expressed by private
economists and business people.
   The problem has existed since economic statistics were first
gathered, but it becomes more serious when the economy is walking
the line between recession and expansion, as it is now, or when
efforts are made to fine tune.
   Fine tuning, defined more by the attempt than the
accomplishment, seeks to deal with the economy over shorter periods
of time than is usually the case - by the month or even week, for
example, rather than the quarter or the year.
   In the Federal Reserve's area of authority it would mean keeping
an especially close watch, among other things, on the money supply
and interest rates, which of course rely on accurate measurements
of economic activity.
   Generally speaking, economists both in and out of government
have no choice but to use official statistics in analyzing business
and economic conditions, but some private-sector economists have
recently complained about inaccuracies.
   Some, in fact, have devised their own computer-aided techniques
for gathering and analyzing information, hoping to make themselves
less reliant on the official statistics.
   The latest revision, however, is an extremely critical one that
presents a brand new perspective and forces changes in forecasts
throughout government and industry, and it will add to the
complaints.

   Lessons learned in the 1973 Arab oil embargo have
helped Japan weather the gulf crisis, even though danger lurks in
the form of plummeting stock prices and rising interest rates.
   Nearly two months after Iraq invaded Kuwait, gasoline prices are
up only slightly in Japan, and there is little sign of the grave
concern that might be expected from a country that relies on the
Middle East for 70 percent of its oil.
   That's largely a result of the government's efforts to avoid a
repeat of 1973, when Japan's economy was thrown into chaos through
Arab restrictions of oil exports and imports that tripled in price
within months.
   At the time, the ``oil shock'' sent inflation spiraling and led
to the first decline in Japan's gross national product during the
post-war era.
   Japanese recall how they rushed to stores to buy toilet paper,
kerosene and other commodities amid fears of shortages. The crisis
atmosphere was heightened by emergency conservation measures that
pulled the plug on neon lighting and closed gasoline stations on
holidays and Sundays.
   But there have been no such scenes this time around.
   ``The major reason is that the government has a deliberate
policy of not causing panic,'' said Gregory Clark, a professor at
Sophia University specializing in the Japanese economy. That policy
is aimed at dampening expectations of inflation.
   Japanese ministries have kept a close eye on companies' plans to
raise fuel prices to the consumer. Oil wholesalers have raised
prices only once during the crisis, and only after the government
demanded they narrow the increase.
   Meanwhile, the powerful Ministry of International Trade and
Industry on Tuesday asked wholesalers of liquefied petroleum gas to
absorb higher costs by streamlining operations and limiting price
increases to the minimum, the Kyodo News Service reported.
   Japan is also less vulnerable to another ``oil shock'' because
it has reduced its dependence on foreign oil for its overall energy
needs from about 75 percent to under 60 percent, according to a
Western energy analyst.
   For further protection, the country has built up a 144-day
reserve of oil. Japan also has been purchasing additional supplies
from Saudi Arabia and Iran since the international embargo on Iraq
and Kuwait began in early August.
   ``So far, we have enough supply and enough stock to cover the
loss, so I don't think we have serious problems in the short run,''
said Hideki Matsumoto, a senior economist at the private Institute
of Energy Economics Japan.
   He said the government may draw from that stockpile in winter,
when demand for petroleum products increases.
   In the longer term, however, continuing uncertainty in the gulf
and sharply increased oil prices pose threats to the world's No. 2
economy, so strong that it has grown each month for nearly four
years.
   The stock market, which was already bearish, has slid 28 percent
since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. On Wednesday, the 225-share
Nikkei Stock Average dropped 4.75 percent to end the day at
22,250.62, its lowest closing level since Jan. 5, 1988.
   Japanese commercial banks, with their large share portfolios,
have been hit particularly hard. The reduced value of those assets
rendered some banks unable to meet international reserve
requirements that become mandatory in two years. Analysts say this
could lead to reduced lending overseas.
   Economists are particularly worried about accelerated interest
rate growth and inflationary pressure since the crisis began.
   Retail costs of petroleum products are likely to increase in
larger and more frequent increments if the crisis persists. ``The
real blow will be the price hike of petroleum-related products,
which will surface before the end of the year,'' predicted Josen
Takahashi, chief economist at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
   Perhaps most ominous is the possible effect of rising interest
rates on the expensive Japanese realestate market.
   Although Japan is only 4 percent the size of the United States,
its real estate is estimated at nearly four times the total value
of U.S. real estate - about $15 trillion. Land prices climbed 13
percent in the 12 months ending in July according to one government
survey.
   Some analysts believe the interest rate increases could force
land speculators to sell their holdings and burst the real estate
bubble.
   A collapse of the real estate market, said Clark, would ``have
staggering effects on this economy'' and could lead to a lengthy
recession.
   So far, said Clark, the government has done well to avert the
inflationary scare of the 1973 oil shock.
   ``What they can't control is the period over which interest
rates remain high,'' he added. ``And this is what's going to make
or break this economy.''

<HEAD>Even Dissident UAW Members Like New Deal With GM</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even dissident United Auto Workers members seem
to like the union's new deal with General Motors Corp., making
ratification of the three-year contract a virtual certainty.
   A suburban Detroit UAW local active in the New Directions
Movement, which voiced the only organized opposition to the GM-UAW
contract, voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to ratify the pact.
   ``This is the first one we've ratified in nine years,'' said
Howard Farnsworth, a shop committeeman at UAW Local 594 at GM's
Truck &amp; Bus Group plant in Pontiac.
   His local, which voted to reject tentative agreements in 1984
and 1987, approved the 1990 agreement, 77 percent to 23 percent.
``Finally we get to ratify one here at 594,'' Farnsworth said.
   Voting on the proposed agreement, which contains three years of
income guarantees for about 300,000 GM workers, continues through
the weekend. Some large locals at assembly and stamping operations
scheduled votes for today, tonight and Friday.
   Other locals approved the contract by much wider margins than
did Local 594.
   Production workers at Local 276 at GM's assembly plant in
Arlington, Texas, for example, approved the contract by a 98
percent margin and workers at Local 549 at GM's stamping plant in
Marion, Ind., approved the contract on a 95 percent vote.
   The union said it would release results at the end of the month,
after ballots from all 155 locals at GM plants are counted.
   After the GM-UAW pact is ratified, the union will announce
whether it will resume bargaining next with Ford Motor Co. or
Chrysler Corp. UAW contracts with the Big Three automakers,
covering more than 450,000 active workers, expired at midnight
Sept. 14, although provisions of the agreements have been extended.
   Meantime, the Canadian Auto Workers union on Wednesday set an
Oct. 10 deadline for reaching a new contract with General Motors of
Canada Ltd. On Sunday, the union said its 12,800 members ratified a
new three-year contract with Ford of Canada after a one-week
strike.
   The two unions, which split in 1985, say the contract they reach
first will be used as a pattern for agreements with other
automakers.
   UAW members contacted this week have said one of the big selling
points was a GM promise to pay up to $4 billion to guarantee wages
for workers laid off more than 36 weeks during the next three
years.
   Other apparently well-received contract provisions include
health care benefits that stay the same and increases in pension
plans.
   The UAW had tapped job security as its top issue. Guaranteeing
income is seen as the next best thing to guaranteeing jobs.
   ``Anytime you guarantee every soul in GM a job or income for
three years, it's good,'' said Oscar Bunch, president of Local 14
at GM's Hydra-Matic plant in Toledo, Ohio.

   The two German economies, the juggernaut and
the wheelchair, have little to do with each other three months
after they merged.
   It's a big disappointment for those who believed capitalism
would bring benefits and progress to the East soon after economic
union occurred on July 1.
   Instead, there has been little investment in East Germany. Many
businesses have failed and there has been a tidal wave of
unemployment. East German industrial production in July was a
whopping 42 percent below July 1989.
   But German economic officials and analysts think things are
fine, that the problems were inevitable.
   ``The conditions for further growth in Germany are
extraordinarily good,'' said Peter Pietsch, an economist with
Commerzbank, one of West Germany's leading banks.
   Pietsch thinks the only problem for the German economy these
days is the Persian Gulf crisis, meaning possibly higher oil
prices.
   The Bundesbank, the West German central bank, said in its
monthly report released Sept. 18 that there had been continued
economic growth in West Germany since July 1.
   Depressing effects of the gulf crisis and slackening demand in
export markets were ``more than compensated for by the swift
expansion of 40,
Mayor Brad Cabana's town council has voted not to collect or pay
the GST, come what may.
   ``It's another example of government not listening to the
people,'' he said. ``It's not a fair tax and it's quite
inflationary.''

<HEAD>Olympia and York Attracts Tenants Using Aggressive Inducements,
Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Olympia and York has attracted tenants
to its Canary Wharf center using such aggressive inducements as
buying a tenant's current building and assuming others' leases,
sources said.
   Questions about how Canary Wharf is faring were raised by the
recent decision of Olympia and York's owners, the Reichmann family
of Toronto, to sell a 20 percent stake in their vast U.S.
properties.
   Canary Wharf, expected to cost 4 billion pounds ($7.5 billion),
is Olympia and York's biggest project ever. It is Europe's largest
office development and boasts Britain's tallest building.
   Outside real estate agents are divided about whether the project
will prove successful. They agreed that it is a risky one because
of its huge size and its untried, hard-to-reach location.
   The 71-acre project is 2.5 miles east of the City of London, or
financial district. It is part of the sprawling Docklands
development on the River Thames.
   It's not being helped by a real estate market depressed by 15
percent interest rates and a slowing economy, the agents say.
   The aggressive marketing of assuming leases reflects a desire by
Olympia and York to create momentum and prove that the first phase
of Canary Wharf will succeed, they say.
   ``It's basically musical chairs. It's all right as long as the
music doesn't stop,'' said John Phillips, a property agent with the
firm Gooch and Wagstaff.
   Olympia and York used such selling techniques in New York in the
past, a Canary Wharf spokeswoman confirmed.
   The developer took over the project three years ago, when an
original consortium including the investment firms Morgan Stanley
and First Boston pulled out because of lack of expertise and
funding for such a large project, she said.
   The Reichmanns' decision to sell interest in some of its
holdings, reported last week, ``has nothing to do with Canary
Wharf,'' said the Canary Wharf spokeswoman who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The developer is pleased with the progress in signing up
clients, she said.
   Olympia and York said last week that a 500 million-pound ($935
million) financing package for Canary Wharf will be completed soon.
The project so far has been funded with developer's own resources
and Canadian bank credit lines.
   Olympia and York views Canary Wharf as a long-term investment,
the spokeswoman said. The company has never failed to complete a
project, she said.
   ``I think it will be successful eventually,'' said Robert
Foster, a partner with the real estate firm Weatherall Green and
Smith.
   But Phillips said: ``I think the whole project is very much at a
stage where it's questionable in viability terms. Even Olympia &amp;
York, with their financial assets, it's beginning to test even
their resources, it's such a big expensive project.''
   Thirteen tenants, including Morgan Stanley, American Express,
and Manufacturers Hanover, have signed up to fill 2.5 million
square feet of the 4.3 million square feet available in the first
phase. The first buildings open in 1991.
   Olympia and York plans to build 10 million square feet of office
space in five phases over as long as 10 years.
   ``They've been succeeding in attracting tenants to a greater
extent than the market expected,'' said Peter Rose, another agent
with Gooch and Wagstaff. ``However, other players in the market
haven't been used to the aggressive tactics that they've used.''
   Although the Canary Wharf spokeswoman said the company doesn't
discuss the details of its tenancy agreements, she confirmed that
the developer has bought the Daily Telegraph's nearby building in
exchange for the newspaper taking space in Canary Wharf.
   Olympia and York has offered to assume prospective clients'
leases, said a source at a company which has negotiated with the
developer. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Another such source said: ``One of the things they have done
which is very smart is to offer to take over people's leases and I
know they have done that in a couple of cases.''
   He said his company was offered low rent, an outfitting
allowance, and a long fixed term without a rent review, which he
called ``usual inducements'' for a new development.
   Foster said Canary Wharf is offering space at ``a very good
rent'' of 30 pounds ($56) a square foot compared with 50 pounds
($94) in the City.

<TEXT>
   Some oil and gas companies are rushing to take
advantage of higher oil prices to increase drilling, but many say
they've learned the hard way that it's better to wait out the
latest Persian Gulf crisis.
   Two companies, Arkla Exploration of Shreveport, La., and
Houston-based Conoco, a DuPont subsidiary, announced this month
they were boosting their domestic exploration budgets.
   But independent producers and other oil and gas companies said
in interviews Wednesday they don't believe prices are going to stay
high enough long enough for them to risk millions of dollars in new
drilling.
   ``A lack of trust in the pricing situation keeps us in place
until we stop staring at each other across the Kuwait border,''
said Julian Martin, executive vice president of the Texas
Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association in Austin.
   Oil prices have been rising since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2,
with light sweet crude nearly double pre-invasion prices at almost
$40 per barrel.
   Conoco announced earlier this month it was boosting its domestic
exploration budget by $10 million, the first major energy company
to respond to the recent price increases with more spending.
Officials said the money would cover the cost of five new wells in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``With the literal dismantling of the exploration infrastructure
in the U.S. during recent years, this country can't expect to see a
significant increase in exploratory activity right away,'' said Max
Pitcher, Conoco's executive vice president for worldwide
exploration.
   ``But while this single effort will not lessen U.S. dependence
on overseas oil right away, it is a step in the right direction,''
he said.
   Arkla, which drills primarily for natural gas, announced last
week it has increased its capital budget for the remainder of 1990
from $55 million to $70 million, a nearly 30 percent jump over what
it originally planned to spend this year.
   ``We are doing something aggressive,'' company spokesman Louis
Resweber said. ``The industry has to step up to the plate and
assist in finding a domestic energy source when we're being
threatened by the Middle East.''
   But Martin and independent producers said it was too risky to
increase drilling with expectations of $40-per-barrel oil and
suddenly be stuck holding $10-per-barrel oil.
   ``Even if a real war breaks out and oil goes up to $60 a barrel,
it would be risky to (increase drilling),'' said Houston oilman
Michel Halbouty. ``Nobody's going to spend a lot of money then
watch the price plummet.''
   ``Most independents were burned in 1985 and 1986,'' TIPRO's
Martin said. ``They fear the same phenomenon will occur again if
they start projecting higher prices for a long time.''
   Martin added, however, that some independents are using the
increase in internal cash flows to rework existing wells and are
increasing production in developed leases. Others, he said, are
saving the money to increase drilling budgets in the next few
months if it becomes clear that oil prices will stay up for a
relatively long time.
   But for now, ``your friendly bank and traditional investors are
unwilling to get into such an uncertain venture,'' Martin said.
   Other natural gas companies, including Mesa Ltd. Partnerships in
Amarillo and Mitchell Energy and Development Corp. in Houston, said
they also were waiting to see how the Persian Gulf crisis shapes up
before increasing drilling.
   ``The more ominous it gets, the more people are tempted to stick
their necks out,'' said Tony Lentini of Mitchell Energy. ``But
they're taking the risk that without a price floor, the Saudis
could flood the market.''
   Lentini also said the company was beginning to turn ``just a
little bit'' toward oil production because of demands for domestic
oil.

<HEAD>Portions of Government's Presentencing Documents Released</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Milken, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from a prosecution memorandum
to U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, outlining the government's
full case against Michael Milken and urging the judge to severely
sentence him.
   The documents were made public Wednesday, by order of the judge,
a day after the defense released its own presentencing memorandum
urging leniency. The documents were edited to conceal identities of
Milken associates, who are labeled as ``John Doe.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>A PATTERN OF FRAUD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken's crimes formed a pattern of calculated fraud, deceit and
corruption of the highest magnitude. In a highly sophisticated and
systematic way, Milken endeavored to enhance his power and enlarge
his wealth by willingly cheating clients, manipulating the
markets,and evading the laws and rules designed to safeguard the
investing public.
   . . . Milken developed and nurtured corrupt relationships with
numerous clients and customers, including Ivan F. Boesky, the
prominent Wall Street arbitrageur, and (John Doe), an institutional
money manager. Together with these criminal associates, Milken
harnessed the vast economic power of Drexel Burnham Lambert's
High-Yield Department and directed it to enhance his power and
increase his wealth. The High-Yield Department became the means
through which Milken rewarded his friends, defeated his rivals, and
committed his crimes.
   . . . Contrary to Milken's persistent efforts to minimize the
nature and scope of his criminal conduct, the six charges to which
Milken pleaded guilty provide but a sampling of the larger pattern
of criminal activity that permeated Milken's operation of the
High-Yield Department.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SEVERE PUNISHMENT REQUIRED</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In our view, three primary reasons mandate that Milken be
severely punished for his crimes. First, Milken's criminal conduct,
as reflected by his guilty plea, was sweeping. It warrants the
imposition of a substantial term of imprisonment.
   Second, notwithstanding his entry of a guilty pea, Milken has
scarcely accepted responsibility for his crimes. He has done little
to mitigate his punishment.
   Finally, Milken's sentence will be used in criminal courts
throughout this country as the model for how our justice system
should treat white-collar criminals. This court's message must be a
clarion call to the community that financial crime cannot be
countenanced and will not be tolerated.
   . . . Put simply, Milken's crimes were crimes of greed,
arrogance and betrayal.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALCULATED AND SYSTEMATIC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Poised atop the Drexel financial colossus, Milken routinely
possessed more power and better information than his clients,
customers and the market.
   . . . On certain occasions, Milken engendered the loyalty of his
customers by abetting their crimes and violations. On other
occasions, Milken unlawfully provided gratuities - often in the
form of valuable investment opportunities available only to those
designated by him - to personally enrich institutional fiduciaries
in order to influence them to direct their institutional business
to Drexel. The net result of these corrupt practices was the
creation of a marketplace rife with conflicts of interest and
manipulative conduct.
   . . . Contrary to his efforts to characterize the crimes he
committed as petty, Milken's crimes were neither technical nor
victimless. They included the fraudulent misappropriation of funds
from unsophisticated investors who entrusted their funds to the
management of others; the deception of market participants who
acted in reliance on the integrity of the marketplace; and contempt
for the legal framework designed to protect such investors and
ensure the integrity of the market.
   . . . Milken's criminal conduct was calculated and systematic,
rather than gratuitous and aberrational, and Milken's criminal
activity was a significant and necessary component of the growth of
his power in the high-yield market.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILKEN UNREPENTANT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken merits scant credit for accepting responsibility and no
credit for cooperation. . . . Milken's decision reflects surrender
not contrition. Further, Milken has not accepted responsibility for
all of his crimes; indeed his self-serving rationalizations to the
Probation Department undercut any serious claim that he has truly
accepted responsiblity for even the crimes to which he has now
pleaded. Finally, in spite of his many post-investigation social
and charitable good works, Milken has not taken - and has indicated
that he will not take - affirmative steps to clean up the industry
he dirtied.
   . . . Milken should be punished as the unreconstructed and
unapologetic man that he is.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HASTENED DREXEL'S DEMISE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Having been responsible for Drexel's rise to prominence, Drexel
might have been Milken's to destroy. But there is no question that
the excesses in Drexel's corporate culture that Milken fathered
hastened the collapse of the company, corrupted many young
professionals and occasioned the loss of thousands of jobs. Were it
not for the lawlessness of Milken's High-Yield Department, there
would not have been grand jury and SEC (Securities and Exchange
Commission) investigations. Even after the investigations,
moreover, the greedy habits of the Milken years led to the payment
of tens of millions of dollars in 1989 bonuses and compensation as
Drexel spiraled towards bankruptcy. Had more money been kept in
Drexel rather than paid out to Milken and other members of the
High-Yeild Department, Drexel undoubtedly would have had a greater
chance to survive.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HIS COMPENSATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The absurdity of Milken's claimed disinterest in wealth is
demonstrated by his direct compensation from Drexel and his
indirect compensation through Drexel. Milken's compensation from
Drexel represented an enormous percentage of Drexel's bottom line.
   (A footnote showed the escalation of his compensation to $550
million in 1986, or 45.8 percent of Drexel's operating profit. His
compensation of $316 million in 1987 was estimated at 81.7 percent
of the company's operating profit, according to the government.)
   . . . As one former employee put it, ``Milken never let go of a
nickel except to get a better grip.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RELATIONSHIP WITH BOESKY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Between 1983 and March 1986, Drexel raised over $800 million for
the Boesky Organization through the sale of high-yield securities.
These financings culminated in March 1986 when Drexel and Milken
raised $660 million for the Boesky Organization.
   This mutually beneficial relationship between Boesky and Milken
evolved over time into a corrupt one in which each engaged in
unlawful conduct to benefit the other . . . The secret Boesky
relationship also allowed Milken to invest in lucrative trading
opportunities which he was legally barred from because of Drexel's
involvement in certain corporate finance transactions.
   . . . In May 1986, Dennis Levine, a prominent merger and
acquisition specialist then employed by Drexel, was arrested for
insider trading. The Levine arrest struck a weighty blow in the
investment community. More particularly, it was an ominous event
for Boesky (because of his own illegal dealings with Levine) and
for Milken (because the arrest signaled a greater law enforcement
vigilance in the investment banking area . . .) Following the
Levine arrest, unlawful trading in the High-Yield Department
slowed.
   More particularly, the Levine arrest affected the course of the
unlawful Milken-Boesky relationship. In July 1986, Boesky visited
Milken for the purpose of discussing a range of business items,
both lawful and unlawful. During the course of a poolside
discussion between Milken and Boesky at Milken's home, the two
discussed the effect of Levine's arrest on their unlawful dealings
. . .
   Boesky and Milken did not meet again until October 1986 . . .
Shortly after the announcement of Boesky's plea and settlement with
the government, (John Doe) asked Milken if he had been ``careful''
in his October 1986 meeting with Boesky. Milken answered that he
thought he had been careful but that he was not entirely sure that
he had been ``careful enough.'' (John Doe)'s fears were justified.
The government tape-recorded Milken's meeting with Boesky in a room
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

<HEAD>ON INSIDER TRADING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   During the period form 1984 through 1986, Drexel was at the
center of Wall Street's takeover boom. Clients came to Drexel, for
the most part, because of Drexel's unmatched ability to raise
capital through the sale of high-yield securities.
   . . . there is substantial evidence that Milken caused Drexel to
buy and sell securities based upon material, non-public information
misappropriated from certain Drexel clients. In one of these
instances, Milken traded on insider information for his own
account.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ON THE DEFENSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken's submission dramatically exposes the gulf between his
crimes and his conviction, on the one hand, and his continuing
agitprop on the other. Milken has been convicted of serious and
sweeping crimes. His good works, however commendable, should not
shield him from incarceration. He should be sentenced to a
substantial term of imprisonment.
   . . . Milken is selling an old and threadbare story. By focusing
the court's attention on the five specific crimes he had admitted -
and by wholly ignoring his conviction on a broad conspiracy charge
- Milken is attempting to minimize his criminal conduct. Were
Milken to address the true range of his crimes, however, even he
would have to acknowledge a different conclusion. Milken's crimes
were serious and extensive.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>LIKE HELL'S ANGEL CASE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken has been convicted of enormously serious crimes:
conspiracy to violate the laws of the United States, securities
fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, tax fraud, and recordkeeping and
reporting violations.
   . . . Although he has limited his allocution to five separate
acts in furtherance of that conspiracy, this court can and should
sentence Milken for all of his crimes.
   . . . In United States v. Kittel . . . Kittel, a member of the
New York Chapter of the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club, was charged
with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute large quantities of
methamphetamine and with 11 substantive counts relating to the
unlawful distribution of methamphetamine. He was convicted on his
plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge and to one of the
distribution charges. In . . . Kittel's sentencing, however, the
government alleged that Kittel had participated in the murder and
dismemberment of another Hells Angels club member and the unlawful
manufacture of an explosive device among other acts of violence.
Judge (Pierre) Leval sentenced Kittel to a 14-year term of
imprisonment stating that the sentence was based not only the
particular offenses to which Kittel had pleaded guilty but on the
government's evidence of Kittel's unadmitted crimes - persistent
drug dealing and acts of violence.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTRAST TO FREEMAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, although the government is asking the court to
sentence Milken on crimes more numerous than he has specifically
admitted, these additional charges are similar to the crimes that
Milken has admitted: manipulating stocks, unlawfully influencing
corporate events through the concealed ownership of securities,
unlawfully providing benefits to clients and client representatives
in order to cultivate their business, and fraudulently
misappropriating funds from clients.
   . . . Indeed, Milken's agreement to pay $200 million in criminal
penalities and $400 million in restitution dramatically belies both
his contention that he committed only the five enumerated crimes
and his argument that even these crimes were aberrational and
technical violations. These fines, penalties, and restitution fix
the scope of Milken's criminal conduct. Milken's agreement to pay
these monies stands out as the most reliable measure of his
criminal conduct.
   For all these reasons, this case is sharply different from
United States v. Freeman . . . In Freeman (where the judge refused
to admit a sentencing report on additional crimes), the defendant
pleaded guilty to one narrow insider trading charge, not to
multiple offenses and a broad conspiracy charge. Unlike Milken,
Robert Freeman did not acknowledge the government's right to put
before the court his ``unadmitted'' offenses. Unlike Milken,
Freeman, in his allocution, did not admit that he committed crimes
additional to the crimes to which he specifically pleaded guilty.
Finally, Freeman did not agree to pay criminal fines and
restitution penalties of $600 million.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PUSH FOR PRISON TIME</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Milken should be sentenced to a substantial period of
incarceration commensurate with his crimes. Those crimes were
pervasive and systemic. They were committed for venal reasons - to
enhance Milken's personal power and increase his wealth. No good
works undertaken by Milken mitigate the imperative of a substantial
prison term. Milken's proposal that he be sentenced to a
probationary term and community service is absurd. Such a sentence
would eviscerate law enforcement's efforts to police and deter
financial crime.
   . . . Milken's crimes have had nationwide impact and his
sentence will become the touchstone for every sentence for
financial crime in the country.
   . . . other sentences demonstrate a consensus among judges that
absent significant actual cooperation, a major securities law
violator such as Milken will receive a substantial term of
incarceration.
   Boesky's three-year term of incarceration provides a useful
point of departure. As an initial, symbolic matter, Milken stands
convicted of six times as many felony charges as Boesky and has
agreed to pay six times Boesky's criminal fine and civil penalty.
While the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic should
determine Milken's sentence, Milken's suggestion that - facing
almost six times Boesky's penalty - he merits a fraction of his
punishment is preposterous.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILKEN'S COOPERATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like Boesky and Levine, Milken committed very serious crimes.
Unike Boesky and Levine, however, Milken has not cooperated. On the
urging of the government, Boesky and Levine each received reduced
sentences because of their extraordinary assistance in the
successful prosecutions of others.
   . . . Boesky's cooperation resulted, directly and indirectly, in
the successful prosecution of numerous prominent securities
industry professionals in addition to Milken. In sharp contrast,
during the four years of Boesky's cooperation, Milken has
vigorously contested the government's charges and allowed the
statute of limitations to preclude prosecution of others based on
any information he could provide.
   . . . (The) sentence of Paul Bilzerian (to four years in prison)
for repeated securities fraud crimes should also inform this
court's exercise of its sentencing discretion. Bilzerian's sentence
was based on multiple criminal acts over an extended period of
time. His violations were similar in type to Milken's admitted
crimes though fewer in number . . . Milken's conduct is, of course,
far more widespread and systemic than Bilzerian's.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RECOMMENDATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken stands before this court having been convicted of
six felonies carrying a maximum sentence of 28 years. He has
committed a range of serious white-collar crimes unmatched in the
1980s. The government respectfully submits that this court should
impose a sentence that reflects the full magnitude of Milken's
unlawful conduct and that unmistakably deters others . . . The
court's sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess great
wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or their
money will insulate them from certain and serious punishment.
   For these reasons, the government respectfully urges that . . .
Michael Milken be sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment.

<HEAD>Congressional Study: Two Market Watchdogs May be Too Many</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two separate regulators for securities and
futures markets may be too many as the links between Wall Street
and Chicago bind the markets together, a congressional study has
concluded.
   A study of financial market technology by the Congress's Office
of Technology Assessment suggested creating one regulatory agency
with responsibility over securities, including futures and options.
   The report found that ``dual regulatory agencies may no longer
be appropriate, for what is now one marketplace.''
   The study, scheduled to be made public today, could heat up the
simmering dispute between the rival regulators - the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Both agencies have engaged in a war of words over which should
regulate stock index futures and their margins.
   Stock index futures are futures contracts that allow investors
to bet on the movement of a whole series of stocks without having
to buy the underlying securities. Margins are the downpayments paid
by investors buying securities on credit. Securities margins are
about 50 percent of the stock's value, while futures margins are
usually just 5 percent of the market value.
   The 220-page report, ``Electronic Bulls and Bears: U.S.
Securities Markets and Inforamtion Technology,'' was an outgrowth
of the 1987 stock market crash.
   The study ``looks at the regulatory structure and says `Hey,
these are now one market and having two agencies that fight each
doesn't make any sense,'' said Vary T. Coates, project director of
the study. The study also is critical of the specialist system of
trading at the New York and American stock exchanges.
   The OTA does not make recommendations to Congress but provides
various policy options, officials stressed. The options included
clearer definitions of jurisdiction by Congress and setting up a
multi-agency panel with binding decision-making authority.
   ``And the one that looks best is to integrate, having one
regulatory agency and this should be reexamined by the Congress,''
said Ms. Coates. Commodities trading would be left in the hands of
a separate regulator.
   The report noted that the biggest stumbling block to a merger is
different congressional committees have jurisdiction over the
agencies ``and may not be willing or able to agree to consolidation
of jurisdiction.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee that oversees the SEC, said the panel would look at
reforming the U.S. regulatory structure which he called
``fragmented and uncoordinated'' and ``out of step with the way
these new electronic bulls and bears run.''
   The report's finding bolstered a bill proposed earlier this year
by Reps. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. and Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, for
merging the SEC and CFTC into a unified ``super regulatory
agency.''
   ``It is gratifying to know that an unbiased and careful analysis
by an arm of Congress has reached the same conclusion that the SEC
has been urging for some time,'' said Mary McCue, an SEC
spokeswoman.
   ``They have their own opinion it's just not what we subscribe
to,'' said CFTC spokesman David Gary. ``We feel the markets are
linked but there is no need for one regulator - in fact we remain
firmly in the camp of functional regulation.''
   The report also said the SEC and CFTC ``often take radically
different positions on issues'' and those differences ``raise
doubts about the reliability of their coordination and cooperation
during market emergencies.''
   Earlier this year, the heads of both agencies trashed each
other's study of the causes of the 1987 stock market crash,
accusing one another of self-serving interpretation of the same
data.
   In January, a draft version of the report drew fire from a
blue-ribbon advisory panel that included representatives from
exchanges in New York and Chicago, for criticizing the specialist
system as ``faltering'' and possibly ``irredeemably obsolete.''
   Under the specialist system, stock can only be traded through
certain designated exchange members charged with maintaining an
orderly market in that security - even if it means buying or
selling the stock because no other takers can be found.
   Critics claim specialists are unable to keep up with the massive
volume that occurs in a market crisis like the 1987 crash. But
supporters say specialists stayed at their posts, taking orders,
when other traders weren't answering their phones during the crash.
   While stock exchanges have sophisticated support systems on
their trading floors, ``they have resisted the use of electronic
systems for after-hours and remote-site trading,'' said the study
which found recently announced plans for after-hours trading
``belated, cautious and tighly limited.''
   The report also said the futures markets have ``resisted
bringing technology into their domestic trading pits.''
   Most futures exchanges still utilize the boisterous system of
shouts and hand signals known as ``open outcry,'' which makes it
difficult to prevent fraud and assure investors they are getting
the best price, said the OTA.

<HEAD>Laura Ashley to Close Seven Factories, Cut 1,500 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, the British clothing
and home furnishings retailer, said Thursday it would close seven
factories and cut 1,500 jobs, or nearly a fifth of its work force.
   The company said the moves were part of an ongoing cost-cutting
program it began last year. It attributed the closures and cuts to
a need to counter the effects of a strong British pound and high
inflation.
   The company said it would be left with 6,650 workers and two
manufacturing facilities.
   It said 1,000 of the job cuts would result from the factory
closures, while the other 500 cuts would come from its worldwide
retail operations.
   ``If Laura Ashley is to survive in today's highly competitive
environment, it is no longer viable to source the current level of
garments worldwide from our U.K. factories when products of similar
quality can be obtained at a significantly lower cost from other
supplies in other countries,'' Chairman Bernard Ashley said.
   The company said it would maintain enough in-house
garment-making capacity to respond to quick changes in market
needs. It said it would continue to print its own fabrics and
wallpaper and operate its own curtain factory.
   The company lost 9.8 million pounds, or $18.3 million, in the
year ended Jan. 27 in contrast to a net profit of 8.4 million
pounds, or $15.7 million, in the previous year.

<HEAD>Boeing Study Aims For Fewer Crashes Despite More Crowded Skies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flying is getting safer, but more planes in
the sky will mean more crashes unless the airline industry takes
action, a Boeing Co. study says.
   The study also indicates a few simple changes in operations plus
some relatively inexpensive equipment might help reduce serious
accidents, Earl Weener, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group's chief
engineer for safety, said Wednesday.
   The airplane manufacturer has kept statistics on all free world
commercial jets for the past 30 years. The company predicts the
worldwide accident rate for jetliners should decline to about 1 per
million flights in 2005, compared with an average of about 1.5 per
million in the past 10 years.
   But the number of jets is expected to double in the next 15
years to about 13,000. Weener said actual aircraft losses can be
expected to grow to 20 per year by 2005, up from a yearly average
of 15 during the past decade.
   That means a major air crash every 2{ weeks or so, something
that won't sit well with the traveling public no matter how low the
accident rate is, Weener said.
   ``If the general public understood rates, there wouldn't be a
state lottery in existence,'' Weener said.
   Boeing, which has 60 percent of the world's commercial jet
market, has been pushing its study among air carriers, industry
groups and government regulators for the past year, Weener said.
   Weener, who briefed a group of reporters on the study Wednesday,
plans to make presentations to carriers and regulators next month
in Europe and Southeast Asia.
   So far, Boeing has seen ``a great deal of understanding and
interest'' on the part of airlines, but it's been difficult to
determine what the results have been, Weener said. This year there
have been nine ``hull loss'' accidents - wrecks in which the
aircraft was destroyed or too badly damaged to fix - which
statistically would make 1990 one of the better years, he said.
   Dave Duff, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Seattle, said the agency is looking at the study but hasn't made
any decisions on it.
   The study says investigating agencies found that of the 121
hull-loss accidents in the past 10 years, the flight crew was the
primary cause in 88 accidents or 72.5 percent.
   Weener said Boeing isn't holding pilots entirely to blame. In
most cases, he said, the flight crew was only ``the last party who
could have prevented the accident'' in a chain of events. Boeing
has used the data to help design aircraft that are more ``mistake
tolerant,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association was not
immediately available for comment Wednesday but ALPA officials
previously have said they support Boeing's study.
   The study focuses on what might be done to avoid crew error,
especially on takeoffs and landings, where nearly 70 percent of
hull-loss accidents occur.
   Among its recommendations:
   -Install ``ground proximity warning systems'' in all jets and
make sure crews pay attention to them. The systems, which warn
pilots to pull up when the ground gets too near, have been required
in U.S. jetliners since 1975 but not in all foreign commercial
jets.
   -Install instrument landing systems for all runways and
encourage pilots to use them, even in good weather. Virtually all
U.S. airports have instrument landing systems, but many have them
on only one runway. Many foreign airports lack them altogether,
Weener said.
   -Make better use of flight data recorders, the ``black boxes''
that monitor flights. Currently, 12 carriers, none of them in this
country, use the monitors to review flights and let pilots learn
what they might have done better, Weener said. Airline managers
have to see the monitors as teaching tools, he added.

   USAir Group Inc., the parent of USAir, has
suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and postponed
buying new aircraft.
   The company had been paying an annual dividend of 12 cents a
sharte.
   Analysts said the carrier is facing losses as high as $350
million for the year. It had an operating loss of $101 million in
the first half of this year in contrast to an operating proifit of
$258 million in the same period in 1989.
   Raymond E. Neidl, an analyst for Dillon Read &amp; Co., said the
dividend suspension was a prudent way to conserve cash.
   USAir Chairman and President Edwin I. Colodny said Wednesday the
board voted to suspend the stock dividend ``in light of the
company's recent financial performance and the poor outlook for the
nation's economy and its effect on air travel.''
   The airline industry has also been battered in recent weeks by
sharply rising fuel costs in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The dividend suspension will save about $3.5 million annually,
the company said.
   The airline, however, remains liable for $33 million in annual
dividend payments to Berkshire Hathaway Inc., headed by investor
Warren Buffett, whose company put $358 million into USAir preferred
stock last year.
   The company also delayed delivery of 16 new Boeing aircraft for
a year.
   Earlier this year, USAir put off taking delivery of 12 Boeing
737 jets from 1991 and 1992 to 1995.

<HEAD>Taiwan Lifts Restrictions on Hiring Foreign Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Taiwan government lifted restrictions
Thursday on the employment of foreign workers in government
construction projects.
   Under the new rule approved by the Cabinet, contractors can
apply for the importation of foreign workers for major government
and special public projects.
   Currently, they can only import up to one-third of the work
force needed for such construction projects.
   Officials also said that all foreign workers should be protected
by Taiwan's labor laws, which stipulate that every worker receive a
minimum monthly wage of 9,750 Taiwan dollars, or about $357 (U.S.),
and be covered by health insurance.
   ``The new move would help boost our economic development,'' said
Chen Chung-sheng, director general of Occupational Training Bureau,
an agency under the Labor Council.
   In 1985, the government announced 14 projects to be completed in
the early 1990s, including highway expansions, a major rail line
and rapid transit system for Taipei. Chen said many of them have
lagged behind schedule mainly because of the shortage of
construction workers.
   ``Our workers don't like the non-skilled jobs that offer lower
wages,'' he explained.
   Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien urged the
government to employ more workers from the Philippines, Indonesia
and Thailand, saying the three nations have showed strong interest
in meeting Taiwan's labor regulations.
   Officials said at least 20,000 foreigners, mostly from southeast
Asia, are working illegally in Taiwan factories and construction
sites because of a labor shortage.

   In a new indication of the escalating economic
fallout from the Persian Gulf turmoil, the head of the World Bank
said today that he may be forced to call upon rich nations to boost
their support for the international lending institution by early
next year.
   World Bank President Barber Conable said that if oil prices
remain at current high levels over the next three months, his
institution would not have enough in existing resources to cushion
the shock on the world economy.
   Conable's comments represented a change from his position just a
few days ago. At that time, he and officials of the bank's sister
lending organization, the International Monetary Fund, insisted
that they could handle the economic impact of the Persian Gulf
crisis with available resources without tapping rich countries for
additional funds.
   However, as delegates from 154 member countries of the two
institutions were holding their annual meeting this week, the price
of oil jumped at one point to close to $40.
   Conable told reporters today that if oil prices stayed at high
levels into 1991, he believed it would be necessary to ask for
voluntary contributions from major industrial countries and oil
producing nations. That money would be used to make no-interest
loans to countries especially hard hit by the rise in oil prices
and other economic fallouts from the Persian Gulf turmoil.
   ``If the price of oil stays up and there continues to be turmoil
and uncertainty and an impact on the global economy, clearly it
will have a major impact on significant parts of the developing
world,'' Conable said.
   Other officials of the World Bank suggested that the proposed
new lending facility would be available to work with the Gulf
Crisis Financial Coordination Group, the steering committee of
donor countries unveiled by President Bush in his speech to the
IMF-World Bank opening session on Tuesday.
   Officials said that donations raised by the crisis group, which
is headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholast Brady, might be funneled
to this new lending facility for distribution to needy countries.
However, they stressed that discussions on this matter remained at
a preliminary stage.
   Both the IMF and World Bank had signaled earlier this week that
they were ready to provide significant economic support to hardhit
countries, endorsing a request made by the Bush administration. But
that approval involved the use of existing programs.
   The crisis group, with officials representing more than 20
nations, held an organizational session Wednesday at the U.S.
Treasury.
   The United States had hoped to amass commitments this week for
between $13 billion and $15 billion in aid to Turkey, Jordan and
Egypt. Those ``frontline'' nations have been hard hit by the U.N.
economic sanctions placed on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   But some European nations objected that the figure was too high
and that a more realistic amount was $9 billion, with $6 billion of
that support coming from oil-rich Mideast nations and $3 billion
from the rest of the world.
   Following two hours of closed-door discussions at the U.S.
Treasury, officials reported no resolution of the funding question.
   Also left unresolved were objections voiced to including Jordan
in the assistance package. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have complained
that Jordan is showing reluctance to support the U.N. trade embargo
and therefore should not get aid.
   And some nations raised the question of including other
especially hard-hit nations in the frontline category in addition
to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt.
   Proponents of a longer list pointed to a new World Bank study
that identified Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri
Lanka and Sudan as seriously hurt by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   U.S. officials said they would not oppose expanding the list of
most needy nations as long as the list did not grow too long.
   One senior Treasury official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said many of the unresolved matters should be cleared up
in discussions by lower-level working groups before the full crisis
coordinating panel meets again on Oct. 12.
   The nations participating with the United States in Wednesday's
meeting included Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada,
Italy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and
South Korea.
   In addition, representatives of Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland were added at the last minute after West Germany
and others argued that the list of potential donor countries needed
to be expanded.
   The U.S. official said, however, that not all of the
participating countries had made a commitment to provide financial
assistance.
   Representatives from the 12-nation European Community and the
Gulf Cooperation Council of Persian Gulf countries also attended
the meeting.

   The stock market fell into negative territory
today as an early surge fizzled.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spurted more than
20 points higher at the opening, was off 9.40 at 2,450.25 in the
first hour and a half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gaining
issues by about 7 to 5 with 671 declining, 505 advancing and 546
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 55.90 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market got an initial jolt of support from lower energy
prices and higher bond prices, triggered by President Bush's
announcement Wednesday that he will sell 5 million barrels from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The near-term crude contract opened nearly $1 a barrel lower.
But as investors digested the news, their enthusiasm waned. In
addition to the fact that no other country has followed Bush's lead
in tapping their own oil reserves, the amount he plans to release
is ``very small, very minor compared to what U.S. oil needs are,''
said Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA.
   Market watchers were immediately skeptical that the morning's
bounce could be maintained. Given the decline in stock prices, no
one was surprised by the advance, but a bearish sentiment hung over
the market.
   The financial sector continued to take a severe beating and
served as a drag on the rest of the market. Several big bank issues
hit 52-week lows in the previous session and tumbled even further
today. Among them, Citicorp was down 1&rsqb; at 13&lsqb;; NCNB plunged 3} to

Carbide, which announced a restructuring plan that includes a stock
buyback, was up 1 at 15\; Philip Morris was up &lsqb; at 44}, and IBM
was unchanged at 105&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.92 to 166.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 309.36, off 0.70.

   Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group has
bought a 40 percent stake in Budapest's evening daily Esti Hirlap,
the British media baron's second such investment in Hungary, the
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Mirror Group bought a 40 percent stake in the paper for
$750,000, Esti Hirlap said. The Hungarian News Publishing Co. also
holds 40 percent while the paper's editorial board controls the
remaining 20 percent.
   Maxwell's purchase follows five months of negotiations since an
initial letter of intent was signed.
   Esti Hirlap, formerly controlled by the Budapest Communist
Party, has a circulation of about 80,000.
   Previously, Maxwell bought a 49 percent stake in Magyar Hirlap,
the former government daily.
   On Wednesday, Maxwell announced that he was in a partnership
with the investment bank Merrill Lynch that would set up a $250
million Central and East European investment fund in the Hungarian
capital, the national news agency MTI reported.
   The fund will finance projects in energy, tourism,
consumer-goods manufacture and telecommunications, MTI said.

   Oil prices advanced today, moving briefly past
the $40-a-barrel mark for the first time, as another round of
antagonistic statements from Iraq overshadowed President Bush's
decision to sell a small part of the government's oil reserves.
   The November contract for light, sweet crude was up 68 cents at
$39.35 a 42-gallon barrel at midday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Earlier in the session, the contract rose to $40.10, the first
time the price of oil has traded above $40.
   Analysts said Bush's decision to release 5 million of America's
590 million barrels of strategic reserves was intended to calm the
market, where prices have doubled since early August.
   ``He's recognized correctly that the battle is taking place in
the psychological arena,'' said Peter Beutel, an energy market
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.
   Psychology was at work in the market again today.
   An Iraqi threat to execute U.S. and other diplomats unless they
hand over Westerners they're sheltering revived trader fears that a
possible military conflict could disrupt oil supplies from Saudi
Arabia.
   The threat punctured the brief stability Bush's announcement had
given the market. The November contract for crude fell to $37.67 in
early trading before reversing course.
   ``We have not lost any Saudi production, but the threat of
losing it is making people constantly nervous,'' Beutel said.
   In earlier London trading, North Sea Brent Blend for November
delivery was trading at $36.75 a barrel, down $1.20 from
Wednesday's close of $37.95 a barrel.
   Bush said the country has ``sufficient oil to meet current
needs,'' and added that ``there is no justification for the
intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures.''
   One London broker said the announcement ``has reminded people
that there are a number of large strategic reserves in the West
which could be released if this is deemed to be necessary, so it
may calm matters slightly.''
   Paul Spedding, an oil analyst at the London investment firm
Kleinwort Benson Ltd., said, ``People were beginning to despair
that the U.S. government would never use its stocks.
   ``It has now been demonstrated there is a restraint mechanism on
oil prices. It is a small but symbolic move,'' he said.

   The government gave its final approval
Thursday to a deal between Swedish car maker Volvo and Renault, the
French state-owned automotive concern.
   Volvo and Renault will swap 45 percent of shares in their truck
and bus operations and exchange 25 percent of stock in their car
divisions, a press release from Volvo said.
   Renault's acquisition would make it the largest ever foreign
investment in Sweden, Volvo said.
   The deal makes the two auto makers ``the world's largest
industrial group for heavy trucks, Europe's largest bus
manufacturer and one of the world's largest car makers,'' Volvo
said.
   It will also reinforce Volvo's presence in the European
Community, where Sweden is not a member.
   Volvo received approval to use 3 billion kronor, or $5.2
million, of its investment reserves through 1993 in Sweden.
   The deal must win the approval of the French government before
it can be concluded formally in January 1991.

   The U.S. dollar fell slightly against other major
currencies in European trading Thursday.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow
range in the absence of any market-moving news. But they said that
general perceptions of fundamental weakness in the U.S. economy
continues to depress the dollar.
   Some profit-taking from previous gains and a drop on Wall Street
also helped keep the dollar on the defensive, dealers said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8690 from $1.8635 late
Wednesday. By midday in New York, the dollar traded at $1.8725.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.5685 German marks, down from 1.5715; 1.3055 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3110; 5.2555 French francs, down from 5.2615;
1.7695 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7725; 1,175.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,176.00; and 1.1573 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1535.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York: 1.5660 German marks,
1.2980 Swiss francs, 1,170.00 Italian lire, and 1.15475 Canadian
dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed up 137.50 Japanese yen from 137.40
yen Wednesday. It traded at 138.45 yen in London, and 138.04 by
midday in New York.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $405.75 a troy ounce
from $404.85 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $406 an
ounce, up from $402.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.12 to close at $403.29 an

   The privatization decree ``has already been drawn up'' and will

   The sale of loss-ridden public companies has been a centerpiece

   Many other state companies are in the process of being sold,

chemical plants and the oil company that is the country's biggest
in terms of annual sales.

<HEAD>Keating Appeals State Supreme Court for Lower Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jailed savings and loan executive Charles H.
Keating Jr. has appealed to the state Supreme Court for a reduction
in his $5 million bail.
   In his Wednesday appeal, the former chairman of American
Continental Corp. said the high bail constitutes cruel and unusual
punishment.
   He also has claimed he cannot legally defend himself properly
from a jail cell.
   Keating filed the petition after the state's 2nd District Court
of Appeal on Tuesday rejected his request to reduce the bail
Superior Judge Gary Klausner set for him Sept. 18.
   Klausner last week refused to lower the bail, saying the charges
against Keating were so serious he might flee.
   Keating has been charged along with three co-defendants in the
selling of more than $200 million in risky junk bonds to more than
17,000 investors through branches of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   The bonds became nearly worthless in April 1989 when Lincoln was
seized by federal regulators and American Continental, its parent
company, filed for bankruptcy.
   The co-defendants, officers of American Continental or Lincoln,
originally were held on $1 million bail each. Their individual
bails were later reduced to $100,000 or $200,000 and they were
freed after posting bail.
   Keating's latest appeal claims the case against him should
receive the same consideration as those of his co-defendants.
   Keating has declared he is bankrupt and cannot pay the bail. His
attorneys say he is about $5 million in debt, and even if his
children offer their houses as collateral, they could only pay
about $500,000 of the bail.
   According to court testimony last week, Keating was worth nearly
$40 million three years ago.
   Keating's attorneys have said he is not a flight risk, arguing
he has not fled any of more than two dozen civil cases filed
against him since his firm went to bankruptcy court.

4, 1988. Volume on the first section was an estimated 430 million
shares.
   On Wednesday, the index shed 1,108.70 points, or 4.75 percent,
the ninth largest single-day decline as measured by points in the
index's history.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, which lists all shares on the
exchange's First Section, has been an even better guide to recent
market activity, said Yoshio Miyauchi, an equities trader for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia.
   The TOPIX index weighs shares according to the company size and
other factors, so a fall in the stock value of a large company has
a greater impact than an equal decline in the value of a smaller
company.
   Today, the TOPIX index fell 31.18 points, or 1.89 percent, to
1,620.26, the lowest level since Jan. 1, 1988.
   The Nikkei has lost a total of 44.05 percent since the beginning
of the year, the second largest cumulative percentage loss after
World War II. In 1965, the index fell 44.2 percent.
   News that the Baghdad had notified the United States embassy
that it would apply the death penalty to anyone hiding foreigners
in diplomatic embassies sent the stock market plummeting in the
morning, analysts said.
   The market recovered during the day but ended down.
   ``I am afraid to say that Japanese investors just lost all
confidence,'' especially after the Nikkei index fell below the
psychological barrier of 23,000 points on Wednesday, said Amy Yip,
manager of sales at Baring Securities.
   Individual investors had been propping up the market for a
couple of months after institutional investors retreated to the
sidelines. But higher interest rates and inflation fears linked to
higher oil prices are starting to extract a toll, Yip said.
   North Sea Brent crude oil prices came down sharply today on word
that the United States would be selling 5 million barrels of oil
from its strategic petroleum reserves to stem rising prices.
   At about 3 a.m. EDT in Tokyo, Brent crude for November delivery
was notionally valued at about $36.60 a barrel, down from $38.10 a
barrel in New York late Wednesday.

   Stock prices plunged today as an early surge
fizzled along with a hike in oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spurted more than
20 points higher at the opening, was off 39.35 at 2,420.30 at
midafternoon. Losers outnumbered gaining issues by nearly 4 to 1
with 1,182 declining, 332 advancing and 427 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 132.85 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   The market got an initial jolt of support from lower energy
prices and higher bond prices, triggered by President Bush's
announcement Wednesday that he will sell 5 million barrels from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The near-term crude contract opened nearly $1 a barrel lower.
But investors quickly realized that not only had no other country
mimicked, the amount of oil the president plans to release is
``very small, very minor compared to what U.S. oil needs are,''
said Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA.
   Crude prices spiked up above $40 to a new record before
receding, and the stock market's decline accelerated. At one point
the Dow was off 50 points, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's
``uptick rule,'' which restricts computer-driven program sell
orders.
   The financial sector continued to take a severe beating and
served as a drag on the rest of the market. Several big bank issues
hit 52-week lows in the previous session and tumbled even further
today. Among them, Citicorp was down 1\ at 13\; NCNB plunged 3| to
19|; J.P. Morgan was down \ at 30{; Chase Manhattan was down | at
10{ and Continental Bank was off { at 7{.

Carbide, which announced a restructuring plan that includes a stock
buyback, was up ~ at 15&lsqb;; Philip Morris was down { at 44&lsqb;, and IBM
was down 1{ at 103~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.58 to 164.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 305.77, off 4.29.

   Share prices closed higher on London's stock

<HEAD>Italian Auto Giant Reports Lower Pre-tax Profit In First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The automotive giant Fiat said Thursday its
profit before taxes fell 12.6 percent in the first half of 1990
despite an 11.8 percent rise in revenue.
   The Turin-based company, which is owned by the Agnelli family,
blamed the earnings drop on increased competition in its key
markets and the sharp losses of its Brazilian subdiaries.
   In a statement, Fiat called the first-half results
``satisfactory'' but said the outlook for the second half was cause
for concern because some of its sectors are likely to suffer from
the impact of the Gulf crisis on the world economy.
   Fiat said that the January-June period this year its pre-tax
profit dropped to 2.45 trillion lire, or $2.22 billion, from 2.80
trillion lire, or $2.54 billion, a year earlier.
   In the same period consolidated revenue rose to 30.3 trillion
lire, or $27.5 billion, from 27.1 trillion lire, or $24.6 billion.
   Fiat's Brazilian units lost more than 300 billion lire, or $272
million, in the first half, in part because the Brazilian
government's tough economic measures penalized exports.

<HEAD>Italy Passes Its First Antitrust Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's first anti-monopoly law cleared its last
hurdle Thursday.
   The Industry Commission of the Italian Senate voted unanimously
to approve the legislation, which will bring Italy into line with
regulations laid down recently by the European Community.
   ``This decision has enabled us to provide an essential
instrument to regulate the domestic market in harmony with the
(European) Community orms,'' said Senator Robert Cassola,
president of the Senate's Industry Commission.
   The Senate approved the law in a brief morning session, adding
no changes to the version already approved by the Chamber of
Deputies.
   Italy was among the last of its European counterparts to pass an
antitrust law.
   The measure is designed to ensure free competition principles
and prohibit the formation of monopolies or agreements among firms
that would create dominant market positions.
   The legislation isn't likely to have any immediate impact on the
current concentration of Italian industry, however.
   ``Other than the state monopolies that have formed over the
years, there are very few monopolies in Italy,'' said Paolo Filippo
Lardera, Italy analyst with UBS Phillips and Drew in London.
   ``This measure must be viewed in a wider European context,
because Italian industry is already disadvantaged with respect to
the rest of Europe in terms of dimension and the fragmentation of
many sectors,'' Lardera said.
   Under the law, an anti-monopoly commission will be established
to enforce the new norms. The commission will have authority to
review cases on its own or on request by the Industry Ministry.
   The most controversial portion of the new law regulates the
relationship between banks and industry, limiting the degree of
control industrial companies can acquire over the financial sector.
   As a result of the new law, an industrialist won't be allowed to
acquire direct or indirect shareholdings of more than 15 percent in
a bank.
   Furthermore, a company must inform the Bank of Italy if it takes
up more than 5 percent of a bank. Companies will be permitted to
participate in shareholder syndicates of banks provided they don't
gain a majority position in the syndicate.
   These provisions evolved in an effort, championed by the Bank of
Italy, to safeguard the financial sector from manipulation by
industrial companies.
   Although Italy's 1936 Banking Law prevents commercial banks from
taking permanent shareholdings in industry, until now there was no
legislation to prevent companies from acquiring stakes in banks.

<TEXT>
   Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; C. Spa, the office
equipment manufacturer, reported Thursday a 41 percent drop in its
profit before taxes for the first half of 1990.
   Olivetti's chairman and controlling shareholder, Carlo De
Benedetti, blamed the earnings drop on tough market conditions, a
continuing squeeze in profit margins and an unfavorable exchange
rate for the lira.
   The company posted consolidated pre-tax profit of 60.9 billion
lire, or $52.1 million, in the first six months of the year, down
from 102.6 billion lire, or $87.7 million, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 5.8 percent to 4.167 trillion lire, or $3.56
billion.
   Stagnation in the U.S. computer market, a continued slowdown of
the European market and growing competition by U.S. and Japanese
computer manufacturers all increased pressure on margins, the
company said.
   The lira's strength against the dollar and European currencies
hurt Olivetti because the bulk of its production costs are in lire
while 60 percent of its sales are in foreign currency, De Benedetti
said.
   In fact, adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations, revenue rose
8.8 percent in the first semester, he said.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. is giving $7 million to the
Alaska Visitors Association for a national television advertising
campaign to bring back visitors who may have been scared away by
last year's oil spill.
   Starting Thursday, half of the nation's television viewers will
be exposed to the three 30-second commercials, said Karen Cowart,
the association's director.
   The commercials dovetail with Exxon's message about the effects
of the spill on Prince William Sound. ``See its pristine shoreline,
nearly restored after last year's spill,'' an announcer says.
   Exxon's contribution to the ads ``is consistent with our
performance here to help industries in this state that may have
suffered some damage as a result of the spill,'' said Karsten
Rodvik, a company spokesman.
   Exxon last summer contributed to a print and broadcast ad
campaign that was responsible for convincing 11,000 people to visit
Alaska last summer despite an initial reticence, Cowart said.
   She said this summer's tourist season has been strong, although
some fishing lodges report lingering effects from anglers'
attitudes about the spill.
   Studies have suggested the spill may have cost Alaska nearly $20
million in lost tourist spending last year.

   General Motors Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. may
participate in a truck manufacturing project in Czechoslovakia, a
GM spokesman said Thursday.
   ``We are having discussions in Czechoslovakia about possible
activity with commercial vehicles,'' GM spokesman Jack Harned said.
``Participation does not mean it will necessarily be a joint
venture company. Specifics of the project have not been
determined.''
   GM owns 40.2 percent of Isuzu, Japan's second largest truck
maker. GM has been working with the manufacturer Bratislava in
Czechoslovakia, he said, and Isuzu would likely be involved in some
capacity if an agreement is reached.
   ``It could be their product or their technology. Some form of
participation by Isuzu could be likely,'' he said.
   GM currently has agreements with subsidiaries in Czechoslovakia
to manufacture transmissions.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper,
said the commercial vehicle plan was recently disclosed by John
Smith, vice chairman of GM. Smith was quoted as saying Isuzu might
cooperate in producing commercial vehicles in Hungary. Harned,
however, denied the report and said GM had no plans to make
commercial vehicles in Hungary.
   Earlier this year, GM and RABA, Hungary's state-owned
manufacturer of trucks, diesel engines and axles, announced a plan
to invest in a plant under construction in the city of
Szentgotthard.
   The deal made GM the first U.S. automaker to invest in Eastern
Europe, which has experienced political and economic liberalization
in recent months.
   Chrysler Corp. sells cars in Europe but doesn't run independent
manufacturing plants there. Ford Motor Co. spokesmen have said the
No. 2 automaker was closely watching the Eastern Europe market.

<HEAD>American Continental Liquidation Plan on Way to Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A liquidation plan for American Continental
Corp., formerly led by Charles H. Keating Jr., is headed toward a
creditors' committee after a nod from a federal judge.
   The plan's provisions include a $21 million payment by the
government to creditors, disposal of American Continental's assets
and agreement by the government to join lawsuits filed by creditors
against Keating and others.
   During a hearing Wednesday, District Judge Richard Bilby
indicated he intends to approve the plan with some modifications,
law clerk Linda McNulty said Thursday.
   The plan now goes to a creditors' committee, which will revise
it before returning it to the judge. Bilby could either approve it
or order more changes as early as next week, Ms. McNulty said.
   The plan would then be sent to all of the approximately 25,000
creditors. Both a majority of individual creditors and those
holding the majority of the $365 million debt must approve the
plan.
   Phoenix-based American Continental filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in April 1989. The next day its primary
subsidiary, Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
was seized by federal regulators.
   In a related ruling Wednesday, Bilby approved the settlement of
two lawsuits filed by American Continental investors. Both were
against law firms accused of helping Keating deceive investors and
government regulatory agencies as to the stability of his financial
empire.
   The settlements, for a total $24.3 million, will return 10
percent of what investors are believed to have lost when American
Continental collapsed.
   Keating and three other former executives of American
Continental or Lincoln were indicted in Los Angeles last week on
state charges of securities fraud stemming from the sales of junk
bonds. Keating remained jailed Thursday in lieu of $5 million bond
pending an Oct. 5 arraignment, although he has appealed to the
state Supreme Court to reduce his bail.
   The liquidation plan was agreed to by American Continental, its
creditors and the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that
took over Lincoln after it was seized by regulators.
   Under the plan, American Continental's remaining assets, last
valued at $16 million, would be disposed of over a three-year
period.
   The RTC would provide creditors with $21 million immediately
upon approval of the plan, providing creditors with compensation
ranging up to 21 cents on the dollar.
   In return, the creditors would drop all claims against Lincoln
Savings' 11 subsidiaries.
   The plan also calls for the RTC to become a party in a series of
lawsuits against more than 50 defendants, including Keating, other
former American Continental and Lincoln officials and numerous
business associates.

One-Fifth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ashley, hailed as a great British retailing
success story until falling on hard times, said Thursday it will
sell or close most of its factories and cut its work force by
one-fifth in an effort to survive.
   The retailer of English country-style women's clothing and home
furnishings operates nearly 500 stores worldwide, 185 of them in
the United States.
   Its shops are recognizable by their dark green fronts and
blackberry sprig motif and are best-known for their flower-print,
Victorian-style dresses.
   In a drastic switch, the company said it decided to largely
abandon manufacturing its own apparel because it can be bought much
more cheaply from outside suppliers.
   The slimdown is part of a year-old cost-cutting program, it
said. It blamed the strong British pound and high inflation for its
woes.
   Seven of its nine factories in Britain and Ireland will be
closed or sold, and 1,500 of its 8,150 jobs will go, the company
said.
   Stock of Laura Ashley Holdings has suffered along with the
company's fortunes. It traded at the equivalent of $1.12 a share on
London's Stock Exchange Thursday, unchanged from Wednesday, and
less than half the price at which investors snapped up the shares
when the company went public in 1985.
   Money-losing Laura Ashley is not the only troubled British
retailer. Many operators have suffered from 15 percent interest
rates, engineered by the government to curb inflation by slowing
consumer spending. The annual inflation rate is running at 10.6
percent.
   Another of Britain's one-time retailing stars, the sock chain
Sock Shop International PLC, fell into the hands of administrators
earlier this year.
   Laura Ashley said it will retain enough in-house manufacturing
to respond to changes in market needs. It said it would continue
printing its own fabrics and wallpaper, and making its own
curtains.
   Chairman Bernard Ashley issued a statement saying, ``If Laura
Ashley is to survive in today's highly competitive environment,''
it could no longer supply its stores worldwide with garments made
in its British factories.
   For years, the company had pursued a strategy of being a fully
integrated retailer by making what it sold.
   In late August, Laura Ashley moved to raise cash and inspire
confidence by selling a 15 percent stake to the Japanese retailer
Jusco Co. for $56 million. The Ashley family, with the Ashley
Foundation, retained a 59 percent stake.
   Joan d'Olier, a retail analyst with the London investment firm
County Natwest Woodmac, said about the latest moves: ``It's good
they have bitten the bullet. Long-term, they had to bring down the
cost base in order to have a viable continuing business.''
   Brian Corris, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. said:
``I think it's got a long way to go but this (abandoning
manufacturing) is obviously a step in the right direction.''
   Mrs. d'Olier blamed the company's difficulties on mismanagement.
``It hasn't been a sale problem. It's been a cost problem,'' she
said.
   The Laura Ashley look still has appeal, Mrs. d'Olier said. ``The
biggest asset the company has is the Laura Ashley brand. There is
still a lot of goodwill attached to that.''
   The company, which had been expected to report its half-year
results this week, said they would be released in mid-October.
   It lost the equivalent of about $18.3 million in the year ended
Jan. 27, compared with a profit of $15.7 million the previous year.
Sales grew to $555 million from $472 million.
   The late Laura Ashley and her husband Bernard began the clothier
as a small cottage industry in a London apartment 37 years ago.
They printed fabrics on their kitchen table.
   The couple expanded into garments, accessories, wallpaper and
soft furnishings. They opened their first store in 1968.
   The Welsh-born Mrs. Ashley died of head injuries in September
1985 at the age of 60 after falling down steep stairs at her
daughter's West England home.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bondholders in Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. on
Thursday approved the sale of the company's brewery operations to
Bell Resources Ltd.
   Bell, which is 58 percent owned by Bond Corp., plans to sell a
50 percent stake in the breweries to Lion Nathan Ltd., a New
Zealand-based brewer, and operate them as a joint venture.
   The European bondholder approval came a day after Alan Bond
resigned as chairman and a director of Bond Corp. to pave a way for
the financially troubled concern's restructuring.
   The brewery sale still could collapse if a group of investors
who hold certain debentures issued by Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. in
the United States fails to agree to sell the securities back to the
company at a discount.
   That buy-back offer has been extended until Friday.

   Wheat and soybean futures were mostly higher,
while corn was mostly lower at the close of an unremarkable day of
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures prices extended Wednesday's gains after the
Agriculture Department confirmed reports that it has offered to
sell subsidized flour to the Soviet Union, Morocco and other West
African countries.
   None of the countries have made a firm commitment to buy.
   ``There is the expectation that at some point the Soviets will
come in and be a buyer,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``Right now, everybody's
waiting for that. It takes some of the pressure off the market.''
   Soybean futures prices followed wheat's lead after the USDA also
reported the Soviet Union might be interested in buying soybean
meal, Spilka said. Speculation that the deal may be soon came after
several major commercial firms bought good quantities of soybean
meal contracts, he said.
   Corn futures prices were mostly lower in thin, quiet trading
after morning weather reports predicted near-ideal harvest weather
over the next week. Such good weather hold prices lower because
there is no fear of shortages.
   The USDA grain stocks report also was a factor in the thin
trading, some analysts said. But Spilka said after the report's
release at the close of trading that it should have little effect
on Friday's market.
   ``In the past, the numbers have been all ver the map,'' he
said. ``I wouldn't place great emphasis on the report having much
influence.''
   Soybeans, which analysts estimated would average 249 million
bushels, came in at 239 million; corn, estimated at 1.34 billion

   Assets of the nation's 524 money market mutual
funds edged up $361.6 million in the latest week to a record total
of $409.12 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$1.72 billion increase in the funds' assets the previous week that
had lifted the funds' assets to the previous all-time high of
$408.76 billion, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 256 general purpose funds rose $681.3 million to $145.53
billion and assets of 163 institutional funds rose $185.8 million
to $98.48 billion while assets of 105 broker-dealer funds fell
$505.5 million to $165.10 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds edged
up in the week ended Tuesday to 7.47 percent from 7.46 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield held steady at 7.47 percent, unchanged
from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
also unchanged at 46 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nati n's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts held
steady at 6.05 percent as of Wednesday, the same as a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, were also steady at 5.02 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.69
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.83 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
7.94 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.92 percent; and 8.06 percent
on 5-year CDs, up from 8.05 percent.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today put off the Monday
sentencing of Michael Milken and ordered an extraordinary hearing
to consider the unadmitted crimes alleged by the government against
the junk-bond financier.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said she would hold a hearing
in early October for approximately two weeks and give each side 20
hours to present arguments before pronouncing sentence.
   Milken pleaded guilty in April to six felonies and faces a
maximum 28 years in prison for his role in Wall Street's worst
financial scandal.
   The government had urged the judge to give Milken a stiff
sentence in a pre-sentencing memorandum that outlined a broader
array of crimes than those Milken admitted in his plea bargain.
   More than 200 pages of documents detailing those accusations
were released Wednesday by order of the judge.
   The defense also had released a mountain of documents refuting
the government's arguments and suggesting community service as an
alternative sentence for the fallen billionaire.
   Federal law allows a judge to consider such evidence before
passing sentence but must give the defense an opportunity to
respond.
   Wood's ruling shocked defense attorneys, who have wanted to
proceed wih the sentencing for months.
   Lead attorney Arthur Liman said, ``I was hoping we could
dispense with this.''
   He said such a hearing would ``prolong the extraordinary anguish
and agony for my client's family.''
   Wood tentatively scheduled a conference between the prosecutors
and Milken's lawyers Tuesday to further define the extent of the
extraordinary hearing. It was unclear when Milken would be
ultimately sentenced.
   Milken was not in court.
   ``Your purpose should be to shed light on the defendant's
character,'' Wood told the opposing lawyers.
   Wood's ruling made it almost certain that Milken's chief accuser
Ivan Boesky would be called to testify about the extent of his
relationship with Milken.
   But lawyers said it was unclear whether Milken would be present
in the courtroom for such proceedings.
   In their pre-sentencing memorandum, the prosecutors did not
prescribe a specific sentence for Milken, but drew a comparison to
his co-conspirator Boesky. The convicted speculator and informant
paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges, pleaded guilty
to a felony and was sentenced to a three-year term now completed.
   ``Milken stands convicted of six times as many felony charges as
Boesky and has agreed to pay six times Boesky's criminal fine and
civil penalty,'' the prosecution said.
   ``While the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic
should determine Milken's sentence, Milken's suggestion that -
facing almost six times Boesky's penalty - he merits a fraction of
his punishment is preposterous.''
   Milken, one of the nation's richest men, paid a record $600
million in penalties as part of his plea agreement.
   The government's memo, which urged a substantial prison term for
Milken, was riddled with allegations of insider trading,
manipulation, bribery and hiding evidence by Milken, going far
beyond the felonies to which he pleaded guilty. But the document
offered little in the way of new evidence to support the claims.
   It also suggsted Milken's alleged greed hastened the demise of
his former employer, the now-defunct junk-bond powerhouse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., another victim of the scandal which collapsed
earlier this year.
   Contrary to Milken's claims of a modest, humble life in which
money was secondary, the prosecution said he was obsessed with
wealth and that his enormous compensation devoured much of Drexel's
bottom line.

<HEAD>Eli Lilly Gets FDA Approval for Coronary Artery Catheter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it won approval for a
new device for treating heart patients with clogged arteries - a
catheter that removes rather than flattens the damaging plaque.
   The Simpson Coronary AtherCath is the first device that cuts,
captures and removes plaque to gain approval by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, Lilly officials said.
   The catheter is manufactured by Devices for Vascular
Intervention Inc., a California company Lilly purchased for $50
million last year.
   ``It's an important device. It has specific uses and it will add
to the tools we have available, but it's not going to sweep
everything else off the table,'' said Bruce F. Waller, a cardiac
pathologist with the Indiana Heart Institute, where doctors helped
test the device.
   Clogged arteries currently are treated with a balloon catheter,
which doctors insert into a blood vessel and snake to the
obstructed site. The balloon is expanded, flattening the plaque
against the artery wall and allowing more blood to flow through the
vessel.
   Researchers have been working on alternatives to balloon
catheters in part because about one-third of the patients treated
that way have partial blockage later. However, Waller said some
studies indicate blockage recurs in up to 40 percent of patients
treated with the atherectomy catheter.
   Because of that, Waller said the new device often will be used
just before or as a follow-up treatment with the balloon catheters.
   More than 225,000 balloon catheter procedures are performed each
year. Craig P. Baskin, an analyst with Duff and Phelps Inc. in
Chicago, estimates the new device could account for about 10
percent of the operations.

   Stock prices declined broadly today but managed
to close off their worst levels as the rising price of oil drove
investors to the sidelines.
   The decline, the sixth in seven trading days, underscored the
market's inability to seize any kind of upward momentum.
   Prices surged at the opening bell, supported by a decline in oil
prices following President Bush's announcement Wednesday that he
would sell 5 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   But traders soon realized the amount is insignificant compared
with the nation's energy needs, and with tensions escalating in the
Persian Gulf, oil prices spiked higher - briefly over a record $40
a barrel - and sent equities plunging.
   At one point the Dow Jones was industrial average was off 50
points, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's ``uptick rule,''
which restricts computer-driven program sell orders.
   The financial sector continued to take a severe beating and
served as a drag on the rest of the market. Several big bank issues
hit 52-week lows in the previous session and tumbled even further
today.

<HEAD>Bank Customers Could End Up Paying More To Cover Deposit Insurance
Hike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, `If banks ...,' to CLARIFY that customers would
lose $7.50 in interest, not savings.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

   Bank customers could pay higher fees or receive
lower interest on their savings to help make up for the 60 percent
increase in bank insurance premiums mandated by regulators,
industry analysts said Thursday.
   The insurance increase also could reduce profits in an
already-troubled industry, the analysts said.
   But they added that the higher premiums for 1991 announced
Thursday were necessary to ensure the health of the banking system.
   ``The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) needs the money,''
said Christopher Mahoney, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.
``The soundness of the FDIC is important.''
   Analysts believe many banks will try to pass on to customers
some of the premium increase in the form of higher fees for
checking accounts, bounced checks and other services. Banks also
may try to lower the interest they pay on savings accounts,
certificates of deposit and other investments.
   Under the increase, banks will pay the FDIC 19.5 cents in
insurance for each $100 in deposits starting next year. Currently,
they pay 12 cents per $100 in deposits.
   If banks were to pass on to customers the full 7.5 cent
increase, a customer with $10,000 in his savings account would lose
$7.50 in interest over a year, disregarding compounding.
   But such moves could be met with resistance and loss of
customers, analysts said.
   ``It's pretty hard to gouge the customer when the customer has
other alternatives,'' said Eric Hemel of the investment firm First
Boston Corp. He said savers could put their money in mutual funds
or other investments, or switch banks.
   That means banks may be forced to absorb some or all of the
insurance increase, which could affect their earnings and be
especially troubling to weaker institutions.
   ``Revenues at banks are not growing robustly, so any increase in
expenses is going to hurt,'' said Cheryl Swaim of the investment
firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. She estimated the higher premiums could
lower overall bank profits by 2 percent to 3 percent.
   Ms. Swaim said most banks do not disclose the percentage of
their expenses composed of FDIC fees, but one that does, First
Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C., said its FDIC cost was 3
percent of its expenses.
   ``It's not a huge chunk,'' she said. But ``for the banks that
aren't earning much money it's going to be a higher percentage of
their earnings.''
   The insurance increase could push barely profitable banks into
the red. In fact, the FDIC calculated that if the 1991 rate had
been in effect last year, 69 banks would have recorded losses
instead of profits and four additional banks would have failed.
   The American Bankers Association believes the increase also
could lower the amount of money banks have available to make loans,
said spokeswoman Ginnie Dean.
   She said the trade association supports the increase as a
necessary step, but believes changes in the FDIC insurance program
are needed. Insurance increases could be counterproductive in the
long run because of their potential to make more banks
unprofitable, she added.
   First Boston's Hemel said concern about the latest FDIC
insurance increase overlooks the bigger picture of what future
increases may be needed to bail out troubled banks as the economy
weakens. He thinks future hikes could be much larger than the 1991
increase.
   The prices of many bank stocks tumbled Thursday, but analysts
said it was due mostly to trouble reported by several major banks
in recent days, not to the insurance increase.
   On Thursday, Bank of Boston said it expected to report a loss
this quarter and would reduce its quarterly dividend by two-thirds.
   On Wednesday, NCNB Corp., a bank based in Charlotte, N.C., said
it would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and would
increase its reserves for potentially bad loans.
   And last week, Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's
second-largest bank, said it expects a loss this quarter and would
cut its dividend in half.

   After 20 years of negotiations, Italy and the United
States signed a memorandum Thursday that will allow Italy's
flagship airline to land in four additional U.S. cities.
   The government-owned Alitalia will offer year-round service to
Boston, Miami, Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia with the option
to add four more destinations in the near future.
   It currently has regular flights to New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago, and flies seasonally to Boston.
   The accord takes effect on October 29th, when Alitalia begins
its service to Miami.
   The memorandum of understanding also permits three U.S. carriers
to fly to Italian cities. Until now, only two U.S. carriers - Pan
American World Airways and Trans World Airlines - have had
U.S.-Italy flights.
   American Airlines has already been approved for Italian flights
and will begin flying from Chicago to Milan or Rome in 1991.
   The other two, to begin their flights in 1992 and 1994, will be
chosen by the U.S. Department of Transportation from among Delta,
Northwestern, United and Continental.

<HEAD>GM to Repair Flaking Paint on Some Vehicles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. dealers will offer free
paint jobs to approximately 324,000 vehicles that may have had
their coats damaged by ultraviolet light, the automaker said
Thursday.
   Paint on some of the vehicles has flaked because ultraviolet
light penetrates the topcoat of paint, damages the base primer and
causes a loss of adhesion between the surfaces, the automaker said
in a written statement.
   GM will inspect and repair about 230,000 1987-90 Chevrolet
Berettas or Corsicas painted sapphire blue, medium sapphire blue,
silver or gunmetal gray at no charge to the owner, the release
said.
   Also to be repaired are about 93,500 1988-89 Chevrolet S-10
Blazers, S-10 pickups, GMC S-15 Jimmys and S-15 pickups painted
bright blue, dark blue or gray metallic, the company said.
   The repair polcies are valid for three years from the date the
vehicle was placed in service. For owners of the cars or light
trucks that have passed that date, the refinishing offer will be
extended another 12 months to Sept. 30, 1991, the release said.
   If vehicle owners already have paid for paint repairs, the
company will reimburse them, the No. 1 automaker said.

<HEAD>U.S. Merger Activity Edges Up in 3rd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. merger activity picked up slightly during
the third quarter from the previous three months but continued to
fall back sharply from 1989 levels, according to statistics
released Thursday.
   The value of domestic mergers rose 7 percent from July through
September when compared with the second quarter, said Securities
Data Corp., a business research firm.
   During the third quarter, there were 941 deals worth a total of
$58.6 billion announced, against 1,284 deals worth $47.8 billion
announced in the second quarter, the company said.
   The pace was sharply lower from the 1,231 transactions worth
$139.4 billion announced in the third quarter of 1989. The
year-earlier levels were already down sharply from 1988, when the
takeover boom hit its peak.
   The mergers business began to slow in early 1989 and then
changed dramatically after last fall's collapse of the junk bond
market made financing for deals harder to come by.
   In compiling its statistics, Securities Data considered
transactions including mergers, acquisitions, repurchases,
spin-offs, self-tenders of stock, minority stake purchases and
leveraged recapitalizations.
   The number of stock repurchases increased during the third
quarter as some companies took advantage of lower prices on Wall
Street and began to buy back their shares.
   The Dow Jones industrial average reached a high of 2,999.75 on
July 16 and 17, but has fallen more than 570 points since then as
concerns about the economy and tensions in the Persian Gulf sent
stock prices tumbling.
   Over the first three quarters of 1990, domestic merger activity
fell 52 percent from a year earlier, with 3,306 deals valued at
$151.2 billion announced, down from 3,734 deals worth $333 billion,
Securities Data said.
   Securities Data said global merger activity also declined, but
the value of British transactions increased 75 percent in the third
quarter from the second quarter.
   There were 318 deals worth $24.1 billion involving British firms
from July through September, up from 319 deals worth $13.7 billion
the previous quarter, the company said.

<HEAD>Allied Bondholders Press for Right to Sue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee representing bondholders of Allied
Stores Corp. asked a bankruptcy judge Thursday for permission to
sue Allied's owners and banks, alleging they fraudulently took
money out of the company.
   Bondholders' lawyers argued that the threat of a lawsuit - which
would seek damages of at least $700 million and possibly $1 billion
- might prod the targets to settle the claims.
   ``I suggest that it's very important these issues be resolved,''
said Jonathan Jacobson, a lawyer on the bondholders' committee
representing investors in Allied. ``It is critical that the
defendants face the prospect of judicial reckoning.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. took the case under
review. He did not say when he would rule.
   His permission is needed for the litigation to proceed because
Aug is overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of
Allied and its sister retailer, Cincinnati-based Federated
Department Stores Inc.
   In a Sept. 6 letter, the bondholders' lawyers said the
prospective defendants in the lawsuit could include: Toronto-based
Campeau Corp., which bought Allied in 1986; Federated Stores Inc.,
which is Campeau's U.S. retailing subsidiary; Bank of Montreal;
Banque Paribas; Citibank, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., First Boston
Corp., and former officers and directors of Allied.
   Bondholders contend that up to $1 billion in proceeds from
Allied's 1989 sale of the Ann Taylor store division and 1988 sale
of Brooks Brothers were fraudulently conveyed to buy worthless
stock or to pay off bank debt. The transactions stripped assets
from Allied to the detriment of its investors, the bondholders
allege.
   The lawyers gave advance notice of the lawsuit to meet a
requirement by Aug.
   Lawyers for Allied and several targets of the threatened lawsuit
asked Aug to prevent its filing, saying it could slow the
reorganization. They also argued that it could become a tangled
litigation involving multiple parties and said it should be up to
Allied, not the bondholders, to resolve the claims since Allied has
primary responsibility for charting its reorganization.
   Allied lawyer John Newman said the proposed lawsuit could become
a ``wide-screen cinema production.''
   Jacobson asked Aug to permit the bondholders to sue on or after
Feb. 28, 1991, the deadline which ends the period in which Allied
and Federated have the exclusive right to file their reorganization
plans. After that, creditors may file their own suggested
reorganization plans.
   In another matter, Aug approved a request from Federated and
Allied to appoint a committee to represent the interests of retired
non-union employees of the companies in the reorganization.
   The judge also approved Allied's sale of a company jet, a
Gulfstream III, to the Deluxe Corp. of St. Paul, Minn., for $11.9
million.
   Federated and Allied filed reorganization petitions Jan. 15,
listing more than $7.7 billion in debts. Most of those debts were
acquired because of borrowings by Campeau Corp. to buy Allied in
1986 and Federated in 1988.

   The dollar weakened Thursday against all major
currencies except the Japanese yen, which remained pressured by
rising oil prices and another sharp decline on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   Gold prices retreated after rising overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $405 a troy ounce, down $2 from late Wednesday.
Republic National Bank in New York also quoted a late bid for gold
at $405 an ounce, down $1.70.
   Currency dealers said trading was slow and in a broad range in
the absence of any fundamental news.
   ``The market has no clear direction and it probably won't until
the budget situation is resolved and something happens in the
Middle East,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president and dealer at
Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   ``(The market) is being constantly buffeted by rumors.''
   Johnson said the dollar was hurt by speculation of a budget
compromise in Washington but supported by rumors of escalating
tensions between the United States and Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   The confrontation between the two countries, following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last month, has brought a sharp rise in oil
price throughout the world.
   Particularly hard hit has been Japan, which imports about 95
percent of its petroleum. On Thursday, stock prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange sank to 33-month lows as oil prices continued to
advance.
   The dollar gained ground against the yen everywhere.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed up 137.50 Japanese yen from 137.40 yen
Wednesday. It traded at 138.45 yen in London, and at 137.98 yen in
New York, up from 136.855.
   But the dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling rose
to $1.8690 from $1.8635 in London, and to $1.8780 from $1.8718 in
New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.5610 German marks, down from 1.5660; 1.2925
Swiss francs, down from 1.3025; 5.2250 French fracs, down from
5.2410; 1,169.25 Italian lire, down from 1,172.00; and 1.15495
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15635.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday: 1.5685
German marks, down from 1.5715; 1.3055 Swiss francs, down from
1.3110; 5.2555 French francs, down from 5.2615; 1.7695 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.7725; 1,175.50 Italian lire, down from
1,176.00; and 1.1573 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1535.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $405.75 an ounce fro
$404.85 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $406 an ounce, up
from $402.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.12 to close at $403.29 an
ounce.
   Silver prices retreated. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.771 a troy ounce, down 2.7 cents
from late Wednesday. Silver fell in London to $4.80 an ounce from
$4.81.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge fined USX Corp. $4.1
million Thursday and ordered two union officials to prison for
their role in a scheme to get inflated pensions in exchange for
approving a major labor pact.
   The fine was the maximum the company could have received after
being convicted in July of conspiracy, mail fraud and violating
federal labor laws.
   In addition to the fine, U.S. District Judge E.B. Haltom also
ordered USX to pay restitution of $289,995 to two pension funds
that prosecutors claimed were depleted as part of the 1983 plan.
   Haltom sentenced United Steelworkers Union officials E.B. Rich
and Thermon Phillips to 36 months and 30 months in prison,
respectively. The men, who faced as long as 37 months in prison,
also were fined $6,000 each.
   Phillips released a statement saying the sentence was unjust,
but representatives of the company and Rich declined comment.
   The judge said he was tougher on Rich, a regional subdirector,
than Phillips, the regional union director, because evidence showed
Rich was behind the plot.
   Both men were allowed to remain free on their original $500
bonds until Nov. 27, when Haltom ordered them to report to an
unspecified minimum-security federal prison.
   During a 4{-month trial, prosecutors alleged Phillips and Rich
illegally negotiated inflated pensions for themselves and four
other union officials during talks that led to the reopening of
USX's Fairfield Works in Birmingham.
   Both men denied any collusion, as did USX. Both the company and
the men plan to appeal.
   Federal prosecutors said Rich received a USX pension based on
about 31 years of work, although he actually was employed for 13
years. Phillips' pension was based on about 38 years of work, but
he had only worked for the company from 1946 to 1951, when it was
known as U.S. Steel.

<HEAD>Money Supply Fell in Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply declined in the week ended Sept. 17, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,316.1 billion from $3,317.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,093.7 billion from $4,097.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, held at a
seasonally adjusted $820.7 billion, the same as the prior week's
revised level. The previous week's M1 total was originally reported
as $820.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is five percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 1.8 percent, which is at the low
end of the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,296.1 billion, a 2.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,081.8 billion, up 1.2 percent, while M1
rose 3.9 percent to an average of $814.2 billion.
   In another report:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $513 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$974 million the previous week.

   The stock market declined broadly again Thursday
as higher oil prices spooked investors.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 32.17 points to
2,427.48. The key index lost nearly 26 points on Wednesday.
   Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by about 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,182 down, 395 up and 422 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 182.69 million
shares, up from 155.57 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 222.55 million shares.
   Stocks started the day on a strong note, with the Dow surging
more than 20 points at the opening bell as traders drew
encouragement from lower oil prices. But the enthusiasm was
short-lived.
   The markets soon realized President Bush's move to sell 5
million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would do
little to satisfy the nation's energy needs. Oil prices climbed
higher, with the near-term crude contract briefly topping $40 a
barrel.
   The rise in oil prices quickly convinced investors to dump
equities. At one point the Dow was off 50 points, triggering the
New York Stock Exchange's ``uptick rule,'' which restricts
computer-driven program sell orders.
   The financial sector continued to take a severe beating, which
served as a drag on the rest of the market. Regulators voted
Thursday to raise banks' deposit insurance premiums by more than 60
percent in 1991, a move analysts said could cut profits in an
already troubled industry.
   ``The bank stocks are the hate group for the moment,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, a senior vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons
Inc. in St. Louis. He said stories were being conjured up ``by the
minute about money-center banks going belly up.''
   The Bank of Boston, which fell &rsqb; to a 52-week low of 7&lsqb;,
announced it will cut its dividend, post a $250 million quarterly
loss and seek 1,500 job cuts. NCNB fell 3&lsqb; to 20&lsqb;; it announced
late Wednesday that it was increasing its reserves to cover problem
debt.
   Among other heavily traded bank issues, Citicorp lost } to 13};
Continental Bank was down | at 7&rsqb;; Manfuacturers Hanover was down 1
at 20\; BankAmerica lost } to 19\, and Chase Manhattan fell &lsqb; to
11.
   Among other actively traded Big Board issues, General Electric

IBM was down 1 at 104&rsqb;, and Philip Morris was down | at 44.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $40.06 billion, or 1.42
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
2.16 to 165.36.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.89 to 355.10, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 4.09 to 300.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

   Aldo Papone, chairman of American Express Travel
Related Services Co. Inc., will retire Jan. 1, the American Express
Co. unit announced Thursday.
   Papone will be succeeded by two co-chairmen, Edwin M. Cooperman,
president of the unit's North American division, and G. Richard
Thoman, president of American Express International, the company
said. The two men also will serve as co-chief executive officers of
the unit.
   Papone, who has held his post since April 1989, will become a
senior adviser to American Express Co., reporting to Chairman James
D. Robinson III. Papone also will continue as a member of the
parent company's board of directors.
   ``This completes a management evolution that began almost 18

   Cooperman, an 18-year American Express veteran, is credited with

executive since 1979, is in charge of the company's traveler's
check business and its travel services operations outside North
America, among other duties.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Announces Major Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. announced Thursday it
would sell some assets and reorganize one of its principle
subsidiaries under a restructuring plan expected to produce $600
million in after-tax proceeds.
   The plan calls for the Danbury-based company to sell up to half
the equity in one subsidiary, while selling off its interest in two
businesses and restructuring its industrial gases business. It also
includes buying back up to 14 percent of its common stock.
   About half of the $600 million in proceeds will be used to
reduce the company's staggering debt, which totaled $3.25 billion
at the end of the second quarter, said Thomas F. Sprick, spokesman
for Union Carbide.
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, Union
Carbide stock closed up 62{ cents at $14.87{.
   One analyst said the plan was a step in the right direction, but
wouldn't change the fortunes of Union Carbide, which suffered a 38
percent decline in second-quarter earnings.
   ``This is good, but it could have been better. It could have
been a lot better,'' said Harvey S. Stober, a chemical analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``They should joint venture
their industrial gas corporation with a strong industrial gas
producer in Europe. ... That is the jewel in this company.''
   Under the plan, Union Carbide would sell up to 50 percent of the
equity in its UCAR Carbon Company Inc. subsidiary, a major supplier
of carbon and graphite electrodes to the steel industry.
   The sale is expected to result in a one-time after-tax book loss
of up to $90 million, said Robert D. Kennedy, Carbide's chairman
and chief executive officer. UCAR's sales last year totaled $802
million.
   The book loss from the UCAR sale will be offset by an expected
$40 million profit from the sale of Union Carbide's interest in two
companies, he said.
   Plans call for Union Carbide to sell off its 50 percent interest
in KEMET Electronics Corp., which supplies capacitors, and Lincare
Inc., a home oxygen and respiratory care supplier. The company did
not disclose the expected selling prices.
   The restructuring also calls for Union Carbide to form five
independent regional companies within its packaged gases
subsidiary, Union Carbide Industrial Gas Company Inc.
   The companies will be formed after certain assets and businesses
valued at approximately $55 million are divested, Kennedy said.
Other businesses will also be added, he said.
   Domestic sales of packaged gases last year totaled $300 million.
   Union Carbide will also repurchase 20 million shares of common
stock, about 14 percent of its total common outstanding, through a
tender offer, Kennedy said.
   An employee stock ownership plan is also part of the
restructuring, allowing workers to become majority owners of the
new industrial gases companies, Kennedy said.
   The employee stock ownership plan will be funded through an
independently managed trust that will borrow $325 million to
purchase shares of a new issue of convertible preferred stock from
Union Carbide.
   Kennedy said the restructuring plan is designed to establish
Union Carbide as a leading global chemical company, focused on
being the low-cost preferred supplier for its industries.

<HEAD>Gold Tumbles With Silver and Platinum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices reversed a three-day trend and tumbled Thursday
despite modest gains in crude oil prices as speculators began to
re-establish gold's traditional role in the market.
   On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their
losses; energy futures rose slightly; wheat and soybean futures
were mostly higher; meat futures were higher; and corn was lower.
   Gold continued to rise this week despite the fact that silver
and platinum - which the gold market usually follows - plummeted to
their lowest levels in years.
   Gold settled $1.90 to $2.20 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at $405.00 a
troy ounce.
   Silver and platinum extended their losses following weak
economic activity in the United States, analysts said.
   Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $10.70 to
$11.60 lower with October at $437.30 a troy ounce.
   Silver fell 3 cents to 2.7 cents on the Commodity Exchange with
October at $4.771 an ounce.
   Gold's downturn Thursday could signal that speculators are
getting over fears of war in the Middle East and are looking more
toward inflation and a possible recession, where they would be more
inclined to hoard their money, analysts said.
   ``Gold has been trading on the emotion of the market and has
always been an emotional safe haven for people in times of
distress,'' said Nina Lipton, vice president of Platinum Guild
International in New York. ``I think the market is acting on
impressions, not reality.''
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat, soybean and corn futures
had an unremarkable day of trading.
   Wheat futures prices extended Wednesday's gains after the
Agriculture Department confirmed reports that it has offered to
sell subsidized flour to the Soviet Union, Morocco and other West
African countries.
   Soybean futures prices followed wheat's lead after the USDA also
reported the Soviet Union might be interested in buying soybean
meal, said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Corn futures prices were mostly lower in thin, quiet trading
after morning weather reports predicted near-ideal harvest weather
over the next week. Such good weather hold prices lower because
there is no fear of shortages.
   The USDA grain stocks report also was a factor in the thin
trading, some analysts said. But Spilka said after the report's
release at the close of trading that it should have little effect
on Friday's market.
   ``In the past, the numbers have been all over the map,'' he
said. ``I wouldn't place great emphasis on the report having much
influence.''
   Soybeans, which analysts estimated would average 249 million
bushels, came in at 239 million; corn, estimated at 1.34 billion
bushels, came in at 1.34 billion; and wheat, estimated at 2.469
billion bushels, came in the low end of trade expectations at 2.402
billion bushels.
   The numbers represent the government's estimate on the stockpile
of grains as of Sept. 1.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.77{ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to
1\ cents higher with December at $2.27{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent
lower to 1} cents higher with December at $1.16 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 5 cents higher with November at $6.19\ a bushel.
   Meat futures rebounded after three days of losses amid optimism
that a federal budget agreement could be reached by Monday. House
Speaker Thomas Foley made that announcement early in the day, which
relieved fears that a budget impasse would trigger spending cuts
and shut down the U.S. packing industry.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 79
cents a pound; feeder cattle was .05 cent lower to .73 cent higher
with September at 89.35 cents a pound; hogs were .40 cent lower to
.13 cent higher with October at 53.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to 1.50 cents higher with February at 57.37
cents a pound.
   Energy futures continued to rise despite President Bush's
announcement that 5 million gallons of the nation's oil reserves
would be sold.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 36 cents to $1.05 higher with
November at $39.54 a barrel; heating oil was 1.26 cents to 1.80
cents higher with October at $1.0437 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was 1.85 cents to 2.59 cents higher with October at $1.0269 a
gallon.

   Milan Stone, president of the United Rubber
Workers, was ousted from control of the 110,000-member union
Thursday in an election upset that also will cost him his job as a
vice president of the parent AFL-CIO.
   Stone, who had headed the Akron, Ohio-based union since 1981,
was rebuffed by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Delegates meeting for a
convention in Florida instead favored Ken Coss, who had been
Stone's No. 2 man as the union's secretary-treasurer.
   Stone's loss means he eventually will have to relinquish his
influential post as one of 34 vice presidents of the 14.2
million-member AFL-CIO.
   He does not have to step down from the labor federation's
executive council until his current term expires in November 1991,
but other vice presidents who have been evicted from power by their
own union often resign sooner.
   Coss had run on a pledge to make the union more active and
progressive, while Stone's backers had pushed him as an experienced
leader who had kept the union together during plant closings. Since
1975, union membership has fallen by about 60,000.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil testified Thursday he
was a ``go-between'' for a controversial line of credit extended by
the failed thrift where he was a director. But he insisted his
actions involved no conflict.
   Bush was testy at times as he testified on the third day of a
hearing on the government's conflict-of-interest allegations
against him.
   Bush, 35, was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, which collapsed in 1988 at an estimated cost to
taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision brought the action against
Bush, which could lead to his being barred from the banking
industry. The OTS alleges that Bush failed to adequately inform
fellow Silverado directors of his business ties with developers
Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, who eventually defaulted on more
than $132 million in Silverado loans.
   Last week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued Bush and
other former Silverado directors for $200 million, alleging that
gross negligence on their part contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.
   Bush told Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson he ``had
absolutely no doubt'' his dealings with Good and Walters did not
conflict with his role as a Silverado director.
   Consequently, Bush said, he did not consult with Silverado's
management about the question of a potential conflict.
   Bush insisted several times that, although Good and Walters
invested in his oil company, JNB Exploration, he had no financial
interest in the projects for which they got loans from Silverado.
   Previous testimony, however, showed that Silverado extended a
$900,000 line of credit to a partnership formed by Bush and Good to
explore for oil and gas in Argentina. The line of credit, intended
to convince Argentine officials that the venture had strong
financial resources, never was used.
   Under questioning from a government attorney, Bush said lawyers
for Good's company suggested that Bush present the credit line
proposal to Silverado's board.
   ``I was a go-between,'' Bush said.
   Bush maintained there was no conflict in his role because he
didn't stand to gain any financial benefit from the credit line,
which he described as a sort of ``letter of referral,'' and because
he abstained from voting on the proposal.
   Pressed by OTS attorney Stephen Hershkowitz, however, Bush later
admitted he had hoped the partnership would eventually benefit from
the credit line, since it would persuade the Argentine government
to permit the venture to drill wells in that country.
   ``I didn't know if we would (benefit); I hoped that we would,''
he said.
   Bush also said he couldn't remember if it was his own idea to
abstain from voting on the line of credit or if someone suggested
it to him.
   The judge will examine testimony from the hearing and recommend
what sanctions, if any, should be taken against the president's
son.
   Bush also said he used what he obliquely called ``the Smith
smell test'' to evaluate a $150,000 investment by Walters in Bush's
oil company.
   ``If it smelled - if my name was Mr. Smith, would they be coming
to me for an investment? And, you know, that would be the test,''
he said.
   The company used the money to help finance an oil-drilling
venture in Wyoming in the mid-1980s that never made a profit.
   Bush told Davidson that under his ``test,'' he would
automatically reject any proposal that he deemed politically
motivated.
   ``I gave him a very good deal,'' Bush said of Walters. ``It was
a very strong economic deal for him, and had we been successful, he
would have made a lot of money.''
   Bush said several times he could not recall whether he had
discussions with fellow Silverado directors about the specifics of
his dealings with Good and Walters.
   ``That was five years ago,'' Bush said. ``I don't recall the
specific discussions, but the discussions took place or there
wouldn't have been a general awareness.''
   At several points, Davidson warned Bush to answer questions
directly and not to interrupt Hershkowitz.
   ``I'm sorry,'' Bush told the judge. ``My lawyer advised me that
I should listen. I'm sorry.''
   The judge told Bush to be patient.
   ``You're not going to be fooled or tricked by anyone as far as
I'm concerned,'' Davidson said.
   Also testifying was Florian Barth, another former Silverado
director who on Tuesday had refused to do so.
   Barth said Thursday he was not aware of Bush's specific business
ties with Good and Walters, although he knew about the
relationships.
   ``There might have been more discussion taking place if we had
known certain things,'' Barth said. ``Knowing more about the facts
might have made a difference.''

<HEAD>Bank Of Boston Says It Will Cut Dividend, Report Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp. said Thursday it expects to
report a loss of at least $200 million this quarter as it announced
plans to slash its quarterly dividend by two-thirds and cut its
staff by 1,500 employees.
   Bank of Boston joined a growing list of banks that are reducing
payments to stockholders and curtailing expenses in the wake of a
declining economy and troubles with real estate loans.
   Ira Stepanian, Bank of Boston's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the moves are necessary to conserve the institution's
capital base.
   ``We are taking decisive and admittedly painful actions,''
Stepanian said.
   He said the bank expects to show a loss after taxes of $200 to
$250 million this quarter, which ends Sunday, resulting in red ink
of up to $200 million for the first nine months of the year.
   The dividend cut, to 10 cents a share from 31 cents, is expected
to conserve about $43 million yearly.
   The bank said the expected loss stems from several factors,
including additions to loan loss reserves of $150 million to $200
million; an expected writeoff of bad loans totaling $175 million,
chiefly on real estate; and $50 million in charges related to the
staff reductions and other cutbacks.
   Bank of Boston is a regional bank holding company with assets of
$37 billion. It owns banks in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut,
Rhode Island and Vermont.
   Stepanian said the staff reduction will begin immediately with a
voluntary plan that offers benefits for employees wishing to leave.
   Stepanian said the bank is still expanding its retail operations
and increasing its marketing efforts.
   James E. Moynihan Jr., an analyst with the investment firm
Advest Inc. in Boston, said the announcement was expected. ``The
market place had discounted this news long ago. This stock value
has been cut in half for the last six weeks,'' he said.
   But, Moynihan added, ``The news really isn't quite as bad as it
had been thought.''
   Bank of Boston's stock fell 37{ cents a share to close at $7.12{
in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday.
   Also Thursday, Bank of New England-West, based in Springfield,
laid off 201 of its 1,125 employees as part of a plan to cut its
work force by about 30 percent before the end of the year.
   The bank also announced plans to sell four branches and
consolidate 11 branch offices. The moves are part of a recovery
plan by the bank's troubled parent, Bank of New England Corp. of
Boston
   Stock prices of other banks also fell Thursday. Industry
analysts attributed it to a spate of bad news recently by a number
of banks.
   On Wednesday, NCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., said it
would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and increase its
reserves for potentially bad loans.
   Last week, Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's second-largest
bank, said it also expected a quarterly loss and would cut its
dividend in half.

<HEAD>California Investor Makes New Offer for United's Employee Buyout
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A year after failing to takeover UAL Corp.,
California billionaire Marvin Davis suggested he should buy the
parent of United Airlines and give employees an opportunity to buy
him out in two years, officials said Thursday.
   ``We propose to effectively bridge the acquisition of UAL for
its labor and employee groups for a period of two years,'' Davis
said in a letter to the United Employee Acquisition Corp.
   The employee group, which faces an Oct. 9 deadline for financing
its own buyout plan, said it doesn't expect to need the help.
   In a letter dated Wednesday, Davis proposed negotiating a merger
with UAL in which employees would receive 20 percent ownership of
the company and agree to union contract concessions amounting to
comparable value.
   The employees would have the option to buy Davis' controlling
position in UAL after two years, Davis said.
   ``We believe we have found a solution which both facilitates
labor's acquisition of UAL and provides stockholders fair value for
their investment,'' he said in the letter to Gerald Greenwald,
chief executive officer of the employee-led buyout group.
   Davis did not suggest a purchase price in the letter.
   The pilots, flight attendants and machinists unions have offered
$201 a share, or $4.38 billion, for UAL. The company directors
accepted the offer, but the employee group has had trouble coming
up with the financing.
   The employee group failed to meet a deadline in August and was
given a two-month extension by the directors. The board said then
that if the financing was not in place by Oct. 9 the deal would be
off.
   Greenwald said in a statement released Thursday in New York that
the employees expected to be able to pull off their acquisition
without Davis.
   ``UEAC is optimistic that it will be able to finance and
complete a proposal of its own,'' Greenwald said.
   ``... Accordingly, we do not expect any action will be taken on
the proposal contained in Mr. Davis' letter.''
   In August 1989 Davis offered $5.4 billion, or $240 a share, for
UAL and later upped the bid to $6.19 billion or $275 a share.
   A month later, the corporation's directors accepted a bid of
6.75 billion, or $300 a share - plus employee concessions - in a
deal with United's pilots, management and British Airways PLC. The
next day Davis offered to match that bid with no demand for
concessions.
   A month after that, the employee takeover planned collapsed for
lack of financing, and Davis withdrew his matching bid.
   The latest employee offer was devised in the spring and accepted
by the board April 6.

<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. on Thursday decided to suspend
its common stock dividend, choosing to pay off debt with the $40
million normally paid to shareholders each quarter.
   The announcement sent Unisys stock to a new low for the year of
$5.37{ a share, down 23 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Company officials said suspending the dividend would ultimately
benefit shareholders by helping improve the overall financial
structure of the company.
   ``This was the best way to accelerate our progress in improving
the capital structure,'' company spokesman Peter Hynes said after
the board of directors meeting in Detroit.
   Unisys, based in nearby Blue Bell, owed $3.6 billion on June 30,
down from a peak $4.1 billion in the middle of 1989, Hynes said.
The computer company reported a $639 million loss last year.
   Hynes said debt was cut $325 million in the first six months of
this year, and the company's goal was to reduce it by $600 million
to $800 million in 1990.
   The company showed meager profits for the first part of the
year, but they were not enough to cover payment of preferred
dividends. The poor performance prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to
drop its rating on Unisys' debt and preferred stock to just one
notch above junk-bond status.
   The second-quarter profit of $11.8 million became a $15.1
million loss after dividends on preferred stock were paid. These
dividends were not affected by Thursday's decision.
   The third quarter ends Sunday, and the projections are not good.
   ``All we can say is we project a loss and a profit in fourth,''
Hynes said.
   James A. Unruh, Unisys president and chief executive officer,
said a poor economic climate influenced the board's decision.
   ``The conclusion was that this is simply not an appropriate
point in the company's history to pay high dividends,'' Unruh said
in a prepared statement.
   Unisys has made no decision about when the annual $1 common
stock dividend will be restored, Hynes said. The company will wait
for ``better profitability, a lower debt'' and an upturn in the
sluggish economy, he said.
   Hynes said the quarterly dividend has been 25 cents a share at a
cost of $40 million.
   Other steps toward debt reduction include the sales of real
estate and ``non-strategic'' businesses, Hynes said.
   Last week, Unisys unveiled a computer line aimed at upgrading
mini-computers made by its stiffest competition, IBM Corp.
Mini-computers fall midway between personal computers and large
mainframes and can support several users at one time.
   The announcement was unusual in that IBM and Unisys make
computers that are not designed to be mixed and matched with the
equipment of other companies.

<TEXT>
   A state board heard last-minute support and
objections Thursday to a sweeping anti-smog plan that would force
production of low-emission vehicles and distribution of cleaner
fuels.
   The core of the plan is: A vehicle and its fuel are one system
in regard to exhaust emissions. Therefore, reducing emissions
demands changes in both.
   The California Air Resources Board will vote on the plan Friday.
   The plan seeks to overcome the Catch-22 of building
alternative-fuel cars when the fuel is unavailable, or marketing
cleaner-burning fuels when there are no cars to use those fuels.
   It would also require fuel companies to distribute a certain
amount of alternative fuel to ensure availability.
   Meanwhile Thursday, New York's Environmental Board adopted auto
emission and durability standards equal to California's, the
nation's strictest.
   The new regulations, which take effect in the 1993 model year,
are expected to be adopted by 1995 in seven other northeastern
states. They require mandatory inspection of exhaust emissions and
assembly-line testing and prohibit the sale of replacement parts
that do not meet emission standards.
   Among the cleaner-burning fuels being considered in the even
stricter California proposal are methanol, ethanol, liquefied
natural gas and compressed natural gas. Cars powered by electricity
are also a possibility.
   With filthy air hanging over California cities and roads jammed
with 22 million cars, opponents are careful not to criticize the
entire proposal but to target certain points.
   Oil companies want the state board to abandon mandatory
distribution volume quotas for the new fuels because there is no
way to force consumers to buy them.
   Automakers say they are concerned about the timetable for
designing, testing and introducing new vehicles, as well as
uncertainty of the technology and the need for marketing
incentives.
   George Babikian, president of Atlantic Richfield Co., urged the
board to eliminate mandatory distribution in favor of mandatory
``availability.''
   The plan anticipates introduction of flexible-fuel vehicles
which run on either gasoline or methnol blends. Given the choice,
Babikian contends, a driver will choose gasoline because it is 30
to 40 cents cheaper per gallon.
   If distribution were mandatory, oil companies would lower the
price of methanol to sell it and subsidize the alternative fuel by
raising the price of gasoline, he said.
   The plan would, between 1994 and 2003, require the use of cars
that are 50 percent to 84 percent less polluting than those which
meet the current strictest standards. The state agency would test
the cars' emissions before licensing them.
   In the first year about 200,000 ``ultra clean'' cars would be
required, about 10 percent of annual new car sales in California.
By 2003, the regulation would cover all 2 million cars sold
annually.
   The board also would mandate production of so-called
zero-emission electric cars starting in 1998. Up to 200,000
electric cars could be in the state by the year 2003, the ARB
contends.
   The board says the plan is expected to reduce emissions of
hydrocarbons by 28 percent, or 185 tons per day; nitrogen oxide by
18 percent, or 248 tons per day; and carbon monoxide by 8 percent,
or 3.17 tons per day.
   The plan would take effect in the South Coast Air Basin, which
encompasses smoggy Los Angeles, before going statewide. The
regulations could be challenged in court.
   ``Certainly a nation that has the capability of building an
airplane that you can't see, a submarine that you can't hear, can
get electric cars built to get us to work and back,'' David
Friedman, general manager of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, an electrical power utility, said at the hearing.
   ``If the government can put one on the moon, surely Detroit can
put one on the road.''
   James Lents, executive officer of the local South Coast Air
Quality Management District, hailed the plan as essential to the
district.
   ``We must continually remind ourselves that our 13 million
residents breathe the most polluted air in the nation, and it
impairs their lifestyle and health,'' Lents told board members.

<HEAD>Bush May Take Compromise on Capital Gains, Republicans Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 1 graf for 4th graf, The White, with talks ending for
evening; should stand</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may be willing to drop his
insistence for a cut in the capital gains tax, Republican
congressmen said Wednesday, a demand that has been the major
obstacle to a budget deal.
   But the apparent softening of Bush's position was revealed on a
day when Bush and congressional Democrats had their most withering
public flare-up over the talks in weeks.
   The two sides accused each other of endangering their stalled
bargaining, just five days before disruptive cuts in government
services will be imposed if the negotiations fail.
   The White House signalled a willingess to consider keeping the
current capital gains tax rate - the same as ordinary income - but
exempting gains due to inflation. Democrats brushed aside the idea,
and after nearly six hours negotiators broke off discussions for
the evening at nearly 11:30 p.m.
   Bush said nothing about his reported change in his capital gains
stance as he campaigned for Republican candidates in Ohio.
   ``The hang-up is with the Democrats,'' he said, accusing them of
refusing to do their part to cut the deficit.
   ``If and when the ax falls, the Democratic Congress knows that
it will be held accountable,'' he said. ``And I will take that
message to every state in the union. It is their fault.''
   He also told reporters while flying to Ohio that Democrats
``have not come forward with a package'' at the talks, a remark
that touched off a Democratic uproar.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Democrats have made several
offers in recent bargaining sessions.
   ``To begin a series of charges or countercharges ... at this
stage is not helpful,'' Foley said. ``It is damaging to the talks,
though we're determined it not be critically damaging.''
   Mitchell said the president must have been ``badly misinformed''
to have made the comment, and called it ``highly misleading and
damaging.''
   The Foley-Mitchell complaints led Bush to apologize at a later
speech in Chicago: ``Earlier today, I said the Democrats have not
come forward with a package. They say they have put a package, or
at least a series of proposals, on the table in private
negotiations. I accept the fact that in private negotiations there
have been such proposals. I apologize for misspeaking on that
point.''
   However, he said, ``We have yet to see a comprehensive plan''
that encmpasses the goals of serious spending cuts, budget process
change and incentives for economic growth.
   Hundreds of unionized federal workers rallied outside the
Capitol at noon to demand a quick solution to the budget crisis.
They carried signs reading, ``Your furlough begins Nov. 6, Election
Day,'' and ``Congress, you do your jobs so we can do ours.''
   The rally was organized by the American Federation of Government
Employees, which represents 700,000 federal workers.
   Inside the building, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to apply
the spending cuts to the salaries of members of Congress and top
executive branch officials, including Vice President Quayle and
members of the Cabinet - items now exempt under the Gramm-Rudman
budget-cutting law.
   After a morning meeting at the White House, GOP lawmakers said
Bush was signalling compromise. Instead of lowered capital gains
tax rates, Bush might accept other items he believes would spur the
economy, they said.
   ``He might be willing to look at other alternatives in the
growth area,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, said
the alternatives could include corporate tax breaks designed to
encourage research and to prod businesses to operate in ailing
urban and rural areas.
   The developments occurred as negotiators for the White House and
Congress were resuming their search for a package of tax increases
and spending cuts that could reduce the deficit by $500 billion
over five years.
   Republican bargainers continued to present various offers
involving a reduced capital gains tax, which is imposed on profits
from the sale of property, said officials who asked to not be
identified.
   One version would tax only the increased value of an asset that
exceeds inflation, but Democrats said they wanted ``absolutely
nothing to do with capital gains,'' said one official.
   Hanging over the bargainers was the prospect of $85 billion in
potentially disruptive cuts scheduled to take place automatically
Monday - reductions that could result in furloughs for as many as
2.1 million federal workers and curtail government programs as
diverse as air traffic control to food inspections.
   If the cuts take effect, affected domestic programs would be
slashed by 32.4 percent and defense programs by 35.3 percent.
   Social Security, the military payroll and many benefits for
veterans and low-income people are exempt from the cuts.
   With no spending legislation in place for the new fiscal year,
which starts Monday, the House prepared to decide whether to
provide temporary financing for the government. Democratic leaders
were ready to delay the vote until Friday or later in hopes of
reaching a budget compromise.
   A vote was also planned on whether to postpone the approaching
spending cuts, with Bush vowing to block any delay.
   ``It is the law of the land, and I took an oath to the
Constitution to the land,'' Bush said about the pending cuts.
``We've tried to do our part.''
   Participants in the budget talks reported progress in a late
night session Tuesday, particularly over the size of cuts in the
military and Medicare, which provides health care for the elderly.
   The talks on a deficit deal have been bogged down for weeks, and
participants on both sides have said the president's insistence on
a cut in the tax in profits from investments has been a major
stumbling block.
   Democrats have called for an increase in income tax rates for
the wealthy to offset any benefits from the cut that Bush wants.
   The president has been insisting on a capital gains tax cut out
of the belief that it would stimulate the economy at a time of
economcc slowdown. Many economists believe the country is headed
for a recession, if not already in one.
