   The new president is no fashion plate, but
Lech Walesa knows what color he doesn't like: red.
   Avoiding that Communist favorite was Walesa's only request to
his new clothing coordinator, designer Krystyna Wasylkowska of the
Polish fashion house Moda Polska.
   Otherwise, Walesa - who by reporters' count had at most three
suits as he led Poland out of Communism, met foreign leaders and
spoke to governments worldwide - has turned his wardrobe entirely
over to Ms. Wasylkowska.
   ``He is an easy customer. He told me he would leave everything
to me,'' the designer told the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   Moda Polska, a state-owned clothing enterprise, was chosen to
outfit the president by his staff, which rejected a German firm's
offer in favor of the ``Made in Poland'' label, Ms. Wasylkowska was
quoted as saying.
   For her part, Walesa's wife, Danuta, rarely in the spotlight
during her husband's decade of activism, made a fashionable entry
as First Lady at her husband's inauguration Saturday.
   She wore an elegant black suit and a dramatic netting-adorned
pillbox hat.

<HEAD>Nancy Cruzan Case: A Minister's Dilemma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOUNT VERNON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven days ago, the Rev. Ted Coleman
thought removing Nancy Cruzan's feeding tube was immoral and cruel.
   But the chaplain at the clinic where the woman lies after nearly
eight years in a persistent vegetative state told his congregation
Sunday that now he's not so sure her parents were wrong to fight
for her right to die.
   ``I'm struggling like I've never had to struggle before,''
Coleman told parishioners at the First Christian Church (Disciples
of Christ).
   Coleman, 51, doubles as chaplain at the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center, where Ms. Cruzan is in a vegetative state doctors say is
irreversible. The 33-year-old woman remained in deteriorating
condition late Sunday.
   A judge on Dec. 14 gave Ms. Cruzan's parents permission to have
the tube removed.
   Until then, Coleman said he firmly believed that ending Ms.
Cruzan's life was wrong.
   He'd said he never met Joe and Joyce Cruzan until that day, but
it didn't matter because he believed ending their daughter's life
was unconscionable, even if there was no hope of her recovering.
   As recently as Tuesday, when 19 people were arrested for
bursting into the hospital and trying to reach Ms. Cruzan's room to
reconnect her feeding tube, Coleman admitted he sympathized with
the anti-euthanasia demonstrators.
   But after getting to know the Cruzans through daily visits and
giving more thought to the right-to-die issue, Coleman said he's
re-evaluated his position.
   ``As a minister of the Gospel, I've studied and been taught that
certain truths are always black or white,'' he said. ``As I deal
more with this issue, I'm not sure it is black or white.''
   When he kisses his two teen-age daughters good night, Coleman
said, he puts himself in the Cruzans' position.
   ``I can't help but ask myself, `What would I do if one of them
suddenly was in the same medical condition as Nancy?' Sometimes I
think we are too quick to judge others, when we don't know what we
would do in the same situation.''
   Coleman said he now believes the round-the-clock presence of
demonstrators outside the clinic does little more than further
burden and irritate the Cruzans.
   ``They are caring people who have struggled with this issue for
a long time. They deserve to have time to grieve the loss of their
daughter, which they haven't had,'' Coleman said.
   Snow, subzero cold and legal setbacks in their attempts to force
the state to resume feeding Ms. Cruzan have reduced the number of
full-time demonstrators at the hospital from about 15 to just three
Sunday night.
   But the strain on the Cruzans, which began with Nancy's car
crash on Jan. 11, 1983, is becoming apparent as her death nears.
   On Sunday, Joe Cruzan stepped past police officers who screen
visitors at the hospital entrance and went onto the lawn to tear up
a banner reading ``Joe, Please Feed Nancy.''
   ``I got your message, and I got your sign,'' he shouted.
   Coleman asked the 280 members of his congregation to pray for
the Cruzan family, asking either for a miracle or a ``painless and
swift'' death for Nancy.
   He also asked them to pray for him.
   ``I'm struggling mightily with this issue, and I know others are
struggling too,'' he said.

<HEAD>South Korea Hopes Gains Are Mutual In Soviet Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With exports to the United States and
other parts of the world sagging, South Korea is eager to do
business with the Soviet Union.
   Evidence of South Korean presence is visible almost as soon as a
visitor steps off the plane at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow. The
1,500 baggage carts are emblazoned with signs advertising Samsung,
a Korean conglomerate.
   Visitors can rent Hyundai automobiles made in South Korea, buy
Korean-made fur coats and see Korean-sponsored quiz shows on
television. They pass billboards advertising Korean companies,
placed strategically near the Kremlin.
   South Korea has washing machines, refrigerators, televisions,
videos, sewing machines, soap, shoes, electronics and dozens of
other moderately priced consumer goods the Soviets need. South
Koreans hope the Soviets have the kinds of advanced technology they
need and can't get elsewhere.
   Experts say the ultimate goal is the transfer from Moscow to
Seoul of technologies that either the United States and Japan will
nt provide or are too expensive in the West.
   Among them are core technology in lasers, space, biotechnology,
nuclear fusion, electronics and composite and super-hard materials
with applications that could range from a new kind of automobile
brake to gene therapy.
   Does the Soviet Union have usable high technologies? No one
seems to know. ``The Koreans are still looking at the wares,
searching for nuggets,'' a Western expert said.
   Analyst Kim Byong-kuk said: ``The cardinal inducement for
Korean-Soviet economic cooperation stems from the fact that both
nations are in a position to offer what the other party needs
most.''
   President Roh Tae-woo visited Moscow two weeks ago, less than
three months after the governments established normal relations. He
said his summit talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev heralded a new era
of mutual prosperity.
   ``The Soviet Union has advanced science and technology we need,
and we can provide consumer goods and facilities,'' Roh said.
   North Korea assailed the visit and indirectly criticized its
Soviet allies, but with little effect.
   A day after Roh returned, the Science and Technology Ministry
announced that 281 Soviet technologies were expected to be
transferred for commercial application including those for nuclear
fusion and fast breeder reactors.
   In return, South Korea is to provide production technology for
consumer goods.
   The Bank of Korea said $9.1 million had been approved for
investment by mid-December. In January, South Korea is expected to
complete an economic cooperation and loan package said to total $3
billion.
   Trade between the two countries doubled in 1989 to $600 million.
It is expected to exceed $1 billion in 1990 and South Korean
officials have predicted levels of up to $10 billion within five
years.
   After years of selling copycat items at low prices because of
low wages, the South Koreans are trying to catch up
technologically. To compete in an atmosphere of rising labor and
production costs, they need to make more advanced products of
higher quality.
   As if to emphasize the point, the last stop Roh made in the
Soviet Union was the Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute in Leningrad.
   ``Japan is making a lot of money by dominating the world's
semiconductor market,'' he was quoted as saying. ``If we combine
Soviet advanced technology and South Korea's application know how,
we can split the profit.''
   Many South Koreans feel the Soviets are using this country as
bait to lure a bigger fish, Japan, into committing billions of
dollars to long-range development of Soviet natural resources.
   ``High technology is especially urgent for South Korea,'' said
Dr. Rhee Sang-woo, a specialist in public policy, but ``for Japan,
it's meaningless. They don't need Soviet high technology. South
Korea is bait to fish Japan.''
   Japan has held off because of a territorial dispute over a group
of islands and because it views investment in the Soviet Union as
risky. Observers feel development of close commercial relations
between Moscow and Seoul will make Japanese businessmen uneasy and
more susceptible to Soviet advances.
   Among the technologies South Korea wants most are those for high
definition television, which displays pictures that are stunning in
color and detail.
   The Soviet Union is said to possess the technology, but has been
unable to build and market it. High definition television already
is a multibillion-dollar industry in Japan and is beginning to
catch on in the United States.
   Daewoo Corp., parent company of the giant Daewoo Group
conglomerate, recently signed two joint-venture contracts with the
Soviets with the aim of commercializing new Soviet technologies.
   The contracts are with the Ioffe institute and the Soviet
Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry. The technologies include
those applicable to high definition television, new methods to cast
aluminum, nuclear membranes for making work spaces germ-free and
technology for treating industrial waste, Daewoo said.

<HEAD>New D.C. Mayor Confronts Drugs, Deficits, Infant Mortality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From a terrifying murder rate to appalling
infant mortality, Sharon Pratt Dixon will confront problems that
would daunt the nation's savviest public official when she becomes
mayor of the nation's capital.
   But the woman who takes office Jan. 2, is the very opposite of
an experienced government bureaucrat. And her response to the
challenges will set the tone for life in a city anxious for an end
to turbulence after outgoing Mayor Marion Barry's highly publicized
drug and legal difficulties.
   Dixon, 46 and a former utility company executive, swept to
victory in November in her first-ever political campaign. She had
been the first candidate to call on Barry to give up his job, and
campaigned on a pledge to root out waste and corruption in city
government.
   Last month, a blue-ribbon panel that examined the city's
deteriorating financial situation recommended that 6,000 government
jobs be eliminated.
   So far, she isn't saying how she'll proceed when she becomes the
capital city's first woman mayor.
   She won't have long to get going - on that problem or any other.
   The police force continues to grow toward a record level of
5,100 officers, yet a record 471 people have been murdered this
year, many of them the result of the city's notorious drug trade.
Homelessness; public school difficulties; chronic prison crowding;
an infant mortality rate higher than many Third World countries:
these will be Dixon's to deal with, as well.
   Solving these dilemmas will take money, and the nation's capital
city is broke. This year's deficit of $100 million could double in
the next fiscal year.
   Amidst the gloom are some signs of hope.
   The departure of Barry - who is appealing his cocaine possession
conviction and six-month prison sentence - should mean a new spirit
of goodwill among the city, the Congress and the Bush
administration.
   The annual payment made to the city in lieu of taxes lost on
federally-owned property has been frozen at $430.5 million for five
years in a visible symbol of congressional dissatisfaction with
Barry.
   After a meeting with Dixon last month, House Speaker Thomas
Foley said the payment may soon be increased. Earlier this month,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner praised Dixon while
awarding the city $19 million in federal highway funds. Barry was
nowhere to be seen.
   Dixon's no-frills style differs sharply from that of Barry, who
made no secret of his love for limousines, police escorts and other
trappings of power.
   Last month, the mayor-elect said she would all but eliminate the
24-member, round-the-clock police security detail that accompanied
Barry to all his official and private functions. ``That's just not
my style - I'm not comfortable with it,'' Dixon said.
   Ms. Dixon, divorced and the mother of two grown daughters, has
had a career as an electric company executive. She also has served
two terms as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.
   But her profile in national Democratic politics aside, she has
scant experience in local government affairs.
   The long-awaited study of the city's bureaucracy gives Dixon -
who has promised to pare 2,000 workers from the city payroll - even
greater momentum to make broad cuts in the 48,000 member district
work force.
   ``It certainly underscores the need to clean out some of the
mid-level bloat,'' Dixon says. ``The need for streamlining, for
better accountability, it is all there.''
   Eliminating police jobs could prove unpopular on Capitol Hill,
where lawmakers critical of city anti-crime efforts are nonetheless
anxious to see Dixon take over from Barry.
   Other pressing problems have so far defied solution. Among them,
the city's 1989 infant mortality rate of 23.1 per 1,000 live births
was higher than the rate in Malaysia, Mauritius, and Uruguay.
   And even before Dixon can take office, the sniping has begun.
   Dixon promises to ``hit the ground running,'' but so far has
failed to name any key lieutenants. Current and former city
officials assisting her transition are complaining that the passage
is marked by a lack of direction from Dixon herself and her failure
to list any top priorities for her new administration.
   To make matters worse, Dixon is already dealing with government
infighting. City Council Chairman John Wilson has made no secret of
his desire to wield more power. An advisory group he assembled to
help him restructure his new job resembles, in the words of WAMU-FM
political commentator Mark Plotkin, ``a 1994 mayoral exploratory
committee.''

<HEAD>Like Presidents Before Him, Bush Forgoes Raise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal workers everywhere, from Vice
President Dan Quayle to the troops in the Persian Gulf to the
groundskeepers at the White House, will pocket fatter paychecks in
the new year.
   There's one exception to the rule: President Bush.
   His salary stays frozen at $200,000, right where it has been for
the last 22 years and five presidencies.
   For several million rank-and-file workers, both military and
civilian, the pay raise is a flat 4.1 percent.
   But thousands of top federal executives are getting big raises,
on the scale of $20,000 to $30,000, thanks to a 1989 law that
lifted the lid on salaries.
   Quayle's pay will rocket from $124,000 to $160,600. Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Speaker Thomas Foley get the same 29
percent increase. Cabinet salaries swell from $107,300 to $138,900.
   The Constitution precludes raising - or lowering - the
president's pay during his term, so Bush has no immediate prospects
for a salary hike.
   Bush has ``no complaints,'' says White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``He thinks his pay is adequate. The presidency's still a pretty
good job,'' quipped the press secretary.
   No one disputes that, but a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed
government salaries two years ago did recommend boosting the
president's salary in 1993 to $350,000 plus a cost-of-living
adjustment. Congress ignored the recommendation.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader begs to differ.
   Nader, who lobbied strenuously to block the pay hikes, believes
Bush should revoke the 1991 raises and cut his own pay ``as a
gesture to the American people at a time of considerable sacrifice
for them.''
   ``At a time of deficit and recession, he should set an
example,'' Nader said.
   Presidents have only gotten four pay increases in history.
   Experts agree that whatever the salary, the presidency is rich
in perquisites, from a mansion staffed with servants to the
limousines, helicopters and Boeing 747 jumbo jet at his beck and
call.
   ``The president probably gets the equivalent of another $500,000
in perks,'' said lawyer Lloyd N. Cutler, who chaired the 1989
Quadrennial Pay Commission. ``The perks make up for an awful lot of
salary,''
   Still, Cutler said the president's salary is ``way below what it
ought to be.''
   If Bush were paid commensurate to corporate chiefs and top
lawyers, ``I suppose you'd be over $1 million,'' said Cutler.
``With present budget constraints, this president would never ask
for a raise if he were going to run again.''
   The $200,000 ``was a darn good salary'' back in 1969, said Fred
Hohlweg, a pay expert with the Office of Personnel Management.
``He's doing worse and worse.''
   The Consumer Price Index has increased nearly fourfold since
1969. If the president's pay had kept pace, Bush would be drawing
$730,000 a year. Put another way, $200,000 today barely buys what
$55,000 did back in 1969.
   Walton R. Winder, a vice president of Towers Perrin Co. in New
York, said the chief executives of the nation's 100 largest
corporations averaged $1.3 million in cash compensation last year,
more than five times their 1969 level.
   Even top university and non-profit organization jobs pay more
than the presidency, Winder said.
   Vice presidents, on the other hand, have never had it so good.
   When the first Congress fixed George Washington's salary at the
then kingly sum of $25,000 in 1789, the lawmakers allotted $5,000
for Vice President John Adams - 20 percent of the president's
salary.
   When Bush became vice president, he was earning less than 40
percent of Ronald Reagan's salary.
   But by the time Bush turned the job over to Dan Quayle, it paid
$115,000. Quayle got a $9,000 raise earlier this year and starting
Jan. 1 he will be earning barely 20 percent less than Bush.
   Perhaps because the vice president's salary traditionally is
linked to that paid the speaker of the house, Congress has shown
less reluctance to vote raises for the president's stand-by than
the president himself. Vice presidential salaries have been raised
18 times - and cut on four occasions in the Depression and in 1874.
   The first 17 presidents got the same $25,000 salary that
Washington commanded.
   Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president, got a $25,000 raise that
doubled the salary to $50,000 in 1873 for his second term.
   In 1909, Congress forked over another $25,000, boosting the
salary to $75,000 when William Howard Taft took office as the 27th
president. There it remained for the next 40 years.
   In 1930, when Babe Ruth signed a stratospheric $80,000-a-year
contract with the New York Yankees, scribes asked the slugger if he
thought he should be paid more than President Herbert Hoover.
   ``Why not? I had a better year than he did,'' the Babe replied.
   Harry Truman, the 33rd president, became the first
$100,000-a-year president in 1949. Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson got by on the same amount, but the
salary doubled to $200,000 in 1969 when Richard M. Nixon took the
oath of office.
   ``Congress did that without any by-your-leave from either the
outgoing or the incoming president, and it was done in a matter of
days,'' said Sharon S. Gressle, who tracks government salaries for
the Congressional Research Service.
   Quayle, members of Congress, judges and others at the top of the
salary pyramid now are eligible for cost-of-living increases, up to
5 percent a year.
   If they got the maximum increase for the next five years, then
on Jan. 1, 1996, the vice president would be making $205,000, or
$5,000 more than the president, Gressle said.

<TEXT>
   'Tis the night before Christmas, and all
through the House and Senate, lots of creatures are stirring.
Especially mice.
   The Capitol is a building alive.
   Although the exact number is a national secret (or it would be,
if it could be determined), there is a battalion of mice living in
the historic structure.
   Occasionally they make themselves known, including memorable
sightings on the House floor and in Speaker Thomas Foley's old
office. Perhaps when no one is around but the guards, they frolic
openly.
   But beyond the squeaks of its diminutive year-round residents,
the Capitol itself speaks.
   Sometimes, it speaks of fear.
   Metal detectors and x-ray machines erected at nearly every
entrance tell of a decade of increasing unease about terrorism.
   Hidden cameras watch the corridors.
   A careful observer can rap steel inserts in the seatbacks of the
House chamber and find a patch in the Republican leader's desk
where a bullet from a Puerto Rican nationalist's gun penetrated
four decades ago.
   On the Senate side, a beefed-up wall stands behind the Ohio
Clock, which was restored after a 1983 bomb explosion shattered its
delicate wooden housing.
   Sometimes, it speaks of vanity.
   For example, lawmakers since World War II have taken to naming
the rooms after themselves.
   Historical greats such as Daniel Webster and Henry Clay command
no territory beyond their statues. But Speaker Foley holds meetings
in the Thomas P. O'Neill Room, named after the Massachusetts
Democrat and former speaker.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, works in a
suite named after his predecessor, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. And
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., labors in the Howard Baker
rooms, named for his predecessor.
   The rush for recognition in the Senate has so gobbled up real
estate that some worry there may soon be no good rooms left to
name. Already, a Christmas Eve visitor would find telephone booths
in the Democratic cloakroom named for senior senators.
   Not only the elected officials have egos. Architect of the
Capitol George White had his portrait added to the collection
painted on the arched ceilings in the House wing.
   The building on the hill also speaks of power.
   A sign on the door tells visitors that the House Document Room
is no longer adjacent to beautiful Statuary Hall. The repository of
bills and reports has been moved out of the building so that
Speaker Foley can add to his ever-expanding kingdom.
   Nameplates on doors throughout the building indicate the offices
of the most powerful and senior chairman, names like Rostenkowski,
Whitten, and Byrd.
   Doors with no names also tell tales to those who know. Many are
senators' hideaways, private retreats only steps from the Senate
floor where lawmakers can work undisturbed, hold secret meetings or
just catch a nap during a late session.
   All around, the building speaks of age and decay.
   Scaffolds abound during the congressional recess as expert
plasterers and painters repair the wounds time and nature have
inflicted on the structure.
   And at the top of the dome, the statue Freedom is crying for its
upcoming restoration after a century of rain, wind and lightning.
   And the Capitol speaks of hope, both whimsical and not.
   The shoes of the statue of Will Rogers shine from people
touching them for luck. ``I do it more in election years,'' says
Rep. Mike Snyder, D-Okla.
   Nearby, in the Rotunda, among the grandiose paintings and
statuary, is a plain black and white flag with a symbol of a
captive soldier and the letters ``POW-MIA.''
   It always speaks. It's just easier to hear during the holidays.

   Richard Kimball envisions a future in which
voters reject television campaign commercials and select national
leaders as they would prospective employees - by reviewing their
resumes.
   He has taken a leave from his job to try to make those resumes
and more available to voters by telephone in 1992 on every
candidate running for national office from every state.
   ``The people in Congress are the hired help,'' said Kimball.
``We're saying if you, the voter, are the employer, what do you
need to know?''
   Kimball, a political science teacher and former Arizona state
senator, is directing the Center for National Independence in
Politics, a non-profit organization whose honorary co-chairmen are
former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
   Kimball says that by 1992, the center will offer a telephone
number providing voters:
   -Basic personal information on each candidate.
   -Names of people and organizations who have contributed to the
campaign.
   -Ratings of the candidate by special interest groups ranging
from the American Conservative Union to the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Kimball worked briefly many years ago in the Washington offices
of Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.
   After serving in the Arizona Senate for four years and as
chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates
utilities, Kimball ran for the U.S. Senate in 1986, but lost to
Sen. John McCain, a Republican.
   Melodee Jackson, Arizona Democratic Party executive director,
said some people questioned Kimball's decision to run a longshot
campaign against McCain when he had a secure and successful career
with the regulatory commission.
   ``He probably would have been re-elected (to the commission) for
as long as he wanted to run,'' she said.
   Kimball is passionate about politics and unconventional in that
``he doesn't hold up his finger to see which way the wind is
blowing before he takes a position,'' Jackson said.
   Kimball said his Senate race against the well-financed McCain
campaign showed him the importance of television in modern
elections, but the image-making quality of TV commercials sickened
him.
   The ads used nowadays ``are disastrous in a democracy,'' said
Kimball. ``How can you possibly expect people to govern themselves
if what is put before them is not a discussion of public policy?
   ``People cannot deal with the manipulation. They're being buried
by meaningless information.''
   He said campaign finance laws can be changed, but voters won't
be better off if the money available is still used to build images
irrelevant to issues facing the country.
   The idea for the telephone service came while Kimball was
talking to former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who campaigned for
him in 1986, and former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., who is a
lifelong acquaintance.
   The three of them contacted other political figures to serve on
the center's board of directors. The 35-member board is equally
divided among Democrats and Republicans and includes others
unaffiliated with a party.
   Last election, the center experimented with its concept in
Nebraska and North Carolina.
   ``We got about 6,000 calls,'' said Kimball. Since the center did
no paid advertising, the calls were generated by news stories and
word of mouth after one press conference.
   When people called the 800-number, they got an operator with
access to a computer holding the information on each candidate.
   Kimball said about 50 percent of the callers wanted voting
record ratings and 25 percent sought campaign finance information,
but operators also got calls seeking a range of biographical
details.
   Kimball says the center needs at least $500,000 to run a
nationwide telephone service using toll-free numbers, but he said a
self-financing 900-number system would be used if sufficient funds
aren't raised. It would cost $3 a call.
   Seed money for the project, which operated on a budget of
$290,000 last year, came from $35 memberships obtained through
direct mail solicitations and a total of about $100,000 from five
foundations: Carnegie, Deer Creek Foundation, Mary Reynolds
Babcock, Benton Foundation and ARCA.
   The center is based in Tucson, Ariz., and staffed predominantly
by volunteers, including Kimball. The board members are unpaid and
include Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa; Peggy Lampl, former president of
the League of Women Voters; Kenneth Adelman, former head of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; 1984 Democratic vice
presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro; Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.;
John Echohawk, head Native Americans Rights Fund; former Sen.
George McGovern, D-S.D.; and Irene Natividad, former president of
the National Women's Political Caucus.

<HEAD>Cut Off Aid If Repression Occurs, Majority Leader Says</HEAD>

   The Bush administration has banked too heavily
on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's ability to reform his
troubled nation, according to a key Senate leader and others.
   ``Gorbachev is, of course, an historic figure - effected change
in the world more than any other person in recent years,'' Senate
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said Sunday.
   But Mitchell said Gorbachev is not going to rule forever in a
country where, he said, the central government appears to be
leaning towards a crackdown on the rebellious republics.
   ``I think we should be supportive, we certainly should be
grateful for all he has done, but I think our policy ought not to
be as highly personal as it has been,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press.''
   Of the situation in the Soviet Union, Mitchell said, ``I think
the signs coming out of there are ominous in the last few days and
the possibilities of that (a crackdown) occurring, I think are
increasing.''
   If a crackdown occurs, he said the United States should cut off
any aid to the Soviet Union.
   ``I think we ought to have substantial aid unless and until the
crackdown occurs and if it does, then ... we surely should not be
providing aid at that time,'' he said.
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under former
President Carter, agreed with Mitchell's pessimistic assessment of
the future of the Soviet Union, at least in the near term.
   ``I think the coalition ... is beginning to break up,'' he said.
``The options are becoming more extreme and I am afraid there is,
indeed, a drift toward the hard line with the KGB and the army now
being the dominant political institutions,'' he said.
   Moreover, the United States has ``overly identified the future
of the Soviet Union with Gorbachev,'' he said.
   While Gorbachev deserves the administration's support and
admiration, he has proved intransigent in his opposition to
collective ownership of land and has said he will never give up on
the idea of a multinational state run by the Russians, Brzezinski
said.
   ``These two things are no longer viable,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, President Bush outlined a varied economic
aid package that included technical and medical assistance and
support for the Soviets to affiliate with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   Bush announced his plan before Eduard Shevardnadze resigned as
foreign minister, contending the Soviet Union was moving towards a
dictatorship. On Saturday, the head of the KGB, Vladimir Kryuchkov,
warned of a possibility of bloodshed to restore order to the
rebellious republics.
   Bush has said the United States is concerned about
Shevardnadze's resignation. ``Obviously people are ... wondering
about the concerns raised by Mr. Shevardnadze,'' he said. ``Life
goes on,'' he added.
   Former Secretary of State George Shultz, appearing on ABC-TV's
``This Week With David Brinkley,'' said he had a hard time
speculating what would happen in the Soviet Union.
   For the moment, he said the Bush administration continue to
engage the Soviet Union on key points, such as reducing nuclear
arms and trying to dampen regional conflicts.

<HEAD>Christmas Spirit Takes True Grit in Desert Shield</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every soldier in the U.S. Army's
1st Cavalry Division is getting a gift package for Christmas - even
if it's only a pair of government-issue green socks.
   Services to mark the birth of Jesus and secular yuletide symbols
such as Christmas trees are being hidden behind closed tent flaps
so as not to offend the Moslem hosts of the Desert Shield
deployment.
   Carols are sung in combat boots and Christmas spirit is as hard
to find as reindeer in a camel herd, so troops fight to keep their
minds off the thousands of miles separating them from loved ones.
   ``If I start thinking about it, I get lonely,'' said Army Spec.
Robert Dennett, 29, of Rutherford, Texas, whose three kids will be
opening Christmas gifts without him. ``My wife said she was going
to save a bunch of presents 'til I got back and do Christmas all
over again.''
   Christmas was intentionally subdued in Saudi Arabia, where
strict Islamic codes ban the worship of other religions. That means
songs like ``White Christmas'' are preferred over ``Silent Night''
on the military radio stations.
   The only celebrity to visit is Bob Hope, the war-horse
troubadour who first entertained U.S. combat troops 50 years ago.
   Meals and mail provided some Christmas cheer.
   Military cooks prepared 150,000 pounds of rolled turkey and
4,000 whole turkeys for the 280,000 U.S. service members brought to
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The goal is
to get a hot Christmas dinner to all the troops, even those closest
to the Kuwaiti border.
   The main lifeline to home is the average of 400 tons of mail a
day, hauled in on at least five planeloads.
   Inmates at Szabo Correctional Services at Dublin, Calif., sent
boxes of cookies to officers. Josefina Ceja of Pomona, Calif.,
dispatched homemade tortillas to her son. Another mom sent a
finger-painting set.
   ``Even the camels see the mail trucks coming because the troops
feed them cookies,'' said Major Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, head
of logistics for the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam.
``Like other creatures of the wild, they learn real fast the GIs
will feed them.''
   So many packages addressed to ``any soldier'' were received that
each of the 20,000 soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division can expect
to get a Christmas package. Those who don't get a civilian gift can
expect to get military T-shirts, underwear and socks.
   ``It might be a pair of green socks. It might be a Frisbee. But
we've got one gift for every soldier,'' said Maj. Steve Stacey, the
division's personnel officer.
   He also delivered the 1st Cavalry's message to the folks on the
home front: ``Although we're homesick and we miss you, we're with
you in spirit. We can't send any presents, so we send your our
love.''
   Midnight Mass has its own subtleties in the sand. Some services
were to be moved up to dusk. That way, troops wouldn't violate the
military ban on lights in the desert night.
   Lt. Theodore Borger, one of three Roman Catholic priests tending
to the spiritual needs of the 1st Marine Division, was planning
about 20 services.
   He was going to break out his special folding combat altar, but
was not going to deliver any special message.
   ``There will be others that will talk to them about the evil or
war. That's not my job,'' said Borger, 35, of Ottumwa, Iowa.
   Meanwhile, troops entertained themselves by singing lyrics to
their favorite holiday tunes. The Marine version of ``Jingle
Bells'' went like this:
   ``Dashing through the sand, with an M16 in hand, terrorizing the
land, looking for Hussein. Treads on tracks will ring, giving
troops a fright, opens up the door, we get out and fight.''
   A few Marines stuck up stockings in their tents, and Cpl.
Vincent Buck, 21 decorated the radiator grill of his truck with a
plastic holy wreath his mother sent from Santa Barbara, Calif.
   His dad sent mistletoe.
   There were not to be any Christmas spirits of the alcoholic
variety because of Saudi Arabia's strict ban on booze. So Maj. John
Porter of the Army's Battle Command Training Program made other
plans.
   ``We're going to have a party on the beach,'' said Porter, 38,
of Leavenworth, Kan. ``We're going to have near-beer, near-wine,
and the next morning we're going to wake up with near hangovers.''
   Some combat training has been scheduled for Christmas Day, but
most troops will have a light day.
   ``It's just another day in the desert,'' said Pfc. Mark Idleman,
19, of Wilson, Okla., a tank crewman with the 32nd Armored Regiment
of the 1st Cavalry Division.
   ``Christmas is a bad topic over here,'' said Lt. Tyler Randolph,
24, of MacLean, Va., who serves in one of the units of the Army's
18th Airborne Corps. ``It just makes you miss everybody more.''

   Jail cells for surrendering cocaine
smugglers will be endowed with kitchenettes, private baths and
individual patios, a Bogota newspaper reports.
   Citing Justice Ministry official John Jairo Mejia, El Tiempo
said in Sunday's editions that each drug trafficker's cell will
contain 290 square feet. A common outdoor ``green zone'' will
surround the prisoners.
   Colombian drug bosses have said between 200 and 300 traffickers
are willing to surrender to authorities in exchange for lenient
judicial treatment.
   Besides an end to extraditions to the United States, the
traffickers are demanding specially prepared jails protected by the
army and police.
   Five traffickers have already turned themselves in, including
Fabio Ochoa, the youngest of three brothers who help run the
Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Mejia denied reports that traffickers would be given luxury jail
cells.
   ``We are not talking about suites,'' El Tiempo quoted him as
saying.

   President Bush, in a Christmas message to U.S.
troops worldwide, reiterated his vow to try to bring those serving
in the Persian Gulf home without a shot fired and declared ``the
world is behind you.''
   ``In this season of peace it is your commitment and your courage
that makes peace possible,'' Bush said in the taped message that
was being broadcast on armed services radio beginning at noon
today.
   ``Back home, some talk of the cost of war. But it is you who
understand the price of peace,'' he said.
   Bush, who with his wife Barbara spent Thanksgiving visiting
troops in Saudi Arabia, recalled that visit in his talk.
   ``And when I got back, I spoke to the American people, told them
of your bravery and reminded them why we're there.''
   Bush was spending the Christmas holidays with members of his
family at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.
   ``We're in the Gulf because the world must not reward
aggression, because our vital interests are at stake, and because
of the brutality and danger of Saddam Hussein,'' Bush said.
   With the United Nations-set deadline of Jan. 15 for Saddam
Hussein to leave Kuwait just weeks away, Bush said, ``When you come
home, and we hope it's soon, you'll be welcomed as what you are:
all-American heroes.''
   Bush reiterated his vow to ``do my level best to bring you home
without a shot being fired.''
   ``The sacrifices you make will never be forgotten. America is
behind you. The world is behind you and history is behind you.''
   The president concluded the message with a story about a
military couple both serving in the Gulf.
   ``I think of Lt. Mary Danko, the flight nurse who volunteered
for Saudi Arabia. Her husband, a C-130 navigator, was already
flying in support of Desert Shield. And when asked if leaving their
baby with relatives was a hard thing to do, Mary said: 'it's the
right thing to do. We're needed.'''
   ``And when asked, `now what about the kid?' Mary explained,
`we're doing it for the kid.'''
   ``It's distant in time, but close within our hearts because on
this Christmas Day, hour by hour, hand in hand, Americans will send
their prayers eastward across the ocean and halfway across the
world not only to the town of Bethlehem but to the sands and shores
where you stand in harm's way,'' Bush said.

   What makes former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson
angry?
   Paying taxes and getting pulled over by the police.
   ``I hate taxes,'' he told Spin magazine in its January 1991
issue. ``More than anything. They can take your money and all that
stuff. But you know what they do? They humiliate you. Like, I can
handle being broke, but it's just the fact of being humiliated.''
   As for the police, Tyson, 24, hates officers who tell him, ``You
might have a lot of money, but I'm the boss here.''
   ``You know, if you're going to give me a ticket, give me a
ticket,'' Tyson said. ``Don't give me a ticket and a lecture.''
   Tyson lost the heavyweight title in February to Buster Douglas.

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - James Brown will perform in public for the
first time since his imprisonment two years ago when he entertains
soldiers at Fort Jackson on Christmas.
   The soul singer, who began a four-day furlough Sunday, is
scheduled to entertain nearly 10,000 soldiers whose holiday leaves
were canceled because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Corrections Commissioner Parker Evatt gave the ``Godfather of
Soul'' permission to perform.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault,
failure to stop for police and weapons violations stemming from a
high-speed chase through Georgia and South Carolina. He was
imprisoned in December 1988 and is eligible for parole March 8.
   In April, Brown, who had several previous arrests on drug
charges, transferred to a work-release program in Aiken where he
counsels youths about drug abuse. He stays at a minimum-security
facility near Aiken at night.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Less than a year after Deborah Norville
succeeded Jane Pauley on NBC's ``Today'' show, network sources are
speculating that national correspondent Katie Couric will replace
her.
   Don Browne, executive vice president of NBC News, denies the
rumors, saying it's too soon after Ms. Norville's arrival to change
the show's co-hosts.
   Ms. Couric, 33, is scheduled to substitute for Ms. Norville when
she goes on maternity leave in the spring.
   ``She's no substitute - she's the successor,'' an unidentified
source told TV Guide in its Dec. 29 issue. ``Deborah's a bright
woman, but she doesn't come across that way on camera. She comes
across as plastic. Katie's real.''
   Ms. Couric, 33, joined NBC in 1989 as deputy Pentagon
correspondent. She has filled in several times as weekend anchor of
``NBC Nightly News'' and is scheduled to sub for ``Nightly News''
anchorman Tom Brokaw on New Year's Eve.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Why did Francis Ford Coppola make ``The
Godfather, Part III''?
   ``For the same reasons I made the second one: it didn't go away,
and they basically promised me carte blanche,'' Coppola, 51, said
in Sunday's New York Times.
   ```The Godfather' became my claim to fame and my claim to be
able to continue making movies,'' he said.
   The first two ``Godfathers'' are the only movie and its sequel
to both win the Academy Award for best picture. Earlier this year
Coppola filed for bankruptcy and claims to owe up to $7 million
after such flops as ``The Cotton Club'' and ``One From the Heart.''
   ``I began to realize I didn't know who my audience was,'' he
told the Times. ``When I made a film, a ton of people didn't just
turn out to see it.''
   He said he began to realize that he was getting older and didn't
have a big audience anymore.
   ```The Godfather' always represented to me a chance to have a
big audience,'' he said.
   Coppola will earn $5 million for writing, directing and
producing the third chapter of the saga, plus a 15 percent share of
the gross.

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) - Steven Seagal and wife Kelly
LeBrock, stars of the action film ``Hard to Kill,'' have added a
vineyard to their Santa Ynez Valley ranch.
   The ranch is next to singer Michael Jackson's compound.
   The couple reportedly paid $1.7 million for a 100-acre parcel
that includes a 50-acre vineyard. The parcel adjoins Seagal's
80-acre ranch about 30 miles north of Santa Barbara.
   LeBrock, a former model, starred in the film ``Woman in Red''
and later appeared in ``Weird Science.''
   The couple bought the $2.8 million ranch in February.

<HEAD>Panel: National Policy Needed on Rural Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If people living in small towns and on small
farms are to be helped, a first step must be the formation of a
national policy on rural development, a presidential panel has
concluded.
   The National Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development
Policy said in a report sent to President Bush that the 1980s
``were much harder on many rural areas than on their urban
counterparts.''
   It cited economic crises in the agricultural and energy sectors,
along with ``tough new foreign competition in manufacturing,'' and
the relative disadvantage rural people have in obtaining adequate,
affordable health care, education and other vital services.
   Another factor noted by the report is the ``physical and social
isolation'' that separate rural America from the economic activity
of city life.
   The 15-member commission was appointed for two years by
President Reagan. It was authorized by the 1985 farm law, which is
now expiring.
   In its first report a year ago, the commission examined
agricultural policy issues and called for a more flexible,
market-oriented farm policy that would leave it up to farmers to
decide what crops to plant but still provide a ``safety net'' for
hard times.
   The 1990 farm law, which runs for five years after the current
one expires, provided some of that flexibility in its commodity
programs.
   In its final report, the commission focused on rural development
and some of the things local people and their governments ought to
be doing and thinking about.
   No massive federal aid package was called for. Rather, the
commission felt ``there are many problems in rural America, and
rural Americans are dealing with them, for their fate is in their
own hands.''
   Still, it said, the federal government has ``a critical support
role to play'' through many channels, including the use of existing
programs to help people and communities financially.
   ``When and if, a rural development policy is formulated, it will
be done in a different context from that of the past,'' the report
said. ``There is currently no defined rural development policy.
Instead, there exists a loose collection of individual programs.''
   Those partly resulted, the report said, from the division among
various federal agencies and among the federal, state and local
governments as to who had the responsibility for rural development.
   ``The federal government no longer plays the lead role, nor do
we expect it to,'' the commission reported.
   As many others have noted in recent years, the report made it
clear again that the problems of rural America are not homogeneous,
nor should they be solely equated with agriculture.
   ``Farming is still a vital part of the rural economy,'' the
report said. ``However, it directly employs less than 10 percent of
the rural work force. Mining, manufacturing, tourism, services and
government are also important industries in the rural economy.''
   Thus, the report added, ``Neither farm policy nor any other
single-issue policy can sufficiently address the needs of rural
America.''
   The commission said the ``first step toward helping rural
America is to articulate the goals for rural development policy,''
which, it said, are not solely economic in nature.
   Three principles were listed by the commission as guides for
rural development:
   -Rural areas and people must be economically self-reliant. In a
highly competitive, market-oriented world economy, self-reliance is
critical if the rural economy is to generate better jobs and income
for its residents.
   -Rural areas and people must be able to adapt. The world economy
has changed rapidly in recent years. Economic change is predicted
to become even more rapid. As a result, rural areas must develop
the ability to respond rapidly and effectively to changing market
conditions.
   -The rural physical and cultural environment should be
protected. The physical environment in rural areas and the cultural
heritage of rural people are valuable elements of national life and
livelihood, enjoyed by rural and urban residents alike, and deserve
protection.

<HEAD>Physicians Reassert That Chemical Weapons Were Used</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors who visited Kurdish refugees in late
1988 say their interviews and examinations convinced them Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons against his own
people.
   The physicians vociferously disputed a U.S. military study in
which the authors said there was no conclusive evidence that Iraq
gassed the Kurds in August and September 1988.
   ``We disagree very strongly,'' Dr. Howard Hu said of the
conclusions' reached by the military analysts who wrote a book
entitled ``Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East.'' The
book is primarily about the Iraq-Iran war, which ended in July
1988.
   Hu, who works at Harvard Medical School, said in a telephone
interview from Boston last week that he and two other doctors
traveled to Turkey in October 1988 to interview Kurds who had fled
Iraq after the alleged gas attacks.
   ``Was there any doubt that the Kurds had been gassed? No,'' Hu
said. The doctors are associated with Physicians For Human Rights,
a Boston-based group.
   They conducted in-depth videotaped interviews, examined alleged
victims and administered a 14-page questionnaire.
   They saw people who had skin burns that are characteristic of
chemical weapons burns, Hu said. Moreover, the reports from the
refugees were consistent.
   According to the testimony, the refugees saw bombing runs by
low-flying jets followed by the appearance of dark yellow clouds,
the sudden death of animals and humans and they experienced skin
blistering and severe irritation of the respiratory passages.
   Hu said the physicians did not see victims until nearly six
weeks after the attacks, however.
   ``The team could not determine the number of weapons used, the
scale of the attacks or the exact chemical composition of the
chemical agents,'' the doctors said.
   President Bush and others have used Iraq's alleged use of
chemical weapons against the Kurds as one of the justifications
stopping Saddam's aggression in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We've seen him use chemical weapons on his own people,'' Bush
said.
   But three analysts at the U.S. Army War College, whose book was
released last summer, raise questions about whether Saddam gassed
the Kurds in the fall of 1988.
   ``Having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us,
we find it impossible to confirm the State Department's claim that
gas was used in this instance,'' the authors wrote.
   ``To begin with, there were never any victims produced,'' they
said. The authors said the claims rest solely on the testimony of
refugees.
   The military authors did not visit Iraq, but looked at the
available reports. They speculated the Kurds might have been
injured by fuel air explosives instead of chemical weapons.
   Iraq denied at the time that it had gassed the Kurds and Turkish
officials said they too found no evidence of chemical weapons
injuries among the 60,000 Kurdish refugees.
   The authors said the conclusions in their book were their own
and did not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. military.

   After 168 years, Clement Moore's holiday poem
``The Night Before Christmas'' is solid as gold.
   But another of his creations, stately St. Peter's Episcopal
Church - for which he donated the land and design - is falling
apart.
   The church's patched, sagging roof probably couldn't support a
sleigh, let alone eight tiny reindeer, and its back wall bulges
like Santa's belly.
   ``There's a nice pile of stones out in the garden, and they've
all fallen out of the tower,'' said Ronald Kastner, who heads a
campaign to raise $3 million to repair the New York City landmark.
   The church's 130-foot bell tower is held together by steel
cables and masked by scaffolding. The tower's four-faced clock is
still and many of its stones have fallen and damaged the roof of
the nave. Windows that once boasted Tiffany-style stained glass are
boarded up.
   ``If we don't get the money,'' Kastner said, ``the tower will
fall onto the roof, and the roof will collapse, and the church will
close.''
   The Episcopal Diocese of New York gave the congregation $500,000
for repairs, but St. Peter's must raise the needed $3 million more
tself.
   The church is just one of Clement Clarke Moore's many
accomplishments. Born in 1779, he grew up on what was then his
family's rural estate. The area is now part of Manhattan's bustling
Chelsea neighborhood.
   In 1817 Moore donated the church property for the General
Theological Seminary, where he was a distinguished biblical scholar
for three decades. But he is remembered for ``An Account of a Visit
from St. Nicholas,'' also known as ``The Night Before Christmas.''
   He is said to have written the poem during a sleigh ride home
from Greenwich Village just before Christmas 1822, and to have read
it later to his six children. The piece was published a year later
in the Troy Sentinel and helped create St. Nick's image as a
``jolly old elf'' who looked more like a peddler than a children's
saint.
   But even as Moore's composition was rising to fame, its pastoral
setting was disappearing. In the 1820s, Chelsea was a
two-stagecoach trip from what was then the city and is now lower
Manhattan. But urbanites were moving steadily north to escape
disease and congestion.
   Around 1830 Moore decided to develop his farm, called Chelsea,
as a planned residential suburb. He sold the land in lots but
attached restrictions: no alleys, stables or factories, and no
building within 10 feet of the sidewalk. Moore the developer
transformed the landscape.
   Moore the poet, said historian Stephen Nissenbaum, helped
transform the nation's most widely observed holiday from ``a big
public occasion of rowdiness that lasted a month into a domestic
and private event within the family.''
   St. Peter's, with its tower and massively buttressed fieldstone
walls, became a focal point of the new neighborhood upon its
completion in 1838. Moore persuaded the congregation to accept a
neo-Gothic design inspired by his visits to English churches.
   By 1900 St. Peter's had about 500 parishioners, but membership
fell off as the building declined. It was closed temporarily in
1941 because of leaks in the roof.
   Over the years water continued to seep into the building,
loosening the mortar that held its stones and weakening the roof's
wooden framing.
   When the Rev. Wray MacKay took over as vicar, the church
averaged 10 people at Sunday services. But MacKay expanded the
congregation by increasing its services, including an AIDS
ministry, a food pantry, a program for the area's welfare hotel
residents and seasonal clothing drives. The church now has about
200 members.
   Moore died in 1863 and is buried 130 blocks uptown at Trinity
Cemetery. There, every Christmas Eve, carolers gather to sing the
praises of the city's most illustrious theologian, poet, developer
and architect.

<HEAD>General Assembly Mulls Expanded Session, Other Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the United Nations takes a stronger
role in world affairs, hopes are rising that the General Assembly
will become more efficient.
   The assembly, which ended its fall session last week, is to many
minds long overdue for reform.
   U.N. officials say the sessions are too short, that delegations
are dealing with too much nonessential business and a crush of
unnecessary paperwork.
   Though the 15-nation Security Council gets most of the limelight
at times of international crisis, the assembly, which includes all
159 member states, handles much of the organization's business.
   Timing is one important area.
   ``The timing of the U.N. General Assembly sessions was
originally determined with an eye to sailing schedules of the Queen
Mary,'' says the undersecretary-general for General Assembly
affairs, Ronald Spiers. ``It is now anachronistic.''
   The assembly still ends its fall meeting at the same time it did
at the United Nations' founding in 1945.
   ``What kind of General Assembly is this, which works for three
months and hibernates during the remaining nine months?'' asks
Guido de Marco, Malta's foreign minister, who is president of the
assembly this year.
   Spiers, the top American in the world body, says in a working
paper that the assembly ``needs to be viewed as a year-round body;
not in continuous meeting, but always available at call, not
constrained by out-of-date considerations.''
   De Marco says it should expand its calendar of meetings to focus
on foreign affairs in the September-December session, and add
assemblies on humanitarian affairs in March and an economic and
social session in May and June.
   Spiers advocates a general debate in November, with assembly
committees churning out the work of the body from January until the
following autumn.
   De Marco says thrice-yearly assemblies would enable the General
Assembly to focus its work on specific themes, attracting
like-minded government ministers concerned with those areas.
   This would pave the way for advances in social, economic and
humanitarian areas like the breakthroughs announced every fall in
the political sphere, when foreign ministers congregate in New York
every September.
   Among the resolutions remaining on the current agenda are
retreads of anti-apartheid declarations; redundant anti-Israel
measures; the report on the Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation
Decade; and measures to be taken against Nazi, fascist, and
neo-fascist activities.
   Spiers says that rather than carry over items from year to year,
they should die out and be approached anew each session.
   Each year, the whole assembly is obligated to devoting time to
such matters as appointment of new members of the Economic and
Social Council, auditor's reports on U.N. activities and a host of
other issues that could be disposed of at the subcommittee level,
or simply shelved.
   ``We don't need so many resolutions,'' said de Marco. ``We need
fewer, stronger, much more topical, and much more effective
resolutions.''
   Spiers and de Marco have been discussing their ideas separately
with committee chairman, U.N. officials and ambassadors.
   ``I've been finding very positive reaction among the
delegations,'' de Marco said.
   ``Wherever you meet delegations, you find that they are all
discussing this matter,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The yuletide holiday is such a big deal at West
High School that even the campus Christmas tree bursts into song.
   Students at the school normally provide the voices for their
Singing Christmas Tree, but this year, in honor of a half-century
of song, alumni from the classes of 1940 to 1989 joined in at two
weekend concerts.
   Mothers and fathers who memorized the verses to ``Silent Night''
and ``What Child is This?'' decades ago have been practicing for
the reprise since October, some alongside their daughters, sons,
nieces and nephews.
   Alumni representing every year of the tree's last 49 climbed the
risers on the 24-foot tree's steel framework to stand between the
branches and give the audience what looks like a Christmas tree
come to life.
   Nearly 200 alumni came back for the golden anniversary, the
first Singing Christmas Tree reunion since 1982, the school's
centennial year.
   Two former West High music directors - James Fluckey and John
Thorin - interrupted their retirements to help coordinate the
event.
   The tradition that has drawn them together this holiday season
started when West High teacher Willa Girault saw a singing
Christmas tree in Jackson, Miss. At her suggestion, it began in
1940 with 46 singers standing on wooden planks and holding tree
branches.
   ``It's our claim to fame,'' said Fluckey, who as music director
from 1955 to 1983 was in charge when the tree was flown to
Washington, D.C., for a 1972 performance in front of the White
House.
   ``Every year we'd get people who'd come and say they'd been to
the last 20 (concerts) and would never miss it,'' said Thorin, who
was at West High from 1970 to 1988.
   That tradition helped instill a lifelong love of music in Denver
resident Bill Keith, one of those back for the reunion.
   ``I think it all started here,'' said Keith, who was part of the
singing Christmas tree from 1943 to 1946.
   He attended the Juilliard School of Music on a scholarship after
graduation from West High and went on to teach music to high school
and college students.
   He was chosen by a panel of off-campus judges to be one of this
year's soloists, standing as a star near the top of the tree to
sing ``Silent Night.''
   In the old days, the student body voted to pick the tree's stars
and everybody wanted to be one, said Dale Lechuga of Greeley, one
of the stars in the late 1960s.
   ``There was nothing like it,'' she said.
   But there were pitfalls to standing near the top, so close to
the stage lights, said Janet Kitzman, who recalled that people
sometimes passed out up there. Kitzman, who graduated in 1952, is
singing with her son and two daughters this year.
   After 50 years, school officials acknowledge that enthusiasm for
the Singing Christmas Tree had dwindled in recent years.
   West High vocal-music diredtor Stephen Nye had commemorative
buttons and sweatshirts made up for 1990 to try to rekindle the old
spirit.
   ``Some of the glow had become tarnished,'' he said, ``so we're
trying to renew interest in it. ''

   In what they termed ``Operation
Yuletide Seizure,'' Communist rebels commandeered a dairy truck,
drove it to a Manila slum and handed out butter and cheese.
   The driver, Marcus Cordero, said three armed rebels flagged down
his truck in suburban Quezon city and ordered him to drive to the
Santa Mesa district.
   When they arrived, crowds of people from a squatters'
neighborhood had already lined up to receive about $1,140 worth of
butter and cheese.
   Residents of the neighborhood said the rebels tipped them off in
advance of Friday's incident to be ready for ``gift-giving.'' The
driver and a companion were released unharmed.
   In a statement to news organizations, the Alex Boncayao Brigade,
Manila wing of the communist New People's Army, claimed
responsibility for ``Operation Yuletide Seizure.''
   ``We undertook this action knowing that in these crises-ridden
times the Christmas season has brought nothing but bitterness and
additional pressure to the impoverished,'' the brigade said.
   The incident took place about 1{ miles from President Corazon
Aquino's office in the heart of the city.
   ``We stand by the legitimacy of our actions in the context of
the people's protracted war against imperialism and its local
minions, the bureaucrat capitalists,'' the brigade said.
   ``In this light, we hold that the Filipino people have the right
to seize from the profiteers the basic goods which are being denied
them.''

<HEAD>Vicks VapoRub Still Around, In Same Blue Jar, After 100 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHELTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred years after a pharmacist mixed
the first batch of Magic Croup Salve, later renamed Vicks VapoRub,
mothers are still tucking sick children into bed with a smear of
the gooey, aromatic concoction. One of America's most enduring cold
remedies, Vicks VapoRub still comes in the same distinctive blue
jar and still unclogs millions of stuffed noses with its
unmistakable vapors.
   It is little changed from the mix of menthol, camphor and
eucalyptus oil in a petrolatum base that Lunsford Richardson
created at his Greensboro, N.C., pharmacy in 1890.
   People under the weather with colds or the flu smear the
vaporizing salve on their chests or throats or dab it under their
noses for congestion relief. Generations of children recall it as
their mothers' favorite cure-all.
   In the early days, the Richardson family used coffee pots to
pour warm salve from large kettles into small jars. Vap-O-Rub
salesmen in a fleet of Ford Model T's traveled the countryside
searching for customers, tacking advertisements high up on barns
and trees with ladders provided for the job.
   Today, Vicks VapoRub is sold in more than 100 countries and is
made at more than a dozen plants around the world, from its
birthplace in North Carolina to factories in Mexico, India and
Australia.
   More than 1 million gallons of VapoRub are sold worldwide each
year, according to its maker, Richardson-Vicks Inc. Nearly 4 out of
5 Americans have used the product at one time and if every
container ever sold in the United States were laid side to side,
they could circle the globe twice.
   But as VapoRub enters its 100th year of fighting colds,
Richardson-Vicks is trying to stem a long sales decline by touting
it as something more than an old-fashioned remedy.
   U.S. sales of VapoRub began falling off in the late 1960s as
consumers began turning to new over-the-counter cold remedies once
available only by prescription, said Debra Bennetts, spokeswoman
for Richardson-Vicks at its Connecticut headquarters.
   In 1967, Richardson-Vicks introduced NyQuil, a nighttime cold
medicine that is now the company's top seller.
   VapoRub sales kept falling in the 1980s, dropping by nearly 10
percent in 1987-88 to a level maintained for the next two years,
Bennetts said.
   The company, acquired by The Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. in 1985, would
not provide actual sales figures. But sales appear to be better
this year thanks to an ad campaign aimed at older people unable to
take oral decongestants and cough remedies because they take
medication for heart disease or high blood pressure.
   ``Who cares if you've got high blood pressure and catch a
cold?'' the ad reads. ``We care.''
   VapoRub's early success was due as much to the marketing skills
of Richardson's son, Smith Richardson, as to its formula.
   The elder Lunsford Richardson formed the Vick Family Remedies
Co. in 1905 to manufacture and sell his line of 21 home remedies,
but his son convinced him to concentrate solely on the original
product. He renamed the salve VapoRub to dramatize its aromatic
characteristics.
   Sales reached $50,000 a year by 1910. The compny could afford
to buy a fleet of Model T Fords for its salesmen, who used ladders
provided by the firm to tack signs on barns and trees - an early
form of billboard advertising.
   Heading north, Richardson used a different marketing strategy:
newspaper ads resembling news articles that were accompanied by
coupons for free Vap-O-Rub Salve.
   The ads did not make any outrageous claims, like those for many
medical remedies of the day. The epidemic of Spanish influenza near
the end of World War I led to a nearly fivefold increase in sales
in three years.
   The company began expanding into foreign markets in the 1920s,
and by the end of the decade, was selling VapoRub in 60 nations. It
began to diversify in the 1930s, when it introduced its cough and
nose drops.

<TEXT>
   The alarm first sounded three years ago
when one of Brandeis University's dining halls started serving pork
and shellfish.
   Now the departure of the school's president has heightened
debate over the school's Jewish identity.
   One Jewish scholar argues that the changes made by President
Evelyn Handler symbolized something not only about the school but
about choices Jews have to make in American society.
   ``Brandeis University has been struggling with what could be
seen, in a complex way, as this temptation to assimilate,'' Gordon
Fellman, an associate professor of sociology, wrote in the
November-December edition of Tikkun, a liberal Jewish publication
based in Oakland, Calif.
   Founded in 1948, the year Israel became a state, Brandeis was
named after Justice Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jew on the U.S.
Supreme Court. The school's Jewish founders wanted it to be
nonsectarian, like Harvard and Notre Dame.
   The school today has an enrollment of 3,600 and an endowment of
$150 million. In recent years, the student body was estimated to be
65 percent Jewish; a school spokesman said he didn't know what that
percentage is now.
   Handler became the university's fifth president in 1983 and
encountered criticism in 1987 over changes in the dining hall and
the school's logo.
   The menu change officially was billed as internationalizing the
cuisine, Fellman said. Brandeis had always maintained one dining
hall for kosher students and another hall for others. But while the
non-kosher hall would serve milk with meat, violating strict Jewish
dietary laws, it did not serve meat considered impure in the Jewish
tradition until 1987.
   At about the same time, Brandeis removed the Hebrew word for
truth from the school's logo, Fellman said, and the university
calendar dropped references to Jewish holidays.
   Amid a campus outcry, the logo and holiday references have been
restored.
   Handler announced in June that she would resign at the end of
this school year. She's now on sabbatical.
   She has refused to discuss her decision to step down. ``I'm not
prepared to talk to you over the telephone or any other place,''
she said when asked for an interview.
   David Rosen, a university spokesman, said members of the
Brandeis community blew changes in the dining hall and the school
logo out of proportion.
   ``I think it's grossly unfair to suggest that she was trying to
disavow that (Jewish) heritage, but the controversy was cast in
those terms by some people,'' he said.
   ``These are all very terrible misunderstandings. They were all
just a bum rap.''
   He said Handler stressed the school's nonsectarian philosophy
and was seen as attempting to attract students from more diverse
backgrounds.
   She also tried to attract more donors to the school, which
largely relies on the American Jewish community. This year, the
school has had to institute a hiring freeze and cuts in spending to
make up a $3 million budget gap.
   The philosophy of the university has changed under the interim
president as it conducts a search for Handler's replacement, Rosen
said.
   ``I think the current interim president, Stuart Altman, while
reaffirming the interest in diversity, has also felt a need to be
more open and forthcoming about the Jewish heritage than Dr.
Handler did,'' he said.
   Fellman said the debate may be healthy for the school. ``I think
part of what Handler did inadvertently was to surface the issue of
Jewishness among many of us,'' he said.

   The assortment of 12 Christmas cards
includes smiling Santas and bouquets of holly wrapped in messages
of love, an angel of peace playing a flute, a pair of doves
floating above mistletoe and fir.
   No doubt greeting cards drawn by professional artists, you say?
No. They were crafted on Death Row by 10 inmates, two of whom have
been executed since their ink drawings first were published.
   Before his death in September 1987 for killing a probation
officer, Joseph Starvaggi envisioned the spirit of Christmas as a
floating angel playing the flute as the Star of Bethlehem shines
through her wing.
   Starvaggi's Angel of Hope is the second most popular card.
   The most frequently ordered Death Row design was drawn by Bob
Black, 43, convicted for the 1985 contract slaying of his wife. His
sketch shows an inmate hunched over a Bible inside a prison cell,
barren except for a paper Christmas tree and paper star taped to
the wall.
   The cards are marketed by Help Our Prisoners Exist, a support
group for Death Row inmates and their families that advocates the
abolition of capital punishment. The 12-card assortment sells for
$8.
   ``The cards show that Death Row inmates are sensitive human
beings,'' said Ken Robison, a stepfather of a Death Row inmate and
HOPE co-founder.
   ``A person influenced by drugs or alcohol or mental illness or
passionate rage can commit a terrible crime. We can't diminish that
fact,'' Robison said. ``That does not take away from the fact that
they are caring, creative people and they have a message.''

   The Coast Guard today called off a search for
10 crew members of a South Korean fishing boat missing for three
days since Typhoon Russ swept the area, officials said.
   A military transport ship located the partially submerged hull
of the 68-foot Marguarita I 35 miles off the southern tip of Guam
on Sunday, but there was no sign of the crew, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Assateague and a C130 aircraft searched a
19,000-square-mile area but didn't locate any crew members, said
Lt. Bob Ritchie of the Coast Guard Rescue Center on this U.S.
island territory in the Western Pacific. He said the search was
called off today.
   The Marguarita I sailed from Agana on Thursday, even though it
was well known the typhoon was bearing down on the island, said
Coast Guard Lt. Jeffrey Lee, duty officer for the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   The fishing vessel radioed its agent here late Thursday that it
was disabled with a clutch problem, Lee said.
   Communication with the boat was lost Friday when electrical
power went out on Guam as Typhoon Russ battered the island with
wind up to 150 mph.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said the storm
damged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes and injured 88 people. No
deaths were reported.
   Guam Power Authority officials said they expected to have
electrical power restored to 60 percent of the island today. Water
service remained disrupted in many areas because pumps were without
electrical power.
   Gov. Joseph Ada has asked President Bush to declare the island a
disaster area.

<TEXT>
   When the materialistic side of Christmas rears
its ugly head, child psychologists admit it often has a child's
face.
   Never mind visions of sugar plums. For many children, the only
things dancing in their heads - with all the resolution of a
Nintendo or TURBO-Grafx-16 home video game - are dreams of Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batman and Go-Go My Walking Pup.
   Experts on child development call it a natural process for
youngsters to want things. At around age 2, they say, the average
child says ``mine'' about everything in view. It's only over time
that they develop a sense of what is theirs and what belongs to
others.
   ``To learn how to give they first have to learn what it feels
like to be recipients - of love or gifts or whatever, so you could
consider it a developmental process,'' said Caroline Persell, head
of the sociology department at New York University.
   ``If it's sort of a stage that people have to go through,
hopefully they get beyond it when they see some of the fun of
thinking of gifts for other people. That's part of the fun of
Christmas.''
   But don't most children think 'tis better to receive than to
give?
   ``I think kids from a very young age are capable of being
totally selfish,'' said Martin Hoffman, head of the NYU psychology
department. ``But they are also capable of being quite empathic and
sympathetic toward others who do not have what they have.''
   The problem, Hoffman said, is not that children are inherently
selfish, but that Christmas thrusts them into a context that
surrounds them with all sorts of neat things they would like to
have. And they usually respond with according materialism, even
greed.
   But change the context, and the same child might offer a
pleasant surprise.
   ``Most kids, as greedy and self oriented as they appear when
they go to visit Santa in the department stores and sit on his lap
and ask for everything under the sun, if put into the position of
knowing that there are other children who have nothing - and if
there are adults around who make the suggestion that they might
want to share some of their things - most kids would share a lot,''
Hoffman said.
   Hoffman explained that children, and parents too, are bombarded
by television commercials that put them in the context of gift
getters, rarely as potential givers. But it needn't be that way,
Hoffman asserts.
   In that sense, Hoffman said, children reflect American society
as a whole.
   ``This whole American culture is probably the most materialistic
culture in the history of humankind. On the other hand it is also a
very giving culture.''

   Two sailors from the
aircraft carrier USS Midway were killed when a tour bus they were
on overturned, the military's Joint Information Bureau said today.
   Five other U.S. sailors were injured, of whom two were in
serious condition in the accident Sunday about 50 miles south of
al-Dhafra airbase in Abu Dhabi.
   The sailors were on shore leave, taking an off-road tour in an
all-terrain bus when the accident occurred, the military said. The
statement said the cause of the accident was under investigation.
   A Navy spokesman said that because of the remoteness of the
area, helicopters from the Midway flew to the scene to assist local
authorities.
   One of the injured was flown to the hospital ship USS Comfort
and three to the Midway. The whereabouts of the fifth were not
immediately known.
   The names of the dead and injured were being withheld, pending
notification of next of kin.
   The accident brought the number of U.S. deaths in Operation
Desert Shield to 80. On Saturday in the Mediterranean, a chartered
Israeli ferry carrying U.S. sailors capsized while returning to the
USS Saratoga from the Israeli port of Haifa, killing 21.
   It was the singe largest death toll from accidents related to
the operation. Five other Western military personnel have also
died.
   The Midway, currently deployed mainly in the Arabian Sea, was on
a port visit to Abu Dhabi.

   What was hailed as the nation's toughest VDT law won final
approval last week from the city Board of Supervisors, but Agnos
wouldn't commit to signing it until he talked to business and labor
groups about its impact and cost.
   After a weekend meeting with Agnos, the two sides agreed
Saturday to several amendments, one extending the compliance period
from two years to as many as four years, the mayor's aides said.
   The compromise, which Agnos plans to sign Thursday, must go back
to the supervisors for approval.
   ``This is an example of what happens when both sides come to the
table. And we now have something that both sides can live with,''
said Claude Everhart, deputy mayor for government operations, who
mediated the negotiations.
   The compromise measure still calls for frequent work breaks,
proper lighting, anti-glare screens, adjustable computer furniture
and equipment to make VDT use safer.
   Among the problems associated with regular work at a computer
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neck
strain, eye strain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nausea
and fatigue.
   Labor leaders hope the VDT law will be a model for other cities
and counties in California and for the state and other states
nationwide.
   Business groups have consistently opposed efforts to pass such
legislation because of its expense and because some doubt VDT use
causes health problems.
   City budget analysts estimate businesses will spend as much as
$76.5 million and the city as much as $6 million to comply with the
law.
   The board on Dec. 17 passed the ordinance on a 7-4 vote, just
short of the eight votes needed to override an Agnos veto.
   At Saturday's eight-hour meeting, business and labor leaders
agreed to implement the law in three stages.
   First, any new equipment purchased one year or more after the
law is adopted must conform to the new standards.
   Within 30 months, businesses must bring most workstations into
conformance with VDT safety standards.
   If doing so costs more than $250, those businesses will have an
additional 18 months to comply.
   The law applies to companies with 15 or more employees. It also
creates an advisory panel to monitor research about possible
radiation hazards and other heath effects from VDT use.

<HEAD>Bacteria Found That Remove Contaminants From Radioactive Waste
Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered harmless bacteria
that can remove radioactive contaminants from waste water, a report
published today said.
   The process does not resolve the problem of nuclear-waste
disposal,the research team from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in Tennessee cautioned.
   But the microbioal ``scrubbing'' of waste water does offer a
natural way to remove harmful metals and radioactive contaminants
in water that drains from facilities like radiology rooms, nuclear
power plants and atomic weapons factories, team scientists Dr.
Brendlyn D. Faison told The (Baltimore) Sun.
   The finding may lead to the biological filtration of water-borne
nuclear waste that would be cheaper and more effective than
chemical methods now in use, Faison said.
   ``In the case of widespread contamination of a water supply, as
occurred at Chernobyl, biological treatment may be a highly
cost-effective, environmentally acceptable approach to site
restoration,'' she told the newspaper.
   The process differs from biological treatment of oil spills, in
that the pollutants are not rendered harmless. Instead, the
bacteria bind with the particles, similar to magnets attracting
iron fillings.
   The bacteria become covered with radioactive particles and then
are filtered from the water to form a radioactive sediment that can
be more easily disposed of than if they had still been in solution,
Faison said.
   So far the government laboratory has completed tests with only
one bacterium - Micrococcus luteus - that can bind with strontium,
a metal commonly found in radioactive form in nuclear industry
waste water.
   The process is almost instantaneous and can reduce strontium
concentrations in water to almost immeasurable part-per-billion
levels, Faison said.
   The Oak Ridge research team is investigating other biological
methods of filtering radioactive metals. Faison said that one of
the more promising findings so far is a common alga that seems able
to efficiently remove cesium, another harmful metal.
   Diane D'Arrigo, spokeswoman for the anti-nuclear Nuclear
Information and Resource Service, said the Oak Ridge findings were
interesting, but the ``question is still, what do you do with the
radioactive microbes?''
   ``I hope this type of technology doesn't lead to the misguided
assumption that it's OK to contaminate water simply because it can
be cleared up more easily,'' she said.

   With voters in westward-looking
Slovenia urging secession by a nearly 9-to-1 margin, officials
today looked ahead to talks that may decide whether the republic
will break away from Yugoslavia.
   ``Within the next six months, Slovenia will decide whether to
stay in Yugoslavia or become an independent European country,''
Slovenian President Milan Kucan said.
   In Sunday's plebiscite, 88.2 percent voted for secession, and
thousands celebrated the results in the Slovenian capital of
Ljubljana by dancing in the streets and uncorking champagne.
   Four percent voted against secession, and the remainder of the
ballots were invalid, according to final unofficial results
provided by political parties.
   In the spring, Slovenia and Croatia ousted Communists in
landmark multiparty elections. Both republics have threatened to
secede unless Yugoslavia becomes a loose confederation of
semi-independent states.
   That put them on a collision course with Serbia, the largest and
most powerful of the multi-ethnic country's six republics and seat
of the federal capital, Belgrade.
   Less-developed Serbia, where authorities have been more
resistant to Western-style reforms, advocates a strong federal
government.
   Federal authorities have threatened armed intervention if any
republic moves to secede. They say all the republics must agree to
any secession.
   Serbia's Socialists - the renamed long-ruling Communists - won
87 seats of 96 parliamentary seats filled in a first round of
republic-wide elections on Dec. 9.
   In addition, Serbia's president, former Communist Slobodan
Milosevic, was re-elected to the state's presidency with 65 percent
of the vote.
   A second round of voting was held Sunday to fill the remaining
154 seats in the Serbian parliament and prominent Socialist
candidates, including Premier Stanko Radmilovic, were reportedly
upset, according to unofficial results.
   First official results of the vote were expected Tuesday,
electoral officials said. The turnout was reported at about 60
percent.
   Montenegro, the smallest republic, also had runoff elections
Sunday, but no results were available. The League of Communists is
in power there.
   The Slovene plebiscite law sets a six-month transition period to
bring armed forces, customs and border authorities under Slovene
control. A new constitution, a separate currency and the issuing of
Slovenian passports would follow, said the republic's Premier Lojze
Peterle.
   Negotiations on secession could start with the republic's share
of Yugoslavia's $9 billion hard currency reserves and its $17
billion foreign debt.
   Turnout in Slovenia's plebiscite was reported to be around 90
percent of 1.5 million eligible voters.
   ``This democratic decision by the Slovenian people, which gives
us the right to determine our own destiny, will not be to the
detriment of any other Yugoslav nation,'' said Kucan.
   The Central Intelligence Agency recently predicted that
Yugoslavia may disintegrate within 18 months and civil war could
break out.
   The Yugoslav presidency last week said Slovenia's referendum was
unacceptable. Defense Minister Gen. Veljko Kadijevic has threatened
intervention by the federal army to preserve the federation.
   Janez Jansa, Slovenia's minister in charge of the local
territorial defense, said his people would fight.
   ``We will use force to defend ourselves if the Yugoslav military
attacks us,'' he said Sunday.
   Slovenia, which neighbors Austria and Italy, is home to 2
million of Yugoslavia's 23 million people, but accounts for about
17 percent of the country's economic output and 30 percent of its
exports.
   Janez Drnovsek, Slovenia's representative in the eight-member
Yugoslav collective presidency, said in an interview Sunday that he
met last week with Milosevic for talks on the country's future.
   ``We have agreed that there is a need for dialogue,'' Drnovsek
said.
   In Montenegro, about 400,000 voters were eligible to choose
between Momir Bulatovic, the local Communist Party leader, and
Ljubisa Stankovic, an opposition candidate, for state president.
   Communists in Montenegro won 83 of the 125 seats in the
republic's legislature in the Dec. 9 first round and their leader
was widely expected to emerge victorious in Sunday's polling.

   France's defense minister canceled
a meeting with his Saudi counterpart after the kingdom refused to
allow a French rock star to entertain troops in the desert, a
French Embassy spokesman said today.
   ``There was a rather clipped exchange of diplomatic notes,''
said the embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonomity.
   There was no official Saudi announcement about the cancellation,
but the concert apparently would have offended the country's strict
Moslem tenets.
   ``Since the Saudis consider the whole country a mosque, you
really cannot show any Western culture, especially a rock or pop
concert,'' the embassy spokesman said.
   Eddy ``Schmoll' Mitchell was supposed to perform his 1950s-style
rock 'n' roll for soldiers stationed near the border with Kuwait at
Hafr al-Batin, where most of France's 5,000-man Rapid Action Force
is deployed.
   The embassy spokesman said France's defense chief, Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, was extremely angry when the concert was not allowed
to proceed. It was intended as a morale boost during the holiday
season.
   Chevenement was to have met this afternoon meeting with his
Saudi counterpart, Prince Sultan. Instead, he met with Sultan's
son, Lt. Gen. Prince Khalid, official head of the multinational
forces.
   There has been tension in the past between the French military
and the Saudi Defense Ministry over press visits to the troops.
   Saudi officials said they were not informed of all reporters
traveling north to visit the troops.
   The predominant Moslem sect in Saudi Arabia bans public
entertainment such as concerts and movies.
   Bob Hope, the only entertainer to visit during the Christmas
season in keeping with his 50-year tradition of troop shows, was
expected to meet with U.S. troops today and Tuesday.
   Out of sensitivity to the Saudis, no shows were officially
planned and media coverage was to be limited.

   Saddam Hussein says Tel Aviv will be Iraq's
first target if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, a Spanish
television station that conducted a weekend interview with the
Iraqi leader said today.
   Saddam has threatened before to attack Israel, but it was the
first time he said he would make the Jewish state his first target.
Such a strategy is presumably aimed at weakening the resolve of
moderate Arab members of the multinational force arrayed against
Iraq.
   The private television station Tele 5 broadcast brief video
images of the Saturday interview with Saddam, but no audio. It
plans to broadcast the entire interview on Wdnesday.
   The state-run news agency EFE, whose technicians took part in
the two-hour interview in Baghdad, quoted Saddam as saying Tel Aviv
would be Iraq's first target whether or not Israel joins an
international war effort against Iraq.
   Fearing such an attack, Israel has been distributing gas masks
to all its citizens.
   The United Nations has authorized the use of military force
after Jan. 15 if Iraq does not withdraw its troops from Kuwait.
   The Spanish TV interviewer, Luis Marinas, said Saddam contended
that the United States sent troops to the Persian Gulf following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait because it wants to control the
flow of petroleum from oil fields in the area.
   The Iraqi leader also said he believed that Thursday's
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was a
positive sign. He alleged that Shevardnadze had become too
influenced by the United States, Marinas said.
   No further details of the interview were immediately available.

<HEAD>After Spending Spree With Ransom, Seven Arrested in Kidnapping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven people accused of
kidnapping a multimillionaire's daughter were arrested soon after
they hired a limousine and went on a wild spending spree with
ransom money, police said.
   Cynthia Kilburn, 30, had been freed unharmed the night before.
   Among the places where her alleged abductors shopped was the
department store where one of them had picked up the ransom a day
earlier, police said. Security guards there recognized the man and
alerted police.
   Three men and four juveniles - one of them a girl - were
arrested Saturday and early Sunday. Charges were expected to be
filed today, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said.
   Kilburn was abducted Friday morning by several people who burst
into her North Vancouver home, police said. The intruders left her
4-year-old twin son and daughter tied up and alone in the house.
Kilburn's husband was not home at the time.
   Kilburn was released blindfolded but unharmed on a North
Vancouver street 14 hours later after her father, Jim Pattison,
paid a ransom. Police would not say how much he paid.
   Pattison, 62, chairman of the 1986 World's Fair in Vancouver, is
the sole shareholder of Jim Pattison Group, a conglomerate that
owns auto dealerships, supermarkets and radio stations. The group
had revenues estimated at $2 billion last year.
   The abductors had telephoned Pattison and directed him to leave
ransom money at a downtown Vancouver department store, RCMP
Constable Sheila Armstrong said.
   ``Store security got a good description of the person who picked
up the money,'' Armstrong said.
   On Saturday the pickup man, accompanied by another person,
returned to the store to shop, store security officers told police.
The pair had a chauffeur-driven limousine waiting outside.
   An all-points bulletin was put out for the limousine, and two
suspects were arrested when police spotted the car in a West
Vancouver shopping center. Five others were arrested elsewhere,
Armstrong said.
   RCMP also recovered a large sum of money and other items.
   The abductors told the limo driver Saturday they were
celebrating their last year of high school with a $20,000 spending
spree.
   ``One of the guys was in a store at Park Royal (shopping mall)
getting seven suits tailored,'' said chauffeur Dino Falcone.
   ``I was just getting into the car asking the guy in te back
seat where they wanted to go next, and then I saw a couple of
badges in the window.''
   Undercover police arrested a passenger in the car and a man in
the store, Falcone said.
   He said he picked up five males and a female in North Vancouver
at 11 a.m. Saturday after a man had called the limousine company
that morning saying he simply wanted to ``spend some money.''
   Falcone said he drove to four shopping centers, where his
passengers filled the limo's trunk with clothes, guitars and
jewelry.
   ``Everything was paid for in cash - I just thought that they
were pretty young so they wouldn't have credit cards,'' said
Falcone.
   ``One of the guys said his parents were very well-off, very
wealthy. I just figured there was a lot of rich kids around.''
   Falcone said they gave him a $100 tip ``but that's not unusual
at this time of year.''
   When North Vancouver RCMP swooped down on his limo, only two
were still in the car.

   An offbeat couple defied yuletide tradition
- and gravity - by hanging their Scotch pine, ornaments, lights and
even gift-wrapped boxes from the ceiling to create a topsy-turvy
Christmas.
   Jim and Judy Young knew the idea was different when a tree lot
worker shot them funny looks after they asked him to lift a tree by
its trunk so they could see how it looked upside-down.
   ``Then the boy looked at me and said, `Do you drink much?''' Jim
Young said. ``I gave him my address. I told him to come up to look
at it, after we got it decorated.''
   The 6-foot pine's needles point toward the floor. A twinkling
star dangles from its inverted apex. Lights and ornaments are
attached so their bottoms point toward the base of the tree as they
would if the tree were right side up. Only limp silver tinsel
icicles appear to obey the law of gravity.
   ``Can't seem to get them to go the other way,'' Young sighed.
   To complete the project, the Youngs glued brightly wrapped,
empty gift boxes to the ceiling around the base of the tree.
   ``It wouldn't be a tree without the presents,'' he said.

   A father died in a vain attempt to save
six of his children after he re-entered his home engulfed by
flames. The fire apparently was sparked by a Christmas tree that
fell over.
   Martin Dell'Orco, 38, at first escaped the fire but died when he
re-entered the ranch-style home, Fire Chief Melvin Paulun said
Sunday.
   Intense heat blocked firefighters from immediately entering the
house in this suburb 22 miles west of Detroit, Paulun said. One
firefighter suffered minor burns in the Saturday night blaze.
   Also trapped inside were Dell'Orco's children: Bonnie 12; Sara,
9; Katie, 8; twins Megan and Michael, 5; and Robert, 4.
   ``It's a tragedy almost beyond comprehension,'' said Steve
Garsela, 40, a neighbor and family friend. ``Marty lived for those
kids.''
   Dell'Orco's wife, Debbie, 36, escaped and later was released
from a hospital. Another son, Adam, 6, escaped unharmed. The two
other children, Jimmy, 16, and Kelly, 14, were away from home at
the time of the fire.
   The Dell'Orcos were described as devoted parents.
   The children ``were their whole life; they barely went out
without the kids,'' said Dell'Orco's sister, Mary Anne Belaire. She
said her brother was a carpenter.
   ``We had a lot of respect for these people,'' said Garsela.
``There are a lot of kids in this neighborhood and everyone is very
close.''
   ``They wanted a big family. Someone was saying they wanted 13 or
14 kids,'' said Chris Ruszkiewicz, 17, a neighbor and schoolmate of
Jimmy Dell'Orco. ``This is just awful.''
   Paulun said the investigation was continuing.

   Divers today abandoned the search for the
last of the 21 men drowned in the sinking of a ferry carrying
servicemen on shore leave back to the U.S. aircraft carrier
Saratoga, American officials said.
   The decision was made in consultation with Israeli authorities,
who felt there was no way of finding the body.
   The U.S. Embassy said it was assumed the body would eventually
wash ashore. The missing man was identified as Aviation
Ordinanceman 3rd Class Anthony J. Fleming, 25, of Buffalo, N.Y.
   Ferry service to the Saratoga was suspended after the only
available ferry snarled its propeller in a cable early today, the
embassy said.
   With only a limited number of helicopters available for shuttle
service, many of the Saratoga's crew who had gone on shore leave
were to spend Christmas on land instead of returning to the
carrier.
   First preference for helicopter furloughs went to servicemen who
were aboard the ferry that capsized early Saturday and their
rescuers, followed by those whose wives or girlfriends flew to
Israel for the holidays, a Navy lieutenant said on condition of
anonymity.
   Crewmen bade a tearful farewell to their 21 comrades at a
memorial service Sunday aboard the Saratoga. The dead were
symbolized by rows of sailors' caps and a petty officer's hat laid
out on a table.
   ``There are no words that can express the heartfelt sorrow of
this entire 5,000-man ship,'' said the carrier's skipper, Capt.
Joseph S. Mobley.
   Among the 1,200 mourners were many of the 81 survivors of the
chartered Israeli ferry Tuvia, which capsized and sank as it
carried 102 Saratoga crewmen back from a shore leave.
   Mobley told reporters that the Navy concluded with ``utmost
confidence'' that Fleming had died. ``He was definitely on the
ferry at the time of the accident, he was definitely not rescued,''
he said.
   Nineteen bodies were recovered Saturday, including six pulled by
Israeli divers from the sunken, two-deck ferry.
   Another was found Sunday, shortly before a military air
transport left for Dover Air Base in Delaware with the corpses.
   The plane was delayed several hours and was to arrive this
afternoon. Air Force Lt. Teresa Schallock said strong headwinds had
forced the plane to divert to Britain to take on more fuel.
   At the memorial service in one of the Saratoga's huge aircraft
hangars, men wiped away tears as a choir sang ``America the
Beautiful'' and the Navy hymn ``Eternal Father.''
   Two sailors dropped a wreath into the Mediterranean in honor of
the victims, and a detachment of seven Marines fired a 21-gun
salute in three rifle salvos.
   ``We have suffered a very great tragedy. Every man on this
mighty ship has had his heart in his throat, tears in his eyes and
a knot in his stomach since that event,'' Mobley said.
   The Saratoga task force, based at Mayport Naval Air Station in
Florida, includes the destroyer Sampson, cruiser South Carolina and
combat stores ship Sirius. It has a crew of 6,200 men.
   The Saratoga and its escort ships had come from the Red Sea
where they joined in the naval buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Two Israeli investigations and one probe by the U.S. Navy are
under way into the ferry sinking.
   Survivors said water was washing into the 57-foot ferry from
waves when it was suddenly swamped by two huge swells about 200
yeards from the Saratoga. Israeli officials believe too many men
were gathered in the back of the craft.

   A man who allegedly held up a fast food
restaurant while wearing a George Bush mask was arrested after his
car wouldn't start and he asked the restaurant manager for a jump
start.
   Olathe police were holding an 18-year-old Texas man, who was not
immediately identified. He was in the parking lot trying to jump
start his car in frigid cold when officers arrived about 12:30 a.m.
Sunday.
   ``When he went to leave, his car wouldn't start, so he went back
in and asked the manager for a jump start,'' Olathe police Lt.
Vernon Watson said.
   Watson said the man was being held in the Johnson County Jail
pending arraignment. He was expected to be charged with attempted
aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping.
   Another police spokesman, Lt. Larry Griffin, said today that he
couldn't explain why the man would be charged with attempted
robbery rather than robbery, except that he never left the
restaurant's property.
   Police said the restaurant manager found the masked man in a
restroom after the shop had closed. Brandishing an air pistol, the
robber forced employees to open a safe and then locked them in a
cooler.
   Then, when his car wouldn't start, the man brought the manager
outside with him to work on the car, Watson said.
   The manager had called police through a computer and officers
surprised the man while he was trying to get the car started,
Watson said. The man had been in the area only a few days and was
staying in a motel, he said.
   Olathe is just south of Kansas City, where the temperature at
the time of the robbery was 2 degrees.

   A shopping mall in Hiroshima repainted a huge
rooftop Santa Claus it had portrayed as a black man after black
residents reportedly complained, a professor said today.
   The 18-foot-high black Santa had exaggeratedly fat lips,
diamond-studded rings, sunglasses and sneakers.
   Such caricatures of blacks are common in Japanese advertising,
but are becoming less popular due to criticism of racial
stereotyping.
   The Santa was put up in November on a fake brick chimney above
the Sun Mall in Hiroshima, 430 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Peter Goldsbury, a professor of philosophy at Hiroshima
University, put a photo of the Santa on the cover of his local
magazine ``Hiroshima Sign Post,'' after he heard that black
foreigners living in the city were upset by the figure's
exaggerated features.
   ``I wanted to make people talk,'' Goldsbury said. ``Hiroshima is
supposed to be a center of `international peace culture,' but here
was yet another example of undesirable cultural stereotyping.''
   After the nationwide newspaper Asahi Shimbun also drew attention
to the black Santa, his face was coated with light-colored paint
and a white beard was added to cover his thick lips, Goldsbury
said.
   Managers at the shopping mall were not available for comment
today because of a national holiday.
   Japan has drawn harsh criticism from the United States in recent
years for toys and books unflatteringly portraying black characters
and for controversial racial remarks made by politicians.
   In November, a Japanese city that is bidding for the 1998 Winter
Olympics advised schools and libraries to destroy materials
featuring the ``Little Black Sambo'' character - another stereotype
that has drawn protests - to improve the city's image.
   In August, a citizen's group forced a major publishing house to
strike out expressions and drawings exaggerating physical features
of blacks in five popular comic books.
   In the most recent controversial racial comments, Justice
Minister Seiroku Kajiyama in September angered minority groups when
he compared American blacks to prostitutes who ``ruin the
atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into.''

<HEAD>Arens Names Committee to Study Separate Gaza Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens appointed a
committee today to study possible economic development in the
occupied Gaza Strip, in what was seen as a first step toward
separating the territory's economy from Israel's.
   Any encouragement of development in the occupied territories
would be a reversal of Israel's policy of keeping Gaza and the West
Bank dependent on Israeli goods and employing Palestinians as cheap
labor in Israel.
   A Defense Ministry statement announced formation of the
committee, headed by economist Ezrah Sadan. The statement said the
group also will investigate the relationship between the economies
of Gaza and Israel.
   According to the daily Haaretz, a ministerial committee headed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir recently gave the Israeli military
government in the territories ``a green light to push for
establishment of an independent economic infrastructure in the
territories.''
   In line with this policy, the military administration has
approved the creation of dozens of new plants and given licenses to
factories that operated illegally without them, Haaretz said in a
report published Sunday.
   The newspaper said this decision deviated from Israel's policy
since the West Bank and Gaza were occupied in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Haaretz described the previous policy as one designed to
``strangle the expression of independent economic initiative.''
   Because of the policy, however, Israel has become dependent on a
Palestinian work force of more than 100,000 people. Most hold
low-paid jobs in construction, restaurants and other fields.
   But following a wave of stabbing attacks by Arabs, Israelis have
demanded the government limit the number of Palestinians allowed to
work in Israel. The stabbing attacks followed the Oct. 8 Temple
Mount riot in which Israeli police killed 17 Palestinians.
   The military government has increased to 10,000 the number of
Palestinians considered a security risk and banned from entering
Israel. Many Arabs have lost their jobs in Israel following strikes
and nationalist attacks linked to the 3-year-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Economics Minister David Magen said last week that he has won
wide government backing for a plan to refuse entry to about 60,000
Palestinians working in Israel without a permit. This would also
reate employment for newly arrived Soviet immigrants, expected to
reach in the hundreds of thousands.
   Haaretz noted the reason for encouraging the territories'
economy was the fear that rising Palestinian unemployment, coupled
with lack of economic infrastructure, could create ``a ticking time
bomb'' in the West Bank and Gaza.
   About 65,000 Gazans, or half the local labor force, are employed
in Israel. If fired, they stand little chance of finding work in
the impoverished strip, home to 750,000 Palestinians. About 1
million Arabs live in the West Bank.

<TEXT>
   The main colors of
Christmas Eve in Bethlehem this year were purple, red, black and
green - the hues of the berets of hundreds of soldiers dispatched
to provide security in the holy town.
   Only a few dozen tourists were seen as the Roman Catholic
Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabah, arrived in Bethlehem at
midday to open the Christmas season in the Holy Land.
   A light drizzle fell as a procession of priests led Sabah
through Manger Square and into the Church of the Nativity, built
over the grotto where tradition holds that Christ was born.
   A strike called by the leadership of the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip closed
all shops and restaurants in Bethlehem.
   There were no holiday decorations, as officials of this town of
40,000 canceled most celebrations in solidarity with the 3-year-old
revolt.
   The Tourism Ministry predicted that fewer than 7,000 people
would visit Bethlehem this year, down from 10,000 last year.
   Tourism in Israel has been cut in half by the Persian Gulf
crisis, and many of the Arab hotels in Jerusalem that cater to
Christian pilgrims are shut because of too few guests.
   Bethlehem's Palestinian mayor, Elias Freij, issued a statement
praying for ``peace on earth and goodwill toward all people and
peace in the Holy Land between Israelis and Palestinians, and peace
amongst all the Arabs.''
   Freij, however, blamed the lack of tourists on a U.S. State
Department warning for Americans not to travel to the Middle East.
   ``It is the fault of the American greed, to fight for the oil in
Kuwait and to disregard the human rights of all people here,'' he
said.
   Before the uprising, thousands of pilgrims would gather for
holiday festivities in Bethlehem and elsewhere.
   Gabriele Beitz, a tourist from Heidelberg, Germany, was visiting
along with her husband and 11-year-old daughter, and said she was
frightened at ``finding the streets so empty, it is a very, very
fearful situation.''
   ``We are very depressed about the place and about the whole
political situation here,'' she said. ``For us, Christmas is an
event of peace, and here you cannot feel peace.''
   In Manger Square, Sabah was greeted by the Israeli military
governor of Bethlehem, Dudu Mufaz. The greeting is a tradition that
stretches back to the times when the Turks and then the British
ruled Palestine.
   As a Christmas gesture, the military announced it was releasing
217 Palestinian prisoners arrested during the uprising.
   Despite the lack of tourists, an Israeli-sponsored choir concert
was going ahead. But only one visiting choir, from the First United
Methodist Church of Oklahoma City, was to take part in the event.
   Security was especially heavy in Bethlehem this year because of
a wave Arab-Jewish clashes following the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riot
in which Israeli police killed 17 Palestinians.
   Thousands of Israeli soldiers and police manned roadblocks and
rooftop observation posts on roads leading to Bethlehem and inside
the town.
   Metal detectors were set up at the seven streets leading to
Manger Square, and everyone entering was searched.
   Army curfews were imposed on the three refugee camps in the
area, confining 15,000 Arabs to their homes.
   Last year, some cars were stoned passing the camps.

   The Navy is continuing its investigation of
the ferry accident that took the lives of 21 sailors off the
Israeli port of Haifa but it is uncertain when it will be
completed, a spokesman said today.
   ``It will be moved forward as quickly as possible, considering
the tragedy involved here and the need for answers, but it has to
be done very carefully to make sure all the facts are considered,''
Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke said.
   Van Dyke, an officer in the Navy Public Affairs Office at the
Pentagon, said the investigation is being conducted by Rear Adm.
George N. Gee, commander of Destroyer Group 8.
   The men who drowned were on their way back to the U.S. aircraft
carrier Saratoga, under Gee's command, following shore leave in
Haifa.
   Van Dyke said the results of Gee's investigation will go to Vice
Adm. William A. Owens, commander of the 6th Fleet, for review when
it is completed.
   ``We would like to able to pin down a day, but there is no way
to predict at this point,'' Van Dyke said.
   The spokesman said the Navy is also cooperating in two
investigations by Israeli authorities, including an effort to
recover the Tuvia, the ferry that capsized and sank.
   Survivors said water was washing into the 57-foot ferry from
waves when it was suddenly swamped by two huge swells about 200
yards from the Saratoga. Israeli officials believe too many men
were gathered in the back of the craft.

<HEAD>Miami Herald Executive Editor Remembered As Warm, Professional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miami Herald Executive Editor Janet
Chusmir, who died of a brain ailment, was remembered as ``a warm
and generous person'' but also a strong-minded one.
   ``She was a rock, a solid center, an unfailing fountain of
qualities that are in desperately short supply these days - sanity,
humor, fairness, graciousness, wisdom,'' Pulitzer prize-winning
Herald humor columnist Dave Barry said funeral services here
Sunday.
   ``She was the best.''
   Chusmir, a widely respected professional whose 27-year career
marked firsts for a woman of her generation, was selected last
month as the National Press Foundation's editor of the year. She
was to have received the award in February.
   She died early Saturday after suffering an aneurysm - an
enlargement in the wall of an artery or vein - Friday evening. She
was 60.
   Chusmir, Barry said, often stopped by in the Herald newsroom
``to talk, to laugh, to gossip.'' He called her ``the heart of the
Herald.''
   ``I'm not suggesting that, just because she was a warm and
generous person, she was also some kind of pushover. She was most
definitely not,'' Barry told the 500 mourners gathered for the
services.
   The changes and opportunities presented to women of her
generation were epitomized in Chusmir's life and career. A native
of Boston, she graduated from Boston University in 1949 with a
degree in journalism.
   She met her future husband, Leonard, her first week at the
university, and the couple were married after graduation. Chusmir
then stayed at home and raised their two children.
   Only 14 years later, in 1963, when the family moved to Miami
Beach, did she start her career in journalism. The first job paid
$2.50 a story at the now-defunct Miami Beach Daily Sun.
   In 1968, Chusmir was hired by the Herald. A regular column and a
collection of awards for feature writing soon followed. By 1977,
she had worked her way up to assistant managing editor for
features.
   In 1982, the Herald's parent company, Knight-Ridder Newspapers,
named her publisher and president of the Boulder, Colo., Daily
Camera, making her the organization's first female chief executive.
   Five years later, Chusmir returned to the Herald, this time as
executive editor, the senior newsroom position.
   In 1988, the Herald won two Pulitzer prizes, one to Barry for
commentary and another to Michel DuCille for a photo essay on a
crack-plagued neighborhood.
   Her family was important to her, her husband said, but ``she
loved being a general assignment reporter, she loved being a
columnist. She loved all aspects of it.
   ``She was the first everything for Knight-Ridder,'' Leonard
Chusmir said.
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Steven;
daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro; and grandson Matthew Shapiro.

<TEXT>
   A conservative mentioned as a possible
challenger to President Bush in the 1992 presidential sweepstakes
has set up a political action committee, often an early step toward
a presidential run.
   But former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont told The Union Leader of
Manchester that the purpose of his Committee for Republican
Leadership is to fight taxes, not launch a presidential bid.
   Du Pont, who ran for the Republican nomination in 1988, said
another prominent conservative's characterization of the
organization as a ``campaign exploratory committee'' is off base.
   ``That's plain wrong,'' du Pont said of the description, by
Richard Viguerie in a opinion piece last week in The New York
Times.
   Du Pont said there is a legal difference between issue-oriented
political action committees like his and exploratory campaign
committees.
   ``This is the fourth organization like this I've started in my
career and each time there has been speculation that this is just a
shell. ... This is a specific committee to deal with the economy,''
he said.
   He said the committee is not anti-Bush, but he remains staunchly
opposed to the tax increases in the deficit-reduction package
passed with administration support in October. ``It was an awful
bill and we hope the administration will come home,'' du Pont said.

<TEXT>
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela,
celebrating his first Christmas at home in nearly 30 years,
appealed to South Africans today to work for peace so blacks never
again spend the holiday ``in chains.''
   In Pretoria, ANC President Oliver Tambo met for the first time
with President F.W. de Klerk today. The meeting was described as a
``courtesy visit.'' Afterward, Tambo told reporters he hoped South
Africa would have a ``full recovery from apartheid'' by Christmas
next year.
   An Information Ministry statement said de Klerk wished Tambo
continued recovery from a severe stroke he suffered in August 1989,
and said both agreed violence must end for proper negotiations to
begin.
   Speaking to reporters in his Soweto home, Mandela recalled his
first Christmas in the notorious Robben Island prison, where he was
sent after being convicted of plottng against the government and
sentenced to life in prison.
   Inmates were not permitted family visits, and celebration was
limited to eating sweets provided by the church, Mandela said.
   He paused, then said with a smile, ``I've never cared for sweets
in my life, but in prison I thought that they were very delectable
indeed.''
   As years went by, he said, conditions improved. Prisoners were
allowed to order special groceries for the holiday and created
their own celebrations.
   ``But that is nothing compared to what I look forward to at the
moment, when I am able to celebrate Christmas as a free man,'' said
Mandela, who was freed from prison in February.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, read
a 2{-page message in which he lamented continuing political
violence but expressed optimism for a peaceful future.
   ``The South Africa so many have sacrificed so much to achieve is
in sight,'' he said, and he urged people of all political
affiliations to ``persist in their noble efforts'' to solve the
nation's problems peacefully.
   ``Let us vow never to celebrate another Christmas in chains,''
he said.
   Mandela did not mention the government or de Klerk but appeared
to direct his message at them when he said:
   ``Our thoughts turn to all those others in the country who will
not be with their families; those who are still held as political
detainees and prisoners... I also refer to the thousands of our
people who are still in exile who, like the prisoners, had hoped
that in light of the changes taking place in our country, they too
would be spending Christmas with their relatives.''
   In other developments today, police said eight people died over
the weekend in unrest in Natal Province, including two people shot
to death by police. The unrest report did not specify exactly when
the incidents occurred.

   Conservative lawmakers submitted a resolution to
the national parliament today demanding daily government briefings
on the Persian Gulf crisis and a vote before any Soviet troops are
sent to the region.
   The resolution was put forward by Col. Viktor Alksnis on behalf
of the increasingly vocal hard-line Soyuz faction.
   The resolution says President Mikhail S. Gorbachev needs
permission from the Supreme Soviet legislature before he can send
military forces abroad, the independent Interfax news agency said.
   The Supreme Soviet is the standing legislature elected by the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, now holding its fourth
session in the Kremlin.
   Interfax said the resolution also calls for the Foreign Ministry
to brief the Supreme Soviet daily on the gulf situation.
   It also asks a special legislative session held on the topic
Jan. 14, the day before a United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face a possible military attack.
   The Soviet Union voted for the U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing use of force after the date, but has not committed any
troops to participate in an attack.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who announced his
resignation last week, repeatedly denied there were any plans to
send Soviet troops to the region.
   Shevardnadze had accused Alksnis, the lawmaker who put forth the
resolution, of persecuting him. Alksnis was quoted today by the
German newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten as calling for a
parliamentary investigation of Shevardnadze, with what he called
``criminal consequences.''

   For many, Christmas is a time of peace and
religious celebration, but for atheists it can be a time to protest
Nativity scenes in city halls or crosses in parks.
   Many such symbols of religion overlapping into secular society
are disappearing as activists work year-round to build a stronger
wall between church and state.
   Some targets are obscure, like the notice for a church event
posted on a park district's community event board. Others can't be
missed, such as the ``God Reigns'' motto blazoned in a city seal
across a 136-foot water tower.
   The crusade may not be vehement, but constitutional wrongs must
be righted, said Robert I. Sherman, national spokesman for American
Atheists Inc.
   ``I don't go out trolling for crosses. But often people will see
a display and, if it offends them, they'll call me,'' Sherman said.
   The constitutional separation between church and state has been
a perennial battlefield for atheists and religious believers.
Atheists have maintained that religious symbols have no place in
government or on public property. Churches have argued that they
have a right to express their beliefs in public forums, and that to
do so does not violate the separation of church and state.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled several times on the issue,
most recently in October when it refused to allow the display of a
Christmas nativity scene on the lawn of a county government
building in Charlottesville, Va.
   In other rulings, however, the court has ruled that religious
symbols can be displayed in some cases when secular symbols are
alongside them.
   Sherman's group is one of the most active in opposing religious
displays on public property.
   In one case, Sherman challenged lighted Christmas crosses on two
water towers in Wauconda. Although they were a 42-year tradition,
the village backed down last December and quit erecting them.
   Many of the nation's test cases stem from Sherman's vigilance,
including a four-year fight against the town motto of Zion, ``God
Reigns.'' A federal appeals court is reviewing an appeal by Zion of
a lower court ruling that the motto must go.
   Activists also have demanded that officials move Nativity scenes
off city hall lawns, that PTA officials stop saying prayers before
meetings and that cities stop paying for community prayer
breakfasts.
   In Utah, the printing of ``In God We Trust'' on U.S. currency is
again an issue, and the practice of granting churches tax-exempt
status is being questioned in Texas.
   Even the oath for the Boy Scouts of America has come under fire
for requiring members to pledge to ``do my duty to God and my
country.'' Objectors say the Scouts are tacitly government-linked
because some groups are sponsored by public schools.
   ``What we are dealing with is a war of symbols,'' said Madalyn
Murray O'Hair, founder of the Texas-based American Atheists, which
claims 50,000 families as members.
   ``If you accept the symbol you accept everything that goes with
it,'' she said. ``Broad symbols become a beckoning to breach the
wall of separation between church and state.''
   Another American Atheists success came in Downers Grove, where a
high school football coach stopped leading a post-game prayer after
Sherman raised a challenge.
   ``Saying the Lord's Prayer after games did represent a violation
of the separation of church and state,'' said school Superintendent
David Hendrix. ``We felt that we had erred.''
   Some cities, like Zion, would rather fight.
   The town of fewer than 20,000, about 50 miles north of Chicago,
has spent more than $100,000 defending the municipal seal,
officials said. Residents have donated about a third of the money.
   The seal, displayed on the city's water tower and vehicles,
features a cross, a dove of peace and the motto.
   Zion officials argue that the seal has a historic rather than
religious value in the city founded as a utopian community in 1902
by a faith healer.
   ``We are entitled to reflect the heritage of our town,'' said
Mayor Adeline Geo-Karis. ``The majority of our people support the
seal.''
   But fighting the atheists' challenges can be too costly for
cities forced to hire expensive legal help, while American Atheists
has a salaried, in-house attorney.
   ``That's the beauty of the whole thing,'' O'Hair said.

<HEAD>Report: Dissident Professor Released in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have freed a university
professor who had been under detention at a guest house in central
China for 15 months, a Hong Kong newspaper reported today.
   The independent Ming Pao Daily News said Wen Yuankai, a
chemistry professor at Hefei University in Anhui province, was
released on Dec. 17.
   Fang Lizhi, the exiled Chinese dissident and astrophysicist,
taught at the same university before he was stripped of the post in
early 1987 following student-led pro-democracy protests on the
campus.
   The paper quoted Wen as saying that he was initially kept in a
secret place in the campus area, but later was transferred to a
guest house run by police.
   The report did not say why Wen, 44, was released. He was
arrested following the violent military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in China last year when hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of activists were killed.
   After the repression, the Chinese authorities began nationwide
arrests.
   According to Ming Pao, Wen had been arrested for his ``stubborn
insistence on bourgeois liberalization,'' a term used by Communist
Chinese authorities to criticize the capitalist Western world.
   The professor said that during his detention he was allowed to
read newspapers, and overseas science journals, receive family
letters and watch television. But family members were not allowed
to visit him, the paper said.
   During his confinement, Wen taught himself Japanese and finished
a 200,000-word research paper, Ming Pao said.
   Wen said officials at Hefei University told him he could return
to his previous teaching and research post, but that he has not
received any formal notice as to when he might resume his duties,
the paper said.
   ``I hope I'm not going to end up working as a cashier at the
university canteen. In that case, I'd rather work as a hawker and
sell boiled eggs on the street,'' the newspaper quoted wen as
saying.
   Wen's reported release came as authorities in Beijing prepared
trials for activists considered the most serious offenders in last
year's pro-democracy turmoil. Several other dissidents have also
been released recently. They include Wang Zhihong, wife of Chen
Ziming, publisher of a now-banned journal, who had been jailed for
more than a year without formal charge.
   Her husband, Chen Ziming, is charged with trying to overthrow
the government, and could receive a maximum penalty of death.

   Representatives of a Nobel Peace Prize-winning

gone too far, causing the infant mortality rate there to double.
   ``The embargo is not only working, at this point it is

Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
   ``The blockade is total - no vaccines, no medicines'' are
reaching Iraq, said William Monning, an attorney and executive
director of the Cambridge-based group.
   Monning also said that Jordan, which took in more than 700,000
Kuwaiti refugees, has had problems receiving aid.
   Pastore said sanctions against Iraq have led to a shortage of
milk for infants and medicines for the general public.
   Five members of the physicians' group - three from the United
States, one from the Soviet Union, and one from Germany - took an
eight-day tour of medical and health centers in the Persian Gulf,
including centers in Baghdad. Several participants returned to
Boston's Logan International Airport on Saturday.
   The group, which received the peace prize in 1985, said
embargoes against Iraq have not been limited to economic and
military supplies, but also foods and medicines considered exempt
for humanitarian reasons.
   Officially, medicine is not embargoed under the U.N. sanctions,
and food may be sent in if the U.N. Security Council's committee on
sanctions decides it is needed for humanitarian purposes. The
committee has allowed several shipments of food to foreign
nationals who were running short on provisions, but not any for the
general public in Iraq or Kuwait.
   The Iraqis claim that despite the exemption of medicine, the
naval and air embargo is halting shipments of medicine. And they
say babies are endangered by shortages of formula.
   Some Western diplomats in Baghdad are skeptical about the Iraqi
claim on medicine, suggesting that medicine is being diverted from
the civilian population to the army.
   Dr. Bernard Lown, co-president of the physicians group, said he
realizes the U.N. embargo does not include medical supplies, but
still they are not getting through.
   ``We could see the end result,'' he said. ``Too many doctors,
the Red Cross, UNICEF, do not have drugs in Baghdad today.''
   Lown said medical workers told him suppliers would not sell
medicine to them. ``Nobody's stopping the drugs, but nobody's
selling them,'' he added.
   Pastore said the physicians' group will ask the United Nations
to re-evaluate the embargoes.
   ``We think the United Nations should investigate the situation,
because it's a violation of the Geneva Convention and all other
humanitarian conventions to embargo humanitarian supplies,''
Pastore said Saturday.
   Pastore said 32,000 tons of dried milk paid for by Iraq sits in
Turkey because of the sanctions. He said the scarcity of milk has
driven the price up to about $21 for two quarts.
   The physicians group representatives met political leaders in
Jordan and spoke with Parliament members in Iraq. They did not meet
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but ``we are hoping the
physicians there will influence the Iraq government,'' Lown said.
   The group said Iraqi physicians promised them to fight to end
the production of nuclear and biological weapons in the Middle
East. A group chapter was set up in Iraq during the trip, bringing
the group's total number of affiliates worldwide to 70.
   Pastore, Lown and Monning were joined on the tour by Dr. Ulrich
Gottstein of Germany, the IPPNW's vice president for Europe, and
Dr. Sergei Kolesnikov of the Soviet Union.

   Christmas Eve 1990 arrived with a combination of record cold in
the western two-thirds of the nation and lingering spring-like
warmth along the East Coast, with violent downpours of snow, sleet
and rain between the two air masses.
   Nearly a foot of rain in parts of Alabama, Kentucky and
Tennessee caused flooding that forced the evacuation of hundreds
from low-lying areas.
   A different problem with water is spreading through the area of
cold - burst, frozen water pipes. Scores of people in Utah lost
water service and numerous fire alarms were activated when water
lines to indoor sprinkler systems snapped when the state tied or
broke 54 low temperature records Sunday.
   The Northeast cooled rapidly as the cold front marking the
leading edge of the arctic air pushed through Sunday and today.
   Typifying the contrast was Pennsylvania, which had freezing rain
and high winds in the west Sunday and record highs in the east.
Philadelphia peaked at 66, while 300 miles away a Christmas tree in
downtown Pittsburgh, where highs reached the mid 30s, was blown
down by 55 mph wind.
   Thirty-six eastern cities posted record high temperatures for
the date Sunday, including a 71 as far north as Washington, D.C.,
which matched a mark set in 1875. Wilmington, N.C., hit 78 and
record highs in the 60s reached as far north as southern parts of
New Hampshire and Maine.
   New York tied its record at 66 Sunday but by midmorning today
the temperature was falling through the 40s. Indiana was thoroughly
engulfed by the cold today with lows down to 5 below zero and wind
chills to 40 below.
   On the northern Plains and in the mountains of the West, subzero
cold was commonplace. Even typically balmy Arizona was no oasis
from the chill, with freezing lows statewide Sunday.
   ``I don't know what to say. ... My mouth's frozen,'' said
William Alder, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Utah,
where a minus 57 reading was recorded in Middle Sink, in high
mountains near Logan.
   Even Southern California stayed cold today with lows of 28 in
the Los Angeles enclave of Burbank, 25 up the coast at Santa
Barbara, and 6 in Lancaster, north of Los Angeles over the San
Gabriel Mountains.
   In Montana, rancher Jim Brenden has been putting in 20-hour days
to care for livestock weathering wind-chill factors as low as 40
below. Chores include chipping ice from water troughs and animals'
hooves.
   ``Cows are like wood stoves,'' Brenden said while untying roles
of hay. ``The colder it gets, the more you have to feed them.''
   At least 73 deaths have been blamed on weather since the cold
wave hit Tuesday. Most were traffic fatalities but some victims
died of hypothermia or from fires blamed on overworked heaters or
fireplaces.
   Hardest hit was Texas with 20 reported deaths, 17 in traffic
crashes. Many ice-glazed bridges and roadways there had buildups as
thick as 1 inch today.
   About 12,500 Tupelo, Miss.-area residents were left in the cold
after a natural gas pipe under the Tombigbee River broke Sunday.
Divers repaired the break blamed on the cold and flooding, but
service wasn't expected to be restored before Christmas.
   Hundreds of people evacuated low-lying areas along the Tennessee
River, after nearly a foot of rain.
   ``We can't turn the faucet off,'' said Fred Keeney, a planner in
Morgan County, Ala. ``We don't really know how many evacuations.
We've got a lot of people who have been moved.''
   The rain was diminishing somewhat, but water was expected to
keep rising today, said Jerral Miller, a NWS meteorologist in
Huntsville, Ala.
   ``It very definitely spoiled Christmas for a lot of people,''
Miller said.
   Despite the cold, skiers in the West reveled on the slopes.
   ``It was great. I've never seen so much snow in my life,'' Alex
Gonzales, 52, said after a day of skiing at New Mexico's Sandia
Peak, outside Albuquerque, which got 52 inches of snow from the
storm.
   Farmers fought a losing battle to save citrus and winter
vegetable crops.
   In California, the San Joaquin Valley citrus crop was virtually
wiped out by the cold, weather service meteorologist Dan Gudgel
said after a survey of growers.
   ``It's the most extensive damage I've seen, ever,'' said Clark
Briggs, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation,
which represents about 45,000 farmers.

   Bone-chilling cold in the West collided with a rare winter warm
front over the East today, generating heavy snow, sleet and rain
that caused serious flooding in parts of the South.
   A slew of winter weather warnings and advisories were posted
from coast to coast as the Arctic front that froze most of the West
last week edged toward the Atlantic.
   Snow fell today in the Ohio Valley, and was forecast for the
northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains, northern Plains and Great
Lakes region.
   Heavy rain was expected in the East, Southeast and Appalachian
states.
   Subfreezing temperatures were common throughout the West and
Midwest.
   After record highs throughout the East on Sunday, including 71
degrees as far north as Washington, D.C., and highs in the 60s into
southern Maine, temperatures cooled considerably today.
   By Christmas Day, East Coast highs were likely to peak around 30
degrees. A cold snap continued in the West, but frigid temperatures
were expected to moderate somewhat.

   U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region were on heightened alert
against potential attacks on Christmas Eve as the military observed
the holiday with subdued celebrations and light duties, a military
source said.
   Iraq, in a sign of rising tensions, summoned its ambassadors to
the United States and the United Nations to Baghdad for
consultations with President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi Embassy in
Washington said.
   The embassy spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the envoy to Washington, Mohamed Al-Mashat, and U.N. Ambassador
Abdul Al-Anbari, were expected to remain in Baghdad for a week or
two. He declined to elaborate.
   Saddam, meanwhile, told Spanish television that Tel Aviv will be
Iraq's first target if war breaks out. The Iraqi president had
threatened the Jewish state even before the gulf crisis began
nearly five months ago, but it was the first time he said Israel
would be Iraq's first target.
   The Spanish TV network summarized Saddam's remarks, made
Saturday, and said the interview with him would be shown on
Wednesday.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in response that Iraq
would be ``harmed in a most serious way'' if it attacks Israel.
Asked whether war was likely, he said on Israel radio: ``I would
say the danger is very close.''
   A senior Palestine Liberation Organization official was quoted
today as saying the PLO would fight alongside the Iraqis if war
breaks out.
   ``We have coordinated our plans to fight with Iraq in one
trench,'' Hani Al-Hassan, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's chief
political adviser, told the Iraqi daily newspaper Al-Jumhuriya.
   Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf, had told reporters last week the U.S. troops would be
ready to counter any military move by Iraq over the holidays.
   ``We are going to be on a heightened state of alert,''
Schwarzkopf said. ``I don't tell the enemy anything, but I will
damn sure tell Saddam Hussein that he should not expect us to be
al stood down on Christmas and think that he's going to catch us
napping and asleep on Christmas Day. That's not going to happen.''
   A military source who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed
the heightened alert status today. In Saudi Arabia, sentries at
military guardposts made more thorough checks than usual, and Saudi
Arabian police had checkpoints set up on highways.
   However, most troops had a light-duty day, meaning they could
sleep late or engage in sports activities.
   Off the coast of Israel, the search was called off for the last
of 21 bodies of U.S. troops killed in the sinking Saturday of an
Israeli ferry. The other bodies were being flown back to the United
States today, after a memorial service on Sunday aboard the USS
Saratoga. The ferry that capsized had been bringing troops back to
the aircraft carrier following shore leave.
   U.S. troops planned a low-key Christmas in Moslem Saudi Arabia,
with non-religious Christmas carols favored on Armed Forces radio
and two-foot plastic trees sent from home discreetly displayed
behind closed tent flaps.
   ``The sacrifices you make will never be forgotten. America is
behind you. The world is behind you and history is behind you,''
President Bush said in a Christmas message to U.S. troops worldwide
scheduled for broadcast today.
   Bush was meeting today with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who
ended a five-day trip to the Middle East on Sunday.
   Cheney declined to say whether the United States has a timetable
to attack Iraqi forces if Saddam ignores a U.N.-imposed Jan. 15
deadline to quit Kuwait. Last week, Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller
said American ground forces would not be ready for combat until
about a month after the deadline.
   But Cheney said on Sunday, ``We would be prepared today, if we
were ordered today, to take military action.''
   Britain's defense secretary, Tom King, told the British
Broadcasting Corp. today that Iraq would be ``very severely
beaten'' if war breaks out in the gulf. ``There will be no question
about the outcome,'' King said.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, was quoted in The Los
Angeles Times today as saying that Iraqi officials were still
willing to meet for talks with the Bush administration on Jan. 12.
   Bush has rejected any date later than Jan. 3 as too close to the
U.N. deadline for Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit
Baghdad as offered.
   In other developments:
   -Conservative Soviet lawmakers submitted a resolution to the
parliament today demanding daily government briefings on the
Persian Gulf crisis and a vote before any Soviet troops are sent to
the region. The resolution, put forward by Col. Viktor Alksnis on
behalf of the hard-line Soyuz faction, also asks a special
legislative session held on the topic Jan. 14, the day before the
U.N. deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal.
   -Representatives of a Nobel Peace Prize-winning group of
physicians said the trade embargo against Iraq has gone too far,
causing the infant mortality rate there to double. Dr. John
Pastore, secretary of the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War, called the embargo ``inhumane.'' The
embargo allows for humanitarian shipments, and diplomats and some
doctors in Baghdad have said there was no shortage of basic food
and medicines.
   -The Saudis angered French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement by refusing to allow a French rock 'n' roll star to
perform for troops camped in the desert, the French Embassy said.
Eddy ``Schmoll'' Mitchell's 1950s-style music apparently offends
country's strict Moslem tenets. The spokesman said Chevenement
canceled a meeting with his Saudi counterpart in protest.

<HEAD>Pentagon Shipping Costs Soar As Persian Gulf Demands Grow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The increased demand for shipping to the
Middle East brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis has caused
shipping costs paid by the Pentagon to soar, military and industry
sources said today.
   ``We walk with big feet in the market,'' Margaret B. Holtz, a
spokeswoman for the Navy's Military Sealift Command, said. ``When
you charter the number of ships that we charter, it's going to have
an effect on the price.''
   ``Its a question of supply and demand,'' said Robert W.
Kesteloot, a shipping consultant in Reston, Va., who retired in
1986 after six years as the Navy's director of strategic sealift.
   ``The shippers run a great risk if they accept cargo going out
there,'' Kesteloot said.
   He said that if shippers displace other cargo to take on the
military loads, they may not get the other customers back after the
crisis in the gulf is over.
   Kesteloot said he knew of charter ships that were now bringing
in more than 50 percent more than they could demand six months ago.
   He said container rates have also risen sharply.
   The New York Times, in an article published today, said the Navy
has been paying nearly $8,000 for each standard 40-by-8-by 8
1/2-foot steel container used to send supplies to the gulf from the
East Coast. The Times said this is twice what some commercial
shippers now pay.
   The newspaper also said that the sealift command was paying
$7,000 to $8,500 a day to charter medium-sized multi-deck
freighters that brought $6,000 to $6,500 a day last summer.
   Ms. Holtz said she could not comment on the figures, which the
Times obtained from industry sources. Brokerage and shipping
offices contacted for confirmation were closed for the Christmas
holiday.
   In a statement supplied to The Times, Vice Adm. Francis R.
Donovan, the commander of the Military Sealift Command, said the
rates being paid ``were not particularly high in light of the
short-term requirement, diversion of ships from commercial
employment and uncertain condition in the Middle East.''

   The Congress of People's Deputies today endorsed
the concept of a new Union Treaty designed to hold the 15 republics
together, and it voted to keep the word ``socialist'' in the
country's name.
   The 2,250-member Congress endorsed the idea of preserving the
Soviet Union as a federation of equal, sovereign states,
guaranteeing the rights of all nationalities.
   The treaty must still be approved by the republics'
legislatures.
   In the 1,365-to-189 vote with 170 abstentions, the deputies also
agreed to retain the name Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
   A legislative committee had proposed changing the name to the
``Union of Sovereign Republics'' to reflect the republics' growing
autonomy.
   The Soviet Congress also gave a vague, general endorsement to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposed changes in the structure
of government. Constitutional amendments are needed to be approved
by the Congress before the changes can be put into effect.
   The resolution did not spell out Gorbachev's proposals, which
include creating a Federation Council made up of leaders of the
republics, a national Security Council and a vice presidency.
   Lawmakers also approved a resolution requiring all state
enterprises to sign agreements to provide the government with at
least the same level of supplies in the first quarter of 1991 they
provided in the first quarter of 1990.
   ``Economic relations between regions and enterprises are being
cut. the relationship between goods and money is being broken ...,
inflation is rising, prices are going up, the provision of
foodstuffs and industrial goods to the population is sharply
worsening, crime is growing and the standard of living is
falling,'' the resolution said.
   Earlier, Alexander Zhuravlev, a deputy from the Byelorussian
capital, Minsk, set off a raucous debate by suggesting that the
country call itself simply ``Russia.''
   Zhuravlev said ``our fatherland is Russian, and so I propose
that we call ourselves as we did in the past, Russia.''
   His suggestion was greeted by a chorus of hisses in the Kremlin
meeting.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak proposed instead that the
Congress adopt the name favored by the late Nobel Prize winning
dissident Andrei Sakharov: ``The Union of Soviet Republics of
Europe and Asia.''
   Other delegates chipped in with ``Union of Soviet Republics''
and ``The Treaty Between Russia and Its Colonies.''
   Congress Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov cut off the debate, telling
the deputies to ``put your emotion back in your pocket.''
   In a second, non-binding measure, the Congress voted 1,491 to 88
with 141 abstentions to back the Union Treaty, which President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said is needed to keep the Soviet state
from breaking apart.
   The Congress, the country's highest lawmaking body, began the
second week of its session today and is expected to vote on the
constitutional amendments to strengthen Gorbachev's presidency.
   Gorbachev wants direct control over a reorganized executive
branch of government to deal with a worsening economy and a
fragmenting union.
   He also is expected to make changes in the leadership before the
end of the week is out, including naming a vice president.
   The Union Treaty, which would replace a 1922 document, would
give more economic autonomy to the republics while the central
government in Moscow retains control over foreign policy, banking,
taxation, defense, transportation and communications.
   The treaty must be adopted by the 15 republics, all of which
have have declared some form of independence or sovereignty and
seek first off to wrest economic control from central authorities.
   The Congress later voted to require every republic to hold a
referendum asking its residents whether they want to remain in a
restructured union, and to approve Gorbachev's proposal for a
national referendum on private property ownership. The Supreme
Soviet, the smaller standing legislature, was asked to draft the
precise wording of both referenda and set dates for voting.
   Gorbachev has said he'd like a vote on both issues this winter.
   The legislature of the Russian Federation, which encompasses
three-quarters of the Soviet land mass, has already approved
private property and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has said
there is no need to hold a referendum.
   On Sunday, Tass quoted Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis
as accusing the Kremlin of attempting to impose the Union Treaty on
the Baltic republic ``through threats of bloodshed and use of
violence'' and calling it essential to prepare means of
``resistance, self-defense.''
   About 1,500 people on Sunday marched in support of Eduard
Shevardnadze, who resgned Thursday as foreign minister to protest
the growing influence of hard-liners and what he said was a coming
dictatorship.
   ``Shevardnadze is with us. Gorbachev is against us.
Shevardnadze, stay with us!'' pleaded one sign, held aloft on a
broken hockey stick.

   ``We haven't put up a tree in three years,'' said Rocky
Pennington, whose two daughters, Cheryl Genzer, 25, and Lisa
Pennington, 16, were murdered Sept. 23, 1987. ``We don't have any

   To cope, Pennington and more than two dozen others met last week
for a Christmas gathering by a group called Survivors of Homicide.
   At the gathering, Jerry and Debbie Maguire sat quietly, grief
and disbelief still frozen on their faces. This will be their first
Christmas without children Justin, 14, and Sammie, 11, who were
found shot and gagged in a closet in their El Reno home on July 14.
   This also will be the first Christmas for Ken Busch without his
7-year-old daughter, Kathy, who was stabbed to death and left in a
trash bin in Yukon last February.
   Busch said he would celebrate Christmas, if only for the sake of
his two remaining children.
   ``I wish I could sleep right through this,'' Busch said. ``It's
going to be difficult, and I really want Kathy to be here. But I
have to go on for the living.''
   Judy Busch, Kathy's grandmother, acted as the group's moderator.
She founded the group Sept. 3 with the help of Robert Brown, an
Oklahoma City counselor.
   ``We need to realize we are doing all right - that we are going
to get through this,'' Mrs. Busch said. ``It's not been easy; there
are a lot of things to think about during this holiday.''
   Pennington and his wife, Charlet, are spending the holiday
season in court, ``taunted,'' Pennington says, by the legal system,
the media and the man accused of killing their daughters.
   ``We have to go into that courtroom and that creep just grins at
us, forcing us to brush past him as we walk in,'' Pennington said.
``He claims he has religion - he says God has forgiven him - but I
won't forgive him.''
   John and Bonnie Krueger's 31-year-old son, Randy, was found dead
of a gunshot to the head June 9. They suspect Randy was murdered.
   ``We're in total limbo,'' Krueger said. ``Emotionally, you just
can't cope. The family tells you to forget, but then the police ask
you to remember every little detail.''
   ``How are you supposed to forget?'' Mrs. Krueger asked. ``When I
was putting up the Christmas tree, I found Randy's first grade
pictures.''
   Family members should not forget, Brown said.
   ``Something that we do different here is that we focus on the
victims' lives prior to the murder,'' Brown said.
   ``So much of what they remember of the victim is the murder. So
much of what they are focused on is that dark day,'' he said.
``This helps them get the victim's life into perspective.''

   Fire raced through a township
outside Cape Town, killing one man and destroying 70 homes, police
said.
   The fire broke out early Sunday in Khayelitsha. The township has
been the scene of widespread political unrest, but police spokesman
Jan Calitz said there was no sign the fire was arson.
   A statement from fire officials reported the cause as ``smoking
material igniting bedding.''
   Police said the blaze started in the home of D. Mahanwana, who
was found burned to death in the shack.
   The township is home to tens of thousands of blacks, most of
whom live in ramshackle dwellings.

<HEAD>Former Times Crossword Editor Dead at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edmund Akenhead, for 18 years the editor of the
crossword puzzle in The Times of London, has died at age 77, the
newspaper reported Monday.
   Akenhead, who died Saturday, joined his family's law firm in
Newport in 1936. After war service in the Glider Pilot Regiment he
took a legal post in the Colonial Service in Dar-es-Salaam, in what
is now Tanzania, where he began setting crosswords for the
Tanganyika Standard.
   Returning to England, he became the third editor of The Times'
crossword in 1965.
   The Times's obituary said: ``He began the practice of returning
edited puzzles to their compilers with detailed reasons for his
alterations, which quickly produced a consistent standard of
excellence from his team of 10 compilers, most of whom he himself
recruited.
   ``He allowed no sloppiness of thought or expression: `As a
lawyer I cannot pass IOU as meaning debt. It is evidence of
acknowledgment of debt'; or `The dictionaries do not define okapi
as a giraffe. The fact that it is related to the giraffe does not
make it one.'''
   Akenhead retired from the Times in 1983. His coat of arms,
granted by the College of Heralds in 1989, incorporated a miniature
crossword puzzle.
   He is survived by his wife and two sons. Funeral arrangements
were not announced.

   Police on Monday said they had arrested a
Lebanese man who filed a complaint demanding the return of a lost
suitcase full of heroin.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Jamal
Dahman, 31, of Tripoli was arrested Saturday after trying to
retrieve a suitcase containing 5{ pounds of heroin from Athens
Airport's lost-and-found office.
   Dahman had lodged a formal complaint and demanded the suitcase
be returned after it was lost upon his arrival from Damascus,
Syria, on Dec. 15.
   The suitcase arrived from the Persian Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi
on Saturday, and police dogs discovered the heroin.
   According to the police spokesman, Dahman made repeated phone
calls to the airport, and police waited for him to come and pick up
the bag. The spokesman said police believed Dahman was a member of
an international drug smuggling ring.
   Dahman told police he was to deliver the bag to an unidentified
buyer in Athens, the official said.
   The heroin has a street value of $330,000.

   Santa Claus sat near the starting
cannon and a military band played Christmas carols Monday while
soldiers of the 82nd Airborne enjoyed a five-mile Jingle Bell Jog.
   The run was part of a day off that included music, volleyball, a
talent show and Christmas Eve services that were off-limits to the
media because of Saudi Arabia's strict religious laws.
   ``Christmas is where the heart is, and in the 82nd Airborne
Division, everybody's heart is in the right place,'' said the Santa
Claus, Lt. Col. Bob Murphy, 43, of Fayetteville, N.C.
   He was dressed in a Santa suit, complete with white whiskers and
black boots. He handed out razor blades, candy, Frisbees, yo-yos
and other gifts stashed in a brown garbage can liner.
   ``Sure, we'd love to be home with our loved ones, but, my gosh,
we got an important mission to do over here,'' Murphy said. ``Right
now, we're at peace. That's the reason we're here - to preserve
that peace.''
   The Army division's band, led by Chief Warrant Officer Willie
James Lockett, played ``Deck The Halls'' to entertain the troops.
   ``We're doing this so the soldier won't be lonely and think
about what it's like back in the world where he isn't,'' said
Lockett, 35, of Jacksonville, Fla., a 17-year Army veteran. ``My
Christmas tree will be up whenever I get back.
   ``If it's the year 2002, that sucker will still be up.''
   Chief Warrant Officer Ben Cooper, 30, of Monticello, Ark.,
finished first in the jog with a time of 24 minutes, 31 seconds.
Keeping busy helped keep his mind off his wife and three kids back
home.
   ``You try to stay occupied instead of sitting around moping
(and) thinking about how bad off you are,'' Cooper said.
   Capt. Michael Thomas, 30, of Trenton, N.J., ran the race wearing
a Santa's cap and a pair of Bart Simpson shorts. He's been away
from home six times in the past eight years. He even saw a bright
spot in spending Christmas in the desert.
   ``Actually, out here, we're away from the commercial side of
Christmas,'' he said. ``You have to look inside yourself to find
the real Christmas spirit.''
   Lt. Lisa Titus, 27, of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps got time
off to run the race with her husband, Greg, a captain who commands
a battery of artillery with the 82nd Airborne.
   She sat on Santa's lap but didn't make a Christmas wish.
   ``I didn't need a present because my husband's already here,''
she said.
   However, the couple left their 14-month-old son, Lance, with a
nanny back in Grand Rapids, Mich.
   ``That's probably the worst part, being separated,'' she said.
``A lot of people made a lot of sacrifices to be here. We'll make
it up when we get home.''

   He's famous for his homespun eloquence
and the puckish charm of his portraits of young Americans making
their way in the 20th century. But even Norman Rockwell
occasionally goofed.
   From an unflattering portrait of a cow's posterior to a baseball
study with the umpire looking the wrong way, works that Rockwell
banished to a drawer are getting a second look in a new exhibit at
the Norman Rockwell Museum.
   It's called ``Flops!''
   ``It was sort of as a joke the idea started,'' said curator
Maureen Hart Hennessey.
   But after it began to take shape, organizers realized the
exhibit, which takes its title from a chapter in Rockwell's
autobiography, showed a new side of the illustrator and shook up
the museum's routine.
   ``I think sometimes there's a tendency to think that we're some
kind of shrine to Rockwell and that's not true,'' she said.
   Of his own work, Rockwell wrote that sometimes he found ``I've
been molding a handful of air.''
   But some of the pictures hanging in a room of the little white
house that houses the museum hardly seem to merit Rockwell's scorn.
   ``We're not saying that these things are flops,'' Hennessey
said. Guides occasionally ask visitors if they agree with
Rockwell's assessment of his work. ``It's raised a lot of good
questions for us.''
   One piece dominates the room: a large panoramic mural of the
Soviet, British and U.S. ambassadors sitting at a session of the
U.N. Security Council. Behind them crowd about 70 figures,
representing everyone from a typical U.S. family to starving
children of the world.
   In his autobiography, ``My Adventures as an Illustrator,''
Rockwell tells of his travails with the work. He said he could not
persuade U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge to smile and couldn't
stop Soviet delegate Andrei Vishinsky from beaming.
   But eventually, wrote Rockwell, the work seemed ``empty and
pretentious.''
   For another ``flop,'' Rockwell went to the trouble of staging
baseball players Stan Musial and Joe Garagiola for a picture of a
burly umpire daintily sweeping home plate. All went well until
Rockwell realized that a real umpire would never face the pitcher,
turning his backside to the grandstand.
   One of the flops simply failed to find an audience.
   For a Saturday Evening Post cover that was supposed to be a
whodunit, Rockwell posed several famous actors, ranging from Ethel
Barrymore to Lassie. All that was visible of the victim, Van
Johnson, was a pair of legs with spats protruding from beneath a
table. Visual cues tip off the astute viewer to the method and
murderer.
   But the Post decided it just wasn't ``up to scratch,'' Rockwell
wrote. ``The movie stars kill it,'' the editors said. ``The readers
will be so busy recognizing the stars that the idea will be lost.''
   What the failed pictures may show is an artist uncomfortable
with famous subjects, Hennessey said.
   ``He says in his autobiography that he was more comfortable
staying in his own back yard and painting his neighbors,'' she
said.
   Out of a seven-decade career that produced more than 3,000
works, Rockwell spent the last 25 years of his life in Stockbridge,
immortalizing the town's picturesque New England setting and
several of its residents.
   The small exhibit of flops, which opened in November and runs
through January 1992, has been ``getting a chuckle from very
serious people,'' said museum spokeswoman Beatrice Snyder.
   Perhaps the funniest picture in the room is a calendar
illustration called Mrs. O'Leary's Cow. The cow is craning its neck
to peer at a lighted lamp within striking distance of her left hind
hoof.
   ``Turned out to be my worst failure,'' Rockwell observed in his
book. ``Not that it was a bad painting. But who wants to look at
the rear end of a cow for twelve months?''

<DATELINE>SHKODRA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chapel is simple, and the pews are
planks propped on stones. After nearly 26 years in jail in a
country he calls ``the hell of the world,'' a Christmas dream has
come true for the leader of Albania's Roman Catholics.
   For the first time since 1967, when Albania became the only
Communist state to outlaw religion, Simon Jubani and thousands of
his flock can gather to celebrate the birth of Jesus.
   Greek Orthodox believers in southern Albania have opened three
churches.
   Moslems are repairing some of the few mosques that survived
state efforts to wipe out religion. Moslems make up about 70
percent of Albanian believers; another 20 percent are Orthodox and
10 percent are Catholic.
   The miraculous change in believers' fortunes came in November,
after the ruling Communists lifted the ban on religion as part of
limited reforms in the isolated, backward land of 3.3 million
people.
   Young people in Shkodra who had dared to preserve their Catholic
faith took over this small chapel in a rundown cemetery.
   Since Nov. 4, Jubani said, Mass has been celebrated every day.
From 1,000 to 2,000 people flock daily to the chapel on the city
boulevard named for the father of Stalinist Albania, Enver Hoxha.
   Jubani was jailed eight times for nearly 26 years on charges of
propagandizing against the atheist Communism brutally imposed by
Hoxha.
   He was surprised when the government freed him in April 1989,
and he began celebrating Mass in secret in his home.
   Without the changes wrought in the Communist world by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Jubani said, he would have served
out the remaining 20 years of his last sentence.
   Asked how he survived jails in which he said at least 100 Roman
Catholic priests had died, Jubani said he was sustained by faith in
the traditional Catholicism of Shkodra.
   ``As Byzantine power could not do anything to us for 900 years,
and Ottoman power could not do anything for 500 years, so the
Communists also could do nothing to us,'' the 63-year-old priest
said with a smile. Shkodra, he said, ``is like an oasis in the
Albanian desert.''
   Shkodra is reputedly one of Europe's oldest cities, and was for
centuries a center of Catholicism. Under Hoxha, it decayed as funds
flowed south to his hometown of Gjirokaster near the Greek border.
   Reported unrest in Shkodra earlier this year - and perhaps the
influence of Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, a Shkodra native - have
led the Communists to pay more attention to Albania's third city of
about 80,000.
   But that was not sufficient to quell an explosion of popular
anger this month after Alia announced that other political parties
would be permitted after 46 years of one-party rule.
   A Hoxha statue was blown up, local Communist headquarters and
the radio station vandalized and hundreds of windows smashed before
security forces intervened.
   ``We are living in political chaos,'' said Jubani, referring to
the turmoil and hatred that could be unleashed by the Communists'
reforms.
   His chapel is a haven of humanity, and believers have given it
the spirit of Christmas.
   One carefully painted a wooden altarpiece. Another brought
Virgin Mary portraits and other artifacts Jubani said were hidden
from the Communists ``by the religious spirit always in our
hearts.''
   Other believers proudly showed a nativity scene.
   ``Albania is the hell of the world,'' Jubani said, referring to
the Communist rule of terror that he said extended even to pulling
gold from the teeth of corpses in Shkodra cemeteries.
   The Communists ``built here in Albania their kingdom of
ignorance, their kingdom of poverty, their kingdom of immorality,''
Jubani said.
   Now, the first opposition group, the Democratic Party, has asked
for his support. Jubani demanded in return that the new party
pledge to help restore all churches, schools and monasteries to
Catholics.
   Albania's believers also need Bibles and money to restore
churches that have survived 23 years as warehouses or cattle sheds.
Shkodra's Roman Catholics got back one church last week. Still to
come is the former cathedral, currently used as a sports hall
adorned with Communist slogans.
   For now, however, it is enough simply to celebrate Christ's
birth.
   ``For the first time in 23 years, there will be midnight Mass,''
Jubani said, beaming, as he bade farewell to foreign reporters.
``Merry Christmas.''

<HEAD>Maine Begins Far-reaching Bottle Recycling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine consumers will become the nation's
busiest recyclers next Monday, when the state's bottle deposit law
is expanded to include nearly all non-dairy beverage containers.
   Even though Maine residents will have to rinse, save and return
more bottles and cans than ever, they seem to be taking the new law
in stride.
   ``It will probably be more of a nuisance in a sense,'' said
Charlene Haney of Caribou. ``I suppose once you get used to it, it
will be all right.''
   Mrs. Haney said the need to reduce the mountains of throwaways
filling landfills more than justifies the extra burden. ``I
understand why they're doing this,'' she said.
   For more than a decade, Maine residents have been paying
deposits on beer and soda containers under a law designed to reduce
litter. But with the advent of the solid waste crisis, the law took
on new meaning.
   A comprehensive solid waste law expanded the ``bottle law'' to
include liquor bottles as of Jan. 1, 1990, and wine bottles on
Sept. 1, 1990. Aseptic containers, or ``juice boxes,'' were banned
in Maine as of September.
   As of Dec. 31, the bottle law will include all non-carbonated
juice containers holding a gallon or less.
   Deposits are 5 cents, except on liquor and wine bottles, which
carry a 15-cent deposit.
   Excluded are containers for milk and other dairy products,
cider, cough syrup, sauces, baby formula, soup and vinegar.
   Maine's new law, considered the nation's most expansive, will
increase by as much as 50 percent the 600 million tons of beverage
containers already in the recycling stream, according to Denise
Lord of the Maine Waste Management Agency.
   ``We're geared up for it,'' said Gary Hilliard, president of
Returnable Services Inc., whose company accepts, pays refunds and
sorts used bottles and cans before taking them to centers that
recycle plastic, metal and glass.
   Hilliard added space to his Augusta warehouse by tearing out
closets and using overhead room, but he acknowledges that he may
have to build an addition.
   Besides adding to the volume of containers being recycled and
kept out of dumps, Maine's law is also creating a new line of
business for companies such as Hilliard's.
   Juice makers are hiring those companies to pick up their brands'
containers from restaurants and other retailers and take them to
recycling centers. Beer and soda manufacturers in Maine generally
do that themselves.
   Ms. Lord said the law also has social benefits: ``We're seeing a
real increase in the number of community organizations using bottle
drives as fund-raisers.''
   Other states are watching carefully to see how Maine's law works
out, said Pat Franklin of the National Container Recycling
Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. Various
components of Maine's law have been adopted in other states, but
Maine's law is the most comprehensive, she said.
   A few kinks in the law remain to be worked out. It's not clear,
for example, whether grocers or companies hired to pick up empties
must sort containers by manufacturer.
   But that won't delay the new law, even though a ruling by the
state isn't expected until January, said John Joyce of the Maine
Grocers Association.
   The law is expected to cause some manufacturers to pull products
that sell poorly in Maine, said Joyce. Other products may disappear
briefly if manufacturers decide not to use temporary stickers while
cans and bottles are being redesigned with marks showing they are
returnable.

<HEAD>Luxury Buyers Rushing to Beat New Tax on Jan. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When H.A. Sinclaire eased his new $34,000
Christmas-red Audi 100 Quattro out of a Northern Virginia showroom
recently, he did so a few months earlier than he had planned - and
saved $400 in taxes.
   All over the country, well-to-do people like Sinclaire are
rushing to buy before the federal government begins Jan. 1 imposing
a new tax on fancy cars and other luxury items.
   ``If I can avoid paying taxes, I try,'' said Sinclaire, a
retired physician who lives in horse country around Middleburg,
Va., just outside Washington. ``I don't like how they're spending
most of my money anyway.''
   As a gathering recession compels many Americans to curtail their
purchases, some of the country's tonier establishments are noticing
a surge in spending among upper-crust shoppers eager to beat the
tax.
   The strength of the trend varies by product. But luxury-item
retailers and manufacturers hope it will help sweeten what
generally has been a lackluster buying season.
   ``Probably 30 percent of our customers are coming and saying
it's a factor in their decision,'' said Michael Sclafani, vice
president of Sovereign Motor Cars Ltd. in Brooklyn, N.Y., which
sells Mercedes-Benz's.
   Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Pat Zajac says that sales managers at
the company's 24 upscale department stores report increased
purchases of expensive furs and jewelry - both of which will be
subject to the new tax. At the firm's Dallas store recently, she
said, a man ready to buy an $11,000 fur decided to buy a $22,000
one instead when he learned of the tax savings.
   The trend is most noticeable in the automobile industry, where
new levies will drive up the price of some cars by thousands of
dollars. Independent auto analyst Susan Jacobs of Little Falls,
N.J., said top-end cars are showing increased sales in November -
with BMW and Jaguar sales up about 25 percent over October -
reversing a months-long decline.
   The swelling business is, in part, courtesy of a luxury tax in
the budget package Congress and President Bush enacted in the fall.
   Beginning Jan. 1, it slaps a 10 percent tax on the amount paid
above $30,000 for cars, $100,000 for private boats, $250,000 for
private planes, and $10,000 for jewelry and furs. The government
expects to reap $1.5 billion from the levy over the next five
years.
   The stakes are even greater for people shopping for cars that
get low gasoline mileage, which tend to be European imports. The
gas-guzzler tax, now ranging between $500 and $3,850, will be
doubled Jan. 1.
   Meanwhile, many merchants - especially auto and boat dealers -
are advertising that customers can avoid the tax by acting quickly.
   ``On January 1, the tax man will be fishing for an extra 10
percent,'' announced Hatteras Yachts of High Point, N.C., in a
recent Wall Street Journal ad.
   Hatteras' boats sell for $350,000 to $6 million. That means
someone who buys before Jan. 1 will save at least $25,000 in taxes.
   ``The type of person in a position in life to buy our product
didn't get there by taking money for granted,'' said Hatteras
marketing director Bryant Phillips.
   But not all luxury businesses are enjoying a pre-levy rush of
customers.
   Chairman Michael Roman of Jewelers of America, a trade
association representing 13,000 jewelry retailers, says his
industry's $20 billion annual income has been affected little by
purchasers hoping to save money on the tax.
   ``Most jewelry purchases are to commemorate an event, so you're
buying with your heart,'' Roman said.
   Pittsburgh, Pa., furrier Carl Herrmann said the slow economy and
the uncertainty of the Persian Gulf crisis has canceled any
business boost from buyers eager to avoid the tax.
   ``There's a three-letter word sitting over peoples' heads -
war,'' said Herrmann. As for buying before the tax is imposed, he
said, ``I haven't heard that once.''
   The nation's private aircraft makers seem barely affected by the
new tax, because about 90 percent of the 1,500 planes sold annually
will avoid the levy anyway, said James Gormley, president of the
industry's trade group.
   Planes that are used mainly for business or cost less than
$250,000 will be exempt.

   After an emotional vote to keep ``socialist'' in
the country's name, the Soviet Congress on Monday endorsed the
concept of a new Union Treaty to keep the nation from breaking
apart.
   The national parliament also voted to require every republic to
hold a referendum asking its residents whether they want to remain
in a restructured union.
   Lawmakers later approved President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal for a national referendum to decide whether to scrap
Communist ideology and allow private ownership of land.
   The 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies charged the
Supreme Soviet, the smaller standing legislature which it elects,
to draft the precise wording of both referenda and set dates for
them.
   Officials said votes on the private property referendum would be
counted separately in each republic. But it was unclear whether a
few republics could permit private property if the majority did
not.
   The legislature of the republic of Russia, which encompasses
three-quarters of the Soviet land mass, already has approved
private property. Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president and Gorbachev's
main political rival, has said there is no need for a referendum.
   Alexander Zhuravlev, a deputy from the Byelorussian capital of
Minsk, set off hisses and a raucous debate by suggesting the Soviet
Union rename itself simply ``Russia.''
   A legislative committee had proposed changing the country's name
from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the ``Union of
Sovereign Soviet Republics'' to reflect the republics' growing
autonomy.
   Urging the Congress to ``take a holy act'' the day before
Christmas, Zhuravlev said ``our fatherland is Russian, and so I
propose that we call ourselves as we did in the past: Russia.''
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak proposed instead that the
Congress adopt the name favored by the late Nobel Prize winning
dissident Andrei Sakharov: ``The Union of Soviet Republics of
Europe and Asia.''
   Other delegates chipped in with ``Union of Soviet Republics''
and ``The Treaty Between Russia and Its Colonies.''
   Congress chairman Anatoly Lukyanov cut off the heated debate,
telling the deputies to ``put your emotions back in your pockets.''
   The Congress then voted 1,365-189 with 170 abstentions to retain
the name Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
   Immediately after the vote, a delegate who did not identify
himself rose to object that it was meaningless.
   ``We have voted for socialism. But what kind of socialism?'' he
said.
   ``Stalinist socialism? Brezhnev-type socialism? Ration-card
socialism? Or Swedish socialism? No matter what we name our
country, we still need to define its economic system.''
   The deputies paid no heed to his criticism, and proceeded to
endorse the general concept of a new Union Treaty proposed by
Gorbachev to hold the independence-minded republics together in a
loose federation.
   The Congress' vote of 1,491-88 with 141 abstentions is not
binding. The treaty, which would replace the 1922 document that
formally created the Soviet Union, must be adopted by the
legislatures of the 15 republics.
   In the past year, all 15 republics have declared some form of
political independence or economic autonomy in which their laws
take precedence over national ones.
   In the referendum envisioned by the Congress, citizens across
the country will vote on the general question of whether their
republics should stay in the Soviet Union, and not on a specific
treaty.
   Republics that vote not to remain in the Soviet Union still
would not gain immediate independence. Gorbachev has insisted they
follow a complicated secession law approved last spring that
includes a waiting period of up to five years.
   Parliaments of several republics, including Georgia, Lithuania,
Latvia, Estonia and Armenia, have said they will not sign a new
Union Treaty.
   Gorbachev's proposed draft would give more economic autonomy to
the republics, while retaining a powerful central government in
Moscow with control over foreign policy, banking, taxation,
defense, transportation and communications.
   The Congress also approved a resolution on ``the state of the
union'' that included a vaguely worded, non-binding endorsement of
Gorbachev's proposed changes in the structure of government.
   Later in the week, the lawmakers are expected to consider
specific changes and constitutional amendments needed to put them
into effect. Monday's resolution did not spell out Gorbachev's
proposals, which include a national Security Council, a vice
presidency and a Federation Council made up of leaders of the
republics.

   Wilderness buffs worried about losing
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain to oil drilling
have been visiting it in record numbers - and may pose a threat of
their own to the fragile area.
   Environmentalists fear the traffic is straining resources along
the refuge's major rivers.
   Commercial operators worry that hundreds of rafters, hikers and
photographers who come to see grizzlies, caribou and untrampled
tundra each summer are running into other people, too.
   ``Rivers like the Hulahula and the Kongakut have lost some of
their wilderness character,'' said George Heim of Anchorage-based
Alaska River Adventures.
   ``You're not getting what you go up there for if you end up
sharing the river with 20 other people and jockeying for
campsites.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has received
complaints of crowding and litter from river users, has started
working on river management plans for the arctic refuge.
   It took public comment through Dec. 15 on several plans. Phil
Garrett, the assistant refuge manager, said Monday that a draft
report on the agency's proposal should be done in several months,
and a final report should be issued by the end of September 1991.
   ``It's a complicated issue,'' Garrett said. ``There are several
different alternatives and a whole host of choices for each
alternative. They range from no regulation to no access by
motorized vehicles.''
   Fish and Wildlife officials acknowledge that there may be
problems in the the refuge.
   ``When we took a look at the increase of use along selected
rivers, it became evident there was some reason for possible
concern,'' said Tom Edgerton, the agency's Fairbanks-based
recreation planner for the arctic refuge.
   He stressed that federal officials are trying to prevent
potential problems and aren't sure if higher visitor traffic
actually is damaging wilderness.
   ``I haven't seen any documentation that shows damage to wildlife
at this point, but it's one of the things that we'll be looking
at,'' said Edgerton.
   He said he has gotten reports of caribou harassed by airplanes
and of litter along the rivers.
   Since 1985, commercial recreational use on the refuge's three
major rivers - the Kongakut, Hulahula and Sheenjek - has increased
more than 500 percent, from 355 visitors to 1,794 in 1989. The
number of visitors on private backpacking, fishing or hunting trips
isn't known, Edgerton said.
   Although those numbers are tiny compared to those at many
national parks and refuges, they have a stronger impact in this
sensitive region of tundra and short growing seasons.
   ``The farther north you go, the slower it takes to recover,''
Edgerton said.
   Many of the environmental groups that oppose drilling on the
coastal plain also are calling for greater recreational
restrictions, such as keeping group sizes to six and the number of
river trips to one a week.
   ``You certainly want people to be able to get out and enjoy
their wilderness, but the downside is people can love a place to
death,'' said Sharon Sturges of the environmental goup Trustees
for Alaska.
   Some of the plans, however, would restrict access and activities
not just by commercial recreationalists but by hunters, trappers
and others who use the arctic refuge.
   Ed Grasser, a hunting guide who visits the refuge in the
off-peak months of August and September, agreed river rafters
perhaps should be restricted to ease crowding. But he said his
business shouldn't be limited unless wildlife populations are shown
to have suffered.
   ``It's public land, and as long as visitation is regulated to
the point where habitat or wildlife aren't being harmed, I don't
think it's right to prohibit people from visiting simply because a
small group of people have an aesthetic sense that they don't want
to have violated,'' Grasser said.
   ``If it's actually doing environmental damage, I sure haven't
been able to locate any. That's a vast, vast area.''
   The 19 million-acre refuge in the northeast corner of Alaska was
created by Congress in 1980, but its 1.5 million-acre coastal plain
was exempted from wilderness designation.
   The oil industry believes huge oil fields lie beneath the
coastal plain and has asked Congress to approve drilling there.

<HEAD>Mandela Delivers Holiday Message Of Hope That Apartheid Will End</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of his first free
Christmas in nearly 30 years,Nelson Mandela on Monday recalled
bleak holidays in prison and expressed hope this holiday season
will be South Africa's last under apartheid.
   In a holiday message read at his Soweto home, the African
National Congress leader noted his brethren still in prison or
exile and the political violence that has killed thousands of
people in black townships.
   ``This is a year that has been marked by moments both of hope
and despair. As it comes to its close, the message we wish to
convey ... is one of hope,'' he said.
   Mandela, 72, the ANC's deputy president, was freed in February
after 27 years in prison.
   Shortly after he spoke, ANC president Oliver Tambo met for the
first time with President F.W. de Klerk. Tambo, who ended 30 years
in exile on Dec. 13, echoed Mandela's desire that apartheid be
abolished by Christmas 1991.
   ``The South Africa so many have sacrificed so much to achieve is
in sight,'' Mandela said in his message. He urged people of all
political persuasions to ``persist in their noble efforts'' to
solve the nation's problems peacefully.
   Asked to think back on his past Christmases, Mandela recalled
his first one at the notorious Robben Island maximum-security
prison. Inmates were not allowed to have visitors, and celebration
was limited to sweets and biscuits provided by the church, he said.
   He paused, then said with a smile, ``I've never cared for sweets
in my life, but in prison I thought that they were very delectable
indeed.''
   As years went by, conditions improved. Prisoners were allowed to
order special groceries for the holiday and created their own
celebrations, he said.
   ``But that is nothing compared to what I look forward to at the
moment, when I am able to celebrate Christmas as a free man,'' said
Mandela, seated in a high-backed leather chair in his lavish Soweto
home.
   He did not mention the government or de Klerk but appeared to
direct his message at them when he said: ``Our thoughts turn to all
those others in the country who will not be with their families;
those who are still held as political detainees and prisoners.''
   The government has agreed in principle to allow thousands of
exiles to return and to free political prisoners, but the ANC has
accused it of delaying the process.
   Mandela also decried what he called the ``unacceptable campaign
of violence'' in black townships, where eight more people died over
the weekend.
   Most of the fighting involves Xhosas and other supporters of the
ANC, against backers of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
   Both sides have accused security forces of playing a part in the
unrest. Police deny the allegations.
   Mandela said a meeting between himself and Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi is crucial to peace and is ``on the cards.''
The rival black leaders have not held peace talks. This month they
declined even to walk together through Tokoza township during a
tour by political and church leaders.
   Since being freed from prison, Mandela has met frequently with
de Klerk for talks aimed at setting up formal negotiations on a new
constitution.
   Tambo met de Klerk for the first time Monday morning in
Pretoria. The meeting was not announced in advance. Mandela
mentioned it during his news conference and said no major political
issues were expected to be discussed.
   Tambo later told reporters he hoped South Africa would have a
``full recovery from apartheid'' by Christmas next year. An
Information Ministry statement said de Klerk wished Tambo continued
recovery from a severe stroke suffered in August 1989, and that
both agreed violence must end for proper negotiations to begin.

   The nation's leaders scattered across the
United States for the Christmas holidays Monday, but they're
staying in touch with each other to monitor the volatile situation
in the Persian Gulf.
   President Bush spent the day before Christmas at Camp David,
Md., being briefed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on the Gulf
crisis. U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia were on heightened alert in
case of attacks during the holiday.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, returned to the United States Sunday after a five-day trip
to Saudi Arabia to check on the readiness of roughly 300,000 U.S.
forces in the Gulf.
   A previously televised Christmas message from Bush was broadcast
to the troops on Monday.
   Bush plans to stay at the presidential retreat in the Cacoctin
Mountains 60 miles from Washington until Jan. 2. The president
gathered his family with him.
   Bush can communicate with his aides and others through a
sophisticated communications system at Camp David. The retreat is
also a short helicopter ride from the White House should the
president need to return to Washington.
   In previous years, Bush has traveled to Beeville, Texas, for an
annual turkey hunt right after Christmas but this year he canceled
the trip in part because of the Gulf crisis, aides said.
   Secretary of State James Baker has accompanied Bush on the
turkey hunt in the past. He is spending Christmas in his hometown
of Houston, Texas, the State Department said.
   Cheney, a former congressman from Wyoming, is flying to that
Western state for the holiday Monday, shortly after he finishes
briefing Bush, the Defense Department said.
   Cheney told reporters at the tail end of his trip that he was
pessimistic about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's intentions.
   ``I see no sign that Saddam Hussein intends to withdraw his
forces from Kuwait,'' the defense chief said. A U.N. resolution
authorizes the anti-Iraq coalition to use force if necessary to
push Iraq out of Kuwait if its troops have not withdrawn
voluntarily by Jan. 15.
   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle is preparing to leave on a
New Year's troop morale-boosting trip to Saudi Arabia on Dec. 29.
He returns on Jan. 2.
   For Christmas, Quayle took his wife, Marilyn, and three children
on a skiing vacation to Vail, Colo., spokesman David Beckwith said.
   A key player in the Gulf policy arena, Brent Scowcroft, the
national security advisor, planned to stay in the nation's capital
for the holidays, the White House said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, just back from a trip to
the Middle East, was vacationing in his home state of Maine. The
top Senate Democrat said Sunday he was still hopeful the Gulf
crisis could be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means.
   Congress returns Jan. 3 and is likely to begin debate on Gulf
policy then. But Mitchell said he has not set a timetable for when
the debate will take place. He said he wants to find out the status
of any diplomatic activity before lawmakers embroil themselves in
the future policy debate.

   The State Department said Monday leftist
rebels in El Salvador are planning intensive military attacks in
early 1991 as a follow-up to a nine-day Christmas truce they have
unilaterally declared.
   ``Instead of negotiating to bring peace to El Salvador in 1990,
the guerrillas have chosen to bring death and destruction to their
country and its people,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher
said.
   ``While professing to observe a truce, they are preparing for
more war,'' he said.
   He said the latest round of attacks by the FMLN rebels caused 16
civilian deaths and 108 civilian casualties. The attacks on coffee
and cotton farms, public transport, banks and other civilian
property have put many poor Salvadorans out of work.
   ``These targets have no conceivable military value,'' Boucher
said. ``As the government has made more concessions at the
bargaining table, the FMLN has stepped up violence and
militarism.''

   Christmas is a solid - and almost secular -
part of American life, but it had to battle to establish itself in
North America. The holiday was banned in Boston in 1659 and anyone
caught feasting could be fined five shillings.
   The ban was lifted 22 years later, but two staunch Puritan
Congregationalist scholars and clerics - Increase Mather and his
son, Cotton - kept up the crusade against observing the holiday in
New England.
   Increase thought Christ probably had been born in September,
while Cotton said the occasion, in any event, hardly justified
``mad mirth.''
   No such misgivings moved the South. In Virginia, where
Anglicanism held sway, there was no doubt: Christmas was meant to
be celebrated.
   John Smith and his Virginia companies recorded that they ate
oyster, fish, meat, wild fowl and bread on Christmas day in 1608.
Smith later recorded that, ``Wherever an Englishman may be, and
whatever part of the world, he must keep Christmas with feasting
and merriment.''
   In a new book, ``Keeping Christmas: The Celebration of an
American Holiday,'' historian Philip Reed Rulon of Northern Arizona
University recounts the battle Christmas had to fight before it
``embedded itself into the marrow of the people.''
   The Christmas chasm was largely a carryover from England where,
Rulon notes, Episcopalians, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, members of
the Reformed sect and Moravians kept the holiday while Quakers,
Scotch-Irish, Methodists, Baptists, and the ``Plain Dutch'' -
Mennonites, Brethren and Amish - joined Congregationalists and
Presbyterians in rejecting Christmas.
   Christmas was something the Puritans wanted to `purify'' the
Church of England from. And the Pilgrims, founders of another
American holiday, Thanksgiving, intended to start fresh in the new
world, free of any of the Roman Catholic traditions that had been
retained by the Anglicans.
   ``The name of Christmas savors of superstition,'' Increase
Mather wrote in 1681. ``It can never be proved that Christ was born
on December 25. It is most probable that the Nativity was in
September. The New Testament allows of no stated Holy Days but the
Lord's Day.''
   Cotton took a different tack. He was willing to accept the
notion of observing the birth of Christ, but thought Christmas
should have nothing to do with merriment.
   ``Can you in your conscience think that our Holy savior is
honored by mad mirth, by long eating, by rude revelling?'' asked
Cotton.
   But even in New England, the battle was a lost cause.
   Against the iron will of the Mathers, pastor Henry Scougal
preached a Boston sermon that told the Christmas story and made the
case for celebration.
   He asked:``Can we be insensible of our happiness when angels do
so heartily congratulate it?''
   Christmas suffered a setback in the Revolutionary War. It was
associated with the defeated side - the Anglican English troops and
their American Tory sympathizers.
   But Thomas Jefferson championed separation of church and state,
and that allowed Christmas to become a festival free of both. It
was years later, Rulon says, that Baptists, Methodists and
Presbyterians ``brought the holiday back to the pulpit and pew.''

   Habitat for Humanity will celebrate its
15th anniversary next year by building 1,500 homes for the needy in
225 communities around the nation.
   Habitat said the 16-week building blitz will begin in Miami on
June 16 and end in Columbus, Ohio, with a three-day convention,
starting Sept. 26. Former President Carter, one of Habitat's
best-known volunteers, will be the keynote speaker at the meeting.
   During the anniversary project, 15 work teams will travel from
community to community, building new homes and renovating old ones,
Habitat officials said. Habitat will provide food, housing and
transportation.
   ``This will be the most exciting year in Habitat for Humanity's
history,'' said Millard Fuller, Habitat's president and co-founder.
   Fuller said the Christian housing group also plans to complete
its 10,000th home early in the year and to complete its 15,000th by
the end of the year.
   Volunteers build and renovate homes by using donated materials.
Recipients are required to work on their homes and the homes of
others. Houses are purchased on a non-profit, no-interest basis.

   His resignation will become effective in early 1991.
   Among McCormack's principal duties has been to prepare for the

frequent travel abroad.
   McCormack served as ambassador to the Organization of American
States from 1985 to 1988 and was assistant secretary for economic

   Salman Rushdie has embraced Islam and promised not
to authorize a paperback version of his controversial novel ``The
Satanic Verses,'' a group of Islamic and Egyptian officials
announced today.
   Earlier this year, Rushdie had insisted on the need for a
paperback version, but a spokeswoman for his defense committee
confirmed that the statement was genuine.
   In a statement released by Dr. Hesham el-Essawy, president of
the Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance,
Rushdie also declared that he did not agree with any statement
uttered by characters in the book that cast aspersions on Islam,
questioned the authenticity of the Koran, or rejected the divinity
of Allah.
   He also agreed not to authorize any further translations of the
work.
   Rushdie did not disavow the book, but insisted today that it was
a moral fable. All the things that Moslems found insulting, he
said, ``take place in the dream of a man who has lost his mind. He
has lost his mind because he has lost his faith.''
   In a telephone hookup with a news conference organized by
el-Essawy, Rushdie said it was up to the government of Iran to
remove the death sentence against him. ``I feel a lot safer tonight
than I felt yesterday,'' he added.
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February
1989, when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said the
writer deserved death as a blasphemer. Iran offered a $1 million
bounty for Rushdie's death.
   ``This is the way we hope that will earn Rushdie's release from
his predicament. This is how we intend to make him a free man,''
said el-Essawy.
   El-Essawy argued, as he has in the past, that Rushdie could not
be sentenced to death as an apostate because he was not a believing
Moslem.
   Now that Rushdie has embraced the faith, by ``declaring there is
no God but Allah and that Mohammed is his last prophet,'' el-Essawy
said that ``the slate is wiped clean.''
   El-Essawy characterized Rushdie as a ``convert,'' and quoted the
author as saying, ``There is no difference between Rushdie and
Islam.''
   Other British Moslems who have been prominent in the controversy
demanded more from Rushdie.
   ``It puzzles me that he hasn't gone far enough to remove the
hardback, if that's the intention. The Moslem community has been
suffering for a long time,'' said Sher Azam of the Council for
Mosques in Bradford, where the book had been publicly burned.
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on,''
Azam said.
   Iqbal Sacranie, joint convener of the UK Committee on Islamic
Affairs, said Rushdie's statement was a positive step. However,
``It seems to us that the most appropriate course of action ... is
the withdrawal from circulation of this blasphemous book.''
   Rushdie recently has come out of hiding for a television
interview, and on Dec. 5 he appeared at a London bookshop to sign
copies of his latest book, ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories.''
   Iran severed diplomatic relations with Britain over ``The
Satanic Verses'' but ties were restored in October after an
18-month break. On Dec. 9, however, Iranian Minister of Culture
Mohammad Khatami said the death sentence against Rushdie could not
be revoked.
   El-Essawy said he met with Rushdie on Friday in a secure
location.
   He said they were joined at the meeting by Dr. Mohammed Ali
Mahgoub, an Egyptian government official who heads the Supreme
Council of Scholars of Islamic Affairs; Youssef Ahmed El Sharkawy,
2nd Secretary at the Egyptian Embassy and two clergy from the
Regent's Park Mosque in London.
   According to el-Essawy, Rushdie made four points in the
statement:
   ``1. To witness that there is no God but Allah, and that
Mohammed is his last prophet.
   ``2. To declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any of the characters who
insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts aspersions upon Islam, or
upon the authenticity of the holy koran, or who rejects the
divinity of Allah.
   ``3. I undertake not to publish the paperback edition of `The
Satanic Verses' or to permit any further agreement for translations
into other languages while any risk of further offense exists.
   ``4. I will continue to work for a better understanding of Islam
in the world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the United States - and
was on the Sunday Times of London's best-seller list for nearly a
year. It has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
   Rushdie, born in Bombay and now a naturalized British citizen,
has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989.
   Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie's use of the names of the
Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and the
implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   In September 1989, a trade survey found booksellers in England
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty
percent said they would not handle it, 44 percent said they would,
according to Publishing News.
   A London newspaper, The Observer, reported last year that Viking
Penguin had decided to publish the paperback in 1990, but the
company never made any announcement.
   In January, the company said it was unlikely to announce its
plans in advance because of the security implications.

   The Bush administration put Thailand on notice
Monday that it will consider imposing retaliatory tariffs unless
the country takes steps to improve the protection of American
copyrights.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced that she had
begun an investigation into Thailand's copyright enforcement
practices.
   ``We have repeatedly expressed our strong concern to Thai
officials at all levels that the rights of U.S. copyright holders
are not adequately safeguarded,'' Hills said.
   ``Unfortunately, we have seen no improvement in Thailand's
willingness to shut down the considerable illegal copying of U.S.
movies, music, books and computer software or to ensure that U.S.
companies obtain prompt and effective redress through Thailand's
legal system,'' she said in a statement.
   The investigation was being conducted under a provision of U.S.
trade law known as Section 301 that allows America to boost tariffs
on a country's imports if the administration makes a finding that
American exports face unfair practices in another country.
   Hills acted after receiving a petition on Nov. 15 from the
Motion Picture Association of America, the International
Intellectual Property Alliance and the Recording Industry
Association of America.
   She said that her office wants to begin consultations
immediately with the Thai government in an effort to resolve the
problem.
   If those talks fail to produce an acceptable resolution of the
case, then the administration would have the power to target a list
of Thai exports to the United States for higher tariffs.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth suspicious fire in this small
town since Aug. 25 damaged a vacant turn-of-the-century hotel for
the second time.
   The three-story Alpine Hotel was heavily damaged Saturday night
when fire broke out on its top floor. Authorities said the 40-room
hotel was slightly damaged by fire last month.
   The Upland Terrace, another vacant hotel, was destroyed Aug. 25,
and the vacant carriage house of another hotel and a vacant
apartment building also have been destroyed since then.
   ``They're all arson. We're sure of that,'' said Howard Keach
Jr., chairman of the selectmen in the town of 1,800. He said four
of the fires occurred on Saturdays at about 9 p.m., and the other
on a Sunday at the same time.
   The hotels once were used by Hassidic Jews, who have been coming
from the New York area for years to vacation in Bethlehem, but
Keach said that appeared to have nothing to do with the fires.
   Bethlehem is about 15 miles southwest of Jefferson, which was
hit by 26 arsons during six months in 1988. A former Jefferson
firefighter was arrested, but a Superior Court jury acquitted him
in June 1989.

   Here are Monday's developments in the Persian Gulf crisis:
   ---
   Saddam Hussein said in a Spanish television interview that
Israel will be Iraq's first target if war breaks out. The Iraqi
president was quoted as saying Tel Aviv would be targeted whether
or not Israel joined an international war effort against Iraq.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir responded to the reported
threat by telling Israel radio that Iraq ``will be harmed in a most
serious way'' if it attacks Israel.
   ---
   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
Israel's most implacable enemy, indicated in an interview that the
PLO would side with Saddam if war broke out.
   ``We have coordinated our plans to fight with Iraq in one
trench,'' PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's chief political adviser,
Hani Al-Hassan, told the Iraqi daily newspaper Al-Jumhuriya.
   ---
   The readiness of U.S. forces to fight was the topic as Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney met with President Bush. Cheney, returning a
day earlier from a five-day trip to the Middle East, said American
troops would be ``prepared today, if we were ordered today, to take
military action.''
   ---
   The Iraqi Embassy in Washington said the Iraqi envoy to the
United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, and Baghdad's envoy to the United
Nations, Abdul Al-Anbari, were among those summoned home. Iraqi
envoys to a number of European nations were also recalled for
talks, officials said. It was unclear how many were involved, and
no details about the talks were disclosed.
   ---
   U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf were on heightened alert to
guard against possible terrorist attacks during the holiday season,
said a military source. U.S. troops planned a low-key Christmas in
Moslem Saudi Arabia, with non-religious Christmas carols favored on
Armed Forces radio and plastic Christmas trees discreetly displayed
behind closed tent flaps.
   ---
   President Bush taped a Christmas message to be broadcast to U.S.
troops worldwide. ``The sacrifices you make will never be
forgotten. America is behind you. The world is behind you and
history is behind you,'' the president said in the message.
   ---
   Conservative Soviet lawmakers submitted a resolution to the
parliament demanding a vote before any Soviet troops are sent to
the region. The resolution seeks a special legislative session held
on the topic Jan. 14, the day before the U.N. deadline for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.

<HEAD>Calif. High Court Upholds Most of Anti-Crime Initiative</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court today struck down
part of an anti-crime initiative that would have stripped
California defendants of any rights that are not provided in the
U.S. Constitution.
   The court upheld most of Proposition 115, the so-called ``Speedy
Trial'' initiative, but struck down its broadest provision, a
repeal of independent state constitutional rights for criminal
defendants.
   The court ruled unanimously that the constitutional provision
was such a fundamental change that it amounted to a ``revision'' of
the state Constitution, which cannot be done by initiative.
   The provision would have required California courts to follow
U.S. Supreme Court rulings in applying a long list of
constitutional rights, rather than more liberal rulings based on
the state constitution.
   But the court voted 6-1 to uphold the rest of the measure, which
was passed by voters in June and contained numerous provisions
aimed at shortening trial and pretrial proceedings.
   They included measures to reduce the length of preliminary
hearings, which can stretch for months and even years in
California; eliminating preliminary hearings after a grand jury
indictment; requiring judges rather than lawyers to question
jurors; and requiring defense lawyers to be prepared for trial in
60 days.
   The measure also expands the death penalty, allows 16-year-olds
convicted of capital murder to be sentenced to life without parole,
and establishes penalties for a newly defined crime of torture.
   In the opinion, by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, the court
rejected the provision would have required state courts to follow
U.S. Supreme Court rulings in such areas as equal protection, due
process, assistance of counsel, speedy trial, unreasonable
searches, privacy, self-incrimination, double jeopardy and cruel
and unusual punishment.
   California courts have interpreted many of those rights more
broadly than federal courts. For example, state courts have
construed privacy rights to limit police surveillance and have
ruled some non-capital sentences to be cruel and unusual
punishment.
   In finding the proposed change to be a constitutional revision
rather than an amendment - the first such ruling since 1948 - the
court noted Proposition 115 would have stripped state courts of the
power to interpret fundamental defendants' rights.
   The only justice to vote against the majority ruling, Stanley
Mosk, argued that the whole initiative should be thrown out, saying
its elements were so diverse that the measure violated the rule
limiting initiatives to a single subject.

<HEAD>Matriarch of San Diego Zoo Elephant Herd Euthanized After Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 51-year-old elephant at the San Diego Zoo had
to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling
headfirst into a concrete moat, officials said.
   Maya, an Asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo,
apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs Sunday as she tried
to climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure, said zoo
spokesman Jeff Jouett.
   Veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when Maya was
unable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids,
painkillers and steroids.
   ``I counted 27 people there trying to help,'' Jouett said.
``When she would try to rock and stand up, there was a lot of
calling and urging to her.''
   Elephants cannot convalesce while sitting or lying down because
their weight exerts life-threatening pressure on their lungs,
Jouett said.
   Jouett said 51 is fairly elderly for an elephant, but they have
been known to live into their 60s in captivity.
   Maya, who was captured in India and brought to the zoo Nov. 8,
1941, was bumped into the moat by another elephant. Two nearby
keepers didn't see the fall but heard the commotion.
   The 7,100-pound elephant was walking without difficulty in the
moat, but she apparently crippled herself while trying to climb out
on bales of hay that zookeepers set up like steps, Jouett said.
   Maya then was fitted with a harness and lifted by crane into a
sitting position. But it was evident when workers tried to get her
to stand that her legs wouldn't support her, and she was then put
to death.
   Elephants have been knocked into the moat before without
suffering serious injury, but Jouett said Maya's age may have made
her accident worse. Tests after her death showed she suffered from
degenerative arthritis in her legs.
   He described her as a generally calm, easygoing creature, but
one who often would assert herself to show she still led the herd.
   ``There's some concern over how the remaining four elephants
will react,'' Jouett said. ``They'll notice she's gone and I'm sure
it will be upsetting to them.''
   After the accident, the zoo's Elephant Mesa was closed to the
public for the rest of the day.

   He's bug-eyed, missing two fingers and has no
chin, but Bart J. Simpson has what it takes to capture
Entertainment Weekly's Entertainer of the Year title.
   The folk anti-hero who was a virtual unknown just one year ago
became an underachiever for the ages in 1990. He's got his own TV
show, Butterfinger candy advertising contract, a record album and a
``Do the Bartman'' rock video.
   Entertainment Weekly said Bart also deserves credit for not
catching typical Hollywood afflictions: He didn't punch out any
paparazzi, wear glasses to make himself look smarter, harangue his
fans about flavor-of-the-month political causes, make a trip to the
Betty Ford Center or sing the National Anthem.
   Entertainment Weekly runners-up for the entertainer of the year
trophy included Julia Roberts, Madonna, Arnold Schwarzenegger, M.C.
Hammer, Stephen King, Sean Connery, Arsenio Hall, David Lynch and
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

   NEW YORK (AP) - M.C. Hammer, President Bush, Saddam Hussein,
Sinead O'Connor and Bart Simpson might not appear to have a lot in
common. But People magazine includes each of them in its list of
the most intriguing people of 1990.
   The magazine blames Saddam for bringing the world to the brink
of war. It says Bush's place is history is insecure as he faces his
toughest crisis.
   It credits Hammer with bringing showbiz flash and footwork to
rap. And O'Connor? She's a ``haunting rebel voice heard in an age
of flashing legs and lip sync.'' As for Bart, People says he gave
underachievers a good name.
   It calls Julia Roberts the first new female star of the '90s for
her role in ``Pretty Woman,'' while crediting Ken Burns, the
producer of the 11-hour ``Civil War'' with making a name for
himself through public television.
   Also named were Patrick Swayze, Francis Ford Coppola, Delta
Burke, Michael Ovitz, Nancy Cruzan, Gen. Colin Powell, Fidel
Castro, Effi Barry, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Nancy Ziegenmeyer, Nelson
Mandela, Neil Bush, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Claudia Schiffer, William
Styron, Laura Palmer, Bo Jackson and Princess Caroline.

   LONDON (AP) - Playwright Tom Stoppard and his wife, Miriam, are
separating, they announced Monday.
   The law firm of Harbottle and Lewis, in a statement to the
British news agency Press Association, said: ``Tom and Miriam
Stoppard, who have amicably maintained separate residences for some
time past, announced today that they have agreed on a legal
separation.''
   Stoppard and his wife, both 53, have been married 18 years and
have two sons. Stoppard has two other sons by a previous marriage.
   Miriam Stoppard, a medical doctor, writes an advice column in

   ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) - Arnold Schwarzenegger's new film,
``Kindergarten Cop,'' has been flunked at the Astoria school where
much of the movie was made.
   After previewing the film, Astor Elementary School Principal
Judy Bigby and Astoria School District Superintendent Len Carpenter
dropped plans to take all the children from Astor School to a
special showing of the movie Jan. 9.
   Bigby said the film, rated PG-13, included unnecessary nudity,
excessive violence and bad language, making it inappropriate to
show as a school function.
   Dozens of Astor Elementary School children appear in the movie
as does their school, spruced up by Universal Studios.
   Universal Studios was closed Monday and studio officials could
not be reached for comment.
   At Astoria's Liberty Theater, where the movie is playing,
manager Glen Schaefer said he was disappointed that the movie
included material unsuitable for the youngsters who appear in it.
However, he said the reaction from viewers has been generally
favorable.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ron Silver is out and his understudy, Tom
McGowan, is the new star, at least for the moment, of ``La Bete,''
a new Broadway-bound comedy that will open Wednesday at the Wilbur
Theater in Boston.
   Gary Springer, a spokesman for the show, called Silver's
departure ``amicable,'' saying that the actor's withdrawal was due
to ``irreconcilable interpretive differences.''
   Whether McGowan will have the role when the play opens in New
York was not certain. ``Everything is still under discussion,''
Nance Movsesian, a Boston spokeswoman for the production, said
Monday.
   The play, written by David Hirson and directed by Richard Jones,
is set on the 17th century estate of a French prince whose court is
disrupted by a manic troubadour.
   The play is still scheduled to open Jan. 31 at the Eugene
O'Neill Theater in New York. The producers are Stuart Ostrow and
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

   Under the watchful eyes of
Israeli soldiers, the Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem came to
this biblical town Monday to open the Christmas season in the Holy
Land.
   Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded Bethlehem as a
procession of white-robed priests led the patriarch, Michel Sabah,
into the Church of the Nativity, built over a grotto where
tradition holds that Christ was born.
   Sabah's midnight Mass in the neighboring St. Catherine's Church
opened a holiday season in the Holy Land featuring three
celebrations of Christ's birth. The others are the Greek Orthodox
Christmas on Jan. 7 and the Armenian Orthodox celebrtion on Jan.
19.
   In past years, Bethlehem's Manger Square would have been crowded
and ablaze with lights, but this year only a few dozen tourists
wandered through Manger Square on Christmas Eve. Most visitors were
scared away by the Persian Gulf crisis and the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Father Wally Anthony, a Catholic priest from Flint, Mich., now
with the church in Rome, noted the lack of tourists and the
abundance of heavily armed police and soldiers.
   ``Sometimes when you read the scriptures, you read about the
soldiers there in the times of 2,000 years ago, and you can
identify with that same kind of environment,'' he said.
   As in the past three years, Palestinian town officials canceled
Christmas celebrations. The town had few decorations for the
holiday, and stores and restaurants were closed by a strike called
by uprising leaders.
   The Israeli government sponsored a holiday choir concert, but
this year only one foreign choir, from the First United Methodist
Church of Oklahoma City, took part.
   Most color on the drab, rainy day came from the red, purple,
black and green berets of the Israeli security forces.
   Soldiers and police guarded the five miles of roadway from
Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and hundreds stood around the square. All
visitors to Manger Square had to pass through metal detectors.
   Armed soldiers watched from atop the Church of the Nativity.
   Security was especially heavy because of a wave of stabbing
attacks on Israelis by Arabs following the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riot
in which Israeli police killed 17 Palestinians. Army curfews kept
15,000 Arabs at home in three nearby refugee camps.
   Gabriele Beitz, a tourist from Heidelberg, Germany, was visiting
with her husband and 11-year-old daughter, and said she found the
situation in Bethlehem ``very, very fearful.''
   ``We are very depressed about the place and about the whole
political situation here,'' she said. ``For us, Christmas is an
event of peace, and here you cannot feel peace.''
   In Manger Square, Sabah was greeted by the Israeli military
governor of Bethlehem, Dudu Mufaz, in a tradition that extends back
to the 19th century when Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Turks.
   Sabah, the first Palestinian to head the Roman Catholic Church
in the Holy Land, wore purple robes. He was led by hundreds of
altar boys carrying candles as he went to pray in the grotto.
   As a holiday gesture, the military announced it was releasing
217 Palestinian prisoners arrested during the uprising.
   Bethlehem's Palestinian mayor, Elias Freij, told reporters he
was praying for ``peace on earth and good will toward all people,
and peace in the Holy Land between Israelis and Palestinians, and
peace amongst all the Arabs.''
   Freij blamed the lack of tourists on U.S. State Department
warnings for Americans not to travel to the Middle East.
   The 25,000-strong Arab Christian community of Nazareth,
meanwhile, opened Christmas celebrations Monday with a traditional
parade through the Galilee town. Boy scouts from the town's
different religious communities led the march along a 1.2-mile
route to the Roman Catholic Basilica of the Annunciation.

   The State Department dismissed as ``unfounded
and inaccurate'' on Monday allegations by the Soviet KGB chairman
that Western countries are attempting to weaken and subvert the
Soviet system under the guise of offering assistance.
   ``We are concerned that such a senior Soviet official would turn
to this kind of outdated and inflammatory rhetoric, which can only
be described as inconsistent with the improvement that has taken
place in both the substance and the atmosphere of U.S.-Soviet
relations,'' deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   On Saturday, KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov gave a speech to
the Soviet Congress in which he warned that closer Soviet links to
the West posed hidden dangers for his country.
   ``There are attempts from abroad to exert overt and covert
pressure on the Soviet Union and to impose doubtful ideas and plans
to pull the country out of the difficult situation,'' Kryuchkov
said.
   ``All these efforts often screen a desire to strengthen not so
much us but their own position in our country.'' Specifically, he
accused the West of stimulating a brain drain and of sending
contaminated grain.
   In reply, Boucher said, ``The allegations made the KGB chairman
are completely unfounded and inaccurate ... The Soviet Union's
internal difficulties, as senior Soviet officials themselves have
readily admitted, are the result of policies adopted in the past by
the country's leaders. They can only be solved with fundamental
political and economic reforms.''
   Kryuchkov's speech occurred nine days after President Bush
approved U.S. credit guarantees for Soviet purchases of up to $1
billion in American commodities. He also proposed other ways of
helping the Soviets head off economic collapse, including expertise
in food distribution. In addition, he waived legislative
restrictions on Soviet access to U.S. government credit programs.
   Bush said U.S. policy is to ``help the Soviet Union stay the
course of democracy and to undertake market reforms.''
   Germany and other West European nations along with Japan also
are sending food to the Soviets to help overcome growing shortages.
   Kryuchkov also generated concern here in his speech when he said
that bloodshed may be required to restore order to the Soviet
Union.
   Senate Majority leader George Mitchell, D-Me., said Sunday a
Soviet crackdown along the lines threatened by Kryuchkov could lead
to a cutoff of U.S. assistance to the Soviets.
   ``I don't think we should be providing any assistance if there
is a crackdown and a return to authoritarian rule,'' Mitchell said.

   A new ban on profanity has brought this
reaction from the American Civil Liberties Union: good luck in
making it stick.
   ``They're flirting with danger,'' state ACLU Executive Director
John Roberts said of the ordinance approved on Dec. 17. The
ordinance forbids obscene or profane language in any public place
and outlaws loitering. Violators could be fined $100.
   ``All I can say is with the language people use today, they
better be ready to fill their jails up,'' Roberts said.
   That doesn't deter Mayor James A. Sheets.
   ``I come out of this building after work ever night, and I have
to listen to this profanity and vulgarity being screamed from one
side of Hancock Street to the other,'' Sheets said.
   ``People in the city have a right to expect that they can bring
their families downtown and not be subjected to the kind of
profanity I've been hearing.''
   Council President Theodore DeCristofaro, a supporter of the
ordinance, said most reactions he's heard have been favorable.
   ``Yes this will be difficult to enforce, but it's worth it,'' he
said.
   Sheets said the ordinance is part of his program to revitalize
Quincy Square.
   Asked if the ordinance violates the First Amendment, Sheets
invited a challenge.
   Roberts said the ACLU had no immediate plans to do so.

<HEAD>Special Investigator Orders Papandreou to Testify in Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special investigator on Monday issued a
warrant ordering former Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou to
testify in connection with a $210 million bank embezzlement
scandal.
   But legal sources said Papandreou would not be arrested if he
did not comply. They said the warrant was a formality allowing
investigator Spyros Spyrou to close his inquiry before handing it
to a special court.
   Papandreou, who governed from 1981 to 1989 and heads the
opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement, last month refused to
testify. He says his indictment by Parliament last year is the work
of his political rivals.
   On Monday, his party said the warrant ``offers itself to obvious
political exploitation by those who consider the process of a
`cleanup' an exercise in political persecution and the elimination
of their political rivals.''
   Spyrou said last week that Papandreou's refusal to testify left
the former premier in contempt of court, media reported.
   The warrant issued Monday ordered that Papandreou be forced to
testify. Such warrants usually lead to a witness or a suspect being
arrested if he does not comply.
   Vyron Polydoras, spokesman for the conservative leadership, said
the government had nothing to do with the warrant. He said it was
probably only a formality.
   A conservative-Communist coalition government indicted
Papandreou and four senior Cabinet ministers in 1989 on charges of
authorizing and participating in an embezzlement scandal involving
the privately owned Bank of Crete. Their trial date has not been
set.
   Two conservative parliamentarians and a leftist lawmaker are
acting as prosecutors in the case.
   For the warrant to be carried out, they must agree unanimously.
But one said in an interview published Monday in the Athens
newspaper Eleftherotypia that he did not support the warrant.
   Asked whether he thought the warrant would be carried out, Nikos
Galanos of the Coalition of the Left and Progress said, ``I
consider it implausible.''

<TEXT>
   Fellow authors supported Salman Rushdie on
Monday but worried about their profession after he promised not to
authorize a paperback version of his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February
1989, when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said the
writer deserved death as a blasphemer and Iran offered a $1 million
bounty.
   His decision not to bring out a paperback edition, and not to
authorize any more translations, was announced Monday in London.
   Novelist Hilma Wolitzer said she was ``very sympathetic with a
man who wants his life back.''
   ``I'm very sad about the tyranny that made him have to go into
hiding and that makes him withdraw his book. The freedom to write
has been diminished,'' she said.
   Faith Sale, a book editor and co-chair of the Freedom to Write
Committee of PEN, the writer's organization, said the author's
decision on paperbacks does not change the novel.
   ``What he wrote stands. But if there is some way that he can
regain his life as a normal human being, I have to support it,''
said Sale, an acquaintance of Rushdie.
   ``This was one of the most horrendous things that's ever been
visited on a writer,'' she added. ``Pragmatism has to prevail here.
It's unfortunate if the publishing arrangements have to be
affected, but he's already managed to reach an extremely wide
audience with that book.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the United States. It
has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more than 20
countries.
   Phones went unanswered Monday at offices of Viking-Penguin,
Rushdie's U.S. publisher, and its lawyer. Most publishing houses
were closed until after Christmas.
   Novelist Allan Gurganus said by telephone from Chapel Hill,
N.C., that the Rushdie episode has been a setback for writers ``at
a time when the First Amendment is under siege from every
quarter.''
   ``Since every minority group has a subject that they find taboo,
to allow any group to exercise suppression is to suppress every
subject, since there is a group waiting to be offended by every
interesting subject,'' Gurganus said.
   ``It's easy to judge Rushdie in the abstract,'' he said. ``My
sense is that if you're going to hide forever, you might as well
hide for a reason. But I can't second-guess his motivation. The
truth is always unpopular in some ways.''

   Christmas isn't just Christmas for Vera Wilcox.
It's also the birthday of her daughter, Terry Ann. And daughter
Jean Marie. And daughter Karen Loraine.
   All were born on Dec. 25 - of 1951, 1954 and 1960, respectively.
And now there's news from the youngest, Karen Loraine Hynes.
   ``She said she was pregnant and the doctor said that our 14th
grandchild was due on Christmas,'' Mrs. Wilcox said. ``I said, `Oh
my gosh, wouldn't that be something?'''
   That, Mrs. Wilcox, would be something.
   The three Christmas sisters are among Mrs. Wilcox's six
children, another of whom came tantalizingly close to a Christmas
birth. That's Mary Ellen, born Dec. 20, 1966.
   Brothers Jim (Nov. 18, 1952) and Lyle Jr. (Jan. 23, 1959) were
further off the mark.
   Some people might feel sorry for Terry, Jean and Karen. After
all, they went through childhood not only having to share their
birthdays with each other but, one might surmise, receiving gifts
on only one day a year.
   But in fact, their mother says, the sisters didn't even
celebrate their birthdays on their birthdays. They celebrated on
Mary Ellen's birthday, Dec. 20. Mrs. Wilcox said that improved the
girls' chances of getting birthday gifts as well as Christmas
gifts.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A Florida National Guard unit in Saudi Arabia
is celebrating Christmas in the desert with presents from strangers
who know what it's like to be on the front lines, far from home.
   An American Legion post adopted the 810th Military Police Co.,
and for a month the veterans worked like elves packaging batteries,
soap, razors and other items for the 160 MPs.
   With help from the ladies' auxiliary and the post office, an
estimated 400 pounds of goodies were in Saudi Arabia waiting to be
distributed Monday and Tuesday to the Tampa-based troops, scattered
across 100 miles of sandscape as part of Operation Desert Shield.
   The men and women of the 810th have already sent back a letter
of thanks. They included a poem, written by Spec. Murray N. Smith,
that reads in part:
   ``We will not be home for Christmas, Not with the ones we love.
Whiskey, rum, beer and wine, Not one of the above...
   ``I shed a tear of sorrow, I feel the twists of pain. I wish for
many things to be. I even wish for rain. ...''

   VICKSBURG, Miss. (AP) - Mary Louise Caldwell Solomon of
Vicksburg and Jessie Lee Johnson Coon of Arcadia, La., are ending a
48-year Christmas tradition this season.
   The two friends have exchanged the same Christmas card - now
yellowed and tattered - on alternate years since 1942. But this
year, Solomon received a phone call from Coon asking her to keep
the card, and not return it to Arcadia.
   ``She has been in poor health,'' Solomon said. ``She is afraid
something will happen and the card will be lost at her house.''
   Solomon said Coon does not have any children.
   ``I guess she feels like my children will keep it and cherish it
after we are all gone because they have an idea of what it has
meant to us through the years,'' Solomon said.
   The first trip for the card occurred when Coon's husband, Leo,
purchased it at Gowen Air Force Base in Boise, Idaho. It went from
the Coons to the Solomons in 1942; then from the Solomons to the
Coons in 1943.
   From then until now, the Coons and the Solomons have exchanged
the same card every Christmas.
   ``It makes me a little sad to think we won't be sending the card
any more,'' said Solomon, who has known her friend since the second
grade. ``I can understand how she must feel. We are both 76 years
old. You can't help but think about the end after a certain age.''

   MILWAUKEE (AP) - Albert Rosen has been robbed at gunpoint,
reduced to tears by critics and teased about his Jewish heritage
during the 21 years he has volunteered as a substitute worker for
Christians on Christmas.
   But neither the negative experiences nor advancing age can stop
the 72-year-old retire housewares salesman from continuing the
work that has earned him the title ``Jewish Elf.''
   Rosen relishes the idea of gift-giving at Christmas. He proudly
recounts some of the thanks he has received.
   Those he has helped tell him ``you are truly the spirit of
Christmas because you are giving of yourself rather than giving
something material that doesn't have much value anyway,'' he said.
   Rosen's efforts earned him nationwide recognition in 1977 when
NBC aired a Hallmark Christmas special about his work entitled
``Have I Got a Christmas for You.''
   But Rosen is quick to dispel thoughts that thanks and
recognition are his motives.
   ``Brotherhood should be practiced as simple as buying a cup of
coffee,'' he said. ``It should not require any recognition.''
   Rosen's volunteerism during past holiday seasons has landed him
in such jobs as a bartender, television news reporter, gas station
attendant, mail clerk, security guard and hotel bellhop.
   This year, Rosen mulled retiring as a Christmas elf. He figured
his efforts had promoted goodwill and his message had been spread.
But then his wife of 51 years, Sylvia, stepped in and changed his
mind.
   ``There's never a time when it's not important to help
someone,'' Mrs. Rosen reminded her husband.

   POMPEY, N.Y. (AP) - All Terry and Ann Christmas wanted for
Christmas was ... another Christmas.
   The suburban Syracuse couple - so named because Terry's Italian
grandfather literally translated his last name, Natale, into
English after immigrating to the United States - usually celebrates
Dec. 25 in a big way. They send their Christmas cards via
Christmas, Fla., or Christmas, Mich., for the postmark, and they
have a Christmas license plate on their car.
   But something had been missing for the Christmases.
   For the past five years, the infertile couple have been futilely
trying to adopt a healthy infant.
   But by early Saturday that miracle was completed as the
Christmases brought home a baby boy from Romania - 7-week-old Adam
Christmas.
   ``We couldn't ask for a better present,'' said Ann, 34. ``Once
we had the baby we wanted to be home by Christmas. ... I go to
church every week. I believe this was meant for us.''

   A Marine's mother has a plan to form a Christmas
Day link between U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and their families
back home using the radio and the moon.
   Anne Schiller of Chicago says she got the idea for Project
Monbeam shortly after her 21-year-old son, Brian, left for the Gulf
on Oct. 30. She said she was unable to reach him for about a week.
   ``I was so upset,'' she said. ``But I was comforted by the fact
that no matter where he was, he could look up at the same moon I
was looking at. So when I finally talked to him again I told him
that everytime he looks at the moon to let it remind him of all the
love he has from home.
   ``It really does make us both feel better,'' she said.
   Schiller says she wants friends and families of U.S. troops to
join in singing Christmas carols when the moon is visible in the
United States and in the Gulf - at 3 p.m. EST.
   ``This is such a lonely time for them,'' said Schiller, 44.
``These kids are really down, and I really think this might
brighten their spirits.''
   In case moonbeams don't transmit the families' messages to the
Gulf, the Armed Forces Radio and Television Network will air a
recording of about 200 relatives and friends of GIs overseas
humming Christmas carols.
   At the same time, about 5,000 affiliates of five U.S. radio
networks will play a recording of the same group singing carols.
Armed Forces radio will play the hummed carols so Saudis aren't
offended by the religious lyrics.
   About 80 percent of the soldiers in the desert should be able to
hear the braodcast at 11 p.m. Saudi time.
   Armed Forces radio has been advertising the simultaneous
sing-a-long and encouraging soldiers to look at the moon when it
airs, said Lt. Col. Ray Shepherd, operations officer for the Armed
Forces network, based in Alexandria, Va.
   ``Being a soldier away from home, no matter where, it's nice to
know someone's thinking about you,'' Shepherd said.

<HEAD>Rushdie Embraces Islam, Won't Seek Paperback `Satanic Verses'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie said Monday that he has embraced
Islam and has given up his push for paperback publication of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' the book which brought him a death sentence from
Iran nearly two years ago.
   He also pledged, in a statement released by a local Islamic
leader, that he would permit no further translations of the book.
   However, Rushdie defended his book as a ``moral fable'' about a
character who ``has lost his mind because he has lost his faith.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February
1989, when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him
to death for blasphemy.
   Iran offered a $1 million bounty for Rushdie's death, and
Iranian authorities reconfirmed the death sentence and the bounty
earlier this month.
   Rushdie's statement was released by Dr. Hesham el-Essawy,
president of the Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious
Tolerance. He said Rushdie typed the statement himself following a
meeting with Islamic scholars.
   In his statement, the author declared that he did ``not agree
with any statement in my novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any
of the characters who insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts
aspersions upon Islam, or upon the authenticity of the holy Koran,
or who rejects the divinity of Allah.''
   Rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference that
it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death sentence.
But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie's use of the names of
the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   El-Essawy said Rushdie now had a ``clean slate'' with the Moslem
world because he had only now professed his belief that ``there is
no God but Allah and that Mohammed is his last prophet.''
   In addition to el-Essawy, Rushdie met with two imams from the
Regent's Park Mosque - Dr. Zaki Badawi, principal of the Moslem
College in Britain and Dr. Hohammed Ali Mahgoub, Egypt's secretary
of state for endowment and head of the Supreme Council for Islamic
Affairs, as well as Yousef el-Sharkawy, second secretary at the
Egyptian Embassy.
   Rushdie's statement was welcomed by other Moslem leaders, who
nonetheless demanded that the book be withdrawn entirely from
circulation.
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on,''
said Sher Azam of the Council for Mosques in Bradford, where the
book had been publicly burned.
   Iqbal Sacranie, joint convener of the United Kingdom Committee
on Islamic Affairs, said Rushdie's statement was a positive step,
but also called for ``the withdrawal from circulation of this
blasphemous book.''
   El-Essawy argued that Rushdie could not be sentenced to death as
an apostate because he had not been a believing Moslem when he
wrote the novel.
   He characterized Rushdie as a ``convert,'' and quoted the author
as saying, ``There is no difference between Rushdie and Islam.''
   ``This is the community that is close to my heart,'' Rushdie
told the news conference. ``To come closer to it has given me a
great deal of joy.''
   He said he would not permit any further translations of the book
``while any risk of further offense exists,'' and added that he
would ``continue to work for a better understanding of Islam in the
world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
   No one was available for comment Monday at Viking Penguin,
publishers the hardback book. However, the publisher had previously
shown no enthusiasm for a paperback, a position that had drawn
criticism from Rushdie.
   If there was no paperback, he said in an interview in January
with the Independent on Sunday newspaper, ``in a few years the book
simply won't be there for anyone who wants to read it. It will, in
all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the United States - and
was on the Sunday Times of London's best-seller list for nearly a
year. It has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
   Rushdie, born in Bombay, India, and now a naturalized British
citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989. His native country
was the first to ban the book, in October 1988.
   In September 1989, a trade survey found booksellers in England
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty
percent said they would not handle it, 44 percent said they would,
according to Publishing News.

<HEAD>US Disagrees With Chinese Attack on Rights Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday rejected
charges by China's Communist Party that the United States is using
its human rights policy to subvert the Chinese system of
government.
   Responding to an editorial in the party organ People's Daily,
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States merely
wants China to live up to internationally accepted human rights
standards.
   The harsh tone f the editorial contrasted sharply with the
generally friendly reception given in Beijing last week to Richard
Schifter, the assistant secretary for human rights.
   Boucher said, ``Needless to say we disagee with its (the
People's Daily's) assessment of our human rights policy ... We
don't seek to undermine the Chinese government nor to interfere in
its internal affairs.''
   Rather, he said, the United States tries to point out to Chinese
authorities where they violate international human rights standards
and to advise China of the likely consequences in terms of U.S.
policy.
   Boucher said the United States tries ``to persuade the Chinese
government to modify its practices to conform to international
law.''
   The People's Daily editorial made sarcastic references to what
it called the U.S. ``guardians of human rights.''
   ``Everyone can see clearly that `human rights' clamored for by
these guardians have been used to suppress the masses, interfere in
others and protect the hegemony of rule by the bourgeoisie and
dollar imperialists,'' the editorial said.
   After Schifter left China last week, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman indicated a new openness to discuss rights issues.
Schifter and U.S. Embassy officials said they detected a distinct
thawing of Chinese attitudes on such questions.
   Schifter submitted to Chinese officials a list of 150 Chinese
prisoners believed held for political or religious activities, and
asked for a detailed description of their status.
   Schifter indicated that China's softer attitude suggested they
were anxious about the possibility Congress might strip some trade
benefits that China receives from the United States.
   China's economy has deteriorated, and some analysts believe the
country has become increasingly reliant on its trade with the
United States, which reportedly shows a $10 billion surplus in
China's favor.
   U.S. officials also have said that American support for Chinese
loan applications at international financial institutions is
contingent on China's human rights performance.
   Despite the evidence last week of a more flexible Chinese
attitude on human rights, Schifter said he would not recommend an
easing of the remaining sanctions on China. Those sanctions were
imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at
Tiananmen Square 18 months ago.
   Among other sanctions, the United States no longer permits large
ceremonial visits by Chinese and American delegations to each
other's capital.

   The Pentagon's top civilian and military
officers brought President Bush up to date on the tense situation
in the Persian Gulf Monday in a briefing at the president's
mountaintop retreat at Camp David.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned to Washington from a
five-day visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday and helicoptered Monday to
the camp about 60 miles north of the capital in western Maryland.
   Neither the White House nor the Defense Department gave any
details of their talks and Cheney made no comments to reporters
when he returned to the Pentagon.
   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney and Powell met with senior commanders
and some of the nearly 300,000 American troops stationed in and
around the desert kingdom.
   The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from neighboring Kuwait, which the Iraqis invaded on Aug.
2 and later annexed.
   Cheney said during his Mideast trip that the refusal of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw as the deadline draws closer
increases the likelihood of war.
   ``Each day that goes by, each week without signs of an Iraqi
withdrawal, moves us that much closer to the point at which we and
other members of the coalition may have no other choice,'' Cheney
said during a stopover Sunday in Cairo.
   In the final days of their visit, Cheney and Powell toughened
their rhetoric against Saddam, apparently to counter statements
made a U.S. military official early in the trip that American
ground forces might not be ready for comment until after the
mid-January deadline.
   ``If I were Saddam Hussein, I would take very seriously what the
president said,'' Cheney said on the flight home. ``That is that we
are deploying the military capability to implement the U.N.
resolutions and to force him out of Kuwait should that be
necessary.''
   Cheney also said during the visit, in response to a sailor's
question, that he was confident the allies ``that really count''
would not abandon the multinational military force if Iraq withdrew
only partly from Kuwait. He specifically mentioned the Saudis,
Egyptians and British.
   On the flight home, he said he was not trying to imply that
Syria and France were hedging their commitment to support their
allies.
   Both Cheney and Powell said there was no timetable for attack by
U.S. forces, which include Marines stationed 50 miles from the
Iraqi border.
   The defense secretary described the trip as ``enormously
successful'' but gave no details of his meetings, some of which
even most of his top aides were not allowed to attend.
   After his return from Camp David, Cheney left for Wyoming for a
family vacation in his home state. He is expected back in
Washington right after New Year's Day.

<HEAD>Eastern Germans Share Christmas With Soviet Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A home-cooked meal, a little gift, a tour of the
big city. On Christmas Eve, such simple gestures of good will
captured not only holiday spirit, but historic times.
   Eastern Germans opened their doors to the Soviet soldiers who
once occupied the former nation. The once-feared Red Army paid a
holiday visit, bearing not arms but good tidings.
   ``It's heart-to-heart contact, people to people,'' said Klaus
Wuest. ``The old regime was based on suspicion and hatred. Now we
can be friendly.''
   Wuest said he contacted the Soviet command last week and asked
if it would allow a Soviet soldier to spend Christmas Eve with him,
his wife, Liane, and their 5-year-old son, Willi.
   Monday morning, 19-year-old Nikolai showed up in uniform at the
door of their home in Bernau, a small city just north of Berlin.
   Nikolai, from the Ukraine city of Lvov, spoke only a little
German. The Wuests spoke no Russian. Yet they toured downtown
Berlin, lingering a bit by a large memorial to the Soviet soldiers
who died while conquering Nazi Germany.
   ``Not too long ago, neither of us could have come to this
place,'' said Wuest, a window washer.
   The memorial, a large statue of a helmeted Soviet soldier,
stands in what used to be West Berlin, a short walk from where the
Berlin Wall once kept Wuest and his countrymen under Soviet
domination.
   ``Even though Soviets lived in our city, we had very little
contact with them,'' said Wuest. ``Now we can see how hard it will
be for these young men.''
   The family members said they were concerned about the unstable
situation in the Soviet Union and they and Nikolai did not want to
reveal his last name.
   ``Even though his commander said it is OK (to join the family),
he could have a new commander tomorrow who says it's not,'' Wuest
said.
   This was one of several such meetings during the holidays. Two
nationalities with a long tradition of animosity stopped and shared
a moment as they hurtle in opposite directions.
   Eastern Germans are experiencing tough times as they move to a
radically different economic system, but they face a brighter
future as part of wealthy West Germany.
   Soviet soldiers are preparing to return to a homeland also in
turmoil. Unlike Germany, however, the Soviet Union's very existence
is uncertain.
   Earlier this month, a German friendship society, the German
Community, urged eastern Germans to invite Soviet soldiers home for
the holidays.
   The society said late last week that it had received thousands
of responses.
   Germany has been aggressive in collecting money and food to ship
to the Soviet Union to help offset dire food distribution problems
in the nation.
   Most of that aid has emanated from former West Germany, however.
   Many eastern Germans still resent the fact that the Soviet Union
imposed the Communist system on their nation and kept 360,000
troops on their soil.
   But good will does exist in eastern Germany. Brandenburg state
has sent gift packages of food to Soviet bases. News programs have
shown young soldiers, some looking a little embarrassed, accepting
them.
   The images touched the members of the Kiesov family. They are
expecting a Soviet soldier Christmas Day.
   ``Our children are grown now and I saw these young men, 18, 19,
on television,'' said Siegfried Kiesov, 58, from the town of Klein
Machnow outside Berlin. ``We had a lot of sympathy.''
   Kiesov said he was alarmed by the overt hostility toward Soviet
soldiers after East Germans threw off communism last year and began
to freely express themselves.
   ``The situation is hard, there are a lot of people with nothing
under the Christmas tree,'' he said. ``But it is harder for these
soldiers. We can be optimistic about our future, but I don't know
if they can.''

   A jury has convicted an alleged gang leader
of murder and 17 other charges for crimes committed during a spree
to celebrate his birthday.
   James Walker, 24, was found guilty Friday of premeditated
murder, aggravated kidnapping and rape in the beating death of
Roseanna Johnson. Her battered body was found in July in a park.
   Walker also was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping,
aggravated sodomy, aggravated robbery, aggravated battery, three
counts of aggravated burglary, two counts of rape, two counts of
theft, battery, attempted aggravated criminal sodomy and aggravated
assault.
   Prosecutors said Walker and some other people got drunk and went
on the crime spree to celebrate his birthday.
   Defense attorney Richard Ney had urged the jury to acquit
Walker, saying he was too drunk to know what he was doing and is
mildly retarded.
   The jury is to return Wednesday to recommend a sentence. Walker
could be sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.

   Two parolees who walked away from a
halfway house were charged Monday in the slayings of a woman and
her daughter who were shot to death during a botched burglary at a
remote mountain cabin.
   The women apparently interrupted a burglary at their cabin in
Weber Canyon, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City, where they
were staying during a holiday gathering.
   Von Lester Taylor, 25, and Edward Steven Deli, 21, each were
charged with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of
attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
   They also were charged with aggravated assault, theft, arson and
failure to heed a police signal to stop.
   Taylor and Deli are accused of killing Beth Harmon Tidwell
Potts, who was in her mid-70s and from Murray, Utah, and her
51-year-old daughter, Kay Tidwell Tiede, of Humble, Texas. The two
women died at the scene of Saturday's shooting.
   Mrs. Tiede's husband, Rolf, 51, was shot in the face and was
flown to the University of Utah Medical Center in Salt Lake City,
where he was in good condition Monday, a nursing supervisor said.
   Taylor and Deli allegedly kidnapped two daughters of the
Tiedes', ages 20 and 17. The younger women, whose names were not
released, were rescued unharmed after police forced the suspects'
car off a road during a chase, the Summit County Sheriff's
Department reported.
   The sheriff's office was notified Saturday afternoon by a caller
who reported hearing shots and seeing two men fleeing with the
sisters.
   The two-story cabin was set afire before the suspects fled,
police said.
   A deputy saw the suspects' car headed southbound and gave chase.
The pursuit lasted nearly 10 miles.
   The deputy was joined by a police officer from nearby Kamas, who
fired two shots at one of the men after he jumped out of the car
and pulled a gun, authorities said. Both shots missed the suspect,
who threw down his weapon and surrendered, authorities said. The
other suspect, who was in the car, also surrendered.
   Taylor and Deli are recent Utah State Prison parolees who had
been staying at Salt Lake City's Orange Street Community Center
until they failed to return from job hunting on Dec. 14, said Dave
Franchina, a Department of Corrections spokesman.
   He said Taylor was paroled Oct. 23 and moved to the Ogden
Community Corrections Center. He stayed there until Nov. 23, when
he transferred to the Orange Street halfway house.
   Deli was paroled Nov. 27 and went directly to the halfway house,
Franchina said.
   Deli was imprisoned Sept. 6, 1989, on a zero-to-five-years arson
sentence. Taylor was serving one to 15 years for aggravated
burglary.
   Third Circuit Judge Floyd Gowans ordered Taylor and Deli held
without bail pending a Jan. 8 preliminary hearing.

   One of five soldiers injured in a
training accident last week has died, bringing the death toll in
Operation Desert Shield to 81, the U.S. military's Central Command
announced Monday.
   The soldiers from the 3/320th Field Artillery of the 101st
Airborne Division were participating in a training exercise
Thursday when a 105mm howitzer exploded, the military said.
   One of the soldiers, who had been in a coma, died Sunday, the
military said. His name was withheld pending notification of next
of kin.
   The cause of the accident is under investigation.
   Two sailors from the aircraft carrier USS Midway also died
Sunday when their tour bus overturned on a liberty excursion, the
military's Joint Information Bureau announced Monday.
   Five other sailors were injured, two seriously, in the accident
50 miles south of al-Dhafra airbase in Abu Dhabi.
   On Saturday in the Mediterranean, a chartered Israeli ferry
carrying U.S. sailors capsized while returning to the USS Saratoga
from the Israeli port of Haifa, killing 21 sailors.

   The 21 sailors from the USS
Saratoga killed in a ferry boat accident in Israel were remembered
Monday by 500 mourners at the ship's North Florida homeport.
   ``The unanticipated tragedy in Haifa harbor has refocused us,
and the loss is immense,'' said Capt. Peter A.C. Long, commanding
officer of Mayport Naval Station. ``We grieve for them. We grieve
for their families.''
   ``Our purpose today is simple and sad - to remember and pay
tribute to our shipmates,'' Long said. ``For some of us today, we
grieve for family. For others of us, we grieve for lost shipmates
who died serving their country.''
   Loud sobbing broke out in the Mayport Naval Station Chapel as
Alicia Cuebas, a Saratoga ombudsman, read aloud the names of the 21
dead. After each name was read, a bell chimed. The chapel had been
decorated for Christmas.
   Cmdr. G.C. O'Connor, command chaplain at Mayport, said people
ask him why the accident happened at this time of year.
   ``We're on God's calendar, he's not on our calendar,'' O'Connor
told the mourners, about half of whom were dressed in Navy
uniforms.
   After the Christmas Eve service, Lt. Cmdr. Dennis E. Spangler,
another chaplain, said ``We are all grieving ... This could have
been our sons.''
   Relatives of Delwin Delgado and Philip Wilkinson, two of the
sailors killed Saturday, attended the service.
   Delgado's birthday was last Friday, O'Connor said.
   At the front of the chapel was a bouquet of red and white
flowers from the crew of the USS Lexington, a training carrier
based in Pensacola, and a wreath of yellow daisies, daffodils, and
chrysanthemums.
   At a service Sunday aboard the Saratoga, crewmen bade a tearful
farewell to their 21 comrades.
   The accident occurred as sailors returned from liberty in Haifa,
Israel. It was the deadliest accident involving U.S. servicemen in
Operation Desert Shield.
   Nineteen bodies were recovered Saturday, including six pulled by
Israeli divers from the sunken, two-deck ferry. Another was found
Sunday.
   On Monday, the Navy called off a search for one soldier whose
body was never retrieved. Aviation Ordnanceman 3rd Class Anthony J.
Fleming, 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., is presumed to have died in the
ferry accident.
   A military transport jet carrying the 20 bodies landed at Dover
Air Force Base Monday afternoon. A Navy honor guard and color guard
stood silently under a sunny sky as the bodies of their fallen
comrades arrived.
   Deputy Chief of Chaplains Rear Adm. David White said a brief
prayer.
   He said the dead sailors presented themselves before God's grace
in pursuit of peace. He quoted from the Bible: ``Blessed are the
peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God.''
   The remains will be prepared for burial at the base mortuary
before being transferred to the next of kin.
   The Saratoga task force, based at Mayport Naval Air Station in
Florida, includes the destroyer Sampson, the cruiser South Carolina
and the combat stores ship Sirius. It has a crew of 6,200 men.
   The Saratoga and its escort ships had come from the Red Sea
where they joined in the naval buildup in the Persian Gulf that
began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Two Israeli investigations and one probe by the U.S. Navy into
the ferry sinking are underway.

   U.S. soldiers, on heightened
alert against terrorist attacks, displayed their trees and sang
``Silent Night'' behind closed tent flaps in Christmas Eve
ceremonies muffled to avoid offending Moslems.
   Protestant and Roman Catholic chaplains, renamed morale officers
so as not to disturb Saudi sensitivities, began celebrating
Midnight Mass more than 12 hours early for small groups of
soldiers.
   ``We had Midnight Mass at noon,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer
2nd Class Ron Sauers, 44, of Rochester, N.Y., who dressed as Santa,
using toilet paper for a beard and wearing a red stocking cap sent
to a fellow reservist.
   `The priest had already done three Masses. You take it when you
get it.''
   He spoke at a steak barbeque with colleagues from the 301st Port
Security Unit in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   The news media were barred from all religious observances,
except on the Navy hospital ship Mercy, in international waters in
the Persian Gulf. Reporters who visited one Marine camp were told
they could not write about or photograph any religious ceremony if
they saw one, which they didn't.
   On the Mercy, Santa and his reindeer arrived before an
ecumenical service. Protestant Chaplain, Lt. Cmdr. Doug Weadick,
40, of Hornell, N.Y., said his Christmas message would concentrate
on ``being able to relinquish your life to the powers that be.''
   For many of the 280,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf, not
only was it Christmas away from home, but Christmas in an alien
culture where all religions except Islam are banned. The U.S.
military has said the religious needs of all troops will be met,
but privately.
   ``I'm pretty disgusted with it but what are you going to do,''
Coast Guardsman Bill Degnan, of Youngstown, N.Y., said as he cooked
steaks for his colleagues.
   Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Steve Roy said in Washington,
``We are conducting religious services, and they are being
conducted with regard to the sensitivities of our hosts.''
   ``I don't know that I'd classify that as secrecy,'' he said.
   For many soldiers, homesickness and anxiety were heightened by
the higher state of alert, just three weeks before the U.N. Jan. 15
deadline for Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
alert was ordered because of fears of a terrorist attack over the
Christmas holidays.
   Servicemen and women celebrated the holiday in a variety of
ways:
   -Hundreds of desert-weary soldiers boarded the cruise liner
Cunard Princess on Christmas Eve for a recreation tour. A woman
dressed as Santa Claus greeted them as they hurried up the
gangplank shortly after the ship docked off Bahrain. The Pentagon
leased the ship for six months as a floating hotel for the troops,
at a cost of $31 million.
   -In a tent in the middle of the desert, two young Navy hospital
corpsmen who sing under the name Fried Brains sang Christmas carols
for the Marine Combat Service Support Detachment 111. The songs
included ``Silver Bells,'' ``Winter Wonderland,'' and in apparent
violation of rules against singing religious songs in public,
``Silent Night.''
   -In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Bob Hope performed in a U.S.
military compound, keeping a tradition of entertaining U.S. troops
at Christmas that dates to 1941 for him. But the 87-year-old
comedian left Marie Osmond and the Pointer Sisters - part of his
show - in Bahrain, again not to offend the Saudis with women
entertainers.
   Hope's travel itinerary was not disclosed for security reasons,
but his spokesman, Frank Liberman, said on Monday that Hope and his
troupe will be performing non-stop in the Persian Gulf, hopping
from ship to sand to entertain Operation Desert Shield troops.
   Also scheduled to be in the troupe were Hope's wife Dolores,
actress Ann Jillian, country music singer Aaron Tippin, former
Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench and actress Khrystyne Haje of
the TV comedy ``Head of the Class.''
   French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement canceled a
meeting with the Saudi defense minster after the kingdom refused
to let rock star Eddy ``Schmoll'' Mitchell entertain troops in the
desert, a French Embassy spokesman said.
   For many soldiers it was just another working day, though some
had light duties and slept late. There were a few fun runs in the
desert, carol concerts and merrymaking.
   All the Navy ships had real Christmas trees and so did the Coast
Guard, sent by well-wishers from home. But out in the desert the
trees were mainly of the small, plastic variety.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Gary Kmetty, 39, of Alsip,
Ill., took a ham, sent from home, out on his patrol boat for
Christmas Eve dinner. Ham - banned by Moslems - is also on the menu
for Tuesday's Christmas dinner along with turkey and roast beef.
   ``To me, it's just another day,'' said Kmetty. ``I quit watching
the calendar.''
   At the Coast Guard barbeque, another Santa, Machinist Technician
1st Class Bob Miller from Rochester, N.Y., had an automatic rifle
slung across his shoulder instead of the usual bag of presents.
   Asked if he had a present for Saddam Hussein, Miller smiled
through his beard and said: ``I got one round in here with his name
if I ever see him.''

<HEAD>Constitutional Change Removed From California's Prop. 115</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Monday stripped
a prosecution-sponsored crime initiative of its most ambitious
provision, a narrowing of many constitutional rights in criminal
cases.
   The court ruled unanimously that a portion of Proposition 115,
approved by state voters last June, made such a fundamental change
in the structure of California government that it amounted to a
revision of the state Constitution, which cannot be done by
initiative.
   The court upheld the rest of the measure on a 6-1 vote.
   Dubbed the Speedy Trial Initiative by sponsors, Proposition 115
contained numerous changes aimed at shortening court proceedings in
criminal cases, including restrictions on pretrial hearings,
continuances and questioning of prospective jurors. It also
requires defense lawyers to disclose evidence to prosecutors before
trial.
   One provision required state courts in criminal cases to follow
U.S. Supreme Court rulings in applying a long list of
constitutional rights, many of which have been interpreted by state
courts as giving broader protection for defendants than federal
rulings.
   The court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas,
declared the constitutional changes to be a ``revision'' rather
than a valid constitutional amendment. A revision can be submitted
to voters only by the Legislature or a constitutional convention.
   California courts would lose power to interpret fundamental
rights, and ``ultimate protection of criminal defendants from
deprivation of their constitutional rights would be left in the
care of the United States Supreme Court,'' Lucas wrote.
   The ruling keeps California ``at the forefront of the movement
among state supreme courts across the country to give independent
meaning to their state constitutions,'' said Gerald Uelmen, dean of
the University of Santa Clara Law School, one of three lawyers who
filed suit against Proposition 115.
   Chief Assistant Attorney General Richard Iglehart, whose office
defended the measure, said procedural changes remaining in the
measure, such as new time limits on hearings and trial-setting and
the conduct of preliminary hearings, are already quickening the
pace of criminal cases around the state.
   Under Proposition 115, preliminary hearings, the
sometimes-lengthy sessions to determine whether a defendant should
be held for trial, are abbreviated. The hearings are eliminated
when a grand jury issues an indictment.
   The measure also requires judges rather than lawyers to question
prospective jurors; requires pretrial disclosures of evidence by
the defense, formerly required only of the prosecutor; requires
defense lawyers to be prepared for trial in 60 days;, and makes it
harder for the defense to get separate trials for multiple crimes.
   The measure also allows 16-year-olds convicted of capital murder
to be sentenced to life without parole, establishes penalties for a
newly defined crime of torture, and expands the death penalty.

   Iranian officials and Lebanese Shiite
Moslem fundamentalists have said for months that Western hostages
would be freed before the year's end, but as the days dwindle, so
do hopes.
   Five hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists were freed during
the year. But 13 remain in captivity and there is no indication
they will be released by Jan. 1.
   Hopes that all hostages might be freed this year followed
improvements in Iran's relations with the West following the death
of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in June
1989.
   American educators Robert Polhill and Frank Reed were freed 10
days apart in April. Swiss Red Cross workers Emanuel Christen and
Elio Erriquez as well as Irishman Brian Keenan were released in
August.
   That was a record for hostage releases in a single year since
1983, when Shiites launched their campaign of anti-Western
kidnappings, suicide bombings and aircraft hijackings.
   Many hoped there would be more releases ``to close the file of
the hostages by the end of 1990,'' as many Iranian and Lebanese
Shiite officials have said.
   But Hussein Musawi, reputed mentor of hostage-holding factions,
said U.S. military intervention in the Persian Gulf following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait hurt the chances for freedom for
the six remaining American hostages.
   Musawi heads a pro-Syrian wing in Hezbollah, or the Party of
God, Iran's main ally in Lebanon and the umbrella organization of
the Shiite fanatical groups holding most of the Westerners.
   The longest held is American journalist Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
on March 16, 1985.
   For Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, and fellow American hostage
Thomas Sutherland, this Christmas is their sixth in captivity.
   It is the fifth for two other Americans, Joseph Cicippio and
Edward Austin Tracy, and for British journalist John McCarthy.
   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite and American professors Alann
Steen and Jesse Turner have spent four Christmases in captivity.
   American and British relatives and friends sent Christmas
greetings for publication in Beirut newspapers, hoping the captors
would convey them to the hostages.
   The messages included one from Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, and
from his daughter Sulome, 5, whom he has never seen. She was born
four months after his abduction.
   Sulome on Monday visited for the first time her father's office
at the AP bureau in Beirut. The office has been left as it was when
Anderson, now 43, was kidnapped.
   She sat on Anderson's desk and held his telephone. His pictures
in captivity hung on a board behind her.
   ``I want to talk to daddy. I want to kiss him,'' Sulome said.
   Anderson's abduction has been claimed by Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War, believed made up of pro-Iranian Shiite zealots.
The same group claims it holds Sutherland, 59, dean of agriculture
at the American University of Beirut, who was kidnapped on June 9,
1985.
   ``I don't really have any words left,'' said Sutherland's wife,
Jean, who has continued to live on the university campus. ``I wish
them all the merriest Christmas and can't stop hoping they will be
out this year.''
   Waite, 51, disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a Beirut
hotel for a rendezvous with Anderson's and Sutherland's captors. No
group has claimed it is holding him.
   Steen, 51, and Turner, 43, were kidnapped four days later from
the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College. A
group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility.
   Cicippio, 60, of Valley Forge, Pa., was acting comptroller of
the university when he was kidnapped on Sept. 12, 1986. The
Revolutionary Justice Organization claimed responsibility for his
seizure.
   Tracy, 60, of Burlington, Vt., a writer, was abducted on Oct.
21, 1986, and the same group that seized Cicippio claimed
responsibility.
   McCarthy, 34, a London-based television journalist was kidnapped
on April 17, 1986, while driving to Beirut airport to catch a
flight for home. No group has claimed responsibility.
   Recently freed hostages Reed and Keenan said McCarthy was held
with them by Shiite captors.
   The other Western hostages in Lebanon are Italian businessman
Alberto Molinari, 71, kidnapped on Sept. 11, 1985, retired British
pilot Jack Mann, 76, and Germans Heinrich Struebig, 49, and Thomas
Kemptner, 29.
   Briton Alec Collett disappeared in 1985. A group that claimed to
be holding him released a videotape purporting to show Collett
hanged, but his death has never been confirmed.

   More than $20,000 has been donated to
survivors of a fire last weekend that killed a man and six of his
nine children, officials said Monday.
   ``It's coming in faster than we can count,'' said Tom Keilman,
chaplain for the Canton Township Police Department in Wayne County.
   ``We have conservatively at this time over $20,000 in
donations,'' he said.
   Keilman said the fund gave more than $2,000 in cash to Debbie
Dell'Orco and her three surviving children for their immediate
needs. The rest of the donations will be issued to her in a check,
he said.
   ``They've got some incredible expenses,'' he said. ``(She is)
still distraught. She seems to be doing a little better than she
was yesterday.''
   On Monday, Fire Chief Melvin Paulun said the Saturday night
blaze was still being investigated. It apparently was ignited by a
fallen Christmas tree.
   Killed in the blaze were Martin Dell'Orco, 38, and his children,
Bonnie, 12; Sara, 9; Katie, 8; twins Megan and Michael, 5, and
Robert, 4.
   Dell'Orco at first escaped the blaze, but he died after
re-entering the burning house.
   Mrs. Dell'Orco, 36, and a son, Adam, 6, escaped. Two other
children, Jimmy, 16, and Kelly, 14, were not at home.
   In addition to money, an attorney has volunteered his services
and people have offered rent-free houses and apartments, Keilman
said.
   ``People are opening their hearts and giving forth,'' he said.

   So many families offered to invite soldiers
to their homes on Christmas Day that organizers of the holiday
Adopt-a-Soldier program at Fort Sill had to start a waiting list,
an Army spokesman said Monday.
   About 400 soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 80th Field Artillery,
who can't go home because they are training for service in the
Persian Gulf, will spend the holiday with volunteer Oklahoma
families, said post spokesman Bill Orndorff.
   Brad Allen wanted to ``adopt'' four soldiers, but he's only
getting two.
   Allen said he plans to serve them a turkey dinner on Christmas
Day.
   ``I told them they were free to do whatever they wanted after
the meal. And guess what? They like football,'' Allen said. ``So
we're going to watch the games.''
   Diana Mercado, a former soldier married to one of the
battalion's drill sergeants, helped arrange the holiday
homes-away-from-homes for the soldiers earlier this month.
   ``Something needed to be done more than cookies and egg nog in
the rec room,'' she said at the time.
   Some soldiers who live in Oklahoma are being allowed to make
brief trips home for Christmas, Orndorff said. But soldiers who
live outside the state can't go home. The soldiers Allen will host
are from Texas and West Virginia.
   ``It's my understanding these are young men and women preparing
for possible duty in the Persian Gulf and they're in a situation
where they can't go home for Christmas,'' Allen said. ``Helping
them out is a way we can show our love and appreciation to them.''

   Two suspects in a Christmas Day 1985
slaying in Oregon were arrested Monday in Wyoming after people in
Missoula, where the two had been living, saw the pair's pictures on
a television crime show.
   Raymond Mitchell and Susan Peterson were wanted on charges of
murder and attempted murder in the fatal shooting of Peterson's
estranged husband and the wounding of another person five years ago
in Portland, Ore., said Missoula County Sheriff's Lt. Don Morman.
   He said Missoula authorities received two calls early Monday
from people who saw an account of the slaying on the Fox network
program ``America's Most Wanted'' late Sunday and recognized
Mitchell and Peterson. The callers said the pair had been living
under assumed names at a local trailer park.
   Deputies went to the trailer court and learned that the couple
had moved to Cheyenne, Wyo., Morman said. He said Missoula
authorities forwarded descriptions of the suspects and their
vehicle to the Laramie County Sheriff's Department in Cheyenne.
   Sheriff Rudy Restivo said his deputies found Mitchell, 34, and
Peterson, 27, living at a Cheyenne trailer park. The two were
arrested Monday without incident.
   Two children with the couple were placed in the custody of
Wyoming child-welfare authorities.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia appealed to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on Monday to withdraw his forces from
Kuwait and avert a disaster for the Iraqi people.
   Saddam would find his Persian Gulf neighbors ready for
reconciliation if he left Kuwait, Fahd said in what appeared to be
an eleventh-hour appeal to Iraq to avert war.
   ``We wish that ... (Saddam), who was to us a brother, friend and
ally, know that the curtain is not yet drawn on the scorching war
and that he ... can spare himself and his people its horror,'' Fahd
said in a statement distributed to his five allies in the Gulf
Cooperation Council, gathered in Doha for their annual summit.
   Others attending were Sultan Qaboos of Oman, and sheiks Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the
United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and Prime
Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa of Bahrain.
   Fahd advised Saddam, ``It is braver to opt for peace than for
war,'' warning him that ``you and your people would be the first
casualties of the horror of war.''
   The Saudi monarch's desert country is now site for a huge
multinational force assembled after Iraq captured Kuwait in a
lighting invasion on Aug. 2. U.S. troops comprise the greater part
of the force.
   U.S. leaders, who along with Fahd will decide whether and when
to launch a war on Iraq, have been warning Saddam the hours are
ticking away if he does not evacuate Kuwait peacefully by the Jan.
15 U.N. Security Council deadline.
   Fahd's address was made available to reporters at the news
center near the summit's hotel meeting site.
   Fhd pledged to ``put the gulf house in order,'' and urged his
allies to ``unite politically, build the gulf common market,
accelerate the pace toward economic integration, and achieve
collective defense.''
   The leaders of the richest Arab states are discussing pooling
funds to acquire sophisticated weapons to arm a unified defense
force for the region.
   Officials said the leaders also talked about establishing a
joint military industry and studied a $15 billion aid program for
Arab nations hurt by the crisis.
   The gulf leaders opened the conference Saturday seeking ways to
devise a strategy for liberating Kuwait and preventing similar
aggression in the future.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran was
invited to attend parts of the summit sessions. Qatar Foreign
Minister Mubarak al-Khater told reporters Iran would be included in
any Gulf Cooperation Council security arrangement.
   The Persian Gulf sits on two-thirds of the world's oil reserves,
with about 40 percent controlled by the desert sheikdoms.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile has indicated that after an Iraqi
withdrawal, it would discuss the oil, money and border dispute that
Saddam raised two weeks before the invasion. However, it has
insisted it would not cede any territory.

<HEAD>Damages Awarded To Families Of Pilots Killed In 1987 Mid-Air

<TEXT>
   A judge ordered the federal government
Monday to pay more than $700,000 to survivors of two pilots killed
in a mid-air collision over a suburb in 1987.
   Survivors of the four pilots killed in the Jan. 15, 1987,
collision - two in each aircraft - sued the federal government,
claiming negligence on the part of air traffic controllers at Salt
Lake International Airport. The pilots were among 10 people killed
in the accident.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Greene ruled that controllers were 51
percent responsible for the crash and that the government should
pay damages to the families of Chester Baker and Paul Lietz, pilots
of the smaller, private plane.
   Controllers are federal employees.
   Greene awarded the Baker family $387,000 and the Lietz family
$377,000. The survivors of the SkyWest pilots settled with the
government for an undisclosed amount in October.
   In a 37-page ruling, Greene said Baker and Lietz were partially
responsible because they had entered restricted airspace moments
before the crash.
   The judge also concluded the controller in charge of a SkyWest
Metroliner, which was on its final approach into the airport,
should have seen the smaller plane on the radar scope and alerted
the Metroliner.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office was closed Monday and officials could
not be reached for comment.

   A man who attacked six elderly people at the
Golden Acres Home for Jewish Aged apparently has no affiliation
with any hate groups but has emotional problems, police said.
   ``Indications are that he has a mental health history,'' said
Deputy Chief Ray Hawkins. ``He is just a drug addict who was acting
irrationally. He is a guy who, by his own admission, is a paint
sniffer and drug addict.''
   William Dudrow, 22, allegedly attacked five women and one man
with a 4-foot pipe Saturday night. He was arrested at the home and
remained in custody Monday in lieu of $40,000 bail on a burglary
charge.
   The victims of the attack ranged in age from 76 to 90. All six
were treated at Baylor University Medical Center and released,
hospital officials said.
   Police were told that Dudrow entered the nursing home by
smashing a glass door, carrying a one-inch-thick pipe in one hand
and a Bible in the other.
   Witnesses said Dudrow said, ``I'm God. Do you believe in God?''
as he walked off an elevator into a second-floor recreation area.
Witnesses said he told the group not to be afraid of him, but began
hitting people with the pipe.
   Then, Dudrow sat down and waited for police to arrive, residents
said. Police were told that he said: ``I did it. I'm sorry. I'm on
drugs. I need help.''
   Golden Acres has been open for 37 years and has 255 residents.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftist Rebels Agree to Extend Holiday Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador's leftist rebel organization
announced Monday that at the urging of the United Nations and the
Mexican government it had extended a holiday truce through Jan. 1.
   Earlier, the rebel organization had said it would suspend
operations only in San Salvador on Monday and Tuesday, and on Dec.
31 and Jan. 1.
   But a news release issued by the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, said the guerrillas would suspend all
attacks and economic sabotage in the country throughout the
eight-day period that began Monday night.
   The FMLN said it was taking this step in response to ``proposals
made by U.N. Secretary General (Javier Perez de Cuellar) ... and
the Mexican government,'' despite the ``hypocritical attitude''
adopted by El Salvador's rightist government toward the holiday
season.
   It accused President Alfredo Cristiani's administration of
talking peace during the holidays while the army was invading
guerrilla areas. ``On one hand they talk about it and on the other
they have undertaken great invasion operations in our territory,''
the news release said.
   About 800 soldiers from the Salvadoran army's elite Atlacatl
infantry battalion are leading an operation against rebels holed up
in the mountainous areas of northern Chalatenango province.
   The rebels had begun an offensive earlier this month after the
latest of a series of peace talks with Cristiani's U.S.-backed
government became deadlocked.
   The Mexican government applauded the FMLN's decision to extend
the truce, saying in a communique Monday, ``The Foreign Ministry
congratulates the Salvadoran insurgents for declaring a truce in
the desired terms.''
   The Bush administration accused the FMLN of planning to
intensify its offensive when the truce is over.
   ``Instead of negotiating to bring peace to El Salvador in 1990,
the guerrillas have chosen to bring death and destruction to their
country and its people,'' State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said in Washington. ``While professing to observe a truce,
they are preparing for more war.''
   Five Central American presidents concluded a three-day summit in
Costa Rica last week with a statement condemning the FMLN offensive
and calling for an immediate cease-fire.
   Cristiani said last week that the guerrilla's first truce
offering fell far short of what people expected. ``What the
Salvadoran people want and need are not two 2-day truces but a
definitive end to the war,'' he said.
   Maria Marta Valladares, a guerrilla commander also known as
Nidia Diaz, responded that the Salvadoran government must treat the
war's underlying problems of economic and social injustice before
the rebels will put down their guns.
   ``It does not make sense to call on us to abandon the armed
struggle as long as the causes that gave rise to the armed struggle
are not overcome,'' she said.
   The Salvadoran government had no immediate comment on the latest
truce announcment.
   Leaders of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and
Costa Rica are scheduled to meet with Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari on Jan. 10-11 to explore ways of achieving peace
in Central America through increased trade and economic
development.
   The foreign ministers of Venezuela, Colombia and Spain have been
invited to attend the summit in the southern Mexico city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.

   Albania's Communist authorities on Monday
refused a request by the country's first opposition party to
postpone elections scheduled for February, the state ATA news
agency reported.
   The new Democratic Party of Albania presented its request to the
parliamentary presidium Monday. It was turned down on the grounds
that the urgency of reforms required quick elections and the rapid
formation of a parliament, ATA reported.
   Sihat Tozaj, secretary of the parliamentary presidium, told a
representative of the Democratic Party there was ``no objective
reason to justify the postponing of elections,'' ATA reported in a
dispatch monitored in Vienna.
   He rejected opposition claims the Feb. 10 election date left the
new party insufficient time to organize against the powerful
Communists, who have ruled unchallenged for 46 years.
   The opposition sought to postpone the elections until April or
May.
   ``There are 40 days from today to February 10,'' Tozaj was
quoted as saying. Candidates are to be registered no later than 15
days prior to the elections, ``therefore the time at their disposal
is enough,'' he said.
   The opposition had no immediate reaction to the refusal.
Democratic Party spokesman Genc Pollo, reached by telephone in
Tirana, said the party might have a statement Tuesday.
   Under a new electoral law adopted last month which allows more
than one candidate to compete for the 250 parliamentary seats,
candidates must collect at least 300 signatures from eligible
voters in any voting district to run.
   The Democratic Party was founded less than two weeks ago. It
faces numerous obstacles in making its program and candidates
known.
   The Communists have used their power over official media to
limit information on the new party, meaning it must rely on word of
mouth to propagate its cause in a backward nation with poor
communications.
   The party has announced plans to publish an opposition
newspaper, but it was unclear where it would get the equipment or
funding for the project.
   Albanian President and Communist Party leader Ramiz Alia began
introducing cautious reforms this year. Student protests over
slum-like housing led two weeks ago to demands for democracy and
helped force the ruling Communists to permit the existence of other
parties.
   The Balkan nation of 3.2 million is the last in Europe to begin
reforming hard-line Communist rule.
   The Greek government charged Monday that Albanian border guards
had slain three ethnic Greeks who tried to cross into Greece.
   Government spokesman Vyron Polydoras, in a statement in Athens,
accused Albania of ``extermination in the most revolting fashion.''
   The Athens daily Eleftheros Typos claimed Monday that Albanian
border guards shot and killed three ethnic Greeks on Dec. 12. One
of the victims was decapitated and the head paraded around a
village, the newspaper said.
   The report couldn't be verified and it wasn't clear if the
victims were the ones Polydoras was talking about.
   Albanians have been trickling into Greece over recent weeks,
including 100 over the weekend, according to Greek police. Ethnic
Greeks from Albania are automatically granted asylum.

   A female lion that roamed the Ozarks for
more than two weeks was found in a cattle barn 25 miles from home,
wounded and trying to keep warm between two bales of hay.
   ``It's like an early Christmas present,'' said Kurt Falkenbach,
of Branson, owner of 2-year-old Teasha.
   The lion was hit in the face with shotgun birdshot shortly after
it escaped, Falkenbach said. Stone County authorities said no
charges would be filed against the person who shot the lion because
they had acted out of fear.
   The lion was found Sunday by the barn's owner; a birdshot pellet
was wedged in one eye.
   Falkenbach, an animal trainer, said the lion was generally in
good health but had lost 50 or 60 pounds. Teasha weighed about 250
pounds before taking flight.
   The lion had been missing since Dec. 6, when it apparently went
through a hole in the pen's 8-foot fence.
   Falkenbach said this was the second time Teasha escaped. The
first time the lion broke out to chase some dogs, but Falkenbach
was able to get the big cat back into its pen that time.

   Under the watchful eye of
Israeli soldiers, an unusually sparse crowd of worshipers
celebrated Christmas Eve at the site of Jesus' birth.
   A choir from Jerusalem sang holiday carols in Manger Square
under a light drizzle. The festivities were subdued because of
fears of violence raised by the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising and
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   German tourist Gabriele Beitz, who came with her husband and
11-year-old daughter, said the atmosphere in Bethlehem was ``very,
very fearful.''
   ``We are very depressed about the place and about the whole
political situation here,'' she said. ``For us, Christmas is an
event of peace, and here you cannot feel peace.''
   Bethlehem's Palestinian town officials canceled Christmas
celebrations in solidarity with the uprising against Israeli
occupation. Uprising leaders had distributed leaflets prohibiting
Palestinians from celebrating publicly, and ordering shops and
restaurants to close for the day.
   The town boasted few decorations.
   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabah, led a
traditional procession to Bethlehem before leading prayers at
midnight Mass in neighboring St. Catherine's Church.
   Sabah prayed for a peaceful resolution of the gulf conflict.
   Jesus ``shows u the way of love we need today on the eve of a
world war, especially under these circumstances, we need peace,''
he said in Arabic and French.
   ``Our sins will be great if we are not brothers, if our sons
from both sides are brought up in hatred and violence. We must
build justice, there must be a change.''
   About 2,000 Palestinians and European diplomats attended the
midnight Mass, which opened a holiday season in the Holy Land
featuring three celebrations of Jesus' birth. The others are the
Greek Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 7 and the Armenian Orthodox
celebration Jan. 19.
   Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded Bethlehem as white-robed
priests earlier led Sabah, the first Palestinian to head the Roman
Catholic Church in the Holy Land, into the Church of the Nativity,
built over a grotto where tradition says Jesus was born.
   Sabah, wearing purple robes, was greeted in Manger Square by the
Israeli military governor of Bethlehem, Dudu Mufaz. The tradition
dates to the 19th century, when Ottoman Turks ruled Palestine.
   Altar boys carrying candles then led Sabah to pray in the grotto
of Jesus' birth.
   This year only one foreign choir performed in Manger Square on
Christmas Eve, that of the First United Methodist Church of
Oklahoma City.
   The 19 singers wore green robes and sang ``Gloria,'' ``Silent
Night,'' and ``Oh Bethlehem,'' as people in the crowd held lit
candles.
   Nick Harris, senior pastor of the church, said not all the group
came on the trip because of menacing news from the Middle East.
   Because of the gulf crisis and the uprising, only a few dozen
tourists wandered through Manger Square during the day, though the
crowd swelled to several hundred after nightfall.
   In past years the square swarmed with people and was awash in
colorful lights. On Monday most of the color was in the red, purple
and green berets of the Israeli security forces standing guard
around the square.
   Father Wally Anthony, a Catholic priest from Flint, Mich., now
with the church in Rome, said of the scene: ``Sometimes when you
read the Scriptures, you read about the soldiers there in the times
of 2,000 years ago, and you can identify with that same kind of
environment.''
   Mayor Elias Freij, a Palestinian, told reporters he was praying
for ``peace on earth and good will toward all people, and peace in
the Holy Land between Israelis and Palestinians, and peace amongst
all the Arabs.''
   Freij blamed lack of tourists on a U.S. State Department
advisory warning Americans not to travel to the Mideast or go to
the occupied territories.
   Security was especially heavy because of a wave of Arab attacks
on Israelis after the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riot in which Israeli
police killed 17 Palestinians.
   As a Christmas gesture, the military announced it was releasing
217 Palestinian prisoners. Most had less than a month to go in
their sentences.
   But curfews kept 15,000 Arabs inside their homes in three nearby
refugee camps.
   In the nearby Hebron district, soldiers fired on two Arab
suspects who resisted detention, killing one and wounding another,
an army spokesman said.
   The slain man, not identified, was suspected of killing an Arab
woman and shooting at Israeli soldiers, the spokesman said. The
national Itim news agency said both men carried knives.
   The death raised to 779 the number of Arabs killed by Israelis
in the 3-year-old uprising. An additional 323 were slain by fellow
Arabs, most as alleged collaborators with Israel, and 57 Israelis
also have died.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II proclaimed the ``good
news'' of the birth of Christ and the wealth of the human spirit in
a Chistmas Eve Mass broadcast in 50 countries, including the Soviet
Union.
   The pope, in golden robes embroidered with black, celebrated the
Midnight Mass in St. Peter's Basilica before more than 15,000
Romans, pilgrims, nuns and priests and a television audience in 50
nations, Vatican officials said.
   He quoted from the Apostle Paul, declaring that Christ ``has
appeared for the salvation of all men.''
   ``This salvation shapes human life in this world, and gives it a
form which is divine ... It also gives human existence on Earth its
definitive meaning, directing our life to future glory in Jesus
Christ.''
   This message, John Paul said, may be especially needed in
today's world. ``Amid all the achievements of the progress of
material civilization, is this not what they lack most?''
   The Vatican said it expected the midnight Mass to be telecast to
some 50 countries, and that about 60 countries were to carry the
pope's Christmas Day Mass and his traditional message ``Urbi et
Orbi'' - Latin for to the city and the world.
   The list of countries included the pope's native Poland, Romania
and the Soviet Union, which have all established diplomatic ties to
the Vatican in the past 18 months.
   Thousands of Albanians were also believed to have watched the
religious services, since Italian television reaches the tiny
Balkan Communist state. Albania has been officially atheist since
1967 but unprecedented protests recently prompted the relaxation of
restrictions on religion and political pluralism.
   ``I bring you good news of a great joy ... for to you is born
this day ... a Savior, who is Christ the Lord,'' John Paul
declared, quoting from the Gospel according to St. Luke.
   Among the petitions read at the Mass was one in Arabic asking
that God ``illuminate the minds of the leaders of nations so that
they may be builders of peace.''

   The week-old arctic deep freeze ran utilities and plumbers
ragged Monday with complaints of burst water pipes, and California
navel orange growers said their crop had been devastated by the
cold.
   The cold wave's advance brought an abrupt end to record balmy
weather along the East Coast, with some cities reporting record
highs during the morning followed by plummeting temperatures.
   The number of deaths blamed on the weather since the record cold
snap began rose to at least 79 by Monday. Most were traffic deaths
blamed on slippery roads. Others were killed by hypothermia,
tornadoes and fires started by overworked heaters.
   In Alabama, where heavy rain fell in advance of the cold air,
rescuers in boats ferried shivering residents from flooded houses
Monday as river and creeks continued rising after more than 1 foot
of rain from Friday night into Sunday. Hundreds of people had been
evacuated there and in parts of Tennessee.
   Temperatures stayed low Monday, including a record 16 below zero
at Burns, Ore.; 34 below at Roosevelt, Utah; 27 below at Richfield,
Utah; a record 33 below at Alamosa, Colo.; and 32 below at Big
Piney, Wyo. Casper, Wyo., warmed to 14 by midday, but the wind
chill was minus 21. The wind chill early Monday in northern Indiana
was 40 below.
   Readings of 20 below zero or colder were reported in Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.
   Sixteen cities in Colorado, New Mexico, California, Idaho,
Oregon and Nevada reported record lows Monday. The low of 19 at
Bakersfield, Calif., equalled the city's all-time record - which
was set Sunday. The low of 23 at Sacramento, Calif., broke a record
that had been on the books since 1879.
   The end of 85 hours of subzero temperatures Sunday in Denver
allowed a slight thaw that unleashed a flood of broken-pipe calls
as the ice that plugged and broke the pipes melted and let the
water flow.
   Boulder County firefighters found they were ``running about five
to six times our normal call loads, and most of them are broken
pipes,'' Fire Chief Chuck Boyes said.
   The San Francisco Fire Department stopped responding to reports
of frozen pipes after receiving 500 calls Sunday.
   Scores of Utah residents were without running water and numerous
fire alarms were activated when water lines to indoor sprinkler
systems snapped.
   ``I'm insane. We've had non-stop calls all morning,'' said Eric
Yost, a Salt Lake City Public Utilities dispatcher. ``Basically,
people don't believe that if you leave a little water running in a
tap, the line won't freeze.''
   He said one caller said he left his water running all night, but
turned off the tap at 7 a.m. Within an hour, the water line froze.
   ``There's busted pipes, frozen pipes, frozen sewer lines ... any
type of pipes you want to think of,'' said Juli Bingham, a Rescue
Rooter dispatcher in Salt Lake City.
   In Oregon, firefighters evacuated 59 residents of a Willamette
Valley retirement home Sunday when a cracked fire sprinkler flooded
the building.
   A ruptured gas main shut off service to 12,000 customers from
Sunday through Monday at Tupelo, Miss., while freezing rain and
snow flew in the area.
   The arrival of the cold air in the East had temperatures
flip-flopping.
   Atlanta had a record high Sunday of 73, but at 4 a.m. Monday the
temperature was 33 and by 9 a.m. it was 26.
   New York City had a record high Monday of 63 - but that was at
6:10 a.m. and five hours later thermometers read 43 with the
mercury continuing downward.
   California's navel orange crop was in trouble after temperatures
in the San Joaquin Valley citrus region dipped below 20 degrees
from Friday night through Sunday night. Navel oranges begin to show
damage if the temperature falls to 25 or 26 degrees and stays at
that level or below for at least four hours, reported Cliff Holland
of California Citrus Mutual, a grower organization.
   ``Yesterday, we cut these oranges in half. ... It was just like
cutting through a Popsicle,'' Bakersfield-area grower John Slikker
Jr. said Monday.
   ``Basically, I have written off the crop that is on the tree,''
said Chris Caviglia, a Tulare County grower. ``What I'm concerned
about now is the crop for next year. I could very well lose it as
well if the trees aren't protected.''
   ``Last night was the killer night,'' said Richard Berberian, a
grower in the Fowler-Sanger area. ``The navel is gone. The
Valencias are gone, the Minneolas are gone, the lemons are gone.''

   A 70-year-old man evidently froze to death
during a one-mile walk to his rural mailbox where a charity
delivered meals, authorities said.
   The body of Julius Skrede was discovered Monday at the farm
where he lived alone.
   Crawford County Coroner Jan Lund said Skrede apparently
collapsed Thursday. He had walked a half mile to the mailbox and
was almost back to his house when he fell and was unable to get up,
she said.
   Ms. Lund said Skrede, who had arthritis, had asked that the
Meals on Wheels program place food in the mailbox. A volunteer who
delivered Friday's meal discovered Monday it was still in the box
and investigated.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Omar Karami formed a
30-man Cabinet of pro-Syrian politicians and warlords Monday to try
to end Lebanon's civil war. But its mission was imperiled by a
right-wing Christian boycott.
   An official statement said President Elias Hrawi decreed the
formation of the half-Christian, half-Moslem government during a
five-hour meeting with Karami and Parliament Speaker Hussein
Husseini.
   The new Cabinet includes seven militia chieftains as state
ministers without portfolio - an apparent effort to get their
approval for a plan to disarm and disband all private armies in
Lebanon.
   Among them were Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, whose Progressive
Socialist Party fielded the strongest Moslem militia in the nearly
16-year-old civil war, and his Maronite Catholic foe, Samir Geagea.
   Jumblatt accepted his post, apparently under Syrian pressure,
despite earlier public criticism of Hrawi for alleged corruption
and favoritism.
   But Geagea's Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, said
in a statement that Geagea would not take up his Cabinet post
because the new government is heavily tilted toward Syrian-backed
leftists.
   George Saadeh, also a Maronite who heads the Phalange Party -
the nation's largest right-wing political force - rejected his post
as minister of telecommunications on the same grounds, a Phalangist
statement said.
   The post of foreign minister in the new Cabient went to Hrwai's
son-in-law, Fares Bweiz.
   With Jumblatt and Geagea, the other warlords in the Cabinet were
Nabih Berri, head of the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia;
Elie Hobeika, a Maronite who heads a breakaway faction of Geagea's
militia; Assaad Hardan of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party;
Suleiman Franjieh of the pro-Syrian Marada militia in north
Lebanon; and Abdulla al-Amin, leader of the small al-Assad
battalion, named after Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   It was the first time that Hardan's Nationalist Party - a
leftist Lebanese faction allied with Syria - has been brought into
a Lebanese government since Lebanon gained independence from France
in 1943.
   The group advocates the merger of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
pre-Israel Palestine, Iraq, Kuwait and Cyprus into a greater Syria.
   The rightist Christian boycott cast doubt on the new
government's ability to disband all militias.
   Geagea's 6,000-strong, heavily armed militia pulled out of
Beirut's Christian districts last month to allow Hrawi's government
to unite the capital and its environs in a militia-free ``greater
Beirut.''
   But Geagea's men are entrenched in the Kesrouan and Byblos
provinces - about 75 percent of Lebanon's Christian hinterland
north of Beirut.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main Shiite fundamentalist
ally in Lebanon, was excluded from the new Cabinet.
   Hezbollah, which controls one of Lebanon's three strongest
militias, had rejected the new government in advance, saying ``it
is certain to lack the vision and minimum degree of harmony
required to resolve the nation's woes.''
   Karami's government succeeds that of outgoing Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, who resigned with his 14-man Cabinet on Wednesday to
make way for a broad-based government of national reconciliation.
   Karami said his Cabinet would strive to bring about a lasting
peace, disarm all militias and launch a reconstruction campaign to
shore up the country's shattered economy.
   ``We believe that all concerned will eventually join the
government in order to achieve these national objectives,'' said
Karami, a Sunni Moslem.

   A landmine exploded under an army
ambulance convoy Monday, killing 18 soldiers and three civilians in
northern Sri Lanka, where the army is fighting Tamil secessionists,
the military and police said.
   Officials said the mine detonated in a marshy jungle near
Horowapatana village, where sick and wounded soldiers were being
taken for treatment.
   Village police said the blast blew up an army bus carrying 10
soldiers, two Sinhalese women and a male civilian, killing all of
them. Eight soldiers in a jeep behind the bus were killed and six
others badly hurt, police said.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
civilians had hitched a ride in the army vehicle.
   Horowopatana lies 130 miles northeast of Colombo in the
Polonnaruwa district, a predominantly Sinhalese region. It borders
the multi-ethnic Trincomalee district, where the Tamil separatist
war has been especially intense.
   Forty-two soldiers have been killed since Wednesday, when the
army renewed offensive operations against the Tamil Tigers, who are
fighting for independence for the Tamil minority in the northern
and eastern parts of the island state.
   The military says 131 rebels have been killed and 22 captured in
the offensive.
   More than 14,000 people have died in the Tamil war since 183.
Tamils, who make up 18 per cent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
population, say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese,
who comprise 75 per cent.

   A satellite link with Saudi Arabia gave U.S.
servicemen and women a chance to see and speak with relatives back
home on Monday.
   Several excited family members gathered at Boston's Lafayette
Hotel for the electronic rendezvous. The soldiers spoke from a
hotel in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
   Lori Curtin of Woburn was emotional as she reminded her husband,
Paul Curtin, that he asked her to marry him four years ago on
Christmas Eve.
   ``I feel so lucky to be able to talk to him today,'' Mrs. Curtin
said.
   The conversations were brief, lasting only a couple of minutes
each.
   One soldier, William Waters, donned a red Santa Claus hat while
talking to his family.
   ``He looks so great, so healthy,'' said his wife, Cathy Waters,
of Bedford. ``This was a really good Christmas pick-me-up. It's a
sad day, but this helps.''
   The project, sponsored by the City of Boston, the Lafayette
Hotel, the Boston Herald, WHDH radio and television, and the
Downtown Crossing Association, included a radio link with the USS
John F. Kennedy, an aircraft carrier stationed in the Gulf.

   Skirmishes between secular and
Islamic fundamentalist student groups have left two people dead
since the weekend, police said Monday.
   Acting President Shahabuddin Ahmed said the violence in this
southeastern port city was jeopardizing parliamentary elections
planned for Feb. 27.
   It was the first fighting among the rival student groups since
they united to lead the campaign that ousted President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad on Dec. 6.
   Ershad and several of his former ministers are under house
arrest as Bangladesh prepares for the elections.
   The clashes on Saturday and Sunday were between the
fundamentalist Islamic Students Organization and the All-Party
Student Unity, a coalition of secular students with various
political views.
   One of the 37 badly injured students, Farukur Zaman of the
secular group, died Monday.
   Later Monday, All Party organized a protest march to mourn the
death. Police said protesters grabbed a 40-year-old man and stabbed
him to death. The Islamic Students Organization identified the
victim as a member of its group, Syed Ahmed.
   The protesters also rampaged through central Chittagong,
damaging stores believed owned by fundamentalists, said police
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said the univeristy was closed indefinitely.
   The original clash Saturday began when fundamentalists attacked
students who ignored their call to boycott classes to press for
removal of a university official appointed by Ershad.
   United News of Bangladesh said Ahmed warned that the violence
was ``creating obstacles'' in holding the elections. It quoted him
as telling a delegation of fundamentalist students he received in
the capital Dhaka, ``You must exercise tolerance and avoid violence
if you want a peaceful election.''
   Ershad handed over power to Ahmed's caretaker government this
month following seven weeks of street protests against his rule.
Ershad, a former army general who seized power in 1982, is likely
to stand trial on corruption charges.
   Sultan Hossain Khan, the chief election commissioner appointed
by Ershad, resigned Monday under opposition pressure. The caretaker
government appointed Supreme Court judge Mohammad Abdur Rouf to
replace him, state TV reported.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reportedly threatened to make Tel
Aviv his first target if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, and
Israel on Monday promised swift and terrible retribution for any
Iraqi attack.
   Three weeks before the United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw its armies from Kuwait or face a possible military strike,
the Baghdad government recalled its ambassadors to the United
States and some European nations for urgent consultations,
diplomats said. No details about the talks were disclosed.
   In the sands of Saudi Arabia and the waters of the Persian Gulf,
hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops marked Christmas Eve with
muted celebrations and a heightened state of alert.
   Underscoring the somber holiday mood among U.S. forces, the
bodies of 20 of the 21 U.S. servicemen who died in the weekend
sinking of an Israeli ferry were flown back to the United States on
Tuesday. The ferry capsized as it was transporting crewmen to the
aircraft carrier USS Saratoga after shore leave.
   So far, 81 U.S. servicemen have died in Operation Desert Shield,
launched after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait nearly five months ago.
   The readiness of U.S. forces to fight was the topic as Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney met Monday with President Bush. Cheney,
returning a day earlier from a five-day trip to the Middle East,
said American troops would be ``prepared today, if we were ordered
today, to take military action.''
   Saddam's newest threat against Israel came in a Spanish
television interview to be broadcast Wednesday. The journalist who
spoke with the Iraqi leader in Baghdad on Saturday said Saddam told
him ``Tel Aviv would receive the first blow in the case of a gulf
war,'' whether or not Israel joined any multinational strike
against Iraq.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir responded to the reported
threat by telling Israel radio that Iraq ``will be harmed in a most
serious way'' if it attacks Israel.
   The new threat against Israel appeared to be a fresh bid by
Saddam to divide the anti-Iraq coalition, which includes some Arab
nations traditionally hostile to the Jewish state.
   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
Israel's most implacable enemy, indicated in an interview published
Tuesday the PLO would side with Saddam if war broke out.
   ``We have coordinated our plans to fight with Iraq in one
trench,'' PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's chief political adviser,
Hani Al-Hassan, told the Iraqi daily newspaper Al-Jumhuriya.
   Other Arab leaders, however, appealed to Saddam to give up
Kuwait before it is too late.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, at a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation
Council in Qatar, said ``it is braver to opt for peace than for
war.''
   Fahd said Saddam would find his gulf neighbors ready for
reconciliation if he left Kuwait, urging that Saddam ``know that
the curtain is not yet drawn on the scorching war and that he ...
can spare himself and his people its horror.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told reporters in Cairo that
Iraq would be the big loser if war breaks out.
   ``A very large number of Iraqi people will die,'' he said. ``The
decision of one man will lead to the death of hundreds of
thousands.''
   The Baghdad government, meanwhile, has been holding urgent
consultations on the gulf crisis with Iraq's ambassadors to 10
Western countries, Iraqi officials said.
   The Iraqi Embassy in Washington said the Iraqi envoy to the
United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, and Baghdad's envoy to the United
Nations, Abdul Al-Anbari, were among those summoned.
   Iraqi envoys to a number of European nations were also recalled
for talks, officials said. It was unclear how many were involved.
   In Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that forbids the practice of
other religions, U.S. troops planned a subdued Christmas. Soldiers
were to receive a special holiday meal of turkey, roast beef,
cranberry sauce and other traditional dishes.
   President Bush taped a Christmas message to American soldiers
worldwide, which was being broadcast Monday.
   ``The sacrifices you make will never be forgotten. America is
behind you. The world is behind you and history is behind you,'' he
said.
   In other developments:
   -Conservative Soviet lawmakers submitted a resolution to the
parliament on Monday demanding a vote before any Soviet troops are
sent to the region. The resolution seeks a special legislative
session held on the topic Jan. 14, the day before the U.N. deadline
for an Iraqi withdrawal.
   -French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement called off a
meeting with his Saudi counterpart after the Saudis refused to
allow a French rock 'n' roll star to perform for troops camped in
the desert, a French Embassy spokesman said. Eddy ``Schmoll'
Mitchell's 1950s-style music apparently offends the country's
strict Moslem tenets.

   Cardinal Jozef Glemp asked Poles in his
Christmas message Monday to put aside any anger left over from the
country's first popular presidential election campaign.
   The message from the leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
broadcast on national TV Christmas Eve, came two days after Lech
Walesa became president.
   Walesa won a bruising three-month battle for the nation's
highest office, but Solidarity now is split into rival camps, one
loyal to Walesa and the other to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Glemp cautioned that ``politics is not man's only life's breath.
Political moods change very quickly ... but the heart that is hurt
by hostility and prejudice remains scarred for a very long time.''

   It was another bone chilling morning across much of the West on
Monday. Subzero readings were reported across most of the northern
Plateau, the Great Basin and the Rocky Mountain region.
   Readings of 20 degrees below zero or colder were reported in
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.
   Sixteen cities reported record low temperatures for the date
this morning. The low of 19 degrees at Bakersfield, Calif.,
equalled their all-time record which was established Sunday
morning.
   Other record lows for Christmas Eve included Albuquerque, N.M.,
with 2 below zero; Reno, Nev., at 11 below; Fresno, Calif., at 22
degrees; Gallup, N.M., with 32 below zero; and Big Piney, Wyo.,
with 32 degrees below zero.
   Midday temperatures were still below zero across parts of the
northern Plateau, the Great Basin and the Rockies.
   Temperatures were above the freezing mark along the Pacific
Coast and in the desert Southwest, while readings warmed into the
50s along the coast of southern California.
   Monday morning's low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 38
below zero in Dulce, N.M.
   Bitter cold continued in the center of the nation with morning
lows generally in the single numbers or below zero from the High
Plains to the lower Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes.
   Readings dipped below zero across most of the upper Mississippi
Valley and upper Michigan. Subzero readings were also reported in
the northern and central Plains, the mid-Mississippi Valley, and
the lower Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures were still in the single numbers or below zero at
midday in the upper Mississippi Valley, as brisk westerly winds
warmed readings into the 20s across the northern Plains.
   Another frigid Arctic air mass hovered over southern Canada,
poised and ready to spill into the north central part of the United
States as low pressure and a trailing cold front move southeastward
out of southern Saskatchewan.
   A winter storm watch has been posted for northwest lower
Michigan and parts of upper Michigan near Lake Superior for
possible heavy snow on Christmas Day.
   Clouds, blustery winds and scattered light snow showers fell
throughout the north central United States while sunny skies
prevailed across the south central states.
   Record high readings were set ahead of the the Artic front that
moved relentlessly eastward. Some of the records established
included New York City at 63, Allentown, Pa., at 62, Philadelphia
at 64 and Miami hit 84.
   Strong northwesterly winds ushered in much colder air and by
midday readings had already dropped into the 30s and 40s.
   Snow prevailed behind the cold front as it crossed coastal New
England. Strong northwesterly winds behind the front produced snow
squalls in the upper Great Lakes. Rain and gale force wind ahead of
the cold front prevailed along the New England coast.

   A collision between two minivans on
Christmas Eve left six people dead and at least five people
injured, authorities said Monday.
   The accident occurred on Interstate 94 near Michigan City, about
two miles southwest of the Michigan state line.
   One of the vans crossed the median strip into oncoming traffic,
said state police Sgt. David Sylvester but further details were
unvailable. The road was dry at the time.
   The identities of the victims were not immediately available,
said David Heise, a LaPorte County Sheriff's deputy.
   The six who died were in the van that crossed into oncoming
traffic, police said. One person in that vehicle suffered bone
fractures and was listed in stable condition at Memorial Hospital.
   The two adults and two children in the other van, all members of
the same family, were treated for cuts and bruises at Memorial
Hospital and released, said nursing supervisor Lauretta Hapke.
   The interstate's westbound lane was closed to traffic for four
hours after the mid-afternoon accident.

<HEAD>Bush Briefed by Defense Secretary Cheney, Gen. Powell</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 4th graf: ``However, ABC-TV,'' report of Gen. Waller's
view relayed to Bush</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's top civilian and military
officers brought President Bush up to date on the tense situation
in the Persian Gulf Monday in a briefing at the president's
mountaintop retreat at Camp David.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, returned to Washington from a
five-day visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday and helicoptered Monday to
the camp about 60 miles north of the capital in western Maryland.
   Neither the White House nor the Defense Department gave any
details of their talks and Cheney made no comments to reporters
when he returned to the Pentagon.
   However, ABC-TV said Monday night, and The New York Times said
in Tuesday editions, that Bush was told senior officers shared the
view of Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller, deputy U.S. commander in Saudi
Arabia, that it would be late February before the troops would be
ready to attack Iraqi forces.
   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney and Powell met with senior commanders
and some of the nearly 300,000 American troops stationed in and
around the desert kingdom.
   The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from neighboring Kuwait, which the Iraqis invaded on Aug.
2 and later annexed.
   Cheney said during his Mideast trip that the refusal of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw as the deadline draws closer
increases the likelihood of war.
   ``Each day that goes by, each week without signs of an Iraqi
withdrawal, moves us that much closer to the point at which we and
other members of the coalition may have no other choice,'' Cheney
said during a stopover Sunday in Cairo.
   In the final days of their visit, Cheney and Powell toughened
their rhetoric against Saddam, apparently to counter statements
made a U.S. military official early in the trip that American
ground forces might not be ready for comment until after the
mid-January deadline.
   ``If I were Saddam Hussein, I would take very seriously what the
president said,'' Cheney said on the flight home. ``That is that we
are deploying the military capability to implement the U.N.
resolutions and to force him out of Kuwait should that be
necessary.''
   Cheney also said during the visit, in response to a sailor's
question, that he was confident the allies ``that really count''
would not abandon the multinational military force if Iraq withdrew
only partly from Kuwait. He specifically mentioned the Saudis,
Egyptians and British.
   On the flight home, he said he was not trying to imply that
Syria and France were hedging their commitment to support their
allies.
   Both Cheney and Powell said there was no timetable for attack by
U.S. forces, which include Marines stationed 50 miles from the
Iraqi border.
   The defense secretary described the trip as ``enormously
successful'' but gave no details of his meetings, some of which
even most of his top aides were not allowed to attend.
   After his return from Camp David, Cheney left for Wyoming for a
family vacation in his home state. He is expected back in
Washington right after New Year's Day.

<HEAD>Inquirer Recants Controversial Editorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer apologized
publicly for an editorial that had been attacked as racist because
it linked a new contraceptive to efforts to reverse poverty.
   The apology was contained in an editorial in the newspaper's
Dec. 23 edition.
   The newspaper took the unusual step in response to criticism of
a Dec. 12 editorial that suggested the contraceptive Norplant,
recently approved by the federal government, could help solve the
problem of poverty among blacks.
   ``The earlier Norplant editorial undercut our credibility and
our efforts to be a thoughtful, responsible and compassionate voice
on the complex issues of poverty,'' the newspaper said. ``We
apologize to those we hurt and offended.''
   The apology said the newspaper's own reporters, editors and
editorial board members were among those incensed by the original
editorial. It was printed alongside five letters to the editor,
containing both praise and criticism.
   The original editorial discussed two stories in the previous
day's newspaper. One was about Norplant, which prevents pregnancy
through implants of tiny rods under the skin and stays effective
for years, and the other was about a research finding that nearly
half of black children live in poverty and the situation is growing
worse.
   ---
   Here is the text of the editorial, headlined ``An apology'' and
subtitled ``The editorial on `Norplant and poverty' was misguided
and wrong-headed.'':
   
   It's rare that we regret publishing an editorial from almost the
moment it appears in print. And it's rarer still that we feel the
need to apologize to our readers for a misguided and wrong-headed
editorial opinion. But such is the case with the editorial that
appeared in this space on Dec. 12 entitled ``Norplant and
poverty.'' Great pain, anger and controversy have resulted from
that editorial, and we deeply regret our decision to print it.
   Among the people who were incensed by the editorial were many of
the Inquirer's own reporters, editors and members of the Editorial
Board. In the days since it appeared, we have been doing a lot of
listening and soul-searching.
   We realize now that we hastily and foolishly juxtaposed two news
items that appeared in the Inquirer the previous day - federal
approval of the long-term contraceptive Norplant and the release of
a research group's report that said nearly half of black children
are living in poverty and that the situation is getting worse with
time. The editorial posed the question of whether encouraging women
who are on welfare to use Norplant could help reverse this bleak
trend.
   Where did we go wrong? Let's begin with the headline, which
asked whether contraception could ``reduce the underclass'' and
thus aroused people's fears of something far worse than promoting
birth control. Later, we used the word ``eugenics'' as a way of
explaining what we didn't mean, but it only inflamed matters more.
Most fundamentally, in linking the issues of race and
contraception, we left too many people with the impression that our
cure for poverty was to reduce the number of black people. Although
that certainly was not what we meant to suggest, the fact that so
many people interpreted it that way is a clear indication that the
editorial was fatally flawed. Therefore we failed in our effort to
provoke thoughtful discussion on the issue of birth control and
poverty.
   It's true that many single young women lessen their chances of
escaping poverty by having children too early in life. But it'salso true
that the very hopelessness of their circumstances often
underlies the decision not to postpone child-bearing. Creating hope
where none now exists must be the main tenet of any effective war
on poverty.
   In the previous editorial we said that women on welfare should
be encouraged, but not compelled, to use Norplant. We suggested
incentives, such as an additional benefit of some kind. Our critics
countered that to dangle cash or some other benefit in front of a
desperately poor woman is tantamount to coercion. They're right.
   We still believe that this new form of reliable birth control,
which is likely to have wide appeal to middle-class women, should
be equally available to poor women who want to use it. But we also
realize - and should have been even clearer about it - that this
has to be a matter of personal choice. We don't seek to limit the
options of poor women, but to empower them.
   We remain committed to a whole host of strategies for reducing
poverty - from better schools to job training to radical welfare
reform. We think education about birth control is important, and if
Norplant lives up to its advance billing, it could be helpful to
many women.
   And we wish we had said it that way to begin with. The earlier
Norplant editorial undercut our credibility and our efforts to be a
thoughtful, responsible and compassionate voice on the complex
issues of poverty. We apologize to those we hurt and offended.

<HEAD>Boston Globe To Trim Work Force Through Attrition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing declines in advertising, The Boston Globe
announced it will reduce its work force by 100 full-time positions
through attrition over the next five years.
   The 100 positions represent about 5 percent of the full-time
staff at the Globe, which employs 2,075 full-time and 500 part-time
workers.
   ``We are experiencing the same economic forces affecting other
companies,'' said William O. Taylor, publisher of the Globe and
chairman of the newspaper's parent company, Affiliated Publications
Inc.
   ``Advertising is down significantly this year, and the outlook
is cautious at best,'' he said. ``We think this is the least
painful way to address the need to be as cost-effective as we can
for the future.''
   The attrition program is another step in an overall cost-cutting
effort at the Globe, which began with budget cuts in the spring of
1988. It has also included reductions in department expenditures
and in hours of some part-time staff.
   Taylor earlier said he expected earnings to be down
significantly at Affiliated Publications, and that the company
planned to raise the price of the Globe from 35 cents to 50 cents
in April in areas 30 miles outside the city.

<HEAD>FNN Owner Says It Can't Repay $20.7 Million Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infotechnology Inc., the cash-strapped owner of
Financial News Network and United Press International, said Dec. 22
that it could not repay a $20.7 million loan that was called in
early.
   The lenders, Security Pacific National Bank and MidLantic
National Bank, now have the right to foreclose on Infotechnology's
46 percent stock interest in FNN, a cable television network.
   The FNN stock was placed as collateral for the loan, which
originally was due next July. The banks did not say why they called
in the loan early and would not say whether they would exercise
their foreclosure option.
   An Infotechnology spokeswoman said the company did not believe
the banks would foreclose on the loan and it would continue seeking
buyers for its media subsidiaries to raise cash.
   The development was the latest blow to Infotechnology, whose FNN
subsidiary reported on Dec. 18 that it lost $72.5 million in its
1990 fiscal year. UPI, a news wire service, reportedly has been
losing as much as $2.5 million a month.
   Last month, UPI union and management employees agreed to a 35
percent pay cut for 90 days to give the news service time to find a
buyer. UPI has changed ownership three times in eight years.
   FNN provides stock quotes, business and financial news, and
sports information on a cable TV network to more than 35 million
homes served by 3,500 in the United States and Canada.
   FNN said its loss stemmed primarily from accounting changes
totaling $65 million. FNN said said the changes regarded improperly
documented lease transactions, new product development costs and
payments to UPI.
   FNN said it was in the process of revising its quarterly reports
for the first three quarters of 1990 to reflect a review conducted
by FNN and its new accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   In October, FNN dismissed C. Steven Bolen, chief financial
officer, for improper financial dealings.
   The FNN financial report said an investigation concluded Bolen
had payments made to himself totaling $794,061 that were ``not
properly authorized and not properly identified on (FNN's) books.''
   ``Through his counsel, Mr. Bolen claimed that such payments were
earned by him as incentive compensation for arranging financing for
the company,'' the filing stated.
   FNN said it was considering suing Bolen to recover the money.

<HEAD>St. Petersburg Times Discloses Some Terms of Bass Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After settling a shareholder suit
with Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass and others, the Times
Publishing Co. has emerged with $8.1 million cash and a healthy
balance sheet, newly disclosed documents show.
   The settlement reached in August specified that neither side
would reveal any details, but Times Publishing released some
information Dec. 18 to satisfy requests from the state of Florida.
   The disclosure gave several details about the privately held
company that publishes the St. Petersburg Times. But the amount the
company paid Bass to drop his suit was not reported.
   Under the terms of the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to
buy back a 40-percent stake owned by the Bass group. The group had
purchased the stake in August 1988 for about $28 million and had
offered to buy the rest of the company for $270 million earlier
this year.
   The documents released Dec. 18 show total bank debt for the
newspaper company as of Nov. 30 was $9 million.
   ``The company is strong and vital and we can go on to other
things,'' chief executive and editor Andrew Barnes said.
   According to treasurer Catherine Heron, the company's cash
position ``would cover the majority of existing bank debt.''
   The $9 million debt will be paid off by 1995, she said.
   The documents were released to the Florida attorney general's
office, which was concerned that the shareholder settlement could
adversely affect the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St.
Petersburg.
   The institute is the chief shareholder of Times publishing.
After acquiring its stake, the Bass partnership had sued Times
Publishing over dividend payments, the bulk of which support the
institute's educational programs.
   Under the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to buy back the
Bass stake and redeem an issue of non-voting stock, which paid
healthy dividends to the institute.
   At the time of the settlement, the company claimed the agreement
would not hurt the institute. It said the preferred shares held by
the institute would be replaced by debt, which would pay more in
annual interest than the preferred stock once paid in dividends.
The company said the institute also could expect to receive
dividends from the common stock it holds.
   The latest disclosures show the institute eventually will own
all of the Times Publishing common stock.
   Robert Lanzillotti, dean emeritus of the University of Florida's
graduate business school, was hired by the institute to
independently review the Bass settlement.
   He said it ``will make possible substantially greater financial
support for the institute's operations and growth over the long
run.''
   In addition to the St. Petersburg newspaper, one of the largest
and most prominent in the South, Times Publishing runs
Congressional Quarterly, Florida Trend and Georgia Trend magazines.

<HEAD>Daily News Sues Unions Over Interference With Dealers, Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News accused its striking unions of
violating federal labor law by using a ``campaign of violence''
against the newspaper's dealers and advertisers.
   The allegations were contained in a lawsuit filed Dec. 17, the
second filed by the News against the unions in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan since the strike began Oct. 25.
   The first lawsuit was brought under the civil racketeering
statute and accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a
violent conspiracy to force a favorable labor settlement or the
sale of the newspaper.
   The new complaint claims the unions violated the
Labor-Management Relations Act, which prohibits unions from
interfering with the business of parties not involved in a labor
dispute.
   ``The defendants and agents acting on their behalf have mounted
a campaign of violence and intimidation against the News' dealers
and advertisers in an effort to disrupt the publication and sale of
the newspaper,'' the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit asks for more than $50 million in losses that the
News claims it incurred as a result of the campaign, which it said
included ``many hundreds'' of incidents of arson, assault,
vandalism, threats and harassment.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor attorney and adviser to the unions,
denied the allegations. He cited recent testimony by senior police
officials who said investigations found the violence was committed
by individuals and was not part of a coordinated conspiracy.
   Kheel said the News' lawsuits against the unions constituted
``harassment.''
   The News has published every day during the strike, but the
majority of the city's 12,000 newsstands and vendors have stopped
selling the paper and major advertisers have pulled their accounts.
   Before the strike, it was the nation's third-largest
metropolitan daily, with circulation of 1.09 million. Circulation
has dropped to about 600,000.

<HEAD>Detroit Papers Raise Home Delivery Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press
announced a home delivery increase of 25 cents a week to cover the
cost of rising newsprint, labor and fuel.
   Seven-day home delivery of the News will increase to $2.25 and
the Free Press to $2.50 in the metropolitan area, and home delivery
of both papers will cost $3.35 a week elsewhere in the state, the
Detroit Newspaper Agency said.
   Newsstand and coin box prices in the Detroit area will remain
the same at 25 cents, but daily editions of both papers will rise
to 35 cents from 25 cents elsewhere in the state. The combined
Sunday edition will cost $1.25 statewide, up from $1.
   Joseph Ungaro, president and chief executive officer of the
newspaper agency, which administers combined operations of the two
papers, said the cost of newsprint will rise 11 percent over the
next six months, and fuel costs have gone up for the company's
delivery trucks, which drive more than 124,000 miles a week.

<HEAD>New York Times Boosts Price of National Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of The New York Times' national
edition will go up to 75 cents in the Midwest and Southwest on Jan.
14.
   The Times had been charging 50 cents for daily copies of its
national edition in the Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest,
spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said Thursday.
   The higher price reflects the newspaper's higher production and
distribution costs, she said.
   The price for the national edition in the Southeast was raised
to 75 cents last September. It still costs 50 cents on the West
Coast. The daily paper costs 50 cents in the Northeast, except in
the tri-state area near New York where it is 40 cents.

<HEAD>The National To Boost Cover Price to 75 Cents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite falling short of circulation goals, The
National is planning to boost its cover price by a quarter to 75
cents on Jan. 21.
   In addition, the sports newspaper said Dec. 21 that it would
test a $1 daily price for one or two of its 10 metropolitan
editions. Specific editions have not yet been selected for the
test, spokesman Stephen Hammond said.
   The move comes as the 11-month-old newspaper is trying to prove
there are enough readers to sustain the first all-sports daily in
the United States. It also comes when the weakest advertising
market in 15 years is driving newspapers to find alternate methods
of generating more revenue.
   Two weeks ago, The National told advertisers it was reducing its
circulation guarantee by 27 percent to 200,000 copies. The
admission that it was not making its guaranteed average of 275,000
followed a review that resulted in elimination of its Sunday
edition, the dismissal of the circulation manager and two other top
executives and layoffs of 18 other employees.
   The paper is now publishing five times a week, Monday through
Friday.
   The National has editions in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles San
Diego, San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit, Boston, Miami-Fort
Lauderdale and Baltimore-Washington, D.C. It is scheduled to expand
next year with editions in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Denver and
Seattle, insiders said.

<HEAD>S.F. Mayor Will Sign Landmark VDT Law, Aides Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses will have up to four years
instead of two to provide safer equipment and working conditions
for video display terminal users under a compromise Mayor Art Agnos
has agreed to sign, his aides say.
   What was hailed as the nation's toughest VDT law won final
approval from the city Board of Supervisors on Dec. 17, but Agnos
wouldn't commit to signing it until he talked to business and labor
groups about its impact and cost.
   After a weekend meeting with Agnos, the two sides agreed Dec. 22
to several amendments, one of which would extend the compliance
period from two years to as many as four years, the mayor's aides
said.
   The compromise, which Agnos plans to sign Dec. 27, must go back
to the supervisors for approval.
   ``This is an example of what happens when both sides come to the
table. And we now have something that both sides can live with,''
said Claude Everhart, deputy mayor for government operations, who
mediated the negotiations.
   The compromise measure still calls for frequent work breaks,
proper lighting, anti-glare screens, adjustable computer furniture
and equipment to make VDT use safer.
   Among the problems associated with regular work at a computer
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neck
strain, eye strain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nausea
and fatigue.
   Labor leaders hope the VDT law will be a model for other cities
and counties in California and for the state and other states
nationwide.
   Business groups have consistently opposed efforts to pass such
legislation because of its expense and because some doubt VDT use
causes health problems.
   City budget analysts estimate businesses will spend as much as
$76.5 million and the city as much as $6 million to comply with the
law.

<HEAD>Dallas Times Herald Seeks New Trial in Antitrust Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of the Dallas Times Herald
asked a state appeals court Dec. 19 to order a new trial of its
antitrust lawsuit against The Dallas Morning News.
   The dispute grew out of a deal in which the Times Herald lost 26
features and comics, including Doonesbury and Dear Abby, to its
larger rival. The Times Herald Printing Co. unsuccessfully sued the
Morning News and its parent company, A.H. Belo Corp., for $33
million.
   The Times Herald claims in its appeal that state district Judge
David West erred when he told the jury to ignore potentially
anti-competitive behavior by the Morning News if it could be shown
that the Morning News also was pursuing a legitimate business goal.
   The appeal also says West should have granted the Times Herald's
motion for a new trial.
   Michael J. McCarthy, Belo senior vice president-secretary and
general counsel, said he thought the judge acted correctly.
   In the lawsuit, the Times Herald accused the Morning News and
Belo of violating state antitrust laws in a transaction reached
with Universal Press Syndicate in August 1989.
   The lawsuit accused the Times Herald's larger rival of trying to
force it out of business through the deal with Universal, which
stripped the Times Herald of the features and comics.
   During the trial Belo and the Morning News said the main reason
for their deal with Universal was to create a joint venture to
develop television programming based on Universal comics and
features.
   Belo attorneys argued it made no sense for the joint venture to
promote features appearing in a competing paper.
   Belo and the Morning News have 25 days to respond to the appeal.
Oral arguments could be held as early as June, with no final
decision likely before next December.

<HEAD>Financial Columnist on McDonald's Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A columnist and TV commentator who reports on
financial news says there is no ethical conflict between her work
and her appointment to the McDonald's Corp. board of directors.
   ``This won't be a problem,'' said Terry Savage, who writes a
weekly financial news column for the Chicago Sun-Times and Dallas
Times Herald, and who appears regularly on Chicago station WBBM.
   Savage, 46, the first woman named to the company's board in 20
years, will receive $24,000 a year from McDonald's plus $2,000 for
each board meeting attended.
   Officials at the newspapers and TV station said Savage promised
to stay away from any issues that could be construed as conflicting
with her role on the McDonald's board.
   ``We will make sure she does not write about the food industry,
and McDonald's in particular,'' said Jim Frisinger, Times Herald
business editor.
   But George Harmon, who teaches business writing at Northwestern
University's graduate school of journalism, said it would be hard
to avoid the apperance of a conflict because McDonald's influences
so much of the business world.
   He said Savage could be restricted from reporting on the beef,
potato and recycling industries and even the stock market because
McDonald's is among the 30 companies whose performances are
reflected in the Dow Jones industrials average.
   ``If somebody wanted to restrict Terry from reporting on
McDonald's and be very strict about that, it would restrain her
considerably,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Guild Pickets Journal-Bulletin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 members of the Providence
Newspaper Guild picketed The Providence Journal-Bulletin on Dec. 19
to protest stalled wage talks.
   ``We're dealing with one of the wealthiest corporations in Rhode
Island,'' said Tim Schick, the Guild's local administrator. ``They
have only seen fit to put 2 percent on the table for '91.''
   R. Barrie Schmitt, the newspaper's personnel and labor relations
director, declined to comment, saying the negotiations are under
the jurisdiction of a federal mediator.
   The local Guild represents 510 reporters, editors, advertising
salespeople and support staff.
   Schick said the union contract calls for negotiations to be
reopened on wages for 1991, the final year of the agreement. But
the company has concentrated instead on trying to negotiate a
completely new three-year contract, he said.
   The company offered wage increases of 4 percent in the first
year of a new agreement, and 3 percent and 2 percent in the
subsequent years, the union said. If the union is unwilling to go
with a new contract, increases would only be 2 percent each year,
Schick said.
   The union is seeking wage increases of $48 a week across the
board, which would be an average increase of 7.5 percent. Reporters
earning top-level wages are paid $756 a week and editors at the
same seniority earn $830.

<HEAD>Federal Courts Set TV Experiment for Eight Courts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' first televised look at federal
judges at work likely will occur next year in appeals courts in New
York or San Francisco or a trial court in one of six states.
   ``The courts have been selected. Now, it's a matter of the news
media requesting coverage in particular cases,'' David Sellers, a
spokesman for the policymaking U.S. Judicial Conference said Dec.
21.
   The conference, composed of 27 federal judges and headed by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, approved the three-year
experiment in September. Individual courts then were invited to
volunteer.
   Those selected are federal appellate courts based in San
Francisco and New York City and U.S. district courts in Indiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.
   Beginning in July, broadcast and photographic access will be
allowed in civil cases in the selected courts. Judges will have
broad discretion to reject requests for coverage.
   Cameras and radio equipment have been banned from federal courts
since 1937, but 45 states allow some form of broadcast or
photographic coverage of proceedings in their courts.
   The federal experiment, to run through June 1994, will be
monitored by the Federal Judicial Center, a study group for the
federal courts.

<HEAD>Bolles Murder Case Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have decided to retry the two men
whose murder convictions in the 1976 car bomb slaying of newspaper
reporter Don Bolles were overturned a decade ago.
   Contractor Max Dunlap was charged Dec. 19 with the murder of the
Arizona Republic investigative reporter. Former plumber James
Robison was charged again in 1989.
   John Harvey Adamson, who was the prosecution's chief witness at
the 1977 trial, and then refused to testify after the convictions
were overturned, has been offered a deal and will take the stand
once more, Attorney General Bob Corbin said.
   Corbin said this time he has a stronger case, but he wouldn't
say what evidence he has or why Adamson, whom he once derided as no
longer a credible witness, was working with authorities again.
   But a criminal complaint filed Dec. 19 also accuses Dunlap and
Robison this time of conspiring with others to obstruct justice and
influence witnesses in the original case.
   According to the complaint, Dunlap and Robison were overheard
talking about payments made to Robison and Adamson to keep them
quiet over the last 14 years.
   Bolles died in 1976, 11 days after a radio-controlled bomb
ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking lot.
   Adamson testified that he planted the bomb under Bolles' car and
Robison triggered it on orders from Dunlap. He said Dunlap wanted
to ingratiate himself with land and liquor magnate Kemper Marley,
who had been the target of several critical stories by Bolles.
Marley died earlier this year.
   Bolles had won acclaim for his exposes on land fraud, dog racing
and organized crime.
   Robison and Dunlap were convicted of murder and sentenced to
death, but the state Supreme Court reversed the convictions in
1980, saying the defense had been unfairly prevented from asking
Adamson certain questions.
   Adamson, a greyhound breeder and tow-truck operator, was
originally allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges and sentenced
to 20 years in prison in exchange for his testimony. After the
convictions were thrown out, he refused to testify again unless
authorities paid for his children's education.
   Corbin said that destroyed Adamson's credibility, and he was
then charged with murder. He was convicted and is serving life in
prison.
   In exchange for his testimony this time, his sentence will be
reduced to a maximum of 20 years.

<HEAD>No More Jail for Reporter Who Refused To Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter threatened with jail for
refusing to testify in a homicide case got off the hook Dec. 19
when prosecutors decided not to call her to the stand.
   A jury recommended the death sentence for Jermarr Arnold in the
1983 killing of a jewelry store employee. Prosecutors earlier
wanted Corpus Christi Caller-Times reporter Libby Averyt to testify
about unpublished details of her interview with Arnold, during
which he showed no remorse for the killing.
   But in testimony during the penalty phase of the trial after he
was found guilty, Arnold himself said that he had no remorse or
apologies for the killing.
   ``You'd be making a very correct decision by sentencing me to
death,'' he told the jury.
   Ms. Averyt was jailed Dec. 7 for refusing to answer questions
about unpublished information from her interviews. She was released
two days later but remained under subpoena until the trial ended.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Inquirer Asks Judge To Throw Out Libel Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer asked a judge Dec.
17 to dismiss a $6 million libel verdict a state Supreme Court
justice won after the paper allegedly defamed him.
   ``The verdict was against the evidence (and) improper, contrary
to law and fact,'' according to a motion for a new trial by
Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., which owns the Inquirer.
   Attorney William Hangley filed the motion, which went to Common
Pleas Judge John Lavelle of Carbon County. There was no indication
when Lavelle would rule or set a hearing.
   Inquirer reporter Daniel Biddle wrote a 1983 series of articles
that questioned the ethical conduct of members of the state's
highest court.
   Justice James T. McDermott filed two lawsuits against the
newspaper, one for the original series, and one for the reprint
which went to the 1984 conference of the American Judicature
Society.
   The jury decided on Dec. 7 that Biddle's original series was not
libelous but that portions of a February 1984 reprint were false.
The reprint contained the same text as the original series but was
accompanied by an introduction, two editorials and two cartoons
that had not appeared with the original series.
   ``There was no evidence that anyone at the AJS meeting actually
read the articles in reprint form at the seminar or anywhere
else,'' Hangley said in the motion.
   Hangley argued a new trial was warranted because the award of
compensatory and punitive damages ``is so excessive as to shock the
conscience.''
   ``The jury's verdicts were inconsistent and irreconcilable,''
the motion said. ``The court should correct and set aside such a
verdict.''
   The ruling was the second libel judgment against the paper in a
year. In May an attorney won a record $34 million finding against
the paper for a 1973 story criticizing his handling of a homicide
case while he was assistant district attorney. The paper is
appealing that ruling as well.

<HEAD>Libel Suit Against Herb Caen Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has dismissed a libel case
against San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, saying his
item about a deputy sheriff's arrest on violence and drug charges
was not libelous because it was true.
   The state Court of Appeal on Dec. 18 dismissed the libel suit by
former San Francisco sheriff's deputy Robert Heimbaugh.
   Caen wrote in January 1987 that Heimbaugh had been ``booked at
city jail on charges of brandishing a gun, beating his live-in lady
friend and possessing drug paraphernalia. The district attorney's
office wants to prosecute but is in a quandary because the
allegedly battered nonbride will not testify against him. Heimbaugh
is out on bail and on medical leave.''
   The appeals court said the deputy had indeed been arrested 10
days before the column appeared on charges of ``corporal punishment
of a cohabitant, brandishing a weapon, and possession of narcotics
paraphernalia.''
   Therefore, the lawsuit was without merit, the court ruled. The
charges against Heimbaugh were later dropped.
   Caen has written a daily short-item column featuring gossip,
jokes and tales about San Francisco and its people for 52 years. In
a footnote, the court characterized Caen as ``the journalistic
equivalent of the Golden Gate Bridge.''
   Heimbaugh did not dispute the facts in the item, but argued that
the column was untrue because the charges were later dropped and
his bail was canceled. The court ruled that those developments did
not make the published item libelous.
   Heimbaugh resigned from the sheriff's department and works as a
cab driver and bartender in San Francisco. He also has worked as a
legal researcher.
   He said that although he had not yet seen the court's opinion he
intended to appeal.

<HEAD>Judge's Defamation Suit Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A circuit judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a
Colombian judge who was relocated to the Detroit area because of
death threats.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge Edward M. Thomas on Dec. 20 dismissed
a suit by Judge Consuela Sanchez-Duran and her husband, Augusto
Sanabria.
   The couple filed suit in 1989 against The Detroit News, Detroit
Free Press and television stations WJBK and WXYZ after they
reported she was living in the Detroit area. The judge called the
reports ``unnecessary and dangerous, recklessly placing them and
the general public in a position of harm.''
   The media reported Sanchez-Duran's whereabouts as part of a
story on her being relocated by U.S. officials after her life was
threatened. The death threats came after Sanchez-Duran ordered the
arrest of Pablo Escobar, alleged head of the Medellin cartel South
American cocaine ring.
   Thomas said the reports were on a matter of public interest and
caused no invasion of privacy, defamation or intentional or
negligent infliction of emotional distress. Thomas noted the judge
had used her own name while working in the Colombian consular
office in the Detroit area, as well as in renting apartments,
shopping and eating out.
   Sanchez-Duran's attorney, Cyril Weiner, said he would appeal.

   A judge who ordered a dozen people found
guilty of drunken driving, shoplifting and other misdemeanors to
advertise their crimes changed his mind when The Pensacola News
Journal refused to go along.
   County Judge William White ordered the offenders to buy space to
publish their pictures, charges and sentences.
   ``The newspaper as a matter of policy does not wish to become a
vehicle for court-ordered public humiliation,'' Publisher Kenneth
Andrews said Dec. 19.
   ``The advertising columns of the newspaper are open for free and
voluntary expression within reasonable bounds of propriety, and if
the ads ordered by Judge White are accepted, other courts may
consider involuntary newspaper advertising as a potential method of
punishing defendants.''
   The court order called for an ad at least one column wide and 2
inches tall. White said he considered the measure harsh, but said
it would help deter the holiday season rise in drunken driving,
theft and the spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>TV Station Surrenders Taped Interview to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television interview with a man whose wife
has been missing since Dec. 8 was seized by police who got a search
warrant to obtain the tape from KTWO-TV, managing editor Charles
Brown said.
   The woman's husband had complained in the interview that police
were spending too much time treating him like a suspect when they
should be searching for his wife.
   On Dec. 18, police seized the taped interview, saying it
``constitutes evidence.''
   Brown said the station decided not to challenge the warrant, in
part because the husband had approached KTWO on his own.
Additionally, station officials didn't think the interview
contained any comments that the man hadn't already made to police,
he said.
   ``Our position was we take this on a case-by-base basis,'' Brown
said. ``I think it just ought to be on a case-by-case basis. I
don't think you should turn stuff over voluntarily, but responding
to a search warrant is different.''
   According to an affidavit that accompanied the warrant, police
wanted the tape because it contained statements made by the husband
that they believe show he concealed a stolen gun and military
equipment found when officers searched the couple's house after she
disappeared.
   Michael Krampner, a lawyer working with the Wyoming Press
Association, said KTWO already had broadcast a portion of the
interview and so there was little argument for confidentiality of
the tape.
   ``As the law now is in Wyoming, journalists are no different
from any other citizens,'' he said. ``If they receive a subpoena to
come to court and tell what they know, they're just like any other
citizen, they have the obligation to respond to that. If a court
issues a valid search warrant ... obviously they have to stand
aside and let them search for it just like any other citizens.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Bill Easing Secrecy of Criminal Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Dec. 17 signed
into law a bill to reduce the secrecy of the state's criminal
records, ending a three-year struggle to overhaul the Criminal
Offender Records Information law.
   The revised law is a compromise between those who wanted the
records opened completely and those who wanted the secrecy
maintained. It will keep records open from one to three years,
depending on the crime and prison sentence.
   As passed in 1972, the law kept virtually all criminal records
secret.
   The drive to change it began in the wake of the Willie Horton
case that became a major issue in the presidential campaign between
Dukakis and George Bush.
   The records law was little known to the public until Horton, a
convicted first-degree murderer from Lawrence, escaped from his
10th prison furlough and went on to rape a young Maryland woman and
stab her fiance repeatedly in March 1987.
   Citing the law, state correction officials refused to say why
they gave Horton weekend passes after he had been sentenced to life
in prison without parole for the slaying of a teen-ager.
   Horton's records were released only after the Lawrence
Eagle-Tribune sued.

<HEAD>Almanac Accuses New York Magazine of Stealing its Cover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, the folksy,
old-fashioned American tradition, has taken on New York Magazine,
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city.
   The 199-year-old Farmer's Almanac filed a trademark infringement
lawsuit Dec. 19 accusing New York Magazine of imitating the
almanac's distinctive cover design on the cover of its Dec. 3
issue.
   The almanac's publisher, Yankee Publishing Inc. of Dublin, N.H.,
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to
believe that the almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its
use by New York Magazine.
   The lawsuit further claimed that New York Magazine, by imitating
its trademarked cover, had ``impaired the value of Yankee's cover
design and the goodwill symbolized by it.''
   New York Magazine had no immediate comment.
   The disputed cover in dispute, titled ``The 1990 Christmas Gifts
Almanac,'' promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays.
It is illustrated in a similar design as used by the almanac.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks an
order barring New York Magazine from using the cover design in the
future and unspecified damages.

<HEAD>Report Finds 1990 Unhappy Year for Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year 1990 was an unhappy one for journalists,
with some of the most serious setbacks coming where hope had been
strongest, the International Press Institute reported.
   The institute's World Press Freedom Review paid particular
attention to press difficulties in Romania, Yugoslavia, South
Africa, Turkey, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Chile, Colombia and Iraq.
   ``There has been an increase in attacks on the media, and they
most galling aspect of all is that they are occurring in countries
where we had been given good reason to hope for dramatic changes
for the better,'' IPI Director Peter Galliner wrote in the report
released Dec. 14.
   Galliner said one of 1990's most gruesome incidents was the
execution in Iraq of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist
working for The Observer newspaper of London. Bazoft was accused of
spying.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait silenced about 40 Kuwaiti
publications, the report noted.
   ``Ironically, one consequence of Saddam Hussein's move has been
the opening ... of the Saudi media, which have been obliged to tell
the population the truth, at long last, faced with the evidence all
around them,'' Galliner wrote.
   ``But the Arab media, as a whole, remain shackled and
subservient to the political line of their respective
governments.''

<HEAD>Der Spiegel Reporter Suspected of Spying for East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Der Spiegel did a 13-page cover story on
allegations that one of its reporters was a spy for Communist East
Germany.
   The allegations concerning Diethelm Schroeder surfaced in a
television expose and Spiegel did its own story in the Dec. 17
issue.
   The Hamburg-based newsweekly left Schroeder's name on te roster
of its Berlin bureau, but noted he was ``on leave.''
   Spiegel showed the drubbing it took from other German
publications: a headline in the mass-circulation daily Bild asked
if Schroeder was ``a traitor.'' A cartoon republished from the
Rheinische Post showed a Spiegel sleuth following a spy's tracks -
in a circle that became Spiegel's own trail.
   ``I have to live with this story,'' Schroeder said in a
telephone interview, denying he had worked for the East German
secret service or done anybody any harm.
   The 60-year-old native of eastern Germany, a military specialist
who worked in The Associated Press' German-language service for
five years in the Sixties, said his Spiegel colleagues had
explained that they had done major stories on other spy allegations
``and now we have to write a story about you.''
   ``I think it's correct,'' Schroeder said, adding with a laugh,
``I would have had more fun if it was another story, I think.''
   ARD television named Schroeder as having worked from 1964 to
1987 for the Stasi, as the now-defunct East Germany's Ministry for
State Security is called.
   Prosecutors confirmed that Schroeder was under investigation,
though there was no word on how serious a case he might face.
Conviction for passing state secrets can bring life in prison,
while a lesser charge of passing information to a foreign espionage
agency carries a maximum 10-year prison term.
   As Germany works to clear up the decades of cross-border spying,
prosecutors have already issued 61 arrest warrants this year.
   Spiegel, which grew up with postwar West Germany, has been
hitting the espionage issue hard along with other issues facing
newly united Germany.
   Only a week earlier, Spiegel had a scoop revealing evidence that
East Germany's first and only non-Communist prime minister, Lothar
de Maiziere, had a Stasi past. De Maiziere denies cooperating with
secret police but quit as deputy head of the governing Christian
Democratic Union while prosecutors look into the evidence.

injured 10 people over the weekend.
   The attacks were designed ``to create confusion and damage our

<HEAD>If U Cn Rd Ths, U Owe Me $125</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Success magazine, an editor's mistakes are
costly: $25 for a mispelling (er, misspelling). Another $25 for
poorly-placed hyphens. A whopping $500 for getting somebody's name
wrong.
   For the past two months, sloppy copy has meant surrendering cold
cash at Success. Gleefully plundering inattentive editors is Editor
in Chief Scott DeGarmo, who says he grew tired of making the same
complaints to the same people about the same errors.
   ``When my people see a typo anyplace, I want them to step on it
like a roach,'' DeGarmo said Dec. 19.
   But taking money for mistakes? Isn't that a little extreme?
   ``No! If you asked the average guy on the street, he would say
of course an editor should know how to spell,'' DeGarmo said. ``If
a bricklayer made a crooked wall, or an accountant couldn't add,
people would be angry. But editors think it's nothing to not know
how to spell.''
   The wallet-lightening approach to achieving good grammar began
Nov. 5 at the monthly magazine, when DeGarmo fired off a memo to
his six senior editors. Errors would no longer be tolerated; fines
would be levied.
   DeGarmo, in the course of his job, would check all copy handed
in by his senior editors. If he caught any grammatical or
typographical errors, the person responsible would pay: $25 for
spelling mistakes, the same for hyphens after words ending in -ly
(highly-sought, for example).
   The fines would come from the money budgeted for their raises.
   ``The editors? They were appalled and astounded,'' DeGarmo
recalled. ``But all the so-called positive reinforcement hadn't
worked.''
   How serious was DeGarmo? Ask senior editor Michael Maren, who
had a $600 lesson in how to spell epitaph, guerrilla and
prestigious, among other words.
   After watching DeGarmo take a big bite of his money, Maren was
apologetic.
   ``We probably didn't check things as carefully as we should
have,'' he told The Wall Street Journal.
   DeGarmo's approach has paid off in more than one way. In
addition to collecting $625, he has not seen a glitch in copy since
Nov. 29.
   ``It's not enough to ask people to do their best,'' DeGarmo
said. ``You've got to tell them what you want; in my case, it was
perfection.''

<HEAD>AP Stringer Honored by Federal Judges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Longtime reporter and Associated Press stringer
Milt Sosin was honored Dec. 19 by federal judges who named the
courthouse press room after him.
   A plaque and a framed newspaper profile of Sosin were unveiled
at a surprise ceremony led by Chief U.S. District Judge James
Lawrence King.
   King said Sosin had pestered the judges for a press room so
often when the courthouse was under construction that they
threatened to name the office after him - and 18 years later
finally did.
   Judges and editors told stories from Sosin's career, which has
spanned nearly 60 years, including covering the African theater in
World War II, the first manned U.S. space flights, the Cuban
revolution, the assassination of President Kennedy, including an
eyewitness view of the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald, and most
recently Manuel Noriega's drug case.
   Along with working for the AP as a staff member in New York and
a stringer in Miami, Sosin spent much of his career writing for The
Miami News. He won't say his age.
   Former News columnist John Keasler recounted the story of an
editor who was preparing an elaborate plan to deploy the staff for
major news events and asked Sosin's then-editor Howard Kleinberg
how he would handle a hurricane.
   ``Give Sosin a roll of quarters for the pay phone and send him
where the wind is,'' Kleinberg responded.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman remembered a reporter
complaining about the pope's first visit to Miami because the news
media couldn't get close enough to the podium to ask questions.
   ``Then the pope stepped to the microphone and when he stepped
aside, Milt was right behind him,'' the judge said.
   Sosin said the dedication ceremony caught him by surprise.
   ``It's the first time I've ever been scooped,'' he joked.

   NBC News will have exclusive U.S. rights to all Japanese and
international news material of NTV, Japan's largest private
broadcast network, NBC said.
   In return, NTV, with which NBC has had a working relationship
for almost 40 years, will get exclusive rights to news material
from the NBC News Channel, the 24-hour affiliates' news service
that NBC will start on New Year's Day.
   The Japanese network will be the News Channel's first overseas
affiliate, NBC said.
   The agreement comes at a time when NBC, CBS and ABC's news
divisions are trying to reduce costs of their overseas news
operations by sharing the costs and coverage with foreign
broadcasters or selling them news material.
   Their efforts have been given fresh impetus by high costs of the
Persian Gulf crisis and a flat advertising market this fall.
   Last September, CBS News and Tokyo Broadcasting System said they
would combine their resources and technology for worldwide
newsgathering, starting in April. The deal gives TBS exclusive
rights in Japan to CBS News material.
   In October, ABC News and Worldwide Television News, a
London-based television news agency in which ABC has an 80 percent
interest, signed a non-exclusive agreement to provide Fuji TV with
U.S. and international news.
   Under the CBS-TBS agreement, that Japanese network also got
exclusive rights to some news programs, among them the ``CBS
Evening News.''
   Under the agreement between NBC and Nippon, the Japanese network
can continue excerpting reports from the ``NBC Nightly News'' and
the ``Today'' show, said Peggy Hubble, a spokeswoman for NBC News.
   The two programs are distributed internationally by Visnews,
another London-based TV news agency in which NBC has an interest of
nearly 38 percent.

<HEAD>Canadian Network Facing Hard Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pink slips go out next month for about 1,000
employees of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the government-owned
network many see as the glue that holds together this vast and
diverse nation of 26 million people.
   The bad news comes from budget-cutters who are slashing 10
percent of the corporation's staff, closing television stations and
reducing services.
   Their goal is to make up a projected shortfall of $91 million in
next year's $935 million budget.
   Declining advertising revenues, reduced government funding and
rising TV production costs have hurt the network deeply. About 75
percent of production costs comes from the government.
   Angry public protests have occurred from Newfoundland to Ontario
to the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec over what many feel are cuts in
one of the few things that make Canadians really different from
Americans.
   The CBC will cut 1,100 of its nearly 11,000 permanent positions,
effective April 5.
   In announcing the cutbacks and closures Dec. 5, CBC President
Gerard Veilleux said they were permanent and would not be reversed
even if there is a turn in the 54-year-old corporation's economic
fortunes.
   A major element in the cost-saving program was closure of three
television stations entirely and reducing eight others to small
news reporting bureaus feeding their reports into regional and
national centers.
   The CBC also announced it no longer will operate the
parliamentary channel, which broadcasts debate in the House of
Commons, or Radio Canada International, the shortwave service that
broadcasts in 14 languages abroad.
   Iqbal Rahemtulla, a spokesman for the corporation, said the
House of Commons may take over the funding of the parliamentary
broadcast and the Ministry of External Affairs, because of
international ramifications, is considering ways to maintain Radio
Canada International's services.
   If all that wasn't bad enough, the CBC's projections show that
there will be another shortfall of about $42 million in the 1992-93
budget.
   Emerging relatively unscathed, except for a 1 percent budget
reduction, is CBC Radio, broadcasting in both French and English to
every Canadian in this gigantic country.
   The radio, which carries no advertising, features news, current
events, talk shows and music to a wide range of audiences on both
AM and FM. Its Northern Service also broadcasts in English, French
and eight native languages and dialects.

<TEXT>
   Some satellite dish owners in Central and South
America no longer will get Cable News Network for free.
   Turner Broadcasting System said Dec. 20 that it will begin
scrambling its CNN feed south of the border next month.
   The company said it will make the switch when it begins beaming
the Turner Network Television movie channel to the region on a
scrambled signal. TBS said the dish owners were receiving the news
service illegally for two years.
   TBS feeds its 24-hour news channel to about 35,000 hotel rooms
and 250,000 homes in the region and sells its signal to about 35
broadcast clients, TV stations and networks.
   South American satellite dish owners who want to continue
receiving CNN would have to buy a receiver and decoder from an
equipment company, at a cost of about $1,300, and then enter a
contract with CNN to unscramble the feed.
   Although CNN does not now contract with individuals, spokeswoman
Kitsy Riggall said the company would ``certainly work with anybody
who wants to receive it.''
   TBS said it was concerned about ``weak copyright laws in the
region.'' It has been scrambling its signal in the United States
for five years.
   The company said it has no plans to scramble CNN's signal to the
rest of the world.

<HEAD>Man Who Appeared on `Geraldo' Sues Show for $28 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who appeared on ``Geraldo'' sued the host,
Geraldo Rivera, and a producer Dec. 20 for $28 million, claiming
they revealed his identity after promising not to do so.
   Carl J. Ober said in his lawsuit that he appeared on a segment
of the syndicated television show titled ``Telephone Terror,'' with
women who were victimized by telephone harassment.
   Ober, from Albany, appeared as an alleged telephone harasser
under a written and verbal agreement with Rivera that his identity
would not be revealed, the lawsuit said.
   On at least two occasions during the show, Rivera called him
``Carl'' and on at least two other occasions referred to him as
Carl Ober, the lawsuit said.
   The show aired Feb. 15, 1990.
   The lawsuit said Rivera disclosed Ober's occupation and place of
residence and identified a psychologist who is treating him.
   The lawsuit said that on at least four occasions, Ober's face
was shown with the words, ``Made obscene phone calls,'' and Rivera
called him a ``sick person'' who ``verbally raped'' women.
   The show had no immediate response to the lawsuit.
   Named as defendants in the lawsuit are: Rivera; a producer,
Marilyn Kaskel; and the Investigative News Group Inc., Rivera's
production company.
   The lawsuit said Ober suffered ``ridicule, embarrassment,
vexation, humiliation, mental and emotional distress.''

   The explosion and fire early Dec. 19 destroyed the home of

   Less than a year after Deborah Norville
succeeded Jane Pauley on NBC's ``Today'' show, network sources are
speculating that national correspondent Katie Couric will replace
her, a published report said.
   Don Browne, executive vice president of NBC News, denied the

   Ms. Couric is scheduled to substitute for Ms. Norville when she

   ``She's no substitute - she's the successor,'' an unidentified
source told TV Guide in its Dec. 29 issue. ``Deborah's a bright
woman, but she doesn't come across that way on camera. She comes
across as plastic. Katie's real.''
   Ms. Couric joined NBC in 1989 as deputy Pentagon correspondent.
She has filled in several times as weekend anchor of ``NBC Nightly

<HEAD>Public Television News Magazine Renewed After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public television station KCET reversed
itself Dec. 18 and decided to renew ``South Africa Now'' after a
conservative media group that fought the show filed papers
challenging the station's license.
   The station's decision came one day after the Committee on Media
Integrity asked the Federal Communications Commission to deny
renewal of KCET's license and a request for a new transmitter.
   Group spokesman David Horowitz offered to withdraw the challenge
if the station established an elected board of directors and hired
an ombudsman.
   KCET President William Kobin called the demands preposterous and
part of a longstanding effort to control the station.
   ``South Africa Now,'' which covers issues in that country from a
black perspective, was canceled in October after KCET judged it did
not meet journalistic standards for objectivity.
   The program is scheduled for Sundays at 9 a.m. The station said
it will run with a disclaimer identifying it as a ``point of view''

<TEXT>
   The government on Dec. 18 cleared a merger between
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting.
Opposition parties immediately criticized the decision.
   ``It is detrimental to the public interest that Sky should be
allowed to establish a satellite television monopoly without
penalty,'' said Labor lawmaker Robin Corbett, the party's spokesman
on broadcasting matters.
   Sky Television, which had four channels, and BSB, which had
five, announced the merger in early November to stem mounting
losses from both operations.
   The renamed, five-channel British Sky Broadcasting, is 50
percent owned by Murdoch's News International and 50 percent by
BSB's existing shareholders, the publishers Pearson PLC and Reed
International PLC, the entertainment company Granada Group PLC, and
the French conglomerate Chargeurs SA.
   Until the launch of Sky in 1989, Britain had four land-based
channels. BSB began operating earlier this year.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms FCC Decision To Pull Radio Station's License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Fredonia, N.Y., radio station owner accused
of discriminatory hiring and of holding a contest in which he kept
the prize lost a bid Dec. 20 to renew his license.
   The Federal Communications Commission decided in March 1989 not
to renew Catoctin Broadcasting Corp.'s license for the 250-watt
station, WBUZ-AM. Owner Henry Serafin appealed the decision to the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   ``We defer to the commission's expertise and judgment,'' a
three-judge panel of the court wrote.
   This was the first time in a decade that the FCC had pulled a
license on character grounds. Only about 100 stations have lost
their licenses since the FCC was founded in 1934.
   Serafin, who learned of the decision from The Associated Press,
said he did not know what he would do next.
   ``I'm in shock right now,'' he said from the station, about 30
miles south of Buffalo. ``I have to take a day or two to think this
thing out.''
   In 1981, Catoctin's application to renew its license was
challenged by the Chautauqua County Rural Ministry Inc.; the
Dunkirk, N.Y., chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; and the local branch of the League
of Women Voters.
   Among the charges against Serafin was that he had discriminated
against a black job applicant in 1980.
   In running a contest at the station in 1982, Serafin also
allegedly kept the grand prize, a stereo system, for himself, and
gave another prize, a trip to Niagara Falls, to a favored
advertiser.
   In addition, Serafin repeatedly refused to make Catoctin's
public file available to citizens. The file contains a station's
filings with the FCC and citizen complaints.

   Miami Herald Executive Editor Janet Chusmir, who
traded a housewife's apron for a climb to journalism's heights
reached by few women of her generation, died Dec. 22 of a brain
aneurism. She was 60.
   ``We have lost a great friend and a great editor,'' said
Publisher David Lawrence. ``What zest she had for good newspapers,
what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right
and fair for everyone. She set a wonderful example.''
   Last month, the National Press Foundation unanimously selected
her as Editor of the Year for ``transforming the Herald to serve
the unique multicultural population of greater Miami.''
   She came to the business late, after raising a family. Fourteen
years after graduating college with a journalism degree, Chusmir
began her career working for $2.50 a story for the now defunct
Miami Beach Daily Sun in 1963.
   She was hired by the Herald in 1968 and soon had a regular
column. She was named assistant managing editor for features in
1977, and in 1982 Knight-Ridder Newspapers named her publisher and
president of the Camera in Boulder, Colo. She returned to the
Herald as executive editor in 1987 and the paper won two Pulitzer
Prizes under her guidance.
   One of those Pulitzers went to humor columnist Dave Barry, who
remembered Chusmir fondly as an editor who often stopped by in the
newsroom ``to talk, to laugh, to gossip.''
   ``I'm not suggesting that, just because she was a warm and
generous person, she was also some kind of pushover. She was most
definitely not,'' Barry said at funeral services attended by about
500 mourners Dec. 23.
   Barry described her as ``the heart of the Herald.''
   ``She was a rock, a solid center, an unfailing fountain of
qualities that are in desperately short supply these days - sanity,
humor, fairness, graciousness, wisdom. She was the best,'' he said.
   In Boulder, John L. Dotson Jr., publisher of the Camera, said:
``Janet left an imprint on everything she touched. The Camera today
is one legacy of her creativity and energy. Many of the innovations
she instituted continue to be featured and many of the staffers are
here today because of her.''

   In Sunday's plebiscite, 88.2 percent voted for secession, and
thousands celebrated the results in the Slovenian capital of
Ljubljana by dancing in the streets and uncorking champagne.
   Four percent voted against secession, and the remainder of the
ballots were invalid, according to final unofficial results
provided by political parties.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal workers everywhere, from Vice
President Dan Quayle to the troops in the Persian Gulf to the
groundskeepers at the White House, will pocket fatter paychecks in
the new year.
   There's one exception to the rule: President Bush. His salary
stays frozen at $200,000, right where it has been for the last 22
years and five presidencies.
   For several million rank-and-file workers, both military and
civilian, the pay raise is a flat 4.1 percent. But thousands of top
federal executives are getting big raises, on the scale of $20,000
to $30,000, thanks to a 1989 law that lifted the lid on salaries.
   The Constitution precludes raising - or lowering - the
president's pay during his term, so Bush has no immediate prospects
for a salary hike.

   MOUNT VERNON, Mo. (AP) - Ten days ago, the Rev. Ted Coleman
thought removing Nancy Cruzan's feeding tube was immoral and cruel.
   But the chaplain at the clinic where the woman lies after nearly
eight years in a persistent vegetative state told his congregation
Sunday that now he's not so sure her parents were wrong to fight
for her right to die.
   ``I'm struggling like I've never had to struggle before,''
Coleman told parishioners at the First Christian Church (Disciples
of Christ).
   Coleman, 51, doubles as chaplain at the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center, where Ms. Cruzan is in a vegetative state doctors say is
irreversible. The 33-year-old woman remained in deteriorating
condition late Sunday.
   ---&equals;
   CHICAGO (AP) - For many, Christmas is a time of peace and
religious celebration, but for atheists it can be a time to protest
Nativity scenes in city halls or crosses in parks.
   Many such symbols of religion overlapping into secular society
are disappearing as activists work year-round to build a stronger
wall between church and state.
   Some targets are obscure, like the notice for a church event
posted on a park district's community event board. Others can't be
missed, such as the ``God Reigns'' motto blazoned in a city seal
across a 136-foot water tower.
   ``I don't go out trolling for crosses. But often people will see
a display and, if it offends them, they'll call me,'' Robert I.
Sherman, national spokesman for American Atheists Inc.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - From a terrifying murder rate to appalling
infant mortality, Sharon Pratt Dixon will confront problems that
would daunt the nation's savviest public official when she becomes
mayor of the nation's capital.
   But the woman who takes office Jan. 2, is the very opposite of
an experienced government bureaucrat. And her response to the
challenges will set the tone for life in a city anxious for an end
to turbulence after outgoing Mayor Marion Barry's highly publicized
drug and legal difficulties.
   Dixon, 46 and a former utility company executive, swept to
victory in November in her first-ever political campaign. She had
been the first candidate to call on Barry to give up his job, and
campaigned on a pledge to root out waste and corruption in city
government.

<HEAD>Read Her Lips: Bulletins From Mary-Chapin Carpenter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary-Chapin Carpenter writes true stories.
   Her characters are single women, like herself. They're breaking
up with a boyfriend or maybe just thinking about one from long ago.
They like to dance and they like quiet moments, just talking on the
phone with a close friend.
   She named her second album ``State of the Heart,'' and the songs
lived up to it, a roulette wheel of emotions from lust to regret.
``Shooting Straight in the Dark'' is her new record, but Carpenter
thinks ``Human Behavior'' might have worked better as a title.
   ``A lot of the tunes are about human behavior, knee-jerk
reactions to certain things,'' Carpenter said during an interview.
``Many are about me, not so much about me but about feelings that I
have and observations in people I know.''
   ``If I'd actually have to choose, I'd have to say I like
non-fiction more than fiction,'' she said. ``I like biographies;
I'm a history buff. I've never been able to get into science
fiction or fantasy. I like things that are real.''
   Carpenter tells of women frightened by love and frightened of
being alone. Sometimes they get angry. In ``The More Things
Change,'' a woman hears an old boyfriend is running round town and
can't help remarking, ``Only the names have changed.''
   Other times, they let go. ``Down at the Twist and Shout'' is an
old-fashioned Saturday night dance song, a release from all that
tension. In ``Going Out Tonight,'' the woman is by herself - but
not for long. She has empty arms and perfume on her wrist. When she
leaves her apartment, her ``meddling heart'' will stay behind.
   ``She's basically saying, `I've had enough of this mourning.'
It's almost a mercenary kind of thing; she's going out of spite,''
Carpenter said.
   ``That's the one song that was co-written with (co-producer)
John Jennings. We really went at each other from a male-female kind
of thing. He came with what I thought were male ways of looking at
it and I had a female way of looking at it.''
   Musically, Carpenter mixes country, folk and rock 'n' roll. The
lyrics are simple, conversational, like excerpts from a diary.
There are no metaphors or any other devices to draw attention to
the writer. Precise details - the color of a shirt - are what
matter, just taking a series of facts and emotions and shaping them
into a story.
   ``I personally feel the best satisfaction I can get after
working on a tune is using the most succinct language, concrete
images, not being too obtuse. I don't like too many far-flung
images. I just wanted to be as accurate and direct as possible,''
she said.
   ``With some writers I want to pull that curtain away. I've
always been more drawn to writers who are concrete, people like Guy
Clark. I also like Bruce Cockburn. He's a very literate, direct
writer.''
   Carpenter was born in Princeton, N.J., but spent most of her
childhood in Washington, D.C. She listened to her sisters' Beatles
and Motown records and by age 9 was playing guitar and scribbling
down poems.
   She was 19 when she first started performing, appearing on open
mike nights at a local bar. After graduating from Brown University,
she continued playing at bars in Washington and eventually gathered
enough material to make a demo.
   Columbia Records signed her, and her debut album, ``Hometown
Girl,'' came out in 1987. ``State of the Heart'' was released last
year.
   Fame has brushed against her and quickly sped away. On her first
record, she covered Tom Waits' ``Downtown Train'' and was surprised
to hear it in a Washington mall last year; she was listening to Rod
Stewart's hit version.
   In 1988, she wrote the sexy ``Read My Lips'' and, to her horror,
the same phrase became George Bush's campaign theme for not raising
taxes. (The promise of Carpenter's words has held up longer).
   But her own name may soon be good enough. ``State of the Heart''
produced four hits on the country charts and ``You Win Again'' is a
hit off the new album. She also received a standing ovation at this
year's Country Music Association awards ceremony for the not so
tongue-in-cheek ``Opening Act.''
   ``The Moon and St. Christopher,'' off her new album, is her most
personal song, a story so true it almost frightened her off. The
character can only be Carpenter, and she's pouring a lifetime of
confessions into 4 minutes and 21 seconds.
   ``I pray for the heart and nerve,'' she sings. She kicks herself
for being ``such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times.'' She
regrets the times she ran from lovers and friends.
   If her other songs are bulletins from the front, updates on
women seeking middle ground, then ``The Moon and St. Christopher''
is a prayer that all the battles are worth fighting, a moment of
reflection before picking herself up and giving the world another
chance.
   ``The tune basically happened because a friend of mine had some
news that changed his life and kind of changedmine. Those things
force you to examine who you are, why you ended up the way you are,
what your failures were,'' she said.
   ``I feel kind of exposed by that song and it's very scary in a
way. But it's also about the most satisfying thing I wrote because
I really got down to the nitty-gritty. People tend to come up to
you and tell you they got it. They related to it. It makes me think
the more personal it is, the more universal.''

<HEAD>`Matters of the Heart' - USA Network Movie Plays an Old Score, But
Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Young pianist falls in love with his
beautiful, world- famous instructor'' is the one-line synopsis of
``Matters of the Heart,'' a made-for-cable movie premiering tonight
on the USA Network.
   It's accurate but not true, as they say, and does a disservice
to an unabashed romance that stars Jane Seymour, who seems only to
grow more beautiful as she matures and lends new grace to the term
``middle-aged.''
   She's the soul of this movie in her role as world-class pianist
Hadley Norman, a lonely, troubled woman who seeks to compose and
drink in seclusion in a gritty little upstate New York town.
   Seymour shows courage as an actress in her first scenes,
allowing herself to be photographed looking like an unmade bed.
She's pale, without makeup, her hair is stringy and unkempt and she
wears a ratty bathrobe.
   Director Michael Rhodes in one brief, throwaway shot, also shows
us that she's a woman who likes cigarettes, instant coffee and gin
handy when she works.
   The other half of the romance is Steven Harper (Chris Gartin), a
gifted young pianist stranded in his hometown because he can't
afford music school. He looks ahead and sees only an eternity of
work in his father's hardware store.
   We spend most of the movie's early scenes with Steven, who's at
loggerheads with his father (excellently acted by James Stacy), an
embittered man who lost an arm and leg in Vietnam.
   Instead of encouraging his son's passionate musical ambitions,
the father is hostile to them. Gartin never overplays his
18-year-old character's angst and frustration. It's a much more
powerful performance because of that control.
   When Steven approaches her for an autograph, her wretched
appearance and harsh, neurotic behavior are off-putting. His
worship of her artistic ability changes into concern for her as a
person.
   As Steven tries to break down the barriers between them, showing
her his passion for the music, so too does Hadley lower her guard.
Finally she consents to teach him and he flourishes.
   The dynamics of their relationship begin to evolve. His growing
confidence and musicianship let him see her as a woman, and her see
him as a man. A rising glissando of sexual tension turns into a
emotional and physical involvement.
   Note: There is some of what is charmingly called ``partial
nudity,'' but it's nothing you wouldn't see at a beach. The
lovemaking and pillow talk we see have an intimacy and sexy
tenderness that can only be called healthy.
   As their love affair intensifies, Steven matures as an artist
and as a man. Hadley seems happy at last; and yet, there is an
ominous note in all this that's not audible in the background
music. ...
   And speaking of music, there's lots of luscious Mozart, Chopin,
and Tchaikovsky in the sound track thanks to Mona Golabek, a
world-class pianist who coached the actors on keyboard technique
and performed many of the solos.
   Kudos also to the tremendously talented James Stacy, a longtime
character actor who plays the disabled father with a special fire
and pain.
   Not every viewer will realize that there is no clever makeup
effect or stand-in at work: Stacy actually is disabled. His
impairments may limit the roles he can play, but not his range.
   The strengths of ``Matters of the Heart'' are its actors. They
create people who are recognizable and human, and their
relationships begin, evolve and end.
   What weakens the movie is that co-writers Linda Bergman and
Martin Tahse's plot devices are shopworn. You'll say, ``Aha! The
old lost dog to reunite the lovers gag! Surely here we'll see a
clever twist on the old, old story!''
   You will wait in vain for such higher designs.
   There's even one unforgivable scene in which the lovers frolic
in the snow, affectionately lobbing snowballs at each other. It
looks like a chewing gum commercial. Do you suppose the director
said, ``OK, kids, rollick!''
   ``Matters of the Heart'' is not sophisticated; it doesn't
advance the art of romance. Who cares? It's the day after
Christmas. Tuck the kids away. Put on your new bathrobe and bunny
slippers and curl up with someone cuddly.
   Surely matters of the heart deserve some attention tonight.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE DRAMA IN TELEVISION NEWS: Barbara Eden and Heather Locklear
star on New Year's Day in the made-for-CBS movie ``Her Wicked
Ways,'' which is billed as a contemporary drama of
behind-the-scenes power struggles in broadcast news.
   Miss Eden plays ``a respected television network White House
correspondent who is next in line for the all-important network
anchor chair.'' Miss Locklear plays an ambitious reporter whose
devious machinations threaten all that.
   Miss Eden, a clever comedian beloved for her work in ``I Dream
of Jeannie,'' is cast here in a fantasy without comedy. Miss
Locklear, well-known for her work on ``Dynasty'' and ``T.J.
Hooker,'' has her work cut out for her.

<HEAD>Paradise Cost: Murders, Rising Crime In Once-Quiet Northwest
County</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORT ORCHARD, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant sheriff Chuck Wheeler
remembers when a crime wave in rural Kitsap County consisted of
punks breaking into a few empty summer homes.
   Now reports of murder, rape and assault crowd his desk, and
Wheeler has little time for petty burglary. Emergency calls to 911
have soared 160 percent since 1980. The caseload has doubled at
Superior Court, where prosecutors share desks in a cramped,
obsolete building.
   One of the nation's few boom areas is battling something people
used to move here to escape - crime. This once-peaceful corner of
Puget Sound is waking up to big-city woes never dreamed of 10 years
ago.
   ``Back then, if we had one or two murders a year, that was
big,'' Wheeler said. ``Last year we had nine, and they were all
bizarre.''
   While much of the nation grapples with recession, Kitsap County
remains economically strong. Its low unemployment and reputation as
a scenic, affordable place to live have made it one of the
Northwest's fastest-growing counties.
   But there's a flip side. The crime rate is soaring even faster
than the population. Courts are clogged, sheriff's deputies are
stretched dangerously thin, and old-timers are left wondering what
happened to their piece of paradise.
   ``It's not the sleepy little rural county that it used to be,''
said County Clerk Bob Freudenstein, a 40-year resident. ``I myself
have been burglarized two times in the last four years.''
   Kitsap County spreads across the forested hills and placid
saltwater coves of the Kitsap Peninsula, an arrowhead-shaped chunk
of land jutting into Puget Sound.
   For years, the sound acted as a moat around the county, fending
off the urban sprawl of Seattle across the water. But now, as
highways between booming Seattle and its landlocked suburbs clog
with commuters, a half-hour ferry ride seems less inconvenient.
Kitsap County's Bainbridge Island has filled with ferry commuters.
   Central Kitsap County, meanwhile, has built a thriving economy
around the Navy, which runs a Trident submarine base at Bangor and
a shipyard in Bremerton, the county's biggest city.
   Signs of growth are everywhere. Fresh ranks of condominiums
march up hills around the 128-store Kitsap Mall, which opened in
1985. Placards announcing new housing plats pop up like mushrooms
along back roads. County population, now 188,800, has jumped 28
percent since 1980.
   Also growing are demands on law enforcement, but the sheriff's
department hasn't kept pace. Despite recent hires, the 85-officer
department still has fewer officers per residents than any other
Washington county.
   County officials say more money would help them handle rising
crime, but taxpayers are cool to such proposals. In November,
voters rejected a $31 million bond for a new courthouse.
   Bainbridge Island residents carried the snub even further. They
voted to annex their entire island to the on-island town of Winslow
and run their affairs locally, instead of relying on county
officials far away in Port Orchard, the county seat.
   Islanders hope to beef up their police force and enforce zoning
more strictly to head off development.
   ``We think we can retain the island's rurality,'' said Norm
Wooldridge, a leader of the island revolt. ``The county wasn't
doing a very good job of it.''
   Wheeler attributes some of the excess crime to burglaries in
poorly patrolled outlying areas. But an increase in violent crime,
notably 26 homicides since 1987, ``has baffled me for a long
time,'' he said.
   1989 was especially bloody. In January, a man was shot to death
by four teen-agers who had waited at his home, calmly discussing
how to kill him. In March, three youths were killed as they sat in
a pickup truck on a Bainbridge Island road. In April, a drifter
raped an 83-year-old woman, then beat her to death with a coffee
pot and whiskey bottle.
   Investigating such crime straps an already overworked sheriff's
department. Lesser crimes, especially those without leads, often
are shoved aside, Wheeler said.
   That was obvious to Bob and Evelyn Linden, who awoke one morning
to find their house burglarized. A stereo, knife and clock worth
$2,000 were gone. The Bainbridge Island couple reported the theft
immediately, but no officer showed up. They called again a week
later. Still, nobody showed. Mr. Linden complained to a county
commissioner.
   ``A detective called and said they couldn't show up for some
little burglary,'' Mrs. Linden recalled. ``We told him we were in
the house at the time, and he said, `Oh, that's different.' He said
he'd be right out.
   ``That was three years ago,'' she said. ``He never did come.''

<HEAD>Disabled Vets Start New Year Without Benefit Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disabled veterans start the new year without
any cost-of-living increase in benefits, but key members of
Congress have pledged to change that.
   ``I've talked to the speaker and he feels very strongly and told
me to be sure the COLA increase gets into the March checks of the
veterans,'' said Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, the chairman of
the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   An omnibus veterans bill that included the cost-of-living
increase died in the last Congress because of a dispute over
benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange.
   The bill would have required an outside panel to examine
scientific evidence to determine if there are links between the
dioxin-contaminated herbicide and health problems experience by
Vietnam veterans.
   The legislation provided for a 5.4 percent increase in benefits
for the 2.2 million veterans and 300,000 widows or children that
receive the disability payments. That's the same cost-of-living
increase that Social Security recipients will receive.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has told Montgomery, D-Miss.,
to move quickly to get disabled veterans a cost-of-living increase.
   ``They'll be beating each over the heads to get to that one,''
said Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the Republican whip whose
objections blocked a vote on the veterans bill.
   Monthly disability benefits now range from $76 to $1,537, based
on a disability scale that runs from 10 percent to 100 percent.
Payments may be higher, up to $2,679, for multiple disabilities
involving loss of limbs, sight or hearing.
   Even if a bill passes quickly, veterans won't get their increase
until March, but the increase would be made retroactive to Jan. 1.
The question is what role the Agent Orange dispute will have.
   ``The people who are polarized on this issue, there's a handful
of them,'' said John Heilman, national legislative director of the
Disabled American Veterans. ``They were willing to put our
entitlements at risk. That tail should not be wagging the entire
dog.''
   Other veterans groups and lawmakers who have fought for official
recognition of a connection between Agent Orange exposure and a
variety of diseases say they will resist efforts to enact a
cost-of-living bill free of Agent Orange provisions. They are less
than sanguine, however.
   ``I'm not optimistic that we've got the votes,'' said Paul S.
Egan, legislative director for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``I think the only game in town is the linkage between the COLA
and the Agent Orange,'' he said.
   Egan is worried about the makeup of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, which in October overruled Montgomery's opposition and
voted for Agent Orange provisions. It was a breakthrough vote in
the 12-year-struggle by Vietnam veterans' advocates.
   On the Senate side, Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., supports the Agent Orange provisions. Several
key supporters, led by Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., promise they
will try to force a vote on the Agent Orange issue.
   But even there, the pressure by older veterans is strong. Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., has told veterans in his home state he will
introduce a COLA bill free of Agent Orange provisions.
   ``I've been meeting with veterans groups in Florida, and I
haven't found very many who liked what Congress did this year as
relates to the cost of living increase,'' he said. ``It has caused
a great deal of anxiety and anger.''
   His state is home to 140,000 disabled veterans.

<HEAD>Goodbye to Tax Deductibility of Personal Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the New Year's clamor is over, consumer
borrowers will face a somewhat harsher tax environment, one in
which the helping hand of Uncle Sam will have been removed.
   No longer will any part of personal interest payments be
deductible on income tax returns.
   It isn't a small matter. A total of $737.4 billion in such loans
were outstanding in September, and the monthly totals were rising
steadily since last March. Moreover, rates on these loans generally
are the highest.
   The demise of personal interest tax deductions has been little
noted of late because, in a sense, it is old news. As late as the
mid-1980s, all such interest was deductible, but then Congress
changed the rules.
   With the tax reform legislation of 1986, personal interest
deductions were phased out, falling to only 10 percent of the total
this year. Next year, none of that interest - on credit cards, car
loans, revolving credit - can be deducted.
   In certain respects, the demise of the deduction can be viewed
as one of the first attempts at reducing America's emphasis on
consumption over production, which was a major issue of the 1980s.
   That old emphasis, some critics say, led to the assumption of
too much credit, cut into savings rates, denied industrial America
domestic funds for expansion and improvement, and even helped
worsen the foreign payments balance.
   It was in such a mood that Congress decided on the phaseout.
Lower the tax benefits, it was reasoned, and people will cut back
on their use of credit. That faith was misplaced; personal loans
continued to climb.
   In fact, so strong have they been been that banks and other
lenders have seen little reason to seek customers by lowering
interest rates. Today, with rates in general falling, most personal
loan rates remain very high.
   Some bank cards, for example, still charge close to 20 percent,
even more. A finance company was accused in New York recently of
deceptively promoting loans at an annual rate of close to 25
percent.
   Of the total outstanding, commercial banks have about $350
billion and finance companies more than $140 billion, with the rest
split among credit unions, retailers, savings institutions,
gasoline companies, and organizations that buy pools of loans from
the original lenders.
   Why did loan demand remain high in spite of the lost
deductibility? The answer isn't clear, but some students of
consumer behavior say the penalty just wasn't enough to convince
borrowers to adjust to simpler lifestyles.
   Meanwhile, the home equity loan added to household debt burdens
by allowing deductions of most interest on loans to $100,000 taken
out after Oct. 13, 1987. The loans needn't be home-related; you can
use the money to buy a car.
   Thus, the intent of Congress in removing personal interest
deductibility was largely undermined by the home equity provision,
which allowed borrowers to simply transfer credit-card debt to
deductible status.
   One assumption made at the time was that homeowners, most of
them good credit risks to begin with, would prudently avoid
endangering their home ownership.
   Whether they have been prudent is open t question. Fears exists
that a recession with high unemployment could mean foreclosures.
And declines in values could worsen the predicament for borrowers
and lenders alike.
   The brighter side of the picture is that some personal interest
rates might decline. Might, that is, if consumer demand for loans
slackens.

<HEAD>What A Year: Olympics, Super Bowl - and Jane Fonda, Too</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winning the Olympics alone would have given
Atlanta reason to crow this year. But then the heavyweight
championship? And what about landing a Super Bowl? And a spot on
the ``most liveable'' list? And now - grits meets glitz! - Jane
Fonda, too?
   This city's triumphs finally gave substance to its boosters' old
nickname. In 1990, it was ``Hotlanta,'' indeed.
   True, the Olympics fireworks burst over a city that would pass a
curfew to save its children from drug dealers. True, the mayor had
to challenge preliminary census figures indicating his city was
losing people.
   But even if the ticker tape snowed on a cooling economy and on
troubles common to urban area, Atlanta celebrated as it hadn't
since the curtain went up on ``Gone With the Wind'' half a century
ago.
   In September, a few months after being picked as the site of pro
football's 1994 Super Bowl, dark horse Atlanta beat out Athens,
Greece, as host for the 1996 summer Olympic games. The confetti was
barely swept up when hometowner Evander Holyfield brought boxing's
heavyweight title to the city tagged Losersville for its sorry
teams.
   Billboards around the nation's 13th largest metropolitan area
saluted hard work and chutzpah. Headlines hollered, ``It's
Atlanta!'' On sidewalks and in grocery lines, natives beamed.
   At the Atlanta Historical Society, executive director John Ott
didn't know of another time when two parades had streamed down
Peachtree Street within six weeks.
   ``It may make Atlantans like Texans: you know, `We're the best,
we're the greatest, we're the biggest,''' he said. ``We do have the
sense that we have the wherewithal to capture things.''
   ``A City of Dreams,'' proclaimed Atlanta magazine - profiling
its own parade of locals who realized grand visions, from Martin
Luther King Jr. to Ted Turner.
   The latter's Atlanta-based Cable News Network, which many credit
with raising the city's profile, marked its 10th anniversary in
1990. And in December, Ted and Jane (Fonda, that is), whose causes
and caresses filled the daily people columns, announced their
engagement.
   Along the way, there were high marks for Atlanta from arbiters
as different as the Population Crisis Committee (tied for second
highest score on list of world's most liveable cities) and the
Fortune Industrial Survey (first among executives' likely picks for
future plant sites).
   Only three U.S. cities attract more conventioneers, and
Atlanta's high profile this year will only enhance that, said John
Jackson, vice president of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau.
   ``A few years ago I was in London ... and a gentlemn told me we
needed to get our boardwalks fixed. People associated Atlanta with
Atlantic City,'' Jackson said. ``That's not going to happen
anymore. Atlanta is on the world map.''
   The 1988 Democratic National Convention provided a smaller-scale
dress rehearsal for events the city is now committed to staging, he
said, adding that Atlanta managed the attention well then. Some
15,000 reporters descended on the city and ``95 percent or more of
the stories were positive.''
   In 1989, however, Atlanta led the nation's large cities in
serious crime, according to FBI statistics. Even though the city
has shed that dubious distinction as crime figures declined this
year, some reporters continue to cite it, said Angelo Fuster, press
secretary for Mayor Maynard Jackson. ``It's terribly frustrating,''
he said.
   In November, the City Council restored a curfew for children 16
and under that hadn't been in effect in nearly a decade, prompted
earlier by the so-called ``Atlanta child murders'' cases. In
calling for a new curfew, a sponsor cited killings in her district,
including that of a 4-year-old girl.
   Civil libertarians doubted the curfew was constitutional, but
the mayor said it would ``help us fight drugs and protect our
children.''
   City Hall damage controllers went to work after preliminary
figures from the U.S. Census Bureau said Atlanta's population fell
from 425,000 to 384,000 between 1980 and 1990. The city, contending
it had grown to 437,000, said census takers overlooked many, and
undercounted others. It demanded a recount.
   Cracks even began to show in the smiling facade of unanimity
that helped win the Olympics. Residents near the proposed sites of
certain venues protested that their neighborhoods would suffer.
   Some activists worried that officials would try to sweep
lingering problems like homelessness from visitors' view, rather
than working to solve them.
   ``There are blighted neighborhoods in the path of stadiums all
over Atlanta that are going to have to be gentrified,'' complained
Anita Beaty, director of the cty's Task Force for the Homeless,
which counted 47,000 individuals who sought emergency housing last
year.
   Ms. Beaty said she's concerned that money which could go toward
shelter and other needs will instead be used for superficial
beautification. She called for more public involvement in planning.
   ``I'm no longer saying we don't want the Olympics. That's
useless,'' she said. ``I'm saying how can we benefit? ... How can
we manage the impact?''
   The Super Bowl and the Olympics are new chapters in an old story
of self-promotion and courting outsiders that has helped define the
city that grew from a railroad terminus. Torched by Gen. William T.
Sherman in the Civil War, Atlanta adopted the motto, ``Resurgens,''
Latin for ``rising again,'' and never forgot that goal.
   After the Civil War, Atlanta editor and orator Henry Grady
trumpeted a ``New South'' - ``less splendid on the surface but
stronger at the core - a hundred farms for every plantation ... and
a diversified industry that meets the needs of this complex age.''
   Northerners liked what they heard, and Yankee investment poured
in to the New South's capital.
   That typifies Atlanta's style - ``welcome anybody, particularly
if they've got a few dollars,'' said Jack Spalding, former editor
of The Atlanta Journal.
   ``People say, `The Olympics? Good God, how can you handle it?'
'' Spalding said. But he cited precedents, notably a civic showcase
mounted just three decades after Sherman's destruction: the 1895
Cotton States and International Exposition. It attracted 800,000
people, nearly 10 times the city's population.
   Other than to get attention, ``here was absolutely no
justification for it,'' Spalding said, a smile wrinkling his eyes.
``Atlanta's always had a lot of imagination.''

Odds</HEAD>

   Abandoned by her mother, raised in a small, West
Virginia town by an abusive aunt and a lecherous uncle, Elizabeth
didn't seem to have a chance.
   But when her impoverished family couldn't even provide a
bathtub, and a school counselor complained she was dirty, she made
the swim team so she could get a daily shower.
   Too poor to ever dream of owning a clarinet or violin, she
joined the school band anyway, playing whatever instrument the
school had to offer.
   For years, psychologists studied children who crumbled under the
weight of a traumatic upbringing, reinforcing the notion that
abused children become ruined adults.
   But recently they have come to believe that the Elizabeths of
the world - called ``transcenders'' by one researcher - can yield
clues on how to help all kinds of troubled children.
   Lessons learned from transcenders may be used to help those who
can't rise above the circumstances of their lives, said Norman
Watt, a professor of psychology at the University of Denver.
   ``In a sense they are experiments in natural therapy,'' he said.
``The kid whose mom is schizophrenic who still grows to be a Rhodes
scholar may tell us something about how nature works.''
   ``Life for transcenders is often short, sharp and brutish,''
said Karen Northcraft, a psychiatric social worker in Evansville,
Ind., who taped 20 hours of conversations with Elizabeth, the
subject of her doctoral dissertation.
   ``But they do well in situations anyone else would find
crushing,'' she said. ``If they had been born into different
families, they might have been prodigies.''
   Elizabeth told Northcraft of bone-breaking beatings by her aunt,
who she said once stripped her naked and dunked her in a vat of
scalding water. She told of the night when she was 8 that her uncle
got into her bed and sexually molested her for the first time in
what would be five years of assaults.
   Elizabeth's aunt often told her that her mother had sold her for
$25.
   Her battle did not end with grade school. She gained admission
to college and was told she was dyslexic and should drop out. But
she worked her way through school, earned a graduate degree and
became a family therapist.
   What happened? How could she possibly have endured?
   Northcraft said Elizabeth told her the turning point came in the
4th grade. One of her secret pleasures was her long, blonde curls.
When her aunt shaved her head, the well of pride, anger and
determination buried within her broke through.
   ``After that, she was able to reject what her aunt was saying
and start making her life better,'' said Northcraft, who met
Elizabeth through another professor familiar with her work.
   Transcenders are smart, resourceful and independent thinkers.
They all have the potential because of family surroundings to
suffer social or psychological problems, but transcenders seek out
other ways to live, Northcraft said.
   ``They have self-confidence, and early on they think for
themselves,'' Northcraft said. ``They emotionally distance
themselves from their parents, and they choose their actions rather
than do what would be expected in their environment.''
   Northcraft cited one case study of a boy whose schizophrenic
mother thought the family's food was poisoned. The woman's two
daughters believed her delusions and would not touch the food, but
the little boy ate heartily.
   Asked why, he responded, ``Well, I'm not dead yet.''
   The sisters grew up neurotic. The boy went off to college and
was successful and happy.
   In the worst of times, transcenders envision themselves
elsewhere, imaginingthat they can do great things despite their
surroundings, Northcraft said.
   They include all kinds of people, from the very obscure to the
well-known, such as actress Carol Burnett, the daughter of two
alcoholics who as a girl dreamed of someday going to college.
   Richard Rhodes, in his new book ``A Hole in the World: An
American Boyhood,'' details how he and his brother were viciously
abused by their stepmother. He went on to win a Pulitzer Prize.
   And they're like Mary, 25, who grew up with an alcoholic father
who often flew into violent rages.
   ``He'd come home and accuse mom of having affairs,'' she said in
a telephone interview. ``He'd beat up people who drove too fast on
our block.''
   Amid a family life of constant crisis, she felt always
demoralized.
   ``The hardest thing was to emotionally separate myself from the
craziness that went on in my family,'' she said. ``It still goes on
and it still hurts, but when you separate yourself you don't get as
involved with it.''
   She now is at the University of Denver working toward a double
major in psychology and sociology, and maintaining a B average.
   Northcraft said she decided to join the small group of
professors studying transcenders when she found volumes of research
devoted to troubled children but little to those who succeeded.
Most studies on such children have come only in the last 10 to 15
years, she said.
   ``We know much more about the factors for failure then for
success,'' Northcraft said. ``It's become conventional wisdom to
say, `Well, I was battered as a kid, so I'll batter my kids.'''
   Now such attitudes may be changing, said Watt.
   ``The ethos used to be that if your parent was schizophrenic,
the chances you will be, too, are high,'' he said. ``Now that's
changing. We are starting to unlearn that previous message.''
   ``I think this is part of a movement to focus on health rather
than pathology,'' Northcraft said. ``My whole notion is if we can
identify factors that enable transcenders to succeed, then we bring
them to bear on other children at risk.''
   The most important lesson? Any child may be able to transcend a
hurtful home life if just one supportive, stable adult - a teacher,
friend or counselor - is around to help, said Michael Goldstein, a
professor of psychology at UCLA.
   ``One child we studied had a psychotic parent,'' Goldstein
recalls. ``But he built up a relationship with a neighbor who
taught him electronics and how to fix things. The kid went on to
become an engineer and a relatively happy person.''
   Adult transcenders still carry the emotional scars of their
childhoods, said Northcraft, who dubbed them transcenders because
she disliked the moniker some psychologists gave them -
``invulnerable.''
   ``They're very hurt; they do have scars, no matter how
successful they become,'' Northcraft said. ``There are costs.
Transcenders survive in spite of their pain.''
   Elizabeth still hurts, but she has helped heal herself.
   ``I looked into my soul,'' Elizabeth said. ``There is nothing
that I am hiding.''

<HEAD>Struggling Brewery Hopes Better Days Are Returning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time was when 13 breweries bottled beer in
New Orleans for folks to wash down their jambalaya and gumbo.
   Brands like Pelican, Union, Security and Weckerling provided
about 3,000 jobs, making New Orleans the brewing capital of the
South.
   Now the old Falstaff building is little more than decaying
bricks and peeling signs. The Jax brewery in the French Quarter has
been transformed into an upscale shopping mall and tourist
attraction. Only Dixie survives.
   ``I'm committed to not letting this brewery die,'' said Kendra
Elliott Bruno, who bought the struggling brand for an undisclosed
amount in 1985.
   Founded in 1907, Dixie established itself as the frontrunner
with New Orleans beer drinkers after Prohibition. It once claimed
as much as 29 percent of the local market.
   Then came the infamous ``Bad Batch of '75.''
   Over the Fourth of July weekend in 1975, Dixie Beer hit the
stores tasting of phenol. New floors in the brewery's cellars,
where brewing water was stored, emitted the fumes. They ended up in
the water and then in the beer.
   ``Dixie was so much a part of NewOrleans, such a familiar part
of the way of life here, people who bought a bottle or a six-pack
of that batch remember where they were and what they were doing
when they tasted it - the way you remember where you were and what
you were doing on the day John Kennedy was shot,'' said Robert
Oertling, then a Dixie vice president.
   From a yearly output of more than 200,000 barrels, Dixie
plummeted to 60,000. The company came within a hair of joining the
hundreds of small local breweries killed off by competitive wars
with the beer giants.
   Since then, four Dixie presidents have tried everything to
restore the market - knocking on doors, giving away free beer,
lobbying for tax breaks, laying off workers. None of it worked.
   ``The day we bought it, they told us if we didn't, Dixie Beer
would be dead in 15 minutes,'' Ms. Bruno said. ``I guess it was the
challenge that hooked me. I always say I must have been very
optimistic or crazy.''
   She's also a fighter.
   ``I was a very shy person when we bought Dixie,'' she said.
``Now I just stick my hand out and start telling everyone I meet
about this company.''
   Ms. Bruno has done everything from ride the distribution trucks
asking bar owners and markets to carry Dixie Beer to meeting with
business leaders and state officials.
   A state tax exemption given the brewery in 1982 that saved the
company up to $750,000 a year was rescinded after several beer
distributors filed suit, claiming Dixie was getting preferential
treatment.
   In May 1989, Dixie filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
reorganization after the city gave the company 24 hours to come up
with $375,000 in overdue taxes. Dixie owed the state almost $1.6
million in sales, excise and unemployment taxes at the time. It
also owed more than $200,000 in past due water bills.
   ``Since we filed, we've made great progress. Up until now we
were reacting to the problems that were here when we bought the
brewery. Now we have the time to act,'' Ms. Bruno said.
   Since filing Chapter 11, which allows the company to reorganize
its debts while it remains open, Dixie's finances have broken even
several months, Ms. Bruno said.
   The company employs 60 people and produces less than 50,000
barrels of beer a month.
   ``We make beer the old-fashioned way,'' Ms. Bruno said. ``Many
breweries are all automated now. This one still uses people''
   In addition to Dixie, which comes in longnecks, cans and draft,
the company sells Dixie Amber Light in 23 states and 10 countries.
   ``Dixie is more full-flavored than many beers,'' said brewmaster
Guy Hagner. ``Everything in New Orleans is turned up a notch - the
music, the food and the beer. People here like flavor. More people
eat Zip's French bread than Wonder Bread. Dixie is made for people
who want flavor. I think more people have developed their palates
for that today.''
   This fall, the company introduced Blackened Voodoo Lager, an
all-malt beverage that Hagner describes as a flavorful, speciality
beer.
   ``We did two barrels of it and put it in one bar. It went
instantly, less than two days,'' he said.
   A company in England got wind of the new brew and ordered 1,100
cases without even tasting it, Ms. Bruno said.

   Behind the pleas to save the trees and
loggers' cries for saving jobs, millions of dollars are being
wagered on a congressional fight for control of the nation's oldest
forests.
   The timber and paper products industry contributed nearly $5
million to presidential and congressional candidates over the last
eight years, including more than $775,000 to current members of the
Senate and the House from five northwestern states, according to
federal records.
   Environmental groups countered with just over $2 million in the
same period, according to the records.
   ``Today, politics is part of doing business,'' says Ned Massee,
manager of government relations for Westvaco Corp., one of the
country's largest producers of paper products.
   The New York-based owner of 1.1 million acres of U.S.
timberlands led the industry with $716,700 in political action
committee contributions from 1983 through 1990, records at the
Federal Election Commission show.
   Ali Webb of the League of Conservation Voters said, ``We lost
several elections this year because we couldn't help challengers
with sufficient resources.''
   Both sides seem likely to continue pressing their cause as
Congress struggles to decide on the best use for the country's
forests.
   The two sides deny partisan preference in their political
contributions. Yet, 73 percent of the timber money went to
Republicans and 93 percent of the environmental contributions went
to Democrats, according to election commission records.
   Envirnomentalists favor cutbacks in logging to protect the
northern spotted owl and other threatened creatures, to slow
degradation of soils and streams and to enhance wilderness
recreation.
   Industry says such a break from traditional timber practices
would cripple logging communities, cost tens of thousands of jobs
and sharply raise prices for wood products.
   The northern spotted owl has become the most visible symbol of
this struggle, with the Bush administration working to develop a
plan that can save the owl while limiting the loss of jobs in the
lumber industry.
   In a federally mandated effort to protect the threatened owl,
logging is expected to drop in the Pacific Northwest by about 20
percent next year. Environmentalists have enlisted dozens of
legislators in support of even broader forest-protection proposals,
which would cut harvests at least in half.
   This year, President Bush also signed into law toughened
restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs from federal and state
lands. Several members of Congress want a similar ban on exports of
raw logs from private lands as a way of boosting jobs for domestic
processors.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is the industry's favorite recipient
of contributions, with a total of $103,413. Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., is next with $68,980.
   Neither could be reached for comment. Gorton's press secretary,
Kraig Naasz, said the money has not influenced Gorton's voting.
   ``I think our level of contributions from the timber industry is
more reflective of Slade's devotion to timber communities and their
livelihood,'' Naasz said.
   Reps. Jim Clarke, D-N.C., Jim Jontz, D-Ind., and Les AuCoin,
D-Ore., were the financial champions of the environmental
lobbyists. Clarke had contributions of $44,331; Jontz, $31,992;
AuCoin, $31,896.
   AuCoin is one of five legislators who received at least $10,000
from each side. The others are Sens. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., and John
Chafee, R-R.I., and Reps. John Miller, R-Wash., and Richard
Stallings, D-Idaho.
   Since January 1983, industry donations have gone to four in five
of the current members of the Senate and more than two-thirds of
the current members of the House, election commission documents and
Common Cause reports show.
   Aside from Westvaco, other heavy hitters include International
Paper Co., Union Camp Corp., Weyerhaeuser Co., Georgia-Pacific
Corp., Boise Cascade Corp. and the National Forest Products
Association.
   ``When you analyze a company like Boise Cascade and the various
businesses we are in, the impacts that state and federal government
can have on us are immense,'' said Kirk Sullivan, a vice president
for the company in Boise, Idaho. The company owns or controls 6.2
million acres of timberlands and manufactures and distributes paper
and paper products and building materials.
   The Sierra Club tops the contributor list for environmental
groups, spending $1.2 million over the last eight years. The League
of Conservation Voters is next with $701,271.
   Eight other environmental groups registered with the FEC spent a
total of less than $300,000 since January 1983. More than 40 forest
and paper industry PACs are on file.
   Industry contributions have increased steadily in each of the
last four two-year election cycles, from $1 million in 1983-84 to
$1.4 million in the last cycle, the records show.
   Environmentalists spent about $425,000 in 1989-90, according to
the records. Their peak period was $734,143 in 1983-84 - about
one-third of it directed against the re-election of President
Reagan.
   More than 50 senators have received at least $10,000 from the
industry; 20 received more than $30,000. Of the 435 House members,
68 got at least $10,000 from the industry and 18 pulled in more
than $30,000.
   Forty-one senators and four in 10 House members picked up checks
from environmental groups. Ten senators and 18 House members
received more than $10,000.

   Consider the California condor, the Arabian
oryx, the Guam rail, the blue poison dart frog. They are among the
endangered species that have been successfully bred in captivity as
zoologists take the offensive to save many forms of wildlife from
extinction. Such conservation programs have now spread to more than
150 zoos and aquariums.

   No longer mere display cases for nature's
creatures, the nation's zoos and aquariums are taking a more active
role in trying to save species that are rapidly disappearing from
the wild.
   The American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums
headquartered in Bethesda, Md., coordinates a captive-breeding
program for more than 50 endangered species at more than 150 zoos
and aquariums.
   ``It's not the same old zoo anymore. It's not the little guy
with a mustache pushing a broom around,'' says Dick George,
spokesman for the Phoenix Zoo in Arizona. ``We have a
responsibility to face up to in the next decade. It looks like we
are going to be perpetual hosts to these animals.''
   For example, in steamy cinderblock rooms next to the Rain Forest
exhibit at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, curator Jack Cover
heads the breeding of the threatened blue poison dart frog.
   Herpetologists at the aquarium in 1988 became the first to breed
the species. Their success came after they spent five years
carefully re-creating the frog's natural environment, only to find
the tiny creatures prefer the bottom of a plastic 2-liter soda
bottle.
   However, the progeny have never lived up to their name. The
captive-born frogs, whose parents were found in the wild in
isolated pockets of jungle in Suriname, have never produced the
deadly poison researchers want to study.
   Many zoologists fear that they may become curators of living
museum pieces that won't have a home to return to in the wild. One
of the biggest enemies of endangered species has been habitat
destruction, but overhunting, pollution and introduced predators -
those brought by man - have also taken a toll.
   ``When you cut down a rain forest, you're not just cutting down
trees,'' Cover says. ``You're cutting down the environment for
thousands of species.''
   To avoid extinction, an estimated 2,000 species of large
invertebrates will need to be bred in the next two decades, says
Michael Hutchins, director of science and conservation for the zoos
and aquariums association. However, only 900 species can be bred
using current facilities, he says.
   ``Space is extremely limited. Decisions we make now will
probably doom some species to extinction and save others,'' says
Hutchins, who oversees the group's Species Survival Plan. ``The
same kind of decisions will have to be made for wild animas.
   ``Some estimates are that 1 million species of animals and
plants could go extinct in the next two decades. We don't know what
kind of impact that is going to have.''
   Zoos may need to maintain captive populations for as long as 200
years, until world population growth can be controlled and native
habitats restored, some biologists say.
   In addition, zoologists may be forced in the future to move
animals in the wild from place to place to maintain genetic
diversity, and veterinarians may need to make jungle calls to keep
wild populations healthy, Hutchins says.
   ``I tell people that zoos are going to have to change as much in
the next 10 years as they have in the past 100 if they are to
fulfill their role in conservation,'' Hutchins says.
   To be selected for the Species Survival Plan, a species must be
endangered and must be abundant enough in captivity to form a
viable gene pool. Computer records are kept of every animal and its
lineage to prevent inbreeding.
   The aim of the program, which began in 1981, is to create a
self-sustaining captive population for each species. The goal is to
reintroduce the animals to the wild.
   The Phoenix Zoo works with 14 species in the Species Survival
Plan and has successfully reintroduced the Arabian oryx, similar to
an antelope, to the deserts of Oman and Jordan. The Point Defiance
Zoo in Tacoma, Wash., and the Wild Canid Survival Center near St.
Louis have reintroduced red wolves to a North Carolina wildlife
refuge.

   The Philadelphia Zoo has bred the Guam rail, a small tropical
bird that resembles a sandpiper. The Cincinnati Zoo implanted an
embryo from an endangered Indian desert cat into a surrogate mother
- a domestic house cat that nursed the kitten as if it were her
own.
   At the aquarium in Baltimore's redeveloped Inner Harbor, still
one of the most polluted areas of the Chesapeake Bay, a collection
of crickets, wax worms, fruit flies and other insects are kept in
rows of bottles on a shelf in a cramped, pungent work area behind
the rain forest exhibit.
   Above the bottles is a sign reading, ``Time flies like an arrow,
fruit flies like a banana.''
   What blue poison dart frogs like is a diet high in calcium and
phosphorous, humidity and privacy. The three-quarter-inch,
blue-and-black frog is so-named because it secretes a deadly
alkaloid similar to curare, which South American Indians use to
make poison darts.
   ``In the wild they lay their eggs under large jungle leaves,''
Cover says. ``We've found the bottom of 2-liter soda bottles are a
real good breeding hut. We put a plastic leaf in a petri dish and
put the bottle over the top.
   ``The male does a courtship dance. The female, if receptive,
follows him in and does an elaborate courtship dance with all kinds
of stroking and spinning. Then she lays her eggs and he'll
fertilize them.''
   Cover and his colleagues are still working on how to get the
frogs to produce the toxin medical researchers want to study.
Herpetologists and others have tried several unorthodox methods.
   Special diets didn't work, nor did daily handling of the frogs.
They thought cold baths, which would simulate the dangers of the
wild, might be the key.
   ``We actually tested that hypothesis,'' Cover says. ``But in the
wild the frog would already have to have the poison the first time
a predator comes down. There wouldn't be a second chance. So,
danger doesn't seem like it would stimulate production.''
   Perhaps the mostnown endangered species is the California
condor, the largest land bird in North America, which has a
wingspan of up to 10 feet. There are 40 California condors known to
exist and all are in captivity - 21 at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park and 19 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The last condor known to exist in the wild was captured in 1987.
Before 1985, scientists had hoped to breed them in captivity and in
the wild, but between 1984 and 1985, four of the last five breeding
pairs in the wild were lost and presumed dead. In 1985, federal
officials decided to capture all remaining wild condors in a
last-ditch effort to save the species.
   That effort drew criticism from several environmental groups,
but it appears to have been the right choice.
   ``When we first hatched birds in captivity, it was pretty
exciting,'' says Dr. Michael Wallace, curator of birds at the Los
Angeles Zoo. ``We were under a lot of pressure from outside groups
to release the birds. It's good to see we could not only do it, but
do it fairly well.''
   Four of the vulture-like chicks were hatched this year at the
San Diego park and four at the Los Angeles Zoo. That success has
enabled zoologists to consider reintroducing some of the condors
into the wild as early as next year, several years ahead of
schedule.
   Despite their successes, zoologists are quick to remind that
breeding programs are only part of the solution.
   ``Zoos are looking at being part of a holistic program,''
Hutchins says. ``If we are going to save species, we just can't
save them in zoos. But at least having these populations in
captivity provides us with the option of reintroducing them.''

   For a century and a half the great ships of the
Cunard line have been sailing the seas, in war and peace. Today
Cunard has seven cruise ships, including the QE2, calling at 240
ports around the world. A reporter who recently took a cruise on
the Black Sea in Eastern Europe tells of the line's colorful
history.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MS VISTAFJORD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old Sam Cunard would be
delighted to learn that stewards on the steamship line he launched
150 years ago still don immaculate white gloves to serve afternoon
tea, that no cabin numbers end in 13 and that the ship's concert
survives as the passenger talent show.
   He would be particularly gratified to learn that when Her
Majesty calls, Cunard ships still go off to war, as the QE2 did,
with a helicopter pad covering its swimming pool, in the Falkland
Islands war. After all, he was knighted for deploying his entire
eight-ship fleet to transport troops and horses to the Crimean War.
   Sir Samuel wouldn't be too upset at finding Cunard's main
operations are now centered in New York, and not London or
Liverpool. Halifax, Nova Scotia, was his birthplace and home port
when the admiralty awarded him the contract ``to convey the mails
from a point in England to Halifax and back, twice each month.'' He
ordered four steam and sail paddle-wheelers built and began the
service in 1850, with Boston at the aft end of what Cunard captains
still call the Western crossing.
   But how in all thunderation did a Cunard ship wind up with a
name like the Vistafjord? Or the Sagafjord? Or Seagoddess I or II?
   In Sam Cunard's day and for almost 100 years all Cunarders had
names ending in ia: Saxonia, Media, Parthia, Lucania, Campania,
Franconia, Caronia. Nearly 200 of them, all the way from that first
paddle-wheeler, the Britannia, to the elegant four-stackers like
the Aquitania, the Lusitania and the Mauretania.
   Then along came the Queen Mary and that legend of how the litany
ended. Cunard favored the name Victoria for its first
1,000-foot-long superliner. During a grouse shoot at Balmoral
Castle, company director Lord Rydon asked King George V's
permission to name the new flagship for ``the most illustrious and
remarkable woman who has ever been queen of England.'' Not thinking
at all of his grandmother, his majesty replied: ``This is the
greatest compliment ever paid to my wife. I'll ask her as soon as I
get home.''
   A queen's whim altered the name of Cunard's current flagship,
which was to have been called the Queen Elizabeth, like its famous
predecessor. But at the moment of launching, Queen Elizabeth II
impulsively christened her Queen Elizabeth 2, insisting on the
Arabic numeral to avoid any thought that she was naming the ship
after herself.
   The former Norwegian American liners Vistafjord and Sagafjord
ran up Cunard's familiar ensign of a lion rampant after their
purchase in 1983. Most of their officers signed on with the new
owners, so that now Cunard's Fifth Avenue headquarters is staffed
by a number of Norwegian vice presidents and a couple of Swedes.
``What we call the Scandinavian Mafia,'' laughed Capt. Sverre
Brakstad of the Vistafjord who as a boy in Oslo never dreamed of
commanding a Cunarder. ``I thought you had to be born on the Clyde
or in Bristol.''
   Over a century and a half, Cunard's teakwood decks have echoed
to the tread of history and heaved and pitched with the waves of
ever-passing social change.
   In Samuel Cunard's lifetime, his ships reduced from six to two
weeks the time it took a letter to reach New York from London. They
carried the first great waves of Irish and German immigrants and
such illustrious passengers as Charles Dickens, Jenny Lind and Mark
Twain.
   Soon Cunard's trans-Atlantic ships doubled and tripled in size.
The Sophia was the first to boast ``electric illumination
throughout.'' Before the turn of the century, travel posters touted
the line's ``floating cities,'' the 600-foot-long Campania and
Lucania, with funnels ``as high as the Eddystone lighthouse.''
Marconi conducted wireless experiments aboard the Lucania, enabling
the first ship's newspaper to be slipped under cabin doors.
   In the early part of the 20th century, ``British stately homes
went to sea under the names Lusitania, Mauretania and Aquitania,''
as one critic described the luxuriant four-stackers.
   Then suddenly the Cunard saga was written in grim headlines, not
travel brochures: the Carpathia racing to pick up survivors of
competing White Star Line's flagship Titanic. The Lusitania going
to the bottom in 18 minutes with a loss of 1,198 lives, torpedoed
off the Irish coast by U-boat 20 on May 7, l915.
   Cunard lost 20 ships in World War I but won history's only sea
battle between ocean liners when the Carmania engaged the Cap
Trafalgar off the Brazilian coast, capsizing the Hamburg South
American liner after a deadly exchange between gun crews.
   Prohibition ushered in the popular ``booze cruises'' with Jazz
Age swingers such as Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald sailing off to
Havana or Nassau to slake their thirst.

   At John Brown shipyard on Clydeside in Scotland, the Great
Depression halted work for two years on hull No. 534, idling more
than 3,500 workers, but the Queen Mary, the most-beloved of all
Cunard ships, finally made her maiden voyage on May 27, 1936.
   When the ship reporters came aboard from the pilot boat, there
was never a shortage of royalty, real or Hollywood, on the
Cunarders. Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, the Shah of Iran and
the Sultan of Jahore favored the Queen Mary, as did the exiled
Edward VIII and the Duchess of Windsor, who traveled with 75 trunks
in the hold and 70 pieces of luggage in their suite.
   Film queens from Mary Pickford to Elizabeth Taylor climbed up on
the rail, wreathed in a life preserver, for the requisite
cheesecake publicity shot. Gertrude Lawrence was ``in the captain's
doghouse'' for walking her Pomeranian on the boat deck and not the
kennel deck. Liberace, in gold lame jacket, scuttled protocol by
insisting that cabin and tourist-class passengers attend his
concert. Mae West, who got a life jacket named for her prow, was
beloved by the crew for her large tips and the final night party
she threw for waiters and stewards who served her.
   The even-larger Queen Elizabeth, down to two stacks, made her
debut in time to don gray livery and go off to war as a troopship.
Zigzagging and outspeeding submarines, the Queens delivered
millions of British and Commonwealth soldiers to every war zone.
   Transporting whole U.S. divisions for the Normandy invasion -
the Mary once packed 16,683 aboard - the Queens in Winston
Churchill's estimation ``shortened the war in Europe by at least a
year.'' The U-boats never got close, but there was one tragedy when
the Queen Mary in rough seas collided with her escort HMS Curacao,
slicing the cruiser in half. Wartime rules did not permit
endangering her prime cargo of 15,000 soldiers by picking up
survivors.
   The United States paid Cunard $91 million for deploying 1.6
million GIs on the Queens, a bargain rate of $57 per passenger,
considering that teak decks caked with chewing gum (banned too late
in the ships' canteens) had to be replaced, along with miles of
mahogany railings whittled away by initials, unit numbers and
visits from Kilroy.
   Cunard hit its postwar peak in the '50s, carrying one-third of
all trans-Atlantic passengers on 12 liners. But on an October
morning in 1958, bridge officers on the Queen Elizabeth saw the
first commercial jet roar off from New York's Idlewild Airport, as
JFK Airport was then known. Soon the Queens were each losing $1
million a year. When the Queen Elizabeth docked at Hudson River
Pier 90 with 900 crew and less than 200 paying guests, the end of
the line for liners was gloomily predicted.
   ``They're always predicting the end of the line for us,''
laughed Capt. Barkstad, during a cruise in the Black Sea. ``Yet
more people travel by ship today than ever before. Competition has
never been keener. Newer cruise ships holding 2,500 or more are
being launched. The airplane has proved to be our best friend. We
could never operate cruise schedules around the world without it.''
   Cunard has seven cruise ships calling at 240 ports around the
world, and the QE2 still keeps up a semblance of trans-Atlantic
service with 18 crossings a year.
   Contrary to an unsinkable legend, Cunard captains throughout the
line's history have rarely been called on to perform marriages.
   Brakstad, who has been a captain for half of his 56 years, has
yet to tie any marital knots, but he does have a plaque in his sea
cabin that reads: ``All marriages performed by this captain are
valid only for the duration of the voyage.''

   To some, the welfare systems in northern Europe
are the world's most humane. To others, they're a wasteful gravy
train, supporting thousands of people who could work if they had
to. Now, an economic downturn is threatening the generous systems
and some people living off them will feel the pinch.

<HEAD>Welfare State's Future Questioned As Recession Looms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Northern Europe's welfare
states wonder how to keep their cradle-to-grave safety nets from
fraying in the impending recession.
   In the post-World War II boom years, the Scandinavian countries,
the Netherlands and West Germany introduced programs that spend up
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare.
   Welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that
was supposed to pay the bill. With growth slowing in many European
countries, some governments are considering cutbacks.
   With less money available for welfare, government officials
complain more loudly about people abusing the system.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers says his nation's welfare
system, which will cost the government 132.3 billion guilders
($79.6 billion) in 1991, is out of hand.
   In a recent report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, citing Holland's high income taxes and generous
welfare benefits, concluded that incentives to work are low. The
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate.
   Dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless Amsterdam
residents to the understaffed flower industry, even after the
government offered a car for every four workers to use for
commuting, as well as personal use.
   Denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 1.4 million
people - 28 percent of the population - who live on welfare. The
center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private
industry.
   Denmark has 20,000 people under 40 years of age getting
permanent government pensions of 3,709 kroner ($662) a month
because of drug or alcohol problems.
   In Europe, welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless.
The system commonly includes free medical insurance, sick pay,
disability and old age pensions, and child-care and unemployment
benefits.
   In Sweden, parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off
to nurse a sick child.
   ``The basic thing is that everyone should have basic
opportunities to ... take part in all activities within our
society,'' said Annchristen Filipson of the Swedish Social Affairs
Ministry.
   Scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs. Their
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the
industrialized world.
   Last October, Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party made the
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 251.39
billion kronor ($45.13 billion), just over one-fifth of the GNP.
   The government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor ($2.69
billion dollars) from the welfare budget in 1991. The government is
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent
of a worker's salary for the first three days in an effort to
discourage malingering. Workers take an average 25 days of sick
leave a year.
   The welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by
employers and employees, and some are getting fed up.
   Ove Danemar of the Swedish Employers' Federation criticized
``the whole system'' because ``it stimulates people to work less
and to take more leisure time.
   ``The private sector can't bear it any longer,'' he said. ``It's
no longer consistent with a modern economy.''
   Critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but
have ended up being abused. During more favorable economic times,
the abuse was widely tolerated. But with the Continent entering a
recession, there is more clamping down on wasteful spending.
   Lubbers has vowed to curb Holland's Unsuitability for Work Act,
under which nearly 900,000 people get life-long disability pensions
of up to 70 percent of their last-earned pay. In the late 1970s,
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees,
passing the social cost on to the government.
   About one-third of the program's beneficiaries claim
psychological reasons for being unable to work. In a recent speech,
Lubbers said wryly: ``Looking at the statistics ... one has to
admit that ours is a sick nation.''
   This spring, the Dutch government is expected to make deep cuts
in the housing, education and cultural subsidies that complement
the welfare handouts, themselves equal to at least 70 percent of
the minimum wage. It has borrowed heavily and diverted money from
other programs to cover welfare costs.
   Only Germany is making large welfare increases, to pay millions
of former East Germans who are unemployed.
   Norway is slightly expanding its 125.8 billion kroner ($21
billion) welfare system, on which almost a quarter of the
population depends in some form or other. The Labor government has
added about one billion kroner ($166 million) to the bill since
coming into office last month and even the right-leaning opposition
Progress Party favors the expansion.

<HEAD>Higher Taxes Go Into Effect Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New federal taxes will raise the price of
tobacco, beverage alcohol and some luxuries beginning Tuesday while
upper-bracket Americans will have to pay higher income taxes to
help reduce the nation's budget deficit.
   The changes, combined with the 5.1-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax
increase that took effect Dec. 1, will raise the average
household's federal tax bill by about $215 a year. Congress
estimates the average family making less than $50,000 will pay an
extra $1 a week.
   Those with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 will pay about
$278 a year more on the average. The increase for the
$100,000-to-$200,000 group will average $839. The richest 600,000
couples and individuals - with incomes over $200,000 - will pay an
average of $8,598 more per year.
   Congress hit top-income earners to correct what many lawmakers
perceived as overly generous tax cuts during the 1980s. The new law
boosts the top income-tax rate on people at that income level,
restricts their itemized deductions, phases out the value of their
personal exemptions and subjects more of their wages to Medicare
payroll taxes.
   On the other hand, prior law will give all taxpayers bigger
exemptions and other adjustments designed to prevent last year's
inflation from raising their income taxes.
   The new year also brings a major increase in the earned-income
tax credit, which benefits low-income working families with
children, and expanded tax incentives for energy investment.
   Here are highlights of the changes:
   TOBACCO: Taxes are rising by 25 percent, meaning the 16-cent tax
on a pack of cigarettes goes to 20 cents. Other levies: as much as
$30 per 1,000 large cigars; $1.125 per 1,000 small cigars; chewing
tobacco, 12 cents a pound; snuff, 36 cents a pound; pipe tobacco,
67{ cents a pound.
   ALCOHOL: The liquor tax goes up $1 to $13.50 for a gallon of
100-proof (50 percent alcohol), an extra 20 cents a fifth for
100-proof; 16 cents for 80-proof. The beer tax is doubled to 32
cents a six-pack. The tax on wine is rising, depending on alcohol
content. Table wine, now 17 cents a gallon, goes to $1.07; the levy
on artificially carbonated wine, now $2.40, goes to $3.30 a gallon.
   LUXURIES: A new 10 percent tax applies to that portion of the
price above $30,000 for cars, $100,000 for boats, $250,000 for
aircraft and $10,000 for furs and jewelry. Vehicles, including
taxis and cruise ships, used to transport people for hire are
exempt.
   The tax applies only to the first retail sale of an item.
However, Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountants note, for example, that if
stones from an antique bracelet worth $10,000 were reset into a new
piece of jewelry worth $15,000, the tax would be levied against
$5,000.
   TELEPHONE SERVICE: The 3 percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service, which had been scheduled to expire Dec. 31, was
made permanent.
   GAS GUZZLERS: The penalty tax on fuel-thirsty cars is doubled.
Any new car bought in 1991 with an EPA rating under 22{ miles per
gallon is subject to a tax ranging from $1,000 (for a 21{-mpg
model) to $7,700 (less than 12{ mpg).
   TAX RATES: A quirk in the 1986 law that allowed some top-income
people to pay a lower rate on part of their earnings than applied
to those with slightly less income has been eliminated. This
results in a new top rate of 31 percent, down from 33 percent. The
majority of Americans will continue to pay a flat rate of 15
percent on their taxable income.
   Because of the new law and the automatic inflation adjustments,
the new rate structure looks like this:
   -Single people pay 15 percent of the first $20,350 of taxable
income (after exemptions and deductions); 28 percent on the next
$28,950 and 31 percent on everything over $49,300.
   -Couples filing a joint return pay 15 percent of the first
$34,000 of taxable income; 28 percent on the next $48,150 and 31
percent on everything over $82,150.
   EXEMPTIONS: Increased by $100 to $2,150. Once adjusted gross
income (AGI) exceeds $100,000 for a single person or $150,000 for a
couple, the exemptions are reduced gradually. They are eliminated
totally once income tops $222,500 (single) or $272,500 (couple).
   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: Go up from $3,250 to $3,400 for singles and
from $5,450 to $5,700 for couples.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: Couples and individuals with AGI over
$100,000 will be allowed to use only 97 percent of otherwise
allowable itemized deductions. The limit does not apply to medical
expenses, investment interest or deductions for theft or casualty
losses.
   Costs of cosmetic surgery will be allowed as a deductible
medical expense only if the procedure is necessary to correct a
deformity arising from a birth defect, accident or disfiguring
disease. Ego-boosting tummy tucks and facelifts are out; nobody can
yet say for sure whether orthodontic braces will continue to be
deductible.
   SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES: The 10 million workers who earn more than
$51,300 a year will pay a higher Social Security tax. The rate
remains 6.2 percent but will apply to the first $53,400 earned in
1991 - up from the maximum $51,300 in 1990.
   The 1.45 percent tax (generally lumped together on paycheck
stubs with the Social Security tax) that finances Medicare hospital
benefits will apply to the first $125,000 earned in 1991, up from
$51,300 in 1990.
   Workers' Social Security and Medicare taxes are matched by their
employers.
   CAPITAL GAINS: Although higher-income people will pay a tax rate
of 31 percent on some of their income, the top rate applying to
capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock and other
investments, is 28 percent.
   MINIMUM TAX: This 21 percent levy, aimed at ensuring that
higher-income people pay some tax regardless of how many legitimate
deductions they have, goes up to 24 percent.
   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: The maximum credit rises to $1,192 for a
one-child family and $1,235 for a family with two or more children.
There is a new supplemental credit of up to $357 if a child is
under the age of 1, and another credit of up to $428 to help
low-income families buy health insurance.
   ENERGY: New tax incentives of about $500 million a year are
designed to encourage investment in exploration and production of
oil, gas and alternative fuels. These include a 15 percent tax
credit for costs of expensive oil-recovery techniques and drilling
when world oil prices drop.
   ART CONTRIBUTIONS: For 1991 only, a high-income person who is
subject to the minimum tax may donate an artwork to certain
charities and deduct the full market value, rather than just the
cost.

   For three years, the tobacco lobby has worked
hard to influence an Environmental Protection Agency report on the
risks tobacco smoke poses to non-smokers. Using the Freedom of
Information Act, The Associated Press obtained documents that
reveal details of this classic confrontation between science and
big business.

   When the Environmental Protection Agency
convened a panel of scientific experts to rule on whether
second-hand cigarette smoke causes lung cancer in non-smokers, both
sides arrived fully armed.
   Most of the megatonnage belonged to the tobacco industry, which
employed an army of public relations people brandishing bulging
reports ebutting everything ever said about the dangers of passive
smoking.
   Anti-smoking scientists and activists, unable to match the
industry's fire power, relied on carefully timed press releases and
other surgical strikes.
   But this gathering in Arlington on Dec. 4-5 was just the latest,
most visible battle in a war that had gone on quietly in EPA
offices and lawyers' conference rooms for three years.
   Correspondence and memorandums obtained by The Associated Press
under the Freedom of Information Act reveal strenuous efforts by
the tobacco industry to influence the EPA deliberations on
second-hand smoke.
   The stakes were obvious - and enormous.
   ``If second-hand smoke is officially listed as a class A
carcinogen'' - a known cause of human cancer - ``it is the end of
smoking in any public place,'' said Julia Carol of Americans for
Nonsmokers' Rights in Berkeley, Calif.
   ``Certainly this was an important issue to us,'' said Brennan
Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, the industry's
trade group in Washington, D.C. ``What we have tried to do is stay
in the process.''
   The industry has proven adept at that. It has not only been with
the process, but ahead of it.
   In October 1987, industry lawyers met with Robert Axelrad,
director of the EPA's indoor air division, before the EPA's study
of passive smoke and cancer had even begun.
   ``They were correctly guessing we might get into tobacco
smoke,'' said Axelrad. ``It was a `get acquainted.'''
   In a March 18, 1988, letter to the EPA, Samuel Chilcote,
president of the Tobacco Institute, laid out the industry's
position: The evidence doesn't show tobacco smoke causes lung
cancer in non-smokers.
   Two years earlier, both the U.S. surgeon general and the
National Research Council had concluded that passive smoking does
cause lung cancer. The tobacco industry didn't accept the
conclusions of either report.
   Chilcote went so far as to suggest the phrasing the EPA ought to
use. He warned against the terms ``passive smoking'' and
``involuntary smoking.''
   They ``could cause confusion and lead to a mistaken view that
exposure to ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) is in fact
`involuntary smoking,''' Chilcote wrote. ``These terms should
simply be avoided.''
   The industry also argued that ventilation - not restriction of
smoking - is the best way to clear the air.
   The EPA's position is that all indoor air pollutants, including
cigarette smoke, are best removed by elimination of the source, not
by ventilation.
   The EPA said so in letters to the Tobacco Institute and its
lawyers. The industry repeated its assertions again and again for
two years.
   By June 1989, William Rosenberg, the EPA's assistant
administrator for air and radiation, had had enough. In a letter to
a tobacco industry lawyer, he criticized the industry's insistence
that the evidence linking passive smoking to cancer is
``controversial.''
   ``The fact of the matter is, we find the Surgeon General and the
National Research Council reports to be highly credible,''
Rosenberg wrote.
   ``Frankly, the tobacco industry's argument ... would be more
credible if it were not so similar to the tobacco industry's
position on direct smoking, despite the estimated 50,000 studies
linking smoking with disease in humans.''
   The tempo of the exchange between the EPA and the industry
picked up last June. A draft copy of the EPA report was leaked and
then officially released to the press; unflinchingly, it concluded
that second-hand smoke is a known cause of lung cancer.
   The industry stepped up its lobbying. When the EPA appointed the
panel of scientific experts that would meet in Arlington, the
industry worked ard for the dismissal of Dr. David Burns, the
senior editor of the surgeon general's report on passive smoking.
   The effort succeeded, but not for long. When word of his
dismissal got out, Burns was reappointed.
   U.S. Rep. Thomas Bliley of Richmond, Va. - where Philip Morris
is the largest private employer - took up the industry cause.
   He wrote to the EPA to say that the reappointment of Burns
raises ``serious questions about the overall integrity of the
selection process.''
   The charge was that Burns was an activist, and therefore
couldn't be impartial. Burns denied the charge, and many other
scientists said he was one of the nation's leading authorities on
the subject of passive smoking.
   Subsequent news reports revealed that six of the 16 scientists
on the panel had ties to a tobacco industry research organization.
One of the six was also negotiating for a $1.2 million research
grant from Philip Morris while serving on the EPA panel. A seventh
was recommended by the tobacco industry.
   The loudest outcry over those revelations didn't come from
anti-smoking activists. It came from Bliley, the industry ally.
   The selection process ``has become so deeply enmeshed in
political and media controversy that an objective review by the
present panel is no longer possible,'' he wrote on Nov. 23. He
urged the EPA to select a new expert panel - a move that would have
delayed completion of the final EPA report.
   The entire process has drawn criticism from all sides. ``It's
not the first time the industry has tried to influence science,''
said Dr. Alan Blum, the founder of Doctors Ought to Care, an
anti-smoking group.
   He said he was puzzled by the public's apparent lack of concern.
``If the toxic waste people tried to do something like this, they
would be blasted by everyone in the country. When the tobacco
industry does it, we look at it as business as usual.''
   Dawson of the Tobacco Institute blamed the disruption of the
scientific process on anti-smoking advocates. ``There has been a
lot of involvement by the anti-smoking community that we don't
think should be there,'' she said. ``If you're going to pursue
science, it ought to be without advocacy.''
   ``We don't have lobbyists everywhere,'' protested Carol, at
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. ``We have not felt that it was
our business to tell the EPA what the science is.''

   Not long after a good friend died fighting
members of a rival gang, the nightmares began for Nightowl.
   The gang member, who says he fears police reprisal if he gives
his real name, dreams that he is bound hand and foot. The man who
killed his friend Chopper six months ago points a gun at him and
fires.
   ``I can see him and I'm scared and I'm full of hate,'' Nightowl
says. ``Then I wake up and I think, `I can't go down to the
neighborhood because if I do, I'm going to die.' But you know, I go
down anyway.''
   Nightowl, his street name, is dressed in typical gang fashion:
white T-shirt and oversized pants. His hair is close-cropped except
at the nape of the neck, where it is tied in a small ponytail.
   The 19-year-old is a member of the Clarence Street Locos. Three
Locos have been killed so far this year in the gang's war with the
rival East LA Dukes. And the Locos say there's no truce in sight.
   ``It's never going to stop. Too many have died already,'' said a
member of The Mafia Connection, an ally of the Locos.
   Bloody warfare among black and Hispanic street gangs has made
1990 a record year for gang-related homicides in the nation's
second-largest city.
   Gang killings are up a staggering 53 percent in suburban areas
patrolled by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. The gang death
count was at 160 as of Nov. 30, compared to 104 during the same
period in 1989 and 116 gang murders for all of 1989.
   In the city of Los Angeles, there was a 12.4 percent jump in
gang killings as of Nov. 30, with 315 dead. In 1989, 276 people
were killed in gang-related incidents during that period, with a
total of 303 gang homicides committed for all of 1989.
   Cmdr. William Booth said the numbers are deceptive because
police today can better identify gang members, and investigators
are more likely to call a murder gang-related than they were in the
past. Even so, gang violence is increasing, he said.
   ``They have the weapons and they have the mobility. Plus, they
simply have little reverence for human life, somebody else's
life,'' Booth said. ``It's almost an animal kind of syndrome that
prevails with the gang mentality.''
   The stories behind the statistics illustrate the heartbreak and
terror of gang violence:
   - A 5-year-old South Los Angeles girl was killed by a stray
bullet as she joined friends to sing ``Happy Birthday'' at a party.
   - In eastern Los Angeles County, Albert Domingo Simenia, 36, was
fatally stabbed while battling eight gang members in his front
yard.
   - In suburban La Puente, worried school officials canceled a
high school football game following 16 gang-related shootings in
two weeks.
   - Fourteen people, including two toddlers, were wounded in a
Nov. 30 drive-by attack during a family party in Valinda.
   The carnage has overshadowed the success of an anti-gang pilot
program in a South Los Angeles area controlled by the Crips and
Bloods, two predominantly black gangs.
   ``The violence is not even personal,'' said the Rev. Gregory
Boyle, a Roman Catholic priest who has buried 10 gang members this
year from his East Los Angeles parish. ``The war we're having right
now, there are even brothers, flesh and blood brothers, on
different sides.''
   Police most often blame the increased violence on easy-to-get
weapons and the release of hundreds of older Latino gang members
imprisoned since the mid-1980s.
   Youth workers, however, say an influx of Central American
immigrants has changed the nature of Hispanic gangs. Traditional
neighborhood gangs that fought over neighborhood boundaries are
giving way to more pragmatic groups trafficking in drugs and
prostitution, said Steve Valdivia, director of Community Youth Gang
Services.
   ``In the Latino community, the warriors have changed, but the
war goes on,'' Valdivia said.
   ``It has a direct correlation with the political and economic
upheaval in other countries. A lot of them come over with a violent
history. The law enforcement here is no match for what they saw
over there. Over there the police cut off an arm or slit your
throat. Here, they put you in jail and feed you well,'' he said.
   But others argue that police have been too heavy-handed in
dealing with gangs. As the violence increases, so has the criticism
of the rough shakedowns and neighborhood sweeps that have been law
enforcement's primary tool.
   Police themselves are saying that social programs are needed to
turn youths away from gangs.
   ``We're arresting more people, we're prosecuting more people,''
said Sheriff Sherman Block. ``The problem is the law enforcement
workload continues to grow because of failures in other
institutions. We're talking about school dropout rates, alternative
programs that will offer the same kind of need satisfaction that
the gangs offer.''
   Of the estimated 100,000 gang members in Los Angeles County, 5
percent to 8 percent are ``hope-to-die killer-criminals'' who
should be in jail, Valdivia said. The rest, he said, probably can
be turned away from gangs if they realize there is an alternative.
   ``The same things work in any community. Those are prevention,
mobilization, community action and law enforcement. Opportunity is
a nice thing to throw in also,'' he said. ``You'd be surprised how
people behave when you treat them as human beings.''
   Valdivia said a one-two punch of tough law enforcement and
social programs reduced violence in two South Los Angeles
neighborhoods which, until last year, had been the nation's worst
for gang violence.
   While police confronted gang members in the streets, Youth Gang
Services organized basketball and softball leagues and offered
classes to teach young people how to prepare for job interviews.
Part-time jobs were offered through the Department of Public Works.
   As a result, the Southeast Precinct reported just 17
gang-related homicides during the first eight months of 1990,
compared to 39 the previous year. In the 77th Precinct,
gang-related killings dropped from 42 to 27, according to police
statistics.
   ``Folks will tell you there's a different feeling,'' said
Charles Norman, Youth Services director in the Southeast Precinct.
``If we can do this, the negative element is just going to move
on.''
   Norman said some youths joined gangs to avoid becoming their
prey.
   ``Take away the jungle atmosphere, most kids won't join a gang.
They don't need it,'' he said.
   But for those already in a gang, loyalties run deep. Nightowl
said police crackdowns just make them deeper.
   He said authorities would stand a better chance of staunching
the bloodshed by providing educational opportunities and jobs.
   Like most of the Locos, Nightowl is a high school dropout.
Steady jobs are hard to find.
   The teen-ager, whose father also was a gang member, soon will
become a father himself. The cycle, he said, is tough to break.
   ``You know, what scares me most is the thought that my little
kid is going to grow up and be a gang member,'' he said. ``It
scares the hell out of me. But, you know, what can you do about
it?''

   In a neighborhood numbed by murderous gang
warfare, the Rev. Gregory Boyle battles the violence with what he
considers the voice of reason and the love of God.
   Since arriving at the Dolores Mission five years ago, Boyle has
persuaded mothers to take guns away from their gang-member sons and
coaxed dozens of gang members to attend the mission's alternative
high school.
   But in gaining the trust of young gangsters, Boyle has roused
the suspicion of police, who say his open-arms approach gives the
gangs legitimacy they don't deserve.
   Boyle, in turn, has become a sharp critic of anti-gang
strategies that rely on force and intimidation.
   ``The image for me always is symptom vs. problem,'' said Boyle.
``The police don't have a clue to what the problem is, so what hope
do we have that they will be part of the solution? The problem is
dysfunctional families and poverty and boredom and jobs. You
address that and the gang mess will dry up.''
   A Los Angeles native, Boyle, 36, was ordained to the Jesuit
order in 1984 after graduating from the Weston School of Theology
in Boston. He spent the next year working in an impoverished
village in the Bolivian highlands, where he was converted to
religious activism.
   When Boyle arrived at Dolores, he began searching for a solution
to the bloody warfare waged by 11 gangs that operate in the parish.
Soon he decided he could accomplish more by working with the gangs
instead of against them.
   It is a strategy police dislike. Capt. Bob Medina, commander of
the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollenbeck Division, said Boyle
has undermined police efforts to convince young people that gang
membership in itself is bad.
   ``He permits them to congregate over there, to wear their
colors. I think that's contrary to what we're trying to do,''
Medina said. ``We're trying to dissuade youngsters from joining
gangs. The actions he has taken gives them some credibility and
makes them proud to be in gangs.''
   Boyle turned Dolores Mission, a parish church and school about
two miles east of downtown Los Angeles, into a sort of no-man's
land where gang members are welcome to congregate provided they
leave weapons, drugs and liquor outside.
   Boyle acknowleded his strategy hasn't stopped the killing. So
far this year, he has buried 10 gang members and attended services
for even more.
   But he points out that more than a decade of aggressive police
crackdowns has failed to stem a steady increase in violence.
   During 1990, gang killings have increased more than 30 percent
in the Hollenbeck Division, which includes Boyle's parish,
according to police statistics. Overall gang-related violence in
the area is up more than 50 percent.
   Boyle blames the carnage on poverty and despair. In his parish,
a mostly Hispanic area of public housing projects and aging
wood-frame houses, jobs are scarce and teens frequently drop out of
high school long before graduation.
   ``It's all despair, so threats of any kind, all those things
that would work in someone who cared, it doesn't cut it for kids
who don't have a sense of hope for a better future,'' Boyle said.
   Earlier this year, Medina asked Boyle's superiors in San
Francisco to transfer the priest out of East Los Angeles. Church
officials declined, Medina said. Since then, Archbishop Roger
Mahony in Los Angeles has reaffirmed his support for Boyle's
campaign.
   Boyle said that so far, he has been unable to achieve one of his
major goals - to arrange a lasting cease-fire among warring gangs.
But at times, his approach pays off.
   Last summer, Boyle found temporary jobs for about 40 gang
members. So long as they were working, they refrained from
``gang-bangings,'' or launching attacks on rival bands, he said.
   Several gang members interviewed in the mission's small
recreation room said there was less temptation to fight when they
were employed.
   ``When you get a job you change because you're making money. You
can go places. You don't have to stay around here,'' said one gang
member who refused to give his name. ``You don't have to steal, you
don't have to sell dope. ... You got a job, it does change a lot of
people.''
   Boyle said he believes his approach - despising the sin but not
the sinner - will work in the long run. But that is not why he
employs it.
   ``The stand this church has to gang members is what Jesus would
do, that it's morally correct and based on the gospel,'' he said.
``To work with them and find jobs for them and lovingly accept them
is what Jesus would do. Whether any of that works is not my
concern. I think it works, but that's not the point.''

   Babies sell. Like pretty girls, they are used to
peddle everything from suntan oil to automobile tires in TV
commercials. But capturing those few seconds of charm can be a
nightmare for the directors and cameramen. Here's a peep behind the
scenes at a shooting.

   The meter is running, clicking off thousands of
dollars an hour in expenses.
   Camera crews and lighting technicians dawdle; the stand-ins, the
mothers, the baby handler, the attending nurse are transfixed. The
advertising man paces. The director's anxious eyes flit from his
watch to the non-developing scenario before him.
   Center stage is the star. A baby.
   ``They are probably the most difficult commercials I've ever
shot,'' says Mike Rogers, senior vice president to the creative
director for DDB-Needham. He handles tire commercials.
   Nonetheless, babies are great for the advertising business. No
one can say how many commercials babies make, or what percentage of
the business infants command, but they sell.
   From the time the puppy tried to pull a tyke's bathing suit down
in the ads for suntan oil to today's tiny tots with adult voices
talking about fast-food restaurants, they are a sure vehicle for
merchandising.
   John Hicks has a company called Baby Wranglers that casts
babies. ``Maybe it's just the innocence,'' he says. ``There's a
vulnerability and there's an exuberance. I don't want to get too
philosophical about it, but I do think we're living in a pretty
jaded world and when we see something like that, it attracts you.''
   It may attract the viewer, but it is a major headache for the
adults who do the filming.
   ``You're helpless,'' Rogers says. ``You go through a lot of
nail-biting and hair-pulling because there is absolutely nothing
you can do. You can do everything possible to create an environment
and cast the right baby. But if that baby isn't feeling well or is
a little bit cranky, you're out of luck.''
   Never mind that there are seven stand-in babies waiting in the
wings.
   A baby might be cast in the morning and is fine in the morning.
But when it comes to shooting the scene, it is afternoon, and maybe
that baby is not an afternoon baby.
   ``You have a baby you want to use, and he'll come to the set
that morning with a rash,'' Rogers frets. ``Or at some point in a
production schedule, you'll say bring that baby in and you'll find
out all of a sudden she has a cut lip because she was playing with
a toy.''
   One commercial for Michelin tires started with a hand drawn
pinup of a big-eared baby in a tire and a line: ``So much is riding
on your tires.'' The campaign has been running six years now (much
longer than normal), gone through some 40 babies, and still garners
awards at the same rate as it did the first year (more than 30 in
all).
   There's great money in it for the babies, too, if they hit, get
on air, last a while. Otherwise, they make the Screen Actors Guild
minimum of about $265 a day, which barely pays for the gas and the
wear-and-tear on mother.
   If the commercial goes through the cycle, then the baby stands
to make $6,000 to $10,000.
   There are instances of babies making much more. Kathy Jennings,
Hicks' partner, cites the case of a baby who worked maybe five
minutes and made $40,000.
   Then there was another case of a baby who was chosen to be the
spokesbaby for a certain product. The baby was put on a retainer.
   ``Nobody took into consideration that babies change both
physically and temperamentally,'' Jennings says. ``So by the time
they went to film a second commercial, not only didn't the baby
look the same, the baby wasn't temperamentally suited.'' They tried
a second baby and then dumped the commercial.
   But the first baby worked two days and made $60,000.
   Hicks is a whirlwind of action during the casting call, what
actors call the cattle call, running out of the audition room to
give a baby back to mother, running back with another, putting the
baby on the mat with a bunch of toys, playing peekaboo, making
strange noises, blowing bubbles.

   He may seem quite mad, but he is carefully assessing this baby,
measuring attention span, independence, good humor, energy level.
He will see 150 babies a day, cut the lot to some 30. Three will
eventually be chosen, the star and two stand-ins.
   He meets one mother in the waiting room. She hands the baby over
to him and the baby cries. He hands the baby back, says the baby is
lovely, but a little nervous today. The mother cries.
   ``She knows it's over and she wanted another try,'' Hicks says.
``I was trying to be real nice, and you have to try to explain that
if I brought the baby into the audition room, I'd only be appeasing
them. I know they have unrealistic expectations. They drove a long
way and I feel bad for them.''
   ``One of the toughest things we have to do is to hand a baby
over to an actor or an actress,'' Hicks adds. ``In an audition, all
I have to do is get a baby to perform and they can do some pretty
amazing things. But when I have to hand that baby to an actor or an
actress, I've lost control and it's unnerving.''
   An actor may be able to fool the creative execs, but he can't
fool the baby. ``The baby can tell by the touch. It's instinctual
and the kid will scream. It's the best alarm system for bad acting
you'll ever find.''
   Hicks remembers one commercial involving three babies in
costume, one of whom kept falling asleep. Then someone got the
bright idea of putting a pair of sunglasses on the dozing child and
it actually added to the commercial's charm.
   ``One of the toughest commercials we did was with a tire covered
with a blanket,'' Rogers says.
   They wanted a baby to walk up to the covered tire, stand there a
couple of seconds, and then whip off the blanket. And they wanted
to shoot it in one take. ``When you want a baby to do something
that's what they won't do,'' Rogers says. ``We couldn't get a baby
to do it. They'd walk in, take a few steps, then crawl, and crawl
right past the tire.''
   Finally, on one of the last shots of the day, one of the babies
did it perfectly.
   One commercial will linger in Mike Rogers' memory forever.
   The commercial was to feature a baby in a tire and a dog sitting
next to him. The dog was to get up, walk offstage and return with a
puppy held by the scruff of his neck. The dog would deposit the
puppy in the tire next to the baby.
   But the crew worried over the safety of the baby. ``You can't
control the little puppy, and we were all concerned it would bite
the baby,'' Rogers says.
   So they put up a partition, which the camera could not see,
between the baby and the puppy. The dog dutifully dropped the puppy
into its compartment in the tire. Then, Rogers says, the
unexpected:
   ``The baby reached over, picked it up and started to bite the
puppy.''

   ``Recycler'' (Warner Bros.) - ZZ Top
   
   Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard still are mining the
old boogie rock to which they first staked their claim to stardom
more than 10 years ago.
   And it still works. The style wears as well as a pair of boots
that never seem too tired for another stomp around the dance floor.
   The Texas trio owe their durability partly to their choice of
classic, time-tested rhythms, but just as much to their ability to
keep their locomotive-like sound fully stoked and running at full
tilt.
   There are no surprises on ``Recycler,'' just another heaping
helping of what ZZ Top fans have come to expect from the biggest
little band in Texas.

   ``Ragged Glory'' (Reprise) - Neil Young and Crazy Horse
   
   Neil Young continues to change musical personae more often than
most guitarists change strings.
   Young's 25-album catalog includes country, rockabilly, synth-pop
and some of the most beautiful ballads of his generation. But
``Ragged Glory,'' as the title would suggest, is an hour of rock
'n' roll as only Young can play it.
   Paired with Crazy Horse, a three-piece band that has
intermittently backed him since 1969, Young delivers a raw,
scorching set dominated by guitar solos.
   He draws from an immense vocabulary of riffs built up over two
decades. The fretboard workout includes crunching chords, ringing
melodies, bent notes and feedback. Occasionally, the energy flags
when a break runs a little long - four of the 10 songs clock in at
more than seven minutes. But Young's playing never sounds
methodical.
   The garage-band sound is matched with lyrics that have this
child of the '60s sounding nostalgic. ``There's a mansion on the
hill,'' Young sings. ``Psychedelic music fills the air. Peace and
love live there still. There's a mansion on the hill.''
   Even when waxing sentimental, Young sings with the energy of a
teen-ager. His casual relationship with the proper key is
Dylanesque, and he doesn't think twice about roaming an octave
above his range.
   ``Ragged Glory'' is a stark contrast to Young's marvelous 1989
album, ``Freedom,'' which contains angry, more polished music. But
if you need a guitar fix, this Neil's for you.

<TEXT>
   From Tarzan's mate to Gerard Depardieu's
leading lady - that's the amazing range of Andie MacDowell's
fast-rising movie career.
   The South Carolinian made her film debut in 1984 opposite
Christopher Lambert in ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of
the Jungle.'' The movie didn't do much for either performer, and
MacDowell's career languished until last year's ``sex, lies and
videotape.'' The film brought prestigious offers, including one
from Peter Weir (``Witness,'' ``Dead Poets Society'') to co-star
opposite Depardieu in ``Green Card.''
   Touchstone Pictures released ``Green Card'' in limited
engagements before year's end in time for Academy Award
consideration, and the movie will open nationally Jan. 11.
   Weir wrote, directed and produced the story of a Frenchman
(Depardieu) who lacks a green card to take a job in the United
States. The solution: get married to an American. MacDowell needs
to be married in order to rent the ``perfect apartment'' in New
York. Voila!
   MacDowell, a rare beauty whose screen presence belies a basic
shyness, admits she was scared to death at her first meeting with
Weir. ``I wanted to do this film so badly, and I wanted to make the
proper impression. Any time you want to make the proper impression,
you usually don't,'' she said with a laugh.
   ``I left that meeting going over every word that I had uttered,
every movement that I had made. I guess it worked. I got the job.''
   Her first meeting with Depardieu was easier: ``Gerard said in an
interview that I was nervous, and I was. I was more nervous meeting
with Peter than with Gerard. He's very charming, you know, and you
can see immediately how easy and comfortable he is with himself.''
   About the language problem: ``I can get by in French. I would
say that Gerard speaks better English than I speak French. We did
all right. A lot of times he would speak French to me, because I
can understand it. Peter speaks perfect French.''
   Andie MacDowell was born in the small mill town of Gaffney,
S.C., and grew up on both sides of the border between the
Carolinas. The urge to act came early.
   ``Even as a child I loved to entertain. I loved to make people
laugh. I used to put on shows in my garage. I danced in front of
the TV - `Look at me! Look at me!' A little bit of a ham, I guess.
I did theater when I was in college,'' she said.
   ``My mother, who is no longer alive, was very happy that I
wanted to act, and she gave me great confidence. She sustained me.
My father, I think at the beginning was a bit frightened, only
because of the possibility of danger that I was going to the big
city. He had plans for his daughter: he wanted me to be a nurse,
get my education, marry a doctor and have children. Now he seems
very proud that I'm happy.''
   MacDowell did go to the big city, where she studied in a
repertory theater. Playing Jane to Lambert's Tarzan seemed like a
star-making turn, but it wasn't. Her only memorable role afterward
was an unobtainable love in the yuppie melodrama ``St. Elmo's
Fire.'' Then came ``sex, lies and videotape,'' in which she played
the frustrated wife of a philandering husband.
   ``I would say it was the beginning of my career,'' she
commented. ``I didn't know how it would turn out. It was such a
low-budget film with a new director (Stephen Soderbergh). When I
met him, I had complete trust in him.
   ``But you just don't know. It might get made and never
distributed. That was my fear. I thought I would have something on
tape to show casting directors what I was capable of. I knew that I
finally had a role that I could do very well.
   ``I had confidence in myself as far as the role. I didn't think
that anybody knew her as well as I knew her. It touched me in a
very deep place.''
   She feared that people might be narrow-minded about the film's
explicit talk. Not until ``sex, lies'' won first prize at the Park
City film festival did she think that it might be distributed after
all. Then it won big at Cannes, and she thought, ``Well, it really
will get distributed!''
   MacDowell lives with her husband, Paul Qualley, and their two
children in a farmhouse outside New York City. ``I wanted to move
further into the country and live on a farm,'' she said, ``but this
career has sort of taken over my life. This year I lived in
Budapest and Rome and London and New York. I did three films.
   ``I don't think I plan to do three films next year. After so
many years of wanting to do good work, to all of a sudden have the
opportunity to work on three such interesting and different
projects, it was too tempting to pass up. I hope I don't do that
again.''

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lone Star Brewery folks surely never
would have imagined it.
   Their beer factory, the biggest in Texas when it opened more
than a century ago, is a cozy museum these days, commanding the
attention of art experts worldwide.
   Just a decade old, the San Antonio Museum of Art is creating a
noticeable niche for itself with a collection of Greek and Roman
antiquities, a burgeoning Egyptian art display and a big Mexican
visiting art show.
   ``We've received very high praise from our colleagues, both here
and abroad,'' said Gerry Scott, the museum's ancient art curator.
``People came through and said, `My goodness, look what you have
here in San Antonio.'''
   The current cheers are for the museum's Ewing Halsell Wing for
ancient art, unveiled in November with much fanfare and a symposium
by appreciative experts.
   Among those attending were former San Antonio antiquities
curator, Carlos Picon, now with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York; Cornelius Vermeule of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston;
Marion True of the J. Paul Getty Museum in California; and Dietrich
Wildung, director of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin.
   The new wing features the Arnold and Marie Smith Schwartz
Gallery for ancient glass, the Estelle Blackburn Gallery of Greek
and Roman decorative arts and the Gilbert Denman Gallery for
ancient sculpture.
   Though some pieces are on loan, most come from an extensive 1986
donation by Denman and the museum's acquisition of the
Stark-Willson antiquities collection.
   A highlight of the antiquities collection is an eight-foot
marble sculpture of the Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus
Aurelius dating to 140 A.D. Excavated in 1771, it reveals the trend
of that time - replacing pieces missing from the original.
   The ``Sleeping Ariadne,'' a Roman sculpture copying a Greek
original dating from the 2nd century A.D., once was in a private
collection in England. Its history is traceable to the 1600s.
   The Roman ``Deer Hunter'' sarcophagus, a marble case for burying
the dead, dates from the 2nd century and features intricate
carvings.
   A sculpture not on display also has generated news.
   Connoisseur magazine reported this fall that a Roman sculpture
of a woman was smuggled out of Turkey, along with a handful of
other art objects, and allegedly ended up at the San Antonio Museum
of Art.
   Museum officials contend the article was ``sensational'' and
insist no evidence has been found that the museum's 8-foot statue
was illegally brought into the country.
   The museum is cooperating with the U.S. Customs Service and the
U.S. attorney's office in an investigation, Scott said. The statue,
lent by an anonymous donor, was noticeably absent when the
antiquities exhibit opened.
   ``We didn't want to have a situation where people were coming in
simply to see that sculpture and missing the other 96 pieces,''
Scott said.
   He added that its size would have made it more difficult to
remove and return to the owner and said its period in art history
already was represented in the exhibit.
   The Denman Gallery pieces range from the 6th century B.C. to the
3rd century A.D., while the Blackburn Gallery's pottery and vases
demonstrate the development of decorative arts in the Classical
Period from 2000 B.C. to 300 B.C.
   The Schwartz Gallery, described as one of the top six nationwide
devoted to ancient glass, shows the development of glass from early
stages in the Near East through later Roman and Islamic periods.
   While the antiquities collection has been praised for its range,
the museum isn't claiming to rival the ``encyclopedic collections''
of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts or New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
   ``Boston and the Metropolitan both opened their doors in 1870,
so they had plenty of years of collecting on us,'' Scott said,
adding that the advantage of the San Antonio collection is its
``human scale.''
   The antiquities collection isn't all that's publicizing the
museum, which previously was best known for its folk art
collection.
   It is one of three nationwide playing host to ``Mexico:
Splendors of Thirty Centuries.'' The exhibit will be here four
months between stops in New York and Los Angeles and will be
greeted in San Antonio by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari the week of its April 4 opening.
   The exhibit will occupy 25,000 square feet, and construction
workers are busy renovating another building of the old brewery to
accommodate it. Two galleries of Egyptian art adjoining the new
Halsell Wing also will close temporarily to make room for the
Mexican show.
   Scott said the museum's antiquities collection is what attracted
him to San Antonio this year after earning his doctorate at Yale
University, working in two Yale art museums and working at a
development company on grant writing.
   As an Egyptologist, Scott said, he was thrilled with the
challenge of helping to build an Egyptian art collection.
   ``I believe that the museum itself, while it's made tremendous
progress in the last 10 years, is poised to make some tremendous
leaps forward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Arlo Guthrie Keeps Music, Humor Flowing</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The secret is out and remember that you heard it
here first: Arlo Guthrie never really wanted to be a folk singer.
   Forget for a moment that he's the son of Woody Guthrie, who
wrote more than 1,000 songs, or that he's written a sizable number
of memorable tunes himself. Forget all those great interpretations
of ``Goodnight Irene,'' ``Amazing Grace,'' ``Stealin''' and ``This
Land Is Your Land'' that you've heard him do over the years. Don't
even think about ``Alice's Restaurant,'' that epic tale of youthful
rebellion and anti-war protest.
   What Arlo Guthrie really wanted to be was a newspaper reporter.
   ``Yeah, there must be a repressed reporter in one of my hidden
personalities because I love to write,'' laughs Guthrie, whose
musical career has seen him evolve from the '60s-kid protest singer
with a sense of humor to one of the pre-eminent voices in American
folk music.
   But he says, ``I didn't become a folk singer because I wanted to
be. I ended up doing this because I didn't know how to do anything
else.
   ``And that hasn't changed much,'' he adds with that quick,
good-natured laugh that his fans have heard so often over the
years. It's the one that sometimes surfaces right on stage, in the
middle of a song, when something strikes him so funny that he has
to stop and tell everyone about it.
   But now the funny stories, the wry asides, the general
observations on the oddities of life are as apt to go down on paper
as over a microphone in a concert hall.
   The ones that are written go into Guthrie's newsletter, The
Rolling Blunder Review, an espistle written in a style that evokes
rollicking images of the kind of old-time journalism chronicled in
such movies as ``The Front Page.''
   But the newsletter never started out to be a newsletter.
   ``It sort of came about by accident,'' Guthrie says.
   In the mid-'70s he began collecting addresses of people who
might want a schedule of his shows, but he never really got around
to sending them one.
   ``People started asking us, `When are you going to send us
something?' They'd say, `I signed up 14 times and I never got
anything,''' he recalled.
   So with a great sense of guilt, The Rolling Blunder Review was
born. Guthrie and his wife, Jackie, typed it on a single sheet of
paper, made copies and mailed it from their home in Washington,
Mass. Early issues contained only the long-sought schedule and a
few funny comments on ``Alice's Restaurant'' and other songs.
   But as word spread, the newsletter grew. Five years later, it's
an eight-page quarterly, containing stories, letters to the editor
and information on how to buy Guthrie's albums, T-shirts and other
merchandise. There's even a cooking column by Alice Brock. (``You
remember Alice. There's a song about Alice.'')
   Some 60,000 to 70,000 people pay $3 a year for it, although it
goes free to people in hospitals and prisons.
   Among the stories in recent issues are reports on concerts to
benefit the environment and in support of student protests in China
and elsewhere. But somehow, almost everything, no matter how
serious, comes out funny. Sort of like an Arlo Guthrie concert.
   He notes that one role of a folk singer is to comment on
political events of the day as his father, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez
and so many others have done.
   ``But it's not the only job, and it may not even be the most
important job,'' he said. ``The most important thing, for me
personally, is maintaining a sense of humor in an often-humorless
world.''
   For Guthrie, the laughs have been frequent. Only he, for
example, could show us (in ``Alice's Restaurant'') how to use a
litterbug arrest as a reason to stay out of the Army during the
Vietnam War. Only he has dared speculate (in ``The Pause of Mr
Claus'') that Santa Claus might enter houses late at night because
he's a dope fiend. Or that a delightful folk ditty about the joys
of tilling the Earth (``The Garden Song'') should be played
backward in search of evil messages.
   The laughs have been so frequent that they've allowed some to
overlook the musical talent. Guthrie is more than proficient on
guitar, piano, harmonica and banjo, as well as a singer of some
range and a writer whose best songs evoke strong images of joy and
sometimes sorrow.
   ``Alice's Restaurant'' started it all in 1967, making him an
overnight star at age 20.
   ``Who could have ever imagined it,'' he says of the way the
youth culture embraced his 18-minute, guitar-accompanied monologue
on how he used a Thanksgiving Day arrest to stay out of the Army.
The song also helped him escape early comparisons with a legendary
father.
   And although Guthrie has almost always included a Woody Guthrie
song or two in his concert repertoire, he downplays the father-son
connection.
   ``For whatever cosmic reasons - and who really understands those
things - I ended up similar to my dad in some ways,'' he says.
``But we're vastly different in other ways.''
   But the connection also brings up another inevitable question.
Woody Guthrie died in 1967 of the debilitating neurological
disorder Huntington's Chorea. It has a 50-50 chance of being passed
from parent to child, it strikes in middle age, and Arlo Guthrie is
43.
   But he dismisses such inquiries good-naturedly. ``I'm not dead
yet,'' he says. ``Does that answer your question?''
   He is also not through working yet, continuing to tour regularly
and making plans to record again after several years without a new
album.
   ``I've written some new songs,'' he says. ``I've got enough for
a totally new record.''
   He's also thinking about an animated version for children of
``Alice's Restaurant,'' which was made into a movie in 1969.
   ``It would focus more on the Thanksgiving part and less on the
littering and draft parts,'' he says.
   He notes that the idea of dumping ``a half a ton of garbage'' by
the side of the road isn't as popular as it once was, even if the
dump was closed on Thanksgiving and you'd ``never heard of a dump
closed on Thanksgiving before.''
   ``Littering isn't such a good idea anymore,'' he says a bit
sheepishly. But then he adds with that quick laugh: ``I sure had a
lot of fun on that day though.'

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Novelist Finally Upstages Famed Sister</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After four novels, polite reviews and paltry
sales, A.S. Byatt has emerged from the shadow of her younger, more
prolific sister, novelist Margaret Drabble.
   Byatt's fifth and latest novel, ``Possession,'' scooped up
Britain's and Ireland's top literary awards and the hefty hardback
sold strongly leading up to Christmas.
   But the 54-year-old author is taking fame and fortune in stride.
   ``I'm too old to get awfully changed, yet young enough to enjoy
it,'' Byatt said in an interview.
   She has, however, become more wary. When ``Possession'' began
collecting rave reviews, she welcomed journalists into her home.
But after a catty comment or two about her housekeeping appeared in
print, she insists on doing interviews by telephone.
   Some of the $39,200 from the British Booker Prize and the
$45,000 from the Irish Times-Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize
have been spent on a few good suits and a London taxicab account.
The remainder will build a swimming pool at the author's house in
southern France and maybe buy a couple of pairs of shoes.
   ``Possession,'' in the tradition of John Fowles' ``French
Lieutenant's Woman,'' intertwines past and present: A modern
romance grows as two literary scholars discover, through poetry and
fragments of letters, an unknown relationship between two Victorian
poets.
   In her previous novels, Byatt worked with material from her own
life.
   ``It was a sort of pleasure not writing realistically about
anything I had actually experienced or knew ... the 19th century I
had to invent,'' she said.
   Antonia Susan Byatt was born in 1936 into the puritannical
household of a Yorkshire judge, John Drabble. She went to a Quaker
school, then to Cambridge where she graduated with honors. She
earned a master's degree at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was very unhappy there. I ... wanted something different and
got more of the same. I thought America would be big and modern
with chrome on everything, moving at twice the speed. Instead I was
in a Victorian building and a Victorian library with not a man in
sight,'' she said.
   Byatt taught American and English literature, including
Victorian poetry, at University College in London until 1983, when
she quit to write full time.
   Thirty years years ago, she gave the name Antonia to her first
daughter, and began calling herself A.S. Byatt.
   ``When I had my first child I was in a fit of despair. I was 23
and I thought she had better have this good name (Antonia) and
carry it on - for I shall never write a book,'' Byatt said.
   She and her first husband, Ian Byatt, also had a son, who was
killed in an accident at age 11. She and her second husband,
investment adviser Peter Duffy, have two daughters.
   Byatt published her first novel in 1964, and three more
followed. She also wrote a critical study of William Wordsworth and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge and another on novelist Iris Murdoch, and
edited George Eliot's ``The Mill on the Floss.''
   But it wasn't until her daughters had grown and she had
foresaken academia that she wrote ``Possession,'' with its strong
plot line and sexual tension.
   ``I had a very puritanical background and was taught to think
very hard about what was valuable in life, and from that background
novels aren't very valuable at all,'' she said.
   ``It's difficult to try and put anything first if you have
children, and until recently I wasn't at all quite sure that I
could put it first.''
   The author said her American publishers, Random House, were
concerned that ``Possession,'' at 511 pages and more than 1,700
lines of Victorian poetry, would be too academic for a broad
audience.
   ``People have made too much out of the fact that I'm an
academic. ... I am an artist not a career academic, but because I
talk about things as one knows things, people assume I am trying to
impress.''
   That impulse showed in her fourth novel, ``Still Life,''
published in 1985, about a playwright who becomes absorbed in his
subject, the painter Vincent van Gogh.
   ``You couldn't do it without doing the research, so I read the
letters, just reading a biography doesn't do it,'' Byatt said. She
also went to Amsterdam to study his paintings.
   Van Gogh appealed to Byatt because of their mutual passion for
light. She suffers from ``seasonally adjusted depression'' and must
sit in front of a bright light during winter.
   ``He is a paradigm of myself. I am obsessed with the sun and in
the south I start going too fast. When I am slightly on the edge of
being mad I get terribly speeded up like him, I know what he feels
like,'' she said.
   After years of comparisons with her younger sister, Byatt shrugs
off the reports of antagonism between the two.
   ``We get on fine, we don't see each other much and we don't look
for the worst in each other,'' Byatt said. She lives in cozy Putney
in south London, while her sister settled in tony Hampstead to the
north.
   Critics lazily tended to compare the two sisters, Byatt said,
``when there are other writers more interesting to be compared to.
... I don't mind being compared to Iris Murdoch, I learned a lot
from her and I admire her.''

   Sonny LeMaire of the band Exile figures
no one can match the group's diversity as an opening concert act.
   ``We've opened up for Aerosmith and George Jones,'' he says. ``I
don't think anybody in music can lay claim to that kind of
pedigree.''
   Twelve years ago, the band hit the top of the rock 'n' roll
charts with ``Kiss You All Over,'' a 1978 flash in the pan that
sold 5 million copies. That's when the group did concerts with
Arrowsmith. Six years later, the band developed a growing following
as a sizzling country music group with soaring harmonies and superb
instrumentation.
   It was the period in which the group opened concerts for Jones,
a country music legend.
   ``We've got a vault full of experiences,'' LeMaire says. ``It's
been amazing. I ought to write a book about it.''
   However, there's little time to write a book. The five-member
group, sidetracked in the past two years by the departure of three
members and the loss of a recording contract, is back with renewed
enthusiasm.
   With two replacements on board and a third coming in soon, Exile
has rejoined the ranks of country music kingpins.
   ``We've let people know that Exile never left and we're back
stronger than ever,'' LeMaire said.
   The group put out no new songs for about two years until
mid-1990. This followed the loss of their recording contract and
the disruption caused by the departure of Marlin Hargis, J.P.
Pennington and Les Taylor, who are now working independently in
music.
   But Exile signed with Arista Records and filled the vacancies in
the band with Lee Carroll, Paul Martin and Mark Jones.
   Their comeback album, ``Still Standing,'' has produced two top
10 country hits, ``Yet'' and ``Nobody's Talking.''
   ``This album should be multiplatinum (millions sold),'' LeMaire
said. ``I'd put it up against any of the others, song for song.
   Exile, of Lexington, Ky., became a sensation when the
little-known band released the controversial ``Kiss You All Over.''
   After followup rock 'n' roll records fizzled, the group returned
to Lexington and began playing regularly in a bowling alley lounge.
LeMaire even took a job in a pizza restaurant because he needed
money.
   ``It was a real difficult time. I cooked the pizzas and made the
strombolis,'' he said.
   At the bowling alley, Exile began perfecting a country sound
that earned them a recording contract with Epic Records. In the
mid-1980s, they were a dominant country band with an impressive
list of No. 1 records: ``Woke Up in Love,'' ``Give Me One More
Chance,'' ``Crazy for Your Love,'' ``She's a Miracle,'' ``Hang on
to Your Heart,'' ``I Could Get Used to You'' and ``She's Too Good
to Be True.''
   Exile has been around for 26 years, and the three new members
are the 19th, 20th and 21st to join.
   ``It's been cycle after cycle,'' said LeMaire, now the group's
bassist and lead vocalist. ``You get up and then you're down for a
while, and then you find some way to bring it back.
   ``No one promises you if you want to be in music, that it's
going to be an easy ride, because it's not. It's difficult, but
gratifying if you achieve any success at all.''
   LeMaire said he's never considered ``Kiss You All Over''
offensive even though some radio stations refused to play it
because of the suggestive title.
   ``The only thing that disturbs me is that the band is remembered
for that song only,'' he said.
   Exile, he says, has a lot more to offer: ``Good songs, good
playing, good harmony and a tremendous live show.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson
has written a stunning introduction to Harry N. Abrams' lovely new
book on the collagist Romare Bearden.
   Wilson was inspired by Bearden in creating his plays ``Joe
Turner's Come and Gone'' and ``The Piano Lesson.''
   When he first saw Bearden's art, Wilson said, ``It was the art
of a large and generous spirit that defined not only the character
of black American life, but also its conscience.'' Wilson received
the Pulitzer for ``Fences'' and ``The Piano Lesson.'' He also is
winner of Broadway's coveted Tony.
   ``Romare Bearden: His Life and Art,'' by Myron Schwartzman,
chronicles the artist's life from his birth in Charlotte, N.C.,
through his childhood during Prohibition to the Harlem Renaissance
to his death in 1988.
   The handsome book contains 230 illustrations of Bearden's
paintings, collages, drawings and sketches, and sells for $60.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - The first full account of the life and work of
Robert Rauschenberg, will focus on the artist's work through major
exhibitions from now through 1992.
   Harry N. Abrams' ``Rauschenberg: Art and Life,'' by Mary Lynn
Kotz, sells for $65 and contains 200 illustrations. It details the
artist's life from his birth in Port Arthur, Texas, to World War
II, to his decision to become an artist.
   The Whitney Museum of American Art currently has Rauschenberg's
silkscreen paintings from the 1960s on show. Other exhibits will be
held at the National Gallery of Art beginning in May, the Corcoran
Gallery in Washington in June, the Museum of Contemporay Art in
Chicago in the winter of 1992 and the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art in the spring of 1992.

<HEAD>Plan What Will Happen to Your Estate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL LOCHRAY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disposition of an individual's estate need not
be a guessing game.
   Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound estate
plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more
don't know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by
better understanding how the federal government governs estate
taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future federal tax
liabilities.
   This tax savings can preserve assets in the estate that
otherwise might be used to pay death taxes. These assets then may
be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity.
   There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate.
First, determine the nature and the value of your estate's assets.
Assts may include: your residence, other property such as a
vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks,
checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life insurance
policies, automobiles.
   For federal tax purposes, there are several exceptions to
determining the value of an asset:
   - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value
of the asset is included in your estate if you are the first spouse
to die.
   - For life insurance policies, the amount included in your
estate is the face amount of the policy rather than its replacement
cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your
death.
   - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your
pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your
spouse and half the vested plan benefits - what would have been
available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your
gross estate.
   - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value
when they mature.
   - All other assets generally are included at fair market value.
   Second, determine your deductions when calculating federal
estate tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of
the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and
administrative expenses for the estate.
   You'll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets
transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set
up a living trust, although it will create some trust
administration costs.
   In addition, property held in joint tenancy with right of
survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant
outside the probate process. Other property of a contractual nature
- such as life insurance policies or qualified pension plans - also
will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate.
   Step three, determine which property qualifies for the marital
deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference:
   - If your will transfers property to your spouse, this property
qualifies for the marital deduction.
   - If any property is held in joint tenancy with right of
survivorship, the property passes to the surviving spouse and
qualifies for the marital deduction.
   - If any life insurance or qualified pension plan names your
spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too,
qualifies.
   The same kinds of arrangements will qualify property for the
charitable estate tax deduction if property is left to the charity
as a result of a will, a specific property designation such as a
joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation.
   Any property qualifying for the marital deduction or the
charitable deduction is not subject to federal estate tax
liability. Remaining property is referred to as the taxable estate.
   The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated federal
tax liability on the taxable estate. The unified estate and gift
transfer tax rates apply to the taxable estate when calculating the
amount of federal estate tax.
   Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate,
is entitled to a unified credit of $192,800 that absorbs, dollar
for dollar, the amount of that individual's federal estate tax
liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any
lifetime gifts to an individual in any one year while alive that
exceeded the amount of the gift tax annual exclusion amount of
$10,000.
   Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your federal estate tax
liability to be greater than $192,800, your taxable estate must be
greater than $600,000.
   As long as a husband and wife each hold $600,000 in separately
owned assets, the couple can own a total of $1.2 million in assets
and the entire amount for both estates avoids federal estate tax
liability. The process of rearranging property ownership for estate
assets, so that each spouse's estate takes maximum advantage is
known as ``estate equalization.''
   Many people assume they won't have assets exceeding $600,000,
but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension
plans or life insurance policies, estates are often of surprising
size.

   Carefully kept records of triumphs, mistakes and
possibilities for better things may be the easiest way to
green-thumb results in gardening. And the start of the new year is
perfect for launching such record keeping or improving the present
system.
   For years, I used a dozen 10-by-12-inch envelopes, labeled by
the month, to accumulate notes. Things like: the Queen Sophia
marigolds started in April did better than those started a month or
so later.
   Placed in the April envelope, this was a memory-jogger the
following April to plant Queen Sophia seeds as soon as possible.
This system worked well but since retiring I switched to a computer
and, if forced to make the choice, would rather give up my
favorite, 35-year-old shovel.
   A neighbor nailed a 3-by-4-foot white cardboard to an inside
wall of her garage and ruled it off by months. Now she pencils in,
or erases, instructions such as ``prune the roses'' under January
or ``plant pepper transplants'' in late February.
   Another friend can garden mainly on Saturdays. An engineer, he
built a computer program based on his gardening experiences, and
each Friday asks the computer what to do the next day. It responds
with instructions such as ``sow seeds of chard, eggplant, leaf
lettuce, radish, spinach and tomato.''
   Whether that elaborate or, like mine, quite simple, a computer
program does a remarkable job in keeping gardening records.
   The most detailed I've seen, from Jeff Ball and Gary Gack, is
distributed by Rodale Press, Emmaus, Pa. for IBM computers and
compatibles. It keeps track of available space in the garden;
creates planting and harvesting dates; estimates seeds needed;
tells how to thin resulting plants and even provides a way to
advise the best times to turn the compost pile.
   Ortho also distributes an interesting commercial program. There
must be others.
   Information accumulated over the years in my dozen, dog-eared
envelopes was entered into an elementary database system known as
``file folders.'' Don't let the idea of a database scare you. There
is just one form to handle at a time, with blanks to fill in for
things such as plant name, date planted, date of first bloom, date
of first harvest, merit assessment, colors, exposure, location,
culture tips, etc.
   My form has nearly 50 permanent entries, but rarely are more
than a dozen or so spaces filled in a given year for any plant. So
that much detail is overkill. However, a printout will provide a
composite assessment, say, of the potatoes tried in the past 10
years or when the first rose is likely to bloom.
   Each weekend scatch-paper notes are entered onto each applicable
form. Updating records weekly becomes an easy routine.
   A couple cautions: First, the reason for gardening should be to
relax and enjoy yourself, so if the computer becomes ``work,''
re-evaluate. Second, be sure the ``file folder'' system allows a
sentence to expand (wrap to the next line) and doesn't limit
entries to a certain number of pre-determined characters.
   My first attempt at computerization limited the space for an
individual entry, and had to be abandoned after a year.
   Now, for example, when asked for February weather, the print out
will say: ``Water needs increase as temperatures warm and day
length increases. Deep, infrequent watering is best. Frost
precautions will be needed through the first three weeks.'' The
same question in July will get: ``triple digit all month.''
   When asked, the program will say what vegetables or flowers must
be planted by mid-February; advise what trees should be fertilized
in January and how much to apply; recommend annuals that produce
yellow flowers no taller than 24 inches, or say that some valencia
oranges should be ready for harvesting late in February. Everything
is based on what's happened in my garden.
   Too elaborate? Sure. A looseleaf notebook or the old envelope
system might do as well. But the computer is fun, keeps everything
quickly available and updating takes only a few keystrokes.
   And keeping adequate records actually simplifies things. A few
years ago, tired of hearing that tomatoes can't be grown in this
desert climate between winter's infrequent frost and summer's high
temperatures, I experimented with a dozen nationally touted
varieties. They were grown in day-long sun, morning sun, afternoon
sun and under a shade screen. Some were mulched. Some were staked.
All received the same supplemental irrigation and fertilizer.
   Clearly superior were celebrity and small fry. I've never
planted any others since. As the historians like to say (or is it
the philosophers?): Those who forget the lessons of history are
doomed to repeat the mistakes.

<HEAD>Woman Retires from Red Cross After 70 Years of Service.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly 70 years of service, Bernice
Galyean is hanging up her volunteer suit.
   Galyean was 19 when she joined the American Red Cross to help
survivors of a flood in Greenville, on the Mississippi River.
   ``I started in then,'' Galyean, 87, said. ``We were feeding the
people as they brought them in out of the water. They brought them
in in landing boats.''
   During World War II, she made bandaes and hospital gowns for
wounded soldiers and shipped Christmas packages to those still
fighting. Her work continued through Korea and Vietnam.
   ``She's been a volunteer all her life. We're real proud of Mrs.
Galyean. She's a real trooper,'' said Dorothy Reeves, local Red
Cross executive director.
   Now it's time ``to take life easy,'' Galyean said.
   ``I'm not able to do anything, to tell you the truth,'' she
said. ``That's why I'm retiring, because I can't get around.
Arthritis and rheumatism have got me.''
   Galyean grew up on a dairy farm outside Meridian with five
brothers and two sisters. Although she and her late husband, R.J.,
had no children, they raised four relatives.
   Galyean said she has received as much as she has given in a
lifetime of volunteer work.
   ``It's nothing more than I should have done,'' she said. ``They
did for me when I did for them.''

<HEAD>Villages Struggle for Survival in Japan's Graying Countryside</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINAMISHINANO VILLAGE, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stroll through the lanes
of this mountain town is a return to the past. Neighbors know each
other and each other's business. The air is pungent with sweet-sour
drying rice stalks.
   The walk also gives a glimpse of Japan's future. More than one
in four people in Minamishinano is 65 or older, roughly double the
national rate. In 30 years, one in every four Japanese will be old,
and the nation will face the struggle to care for them that now is
confronting this village.
   Japan's rapid industrialization drained the countryside of
youth; most of the people on Minamishinano's narrow streets and
tilling the rice and vegetable fields are elderly.
   Of the 775 people 65 or older in the village, several hundred
live isolated, high on the mountainsides. Others live along steep
paths that are treacherous in winter. They face a daily struggle to
bathe and feed themselves.
   The struggle to keep up their spirits is even harder:
   - Embarrassed by his failing health, an 81-year-old widower has
retreated into his home, refusing to talk to neighbors or visit the
village. Twice a week, Fukumi Nagusawa visits to cook and clean.
   ``Now, I'm the only person he'll talk with. All day he just lays
in his bed,'' says Mrs. Nagusawa, 35.
   - An woman in a spotless white apron wanders along the side of
the road, a younger woman at her elbow. ``She's senile. She spends
all day wandering around, and her daughter-in-law is with her all
the time,'' a villager explains.
   - ``I live all by myself, all alone,'' says one 72-year-old
woman. ``My body aches so badly that sometimes I just want to kill
myself.''
   Eleven elderly villagers reportedly committed suicide last year.
   Thirty-five years ago, this village deep in the mountains 100
miles southwest of Tokyo had thriving lumber and silk industries
and 6,563 residents.
   But many businesses have closed, unable to compete with imports.
Hillside homes were abandoned, young people headed for Japan's
urban areas, and the population dwindled to 2,882.
   By the 1970s, the social impact of the drain to the cities hurt
more than the economic consequences, said Shousuke Sakurai, a local
official in charge of services for the elderly.
   ``We began to notice many social problems. ... Old people were
depressed. Quite a few committed suicide,'' Sakurai said. ``It was
a very dark time.''
   Looking after his own bedridden mother convinced Sakurai the
community would have to be aggressive. Five years ago, he got
permission to develop a welfare program aimed at helping older
residents live comfortably at home.
   The village hired four part-time ``home helpers'' for housework
and cooking. It also built a center where the village's elderly can
bathe, socialize, get medical attention and eat a hot lunch for $3.
   One recent day, two old men gazed out a window of the center's
cafeteria at workers building a hostel for bedridden elderly and an
apartment building for the aged who require little help.
   ``They're as excited as if they're watching their own house
being built,'' Sakurai says.
   The government plans similar facilities for the entire country.
By the year 2000, there should be 10,000 apartment buildings for
older people. No such buildings existed last year.
   The government also plans to increase the number of day service
centers from 1,080 in 1989 to 10,000 in 2000 and to provide 50,000
hostel beds for short stays, up from 4,274 last year.
   Minamishinano's new facilities already are improving life, says
Yoko Arai, one of the center's eight staff members.
   ``Before, there was nothing for them. Now, many have become much
more cheerful. They sing and dance and make friends. For the people
living off by themselves in the hills, it's the only chance they
get to talk,'' she says.
   The 18 men and women in the center's sunny activities room were
chatting, playing chess and making handicrafts. At other times, a
rehabilitation specialist lectures on posture while explaining the
sources of various aches and pains.
   The elderly have refused to follow their children to the big
city, unwilling to give up their lives amid the mountainsides
yielding lush crops of rice, barley, vegetables and fruit. Living
space is plentiful, air is unpolluted, and the village river runs
fast and clear.
   But those attractions are lost on many young people. So at a
time when Japan is fighting in international arenas to maintain its
ban on rice imports, the number of farmers who benefit from such
policy is declining.
   In 1965, 68,000 graduates of high school and college became
farmers, but by 1989 the number was 2,100. Each year, the number of
farmers who quit far exceeds those who start.
   ``The lack of young successors to continue farming is the single
biggest problem facing Japan's farm sector today,'' says Munetoshi
Wada, an official in the Agriculture Ministry's ``Successor Policy
Division.''
   Special schools and start-up grants have done little to persuade
young Japanese to chose farming over white-collar work, Wada says.
   Those who remain - traditionally the oldest child inherits the
home - have trouble finding wives. Few young women welcome the
burden of farmwork in addition to caring for children, husband and
aging parents.
   Minamishinano is trying to replace the disintegrating old social
structure with a new one, says Iju Katamachi, an energetic doctor
who visits five or six homes daily.
   He says, ``Medicine has made it possible to keep bodies alive
longer, but psychologically and socially, we haven't caught up with
those advances.''

<HEAD>Researcher: Americans More Aware of Age Than Ever</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRED PIERETTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans live longer than in any other period of the nation's
history. They are also, ironically it seems, more obsessed about
age and growing old than ever.
   Look in any card shop for evidence. Row upon row of birthday
cards offer congratulations for every age group, from newborns to
90-year-olds. Cards for people reaching the current landmark 40th
birthday particularly abound as the baby boom generation enters
middle age.
   But it wasn't always so. Even in this century, prior to major
advances in medicine and education, growing old was not something
to be feted, said Dr. Gene Cohen, deputy director of the National
Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
   ``Today, there is a growing number of people who are aging
well,'' Cohen said. ``Earlier, when large numbers of people did not
age well, people expected a traumatic and dismal later life.''
   In fact, the American tradition of celebrating birthdays is
itself only about 100 years old, according to Howard P. Chudacoff,
a professor of history at Brown University. Chudacoff has traced
the evolution of age consciousness in this country in ``How Old Are
You?'' (Princeton University Press, 1990).
   Chudacoff, who specializes in the history of urban society,
writes that the arrival of the first birthday cards around the turn
of the century coincided with a growing emphasis on age: It was at
this time that children first were grouped into classes by age and
that pediatrics was established as a separate medical specialty.
   Scientific advances, improved nutrition, and changes in
demographic patterns as society became more urban also played a
role in enhancing the importance of age, Chudacoff said.
   ``Death could have come anytime in life 200 to 300 years ago,''
Chudacoff said in an interview. ``Death was part of everyday life.
People accepted it. ... Now we have confined death more to later
stages of life.''
   The annual marking of one's birthday became not only a personal
milestone, but a way for a person to relate to society.
   For trivia buffs, hudacoff also pinpointed the birth of ``Happy
Birthday'' - the most popular tune in the American repertoire - to
1934. ``Happy Birthday'' itself has thus only reached ``middle
age,'' a term which gained currency only after World War I,
Chudacoff writes.
   But the widespread celebration of birthdays and growing
awareness of age had its downside.
   Ageism is a ``discriminatory shorthand for representing certain
abilities in society,'' Chudacoff said, adding that lumping people
together according to age is ``too artificial'' as well as unfair.
   ``Like gender and race,'' the 47-year-old author writes, ``age
cannot be changed. To disadvantage individuals merely because they
possess a particular characteristic, one for which they cannot be
held morally responsible, offends traditionally American
sensibilities of fairness.''
   Chudacoff reiterated in the interview that ``age 65 does not
mean you lose all talents or productivity.''
   There are now more than 30 million people over 65 in the United
States, Cohen said. ``That is more than the population of Canada.''
   The fastest growing segment of the population is the age group
85 and over. The average life expectancy in this country is about
75 years for men, slightly higher for women.
   While Americans remain preoccupied with their individual
biological timeclocks, society's view of growing old is changing,
experts agree. Chudacoff also thinks age consciousness may have
peaked, that society is possibly entering into an era of ``age
irrelevance.''
   ``By the latter part of the 20th century, Amercians had become
more sensitive to the consequences of using age as a criterion for
social status and as a norm for behavorial expectations,''
Chudacoff says at the end of his study. ``Perhaps, as with racism
and sexism, this recognition also represents the peak of age
consciousness in the course of American cultural history.''
   Cohen agrees and describes this trend as the ``blending of
generations.''
   ``The blending of generations is escalating,'' maintains Cohen,
whose institute conducts research on aging. ``You look at someone
who is 65 (and) you don't think of them as old.''
   Chudacoff, however, argues that American society will still rely
on age as a tool to gauge achievement or buttress certain mores. It
will still be taboo, or at least frowned upon, for a 65-year-old to
marry a 25-year-old, he said.

   As Allen Furfine is finding out, it's never too
late to change the world.
   ``I'm going to do it one student at a time,'' said Furfine, 63,
a member of a tutoring program in which senior citizens help teach
youngsters to read.
   From all accounts the program, in its second year, has been a
success for pupils and tutors.
   ``We have just begun to scratch the surface of what this
population can do for this country,'' said Marylen Mann, national
director of the St. Louis-based OASIS, or Older Adult Service and
Information Services, which sponsors the program.
   ``We are developing a model of productive aging,'' she said.
``This is the time to discover who you are and what you can do.''
   OASIS, a non-profit organization for people older than 60, was
founded nine years ago. It provides educational, cultural and
wellness programs for 120,000 members in 20 cities.
   The tutoring program began in St. Louis and Denver last year and
is expanding to Phoenix and Rochester, N.Y., this year. Ms. Mann
hopes to add two or three cities a year.
   ``This is a tremendous program, and we are delighted to see it
flourish,'' said David Mahan, interim superintendent of St. Louis
public schools. Mahan said the tutors ``may prevent a lifetime of
pain and frustration that comes along with illiteracy.''
   Tutors are trained for 18 hours, then work with children ages 6
to 9. Tutors must commit to at least one hour of instruction a week
throughout the school year.
   Furfine, one of 40 people in the St. Louis area to volunteer,
retired from his engineering job at McDonnell Douglas Corp. three
years ago. He also had worked as a substitute teacher.
   ``In one way or another, I consider myself a teacher,'' Furfine
said. ``I've always thought it was a ball.''
   Celeste Felton, 69, worked with four children in St. Louis last
year. A retired registered nurse, she said the experience has
broadened her horizons.
   ``It's not an overnight thing,'' she said. ``You just can't run
in there and start motivating and teaching. You first have to find
out what the child likes.''
   Ms. Felton said she has used math, drawing and ``many other
doors'' to involve the child.
   ``These kids are supposed to be our future leaders,'' she said.
``The more they learn, the better off they will be. Whatever I'm
able to give, I'm happy to help out.''

<HEAD>Stunt Driver Who Once Wrecked Cars, Now Collects Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT LEISNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two decades, ``Lucky'' Lee Lott and his
Hell Drivers thrilled hundreds of thousands of people at state and
county fairs across the country with death-defying stunts.
   In the process, Lott figures, they demolished 17,981 cars.
   Lott and his daredevil drivers jumped cars, drove over burning
barrels, smashed into brick walls, did crash rolls, head-on
collisions and torpedo driving using dynamite to blow up the jalopy
- driver and all.
   ``You don't take a chance unless you have one,'' says Lott, who
is retired but still surrounds himself with jalopies - although now
he and his son fix them rather than wreck them.
   Parked just off Interstate 275 in Tampa is a 40-year-old relic -
a Nash painted orange with his old logo emblazoned on the side.
   Across three tree-shaded lots he owns on a dead-end street are a
dozen other cars, more than half of them made by Nash.
   During the past five years, Lott, 75, and his son Jerry estimate
they have worked on 40 cars. They've collected them, traded them,
used them for parts, repaired them and taken them to car shows.
   Total restoration takes a lot of tools and equipment, says Jerry
Lott, 39. ``We don't have all we need yet. We're still plugging
along. Besides, a lot of people can't afford to put that kind of
money into older cars.''
   On the small porch of their house are albums filled with faded
photographs, folders of articles, fliers and posters, a crash
helmet and other memorabilia of the 1935-1955 era.
   A native of Pekin, Ill., Lott got his first taste of thrill
driving in Muleshoe, Texas, near Odessa in 1934 when he and his
brother Neal wowed a crowd with a head-on crash in two junk cars.
The following year they got a farmer in Kewanee, Ill., to rent them
a field, put together a July 4 event and cleared $900, Lott said.
   In 20 years, Lott estimates he played 5,000 fairs, from tiny
Midwestern towns to such places as the New York Polo Grounds,
Chicago's Soldier Field and the Los Angeles Coliseum, where the act
drew 106,000 people - the biggest crowd of his career. The smallest
was 14 people in Gay Mills, Wis., in 1946 when a polio scare closed
a number of spots on the circuit, he said.
   Although some stunts backfired, Lott said he was only seriously
hurt once. In 1941, in Steubenville, Ohio, the throttle stuck on an
old Ford as he began a 100-foot jump over a school bus.
   He sailed a record 169 feet. The landing cracked his spine. He
cleared the cars he was supposed to land on - the ones positioned
to cushion the shock.
   ``I couldn't imagine living those days today. The cars now
wouldn't take what we dealt out to them. We had the protection of
steel around us. Today, the cars are too flimsy, too springy.''
   He's been ``Lucky'' since he was a teen-ager. ``I am lucky,'' he
insists. ``I'm still here. I knew what I was doing.''
   And he still drives. But now, he says, ``I drive cautiously -
defensively.''

   Pan Am and TWA, two of the oldest and weakest
airlines, said they were close to a combination that would end
their rivalry and mark a dramatic consolidation in the troubled
industry.
   Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn had proposed a
buyout of Pan Am Corp. last weekend in a deal worth about $375
million. Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett responded with a letter
Friday saying such an arrangement could be ``advantageous to our
shareholders, employees and other constituencies.''
   But Plaskett said Pan Am would need an infusion of cash before
the purchase could be completed.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal government ran up a $48.1 billion
deficit in November, a 62 percent increase over a year ago, due in
part to the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing economy, the
Treasury Department reported.
   Combined with the October deficit, the imbalance for the first
two months of fiscal 1991 totaled $79.5 billion, up 42.5 percent
from the comparable period of fiscal 1990, the government said
Friday.

   BOSTON (AP) - Bank of New England Corp. would receive an
injection of $605 million in capital if the ailing company agrees
to a proposed debt-for-equity swap.
   Committees representing holders of $705 million worth of Bank of
New England bonds have agreed to exchange their bonds for stock
that will give them 92 percent ownership of the company, Wilbur
Ross, who represents some of the bond holders, said Friday.
   Under the swap, debt would be reduced from $705 million to $100
million. The $605 million difference would be converted to equity
capital for the bank.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Infotechnology Inc., the cash-strapped owner of
Financial News Network and United Press International, said it
could not repay a $20.7 million loan that was called in early.
   The lenders, Security Pacific National Bank and MidLantic
National Bank, said Friday they have the right to foreclose on
Infotechnology's 46 percent stock interest in FNN, a cable
television network.
   FNN reported a $72.5 million loss for its 1990 fiscal year. UPI,
a news wire service, reportedly has been losing as much as $2.5
million a month.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviet Union owes $55.2 billion abroad,
putting it among the world's top debtors, according to a study by
the International Monetary Fund.
   The IMF said Friday the total reflected figures from last June,
based on calculations of its own staff.
   The CIA put net Soviet debt last year at $33.3 billion.
According to the World Bank, the fund's sister organization,
Indonesia's debt - the fifth largest in the Third World - was $53.1
billion last year.

   CINCINNATI (AP) - General Electric Co. says it has begun an
internal probe as a result of Israel's investigation into whether
Israeli military officers accepted bribes while buying U.S.-made
equipment.
   Israeli prosecutors had said they had agreed to a plea bargain
by a senior Israeli Air Force officer accused of accepting millions
of dollars in bribes while purchasing U.S. military equipment.
   GE spokesman George Jamison said Friday that GE began an
internal investigation after learning of the Israeli probe. General
Electric is a major producer of military and civilian jet engines.

   LONDON (AP) - The advertising and marketing giant WPP Group PLC

weak cash flow.
   The owner of the U.S.-based J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp;
Mather Worldwide advertising agencies said Friday its priority was
to conserve cash.
   WPP has grown into the largest ad and marketing group in the
world through acquisitions over the past five years, but has seen
growth in its businesses slowed by the economic weakness in the
United States and Great Britain.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Despite falling short of circulation goals, the
sports newspaper The National said it will boost the daily cover
price by a quarter to 75 cents, effective Jan. 21.
   In addition, the newspaper said Friday it would test a $1 daily
price for one or two of its 10 metropolitan editions.
   The move comes as the 11-month-old newspaper has yet to prove
there are enough readers to sustain the first all-sports daily in
the United States and amid an anemic advertising market.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The Horn &amp; Hardart Co., one of America's
pioneering restaurant companies and owner of New York City's last
Automat, announced plans to divest the last of its eateries.
   The move, announced Friday, would mark the end of the company's
storied foray into food, which dates to the turn of the century
when luncheonette owners Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart teamed up in
1902 to open their first Automat in Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Consumers Reduce Spending to Prepare for Recession</HEAD>

   American consumers are telling it like it is.
   ``You can't even find a job. If you want a job, you can't find
one. This here messenger, I don't like it,'' complains Miguel
Torres of New York.
   ``We were thinking about buying a second car, but we'll have to
hold off,'' frets Patti Johnson, a Canton, Ga., housewife and
mother.
   ``We were planning to go to Naples, Fla., for awhile and we're
not going to do that,'' says Erica Grasman, a retired travel agent
in Deer Park, Long Island.
   However they phrase it, many consumers believe the economy is in
a recession or about to enter one. And these perceptions determine
their buying habits - habits which until now have been the driving
force behind eight years of economic growth.
   And they're not buying, according to government statistics and
surveys of retail stores.
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity. If that declines, it often is enough to throw the U.S.
economy into a tailspin.
   The Commerce Department said last week that consumer spending
declined in November for the second straight month, when adjusted
for inflation.
   Retail sales also fell in November and are sluggish this month
despite the holidays. Even before Christmas, retailers are putting
merchandise on sale.
   Economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. says consumers are
``hunkering down'' because of declining incomes and job losses
``and I think that hunkering down will extend through almost all of
1991.''
   The growth in personal income stalled in November, except for an
increase in farm subsidies, the Commerce Department says. And
according to Labor Department statistics, 900,000 people have lost
their jobs since last summer, helping to push the jobless rate to
5.9 percent. Many who remain employed are working fewer hours.
   ``People's purchasing power is being squeezed,'' says economist
Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington.
   Adding to the consumers' plunging confidence in the economy are
worries about a possible war in the Middle East and the initial
surge in oil prices after Iraq stormed Kuwait and disrupted the
world market.
   Inflation has since moderated but consumers continue to be
cautious, often avoiding expensive purchases and looking for sales.
   Susan Naujokaitis of San Diego says she has postponed her
shopping because retailers seemed frightened that spending was
falling. ``As long as the stores are scared, I'm waiting,
definitely'' for end-of-the-season sales, she says.
   Some, however, haven't waited for markdowns at major retailers,
shopping instead at discount stores.
   For instance, Darlene Waldrop, a Pasadena, Calif., accountant,
cut her Christmas budget from $500 to $200 this year - doing all
her shopping at bargain-club ``warehouse'' stores.
   Although Ms. Waldrop says her job at a health maintenance
organization appears secure, California aerospace companies have
cut employment severely this year and this could eventually have an
impact on her employer.
   ``It makes you more careful,'' she says.
   Some consumers have become more creative.
   Actress Lyndsay Dawkins says Hollywood appears to be
belt-tightening too, so ``this year, I've thought of gifts that I
can make.''
   Wyn Smith of Woodstock, Ga., who just found another job after
being laid off, says she's cut back her Christmas spending by about
25 percent. ``I've made a lot of stuff this year - crafts,'' she
explains.
   But it's not just Christmas shopping that's been devastated by
consumer concern. Automobile sales remain dismal. The housing
industry is in its deepest decline since the 1981-82 recession.
   ``I postponed the purchase of a new automobile for my wife at
least until June 1991, and even then I will be very critical of the
economic picture before making a purchase,'' says Buck Buchanan who
lives in the exclusive Hollywood Hills section of Los Angeles.
   For Donald Hirsch, a San Bernardino independent auto wholesaler,
the tough times started three years ago, when retail sales of new
cars fell and used cars rose. That prompted dealers to buy more
secondhand cars, leaving fewer for the independents.
   ``The wholesale market has dried up and those guys are out there
fighting for cars,'' said Hirsch's wife Karen. ``I think they
should stop calling it a recession and start calling it a
depression.''
   Rick Williams and his wife, waiting at a Tulsa shopping mall
while their daughter posed with Santa Claus, said they've delayed
buying their house because of economic uncertainty.
   Even those consumers whose jobs are intact express concern over
the economy.
   ``I'm starting my eleventh year at the firm and this would be
the first year I haven't received a holiday bonus,'' frets July
Huffman, a Los Angeles legal secretary.
   ``I have a steady income, but I know others who don't have a lot
put away, says Cody Payne of Tulsa, Okla. ``They'll be having
trouble making payments.''
   Some of the more fortunate still express concern over the
growing number of jobless and homeless people.
   A New York television producer, who asked to remain anonymous,
was telling a reporter that his planned Christmas caviar
``splurge'' for his parents has been cut in half when he
interrupted himself in mid-sentence.
   ``This sounds so awful,'' he resumed. ``There are poor starving
people everywhere. It's horrible out and I am worrying about these
things?''
   Bob Halliday, a Stratford, Conn., professor who says his income
is not threatened, nevertheless is cutting back on his spending too
- so that he could contribute more to the Salvation Army and other
charitable causes.
   ``It's not a big deal,'' he says. ``But it's something - on a
professor's salary, it is something ... There are some beautiful
people on the street that deserve a better way.''

   After a year of unprecedented food shortages, bare
store shelves and long lines, can it be that even the Russian
version of Santa Claus will be carrying an empty sack?
   Da, humbug.
   Shoppers complain bitterly that they cannot find the toys their
children so desperately want for New Year's Day - the gift-giving
holiday most Soviets celebrate instead of Christmas.
   On the morning of Jan. 1, Soviet children will wake up early and
receive their presents from Ded Moroz, or ``Grandfather Frost,'' a
jolly old white-bearded elf similar to Santa Claus.
   But the Evening Moscow newspaper wrote this month that the
Soviet economy was so bad, ``not even Ded Moroz, with his magic
powers, can solve the shortages, and his sack may be empty.''
   In the selection of toys at Detsky Mir, the cavernous,
five-story children's store adjacent to KGB headquarters in
Dzherzhinsky Square, there's not much that would hold a child's
interest for long.
   There were lots of inexpensive crude plastic items, such as
lambs, elves and rabbits best suited for playing with in the
bathtub, simple trucks and cars, toy guns, tambourines and small
toy soldiers for sale. There seemed an oversupply of toy men with
headbands and spears in a box marked simply ``Indians.''
   But there were no battery-operated toys or electronic games, and
no dolls for sale, even though some were displayed in the store's
huge picture windows.
   Marina, a 30-year-old Muscovite who wouldn't give her last name,
was near tears as she explained her desperation in one of the
store's dingy corridors.
   ``There are absolutely no presents for children,'' she said. ``I
have a daughter and two nieces and I wanted to buy New Year's
presents for all three of them, but I couldn't find anything.''
   ``My daughter is 7. She wants a Barbie doll,'' Marina said, her
voice breaking with emotion. ``I am ready to pay 100 rubles for a
Barbie, but it is impossible to buy it even for 100 rubles. I feel
very bad about it.
   One hundred rubles is more than a week's salary for an average
Soviet worker.
   Olga Kirianova, who has sons aged 9 and 4, said her oldest child
wanted a tabletop hockey game from Grandfather Frost, ``but I can't
find it for him.''
   ``I was here a couple of days ago and there were no toys at all
in the whole shop,'' she said.
   The faltering economy was spoiling the holiday for everyone,
said Ms. Kirianova, 30.
   ``In general, the mood of the people is very low,'' she said.
``We don't feel that the New Year holiday is coming. We are
concerned only with problems of what and where to buy.''
   Her shopping companion tugged at her sleeve and said
encouragingly, ``Come on, let's try to find that hockey game.''
   A weary-looking Nadia Strastnichuk paused at a counter that sold
holiday decorations and said she was frustrated in her search for a
remote-control car or construction set for her 10-year-old son.
   ``My child thinks that Grandfather Frost will bring him a
present. I've been looking for a week already, but without any
success. ... And here there are only some plastic toys, which no
one needs,'' said Strastnichuk, 30.
   ``I can't say any more,'' she said. ``I am so tired.''
   Yelena Ilyinichna, a graying sales clerk in Department No. 136
at Detsky Mir for 25 years, said the best toy she had for sale was
a small jeep-like car. ``Made in Smolensk!'' she touted to a
customer, rolling it on the glass countertop.
   She said most shoppers were looking for electronic games, model
trains, mechanical or battery-operated playthings - ``interesting
and complicated toys, and not these simple cars,'' she said.
   ``I feel very sorry for our customers, and for myself as I can't
unfortunately offer them anything worth buying,'' she said.

<HEAD>Battle Looming on Federal Subsidies for Rural Electric Co-ops</HEAD>

   The rural cooperatives that provide power to
25 million Americans are massing a defense against Bush
administration attempts to cut off the billions in federal dollars
that subsidize them.
   Administration strategists, looking for ways to trim the
mushrooming budget deficit, are quietly trying to pull the plug on
federal subsidies to electric cooperatives.
   But powerful rural interests and their congressional supporters
are marshalling forces to keep those subsidies in place. Without
federal help, they argue, some of the nation's 1,000 or so electric
co-ops could go under.
   ``We'll go to the Congress and we'll open political fire on''
President Bush, said Bob Bergland, executive vice president of the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the industry's
lobbying group.
   The focal point of the fight is the Rural Electrification
Administration, the federal agency that funnels billions of dollars
in low-interest loans and loan guarantees to electric cooperatives
across the country.
   A handful of the co-ops are in default on $2.3 billion in loans
from the REA. Three of them are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization: Colorado-Ute Electric Association Inc., Wabash
Valley Power Association Inc. and Eastern Maine Electric
Cooperative Inc.
   The REA is working with another seven troubled co-ops to help
restructure their debts.
   While only a small fraction of the co-ops are in serious
trouble, nearly all of them have borrowed from the REA, which they
now owe some $36 billion. REA Administrator Gary C. Byrne said
recently the agency's lending program must be tightened to make it
more responsible.
   Cheap federal loans and loan guarantees have been the backbone
of the rural electrification program since it began 50 years ago
under the New Deal. The program changed the face of American
agriculture by providing cheap power that allowed farmers to
modernize.
   But critics - including strategists in the White House Office of
Management and Budget - say it has outlived its purpose and
shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers.
   Around 98 percent of U.S. farms had electricity by 1964,
compared with only 9.5 percent in 1929, before the REA was
established.
   ``The program has long since achieved its goals and ... the
continued federal assistance is both costly and unjustified,''
economist Ronald Utt asserted in a study published in June by the
conservative Heritage Foundation. He said the electric co-ops
should become ``entirely reliant on private-sector sources of
credit.''
   The OMB recently sent a memo to the Energy Department outlining
a proposal to cut federal subsidies to the big public power
marketers, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the
Bonneville Power Administration. Included in the memo was a
recommendation to phase out all REA subsidies to electric
cooperatives over 10 years.
   That recommendation is likely to be the flashpoint early next
year when Bush submits his annual budget proposal to Congress,
where rural Democrats sympathetic to the co-ops control REA's
funding. Observers believe there is a strong chance the OMB
proposal will be included in the budget package. OMB spokesman Tom
Bruce declined comment on the matter.
   Joelle Ziemian, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, would
only say that the recommendations had been forwarded to Bush.
   OMB's idea isn't new. The Nixon and Reagan administrations,
espousing a free-market approach, tried to gut the REA and force
the co-ops to borrow in the private market. But the attempts were
roundly defeated by the power of the co-ops' lobby and their
congressional supporters.
   Many observers expect the Bush administration's initiative to
meet the same fate.
   ``It's not going to happen; the Congress won't go for it,'' said
David Freeman, a former TVA head who now is general manager of the
Municipal Utility District in Sacramento, Calif.
   Bergland, who was agriculture secretary in the Carter
administration, is plugged into the Washington power grid and is
considered a highly effective lobbyist. He has led the National
Rural Electric Cooperative Association since 1984.
   The NRECA ``is one of the most powerful lobbies in the world,''
said Fred Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
a Washington think tank.
   Through its political action committee, the NRECA contributed a
total $577,975 to the congressional campaigns of 242 Democrats and
126 Republicans who ran in last month's elections. Most of the
money went to incumbent senators and representatives, Federal
Election Commission records show.
   ``We take a very hard, uncompromising view on maintaining the
REA,'' Bergland said in an interview at his Washington office.
   While admitting that REA's original mission of electrifying
farms has long been accomplished, Bergland and congressional
supporters insist the subsidies are still needed to maintain the
service. They say some bankers are reluctant to make loans to
electric co-ops.
   Most rural cooperatives buy electricity in bulk from other
companies and distribute it to customers. The biggest financial
losses have been sustained by some of the larger co-ops that have
built plants to generate their own power.
   If the government stops making and guaranteeing loans to
cooperatives, the generating co-ops would be crippled, Bergland
said. ``There isn't a chance in the world they can survive,'' he
warned, adding that $20 billion in REA loans to generating co-ops
would be put at risk.
   If that happened, taxpayers likely would have to bail out the
REA, as they did when the federal Farm Credit System lost billions
of dollars in the agricultural slump of the mid-1980s.
   The REA program has potent supporters on Capitol Hill, most
notably Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on Rural Development.
   Whitten declined to be interviewed until he had been briefed on
current developments by the subcommittee staff, his spokesman Steve
Burtt said.
   But Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House
Agriculture subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural
development, said ``Congress will ask very deep and probing
questions'' of the administration on the REA budget issue.
   English said the administration ``might be able to pull a fast
one'' with REA funding on the House floor. He contends that the
opposition to co-op aid is really ideological but has been
disguised as concern about the budget deficit.

   The rows of honey-cured hams waiting to be
stacked aboard Federal Express jets gave a clear message to those
in the know. It was Christmas time, and time was running out.
   ``When it gets late they go for things like hams, packaged
foods. Things you can order from a catalogue or a store that'll
send them straight to us,'' said Dan Copp, a Federal Express
spokesman and makeshift tour guide for the airline's sprawling
cargo hub at Memphis.
   With the largest cargo airline in the world, Federal Express
stays busy year round, but the basic organized madness of its
Memphis hub gets even brisker as the Christmas deadline nears.
   The holiday season starts making itself known in November, when
the package delivery company typically handles 1.5 million items
worldwide. This year's one-day record was over 2 million on Dec.
20.
   The company guarantees overnight service anywhere in the United
States, but for the standard last-minute holiday shoppers, Friday
was the deadline for pre-Christmas delivery.
   Federal Express was founded in Memphis on a hub system that
brought all packages here from throughout the country before
reshipment to their final destinations. The system has been
modified somewhat over the years, but 65 percent of Federal
Express' packages still move through Memphis, the company's
``superhub.''
   It is aptly named.
   With some 1.4 million square feet of covered space, the total
hub takes up 295 acres. More than 5,500 workers labor in the hub
when it's humming, and 35 miles of conveyor belts carry thousands
of packages through a stainless steel network of platforms, stairs
and observation towers.
   Hallways throughout the hub are dotted with closed-circuit TVs
broadcasting a constant flow of information for workers, from
weather reports and package volumes to the latest employee stock
options.
   Federal Express has 94,000 workers worldwide.
   At the Memphis hub's first level for separating the thousands of
items from around the country, hustling workers put packages on a
conveyor belt and key their ZIP codes into a computer. The computer
times a package's movement along the belt and a mechanical arm
swings out at the appropriate moment to move it from one belt to
another depending on the code.
   Before long, all items for California end up heading to one
general area while those for, say, North Carolina take another
route. The hub has 19 substations based on ZIP codes.
   Teams of workers at those various stations make finer
destination distinctions. Once selected for a particular route, an
item is then packed with hundreds of others in enclosed shipping
containers that link up to move through the hub like small trains.
Led by tractors, the trains then head outside to the jets.

   From the weakened Bank of New England to the
neighborhood savings bank, experts say the region's financial
institutions are limping into a recession they helped cause.
   The economic slowdown sweeping New England is part cyclical. But
bankers and economists say it also reflects the extraordinary
overoptimism displayed by lenders in the booming 1980s, optimism
rivaled only by that of the Southwest's savings and loan managers.
   ``Bankers are just scared stiff that they are in a Texas-style
freefall that could envelop all the region's banks,'' said Paul
Getman, an analyst with Regional Financial Associates, a banking
consultant based in Westchester, Pa.
   ``This is a banking-led recession, there's no question about
that,'' Getman said. ``That is why it is particularly bad in the
New England area and why that area is the worst in the nation.''
   New England's economy is far more diverse and able to absorb a
slump than was the oil-based economy of Texas in the 1980s. And
strict zoning laws in New England acted as a brake on
overdevelopment. Texas had no such restrictions and left itself
wideopen for the inevitable bust following the boom.
   ``Every major bank holding company in Texas essentially
failed,'' said Ken Guenther of the Independent Bankers Association
of America, a Washington-based banking association. ``That's not
going to happen in New England. But there won't be a light at the
end of the tunnel until real estate values stabilize.''
   Statistics generated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. bear
out the weakened condition of banking in New England.
   Massachuesetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine were among
the top six states in terms of commercial bank losses in the first
three quarters of the year.
   The FDIC reported that ``There is little prospect of near-term
improvement in the Northeast.''
   In a sign that banks expect times to get leaner, the 180
commercial banks in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut
sharply increased their reserves for bad loans this year.
   Savings banks, which were once limited to small-scale loans,
much like the savings and loan institutions, dominate New England
banking and they, too, are in trouble. Three-quarters of the
nation's 471 savings banks are in New England.
   A recent House banking subcommittee report referred to ``severe
weakness'' among savings banks and to earnings that had
``nosedived.''
   Even some bankers admit that lending practices by their
colleagues contributed to the economic slide.
   ``I believe that it was an overextension of credit in commercial
real estate,'' said Jasper J. Jaser, president of Prime Bank in
Orange, Conn. ``Banks were lending against equity which did not
exist,'' said Jaser, who is also chairman of Connecticut's
Independent Bankers Association.
   The situation in Connecticut, Jaser said, ``is still in a state
of deterioration.'' He predicted that ``several banks'' would close
or be swallowed up by larger banks.
   The nation's banking community is closely watching the Bank of
New England, which is based in Boston and also owns Connecticut's
largest bank, Connecticut Bank and Trust.
   ``Not one banker wants to see Bank of New England fail because
it will cast a pall over all of them,'' said Getman of Regional
Financial Associates.
   Anticipating a possible spate of closures, the FDIC has opened a
field office in Franklin, Mass., with 350 employees ready to handle
the work that goes along with a bank failure.
   Not everyone blames the banks for causing the economic downturn.
Lawmakers from the region have been harshly critical of what they
call excessive federal regulation of New England banks. Others have
blamed overly restrictive laws.
   Michael DeVito of the Rhode Island Bankers Association said
federal tax reform in 1986 made real estate a less attractive
investment and contributed to the downturn in New England, where
real estate is an important part of the economy. In addition,
DeVito said, the 1980s saw the growth of investment firms that
could offer mutual funds and compete with banks for depositors'
dollars.
   But state and federal officials may be in no mood to ease
restrictions on banking, as DeVito advocates. If anything, the
pressure may be in the opposite direction, according to Jaser,
Prime Bank's president. The errors of banks over the past several
years may lead to reforms that more strictly control lending.
   ``I don't believe this is going to be looked at in the future as
a cyclical situation,'' Jaser said. ``I believe there are going to
be some serious ramifications.''

   The stock market declined broadly today in a
slow Christmas eve session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.86 to
2,619.80 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 286 up, 722 down and
461 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.78 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Only minimal activity was expected during the session, which was
scheduled to close at 2 p.m. EST, two hours earlier than usual.
   Analysts said traders took their cues from the bond market,
where interest rates rose.
   Prices of long-term government bonds dropped almost $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields around 8.36 percent.
   Buying interest in stocks also was muted by worries that the
situation in the Persian Gulf would inhibit any market rallies
heading into the early days of 1991.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon slipped &lsqb; to 50|;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost &rsqb; to 30\, and Pepsico dropped &rsqb;
to 26. But American Express rose &lsqb; to 21&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, in part
reflecting fears of political turmoil in the Soviet Union.
   Some analysts believe the Soviet government is in danger of
collapsing. If violence erupts there, traders fear the United
States will suspend grain sales and other food aid to Moscow, said
Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   On the other hand, he said, the looming prospects for war in the
Middle East are considered bullish for the grain markets.
   Trading activity was light in a Christmas Eve session that was

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Bank warned foreign banks and financial
institutions Monday not to accept illegal payments in rubles from
Soviet banks and businesses.
   The central bank said Soviet enterprises recently have tried to
make tens of billions of rubles worth of payments to foreign
companies, claiming they have the government's backing.
   But Soviet law forbids either individuals or businesses from
exporting more than 30 rubles without special permission.
   The ruble is not convertible, and Soviet businesses and joint
ventures pay foreign bills either with hard currency through bank
transfers or by barter arrangements.
   ``There have been numerous reports recently by various sources
about the emergence of payment documents in rubles - payable
checks, bills, letters of guarantee - issued by Soviet banks and
enterprises for tens of billions of dollars,'' the bank said in a
statement carried by the Tass news agency.
   The statement did not identify the companies.
   ``It is claimed that some of these commitments have been
guaranteed by the U.S.S.R. State Bank. Neither the U.S.S.R. State
Bank nor the Soviet Finance Ministry has given such permission to
Soviet banks and enterprises,'' it said.
   The Soviet Union is concerned about an accumulation of rubles
abroad, which could be dumped back into the economy without notice,
or at some inconvenient time such as when the ruble is made
convertible.
   The State Bank on Monday also warned that some Soviet companies
are making deals to import goods and pay foreign companies more
rubles than the government-set exchange rate.
   The foreign firms are using these rubles to buy large quantities
of Soviet goods - preferably raw materials - export them and make
huge profits, the bank said.
   ``This practice undermines money circulation, increases
inflationary processes in the country and postpones the
convertibility of the Soviet currency,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   Karl H. Hinke, a longtime banking
executive who created the MasterCard credit card, has died at age
84.
   Hinke, the former chairman of the Interbank Card Association and
a retired executive of Marine Midland Bank, where he worked for 55
years, died Saturday at his home in East Aurora, outside Buffalo.
   MasterCard was started in 1966 as a competitor to the card
issued by Bank of America after that bank, which was licensing
other banks to issue its card, refused Marine Midland a license
because Marine was too big.
   Hinke, then executive vice president of the Buffalo-based Marine
Midland, persuaded Marine to start a credit card association in
competition with Bank of America.
   The trial credit card operation was started in Binghamton and
spread to Jamestown, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. It then
attracted other East Coast banks, including Chase Manhattan, Mellon
Bank and the Bank of Detroit, which formed the Interbank Card
Association in 1966.
   By the end of 1967, there were 150 members, and Interbank
eventually overtook Bank of America, which consolidated its efforts
and became a member of InterBank. Its credit card originally was
named Master Charge and later was renamed MasterCard.
   Earlier in his career with Marine Midland, Hinke brought the
bank into the business of financing accounts receivable and
inventory for companies unable to obtain unsecured financing - a
novel idea in banking when Hinke proposed it in the late 1930s.
   Hinke, a World War II veteran of the Marine Corps, retired from
Marine Midland's board of directors in 1971 and from the Marine
Advisory Council, a group of former Marine directors, in 1982.
   He is survived by Donne, his wife of 43 years, and a son,
Frederick William of Leesburg, Va. Services will be private.

   Wheat futures prices closed moderately higher
Monday on the Chicago Baord of Trade after a late rally linked to
fears of weather damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Oat futures also advanced while corn and soybean futures ended
mostly lower in a shortened Christmas Eve trading session.
   After nearly a week of record-breaking frigid weather in the

which could increase winterkill if this weather continues - and it

changes in the Soviet Union could lead to civil unrest, a military
crackdown and a cutoff in U.S. food aid, he said.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is paying two
traders more than $1 million a year and other top executives
hundreds of thousands of dollars during the firm's costly
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Drexel confirmed Monday that 29 senior executives and traders
are receiving more than $250,000 a year each. But the firm said the
salaries were set early in the case, are necessary to manage its
business and are on a par with compensation elsewhere on Wall
Street.
   A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, said the firm was trying to
control expenses for its own benefit and that of creditors, who
stand to gain more money in a reorganization if the firm can hold
down costs.
   The report comes as salaries and compensation fall at major Wall
Street firms during an industry-wide recession.
   Drexel documents show the firm is paying a total of $35 million
to its sharply reduced staff of about 290 employees, or an average
of $121,000 a year. Of that, $21.1 million is for 73 officers and
$14.05 million for the rest of the staff.
   Two traders, Robert Beyer and Mark Attanasio, who are managing
directors in capital markets, are receiving $1.45 million each,
according to the documents, which first were reported in The New
York Times and confirmed by the firm.
   The confidential documents, which were given to several
creditors committees, detail Drexel's finances through October. The
firm said the compensation figures are annualized.
   David Boies, an attorney representing government thrift agencies
suing Drexel for alleged fraud in the sale of junk bonds, said the
salaries and other expenses such as legal costs were depleting
Drexel's estate.
   Boies said that while some salaries obviously were needed to run
Drexel during its Chapter 11 proceedings, ``We don't believe the
amount is being kept to a reasonable, necessary minimum.''
   ``Every dollar that is paid out unnecessarily is potentially a
dollar less for the taxpayers to recover,'' he said. Boies
represents the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Resolution Trust
Corp. in claims against Drexel.
   Drexel's parent filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February
and the brokerage subsidiary followed suit in May. The firm has
stated it plans to emerge as a reorganized entity that would, among
other things, be involved in restructuring distressed companies.
   Boies said Drexel's listed assets - about $2 billion - fall far
short of covering the firm's liabilities, including lawsuits
seeking tens of billions of dollars in alleged damages. Drexel last
year admitted to six criminal counts related to illegal trading.
   The FDIC and RTC lawyers have called for liquidating the firm,
saying there was no chance Drexel could reorganize as a viable
business. Two judges involved in the case have balked at supporting
a liquidation.
   The Drexel spokesman said the firm independently had asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Francis Conrad for permission to hire a firm to
review its compensation structure and help set payouts for 1991.
The report is due in Janaury.
   ``These compensation levels have been under careful and
continuous oversight by the board of directors, by the creditors
and by the equity committee,'' Anreder said. ``Drexel has been
living in a fishbowl as far as its expenses and compensation is
concerned.''
   ``This notion that we're excessively paying people is
inaccurate,'' he said.
   Anreder said Drexel needed to pay competitive salaries to
executives and top traders to keep them at the firm to help devise
a reorganization plan and manage its large but tough-to-sell
portfolio of junk bonds.
   He also said some executives are crucial to the firm retaining
an ``institutional memory'' so it can respond to about 13,000 civil
claims filed in the bankruptcy.
   For instance, Anreder said the presence of some longtime
executives has been critical in helping Drexel increase receipts
from other bankruptcy cases in which the firm is a creditor.
   The debate is not the first one involving compensation at
Drexel. Questions over some $260 million in payments made by the
firm shortly before it filed for Chapter 11 still are unresolved.
   Drexel during the 1980s was known as the highest paying firm on
Wall Street, where compensation routinely was in the millions of
dollars. Best known is the firm's $550 million 1987 compensation
for now-convicted financier Michael Milken.

   Dawson complained that theEPA didn't appoint six scientists the
Tobacco Institute had proposed for the expert panel. ``I think a
strong argument can be made that the deck is stacked against us,''
she said.
   But Richard Daynard, an attorney and chairman of the Tobacco
Products Liability Project in Boston, said he didn't understand why
the tobacco industry had been made a party to the deliberations.
   ``Nobody's talking in these proceedings about regulating the
tobacco industry,'' he said. ``They're talking about regulating
individual behavior. They basically have no business being in there
at all, and instead they've been given a preferential window into
the private deliberations of the EPA.''
   EPA officials denied the industry was given special access. And
they gamely proceeded with the meeting of the expert panel in
Arlington.
   The result was a stronger affirmation of the EPA's conclusions
than the agency's staff expected.
   ``We are persuaded that the evidence exists ... for considering
that ETS does cause lung cancer in non-smokers,'' said the panel's
chairman, Morton Lippmann of New York University.
   The tobacco contigent was somber: ``The outcome has certainly
not been entirely to our satisfaction,'' said Dawson.
   The panel must now prepare a written summary of its comments for
the EPA staff, to serve as the underpinnings of a final version of
the passive-smoking report.
   Agency scientists said it is now almost certain the final report
will retain the conclusion that passive smoking causes lung cancer.
But the tobacco industry isn't finished.
   ``I'm not willing to concede that this is over yet,'' said
Dawson.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell in thin pre-holiday trading
Monday on pessimism over heightened Middle East war talk.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dropped 25-32 point, or
$7.81 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when the
price falls, rose to 8.35 percent from 8.29 percent late Friday.
   Market analysts said increasing war talk over the weekend from
U.S. and Iraqi officials sent down the price of the key bond at the
start of trading.
   Before concluding a visit to the gulf region, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said the ``clock is ticking'' toward war with Iraq.
Cheney declined to say whether the United States has a timetable to
attack Iraqi forces if Saddam Hussein ignores a U.N.-imposed Jan.
15 deadline to leave Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, Saddam, Iraq's president, said Tel Aviv will be
Iraq's first target if war breaks out. It was the first time he had
threatened to make the Jewish state his first target.
   War in the Middle East likely would push up the price of oil, an
inflationary event that would erode the value of Treasury
securities.
   ``It is nothing more than a continuation of the war jitters we
saw (that) began to dominate trading last week,'' said William V.
Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Also, traders were selling to square their positions before the
end of the year and to avoid losses should the situation in the
Persian Gulf change on Christmas Day, when the nation's financial
markets are closed.
   Sullivan said trading was extremely light in an abbreviated
trading session.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities fell 3-32 point to 9-32 point, intermediate maturities
declined 11-16 point to 9-16 point and long-term issues were off by
up to 27-32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was down 4.54 to 1,177.45.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down to 6.72 percent
as the discount fell 1 basis point to 6.53 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 6.93 percent as the discount increased rose
2 basis points to 6.62 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to
6.98 percent as the discount gained 4 basis points to 6.55 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was trading at 7 percent, down from 7\ percent late Friday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 5-32, down &lsqb; point. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.48 percent from 7.47 percent late
Friday.

   Stock prices declined moderately Monday in
listless Christmas eve trading.
   Activity was sparse throughout the session, which closed for the
impending holiday at 2 p.m. EST, two hours earlier than usual.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.37 points to
2,621.29.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
527 up, 842 down and 560 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 57.20 million
shares, down from 233.40 million in the previous session and the
lightest total since 48.48 million were traded on Dec. 26, 1986.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 72.30 million shares.
   Analysts said traders took their cues from the bond market,
where interest rates rose.
   Prices of long-term government bonds dropped almost $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.35 percent-8.36
percent range.
   Buying interest in stocks also was muted by worries that the
situation in the Persian Gulf would inhibit any market rallies
heading into the early days of 1991.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down &rsqb; at 30\; Coca-Cola, down 1&lsqb; at 47&rsqb;; McDonald's,
down | at 28&rsqb;, and General Electric, down &rsqb; at 57|.
   Pan Am Corp. fell \ to 1\ in active trading amid uncertainty
about financing and legal arrangements that would clear the way for
Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, to acquire the
company.
   Carnival Cruise Lines, traded on the American Stock Exchange,
dropped } to 14&rsqb;. The company indicated that it would post flat to
lower earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Nov. 30.
   Bank stocks generally showed fractional losses. Manufacturers
Hanover, the most active Big Board issue, dropped &lsqb; to 23~;
BankAmerica &lsqb; to 27&rsqb;; Citicorp \ to 13\; Chemical Banking &lsqb; to 11\,
and J.P. Morgan &lsqb; to 46&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.21 billion, or 0.43
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .86 to 180.01.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.99 to 385.94, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.85 at 329.90.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.19 to 373.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 304.59, down 1.61.

<HEAD>Dollars, Dollars Everywhere Amid Ruble Confusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar is rapidly becoming the currency
of choice in the Soviet Union due to growing confusion over the
value of the ruble during the country's struggle to become a
market-driven economy.
   Rubles are worth nothing outside the Soviet Union because the
government refuses to back them with hard currency, gold or silver.
   But inside the country tourists can walk up to a Moscow hotel
currency booth and buy six rubles for one dollar, or 16 cents each.
If they use a credit card, they get 1.8 rubles for that same
dollar, the so-called commercial rate.
   On the black market, a dollar fetches about 20 rubles.
   ``Confusion reigns everywhere,'' said Andy Rafalat, deputy
general director of Moscow's two Pizza Hut restaurants.
   More and more firms have been switching as many transactions as
possible to hard currencies, the favorite being the U.S. dollar.
   Leaders of the huge Russian republic, who want to make the ruble
the only legal currency in the country, have coined a word for the
trend: ``dollarization.''
   Barter deals - from PepsiCo's vodka-for-oil tankers deal to
using the instantly recognizable red-and-white Marlboro cigarette
package to flag a cab - are also becoming more popular.
   Until recently, foreign businesses had dealt in the official or
``hard'' ruble known in Russian as ``valuta.'' Their price tags and
restaurant menus were printed in official rubles, but payable only
in hard currency or credit cards at the official rate.
   This rate was effectively replaced in November with a new
commercial exchange rate devaluing the ruble to 1.8 rubles to the
dollar from 1.6 rubles.
   In his decree, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated this
rate was to cover all international commercial transactions by
Soviet companies as well as joint ventures with foreign firms and
foreign residents in the Soviet Union.
   The official rate was retained only for international currency
comparisons and to protect Third World countries whose debts are in
rubles.
   Finland, the Soviet Union's closest Western trading partner, was
so confused that its central bank stopped clearing ruble
transactions for nearly one week.
   In Moscow, the Swiss-Soviet joint venture Sadko kept its staff
on overtime one night to change all its price tags. Ruble prices
were tripled, but since the new ruble was worth only one-third of
the old one, the hard currency price remained the same.
   Pizza Hut immediately started writing its credit card bills in
U.S. dollars to avoid any risk of customers being charged the
higher exchange rate by banks ignoring the new rules.
   Explanatory notes have been stapled to all hard currency menus
and Rafalat said the company is considering reprinting them in
dollars instead of rubles next month to make them easier to
understand.
   ``We were quite happy to use the hard ruble rate, but only if
there's an acceptable, clear definition for our business use, which
at this moment hasn't been the case,'' he said in an interview.
   ``The only 100 percent clear road I can see is by quoting prices
in another currency. As we receive most of our hard currency in
dollars, dollars seem to be the most obvious thing to quote.''
   Stockmann, a Finnish firm with grocery and department stores in
Moscow, kept its price tags in the old official rubles and posted a
notice on its front door advising customers. But on Jan. 1 it will
close its two Moscow outlets to switch all prices and credit card
transactions to dollars.
   ``In this confusing situation, we find it better to change the
prices directly to dollars,'' store manager Ilkka Arvola said.
   ``These continuous questions and explanations between us and our
customers ... is completely unnecessary and customers do not like
this uneasy feeling. Neither do I,'' he said.
   ``Customers sort of think we might be cheating them somehow,
which we're not.''
   Switching to dollars should also prevent disruptions the next
time the ruble rate is changed, he said.
   Western diplomats and businessmen say the new rate is a
tentative step toward making the ruble convertible, as it inches
the Soviet currency closer to its real value.
   The Soviet government has given no firm indication when or how
it plans to make the ruble convertible.

<HEAD>Backlash Puts Brakes On Marketers' Green Machine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rarely has something so green made marketers so
blue.
   In the past year, manufacturers have crammed supermarket shelves
with everything from ``degradable'' plastic bags to
``ozone-friendly'' hair sprays in hopes of cashing in on the
growing concern about the environment.
   But the so-called Green Revolution, one of the most powerful
marketing machines since oat bran hit the dietary scene, is
grinding its gears. Lawsuits, legislative proposals and consumer
boycotts have led many companies to stop claiming broad
environmental benefits for their products.
   ``The major manufacturers have backpedaled because they are
leery of getting caught in making claims that through no fault of
their own they can't substantiate,'' said Robert McMath, a consumer
products expert and director of the New Products Showcase and
Learning Center in Ithaca, N.Y.
   Mobil Chemical Corp. said last spring it would refrain from
promoting its Hefty plastic bags as ``photo-degradable'' after
consumer and government groups complained the bags wouldn't degrade
anytime soon inside the darkened recesses of landfills, where most
trash ends up.
   Seven states subsequently sued Mobil this summer, saying the
company hasn't removed all of the existing products that still
contain those criticized claims.
   ``What's happened is that the Hefty incident has really made
manufacturers go back to square one,'' said Simon Williams,
president of Michael Peters Design, a New York consultant firm that
specializes in earth-friendly packaging.
   Retreats from biodegradable claims have since become widespread.
Following Mobil's announcement last spring, First Brands Corp., of
Danbury, Conn., and Webster Industries Inc., of Peabody, Mass.,
said they would also refrain from degradability claims for their
Glad and Good Sense plastic bags.
   American Enviro Products Inc., of Placentia, Calif., agreed to
stop promoting its Bunnies disposable diapers as biodegradable
after attorneys general in 10 states threatened to sue.
   More recently, Willamette Industries Inc., of Portland, Ore.,
one of the nation's largest paper bag manufacturers, eliminated the
words ``biodegradable'' and ``recyclable'' from the bottom of its
paper bags distributed at supermarket checkout counters in 17
Western states.
   Green Cross Certification Co., an independent certification firm
hired by Willamette, said most consumers will not recycle the
product and that the bags will take years to degrade in most
landfills.
   Willamette still hypes the bags' ``recycled'' content, but Green
Cross has verified it is composed of a minimum of 40 percent
recycled consumer paper.
   Seventh Generation, a Burlington, Vt.-based mail order firm
specializing in earth-friendly products, announced a new policy
regarding so-called degradable plastic bags in last spring's
catalog: ``We suspended sale of these bags because we are no longer
confident they are beneficial to the environment.''
   ``Large manufacturers feel somewhat caught between the need to
do something and the fear of figuring out the right thing to do
while avoiding adverse implications for their current product
line,'' said Jeffrey Hollender, chairman and chief executive
officer of Seventh Generation.
   To be fair, the green flood has hardly subsided - the number of
new products hyping their ecological soundness nearly tripled this
year to 751, according to Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd., a
research firm in Naples, N.Y.
   But product consultants say they expect fewer new claims next
year, and they expect more of them to be of the provable kind.
   Critics say their next area of attack are supposedly
earth-friendly aerosols whose ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons
have been replaced by other suspect chemicals. The biggest new
growth area are household products, ranging from paints to
cleaners.
   ``We've got to make sure consumers are not going to feel that
every ad and every bit of labeling is to be disregarded because it
is false and deceptive,'' said New York State Attorney General
Robert Abrams in a telephone interview en route from his Albany
office.
   Indeed, state officials praised a recent move by Proctor &amp;
Gamble Co. to offer waste-efficient ``refillable'' containers for
its Downy fabric softener.
   Early this month at hearings in San Diego, a group of state
attorneys general proposed nationwide minimum standards for
environmental claims consistent with national and state legislation
currently in draft form.
   They also called for reduced use of general, hard-to-document
terms like ``environmentally friendly.'' Instead, manufacturers are
urged to be as detailed as possible when describing claims like
``recycled content,'' telling precisely what percentage of the
content is recycled.
   States including New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota and
Texas are pressing for legislation that would bar manufacturers
from using ``degradable'' on packages before more research is
available on just how long it takes these products to decompose. A
New York bill failed to win approval this session.
   ``For the first year there was no guidance,'' said Linda Brown,
a spokeswoman at Green Cross, which is based in Oakland, Calif.
``Now companies are taking a closer look to see if any of these
claims are falling into gray zones.''

<HEAD>FCC Approves Spinoff of WWOR As Part of MCA Sale to Matsushita</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission said
Monday it had approved the transfer of a New York-area television
station from MCA Inc. to MCA shareholders, removing a barrier to
the sale of MCA to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan.
   Under federal law, Matsushita as a foreign corporation is barred
from owning MCA's WWOR-TV, based in Secaucus, N.J.
   The station will be spun off to MCA shareholders in the form of
a separate company.
   Under the FCC's decision, entertainment giant MCA will be
allowed to complete the divestiture on condition that three MCA
officials resign their positions either with MCA or its subsidiary
MCA Broadcasting Inc. and WWOR.
   MCA officials were not available for comment because the company
was closed for the Christmas holiday, said a guard at MCA's
headquarters in Universal City, Calif.
   Matsushita, a huge conglomerate known in the United States for
its names Panasonic, Technics and Quasar brands, agreed last month
to acquie MCA, parent of Universal Studios, for $6.6 billion, the
largest purchase of a U.S. company by one in Japan.
   In addition to its motion picture business, MCA also owns book
publishing and music publishing assets, retail and mail order
businesses, food and lodging concessions at Yosemite National Park,
49 percent of Cineplex Odeon theaters and 50 percent of the USA
cable TV network.
   To deflect criticism of foreign ownership of an interest in
Yosemite, Matsushita has said that MCA's Curry Co. subsidiary,
which operates restaurants, hotels and other services in the
national park, will be sold within a year. Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan has said the federal government itself may want to
acquire the services.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise on Exports, Weather Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose moderately Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade in a late rally linked to new export sales and fears of
weather damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Oat futures also advanced while corn and soybean futures ended
mostly lower on light volume in a shortened Christmas Eve trading
session.
   Most cattle futures rose and pork futures finished mostly lower
in a shortened session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Other
U.S. commodity markets were closed.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $2.64\ a bushel; corn was 1\
cents lower to { cent higher with March at $2.33\ a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $1.12{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 1\ cents higher with January at
$5.62\ a bushel.
   Wheat futures drew some support from news of
government-subsidized sales of U.S. wheat to Colombia, Yemen and
Sri Lanka, analysts said.
   The rally also reflected speculation about possible damage to
the winter wheat crop after nearly a week of record-breaking frigid
weather in the Great Plains, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant
vice president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``A lot of winter wheat areas don't have adequate snow coverage,
which could increase winterkill if this weather continues - and it
looks like it's going to for several days,'' he said.
   Corn and soybean prices were pressured by fears that political
changes in the Soviet Union could lead to civil unrest, a military
crackdown and a cutoff in U.S. food aid, he said.
   Cattle futures posted modest gains in light trading amid
perceptions that beef consumption will increase with retail
promotions after the holidays.
   Near-term pork futures ended lower on pre-holiday profit taking
and ideas that hog marketings could rise sharply when the cold
weather eases in the Midwest, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
February at 76.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .20
cent higher with January at 88.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 48.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .42 cent to .62 cent lower with February
at 64.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Report: Northwest Airlines Near Deal to Operate Pan Am Shuttle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has arranged for a
Portland, Ore., utility to buy the Pan Am Shuttle and allow
Northwest to operate the shuttle with an option to buy, according
to a published report Monday.
   Northwest would not comment on the report in The Wall Street
Journal. The newspaper said PacifiCorp would buy the Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle for about $150 million.
   ``We can't comment on that as to whether we are in negotiations
or struck a deal,'' said Doug Miller, a spokesman for Northwest,
the nation's fourth largest airline. ``There's no announcement to
make and we don't have any comment on it.''
   PacifiCorp and New York-based Pan Am also declined to comment.
   PacifiCorp is the third largest utility in the West, holding
Pacific Power of Portland and Utah Power of Salt Lake City. A
subsidiary, PacifiCorp Financial Services Inc., has $1.7 billion in
assets and has interests in 50 aircraft. It reported a 1989
aviation finance portfolio of $244 million, spokeswoman Caroline
Petrich said.
   PacifiCorp Finance Inc., a subsidiary of PacifiCorp Financial
Services Inc., took preliminary steps nearly two years ago to
acquire HAL Inc., the parent of Hawaiian Airlines. The deal never
was completed.
   Marc Robins, an analyst who follows PacifiCorp for Capital
Consultants Inc. of Portland, said he was unaware of the
PacifiCorp-Northwest-Pan Am deal. But he said it sounded like a
good opportunity for PacifiCorp Financial Services.
   The Portland company's interest likely would remain purely
financial, he said. PacifiCorp executives probably are not
interested in running an airline, Robins said.
   The Journal, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the
arrangement, said union leaders were told this month that a sale
was imminent but later were told it had been delayed.
   Leaders at three Pan Am unions could not be reached for comment.
No one answered phones in their offices.
   Guy Cook, head of the largest union at Northwest, said he knew
nothing about the reported deal. But he said such an acquisition
could make sense for Northwest.
   ``I've heard a lot of rumors about an East Coast shuttle,'' said
Cook, president of the International Association of Machinists
District Lodge 143. ``I knew there was an interest and from a
shuttle standpoint for Northwest there would be no problem.''
   Cook said Northwest might be able to run the shuttle without
adding a lot of workers because it already has bases in New York,
Boston and Washington. He speculated that Pan Am could use the cash
from a shuttle sale to stay afloat and clear the way for a proposed
buyout by Trans World Airlines Inc.
   Henry ``Pete'' Dodge, chairman of the Northwest Airlines chapter
of the Air Line Pilots Association, said he probably would have
been informed by Northwest Chairman Al Checchi if such a deal for
the shuttle were imminent.
   Dodge said he had no knowledge that a transaction was in the
works, but said he would welcome such a move.
   ``It doesn't totally surprise me,'' Dodge said. ``Anything to
help strengthen our domestic market certainly can't hurt.''
   Checchi, who led a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest last year,
repeatedly has said he wants to expand his airline through
acquisitions. He had expressed interest in the former Eastern
Airlines' Boston-New York-Washington shuttle before it was sold
last year to Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Northwest has hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Memphis.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc, Reuters Announce Globex Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and Reuters Holdings PLC on Monday announced a
tentative agreement on Globex, their proposed electronic futures
and options trading system.
   The parties said they reached agreement on a letter of intent
that ``resolves all substantive issues toward the completion of a
20-year contract.''
   The letter of intent is subject to execution of a final
agreement, approval by the parties' governing boards and
ratification by the exchanges' members, according to a statement.
   The long-delayed system is scheduled for testing in Chicago, New
York and London around the end of the first quarter, the parties
said.
   Globex is envisioned as a worldwide, computerized system for
trading the financial futures and options products of various
exchanges when their trading floors are closed. Reuters would
supply the computer terminals and the technology.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange of
Australia and the French futures exchange known as MATIF have
agreed to offer products for trading on Globex alongside selected
products from the Merc and the Board of Trade.
   The Merc and London-based Reuters had announced plans for Globex
in September 1987 and originally hoped to have the system in
operation by the spring of 1989.
   The project was delayed by international regulatory hurdles and
negotiations with the Board of Trade, which agreed to join the
project last May after abandoning an attempt to create a competing
system.

<HEAD>Tobacco Company Says It Won't Appeal New Jersey Cigarette Suit
Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. will not
appeal a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that health warnings on
cigarette packs do not protect tobacco companies from liability
suits, the firm said Monday.
   In a statement, Louisville, Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson said it
is confident it would win if any liability cases are presented and
would not ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the New Jersey
decision.
   The New Jersey ruling flew in the face of a series of federal
decisions that gave tobacco companies immunity from smoker-death
lawsuits after 1966, when Congress ordered the labels placed on
cigarette packs.
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Claire Dewey of
Wyckoff in 1982. Her husband, Wilfred Dewey, had died a year before
on his 50th birthday from lung cancer after smoking for more than
40 years.
   The court decision said Mrs. Dewey had the right to sue.
   In its statement, Brown &amp; Williamson said it is ``confident
that, if there is a trial on the merits of the Dewey case, the
company will prevail.''
   The company said the New Jersey case is ``clearly contrary to
all previous and subsequent federal court of appeals and state
Supreme Court determinations. Review of the New Jersey Supreme
Court decision may either not be necessary or be more appropriate
after the Dewey case is concluded at the trial stage.''
   Telephone calls placed to the two other tobacco companies
included in the Dewey suit - RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. and American
Brands - were not answered Monday.
   Marc Edell, the attorney who represents Mrs. Dewey, was out of
town and not available for comment Monday, his office said.

   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - Freezing temperatures have devastated

   Dave Carman of the National Weather Service called the weather
probably the second-coldest freeze of the century.
   Temperatures throughout the San Joaquin Valley citrus region
dipped below 20 degrees from Friday night through Sunday night.
   Navel oranges begin to show damage if the temperature falls to
25 or 26 degrees and stays at that level or below for at least four
hours, said Cliff Holland of California Citrus Mutual, a grower
organization.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - As a gathering recession compels many

new levies will drive up the price of some cars by thousands of
