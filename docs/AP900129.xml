<HEAD>Carter Hopes For Honest Elections In Nicaragua</HEAD>

   Former President Carter, an official observer of
next month's elections in Nicaragua, said Monday he's confident the
voting will be fair and honest.
   ``I think it's going to be, relatively speaking, a superb
election,'' Carter, just back from that Central American country,
told a national security symposium at the Carter Presidential
Center.
   ``What is protecting the integrity of the election is that both
sides believe they are going to win,'' he said, referring to the
Sandinista government and the opposition.
   Carter has been invited to observe the general elections, along
with representatives of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of
Government, a group of former chief executives which Carter heads.
   Carter returned from a trip to Nicaragua Sunday night.
   ``We're doing everything we can to ensure that technically the
election is almost perfect,'' he said Monday.
   The Sandinistas have been cooperative, realizing they will not
look good if Carter and other international observers brand the
elections as fixed.
   The former president expressed the hope that the trend toward
free elections might spread to Cambodia, Afghanistan and other
troubled nations.
   ``This is the kind of approach that can be a new evolution in
addressing long-standing armed conflict in troubled parts of the
world,'' Carter said.
   Carter also said that with pro-democracy movements around the
world, the United States has an important opportunity ``to use
these tremendous resources we have been wasting on weapons _ and
sometimes spending wisely on weapons _ for other purposes.''
   He said the defense budget could be halved within a decade,
leaving an adequate military coupled with national security based
on friendship and cooperation between nations.
   ``Will we do it?'' he asked. ``I don't know. ... It might take
us a year or two to realize we have this opportunity, but such
wonderful things can be done.''

   Striking hotel workers briefly closed the main
streeet downtown Monday night in a noisy sit-in that ended with
police arresting 74 of the demonstrators.
   The strikers linked arms and sat in a circle in the middle of
glittering Fremont Street between the Golden Nugget and Binion's
Horseshoe Club, where union workers walked off the job Saturday
after working without a contract for eight months.
   About 30 police officers confronted the strikers and, after they
refused to disband, began arresting them one by one. There was no
violence and the demonstration was over in 30 minutes.
   Culinary Union Local 226 leader Jim Arnold was among those put
in plastic handcuffs and taken to a waiting police bus for
transportation to the Clark County Detention Center.
   Metropolitan Police Lt. Randy Oaks said the strikers arrested
would be booked on misdemeanor public nuisance charges.
   Union officials said they had made arrangements to bail strikers
out.
   Pickets marching in front of the Horseshoe Club chanted slogans
in support of the strikers in the street, as curious tourists
sipped drinks and watched the action from the other side of the
street.
   The strike was the first by the Culinary and Bartenders' unions
since 1984, when a walkout against most of the city's resorts cost
millions of dollars in lost revenue and resulted in nearly 1,000
arrests.
   Arnold, secretary-treasurer of Local 226, said he had heard
nothing from Binion's president Jack Binion since the strike began.
Arnold accused Binion of trying to break the union at the resort.
   ``We knew it could be a long one and we're prepared for it,''
Arnold said of the walkout.
   Union officials said 90 percent of the 1,100 kitchen workers,
bartenders, porters and other union members walked off their jobs,
but an attorney for the Horseshoe said half the workers were
crossing picket lines.
   The casino is the first to be struck since union contracts
expired June 1.
   The Horseshoe is one of 14 resorts that have not reached new
pacts with the union, but 20 resorts, including most major casinos
along the Strip a couple of miles from downtown, agreed several
months ago to five-year pacts.

   Phil Donahue's audience took turns blasting
General Motors Corp. and filmmaker Michael Moore on Monday as they
discussed the quirky documentary ``Roger and Me.''
   About 2,000 people jammed Whiting Auditorium for a segment of
Donahue's nationally syndicated television show devoted to Moore's
film.
   The crowd included auto workers, who accused GM of sending
American jobs overseas, and Flint boosters, who said Moore's movie
made conditions in Flint look worse than they are.
   ``You showed the slummiest areas,'' one woman told Moore.
   ``Roger and Me'' purports to depict what happened to Flint when
GM shut down factories in the community, idling 30,000 workers over
several years.
   In the film, Moore unsuccessfully pursues GM Chairman Roger
Smith to ask him to come to Flint to see what GM's layoffs have
done to the city.
   The documentary, made for $260,000 and released nationwide by
Warner Brothers this month, has won several awards and is being
touted as a possible Academy Award winner for best documentary. But
Moore has come under fire by some film critics for misrepresenting
some time sequences, such as the span during which layoffs occurred.
   Moore, a Flint native, said his movie's message was that ``after
10 years of Reagan and Bush, it's not morning in America for us.
We're all working harder for less.''
   Moore said GM has a responsibility to the community where it got
it started.
   ``The American dream used to be you work hard, the company
prospers, you prosper. Now, you work hard, the company prospers,
you lose your job,'' he said, noting that the layoffs came when GM
still was making millions a year in profits.
   GM critics accused Smith of earning millions for himself, while
workers were losing their jobs. ``While Roger Smith was pocketing
this money we were standing in line for moldy cheese,'' said one
woman.
   Donahue was scheduled to do a single one-hour show Monday, but
decided to tape a second show immediately after the first, because
many in the crowd had yet to be heard after showing up before dawn
Monday for the 4 p.m. show.
   Donahue said GM declined to send anybody to appear with Moore.
   ``We are not interested in doing anything that might help
promote a film that is inaccurate and totally unfair to the city of
Flint and the thousands of dedicated GM employees working there,''
according to a GM statement read by Donahue.
   The company also asked its dealers not to advertise during the
Donahue show about the film, Donahue said.
   Moore and many in the audience objected to Donahue's suggestion
that GM workers were to blame for the company's loss of market
share and their jobs.
   ``You made a lot of lousy cars,'' Donahue said.
   But Moore contended the company refused to listen to consumers
and focused on making cars cheaper.
   Moore was booed when he admitted to owning a Honda Civic, but
said that even some so-called American-made cars are built with
many foreign made parts.
   The show was shown live to about 40 cities and will be shown
Tuesday in more than 150 others.

<HEAD>The British Bobbie: Scandals Tarnish His Cherished Image</HEAD>

   Times aren't good for the British bobby, the
policeman so admired and respected he never needed to carry a gun.
   With disturbing regularity these days, his image is being
tarnished by scandals that range from evidence-rigging to falsified
crime-busting rates.
   The scandals have triggered alarm about the integrity of the
nation's 146,000-member police force, and prompted some highly
public soul-searching by senior officers.
   Until recently, the criticism came chiefly from left-wingers
whom the police could dismiss as chronic malcontents. Where corrupt
officers were exposed, they were portrayed as the few ``bad
apples'' in a fundamentally healthy barrel.
   Britons who follow the police developments closely say it is not
the level of abuses that has increased, but the public's awareness
of them. The criticism is coming increasingly from opinion makers,
who say the ``bad apple'' excuse is no longer good enough.
   ``If the public's confidence in the police is lost, I cannot see
how it can be regained,'' columnist Bernard Levin wrote in The
Times. ``And if it is not regained, the damage to our entire way of
life would be immense, so vital is the need for a force which can
be relied upon.''
   A public opinion poll published in November indicated the police
are held in esteem by only 43 percent of Britons now in contast to
83 percent in 1959.
   The worst case of what The Independent newspaper calls
``institutional rot'' occurred in October when the Court of Appeal
freed four people serving life terms for bombing British pubs
during a 1974 wave of Irish Republican Army attacks. The court
quashed the conviction of the ``Guildford Four'' after seeing
evidence that police from the Surry county force falsified records
and lied in court to strengthen their case.
   Civil libertarians are pressing to reopen other IRA convictions,
notably the jailing of six Irishmen for a 1974 pub bombing in
Birmingham, in central England, which killed 21 people. The six
claim they are innocent and were beaten into confessing.
   In December, a court ordered Scotland Yard in London to pay a
record 100,000 pounds ($165,000) in damages to a black man falsely
accused of carrying illicit drugs. It was one of a series of cases
from 1984-85 in which police in the Notting Hill district of west
London were accused of planting drugs on blacks.
   In September, investigators found that police in Kent had
increased crime-detection rates by pressing convicted prisoners to
confess falsely to extra crimes. It led to the dismissal of a
detective sergeant and heavy fines for six of his colleagues.
   Public opinion was further inflamed by news that the policeman
who exposed the corruption was being cold-shouldered by his
colleagues and was threatened with dismissal when he demanded a
transfer.
   The British force is divided into 52 constabularies, mostly on
county lines, and usually officers from one county are called in to
investigate suspected abuses by another.
   Commented The Independent: ``At the moment, with half a dozen of
our major forces investigating one another, the police are in
danger of running out of investigators to investigate the
investigators.''
   Signs of a dramatic new approach came in August, when Chief
Constable Geoffrey Dear of the West Midlands force took the unusual
step of dismantling his entire serious-crime squad over allegations
of fabricated confessions and doctored evidence. More than 50
officers were sidelined.
   Dear got what appeared to be crucial backing a month later from
Sir Peter Imbert, commissioner of Scotland Yard, in a watershed
speech to a police conference.
   ``Sometimes it must seem that we set out deliberately to
frustrate the inquirer, and in doing so we manage to turn a
grievance into a crusade,'' he said. Police reticence, he added,
carried ``quiet but strong implications of corruption.''
   The scope of abuses is expected to narrow sharply with the new
Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which requires interrogators to
record every word said in the room and hold no one for more than 36
hours without court authorization and access to a lawyer. By 1991
all interrogations will have to be tape-recorded.
   That law already has led to hundreds of detectives requesting
transfers on grounds that they could not cope with the exacting new
procedures, said Barry Irving, director of the Police Foundation,
an independent research group.
   Scotland Yard's Imbert urges more emphasis on old-style policing
based on close consultation with local communities, especially
ethnic groups.
   ``The public have a right to be actively involved in determining
how policing is developed,'' he said in his September speech.
   P.A.J. Waddington, a Reading University expert on police, says
that ``policing is inherently scandal-prone. What seems to vary is
the extent to which people perceive problems as being scandals.''
   Waddington said in an interview that police malpractice is
``substantially less than at any time in our history,'' and the
fact that police violence still makes headlines demonstrates that
it is still regarded as an unusual phenomenon.
   But in recent times, the old image of the friendly neighborhood
bobby has been supplanted by a new breed, hardened by inner-city
riots in the early 1980s and frequent picket line violence.
   Criminologist Robert Reiner of the London School of Economics
thinks the accumulation of gross abuses ``is extremely disturbing,
but I don't think it's a sign the police have gone bad.''
   The police are doing their job as they always did, he said in an
interview. The difference is that the public perception of them has
changed.
   ``There is a crisis in the public legitimacy of the British
police,'' he said.

   On the corner of Dr. David Page's desk
rests a foot-high stack of newly published genetics textbooks. They
matter-of-factly describe the location of the sex-determining
factor, the single gene that settles the question of whether a
fertilized egg will be a boy or a girl.
   The gene was Page's discovery. Its rapid rise to the status of
accepted wisdom is hardly a surprise, for when he revealed it at a
news conference, the announcement was a major event in the world of
genetics.
   Isolating the gene was a milestone in basic biology, the prize
in an exhausting race and the kind of achievement on which
distinguished careers are built, clearly a breakthrough in a field
that uses the word sparingly.
   Or so it seemed.
   The story was simple: One tiny bit of genetic code rules gender.
If we have it at the moment we are conceived, we will be male. If
not, we'll be female.
   Just two years after Page's announcement, the precise location
of the sex-determining factor is a mystery again. The gene he
found, while interesting and probably important, is almost
certainly not it.
   The case illustrates the skittish and often whimsical way
science moves. Rather than flowing forward in a neat, sane way,
facts _ and theories cobbled together to fit them _ emerge in a
jerky tango of discovery and setback. A new set of lab results can
turn breathtaking insight to smoke.
   Page is a staff scientist at the Whitehead Institute, an elite
center for genetics research across the street from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. While still in training at MIT, he used to
smile at a cartoon on a biology professor's door: ``Theory, like
mist on eyeglasses, obscures vision.''
   Page's theory, accepted by many, is now in shambles. But it's
not the first time people have been wrong about the location of the
sex-determining factor. A decade ago, many believed it was a gene
called H-Y, and some textbooks still state this unequivocally.
   Page's quest to find the sex switch began in 1982. Like others,
he tried to track it down by a process of elimination.
   Everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes.
Two of these, called X and Y, are the sex chromosomes. Women have
two X's, while men have an X and a Y. Scientists reason that the
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace
on the Y.
   Page and others have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the
rule, so-called XX males. To all outward appearances, these people
are physically normal men. But their cells contain the double X's
of women. Through a genetic mix-up, one of their X's contains a
tiny fragment of Y, enough to make them men.
   Among those he studied was an XX man with just half of 1 percent
of a Y chromosome. Within this bit of DNA he found a gene that was
shared by other XX males. He postulated this was TDF,
testis-determining factor _ the sex switch.
   His description of the gene and his idea of what it did were
published in December 1987 in the journal Cell. It was a depressing
moment for Dr. Peter N. Goodfellow at the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund in London, whose team was just a few months from making the
same discovery.
   Page was almost certain he had correctly identified TDF, but
remembers feeling uneasy when colleagues flashed slides during
lectures that confidently called it that. ``You try as hard as you
can to say that something is a working hypothesis, and it gets
boiled down, even in a textbook, to established fact.''
   To be on the safe side, he named his gene ZFY, or Y-linked zinc
finger protein, a reference to the kind of chemical structure it
makes. Then he and other scientists searched for evidence that ZFY
is TDF. But when new pieces of the puzzle emerged, they didn't
quite fit.
   ``If you get something that is right, more and more things start
clicking into place,'' said Goodfellow. ``What happened with the
ZFY story is that it didn't get stronger and stronger.''
   Among the conflicting details:
   _Page knew from the start that there was a related gene on the X
chromosome. But when its structure was decoded, it was
disquietingly like ZFY. If ZFY is uniquely male, why would females
have a very similar gene?
   _All mammals have their own version of ZFY. But among the
marsupials, such as kangaroos, the gene isn't on the Y chromosome
at all; it lies on one of the non-sex chromosomes that presumably
has nothing to do with sex determination.
   _Other XX males turned up who did not carry ZFY.
   _In mouse embryos, the gene did not seem to be doing anything at
the time when sex is determined.
   _Efforts to transplant ZFY into female embryos didn't produce
male mice.
   Alone, any of these tidbits could be explained away. Maybe the
male mouse embryos weren't producing the ZFY protein because
scientists were looking for it after the gene had already turned
itself on and off. Maybe marsupials and their distant relatives
among placental mammals have simply evolved different means of sex
determination. Together, though, the tidbits raised doubts.
   ``As the data accumulated, it seemed to be more and more
puzzling how it could be the sex-determining gene,'' said Benajmin
Lewin, editor of Cell. ``That is quite a common situation. One sees
an assumption, a model is proposed, and then more data accumulate
that are not consistent with the model, and then the model breaks.''
   The breaking point for this model came with a paper in December
in the journal Nature. Goodfellow had found four XX males who
carried a bit of the Y chromosome, but not the part with ZFY on it.
He argued that somewhere in the fragment they shared was the true
sex-determining factor.
   While Page was unmoved by the earlier skepticism over ZFY,
Goodfellow's discovery was a shock. ``It hit me, sure, in part
because I did not know this was coming until it was published.'' He
could dismiss the other evidence as circumstantial, but Goodfellow
had used precisely the same line of reasoning to attack ZFY's role
as Page had used to support it.
   ``This makes it clear that ZFY is not the only sex-determining
function on the Y,'' Page said. ``It's possible that ZFY has
little, if anything, to do with sex determination.''
   Goodfellow isn't gloating. If he had found ZFY first, he said,
he would have written the paper Page wrote. ``A lot of people have
said to me, `It shows that David Page got it wrong.' Everyone likes
to see a hero fall.
   ``It's not really like that. Yes, his interpretation was
incorrect. But if you go back and look at it, he put forward what
seemed to be the best hypothesis at the time.''
   Now Goodfellow and Page are back where they were, competing to
find the sex trigger gene.
   ``I'm not in the position of wanting to stand up and crow,''
Goodfellow said. ``We are testing the most likely hypothesis. That
may be wrong, or maybe David will publish finding a gene in this
region tomorrow.''

<HEAD>Labor Strife, Competition Dim Prospects for Port of Baltimore</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once an economic power that drew ships from
around the world to its piers at the head of the Chesapeake Bay,
the Port of Baltimore is losing ground to its competitors and its
reputation for labor troubles.
   Even the unexpectedly quick settlement of a three-day
dockworkers' strike last week failed to appreciably brighten
prospects for the $1 billion complex.
   ``Even a three-day walkout has reverberations. It's like the
shot heard round the world _ Baltimore goes out again,'' said state
Delegate Eileen Rehrmann. ``It sends a message all over the world
that we're unreliable.''
   The Jan. 19 strike by about 2,000 members of the International
Longshoremen's Association stranded cargo containers on piers and
prompted about a dozen vessels to divert to competing waterfronts,
officials said.
   The dockworkers, who struck over jurisdiction of clerical jobs,
went back to work Tuesday and ratified a new contract that gave up
60 of those jobs.
   Yet it may be more significant that the union gave up its ``rain
clause,'' a local work rule blamed for higher labor costs. The new
contract lets managers, instead of the union, decide when weather
is too hazardous to work.
   U.S. Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., who acted as a mediator in the
contract dispute, said eliminating the rain clause alone would save
steamship lines about $2.5 million a year.
   ``The damage has already been done, internationally and within
our own state,'' said Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who had
threatened a state takeover of the port's operations long before
last week's strike.
   Schaefer returned from European and Middle East trade missions
last year complaining about the port's labor image abroad, and for
years has complained of lagging modernization to keep up with the
boom in containerized shipping.
   Richard Hughes, head of the ILA local representing clerical
workers, contends that the port should control its administrative
costs _ eliminating such things as executive bonuses _ and make its
rates more competitive with regional competitors.
   Hughes, whose jurisdictional complaint led to the three-day
strike, said he doesn't consider the contract satisfactory, raising
the possibility of another wrangle when the pact expires in
November.
   ILA District President Horace Alston, who heads the five ILA
locals working in the Port of Baltimore, didn't return a phone call.
   Baltimore, a 12-hour sail up the bay from the Atlantic Ocean,
once was insulated from hard times by its position as the harbor
closest to the nation's industrial heartland.
   Freight deregulation in the 1970s turned that into a liability,
with customers shopping for competitive truck and rail rates from
ports that huge steamships could reach more conveniently.
   In the mid-1980s, the port authority began to step into labor
negotiations between the ILA and dock employers, represented by the
Steamship Trade Association.
   Port officials were anxious to obtain union concessions to
improve the port's reputation for reliability and lower its costs.
But that only strained relations between the ILA and the employers,
who lease the docks and hire from the labor pool.
   Richard Trainor, head of the Maryland Port Commission, said the
economic effect of the strike goes far beyond the 2,000 or so ILA
members.
   He estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people make a living from the
port's business. Even that is far less than what used to be. Ten
years ago, a state study found the port directly or indirectly
supported more than 100,000 people.
   Port of Baltimore officials say 28 ship lines have folded,
merged or deserted Baltimore in the past five years.
   While shipping volume has declined worldwide, Baltimore's market
share has been sapped by other Atlantic seaboard ports, especially
Virginia's Hampton Roads complex at Norfolk.
   Port of Baltimore figures show that between 1982 and 1988, its
share of Midwest-bound freight dwindled from 18 percent to 10
percent while Norfolk's climbed from 6 percent to 9 percent.
   Baltimore's Mid-Atlantic share went from 30 percent to 20
percent while Norfolk's rose from 13 percent to 18 percent.
   The Sun in Baltimore reported Thursday that last year, for the
first time, Virginia ports probably surpassed Baltimore in the
amount of general cargo handled.
   Maryland port officials said their 1989 numbers weren't yet
prepared for publication, but figures through September show a 6.4
percent drop in general cargo from the year before.
   Trainor said the port must become more financially attractive to
shippers.
   ``If you're in business selling something for $1 and everybody
else is selling it for 50 cents, you might as well make up your
mind you're in the wrong business, because the public is going to
make it up for you,'' he said.

   The opposition coalition is suffering
widespread losses even before Feb. 25 elections: at least 150 of
its municipal candidates and three National Assembly candidates
have quit the campaign in recent months.
   Officials of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, or UNO, say some
of those who withdrew were secret Sandinista sympathizers who
infiltrated UNO to embarrass it.
   But many others were taken in by a campaign of the ruling
Sandinistas that includes intimidation and warnings of a return to
the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, UNO says.
   For Olivia Bermudez, who quit her local race in December, ``the
Contra connection'' was the last straw.
   Mrs. Bermudez ended up accepting Sandinista accusations that her
own opposition coalition was linked to U.S.-supported Contra
guerrillas and might bring back the days of Somoza, who was
overthrown in 1979.
   ``Return to the past? Never!'' said Mrs. Bermudez, sitting in a
rocking chair on the front porch of her modest cement home, her
1-year-old baby on her lap.
   Mrs. Bermudez, 40, is a homemaker, mother of 10 and owner of a
couple of farms in the central province of Chontales.
   This is the cool, lush heartland of Nicaragua's cattle region
``where the rivers are made of milk and the stones of cheese,'' as
a local saying has it.
   It is also Contra territory. The Contras have the sympathy of
many local cattlemen and small farmers who don't like anyone
butting into their business, seizing their land or forcing them to
join co-ops.
   Raul Bello Cordero, 50, withdrew in mid-January as town council
candidate for Esquipulas, a village in north-central Matagalpa
province. He said two local Sandinista party officials threatened
to have his house and truck confiscated if he didn't resign.
   ``They said the Front (the Sandinistas) has already won the
elections, so if I didn't want to lose my property and have my
family affected I should resign,'' Bello said.
   Another threat, said Bello, was that his son would be drafted,
although the draft has been suspended at least for the duration of
the campaign.
   The Sandinistas deny intimidation, saying the candidates quit
after seeing that UNO is the ``civilian arm'' of the Contras. It's
a teme the Sandinistas have hammered at in their campaign.
   One staunchly pro-government newspaper, El Nuevo Diario,
regularly refers to UNO as ``GN-1.'' GN are the Spanish initials
for National Guard, as the generally hated army was called under
Somoza, and UNO means ``one'' in Spanish.
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking another six-year term,
constantly calls UNO and the Contras ``the Somocista Guard.'' He is
running for the Sandinista National Liberation Front against UNO's
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper
La Prensa.
   UNO does indeed include former members of the Contra resistance,
but they say the Sandinista attacks are unfair because they have
given up arms and agreed to join the political process.
   Mrs. Bermudez, who quit her town council race in mid-December,
said the coalition has been hampered by constant bickering among
its disparate parties that joined forces for the sole purpose of
beating the Sandinistas.
   She said it also suffers from a lack of money for campaign
activities.
   ``Let's face it: Nobody is in a position nowadays to shell out
money from their own pockets,'' said Mrs. Bermudez. The opposition
has said the Sandinista-controlled bureaucracy is blocking
distribution of its election funds.
   Candido Moreno Salgado, 40, said he quit a National Assembly
race after men who identified themselves as state security agents
visited his home and threatened to have his ranch confiscated
unless he resigned.
   Moreno, from the Matagalpa town of Dario, said the ultimatum was
preceded by telephoned death threats.
   Julio Cesar Fletes of the Atlantic Coast town of Bluefields, a
candidate for the regional council in his area, said he was
pressured by military and state security authorities.
   Fletes said he was given a jar of a black substance and told to
add it to food served at a UNO gathering. He said he was told the
substance was poison, and he refused to comply.
   He has remained a candidate, though he has fled to Managua.
   Hernaldo Zuniga, head of a Conservative Party faction within
UNO, said 40 cases of alleged intimidation had been presented to
the Supreme Electoral Council, but no reply had been received.
   Zuniga said many of those who withdrew because of threats
preferred to keep a low profile and would not complain.

   The following is the text of questions submitted
to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and his written
answers in advance of a face-to-face interview with The Associated
Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: The Bush Administration has been in place for a year now. Its
long policy review has been completed, and presidents Bush and
Gorbachev have held their first summit meeting. How would you
describe the state of U.S.-Soviet relations and superpower efforts
to solve regional conflicts?
   A: I believe that in analyzing Soviet-U.S. relations we can, on
the whole, look with satisfaction back to the past year. And the
prospects, too, seem to be favorable.
   It has been possible not only to maintain the positive momentum
in the development of relations between our two countries, but also
to elevate them to a new dimension. Both sides agree that having
renounced the spirit of confrontation and achieved certain mutual
understanding we must now move on to mutual action.
   This need arises virtually in all spheres of Soviet-U.S.
relations, not in the last instance _ in the area of solving
regional conflicts that you have mentioned.
   We have seen some tangible improvements here, although
difficulties persist, too.
   The successes of the past year, to be credited also to
Soviet-U.S. contacts, include the settlement in Southwest Africa
and the achievement of independence by Namibia.
   The machinery to promote a Cambodian settlement is shifting into
higher gear. It seems we can now see the light at the end of the
tunnel there.
   We keep constantly in sight the problems of the Middle East. It
is important that Israel, too, should take advantage of the
opportunities that are there.
   A political settlement in Afghanistan is literally knocking on
the door. Reliance on military force has outlived itself.
   The peace process in Central America has traveled a long and
difficult path. In this connection the U.S. action against Panama,
undertaken at a very crucial period for that region, gives rise to
grave concern. We have expressed our attitude toward the use of
force, toward contempt for international law. We hope that a sense
of realism will prevail in Washington and that respect will be
shown for the legitimate interests of Central American states and
their right to free choice.
   It can be seen from this brief inventory that there will be
something for us to talk about with Secretary of State James Baker
early in February in Moscow. We expect to have productive
discussions.
   Q: President Bush has said that the United States wants closer
cooperation with the Soviet Union, and Secretary Baker has
suggested that cooperation might include technical advice in areas
such as international monetary affairs. The U.S. administration is
moving toward removal of trade barriers. What forms of cooperation
would you say are most needed or would be most effective, and what
short-term benefits are expected from improved trade relations?
   A: In the sphere of economic cooperation we think, just like the
United States does, both of short-term and long-term mutual
benefits. For all the difficulties of economic conditions in our
country, the situation is not such that we need ``the last straw.''
We have vast reserves. And the purpose of perestroika is to
mobilize the reserves.
   At this time perestroika is going through perhaps the most
difficult period of transition from one economic management system
and political structure to another. It turned out that the most
difficult revolution is a peaceful revolution, a change in the
minds of people.
   We have a perestroika concept. We are continuing our creative
search for approaches to implementing some of its individual
elements. Despite all the difficulties, we keep moving steadily
ahead. And we are convinced of our ultimate success.
   One of the elements of the economic program of perestroika is
the integration of our country into the world economy system. Our
economic ties with the United States could have no small role to
play here. The strategic goal is truly large-scale, mutually
advantageous cooperation and interaction of Soviet and American
economies. This would benefit both sides.
   Unfortunately, what stands in the way is the remaining
discriminatory barriers, whether the absence of the
most-favored-nation treatment or the outdated COCOM regulations
(restricting high-technology exports). We hope that the readiness
the U.S. Administration declared in Malta to move toward
normalization of trade and economic relations will be translated
into concrete deeds.

   Q: The United States and Soviet Union are pressing for a
strategic arms reduction agreement in principle by June and for
signing of a START treaty this year. Yet, there has been little if
any progress reported on the most difficult longstanding obstacles
to agreement. Will the Soviet Union sign and implement a strategic
arms reduction treaty that does not limit sea-launched cruise
missiles or restrict the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative?
   A: One of the most important results at Malta was the political
decisions of the sides to conclude a START treaty in 1990.
Generally speaking, this year can become ``the disarmament year.''
It is quite realistic to reach agreements also in areas such as the
reduction of conventional armed forces in Europe and the
elimination of chemical weapons.
   Thus, our joint policies have been defined very clearly. It now
remains to translate them into negotiating positions.
   As to the fundamental issues that you have touched upon, we
submitted back in Wyoming compromise proposals on sea-launched
cruise missiles. We are willing to limit them outside the treaty
framework on the condition that the relevant provisions will be
recorded concurrently with the treaty, will be mandatory and
subject to verification.
   We are willing to sign and implement a START treaty even without
agreement on space if the sides continue to observe the ABM
(Anti-ballistic Missile) Treaty as signed in 1972. That was also a
major step that we took in Wyoming. It is to be hoped that
Secretary Baker will bring to Moscow adequate responses to our
initiatives. It is not too long before he comes here.
   Q: Does the United States' support for the independence of the
Baltic republics contribute to the separatist campaign in Lithuania
and elsewhere, and will you seek a change in U.S. policy as part of
President Gorbachev's effort to prevent breakup of the union?
   A: We know the position of the United States, which does not
recognize the entry of the Baltic republics into the Union. Our
assessment of it must be well known to you, too.
   As to the specific aspects of establishing a truly federative
structure of our country to supercede the unitarism that actually
existed, and setting up a new mechanism of relationships between
the republics and the center, these problems are addressed in the
course of a broad dialogue in our country taking into account the
interests of all the ethnic groups.
   The secession of some particular republics from the Union would
produce not only additional military-political and economic
stresses for their population, but could also result in a major
destabilization of the existing international structure. It is in
no one's interest to see this happen.
   The problems of inter-ethnic relations are so delicate and
sensitive that one should avoid any outside interference in the
process of their development. Otherwise, one can provoke
unpredicatble repercussions.
   I should say that on the whole we see that responsible
politicians are aware of this.
   Thus, recently the U.S. administration has reaffirmed that since
the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union,
the United States recognizes the territorial integrity of our
country. The principles, recorded in the Helsinki Final Act to
which the United States affixed its signature, are also well known.
   Q: An article signed ``Z'' in the American magazine ``Daedalus''
has provoked something of a sensation with its contention that
President Gorbachev's attempts at reform are futile and that the
West should therefore not try to help them succeed. Perhaps the
article is getting particular attention right now due to the
climate, with Lithuania trying to break from Moscow, the Caucasus
ablaze with ethnic quarrels and the economy unable to provide basic
food and consumer goods to people throughout the country. How would
you respond to ``Z''?
   A: I know about the article by ``Z'' from its newspaper version.
It is strange that the bag of cliches it contains about the demise
of socialism is portrayed as something of a sensation. This was
written and spoken about many times over the past 70 years. And
such forecasts always turned out to be in the dump of history.
   The article's author, who seems to be prone to stereotype
thinking, has completely distorted ideas about the content of
perestroika and about the nature of the ongoing processes within
Soviet society. It is our impression that the changes occurring in
the world are not to his taste altogether and that he does not like
the administration's course, which is supported by most Americans,
for a ``new closeness' with the Soviet Union.
   As to our own difficulties, we do know about them, and we do not
conceal them. But we are confident that these difficulties will be
overcome because there is no alternative to perestroika.
   There is much work ahead of us, and we are prepared to do it.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision to send
troops to quell the Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict has dragged native
Russians into the conflict, throwing a volatile new ingredient into
a simmering ethnic stew.
   Both Armenians and Azerbaijanis now accuse Gorbachev and the
Russian-dominated Kremlin leadership of letting the 2-year-old
battle over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region slip out of
control.
   The decision on Jan. 19 to send soldiers to crush armed
nationalists in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, has focused
resentment on Slavic soldiers, their dependents, and Russians who
live in the region.
   While Gorbachev pleaded for a united Soviet Union to help solve
the Caucasus dilemma, Russian mothers were telling him they were
not interested in risking their sons' lives to stop the killing. In
their view, the Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute was more like the
unpopular war in Afghanistan than an issue of internal security.
   Major Gen. Sergei Kupreyev, a member of the special commission
from Moscow administering Nagorno-Karabakh, complained in the Jan.
23 issue of the weekly New Times magazine that neither Armenians
nor Azerbaijanis wanted to compromise.
   ``No reasonable words are accepted now,'' he said. ``We are
doing everything we can to talk our informal leaders into starting
negotiations, but the war is going on, and our efforts are all in
vain.''
   The military move, intended to restore order in Baku after
Azerbaijanis began attacking and killing the minority Armenians,
united Azerbaijanis against Moscow.
   The Azerbaijan government demanded withdrawal of the Soviet
soldiers and an end to the state of emergency. It threatened to
secede from the Soviet Union. Never before had it so openly defied
Moscow.
   Most of the republic went on strike in protest.
   In an area where the truth often is obscured by a maddening
blurring of the facts, the number of people killed by the military
was a source of exaggeration.
   ``Comrades! In Baku more than 9,000 people were killed,'' read
one sign carried by two young men in a march in Moscow the day that
the dead actually were being buried in Baku. But in the Azerbaijani
capital, there were not 9,000 graves. There were 119, and that
figure was higher than that offered by official sources, which put
the toll at 83 including 14 servicemen and members of their
families.
   Baku journalist Shain Hadjiev said most of the soldiers sent
into Baku appeared to be Russians. Posters declaring Gorbachev
``the butcher of the Azerbaijani people'' were displayed during
rallies in Baku, he said.
   In a period of high ethnic awareness spurred by Gorbachev's
reforms, Russians now are regarded by some in republics such as the
Baltics and Moldavia as unwelcome colonizers.
   Until now, they had managed to stay out of direct involvement in
the conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   But world chess champion Garri Kasparov, a Jewish-Armenian
native of Azerbaijan who got 60 of his friends and relatives out of
Baku during the ethnic violence, told a Moscow news conference that
the conflict in Baku could envelope the Russian population.
   ``If clashes are provoked between Russians and Azerbaijanis, and
if there are victims or refugees among the Russian population, just
think what might happen if they show up in Moscow,'' he told a news
conference.
   It was unclear how many of the victims in Baku were family
members of servicemen, but Soviet officials took the threat
seriously. By Wednesday, more than 16,000 dependents had been
evacuated.
   Officials reported that the evacuation program was suspended
Thursday because of assurances from the Azerbaijan People's Front
that dependents no longer were in danger.
   The labor newspaper Trud reported attacks on the homes of some
of Baku's 100,000 Russians, and said Azerbaijanis were refusing to
sell food to Russians. The Interfax news service, a publication of
the official Radio Moscow, said anti-Russian and anti-military
speeches were being made at rallies in many Azerbaijani cities.
   Russian parents were having none of Gorbachev's appeals. The
flashpoint was a decision to call up reserves on Russian territory
north of the Caucasus Mountains to help restore order in Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
   ``I won't give up my son!'' a woman shouted in film broadcast
nationwide by Soviet TV from Stavropol, Gorbachev's political power
base. ``We put up with everything, we put up with it, we put up
with it, how long are we going to put up with everything?''
   ``We don't want the peoples of these republics to call us
occupants. We don't want another Afghanistan,'' said another.
   Faced with such ire, the Kremlin unceremoniously backed down.
   Kupreyev noted that the bitter experience in Afghanistan and
Gorbachev's opening of Soviet society had affected soldiers'
attitudes.
   ``Soldiers don't want to die in domestic ethnic clashes,'' he
said. ``There is some displeasure among the troops.''

<HEAD>Haiti Clampdown: On the Road Back To Duvalierism?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitians were outraged in 1988 when
thugs beat a priest and killed 13 members of his congregation. A
coup ousted the ruling general and installed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
as president.
   Now, 16 months later, many Haitians are wondering whether Avril
is leading them back into the morass of corruption, repression and
fear they knew under his predecessor, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, and
during the 29-year reign of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his
son Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc.''
   Over the past two weeks, soldiers have reportedly rounded up,
arrested and brutalized a dozen political activists and forced at
least seven into exile.
   Declaring a 30-day ``state of siege,'' Avril suspended four
articles of the constitution and then imposed censorship on
television and radio stations, the main source of news in a nation
where 85 percent of the population is illiterate.
   The military government declared the state of siege Jan. 20, one
day after gunmen killed an army colonel, his wife and their maid.
   The clampdown, Avril said, was necessary ``to protect democratic
accomplishments against terrorism,'' implying that enemies of the
government carried out the assassination.
   Skeptics saw it, however, as a pretext for Avril to consolidate
his power and renege on his promise to hold legitimate elections in
October.
   ``The government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate
there will be no elections or have elections without the
opposition's participation, with controlled candidates,'' said Paul
Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto Rico.
   President Bush's administration has sharply protested Avril's
``blatant attack on basic civil liberties'' and indicated there
will be no early resumption of Washington's $60 million annual aid
package.
   Anguished telephone calls at all hours to a reporter in
Port-au-Prince, the capital, suggest an underlying sense of
forboding in Haiti.
   Marie-Michelle de Ronceray, whose husband, Hubert, was among the
opposition politicians beaten and exiled, tells of police cars
arriving at her house every four hours with sirens blaring. ``I
don't know what my status is,'' she said. ``I'm not leaving the
house.''
   ``I'm on the edge of a nervous breakdown,'' said an adviser to a
former presidential candidate. ``All these events remind me of life
under Papa Doc.''
   Papa Doc, the country doctor who encouraged peasants to regard
him as the personification of Baron Samedi, the voodoo god of the
dead, ruled Haiti by naked terror. His agents were the omnipresent
Tonton Macoutes _ in Creole folkore, a macoute is a bogeyman _ with
their dark glasses, sneers and guns.
   By the time of his death in 1971, Duvalier had amassed a
multimillion-dollar fortune through graft.
   Haiti, which was once a lush French possession, had become one
of the poorest nations in the world. An estimated 80 percent of the
country's 5.7 million people live in extreme poverty.
   Baby Doc, his slow-witted son, carried on the family tradition,
but with more attention to throwing opulent costume balls in the
National Palace than to the affairs of state. A popular uprising
finally forced him into exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   Namphy, then head of the army, was left in charge, but any hopes
that he might move Haiti toward democracy were dashed when the
country attempted to hold the first fair elections in its history
on Nov. 29, 1987.
   Assassins in cahoots with the army shot and hacked to death at
least 34 voters at polling stations, giving Namphy the opportunity
to abort the election. Washington suspended its foreign aid.
   The following January, the army staged an election won by
university professor Leslie Manigat. But when Manigat moved to
control the army, he was overthrown by Namphy in June of the same
year.
   On Sept. 11, 1988, hundreds of people elbowed their way into St.
Jean Bosco's Roman Catholic church to hear the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, fiery champion of human rights and No. 1 enemy of the
military regime.
   He had just begun his sermon when 20 or so thugs wielding guns,
machetes, spikes and clubs burst in and set upon the congregation.
They killed at least 13 people and wounded 70, including a pregnant
woman who was stabbed in the stomach, and then burned the church.
   In a nation accustomed to violence, the outrage sent a new wave
of revulsion through the population and the ranks of the army. One
week later, non-commissioned officers overthrew Namphy, and Avril,
the army adjutant, became president.
   Having survived a soldiers' rebellion last April with the
support of his 1,100-man Presidential Guard, Avril appears secure
for the time being.

<TEXT>
   The Super Bowl victory celebration, San
Francisco's fourth in nine years, spilled onto the streets of the
city even before Sunday's game in New Orleans ended.
   ``They did a perfect job. From the beginning, we knew they would
win,'' said Tasi Silifaiva, among a carload of young San Francisco
49ers fans in the Mission District.
   Late in the fourth quarter, with the 49ers well on their way to
a 55-10 victory over the Denver Broncos, car horns were blaring on
the city's thoroughfares. Firecrackers were popping, and police
said there were reports of some celebratory gunshots being fired.
   Crowds spilling off sidewalks in some areas blocked traffic, and
some groups of fans rocked stopped buses.
   By early evening, there were no reports of celebration violence
such as occurred in 1982, the night the 49ers won their first Super
Bowl.
   Fan Ernesto Gonzalez, declared, ``The 49ers are a great team and
it was a great game. It was lopsided, but Denver needed to be
taught a lesson, to be told where San Francisco was coming from.''
   On Monday, the team will be honored with a parade down Market
Street.
   Not everyone in the City by the Bay shares the football
enthusiasm.
   Teacher Sonja Jones took advantage of the sunny weather and
empty streets to take a long bike ride while her husband was
watching the game on TV with friends.
   ``On Super Bowl Sunday, I kiss him off for about five hours,''
Ms. Jones said.
   ``The streets were empty. All you saw were big fat men waddling
out of bars yelling the score,'' she added. ``It's a mutual
testosterone celebration.''

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Warns Republics' Secession Could Destabilize
World Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze says
secession by some independence-minded Soviet republics would cause
military, political and economic problems for them, and also could
``result in a major destabilization of the existing international
structure.''
   ``It is in no one's interest to see this happen,'' he said in a
written response to questions submitted before a rare one-on-one
interview.
   Shevardnadze's home republic, Georgia, is among those with an
active nationalist movement.
   ``The problems of inter-ethnic relations are so delicate and
sensitive that one should avoid any outside interference in the
process of their development,'' he said when asked if U.S. support
for the independence of the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia contributes to separatist feelings there.
   ``I should say that on the whole we see that responsible
politicians are aware of this,'' he said, noting the United States
has reaffirmed its recognition of the territorial integrity of the
Soviet Union.
   The interview in Shevardnadze's wood-paneled office on Thursday
and the text of the written exchange with The Associated Press were
released by mutual agreement on Sunday.
   The Soviet foreign minister acknowledged widespread concern in
the West for the survivability of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
but ascribed it more to a popular desire that Gorbachev's reforms
succeed than to any real threat to the Communist Party chief's
political power.
   Asked about oft-stated worries in the West that spreading chaos
in the Soviet Union could cause a backlash that would sweep
Gorbachev from power, Shevardnadze replied: ``I believe that this
particular preoccupation stems from sincere feelings, from sincere
support for the process of perestroika that is under way in the
Soviet Union.''
   The soft-spoken, white-haired Georgian, a Gorbachev ally on the
ruling Politburo, noted it was Gorbachev ``who spearheaded this
arduous but holy struggle.''
   ``There is some segment of the population that is definitely
disappointed'' by Gorbachev's efforts at reform, he said. But he
claimed, ``Gorbachev and the political leadership of this country
on the whole do enjoy the support of the bulk of the Soviet people,
in spite of the fact that we are experiencing great difficulties;
we have empty shelves in stores; we have a host of other social,
economic and inter-ethnic difficulties.''
   Shevardnadze, 62, a longtime Communist Party boss in Georgia
before Gorbachev tapped him to take over the Foreign Ministry
nearly five years ago, said the Soviet leader's opponents ``do not
really constitute a significant force.''
   Communist Party sources say the party is becoming more
polarized, with hard-liners expected to mount a challenge to
Gorbachev's leadership when the national body's Central Committee
meets in Moscow on Feb. 5.
   A progressive faction also has formed, and sources say it may
stage an attack at the same meeting on the party's constitutional
monopoly on power, and demand a virtual apology for decades of
totalitarian Communist rule.
   The strength of either group is difficult to measure, but the
problems for Gorbachev, who seeks to portray himself as a centrist,
have mounted in recent weeks.
   Lithuania's Communist Party broke with Moscow last month in a
campaign for independence. This month, long-simmering ethnic
hatreds and territorial disputes burst into open warfare in the
southern Caucasus.
   ``Our life is not easy,'' Shevardnaze said in the interview,
speaking seriously from the outset about the domestic crises and
ambitious foreign-policy goals of the Gorbachev regime. ``It's
difficult ... but without drama, there is no revolution. It is
something that's concommitant to revolutionary change.''
   He defended the decision to send troops into the southern
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia as one ``to use force for the
purpose of saving people,'' saying the outbreak of ethnic violence
there ``was nothing short of civil war.''
   The decision, he said, ``does not correspond to either our
internal convictions or to our sentiments in general, because in
principle we are opposed to use of any force anywhere.''
   ``As the situation in that region stabilizes, we will gradually
withdraw our forces from there,'' he pledged.
   Juggling foreign policy issues and domestic problems, which he
said can't be entirely separated from each other, Shevardnadze
predicted ``the most important event of this year'' will be the
June summit meeting in the United States between Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   He expressed confidence that he and U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker, whom he referred to as ``my friend,'' will make
further progress toward an agreement to halve the superpowers'
strategic, or long-range, nuclear arsenals. The two are to meet in
Moscow on Feb. 7 for a two-day session that was put off a day at
the Kremlin's request to prevent its overlapping with the Central
Committee meeting.
   Shevardnadze was asked if the Kremlin would sign a strategic
arms reduction treaty that did not limit sea-launched cruise
missiles or the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program _ two longtime sticking
points in negotiations.
   In a written response, he said: ``We are willing to limit (the
missiles) outside the treaty framework, on the condition that the
relevant provisions will be recorded concurrently with the treaty,
will be mandatory and subject to verification.''
   ``We are willing to sign and implement a START treaty even
without agreement on space, if the sides continue to observe the
ABM (Anti-ballistic Missile) treaty as signed in 1972,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Noting that was an offer he made when he and Baker met in
Jackson, Wyo., last fall, the Soviet negotiator added, ``It is to
be hoped that Secretary Baker will bring to Moscow adequate
responses to our initiatives.''
   Shevardnadze said Soviet and U.S. efforts to work together in
solving potentially explosive regional conflicts led to the
political settlement that helped Namibia achieve independence.
   ``The machinery to promote a Cambodian settlement is shifting
into higher gear,'' he added. And borrowing a phrase from the
Vietnam era, he added: ``It seems we can now see the light at the
end of the tunnel there.''
   He called on Israel to ``take advantage of the opportunities
that are there'' to find peace in the Middle East and said, ``A
political settlement in Afghanistan is literally knocking on the
door. Reliance on military force has outlived itself.''
   Taking one jab at the United States for the Dec. 20 invasion of
Panama, Shevardnadze said: ``The peace process in Central America
has traveled a long and difficult path. In this connection, the
U.S. action against Panama, undertaken at a very crucial period for
that region, gives rise to grave concern. We have expressed our
attitude toward the use of force, toward contempt for international
law.
   ``We hope that a sense of realism will prevail in Washington and
that respect will be shown for the legitimate interests of Central
American states and their right to free choice.''

<HEAD>Super Bowl Protesters Call for More Action on POWs, MIAs</HEAD>

   About 50 protesters took a bamboo ``tiger
cage'' and a coffin to the Superdome on Super Sunday to dramatize
their concern over soldiers missing in action and those they
believe are prisoners of war.
   Participants in the protest dubbed Operation End Zone lined a
street outside the domed stadium, chanting and waving flags and
signs as thousands of Super Bowl ticketholders walked by. A few
stopped to look or ask questions.
   At the Vietnam War Memorial just outside the Superdome, Ann
Curran laid a wreath in honor of her son, Marine Capt. Patrick
Curran.
   Curran, whose 46th birthday was Sunday, has been missing in
action since his plane went down on a bombing mission over Laos in
1969, the government says.
   Mrs. Curran believes her son is a prisoner of war.
   ``I still look forward to him coming home or when I can go and
get him,'' said the Bensenville, Ill., woman. ``I'm angry. I'm in
pain. Does he think that he's been abandoned?''
   During the demonstration, a long-haired, gray-bearded man sat
passively inside the cage, a replica of those sometimes used to
hold prisoners during the Vietnam War.
   A couple of feet away, the black coffin, draped with a folded
American flag and a POW-MIA flag, sat on a white caisson.
   The protest was sponsored by EVAC, a Des Plaines, Ill.-based
support group for POWs and MIAs.
   ``The message is there are still men and women unaccounted-for
from Vietnam, Korea and World War II,'' said John Opager, founder
of EVAC.

   Three hours before the Super Bowl, members of
the Krewe of Troy paraded through the streets of suburban Slidell
to kick off the month-long Carnival season.
   The group was accompanied Sunday by marching bands, dance teams
and masked revelers.
   ``I hope the NFL won't be upset at us if we take some of their
crowd away from them,'' said Bob Lewis, captain of the club.
   Between now and Mardi Gras on Feb. 27, about 70 parades will
roll through the area, which on Sunday was host of the National

   As they approach their 50th birthdays,
newsman Ted Koppel said he doesn't have the ``sex appeal'' to be an
anchorman, and colleague Tom Brokaw said he expects to have a new
job before he turns 65.
   NBC's Brokaw, born Feb. 6, 1940, and Koppel, who was born two
days later, reflect on their careers in the Feb. 3 issue of TV
Guide.
   ``By the end of this decade I will be doing, in one form or
another, what I'm doing now _ reporting,'' said Koppel, of ABC-TV's
``Nightline.'' ``At one time I did want to be a news anchor, but I
know I don't have the pizzazz.
   ``Apart from their talents as journalists, Peter (Jennings), Tom
(Brokaw) and Dan (Rather) are also extremely attractive and have a
level of sex appeal that I don't have.''
   Brokaw, however, said he does not see himself doing the same
thing down the line.
   ``I believe there'll always be a place for an evening network
news program, but I don't think I'll be here for another 15
years,'' said the ``NBC Nightly News'' anchorman. ``I'd like more
time I could count on, which I can't now because I'm so tied to
world events.''

   Phil Donahue claims competition from
``tabloid television'' is causing his 23-year-old talk show
increasingly to buck serious subjects for sensational issues that
will draw an audience.
   Recent ``Donahue'' shows have featured Zsa Zsa Gabor and the
Australian tavern practice of dwarf-tossing.
   ``I didn't toss the dwarfs,'' protested Donahue. ``Someone else
did it and demonstrated that it's being done actually as a
commercial activity. I don't apologize for a moment that I exposed
this activity on my program. It's important.''
   There was a time when Donahue could build his 60-minute show
around a single politician and focus a discussion on one issue.
   Now, Donahue said, the only congressional representative he
could construct a show around would be Rep. Barney Frank, the
homosexual Democrat from Massachusetts.
   ``If you don't understand how we survive in TV, no argument I
make is going to make a difference,'' Donahue said in an interview
published in Sunday's Los Angeles Times. ``We get paid to draw a
crowd. When we don't draw a crowd, we don't get paid.''

   Black filmmakers Wendell B. Harris and
Charles Burnett won top honors at the Sundance United States Film
Festival with two low-budget, deeply personal movies.
   ``Chameleon Street,'' a quirky look at a peerless con man, took
writer-director-star Harris four years and nearly four dozen
investors to make. The film, awarded the Grand Jury Prize, was
produced by Harris' mother, Helen.
   ``To Sleep With Anger,'' an alternately haunting and comic
account of a family crisis, was completed by writer-director
Burnett just days before the festival began. It won a Special Jury
Prize.
   Neither ``To Sleep With Anger'' nor ``Chameleon Street'' have
distributors, but their victories this weekend are likely to propel
them to theaters soon.
   The festival, which ended Sunday, was organized by actor Robert
Redford's Sundance Institute to focus attention on independent,
against-all-odds filmmaking.
   ``There's nothing worse than a commercially compromised art
project,'' said Jim Stark, producer of the independent hits
``Stranger Than Paradise'' and ``Down By Law.'' ``You can't make a
better `Top Gun' than the studios can.''

   Country music star Waylon Jennings is
singing a different tune since gaining a high school eqivalency
diploma: ``Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be dropouts.''
   Jennings was scheduled to accept his General Educational
Development certificate from Kentucky first lady Martha Wilkinson
at the Capitol in Frankfort today.
   He enrolled in Kentucky Educational Television's ``GED on TV''
program last fall after talking about it with Mrs. Wilkinson, the
wife of Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. He passed the exam in December
after studying tapes on his tour bus.
   Mrs. Wilkinson said Jennings, whose hits include ``Mama, Don't
Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys'' (with Willie Nelson) and
the theme to ``The Dukes of Hazzard'' TV show, was ecstatic when he
had learned he had passed.
   ``I've got to admit, I don't think I've ever talked to a
teen-ager more excited,'' Mrs. Wilkinson said. ``He yelled on the
phone, `I really did it!' And it actually was a yell.''

   New Kids on the Block, the hottest
teen-age pop group since the Jacksons and Menudo, say they want to
be role models for the youth of today.
   ``A lot of people associate musicians with drugs, and craziness,
and being bad people,'' said New Kid Jon Knight, 20. ``But that's
not what we want to be with this group.''
   Last week, New Kids was named Favorite Pop Rock Group at the
American Music Awards. Their album, ``Hangin' Tough Live,'' has
sold 7 million copies and was named the Favorite Pop Rock Album at
the awards show.
   ``Joining the group was something like basketball: If you play
basketball you can stay off the streets, you can set a goal. Music
has made a goal for us,'' Danny Wood, 19, said in an interview
published in The Tennessean Sunday.
   The other members of the quintet are Donnie Wahlberg, 20, the

13 when he joined in 1984.

   The Coast Guard is opposing a planned 18,000-seat
amphitheater at the Metrozoo, saying it could interfere with the
war on drugs.
   The amphitheater would lead to road congestion and noise
problems for the 400 Coast Guard personnel and family members
stationed at a nearby command post that's used to monitor drug
traffic off Florida, Cmdr. George Johnson has told Dade County
officials.
   ``We're not against the project per se, but we're against moving
forward with it until the concerns we've expressed are dealt
with,'' said Johnson, who has asked the South Florida Regional
Planning Council to delay action on the plans.
   Zoo officials say the amphitheater may help alleviate financial
problems at the park, about 15 miles south of Miami.
   Under the present plan, Houston-based PACE Entertainment would
get a long-term lease for the amphitheater and Metrozoo would
receive a percentage of its income.
   Zev Bufman, one of the project's backers, said the developers
are planning to present blueprints and other details to the Coast
Guard next month.
   ``Our architects and engineers will gladly sit down with their
people and make whatever changes they recommend so they feel
secure,'' said Bufman, a co-owner of the National Basketball
Association's Miami Heat.
   But Johnson said the materials used in the amphitheater
construction may create intolerable radio static.
   ``Any time you put in a steel structure, it creates
interference,'' he said. ``We need to know exactly what it's going
to look like so we can determine if it will block transmission to
the facility.''
   The Seventh Coast Guard District patrols 1.8 million square
miles of ocean from South Carolina to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<HEAD>Reporters May Face Hazardous Duty at Colombia Drug Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House reporters are mostly joking when
they say they are nervous about covering the drug summit in
Cartagena, Colombia, next month. Mostly _ but not entirely.
   ``My mother has said plaintively to me, `Don't go to
Colombia,''' said one journalist who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``What do you do? I don't want to lie to her.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says the Secret Service
is confident it can provide protection for President Bush in
Colombia on Feb. 15, but it has no authority to do the same for
reporters.
   Some journalists said they have discussed the possible danger of
the assignment, but for the most part reporters covering the
president regard it as part of their job.
   ``It's a trip,'' said Michel McQueen of The Wall Street Journal.
``He's going, so I'm going. That's the way that goes.''
   Under usual procedure a White House press pool of 11 reporters
would travel on Air Force One and spend about four hours on the
ground while Bush meets with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
officials of Peru and Bolivia on Feb. 15.
   A larger contingent of reporters would fly in with the president
in a chartered press plane, with some organizations sending crews
ahead of time on their own.
   Plans were thrown into uncertainty, however, by reports this
week that Colombian drug lords are plotting to shoot down the
presidential plane. Although the White House scoffed at the
reports, CBS News said the Secret Service was considering other
ways of taking the president to Colombia. No details were provided.
   Fitzwater said Wednesday there was a ``good chance'' the White
House would put most of the press in another country, such as
Panama, Costa Rica or Venezuela, during the summit, taking only the
small pool to Colombia.
   Tentative plans called for the White House to set up facilities
for the press at a commercial airport at Cartagena near the
expected summit site.
   The White House spokesman said he talked with a number of
reporters and they were ``generally favorable to having the filing
center in another country.''
   Meanwhile, reporters cluster around the sign-up sheet in the
White House press room looking at the names and joking about
``these brave souls, or these idiots, or whatever,'' said Karen
Hosler of The Baltimore Sun.
   ``I am not worried about it,'' she said, ``but my family and
friends have raised some questions.''
   Movements of the press corps making the trip with Bush are
expected to be severely limited.
   One reporter said the journalists most concerned were those who
would be going down separately ahead of time.
   ``If I were going in with Bush I would feel a little better, but
I don't speak Spanish even,'' said this reporter, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Bill Headline, Washington bureau chief of Cable News Network,
said, ``We have had some informal discussion among producers and
White House reporters but have not really decided what we ought to
do and what not to do. We will be looking at that in the next few
days.''
   Tim Russert, bureau chief for NBC News, said, ``We are still
basically waiting for the White House as to what kind of
arrangements will be made in terms of the president. Journalists
want to report the news, but people aren't suicidal either, so we
will take every possible precaution that guarantees our people's
lives and still allows us to report the story.''
   Russert said NBC cameramen are routinely provided with flak
jackets for use on dangerous assignments and ``are certainly free
to wear them whether they are reporting here or in Colombia.''
   George Watson, Washington bureau chief for ABC News, said, ``The
White House has indicated the Secret Service will do all that it
can to protect the media in a more intensive fashion than they
normally would do. None of our producers, correspondents or crews
has declined to go or indicated in any way they don't want the
assignment.''
   Barbara Cohen, bureau chief at CBS, said there had been no
reluctance there, either.
   ``In the press corps in general, there's the normal joking and
kidding, but that's very predictable,'' said Jim Gerstenzang, White
House correspondent for the Los Angeles Times.
   Nicholas Horrock, bureau chief for the Chicago Tribune, said he
and one other Washington reporter were making the trip. ``I'm
looking at the guy,'' Horrock joked. ``If he's reluctant to go to
Cartagena, I'm going to kill him.''

   Fire broke out in a Bourbon Street bar late
Sunday as the streets of the French Quarter were jammed with fans
celebrating after the Super Bowl, but was contained within an hour.
   A police officer and a firefighter were treated for injuries
received fighting the blaze, said officials who weren't able to say
how seriously they were hurt.
   The fire broke out on the third floor of the Cat's Meow bar
about 9:30 p.m. and was contained by 10:20 p.m., said Fire
Department Superintendent William McCrossen. The cause was under
investigation.
   ``It looked like fog was rolling in and next thing the flames
were shooting out from the building. Lots of black smoke. Quite
scary actually,'' said Marty Swann of New Jersey, who watched from
a nearby balcony.
   Between 75 and 100 people were inside the bar and several
thousand strolled outside on Bourbon Street when the fire began.
   Police quickly evacuated and cordoned off the area surrounding
the the three-story building, which is located in the heart of the
city's historical district.
   ``The police finally came in and did a real good job. The
mounted police came in and kind of pushed everybody away,'' Swann
said. ``The crowd wasn't really sure why the police were moving
everybody back at that point, they were too busy having a good time
in the street.''

<HEAD>OSHA Head Says His Corporate Experience Shows Safety Pays</HEAD>

   Gerard F. Scannell shudders when he recalls
the amputations that some pharmaceutical workers suffered before he
instituted safety reforms at Johnson &amp; Johnson plants worldwide.
   As the head of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, he's banking on the conviction that corporate
executives share that feeling.
   But as a former executive himself, he believes compassion can be
bolstered by the bottom line: safety expenditures save money in the
long run.
   He draws the conclusion from 11 years directing corporate safety
for the New Brunswick, N.J.-based drug giant, where workplace
injuries dropped more than 90 percent during his tenure.
   ``I made money for them,'' he says. ``Safety does pay.''
   At the Labor Department, Scannell began translating some of that
corporate-mindedness to safeguarding the nation's workplaces even
before his October confirmation.
   ``My plan is to get to those CEOs,'' he says. ``I was on the
firing line out there in industry. I think I know what I'm talking
about and I think people know that. It's not going to be easy for
people to bluff me.''
   Health threats abound in office and factory air, in dangerous
machinery, on construction sites, in stresses and strains from
unnatural movements. Scannell is worried about repetitive strain
injuries in everything from the wrists of word processing typists
to the arms of meatpackers.
   He hopes to begin attacking the latter class of problems by
releasing ergonomic guidelines for the red meat industry in
February.
   His agency also is battling dentists who argue they cannot
afford to meet proposed standards to protect health workers from
blood-borne pathogens that cause hepatitis and AIDS. Scannell hopes
to get those standards in place by year's end.
   Scannell, 54, has hopscotched between jobs in government and
industry, including safety posts with Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co.,
Thiokol Chemical Corp. and Rohm &amp; Haas Co., and a stint at OSHA
from 1971 to 1979. He has shown a willingness to confront possible
detractors by seeking out labor leaders, industry officials,
academics, doctors _ anyone who will listen.
   One of the adversaries he faced is safety gadfly Joseph Kinney,
executive director of the nonprofit National Safe Workplace
Institute in Chicago.
   ``Scannell is deeply committed to making progress,'' Kinney said
in a telephone interview. ``He came here twice. It was kind of a
surprise when he called us. I said, `Are you sure you've got the
right organization?'''
   After all, Kinney says, government had not previously
appreciated his group's work: ``The Reagan administration hated us
passionately.''
   Kinney is waiting to see whether Scannell continues slapping
companies with large fines such as the $7.3 million against USX
Corp. last November for alleged safety, record-keeping and health
violations.
   But Scannell prides himself most on being a negotiator who can
elicit voluntary compliance from a company rather than collect a
stiff fine while bad practices continue.
   ``If I can get better protection for workers by lowering
penalties, I'm going to do it. I'm going to extract more out of you
in promises than I can probably legally cite you for,'' Scannell
says. ``I want more than what the standards require.''
   Those who know Scannell say that as the first person to
dismantle a live Sidewinder missile back in the late 1950s _ he did
so as a Navy explosives expert _ he knows what safety means.
   But others worry he will be hamstrung by the Office of
Management and Budget.
   Scannell says he could use double the budget and personnel, but
notes Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has won from Congress another
$14.9 million and 179 new inspectors.
   ``I have the support to make things happen,'' he says.
   Margaret Seminario, associate director for occupational safety
and health at the AFL-CIO, sees promise with Scannell serving under
Mrs. Dole.
   ``My impression of him is he's a serious individual who wants to
run a serious, effective health and safety program,'' she says.
   Although she doesn't doubt Mrs. Dole's commitment to a stronger
OSHA, she says questions remain about whether the White House and
OMB are similarly committed.
   She's hopeful Scannell can resist industry pressures to weaken
proposed standards for blood-borne pathogens and work in confined
spaces such as tanks and manholes.
   Jordan Barab, health and safety coordinator for the 1.2 million
workers of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said he was encouraged when Scannell reached out to
labor before his confirmation and included a labor panel at the
fall OSHA managers meeting.
   ``His heart is in the right place,'' Barab says. ``Under Reagan,
we always had the feeling bureaucrats at best wanted to do nothing
and at worst wanted to dismantle.''

<HEAD>Number of Poor up, But Food Stamp Use Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of poor Americans has swelled,
but fewer people are using food stamps, a paradoxical decline
that's no surprise to participants.
   ``It's the same old story,'' said Mildred Lee, 76, of Raleigh.
``I had a hell of a hassle to get them. Ten dollars weren't worth
the hassle I had to go through.''
   Mrs. Lee, whose monthly income is a $406 Social Security check,
has been receiving about $10 a month in food stamps for a year.
   Analysts see many reasons for the food stamp decline _ an
economic rebound, Reagan administration regulations and an outcry
against assistance.
   Many also say Mrs. Lee is right: Red tape keeps people away.
   ``I think the declining rates have been a sign of the success of
the economy, but I think there are still plenty of people out there
in need,'' said Phil Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service.
   Participation declined to an average of 18.8 million in 1988
from 19.8 million in 1980, while the number of people living in
poverty rose to 32.5 million in 1987 from 29.3 million in 1980,
according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
non-profit research group based in Washington.
   ``These figures are rather striking,'' director Robert
Greenstein said. ``Essentially, we now know that the program has
effectively been tightened _ and reduced in scope _ considerably
more than has commonly been recognized.''
   Food stamp usage has plunged in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and
Southeast during the 1980s, according a state-by-state study by the
Washington-based Public Voice advocacy group.
   The greatest gains have come in the Southwest, the High Plains
and Midwest, where poverty rates also have been running higher.
   Participating households now are forced to make a monthly
economic status, forcing some eligible people to wonder, ``Why
bother?''
   One of the dropouts is a former Lenoir County resident who
remained eligible even after she landed a job as a waitress.
   ``The truth is, see, I worked, and I got a little bit of child
support and each month I had to fill out a monthly report,'' said
the 35-year-old mother, who was single at the time. ``It was not
worth the hassle of having to go up there and do a monthly report.
But when I did get them sometimes (they) helped a lot. Without them
we would have starved.''
   The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she
received between $10 and $100 a month.
   ``Even when I got the $10, the $10 would help get a little extra
something special for my daughter,'' she said. ``Maybe she would
want a hamburgers or pizza or something we didn't eat. Maybe with
that $10 I would get her a small frozen pizza.''
   Federal officials question any strict correlation between food
stamp usage and the growing poor.
   ``The two usually go hand in hand but that has been less so in
the past few years. And they don't know exactly why that is,''
Shanholtzer said. ``We've heard, too, that some people don't
participate because of the hassle involved.''
   In North Carolina, where participation is down more than 32
percent from 10 years ago, a task force is studying the program's
waning popularity.
   In addition to a low jobless rate, federal policy changes that
began around 1980 have had a ``tremendous'' impact, said Kay
Fields, chief of public assistance in the state Division of Social
Services.
   For example, families living under the same roof, such as a
single woman with no children who is living with her parents, can
no longer receive a food stamp allotment separate from her parents,
Fields said.
   Federal outreach funds also were cut in half during the 1980s,
she said.
   And in rural areas, small-town pride increasingly appears to be
winning out over need, an attitude encouraged during the Reagan
years.
   While participation fell in the Southeast, it grew 10.4 percent
in the Midwest and 18.3 percent in the High Plains the first seven
years of the decade.
   Wyoming, experiencing an economic downturn due to lower oil
prices, had a jump of 81 percent over the last decade. The state
increased its outreach efforts to boost participation among
low-income elderly.
   Wyoming, North Carolina and other states are considering new
approaches such as a food stamp credit card to help remove the
stigma and cut down on lost and theft of stamps.
   But others say participation won't increase until the benefit
does.
   ``The benefits aren't really high enough,'' said Jane Peel of
New Hampshire's Division of Human Services.

<HEAD>Bone-Breaking Experiments on Dogs Questioned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New questions are being raised about
Army-sponsored research on animals following the removal of a
review panel member who voiced concerns about bone-breaking
experiments on retired greyhound dogs.
   ``The public would be outraged at the excessive amount of tax
dollars that are being wasted on research which does not contribute
to human health,'' Jan Polon said this month, shortly after her
removal from the voluntary post on the animal use committee at
California's Letterman Army Institute of Research.
   Polon, an occupational therapist and the lone public
representative on the review panel, had expressed opposition to
several animal experiments over four years.
   But she blames her dismissal on two letters she sent to
officials at Letterman _ one complaining about the inadequate time
committee members had to review protocols and reference documents,
the other requesting further review of the research protocol on the
greyhound experiment.
   The decision by officials at Letterman, located at the Presidio
in California, prompted Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to question
the operation at the research facility.
   ``It seems clear that LAIR does not want any questions asked
about what is going on behind closed doors,'' Boxer said in a Jan.
5 letter to Army Col. Donald G. Corby, commander of Letterman.
   The California Democrat urged Corby to reconsider his decision,
``since it is certain to be perceived as punitive action which only
elevates public concern about what is going on at LAIR.''
   A spokesman at the Presidio said Polon was simply let go, and
Army officials, in letters to Boxer, have steadfastly defended the
experiments.
   ``This research effort, even to an untrained observer, is not a
waste of money or animals,'' Army Maj. Gen. Philip K. Russell,
medical corps commander at the Army Medical Research and
Development Command at Fort Detrick, Md., said in an Oct. 5, 1989,
letter.
   The removal of Polon is just the latest controversy surrounding
the experiments on greyhounds which has drawn members of Congress,
animal rights activists, Defense Department officials and
representatives from the scientific community into the fray.
   The experiments are on hold _ the result of language in the
defense spending bill for fiscal 1990 prohibiting money for the
tests until the Army secretary certifies that the research has a
military application, meets specific guidelines set by an animal
use committee and is not duplicative.
   The experiments involve removing a piece of bone from the hind
leg of each dog and replacing it with a synthetic compound. After
two months, the greyhounds are killed and their legs examined to
determine the effectiveness of the compound.
   The purpose of the experiments on 118 dogs, according to the
Army, is to find better ways to treat battlefield wounds. Boxer
argues that several physicians and veterinarians as well as the
Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine believe the
experiments serve little scientific purpose and cause unnecessary
suffering for the animals.
   Some physicians have suggested using dogs who have already
suffered bone injuries, Boxer says.
   The Army, in response, said the tests must be conducted on
uniform animals to prevent inconsistent findings. The service is
supported by several major organizations, including the Association
of American Universities, the Association of American Medical
Colleges, the Academy of Surgical Research, Auburn University,
Columbia University and the Western Surgical Association.
   In letters to Boxer, the groups have countered the criticism and
stressed the importance of the experiments.
   ``The proposed research project has been carefully reviewed by
scientists and is most emphatically NOT an example of animal abuse,
faulty science or unnecessary research,'' Dr. Ralph B. Dell of
Columbia University said in a Nov. 3 letter.
   ``Animal research, responsibly and humanely conducted, saves
human lives,'' Dr. M. Ward Crowe of the University of Kentucky said
in a Nov. 22 letter. ``Animal life is not equal to human life.''
   But Dr. Elliot Katz, a veterinarian who heads the animal rights
group, In Defense of Animals, said the greyhound experiments at
Letterman go ``against the grain of scientific standard operating
procedure.''
   Complicating the debate over the testing at Letterman was the
initial disclosure that the dogs may have been illegally sold to
the Army. Owners who thought they had given their dogs to racing
circuits and local hospitals found out they had been sold to the
Army for the experiments.
   The Army later released 19 dogs to their owners or animal rights
activists for adoption. The service also promised to investigate
possible legal action against the dealer who sold them the dogs.
   Boxer said the House Armed Services Committee plans hearings on
the issue.
   Polon's removal ``is a terrible signal. It says, `if you don't
go along with the program, you're out,''' Boxer said in a recent
telephone interview. ``It's a slap to her, a slap at me and a slap
at taxpayers.''

<HEAD>Bush Urges Americans to Reject Bigotry</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Bush addresses religious broadcasters 2 p.m. EST; lead

<TEXT>
   President Bush, worshipping with a black
congregation, says it is time for all Americans to reject ``racism
and bigotry'' and accept the biblical admonition, ``Love thy
neighbor.''
   Bush today was sending Congress his $1.23 trillion budget for
fiscal 1991 and later was addressing the National Religious
Broadcasters' Convention and meeting with Douglas Hurd, Britain's
new foreign secretary.
   On Sunday, before watching the Super Bowl on television with
friends and family, the president and wife Barbara attended
services at John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, where a former Bush
aide was preaching.
   Bush briefly ascended the pulpit to speak out again about the
still-unsolved racial violence that last month claimed the lives of
a federal judge in Alabama and a civil rights lawyer in Georgia.
   Bush spoke of the ``new blossoming of liberty'' unfolding in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere around the world, and said, ``It is
exciting and our great country has played an important role in
promoting this new breeze of freedom and working for peace.
   ``But I am reminded we can only be a great nation abroad if we
are a great nation at home,'' said Bush, as voices in the
congregation responded, ``Amen!''
   ``Let us recommit ourselves to work for justice and for unity of
all people. And let me add, no more letter bombs. No more racism.
Leave the entire baggage of bigotry behind,'' said the president.
   ``It's about time in this country that we replace racism and
bigotry with ... `Love thy neighbor,''' said the president.
   Bush came to the church to hear the guest preacher, Thaddeus
Garrett, whom he called ``my old friend and trusted adviser.''
   Garrett, a top aide when Bush was vice president, is now a
private consultant here as well as associate pastor of Wesley
Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in Akron, Ohio.
   Bush and the minister joked that Bush had asked Garrett to keep
the sermon short.
   ``They're Episcopalians and ... they don't understand that
sometimes we carry on a little bit,'' said Garrett, who proceeded
to deliver a pounding, foot-stomping 20-minute sermon based on a
passage in Luke (8:31-35) about a naked, crazy man who lived in a
cemetery until Jesus drove out his demons.
   Garrett likened him to today's homeless that people step over on
their way to work every morning.
   ``The world around him was ... sicker than he was, because it
provided no housing for him, provided no comfort for him, no care,
no love,'' said the preacher.
   ``It is not him who is sick. It is we who pass him by,'' said
Garrett.
   He ended with an exhortation to the congregation to help those
``wandering through the cemeteries of life.''

<HEAD>Civil Rights Nominee `Invisible' on Civil Rights Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee for the nation's
top civil rights job is white, wealthy and not known for quoting
Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
   Even the nominee himself, former state Sen. John Dunne, says
he's no civil rights activist.
   ``Nobody in candor can say I have been an out-front, visible
civil rights activist,'' Dunne, 59, said last week. ``Those who
criticize me for that have a factual basis.''
   But he added, ``While I may not have been leading the charge, I
was certainly among the faithful.''
   On Thursday, Bush nominated Dunne to be assistant attorney
general for civil rights, a post that has been vacant since
December 1988. Bush's first choice, William Lucas, failed to win
Senate confirmation last August.
   Dunne spent 24 years in the state Senate, where he was chairman
of the Judiciary Committee. He resigned in September after losing a
battle for Republican majority leader.
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said that Dunne has been ``invisible'' on civil
rights issues.
   ``I've never seen John Dunne speak out or up on civil rights
matters in any form,'' added Hazel Dukes, president of New York's
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   Dunne's supporters said that in the Republican-controlled state
Senate, it was Dunne who championed confidentiality in AIDS testing
and equality in rates for women seeking to buy insurance.
   ``He's a man of unimpeachable integrity,'' said New York Court
of Appeals Judge Fritz Alexander, a Democrat and the only black
member of New York's liberal top court. ``He's a right thinker in
terms of what needs to be done in society and with civil rights.''
   Some of Dunne's old friends say he is simply a product of his
staunch Republican background. They say that while he's no
hard-core conservative, he's also not a trail blazer _ a sort of
New York version of President Bush.
   Dunne has that dapper country club look. Educated at Georgetown
and Yale Law School, he is a partner in one of New York's major law
firms. He lives in the affluent Long Island community Garden City.
   Until last week, Dunne belonged to a men-only country club. He
ended his 32-year membership in the Garden City Golf Club after it
was reported by his local newspaper. He said his membership was
``inappropriate.''
   While in Albany, Dunne regularly stayed at the exclusive Fort
Orange Club near the Capitol. The club began allowing women members
just last year.
   When inmates took over Attica prison in 1971, they wanted Dunne
to help resolve the crisis. Dunne went to Attica and was highly
critical of then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's handling of the prison's
retaking, during which 39 inmates and guards were killed. Dunne
then helped force changes in the state's prison system.
   It's that sort of thing that's made Dunne something of an
enigma, and his nomination by Bush something of surprise.
   ``It's not that he's bad in these issues, it's that he doesn't
really have a record on them,'' said Thomas Stoddard of the Lambda
Legal Defense Fund, a homosexual rights group. ``On the other hand,
he could have taken a leadership role on civil rights issues and
didn't. He was hardly an advocate.''
   Others see the choice differently.
   ``If the president has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a
more decent person than John Dunne,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, a
New York City Democrat and one of Congress' most influential black
members.
   Rangel said Dunne has the legal experience that Lucas did not.
   A friendship with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh brought
Dunne's name to the attention of the White House. Dunne was an
early supporter of Bush and is close to the president's brother,
New York City investment consultant Jonathan Bush.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Warfare Compared to Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bitter sectarian warfare in Azerbaijan has
a senior Bush administration analyst suggesting the Soviet
government may be mired in a situation comparable to Northern
Ireland or Lebanon.
   ``No political solution is in sight. No military solution is in
sight,'' said one administration source. ``The Caucasian region is
on the way to becoming another Lebanon'' or Northern Ireland.
   Dozens of people have died in the civil warfare in the southern
Soviet republic, where Moslem Azerbaijanis have been fighting
Armenian Christians and the Red Army.
   But administration analysts for the time being have dismissed
one worst-case scenario, in which the violence might spread to
other Moslem areas of the Soviet Union, or beyond.
   A noted non-government analyst on Soviet nationalities said he
did not expect ethnic fighting in Central Asia to reach the
intensity it has in Soviet Caucasia, a mountainous southern region
that includes the republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   But the analyst, Paul Goble, said no end is in sight to the
bloodletting in those three tumultuous republics.
   ``There have been so many deaths in those three republics that
with the tradition of blood feud in the Caucasus _ you killed my
sister, I will now go kill your brother _ you are going to have
constant incidents that will start this up again,'' said Goble, who
recently left the intelligence division of the State Department to
work at Radio Liberty, the U.S.-funded radio station that
broadcasts to the Soviet Union.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev could have prevented much of
the violence if he had quashed early demands by Armenians to take
over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that is populated mostly by
Armenians but is administered by Azerbaijan, said Goble, calling
Kremlin policy on ethnic issues awkward and unenlightened.
   ``It is very frightening, in a sense, given all this ethnic
assertiveness, you have a government in Moscow which is
increasingly out of step with that development,'' Goble told a
small group of reporters recently.
   ``Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader since Lenin never to have
worked in a non-Russian republic a single day in his career, and
the first to come to power ever without a single programmatic
statement on nationality policy,'' he said.
   In Caucasia, even if Gorbachev granted the demand of Azerbaijani
activists to unite as a separate country with ethnic Azerbaijanis
in neighboring Iran, the Soviets likely would face cross-border
fighting between the new nation and Soviet Armenia, both Goble and
a senior administration analyst agreed.
   President Bush, in a news conference on Thursday, said he did
not object to Gorbachev's use of force in Azerbaijan.
   ``I want very much for him to succeed,'' Bush said. ``And I
don't think anyone is faulting him for the difficulties that he has
encountered in Azerbaijan.''
   Azerbaijan is separated from the republics of Central Asia by
the Caspian Sea, but both populations are largely Moslem and speak
dialects of Turkish.
   The Central Asians are unlikely to engage in radical opposition
to Gorbachev because they are very poor and depend on heavy
subsidies from Moscow, said Goble.
   ``In Central Asia, there is absolutely no move toward
independence,'' said Goble.
   ``The fighting probably will not spark unrest in Central Asia,''
said the administration source. ``There are other factors at work
behind discontent'' in the Central Asian republics, he said, citing
high unemployment rates, a shortage of drinking water and a soaring
infant mortality rate.
   The CIA has recently finished a study that reached the same
conclusion, an administration source said.
   The people of Azerbaijan are mostly Shiite Moslems, like the
majority in Iran. Most people in the Central Asian Republics of
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kirghizia and Tadzhikistan speak
different dialects of Turkish and are by and large Sunni Moslems,
like the population of Afghanistan to the south.

<HEAD>Light Industrial Goods Best Prospects for US Export to East Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it may be some time before the dust
settles from political upheavals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union, an Agriculture Department think tank is already looking at
the future of agricultural trade in the region.
   The Centrally Planned Economies Branch of the department's
Economic Research Service used a computer model to estimate what
Eastern Europe may buy and sell in the next decade or so, says an
article in the February issue of Farmline magazine.
   Analysts said that for the region as a whole, the best U.S.
export prospects are textiles, high-value processed foods and
similar ``light'' industrial goods.
   ``By nation (the analysts) expect increased grain purchases by
Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, but average or
less-than-average purchases by the Soviet Union,'' the report said.
   The computer study also indicated ``a general upward trend'' in
oilseed imports by the East Europeans.
   ``Hungary is expected to find it advantageous to export grain
and import livestock, and Yugoslavia could become a livestock
importer,'' the report said. ``Poland and Bulgaria are expected to
increase livestock imports.''
   But the region has many political and economic challenges as the
individual countries _ with the exception of Albania _ adopt some
form of market system and shift away from centrally planned
economies.
   ``Key goals of all the nations are, first, to make their
currencies fully exchangeable with other currencies _ a status
known as convertibility _ and, second, to remove controls over
prices and wages,'' the report said.
   Although some of the countries get around convertibility
problems by using some forms of barter, U.S. businesses prefer hard
currency. As of early January, Hungary, Poland and East Germany
were seen as making the most progress toward convertibility.
   ``The Soviet Union has a two-steps-forward, one-back approach
toward lifting economic controls,'' the report said. ``The USDA
specialists say Moscow appears to be concerned about the
speculative trading opportunities offered by an open marketplace,
and it does not want to be considered an ally of the middleman.''

   Agriculture Department scientists say many
farm crops show good resistance to acid rain and that there is a
possibility of developing even tougher strains.
   A team at the Agricultural Research Service's laboratory in
Raleigh, N.C., exposed 216 varieties of 18 crops to simulated acid
rain many times more acidic than found now in the eastern United
States.
   ``The simulated acid rain caused no significant injury, nor did
it reduce growth in most species,'' the agency said in a report.
   Acid rain contains pollutants from the atmosphere, such as
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide present in exhausts from factory
smokestacks and automobiles. These chemicals make the rain more
acid.
   The experiments were conducted by botanist Denis T. Dubay, plant
pathologist Allen S. Heagle and plant physiologist Walter W. Heck.
   ``Tomatoes, eggplant, snapbeans, cotton, peanuts and soybeans
were the only crops whose leaves showed damage of more than 5
percent after the one-hour exposure,'' the report said. ``The most
sensitive variety of tomato had as much as 24 percent of its leaf
area damaged by the single exposure.''
   But at the other end of the scale, potatoes, corn, lettuce,
winter wheat, orchardgrass, melons, fescue, cucumbers, alfalfa,
clover and squash all had less than 2 percent leaf damage.
   Crops that suffered the greatest damage in the shorter-term
acute tests also registered the most damage in chronic tests for up
to 15 days of simulated acid rain at a time.
   Leaf damage varied greatly by varieties for tomatoes and
soybeans, raising the possibility of breeding hardier strains of
acid-resistant crops if those are needed someday, the report said.

   A trade association says about 75 percent of
the nation's 1990 winter wheat acreage has been put under multiple
peril crop insurance protection, based on preliminary figures.
   Eugene Gantz, executive vice president of the American
Association of Crop Insurers, said large increases in coverage were
reported in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska.
   Overall, an estimated 80 percent of the wheat planted last fall
in Kansas, Nebraska and Texas is insured, and 60 percent in
Colorado and Oklahoma.
   The debate in Congress on new farm legislation includes
controversy about operations of the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. in
the Agriculture Department, which subsidizes multiple-peril
coverage sold to farmers.
   Federal crop insurance is sold by private companies that are
reinsured by FCIC against most losses. So-called master marketers
sell and service policies directly on behalf of the agency.
   Participation in the federal crop insurance program has been
slim in many years, with many farmers preferring to rely on
emergency aid and disaster payments from USDA when drought or other
disasters strike.

   A recently ordained homosexual priest said
he may start his own church if he is forced to resign from the
Episcopal clergy because of his belief that monogamy is unnecessary
for a Christian relationship.
   The Rev. J. Robert Williams resigned Saturday from Oasis, a
church program ministering to homosexuals, but said Sunday he will
remain an Episcopal priest at All Saints Episcopal Church in
Hoboken.
   ``I'm not making a decision to leave the church unless they
force me to leave the church,'' Williams said. ``Before I got
ordained, I was thinking of starting my own church, and that may be
something that I'll have to do after all in order to tell the
truth.''
   Bishop John S. Spong said he will request an investigation of
Williams by the diocese of Newark, and may ask the priest to resign
if he does not agree to uphold the principles of monogamy espoused
by the church.
   Spong, who said the diocese would find a replacement for
Williams in the Oasis program, ordained Williams last month despite
objections of many conservative Episcopalians.
   Williams, a Texas native, provoked further controversy at a Jan.
13 church forum in Detroit by calling monogamy ``as unnatural as
celibacy.'' The comments were carried by the Religious News
Service, the Star-Ledger reported Sunday.
   Spong said in a statement that Williams would not have been
ordained had church officials known of his views on monogamy. He
said officials were unaware of it although Williams had been
screened for ordination for two years.
   ``His own life needs to be conducted according to the same
standards applied to all priests, homosexual or heterosexual,''
Spong wrote. ``If Mr. Williams is not able to conform to the
standards of this diocese, then his resignation would be
requested.''
   Spong said he asked Williams to apologize, but the priest said
he has no intention of changing his views on monogamy.
   Williams said few heterosexual or homosexual couples are
faithful.
   ``I think monogamy is an option,'' he said. ``Some couples
choose it and some couples don't. I believe you can have a
successful and a Christian relationship either way.''
   The priest said he felt that Spong was using him as a scapegoat
for the pressure he was feeling from church authorities over his
ordination.
   Williams has said hundreds of Episcopal priests are homosexual,
but most keep their sexual orientation private. The General
Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979 approved a resolution
saying it is inappropriate for the church to ordain a practicing
homosexual.
   Williams, 34, has lived with James Skelly, 39, a hospital
administrator, for four years.

<HEAD>Third World Debtor Countries Live Better Than Average</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank says people in countries that
have gone deeply into debt enjoy higher living standards than the
average Third World country.
   The bank calculates that Third World countries owe a total of
$1.3 trillion. Some are in trouble with their creditors and have
tried austerity measures to grow out of their difficulties, but
they still seem to be in constant crisis.
   In many ways, however, debt seems to have little effect on their
progress.
   Mexico, the largest Third World debtor after Brazil, has
completed the biggest and most difficult arrangement yet for
reducing the burden of the $104 billion it owes, using the strategy
proposed last year by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   Reduction in the actual debt is expected to be small because
there also will be new lending to Mexico. More important is a
reduction expected in the $7 billion that has been flowing out of
the country every year, mostly as interest and repayment of
principal.
   Compared with many Third World countries, Mexico is fairly well
off, the World Bank found. In 1988 the average Mexican earned the
equivalent of $1,820, compared with $1,970 for what the bank calls
the average middle-income country _ a group that includes such
diverse countries as Malaysia and Poland.
   The bank this week distributed to reporters its ``Social
Indicators of Development.'' The document includes only approximate
dates because some countries compile their figures more quickly
than others, so that the latest statistics available come from
different years, depending on the country.

<HEAD>Rights Group Blames Contras for New Year's Ambush of Nuns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. human rights group's investigation
concludes that Contra rebel forces were responsible for the New
Year's Day ambush and killing of two Roman Catholic nuns, including
an American, in Nicaragua.
   The private human rights group, Americas Watch, said in a
53-page report Sunday that its investigation, which included
numerous interviews and other data obtained in Nicaragua, found
that the ambush was conducted by Contra forces. The report said it
appears the attack was not aimed specifically at the nuns.
   The two nuns, including Sister Maureen Courtney, 45, of
Milwaukee, Wis., were killed when the white pickup in which they
were riding came under attack on a remote highway 165 miles
northeast of Managua. A bishop and another nun survived the attack.
   The Contra rebels have denied any involvement.
   ``It is our conclusion, based on this investigation, that those
responsible were a unit of the rebel Resistencia Nicaraguense, or
Contras, firing indiscriminately at the vehicle without warning to
stop, but also without knowledge that the vehicle belonged to the
church,'' the report by Americas Watch said.
   The group had been asked by five members of Congress to
investigate the shooting.

<HEAD>Report: Barry Paved Way for Rasheeda Moore's No-Bid Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry personally urged Hazel
Diane ``Rasheeda'' Moore in 1986 to seek city funding for a no-bid
contract to teach self-esteem training to inner city youths,
according to a published report.
   Moore's former business partner, Carole Bland Jackson, was
quoted by The Washington Post on Sunday as saying Barry came up
with the idea at a Friday night party in June 1986. Jackson said
she drew up the $52,488 ``Project Me'' program within a day and it
was approved the following Monday. Jackson later became director of
the project.
   At the time, Jackson and others said, Barry was seeking a sexual
relationship with Moore.
   Moore is the woman who allegedly lured Barry to a downtown
Washington hotel on Jan. 18, where the mayor was subsequently
arrested and charged with possession of cocaine. Barry is currently
in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he is undergoing treatment for
chemical dependency.
   Jackson said she and Moore approached Barry at the 1986 party
and asked him to emcee a fashion show. The mayor declined, but
asked the women to come up with a program to supplement his summer
youth program.
   After Jackson devised the ``Project Me'' program, she said Barry
``basically told people'' at the Department of Employment Services
that they should give Moore whatever was needed for the program.
   ``I learned later that there's a process for getting the money
and ours was pushed through,'' Jackson said.

   The real estate agent dubbed ``Robin HUD,'' who
admitted stealing millions in federal housing funds and claimed she
gave much of it to the poor, said she sees prison as a chance to go
to college.
   Marilyn Louise Harrell said she planned to plead guilty today at
the start of her U.S. District Court trial.
   She is accused of stealing more than $5 million in government
funds, lying to federal officials and filing false tax returns.
   ``I don't want to spend taxpayers' money in a court
proceeding,'' the 46-year-old real estate agent from Waldorf, told
The Sun newspaper in a story published Friday.
   Under an agreement with federal prosecutors, Harrell said she
agreed to plead guilty to stealing government property and failing
to report income for taxes.
   In return, she said, prosecutors agreed to drop two other tax
counts, two counts of lying to HUD officials and one count of lying
to a bank on a loan application.
   The two charges she said she would admit to carried a maximum
sentence of 13 years in prison. But she said that under federal
sentencing guidelines, she could serve 2{ to 3 years in prison.
   If convicted on all seven counts, Harrell would have faced up to
31 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines.
   Harrell and her lawyer, Anthony R. Gallagher, have unlisted
telephone numbers and could not be reached for comment Sunday. The
Sun said Gallagher declined to comment Friday.
   U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox declined to comment Sunday.
   Harrell said she hoped to be sentenced to perform community
service but saw prison as a chance to get a college degree.
   ``I told the kids just think of it as Mom going away a few years
for college,'' Harrell said of her son, John, and his wife, Vicki.
   Last year, Harrell told a congressional committee she took
millions in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development money
and used most of it to buy cars and housing for the needy.
   Prosecutors said Harrell took at least $5.67 million from HUD,
money generated by sales of HUD properties that Harrell handled as
a private escrow agent for the agency.
   Prosecutors acknowledged some of the money went to charities,
but alleged she spent most of the money on herself and her family.
   But Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only
$4.75 million in HUD funds and that ``less than 6 percent'' of the
money benefited her family.
   Harrell said she has prepared herself for imprisonment since
1985, when she started diverting HUD funds.
   ``I really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of
my life to help some of the people I've helped,'' she said.
   Harrell, who confessed to government officials in December 1988,
became a symbol of mismanagement at HUD when scandal erupted there
last summer. Following her indictment last November, U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said the case was the largest involving the
theft of federal funds by an individual.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing Nikkei, dollar</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
Monday, while the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 299.63
points, or 0.81 percent, ending at 37,173.70. It had lost 95.04
points Friday.
   The dollar closed at 143.22 yen, down 0.75 yen from Friday's
close of 143.97 yen. It opened at 143.07 yen and ranged between
142.85 yen and 143.23 yen.
   Traders said the dollar opened sharply lower here as it was
buffeted by a worse-than-expected showing of the U.S. gross
national product. It moved narrowly afterwards as market players
made position adjustments, they said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the nation's
gross national product grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of
0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
   Some market analysts predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board would ease its monetary policy to counter the nation's
faltering economy.
   ``The market this week will try to see how far the dollar can go
down,'' said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities, Co. in Tokyo.
   ``But the dollar already fell almost 3 yen from the 146 yen
level last week, it is unlikely to fall further so quickly,'' he
said, adding that the market is watching what U.S. Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan says in speeches scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.
   On the stock market, the index rose as market players were
reassured by the yen's strength and was also helped by index-linked
buyings by speculative investors, dealers said.
   But trading was inactive amid uncertainties over the direction
of U.S. monetary policy, in addition to the major election here
expected next month, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Co.
   ``The Nikkei rose, but market players were just not in a mood to
invest,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   He added that the volume was unusually small for the first day
of February contracts. In stock trading, monthly contracts start
four days prior to the calender month.
   ``The market has cooled down, and it won't change unless these
negative factors disappear one by one,'' the dealer said.

   Family and friends went with the flow
when Bill Heflin and Susan Davis exchanged wedding vows thigh-deep
in a steamy, 110-degree hot tub.
   ``We wanted it to be something special we can look back on and
giggle about,'' Heflin said about Saturday's ceremony under a
gazebo behind his home 25 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   Instead of a tuxedo, the 39-year-old Heflin wore a suit coat,
T-shirt and cut-off suit pants. The bride wore a cream-colored
blouse, a flowered hairpiece and the bottom half of a silk sari
over Lycra shorts.
   ``I wanted to be formal from the waist up, informal from the
waist down,'' said Davis, 35.
   Adding to the atmosphere were fragrant gardenias floating on the
swirling hot tub water, rock music and the wedding march played on
a harmonica by one of Davis' daughters, 9-year-old Jamie.
   ``I thought that maybe he'd lost his marbles,'' said Fay Bryan,
the bride's mother and one of 40 guests. ``I think it's going to be
great for her, though.''

   When the Monroe Township Groundhog
Society members meet, they shake hands and then snort at each other.
   The snort as a form of greeting is no laughing matter to a
society in which members wear fake fur and groundhog hoods with
ears, according to Dr. David Steele, the group's historian.
   The society requires the 18 members to ``pass the snort test and
take at least one snort a year.''
   The society was formed in 1929, but folded in 1935. With the
discovery of some old society papers, the group re-emerged last
January.
   Steele said that many people can't understand why a grown man
wants to become a groundhog member, although the civic group raises
funds for community projects in the central Indiana town about 30
miles northeast of Indianapolis.
   ``Each year we have $1,000 to $1,500 to put back into the
community. At the same time, we get to act silly _ like little
boys,'' he said.
   And to celebrate Groundhog Day in proper style.
   On Friday, at the society's annual ``swill'' breakfast on
Groundhog Day, member Sam Lower will emerge from a groundhog mound
made of pipe, bushes and canvas only after hearing the group's
chant:
   ``Groundhog, groundhog, we must know. Is it spring or is it
snow? Tell us, tell us, we can't wait. Come on out, you reprobate.''

   More than 15,000 Romanians mounted the
largest anti-government rally since last month's revolution,
breaking through a line of soldiers and threatening to ``come get''
the new leader from his headquarters.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, struggling to free his government
from any association with Communism and the ousted Ceausescu
regime, said later Sunday that opposition parties had agreed to
broad talks.
   During the rally outside government headquarters in Victory
Square, protesters said the ruling National Salvation Front should
resign because of its decision last week to compete in elections.
   Many called for opposition participation in the interim
government, claiming the front is not, for example, allowing its
political competitors enough access to broadcast media.
   ``I was in the revolution .... I protected Iliescu and the front
because I thought they were good people. But they are not, they are
liars,'' said Mihai Gheorghescu, an official with the opposition
National Peasants Party.
   The protesters had rushed through a line of armed soldiers and
assembled at the doors of the government headquarters. Some
scurried atop a half-dozen tanks guarding the building.
   The crowd booed Iliescu when he appeared on an upper floor of
the building and tried to speak. The protesters chanted ``Resign!
Resign!'' and ``Get out, or we'll come get you out!''
   Iliescu was named head of a loose coalition of disaffected
Communists and intellectuals who assumed power after the revolt
ousted the 24-year regime of Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed
with his wife, Elena, on Dec. 25.
   But the front has come under intense criticism since announcing
its intention to compete in free elections set for May 20 against
newly formed opposition parties.
   Critics say the front cannot fairly compete in balloting it will
also administer. They note that it contains some former ranking
Communists and contend it supports a return to one-party rule.
   Pro-government demonstrators also crowded around the building
Sunday, chanting ``Iliescu ... We are with you!.'' But they were
outnumbered and out-shouted by the opposition forces.
   The two sides booed and hissed at each other, but there was no
violence. No injuries were reported as the line of soldiers about
75 yards from the building gave way to the crowd. The soldiers then
re-formed their line five deep at the building's entrances.
   After nightfall, truckloads of pro-government demonstrators were
brought to the square, some shouting that the opposition protesters
were ``provocateurs'' and ``gypsies.''
   After the reinforcements arrived, Iliescu reappeared and shouted
over a microphone that the front had met representatives of the
three parties sponsoring the protest.
   ``All the political parties agreed to cooperate, including the
three that sponsored this demonstration,'' Iliescu said. ``Next
week, we will continue the dialogue.''
   He said all of the more than 20 parties seeking to run
candidates in the elections would meet with front leaders Thursday.
   Earlier, a spokesman with the opposition Peasants Party said
that party leaders met Iliescu to demand that the front give way to
a broader-based interim government.
   A small crowd held a separate protest at the headquarters of the
state radio and television building and demanded access to the
media to call for the resignation of the provisional government.
   About 2,000 of the National Salvation Front's backers held
another rally earlier at a nearby district government building,
chanting ``The front is us, and we are the people!''
   Earlier Sunday, Iliescu had criticized the anti-government
demonstrators in a televised speech.
   ``To destabilize the National Salvation Front right now means
destabilizing the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Glitzy Resort Town Gearing up For Fur-Ban Referendum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLEN MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simmering beneath the winter wonderland
facade of this glitzy ski resort town is an emotional issue:
whether to ban the sale of furs.
   Led by the mayor and his wife, animal-rights activists are
urging residents to vote for the citywide ban in a special election
Feb. 13.
   It would be the first time a U.S. city has taken such a step,
says Katharine Thalberg, leader of the Aspen Society for Animal
Rights and wife of Bill Stirling, mayor of this city of 3,500
full-time residents.
   ``Furs are frivolous,'' Stirling said. ``Aspen is not willing to
earn sales tax on an industry based on cruelty.''
   And Aspen, Stirling said, is ``avant-garde'' _ the first
community in the nation to pass an anti-smoking law, to declare
itself a nuclear-free zone and to pass a tax specifically to
finance the acquisition of open space.
   ``I see Aspen again being out there at the head of the pack,''
he said.
   Opponents say the ban would infringe upon consumers' freedom of
choice and could drive away big-spending tourists.
   ``We've made our reputation on tolerance,'' said furrier Mark
Kirkland. ``Now we're wrecking that. ... I've had letters and the
hotels have had guests tell them that if this passes, they'll find
another ski resort to go to.''
   Richard Parsons, executive director of the Washington,
D.C.-based Fur Information Council of America, denied that fur
farms are inhumane in their management of fur-bearing animals. He
sees the issue as a local political question.
   ``It appears the mayor is trying to take his and his wife's
personal moral agendas and legislate them,'' said Parsons. ``Furs
today _ who knows what restaurant they'll tell what to serve
tomorrow.''
   On the ballot with the fur-ban plan is a proposal to scale a $70
million Ritz-Carlton hotel already under construction at the base
of Aspen Mountain. The pro-fur people tend also to be pro-Ritz,
Thalberg says.
   Meanwhile, Stirling and three of the four other City Council
members face a March 13 recall election for their handling of both
issues.
   An underlying factor in the election is ``the resentment of the
incredible wealth that has been pouring in here,'' said Dave
Danforth, publisher of the Aspen Daily News.
   Danforth noted that many Aspen workers are forced to live up to
65 miles away because of escalating real estate prices.
   A popular, somewhat bitter, line in Aspen these days talks about
the ``billionaires driving out the millionaires,'' he said.
   Last year, the average home in the area sold for $1.1 million,
said Gary Feldman, president of the Pitkin County Board of Realtors.
   There are few outward signs here of the heat generated by the
proposed fur ban, aside from some anti-fur posters, calls to radio
talk shows and letters to the editors of the two daily newspapers.
   ``The purchasing of furs has and always will be a marked
distinction of wealth and of those aspiring to wealth, and the ban
of such furs will do nothing but bring ridicule to the economic
aspirations of such a fine cultural resort town,'' wrote Donna
Maier of Denver.
   But Patrice Stinson of Reston, Va., wrote that she ``would love
the opportunity to spend some time in a fur-free city.''
   ``Imagine the increased revenue for your city when anti-fur
animal activists learn that your city is fur-free,'' she wrote.
``We'll have someplace to go that is tailored to our lifestyles and
conforms with our views.''
   Stirling scoffs at claims that the ordinance would keep visitors
away, saying the same arguments were made in 1985 when the town
adopted its strict ban on smoking in restaurants, offices and just
about all buildings except bars and private homes.
   ``Freedom of choice was constantly rearing its head during the
smoking debate, just as it is now,'' Stirling said.
   His wife, who owns a bookstore, predicts the ban will pass. She
notes that in 1986 voters approved an ordinance banning the sale of
furs from animals caught in a leg-hold trap, though it proved
unenforceable.
   ``This ordinance does not prevent the wearing of furs,''
Thalberg said. ``As for selling them, well, trade is not entirely
unrestricted in this country. If society, for whatever reasons,
decides something shouldn't be sold, then legislation is passed. It
is not being shoved down anyone's throat. It's an election.''

<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba, in defiant
rejection of the democratic reforms sweeping other Communist
nations, has declared that his country will stick to orthodox
communism even if Moscow ends all support.
   Castro's remarks in speeches Sunday, quoted in news reports,
represented the first time he has suggested the Soviets might cut
off the assistance that helps power his 31-year-old revolution.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been urging Cuba to
liberalize its political system and Moscow has cut back on aid.
   Castro said he understood that internal problems were leading
the Kremlin to cut back on its $5 billion in annual aid to Cuba, an
apparent reference to separatist movements and economic troubles
plaguing Gorbachev.
   ``The Yankees are euphoric because they believe we will be
isolated and cannot resist. There are even some who have virtually
extended condolences because they believe the revolution will not
survive the changes in the Socialist bloc,'' Castro was quoted as
saying in a speech.
   However, he was quoting as saying Cuba stands ready to live
``under a wartime economy'' if need be. Virtually all of Cuba's
crude oil comes from the Soviet Union at cut-rate prices.
   Castro said he would brook no political liberalization,
rejecting a petition for recognition by an opposition party.
   ``We don't want fifth columns to be created here at a time when
everything is at stake,'' Castro was quoted as saying. He said Cuba
must resist U.S. ``imperialism'' for the sake of all Latin America.
   The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina and the Mexican
government news agency Notimex filed dispatches from Havana on
Castro's remarks, which came in a three-hour speech to 2,500
delegates at the annual congress of Cuba's labor federation and an
address to a rally of 15,000 people protesting U.S. plans for a
television station to beam special programs to Cuba.
   The agencies were monitored in Mexico City.
   ``The (Cuban) Revolution will not back down one millimeter, not
even if it is totally blockaded by the United States or if the
Soviet Union totally cuts off its supplies,'' said Castro.
   ``We have prepared ourselves to engage in the struggle by all
the people in defense of socialism,'' he said, warning that Cubans
may have to tighten their belts and live ``at peace but under a
wartime economy.''
   ``It will not be here where the history of other countries will
be able to repeat itself, and those who want to play at
counterrevolution are going to have to face the people,'' Castro
was quoted as saying in reference to demonstrations that have
overthrown Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   Castro, in power since a popular revoluton ousted dictator
Fulgencio Batista in 1959, has staunchly resisted any talk of
liberalizing his rule.
   The sudden fall of President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania in
December gave rise to speculation that Cuba or Albania would be the
next country to undergo major changes.
   In his remarks on Yankee ``euphoria,'' Castro may have been
referring to reports that the Miami police department has
established a contingency plan to control celebrations by Cuban
exiles if Castro falls.
   The United States imposed a trade and financial embargo on Cuba
more than 20 years ago, accusing the island nation's government of
inciting revolution in other nations.
   In his speech, Castro confirmed reports that his government had
rejected a petition from the Miami-based Christian Democratic Party
to be given legal status and allowed to take part in politics.
   ``The secret of Cuban resistance in these 30 years of revolution
has been the unity of the government, the people and the party, and
a multiparty system would only result in internal weakening,''
Castro was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who
is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday
morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the
official news agency ADN said.
   The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after
being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had
undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
   Honecker was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg
prison, the brief dispatch said. Honecker joins other members of
his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
   Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and
former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with
treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and
state funds.
   Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East
Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously
been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
   ADN said that the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter
Althaus, repeated on Monday that in his opinion Honecker was still
not well enough to be jailed.
   On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison
hospital because of his condition. ADN made not mention if
Rummelsburg prison was equipped with a medical facility.
   Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to
put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the
hospital.

<TEXT>
   Social Democrat Oskar
Lafontaine has risen with an electoral triumph from the shadows of
regional office to position himself as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
challenger in December's federal elections.
   The 46-year-old governor of tiny Saarland state, an
independent-minded leftist, led his party to resounding victory in
regional balloting Sunday, virtually assuring his nomination as the
party's candidate for chancellor.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union was handed the
latest in a string of local setbacks. The Free Democrats, his
centrist partner in the governing Bonn coalition, also lost seats.
   Nationally well-known and respected as a tough career
politician, Lafontaine would be strong opposition in Kohl's bid for
a third four-year term as West German leader.
   Sunday's vote in Saarland was an unexpectedly strong endorsement
for Lafontaine's entry into national politics as his party widened
its absolute majority in the state parliament.
   Lafontaine's campaign focused on the economic and social impacts
of the wave of East Germans resettling in West Germany and the
election's outcome illustrated the public's growing resentment over
the influx.
   The Social Democrats polled 54.4, compared with 33.4 percent for
the Christian Democratic Union and 5.6 percent for the Free
Democrats.
   The environmentalist Greens party polled 2.7 percent, short of
the 5 percent needed to enter the regional parliament. The
ultra-rightist Republicans, making their debut in Saarland,
received 3.3 percent of the vote.
   According to preliminary official results, the Social Democrats
won 30 of the parliament's 51 seats, a gain of four. Kohl's party
won 18, down two, while the Free Democrats dropped from five to
three seats.
   For Kohl, it was a damper after last fall's sudden democratic
changes in East Germany stirred hopes for German reunification and
boosted the chancellor's standing.
   Lafontaine had urged that generous federal and state benefits
for East German immigrants be cut to encourage them to stay at home
and work for democratic change there.
   He said Sunday night that the Saarland vote was a warning to
Bonn.
   ``A majority of the population does not tolerate that one talks
about future forms of statehood but not about current social
problems,'' he told West German television. ``It is nonsensical to
offer bounties for leaving (East Germany).''
   About 47,000 East Germans have fled political and economic
uncertainty in their Communist-led homeland since Jan. 1, and up to
2,500 still arrive daily. Nearly 344,000 migrated to West Germany
last year, putting great strain on social services and housing
markets.
   Lafontaine recently called himself a ``German patriot in the
tradition of enlightenment and tolerance.''
   ``German unity is absolutely no problem, but it must be embedded
in European integration,'' he added Sunday.
   He said he was surprised by the extent of the victory but
refused to comment on a national candidacy. ``The other questions
come later,'' he told West German television.
   Lafontaine already has the informal blessing of his party
chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel to take on Kohl.
   Vogel predicts ``outstanding achievements'' for Lafontaine, who
began a meteoric political career at age 21 in his party's youth
organization. In Saarbruecken, he became the youngest mayor of any
West German city at age 32.
   When he was voted deputy chairman of the Social Democrats in
1987, he had become known as a gadfly opposed particularly to the
party's conservative wing, led by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   Lafontaine vocally opposed plans to station U.S. medium-range
nuclear missiles in West Germany, pushed by Schmidt in the late
1970s.

   Troops early today captured a key
leader in last month's coup attempt, and the military chief said
the arrest would severely weaken efforts to launch a new bid to
topple the government.
   Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, captured outside a house in suburban
Quezon City with two other rebel officers, is believed to be the
most important leader arrested so far in connection with the Dec.
1-9 coup attempt.
   Abenina jumped a fence fleeing the troops but fell and injured a
leg, said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital
Region Defense Command. He then surrendered, Biazon said.
   The two other rebel officers arrested at the hideout were a
major and captain, the military said.
   Biazon accused Abenina of forming the coalition of soldiers and
supporters of the late President Ferdinand Marcos who led the
December attacks, the sixth and bloodiest bid to oust President
Corazon Aquino.
   Abenina was supposed to be a member of the military junta that
would have replaced Mrs. Aquino had the coup succeeded, Biazon said.
   Abenina, a former Philippine Constabulary regional commander,
was believed to be the senior officer in the coup attempt.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 injured in the
failed coup, the most serious effort to topple Mrs. Aquino since
she was swept to power in the civilian-military uprising that
ousted Marcos in February 1986.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said Abenina's
capture showed the determination of the armed forces to arrest
those believed behind the coup attempt.
   ``Abenina's capture will undoubtedly weaken their movement and
further reduce their capability to destabilize society,'' he said.
   De Villa said the arrest was made possible because of ``the
widespread support of concerned civilians'' but gave no details.
The military had offered a $45,500 reward for Abenina's capture.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she was ``very happy and very
pleased'' about Abenina's arrest and said the government would
spare no efforts to capture all rebels still at large.
   Earlier this month, Sen. Joseph Estrada released a letter from
Abenina in which he said the coup participants wanted to eliminate
government corruption and usher in social, economic and political
reform.
   ``The Aquino government has failed,'' Abenina said in the
letter. ``It has failed to govern and ensure the safety and
well-being of its citizens. We need a government that reflects our
virtues.''
   Abenina was also implicated in an August 1987 coup attempt led
by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who remains at
large. Abenina was removed from his command in the central city of
Cebu after that attempt.

<HEAD>Noriega Moved to Isolated Cell in Miami Federal Prison</HEAD>

   Ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega has been
transferred from an apartment-like holding area in the federal
courthouse to an isolated cell in a nearby prison, officials said.
   Noriega, who faces federal drug charges, had been held in the
basement of the the downtown courthouse after being brought to the
United States on Jan. 4.
   He was admitted to Metropolitan Correctional Center 25 miles
south of Miami on Sunday evening, said the warden, Stephen Pontesso.
   The prison is medium security but has some maximum-security
cells.
   Pontesso refused to describe Noriega's quarters in detail,
calling it simply ``a cell.''
   The Miami Hearld today reported that Noriega was placed in a
specially-built large cell in the administration area where at
least one guard will watch him at all times.
   Steven Kollin, a defense attorney, confirmed that his client was
being held separately from the prison's general population.
   Noriega, who has appeared in court in his uniform, wore civilian
clothes and slumped down in the back of a station wagon as he was
driven past the prison entrance.
   He was taken there because it is the standard holding place for
federal prisoners held in south Florida, said Jim Jones, regional
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
   After Noriega was moved, Kollin met with him at the prison.
   ``Our position is that he should not be at MCC,'' Kollin said
afterward. ``He should be at Homestead Air Force Base as a
temporary measure because he is a prisoner of war, and he should be
at Homestead only to await transfer to a neutral third country.''
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered Noriega
held without bond after he and his attorneys refused to participate
at a bail hearing. They said they had sent a letter to Bush
administration officials claiming prisoner of war status for
Noriega, who surrendered two weeks after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion
of Panama.
   Asked about Noriega's disposition, Kollin said his client ``is
hopeful _ and confident _ that our position regarding his
prisoner-of-war status will be upheld.''
   Noriega was indicted in Florida in February 1988 on 12
drug-trafficking counts. His trial is scheduled for March 5.
   Four co-defendants _ former Panamanian Lt. Col. Luis del Cid,
William Saldarriaga, Daniel Mirand and Eduardo Pardo _ also are
being held at the prison, which houses about 1,000 inmates.

<HEAD>Seventh Graders Line up For Chance to Take College Boards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some teen-agers taking the college
boards probably were surprised to see the person in the next chair
had not quite reached puberty.
   More than 35 percent of the 250,000 students who take the
Standardized Achievement Test in January are 12 and 13 years old,
said Roy Nicosia of the Educational Testing Service, which develops
and administers the test.
   The three-hour exam measures aptitude in math, vocabulary,
reading comprehension and grammar and is used by 1,600 American
colleges to help determine admissions, according to ETS.
   Under a program called Project Talent, the test, usually
reserved for juniors, seniors and the occasional sophomore, is open
to seventh graders who excel in their schools.
   Whiz kids who score well on the test get to take advanced
classes during summer school.
   ``I'm a little nervous because I just feel I'm going to do bad,
because it's for older kids, and I'm not going to be able to do
it,'' said Jennifer Twomey, 12, a seventh grader at the Lincoln
Middle School in Brookline.
   Jennifer, who took the test Saturday, qualified for the talent
search by scoring among the top 3 percent on an achievement test
the town requires of its sixth graders, said Pam Capece, a Lincoln
guidance counselor.
   ``I didn't even know people took the SATs when they were in
seventh grade,'' Jennifer said. ``When I found out about it I was
excited. I wanted to see if I could do it.''
   Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore coordinates the talent
search for 19 states in the Northeast and District of Columbia.
Duke University, the University of Colorado and Northwestern
University cover gifted students from the rest of the country.
   Linda Barnett, director of talent identification at Hopkins,
said most of the seventh graders take the test simply to see how
they do.
   ``It doesn't carry the same kind of pressure that a junior or
senior would feel. It's not going to affect whether they get into
college,'' she said.
   That's not to say 12-year-olds are too young to start thinking
about college. The program was designed to better prepare the
brightest students for the rigors of higher education, she said.
   ``We want them to start thinking about it so when they are
juniors or seniors they don't say `Omigosh, why didn't I take more
math?''' Barnett said.
   Not everyone agrees with that philosophy. Jennifer was one of 12
students eligible for the program from Lincoln, but not all
qualified students participate, Capece said.
   ``It's a very hard test,'' said Capece. ``It's extremely
difficult, and a lot of children's parents don't want to subject
their kids to standardized testing that they don't have to be a
part of.''
   Jennifer said she was getting some tips from her 16-year-old
sister Angela, a student at Brookline High School, who also took
the test Saturday.
   ``She said, `You'll probably do better than me because you're so
smart,''' Jennifer said. Asked who she thought would do better,
Jennifer said her sister likely would ``because she's learned most
of the stuff.''
   The top score possible in each of the two categories on the
SATs, verbal and math, is 800. The average college-bound senior
male scores 430 verbal and 500 math, while average juniors and
seniors score lower, said Barnett.
   If the youngsters score as high as the average junior or senior,
they get citations, awards and the chance to go to career symposia
or one-day seminars in humanities and math, Barnett said.
   Those who score as high as the average college-bound senior male
get to go to three-week summer sessions in five locations
throughout the country, as well as Geneva, Switzerland. They take
high school math and sciences, or some college courses in language,
Barnett said.

<HEAD>Rain Drenches South; Snow Falls in Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain dampened parts of the South early today, and snow fell in
Pennsylvania and Indiana.
   On Sunday, snow fell across the Northwest and the Rockies.
   Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Alabama all reported rain
early today. Rain also drenched Cincinnati.
   Snow advisories were posted today for southern Illinois,
northeast Ohio, western Maryland, much of West Virginia,
northwestern Virginia and northern Delaware.
   Winter storm watches were posted for tonight over much of
eastern and central Pennsylvania, a large part of New York state
and Vermont.
   By Sunday evening, a cold front reached from the Atlantic across
southern Delaware, southwest Virginia, northwest Alabama, northwest
Louisiana, and the central Texas Gulf Coast.
   Snow fell over south-central and southwest Pennsylvania, western
Maryland, West Virginia, southern Ohio, southern Indiana, northern
Kentucky and southwest Illinois.
   In southeastern Louisiana, floods that damaged at least 850
homes began to recede Sunday, but a threat of further flooding
remained.
   A 50 percent chance of rain was forecast for today around Baton
Rouge, which was hardest hit by flooding.
   Bertha Helmke of Baton Rouge recalled how she helped haul her
family's belongings out of her home Friday and then sat back and
watched the water pour in for the third time in 13 years.
   ``Throughout the whole thing I didn't shed a tear, but now it's
all hitting me,'' Helmke said. ``You just feel like you're at God's
end. I don't know what to do.''
   In the West, a storm lashed Oregon on Sunday with strong winds
and heavy rain to coastal areas and a foot of snow to the Cascades.
Gusty winds knocked tree limbs into a power line near the studios
of KVAL-TV in Eugene, interrupting broadcast of the Super Bowl for
40 minutes.
   By afternoon, about a foot of blowing, drifting snow had fallen
in the mountain passes of Washington state in 24 hours. Interstate
90, the state's major east-west highway, was temporarily closed
because of avalanche danger.
   Rain or snow was forecast for most of the state today and
Tuesday.
   Rain also fell Sunday on northwest California.
   The Northeast basked in warm weather Sunday. Record highs for
the date were set in New York, where temperatures reached 58
degrees, and in Caribou, Maine, at 42 degrees.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 84 degrees at Naples, Fla.

   Funeral services were held for Edward
C. Corrigan on the fourth anniversary of the Challenger explosion
that killed his daughter, school teacher-astronaut Christa
McAuliffe.
   At Sunday's funeral at St. Jeremiah's church, music was played
on a carillon that had been donated in McAuliffe's memory.
   Corrigan, who died Thursday, had worked tirelessly in the years
the explosion to keep his daughter's memory alive.
   ``It is ironic that the date that was the saddest day in Ed's
life now marks his entry into the eternal joys of heaven,'' said
the Rev. James Leary, of Bristol, Conn., who was a cousin of
Corrigan.
   Corrigan, a retired accountant, was 67 when he died after a long
bout with cancer.
   About 450 people attended the Roman Catholic service.
   McAuliffe, from Concord, N.H., and six other crew members of the
Challenger died in the explosion seconds after the Jan. 28, 1986,
liftoff.
   Leary said the faith of Corrigan and his wife, Grace, helped
carry them through the tragedy of losing a daughter.
   ``They did not allow it to crush their spirit,'' he said.
   Stephen Corrigan, a son, said his parents ``had been traveling
around the country, trying to convey the same message that Christa
did about the importance of education.''
   Corrigan is also survived by another son and two daughters.

<HEAD>Delta, American Jets Grounded By Smoke in Cabin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delta Air Lines jet that had taken off once
and returned to the airport because of an engine warning light was
evacuated during another takeoff try when smoke blew into the
cabin, authorities said.
   Only minor injuries were reported when passengers slid down
emergency chutes in Sunday's evacuation of the Boeing 727.
   Smoke also blew into the cabin of an American Airlines DC-10
flying from Dallas to Los Angeles on Sunday night, and the plane
was diverted to Phoenix, an airline official said. None of the 239
passengers aboard was injured.
   In Tampa, the pilot of Delta Flight 606, carrying 114 passengers
and eight crew members, was making his third attempt to fly to
LaGuardia Airport in New York when smoke was detected, Delta
spokesman Sam Murphy said.
   He said the source of the smoke was under investigation.
   The plane first tried to take off 2{ hours earlier, but an oil
warning light lit up while it was taxiing on the runway and the
pilot returned to the departure gate, Murphy said.
   Maintenance workers fixed the problem and the plane took off
about a half-hour later, but the same warning light on another
engine prompted the pilot to head back to the airport, Murphy said.
   As he prepared for landing, the pilot shut off the engine and
dumped most of the jet's fuel in the Gulf of Mexico, airport
spokesman Paul MacAlester said. He said dumping fuel is standard to
lessen the chances of fire from landing trouble.
   After the jet landed safely, maintenance workers changed the oil
filters in the two other engines and the plane prepared to take off
an hour later, Murphy said.
   The plane was taxiing when smoke blew from air-conditioning
ducts into the passenger cabin, Murphy said.
   ``People were grabbing at the oxygen masks,'' said Christen
Cashman, 21, a student at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
   ``I wasn't really that nervous because there was a businessman
next to us and he told us it was no big deal and these things
happen all the time. Then we lined up and went down the evacuation
chute.''
   The flight then was canceled.
   On the American flight, a loss of oil pressure in one of three
engines caused smoke that the plane's air-conditioning system
sucked into the cabin, said an airline official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said the smoke dissipated when the engine was shut
down, but the plane landed at Phoenix International Airport.

   Jack Iams, a journalist, novelist and editor
whose career spanned more than half a century, has died of a
stroke. He was 79.
   Iams died Saturday while en route to New York from London with
his wife, Joan Walker Wenning Iams.
   Samuel Harvey Iams Jr., was born in Baltimore in 1910. After
graduating from Princeton University, he became a reporter for the
Daily Mail of London.
   Iams also wrote for Newsweek and the Daily News of New York, was
television critic for The New York Herald Tribune, and was an
editor of Atlas Magazine, which is now known as the World Press
Review.
   An author of comic and mystery novels, he wrote 13 books,
including his 1939 novel, ``Table for Four,'' which The New York
Times Book Review said was ``as brilliantly witty as the best of
the British brand.''
   Iams had moved 18 years ago to Opio in southern France, where he
continued writing, but he and his wife sold their house and were
returning to the United States when he died.
   He is survived by his wife and three children by his first
marriage: John, a Moscow correspondent for The Associated Press;
David, a society reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer; and Alice
Kittredge of Panama. There are four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Carter: Sandinistas Agree U.S. Congressmen May Watch Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government, in
a policy reversal, has agreed to let U.S. congressmen monitor
national elections set for February, former President Jimmy Carter
says.
   In addition, Carter said Sunday, U.S.-backed Contra rebels have
agreed to end all attacks on government forces to let the electoral
process move forward smoothly. He said they made the pledge at a
meeting with him.
   In another development, four former rebel leaders returned
Sunday and announced their intention to give up the armed struggle
and join the political process in what they called a more
democratic Nicaragua.
   On Saturday, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the opposition
presidential candidate, demanded the vote count in the Feb. 25
elections be conducted in public, saying she fears the Sandinistas
are planning fraud.
   She made the demand during a rally attended by about 10,000
people in the northern town of Esteli, the largest campaign
gathering yet by the U.S.-backed United National Opposition.
   Carter also said that an agreement was signed Sunday to expedite
the release of money approved by the U.S. Congress for the 14-party
opposition coalition. The congress appropriated $9 million in
October.
   The former president has been invited to observe the general
elections. He is chairman of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of
Government, a group of former chief executives of the Western
Hemisphere.
   President Daniel Ortega, who is seeking another six-year term,
had vowed not to allow any U.S. congressmen into Nicaragua as
official electoral observers and had denied such requests in recent
months.
   Ortega said continued U.S. non-lethal aid for the Contra rebels
indicated the United States did not support the Nicaraguan
elections.
   But Carter said the government had changed its mind and decided
to allow up to 12 members of Congress to serve as observers if they
came as part of the Carter group. He did not give further details.
   The election is seen partly as a referendum on a decade of
Sandinista rule, but the government has charged that the Contras
are trying to sabotage the campaign by attacking Sandinista
activists in the countryside.
   Carter, who spoke at a news conference, said: ``I think that
both the Contra presence in Nicaragua and the Contra military
actions in Nicaragua are very damaging to the electoral process.
Two days ago, I met with Contra leaders in Atlanta and asked them
to do everything possible not to interfere with the electoral
process, to minimize any violence. They gave me their assurance.''
   He said he met with Comandante Franklyn, the nom de guerre of
the Contras' supreme commander in Honduras; Comandante Blas, the
Miskito Indian leader among the rebels; and Dr. Henry, another
Contra leader.
   The four former Contra leaders who returned Sunday accepted a
government amnesty in exchange for moving their struggle from the
battlefield to the political arena.
   ``We came to contribute to peace. We believe that we should no
longer continue the bloodbath among Nicaraguans,'' Diogenes
Hernandez Membreno told reporters on arrival at Managua's airport.
   He was accompanied by Tirso Moreno, Cesar Chavarria and Victor
Sanchez Herdocia.
   The four held important military positions in the Nicaraguan
Resistance heirarchy, but since the end of 1988 have opposed Col.
Enrique Bermudez, the Contra military chief.
   In recent months, numerous former Contra leaders have returned
to Nicaragua. Thousands of other Contras remain in camps in
Honduras.

   The FBI's focus on an Enterprise
businessman in its investigation of two mail-bomb slayings prompted
an insurance company to change its advertising plans during the
Super Bowl.
   The opening scene of New York Life Insurance Co.'s 30-second
television spot during Sunday's game was to have focused on a water
tower bearing the message ``Welcome to Enterprise, Alabama, City of
Progress.''
   But publicity stemming from the FBI investigation prompted the
decision to drop that scene.
   The commercial featured New York Life Agent Fred D. Donaldson,
63, of Enterprise and his three sons, who are all also agents; and
some of Donaldson's clients, the Gibbs McCormick family of New
Brockton.
   Donaldson said he was disappointed but not surprised that the
company changed the ad because of the probe into the December
bombing deaths of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance of suburban
Birmingham and Robert Robinson, a black lawyer in Savannah, Ga.
   ``We took part in the advertisement hoping there would be some
favorable publicity for Enterprise,'' said Donaldson, who has been
a New York Life agent for nearly 42 years.
   ``I was pleased they ran the ad at all,'' he said. ``We felt
good about it that they ran the ad after having to make changes at
this late date.''
   Ben Barron, director of advertising for the company, said the
decision to air the commercial, at a cost of $700,000 during the
Super Bowl, was made Tuesday.
   Donaldson said the deletion of the original opening scene was
prompted by ``bad timing,'' not at the request of the FBI or Robert
Wayne O'Ferrell, the Enterprise salvage dealer who authorities have
investigated intensely since early last week.
   O'Ferrell, who has not been charged, went to church Sunday and
said later: ``Pray for the FBI, that they will find who they are
looking for. And it sure ain't me.''
   Enterprise Mayor Jacquelyn Thompson said Sunday the purpose of
the ad remained the same although it was refocused.
   ``True, we would have like for the ad to have opened with the
original scene,'' she said. ``But the real purpose was to honor the
Donaldson family for what they've done for our community and the
company.''
   Ms. Thompson sees some good coming from the intense media focus
on the city of 19,000.
   ``A lot of media people have told me they have a different
opinion now of a small south Alabama town,'' she said. ``Some
thought we were a bunch of rednecks. This case is the price we pay
for people to see we're not a bunch of rednecks.''

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Explodes at Pro-IRA Event, Killing Teen-Ager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The IRA apologized for a
bomb that killed a teen-ager and injured eight other people during
a parade attended by supporters of the guerrilla group.
   The Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust the British
from Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombing
and said it regretted the death of the bystander, which it called a
``freak accident.''
   The bomb was intended to kill security forces monitoring the
Bloody Sunday anniversary march by Republican supporters, the IRA
said.
   Bloody Sunday occurred on Jan. 30, 1972, when British troops
shot and killed 14 people during a Roman Catholic civil rights
march.
   Police today identified a teen-ager killed Sunday as Charles
Love, 16, of Londonderry. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the
blast also injured four police officers, a soldier and three
civilians.
   A spokesman for the constabulary, which serves as the provincial
police, said the IRA claim of a ``freak accident'' was ``another
example of their nauseating hypocrisy.''
   ``No one can be in any doubt that the sole responsibility for
the events which led to the death of Charles Love rests with the
IRA terrorists,'' said the spokesman, who was not identified in
keeping with British tradition.
   ``They have yet again demonstrated their willingness to plant
bombs without regard for anyone, friends or so-called foe alike,''
the spokesman said.
   The IRA placed the bomb beside a monument regularly used as a
vantage point by security forces. The constabulary spokesman said
the teen-ager had been standing nearby waiting for the parade to
pass.
   Police said the youth died in the hospital from head injuries
when he was struck by masonry falling from a wall.
   They said none of the marchers, who support British withdrawal
from Northern Ireland, was injured and the parade continued through
the city's largely Roman Catholic Bogside and Creggan areas.
   In October, the IRA issued a statement of regret when its gunmen
mistakenly killed a British serviceman's infant daughter in West
Germany. The 6-month-old girl was with her parents in their car
when gunmen attacked, killing the father and child.
   The month before, the IRA said it mistakenly killed the wife of
a British soldier stationed in West Germany. It said the gunman
mistook the woman for a soldier.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent
Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Here is the budget message of President Bush
sent to Congress on Monday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>To the Congress of the United States:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I have the honor to present the Budget of the United States
Government for Fiscal Year 1991.
   The American economy is now in its eighth consecutive year of
expansion and growth. It is essential that the growth of the
economy continue and increase in the future. The budget is designed
to achieve that goal.
   The budget has five broad themes:
   _Investing in Our Future: With an eye toward future growth, and
expansion of the human frontier, the budget's chief emphasis is on
investment in the future. It proposes: a capital gains incentive
for long-term private investment and new incentives for family
savings; record-high amounts for research and dveelopment, space,
education and Head Start; a major investment in civil aviation; and
a large increase in spending to attack the scourge of drugs. At the
same time, the budget maintains a strong national defense while
reflecting the dramatic changes in the world political situation
that are taking place; and it fulfills responsiblities to protect
the environment, and preserve America's cultural heritage.
   _Advancing States as Laboratories: The budget recognizes the
emergence of new ideas and initiatives originating at the state and
local level. The federal government will foster innovation and
experimentation in numerous fields, from transportation to health,
through waivers of certain rules and regulations, and through
demonstration grants.
   _Reforming Mandatory Programs: Entitlement and other mandatory
spending now constitutes nearly half the budget, not counting an
additional 14 percent for interest. The budget provides for full
payment of Social Security benefits and funds growth in health, low
income and other mandatory programs. However, it proposes reforms
where warranted to slow the growth in some of these programs and
thus leave more more in the budget for priority initiatives.
   _Acknowledges Inherited Claims: The budget faces up to such
inherited claims as the cleanup of decades-old environmental damage
at nuclear weapons facilities. It analyzes potential claims from
unfunded annuities and federal insurance programs. It assess the
growing volume of defaults in federal credit programs and proposes
essential credit reforms.
   _Managing for Integrity and Efficiency: The budget contains
suggestions for reforms in the way Congress deals with the budget.
It provides more resources and suggests improved methods for
managing the vast federal enterprise better. It identifies
low-return domestic discretionary programs where a smaller
investment of budgetary resources is warranted.
   The budget meets the deficit target of $64 billion for 1991
established by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, without raising
taxes. It would balance the budget by 1993 as required by that law,
begin reducing debt, and protect the integrity of Social Security.
   Each of the themes outlined above is discussed in more detail in
Section One of the Budget, the Overview. The customary tabular and
appendix material is contained in Section Two.
   I look forward to working with the Congress in the weeks and
months ahead to produce a budget that meets the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target, advances the nation's essential
interests, and keeps the economy on the path of continued growth.

   A police officer who shot an unarmed teen-ager
to death was suspended without pay, authorities said.
   Officer Hyda Hernandez, 25, was suspended Sunday while
authorities investigate the shooting of Louis Liranso, 17, in the
New York City borough of Brooklyn, police said.
   Patrick Clark, a spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles J. Hynes, said the case would be brought before a grand
jury this week. Police shootings are routinely taken before grand
juries.
   The shooting occurred early Saturday evening, when police
responded to a report that four men with guns were in a dispute in
front of a Chinese restaurant.
   Officers found Liranso and a man with an injured knee, Hector
Lopez, 25, at the scene.
   When they began to search Liranso, the youth made a quick
jerking motion and Hernandez, thinking he was pulling out a weapon,
shot him once in the back, according to Mary Wrensen, a police
spokeswoman.
   However, several witnesses said Hernandez was taking Liranso
into the restaurant when he tripped and she shot him.
   ``The cops said `freeze,' and he put his hands up,'' said
13-year-old Mark Facul, a cousin of Larinso. ``He tripped on a step
and she shot him.''
   Liranso was not armed, and was dead on arrival at Woodhull
Hospital.

<HEAD>Airline Safety Analyst Says 707 Fuel Gauges Aren't Highly Accurate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pilot of older jetliners says fuel gauges on
airplanes like the Boeing 707 that crashed on New York's Long
Island are not highly accurate, especially when tanks are low and
fuel is sloshing around.
   ``You could not trust them below 10,000 pounds (of fuel),'' said
John Nance, a former Braniff pilot. Nance, who lives in Tacoma, is
an airline safety analyst.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating
the crash, has said gauges recovered from the wreckage of the
23-year-old plane indicate the plane had about 10,000 pounds of
fuel, perhaps enough to keep it aloft the 15 miles from the crash
site to its destination, John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Investigators caution, however, that the fuel estimate could be
wrong.
   The Avianca airliner crashed Thursday night in the affluent
community of Cove Neck, N.Y., killing 73 people and injuring 85.
Because of the absence of engine noise before the crash, the lack
of fuel odor and the lack of fire after the crash, investigators
focused from the start on the possibility the airliner ran out of
fuel.
   Nance said that with small amounts of fuel on older jetliners,
including the 707 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-8, gauges reading
the fuel splashing around in the several tanks were ``all over the
map. You really don't know what you've got.''
   He said that ``to burn under 10,000 pounds is a dangerous
procedure. To burn below 5,000 is an emergency.''
   Boeing officials have said they don't know of any problems with
fuel gauges on 707 airliners, few of which are still in use by
United States airlines.
   Spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday that each airline provides its
own flight manuals to pilots for instruction on methods to check
fuel levels.
   Airplane manufacturers are required to calibrate gauges before
delivering planes, he said. After that, however, the worthiness of
the gauges is up to the airlines and federal regulators.
   Nance, who still flies as a heavy jet commander with the Air
Force Reserve, said he never flew in Boeing 707s but did pilot
DC-8's, which have similar fuel gauges.
   While the gauges lack accuracy, he said, the equipment
represented the known technology at the time the planes were built,
beginning in the 1950s. Newer-generation jetliners, he said, have
much more accurate fuel gauges.
   ``On the older DC-8's, the gauges were so unreliable that we
were directed by Braniff to disregard them totally and keep a
fuel-burn chart,'' he said.
   Jetliners are equipped with fuel-flow gauges that measure the
amount of fuel being burned at any given time, he said, and a
flight engineer's job includes keeping track of fuel flow and fuel
used.
   ``I would always want to make sure that I started (a flight)
with a known quantity, and keep track of the fuel burn. I would
never depend just on the fuel gauges,'' he said.
   He said 707 flight crews are aware of the system's limitations,
and become familiar with each airplane's idiosyncrasies. He noted
that Avianca has been flying the 707 for some time, and its staff
would presumably know the aircraft. He said any number of scenarios
could have taken place Thursday evening, but that the crew might
not have looked at the instruments, might have seen the wrong
indications on the gauges and believed them, or might have
misinterpreted the gauges. The crew told controllers the plane was
low on fuel but did not formally declare a fuel emergency.
   Nance cited the case of a United Air Lines flight into Portland,
Ore., in December 1978. The DC-8 ran out of fuel and crashed,
though the gauges indicated the plane had 4,000 pounds of fuel
left. Fewer than a dozen died.

<HEAD>New Allegation of Mayor's Drug Use Raised</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former business associate of Hazel Diane
``Rasheeda'' Moore, central figure in the drug case against
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, says she and others snorted cocaine
with Barry at a party in 1986.
   Carole Bland Jackson said in weekend interviews that she snorted
the drug with Ms. Moore and Barry at the party in August 1986, two
days before the two women received a no-bid a contract to work with
the city's summer youth employment program.
   Moore, 38, lured Barry to a downtown hotel of Jan. 18, where he
was arrested on a misdemeanor drug-possession charge after
allegedly smoking crack cocaine.
   Jackson told The Washington Post that ``everybody was using''
the drug at the party at a Washington condominium with the
exception of Moore's sister. She said Moore and Barry eventually
went into the bedroom, and that Barry tried to get her to join them
in their sexual activity.
   The story was first reported on Sunday night by television
stations WJLA and WRC.
   Barry entered a substance abuse clinic, the Hanley-Hazelden
Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Jan. 22 and is to undergo
weekly court-ordered urine tests there, according to court records.
   Barry was scheduled for a Feb. 5 hearing before U.S. Magistrate
Deborah Robinson, but prosecutors have said they do not oppose
postponement of that session while the mayor is at a treatment
center. No new date has been set.
   In another development, a key witness in the probe of alleged
cocaine use by Barry and his friend, Charles Lewis, has been
subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury, federal
officials said.
   James P. McWilliams, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S.
Virgin Islands and now an official of the District of Columbia
Department of Public Works, could testify by midweek, officials
told The Washington Times.
   McWilliams is expected to be asked about whether Barry and Lewis
used drugs at a Washington hotel in December 1988 and on whether
Barry used drugs during visits to the Virgin Islands, the newspaper
said.
   Barry reportedly has denied under oath jury that he ever used
drugs, but Lewis has testified that McWilliams paid $140 for the
crack smoked by Lewis and Barry.
   McWilliams' attorney, Daniel Masur, has denied charges that his
client supplied the money for the crack and said McWilliams was
never involved in any drug transactions.

<HEAD>Pope Tells Burkina Faso Catholics to Resist Contraception</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with pope's remarks in Burkina

^By STEPHEN R. WILSON</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II told Roman
Catholics today to resist abortion and contraception as they try to
improve living conditions in this impoverished West African country.
   Celebrating Mass outside the capital at a national pilgrimage
site, the pope said the church and its members should work to build
up the country ``on the basis of respect for the human person and
the family.
   ``Human life is inviolable, the right to life should be defended
ceaselessly,'' John Paul said.
   He said life should be protected ``from conception until natural
death'' and that couples should live ``a responsible fatherhood and
motherhood.''
   He said couples must resist ``invasion of methods which go
against the dignity of the woman and do not honor the man. I appeal
to all lay people to fight for the sanctification of the family.''
   The Roman Catholic Church rejects artificial birth control and
the church here has resisted government birth control plans.
   The pope arrived here from Mali on the fourth leg of an
eight-day tour of five African nations. About 9 percent of Burkina
Faso's 8.5 million people are Roman Catholics, more than a third
are Moslems and most of the rest are animist.
   On his way from the airport to the Mass site, the pope's
motorcade passed tens of thousands of people gathered by the
roadside in front of thatched huts and concrete hovels. A steady
wind from the Sahara desert blew sand and dust.
   The country has been blighted by drought and expanding desert
and the average per capita income is around $200.
   John Paul was greeted upon arrival from Mali by President Blaise
Compaore, who took power in a 1987 coup in which his predecessor,
Thomas Sankara, was killed.
   Africa is Catholicism's fastest growing church, with more 75
million adherents. The Vatican expects to count 100 million African
faithful by the year 2000.
   However, Islam is a major challenger for converts, and the
Catholic church is increasingly worried by the spread of Islamic
fundamentalism in some areas of Africa.
   In Mali, the pope celebrated a Mass attended by 15,000
Christians and 10,000 Moslems.
   ``I rejoice that a climate of understanding reigns between the
Moslem and Catholic communities in Mali,'' the pope said in his
homily during the Mass at Bamako's soccer stadium. ``Dialogue
between Moslems and Christians is more necessary than ever.''
   As the pope toured the stadium in an open Mercedes, both Moslems
and Catholics stood, waved and cheered.
   About 1 percent of Mali's 8 million people are Catholics, while
Moslems account for 70 percent. Most of the rest are animists.
   ``I hope that the dialogue between Moslems and Catholics
improves even more and favors constructive cooperation,'' John Paul
said.
   Earlier in the day, the pope spoke of the church's concern over
intolerance toward Catholics in some other countries in Africa
without naming any individual nations.
   He also urged Catholics to recognize and respect ``the authentic
religious values'' of Moslems.
   ``Dialogue with them is not always easy or desired by everyone,
and it is sometimes difficult to find a common language or
representatives to talk to each other,'' he said in a speech to
Mali's bishops.

   A Colorado man was charged with murder in a
hit-and-run driving case in which he allegedly made a U-turn across
a road divider so he could chase down a pedestrian and kill him.
   George Thomas Kohoutek, 38, of Aspen, Colo., was being held
without bail today in a Dallas jail.
   Kahoutek was arrested Sunday after police concluded that his
rented red Jeep was the car used to kill Rafael Caracheo, 26, who
police believe was struck intentionally by a hit-and-run driver on
a Dallas street Saturday morning.
   Witnesses said the driver of a late-model red Jeep Cherokee made
a U-turn after passing Caracheo on a street, then drove over the
median into oncoming traffic, sped up and ran him down.
   Caracheo was dragged on the Jeep's hood more than 100 feet
before being thrown into a street sign, police said.
   Lt. William Craven of the department's hit-and-run division said
a phone tip led police to Kohoutek, who has been convicted twice of
driving while intoxicated.
   Police said they don't know if Kohoutek knew Caracheo.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's unveiling of his 1991 budget
proposal today sets off a legislative process that is outlined in
law but still allows for months of delay, finger-pointing and
confusion.
   Bush's $1.23 trillion spending blueprint lays out the
president's priorities for the coming year. He wants to increase
federal efforts on space, science, environmental and anti-drug
efforts while trying to shrink the deficit without a broad tax
increase. N
   Now Congress gets its chance to make the changes it wants, and
the process slows to a crawl.
   Deadlines will be missed, and lawmakers and the White House will
blame each other for it. Virtually every committee in Congress will
get involved, often working in opposing directions. Each side will
accuse the other of using unrealistic numbers, and at year's end a
growing dynamic will be everybody's desire to simply go home.
   The budget year is already getting off to a late start with
today's presentation of the spending plan. It is supposed to be
released on the first Monday after Jan. 3, but the White House and
Congress agreed to an extension.
   Between now and the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1991, a host of other
deadlines will be missed as well. The reason: the budget is an
extremely important political document, and lawmakers see the
fiscal choices they must make as primary. There are no consequences
for missing the deadlines anyway.
   ``This is one of the most difficult budget years we've had in
terms of trying to make ends meet with this process,'' Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee, said late last week.
   Domenici's prediction was founded on the expectation that there
will be several time-consuming, partisan budget battles this year.
   Should easing tensions with the Soviet Union translate into
Pentagon spending cuts, and where should those savings go? How will
the Republicans thwart Sen. Daniel Moynihan's efforts to cut Social
Security taxes?
   Will Bush finally get his capital gains tax cut, and if so what
will the Democrats demand in return? And where will Congress and
the administration find the $36.5 billion in savings they need to
pare the deficit to $64 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law?
   The law calls for the House and Senate to approve a budget
blueprint by April 15, a document that does not require the
president's signature. A measure imposing new taxes and fees and
spending cuts must be completed by June 15. Thirteen separate
spending bills, providing money for federal agencies and programs,
are supposed to be enacted by Oct. 1, an event that has occurred
only once since 1976.
   While all this is going on, Congress will be grumbling about the
administration's economic forecast, which by law is used in the
budget process.
   Those projections _ prepared by the Office of Management and
Budget _ are generally believed by lawmakers to be too rosy. The
healthier the economy, the more revenue the government can estimate
it will collect, and the easier its deficit-reduction job seems.
   But by Aug. 15 the administration will update its forecast, and
if the economy is souring Congress would suddenly be faced with
finding even more savings than it thought were needed. If by Oct.
15 legislators and the president have not agreed to enough
reductions to meet the Gramm-Rudman shortfall target, the law
automatically triggers enough spending cuts to satisfy the target.
   This mix will be confused further by one more event: the
expiration of the government's legal authority to borrow money,
which should occur sometime in September. The law extending the
government's $3.1 trillion debt limit will likely attract all sorts
of controversial items because of its must-pass nature.
   Congressional leaders hope to complete the year's work by early
October, this being an election year. Whether they succeed, or
whether a special post-election session is needed, is likely to
depend on whether budget business is completed in time.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved the drug fluconazole as an alternative treatment for two
fungal infections that afflict patients with AIDS, cancer and other
diseases that weaken the immune system.
   The drug can be used for treating cryptococcal meningitis, an
inflammation of the brain and nervous system that can be fatal.
   It also was approved for treating candidiasis, an infection that
causes sores in the mouth and throat. The infection is present in
80 percent to 90 percent of AIDS patients in advanced stages of the
disease.
   Other drugs are available to treat these infections, but they
can cause serious adverse reactions, the FDA said.
   Fluconazole can also cause side effects, including abdominal
discomfort, nausea and, less commonly, signs of liver damage. In
rare cases, the drug has been associated with severe skin rashes
and fatal hepatic necrosis, a form of liver failure, the FDA said.
   The drug will be marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the trade name
Diflucan.

   The government is considering
delaying Nelson Mandela's release from prison and slowing reforms
because of concerns about current unrest, newspapers said today.
   An aide to Mandela said the black leader will continue his
anti-apartheid fight if substantial reforms are not made, even if
it means spending more time in custody.
   Mandela has been in prison since 1962 and is serving a life term
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   The South African media have been swamped with reports and
speculation on when Mandela might be released. The government has
said it intends to free him but has not said when.
   Several newspapers said today the white-led government is
thinking of keeping Mandela in jail at least until March because of
renewed unrest, such as demonstrations against a tour by English
cricket players defying a ban on sports contacts with South Africa.
   Government leaders are concerned that releasing Mandela and
introducing other reforms would spur unrest, and they want to hold
off on changes to be sure they retain control of developments, the
reports said, citing unidentified sources.
   In addition, The Star newspaper said President F.W. de Klerk
does not want to legalize Mandela's African National Congress
movement _ a condition set by Mandela for accepting freedom.
   De Klerk is expected to outline government reforms Friday in a
speech at the opening of the new session of Parliament. He has said
he wants to dismantle apartheid.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of the jailed nationalist leader, said
Saturday that her 71-year-old husband would refuse release until
the government ends a state of emergency imposed in 1986, legalizes
the ANC and allows exiled ANC leaders to return to South Africa.
   A veteran ANC leader, Walter Sisulu, said today that problems
have cropped in up plans for Mandela's release, but he said it did
not know exactly what they were.
   Sisulu made his comments in Oslo, Norway, where he and five
other ANC leaders arrived to begin their first visit outside Africa
since being released from more than 25 years in South Africa
prisons.
   The Scandinavian countries have been strong supporters of the
ANC and were among the first countries to impose economic sanctions
against South Africa.
   Dullah Omar, a close friend of the Mandela family, told The
Associated Press today that Mandela has made it clear the
government must enact basic reforms to clear the way for talks
between whites and blacks.
   ``If and when he is released and there have been no major
changes, then he will report back to his organization (the ANC)
that three years of talks (with the government) have been a waste
of time,'' Omar said.
   In an allusion to resuming armed struggle, Omar said, Mandela
``will go back to where he left off, before he went to prison, and
will probably find himself back in prison in a month.''
   Mandela has been having talks with government leaders on ways to
resolve South Africa's political problems, which stem from the
country's apartheid system.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The country's 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.

   Only a few score Soviet Jews
have settled in the occupied West Bank since the new immigration
wave began, but their presence has drawn an outcry from the Arab
world and aroused U.S. concern.
   New arrivals say they fled anti-Semitism and did not come here
to make a political statement.
   ``I did not find any difference between the (occupied)
territories and Tel Aviv,'' said Kira Nefyodova, a short,
bespectacled Leningrad chemist. ``I'm very far from politics. I
don't want anybody to think that I'm making a political move.''
   Alex Yankevitch, a construction engineer, and his wife Liuba,
recalled finding a big yellow Star of David painted on their door
in Leningrad one morning, the work of an anti-Semite.
   ``And what can I do in Leningrad when the pogrom starts? I can
stand near my door and wait for the killers,'' he recalled, his
lips trembling. ``Here the Jewish army will defend me and my
family.''
   Even so, Palestinians view the presence of such Soviet emigres
in Ariel, a hilltop settlement 25 miles north of Jerusalem, as a
potential threat.
   In a protest to Western consulates, 25 prominent Palestinians
said up to 1 million Soviet Jews could come to Israel and that
their settlement in the occupied lands could undermine the peace
process and further strain limited housing and jobs, forcing
Palestinians to leave.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat asked the
Soviet Union not to allow Soviet Jews to emigrate if they are going
to settle in occupied territories.
   Jordan's King Hussein told The Jordan Times that settlement in
the territories was ``a serious and pending danger'' to stability
in the region.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today blamed the problem mainly
on U.S. immigration quotas. Criticism also has come from Egypt, the
only Arab state to have a peace treaty with Israel.
   Writing in the English-language Daily Mail, Cairo's former chief
U.N. delegate, Ahmed Tewfik Khalil, accused the Americans and
Soviets of colluding against Palestinians by failing to stop Jewish
immigrants from settling in the disputed lands.
   The Arab League took a different tact. Secretary-General Chedli
Klibi said today that the Soviet Jews' rights also are being
violated because he said they are being forced to go to Israel and
settle ``in a territory they have never seen before.''
   The protests followed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's statement
that suggested Israel needed the land it captured in the 1967
Middle East war to accommodate the new wave of immigrants.
   U.S. State Department officials objected to Shamir's remarks as
``not helpful.'' The United States views the settlements as an
obstacle to peace, and Washington has said it would not provide any
aid to house immigrants there.
   In Ariel, officials are not concealing their desire to increase
the Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza, which now is about
70,000 in more than 120 settlements.
   Ariel Mayor Ron Nachman said that even if Soviet Jews settle in
Tel Aviv the ``demographic reality will change'' and strengthen
Israel's claim to the land.
   His statement alluded to the position of the center-left Labor
Party, which opposes further settling of the occupied lands. It
argues the Jewish character of the state would be threatened by the
absorption of 1.7 million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza and that
this is the strongest argument for giving up the land. There are
3.7 million Jews and 810,000 Arabs in the pre-1967 boundaries.
   But few new arrivals have come to the occupied territories, and
the overall immigration to Israel has a long way to go before
realizing official predictions of 300,000 over the next three years.
   Absorption Ministry officials said about 1 percent, or less than
200, of the 16,000 Soviet Jews who arrived in the past 13 months
have moved to the occupied lands.
   ``The number of immigrants going there is not meaningful at all,
and it's only a matter of headlines,'' said Uri Gordon, head of
immigration at the Jewish Agency, which funds immigrant
resettlement programs.
   Many of those who do come to the West Bank do so on the advice
of friends or earlier immigrants and fail to grasp the complexity
of living in the West Bank. Only one of those interviewed said he
was motivated by political ideology.
   Ariel provides friendly volunteers to help with official
paperwork, is encouraging veteran residents to ``adopt'' new Soviet
arrivals and is sponsoring Hebrew classes.
   The warm welcome is important.
   ``We just felt welcome and needed here,'' said Yankevitch, 38.
``We were so nicely treated by everybody ... and this is so
important after we left so much behind.''
   Last week, Yankevitch rented a two-floor apartment from an
Israeli who left Ariel. As with any new immigrant, his rent and
most other expenses are covered in the first year by the government.
   Ariel officials say they receive virtually no other direct
government support for their absorption program, which brought 45
Soviet families to Ariel in the last four months.
   Ms. Nefyodova, 36, interviewed in her small kitchen surrounded
by a donated refrigerator, electric heater and gas stove, appeared
to be content.
   ``I never expected to find myself in the territories, and I did
not expect to find such quiet cities here,'' she said.

<HEAD>Savings Incentive, Capital Gains Tax Breaks in Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Congress today to cut
taxes on capital gains and create a new tax break to encourage
savings.
   Bush's 1991 budget calls for tax increases of $15.7 billion,
although there is no proposed general increase in personal income
taxes. The budget recommends $5.6 billion increases in user and
service fees and $1.8 billion worth of targeted tax cuts, including
a special credit of up to $1,000 a year for each child under the
age of 4 in lower-income families.
   Although the most sensitive revenue proposal in the budget is
the tax cut on capital gains, the one with the potential for
affecting the greatest number of taxpayers is the call for a reward
for increased savings.
   Under this proposal, a couple could avoid tax on the interest
earned on special ``family savings accounts'' held for seven years
or longer. While interest would be tax-exmept, deposits to such
accounts would have no tax advantage.
   Most couples would be allowed to invest up to $5,000 a year in
these accounts; a single person could invest $2,500. The tax break
would be limited to couples with incomes below $120,000 and single
people under $60,000.
   Bush also recommended that a first-time homebuyer be allowed to
withdraw up to $10,000 penalty-free from an Individual Retirement
Account in order to make a down payment on the home.
   The proposed capital-gains tax cut is more sweeping than the one
Bush failed to win from Congress last year. Democratic leaders have
fought any such reduction on grounds that 80 percent of the benefit
would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   ``A reduction in the capital-gains rate would help United States
businesses in the face of increasing global competition,'' Bush
said in a written message to Congress. He also repeated the
administration's insistence that cutting taxes on capital gains _
which are profits from the sale of stock, real estate and other
investments _ would increase revenues.
   Under Bush's plan, capital gains from property owned more than
one year would be taxed at lower rates than apply to wages and
other income. When fully phased in, the provision would exempt from
taxation 30 percent of profits from the sale of property owned at
least three years; 20 percent of gains from property owned more
than two but less than three years would be exempt; 10 percent of
gain from assets held more than one year would be exempt.
   Thus, a person whose regular income is taxed at 28 percent would
pay an effective rate of 19.6 percent on capital gains from
long-held property.
   Other revenue proposals include:
   _Making permanent the 3-percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service, which is due to expire Dec. 31.
   _Raising the 8-percent tax on airline tickets to 10 percent.
   _Increasing more than three times the fee on waterway shippers,
from 0.04 percent of value to 0.125 percent.
   _Requiring the 3.8 million state and local government workers
who are not covered by a retirement plan to pay Social Security
taxes. Also, state and local workers hired before April 1, 1986,
would be required to pay the 1.45 percent Medicare tax; most state
and local workers already pay.
   _Cutting oil industry taxes by creating four incentives for
drilling in old fields.
   _Imposing fees for a variety of government services, including
those provided by the Coast Guard and the Food and Drug
Administration.
   _Requiring veterans, except those with low incomes, to pay part
of their medical bills relating to non-service-connected ailments.
Many veterans wold have to pay a 1.75 percent fee on new VA housing
loan guarantees.

<HEAD>Opposition Seeks Details On Debts, Economic Decline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist leadership today promised
to provide the opposition with details on Bulgaria's economic
crisis but rejected a call for an independent commission to look
into the staggering foreign debt.
   The debt, estimated at more than $11 billion, is a major issue
of contention between the Communists and the Union of Democratic
Forces, a loose grouping of 12 independent movements and parties.
   In addition to a halt on new loans to Bulgaria, the opposition
has demanded the dismissal of the directors of the National Bank
and the Foreign Trade Bank, apparently for their role in the
mismanagement of Western credits during years of hard-line
Communist rule.
   Ventseslav Dimitrov, an economic adviser for the independent
trade union Podkrepa, said a halt on loans is necessary because
``we don't know what the previous credits have been used for.''
   The leader of the Communist delegation, Andrei Lukanov, reacted
sharply to the opposition's stance, saying: ``There is no example
in world history where the opposition negotiates with creditors of
a country to stop credits.''
   He said it was inappropriate for the opposition to object to new
credits deemed badly needed to help economic recovery.
   The Communists agreed to provide the opposition with information
it wants on the national economy when the talks convene again Feb.
6.
   The opposition-Communist talks emerged from the peaceful
pro-democracy revolution that ended more than three decades of rule
by Todor Zhivkov.
   A Communist Party congress opens Tuesday and is expected to
result in a showdown between conservatives and reformers, who favor
a clean break with the past to shed the image associated with
Zhivkov's hard-line leadership.

<HEAD>More Drug War, Head Start Money; Another Attempt At
Tenant-Ownership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget President Bush sent Congress today
includes a new attempt to encourage family savings and a
significant boost for Head Start while making a fresh effort to
dramatically shift the focus of federal housing programs.
   The $1.23 trillion fiscal 1991 budget proposal also includes a
major cash infusion for the war on drugs and new initiatives _ in
the form of higher spending _ for space and biotechnology programs.
   Other programs slated for significant spending increases are the
Federal Aviation Administration, a proposal that relies heavily on
dipping into an aviation trust fund, and efforts to clean up
hazardous materials at nuclear plants and other facilities run by
the federal government.
   Some of the ``initiatives'' offered in the spending blueprint
are indeed new; others, like the president's child-care and
capital-gains proposals, are simply new attempts to win
congressional approval of Bush proposals that did not survive
Congress last year.
   And for all its new and reworked initiatives, the budget
proposal also includes an attempt to head off one of the biggest
initiatives likely to emerge on Capitol Hill: an attempt to take
advantage of the so-called ``peace dividend'' created by declining
world tensions by spending money now earmarked for the military on
domestic programs.
   ``The sum of all such planned expenditures totals about 10 times
the over-estimated dividend, which is itself perhaps five times the
actual dividend,'' Budget Director Richard Darman said in a message
accompanying the budget. ``Thus, Washington entertains the notion
of spending 50 times a dividend that has not definitively
materialized _ a true Wonderland phenomenon.''
   The battle over the real or imagined ``peace dividend'' is
likely to be the biggest budget skirmish. Several of the
president's other initiatives also appear certain to alienate
Congress' majority Democrats, while others likely will be accepted
quickly, perhaps with tinkering.
   Here are brief summaries of several Bush policy initiatives. The
numbers are for proposed fiscal 1991 spending unless labeled as
``spending authority,'' meaning that the amount shown is what the
administration is asking to spend spent over several years.
   _FAMILY SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. In a bid to improve the nation's
anemic savings rate, Bush proposes exempting from income tax the
interest paid on family savings accounts that are held for seven
years. The limit would be $5,000 for those filing a joint tax
return; $2,500 for individual returns. Withdrawals taken after the
seven years would be tax free and a 10 percent excise penalty would
be assessed on early withdrawals.
   _HEAD START. Bush proposes adding $500 million in spending
authority to the pre-school education program in fiscal 1991, for a
total of $1.9 billion. The 36 percent increase should allow the
program, a favorite of Democrats and Republicans alike, to enroll
180,000 more 4-year-olds from low-income families, according to the
administration. About 450,000 children now participate in Head
Start programs.
   _HOUSING. The president's $23 billion Department of Housing and
Urban Development budget includes expansion of two of the pet
projects of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp _ urban enterprise zones and
tenant ownership. Bush's proposal to shift nearly $60 million from
low-income rental programs to a certificate program that allows
tenants of housing projects and other federally subsidized housing
programs to buy their units likely will face stiff opposition in
Congress from liberal Democrats who do not believe tenant ownership
will work on a large scale in many areas of the country.
   _THE DRUG WAR. Bush unveiled this part of his budget last week,
proposing to boost federal spending authority for the drug war by
$1.1 billion to $10.6 billion.
   _SPACE. Bush proposes increasing the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's spending from $12 billion to $14.1 billion.
The budget projects a record 10 space shuttle flights next fiscal
year at a cost of more than $8 billion and also proposes budget
authority of $2.6 billion for development of the manned space
station and $1.2 billion for exploration activities to support the
planned Moon-Mars mission.
   _AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. Bush proposed an increase in overall FAA
spending that would see a reduction in the amount of direct federal
spending for air safety while the amount taken from an aviation
trust fund financed by user fees would increase sharply.
   Bush proposed outlays of $1.2 billion in federal funds for the
FAA next year, down from about $3 billion in the current fiscal
year, while spending $6 billion from the trust fund, up from $3.4
billion this year. Bush said his proposed increase for the FAA
would allow for the hiring of 495 more air traffic controllers and
300 safety specialists. The administration said those increases
were needed because of increasing number of commercial flights and
the aging of the nation's aircraft fleet. Bush proposed increased
user fees to help pay for the increase.
   _HAZARDOUS CLEANUP. Bush proposes spending $4.2 billion to clean
up hazardous materials at Department of Energy nuclear plants and
other facilities run by NASA and the departments of Defense,
Interior, Agriculture and Transportation. That would be an increase
$642 million over the current fiscal year.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people shouting support
for the provisional government converged on Bucharest today and
urged leaders to stand firm against opposition demands that they
resign.
   It was the biggest pro-government rally in weeks and came one
day after thousands massed in the largest anti-government protest
since the December revolution.
   Demonstrators marched down major city streets shouting support
for President Ion Iliescu and his National Salvation Front, which
has been accused of supporting the same totalitarian tactics as the
ousted Communist regime.
   Another crowd of several thousand gathered outside massed
outside the offices of opposition National Peasant Party, which
organized Sunday's anti-government protest. ``We won't leave until
you dissolve the party!'' the crowd chanted.
   ``Iliescu, don't give up! The country is your army!''
demonstrators shouted as they marched past cheering shopkeepers and
pedestrians.
   Iliescu told the crowd the Front would not resign.
   ``The Front stands soundly on its own feet. The Front is not in
danger ... We remain open to dialogue with the whole country (and)
we stretch out our hands to all those who want to talk, to work and
to rebuild the country,'' he said.
   By late morning, more than 10,000 pro-Front forces had gathered
in Victory Square, and thousands more were marching and even
running toward the plaza where the Front's governing council has
its headquarters.
   It appeared the protest would attract more people than Sunday's
anti-government rally, which drew about 15,000 people. It was the
biggest such rally since the revolution that ousted dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The national news agency Rompres said ``tens of thousands'' of
people, many of them just off night shifts in Bucharest factories,
massed outside government headquarters and that many people had
come to the capital from other areas of the country.
   Many groups of protesters arrived in trucks, and how the crowd
came together indicated workers may have been instructed to attend
_ a tactic often used by Communist leaders. A smaller pro-Front
rally also was held Sunday, and one participant said he had been
directed by superiors at work to attend.
   A woman at today's pro-government rally alleged that people were
bribed to attend the opposition protest Sunday. ``They were given
dollars, cigarettes, and lei,'' she said, referring to Romania's
currency. She refused to give her name.
   The National Salvation Front, a loose grouping of intellectuals
and former Communists and dissidents, has been governing by decree
since Ceausescu fled the capital Dec. 22. He was executed Dec. 25.
   The trial of four men who were close Ceausescu associates
resumed today before a military tribunal in Bucharest. The four
went on trial Saturday on charges of complicity in the murder of
anti-government protesters who were killed by security forces
during the revolution.
   The defendants are former Communist Party secretary Emil Bobu,
considered the No. 3 figure in the Ceausescu leadership; former
Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu; and former Politburo members
Manea Manescu and Ion Dinca.
   Only Dinca has testified. When he took the stand Saturday, he
said he had done nothing to stop the shooting of protesters in
December.
   Demands for the Front's resignation erupted Tuesday when the
leadership announced plans to compete in national elections in May.
Critics say the Front cannot fairly compete in an election that it
also administers. Some accuse it of being a front for Communist
rule, noting that it includes some former ranking Communists.
   The protesters Sunday broke through a line of soldiers and
rallied outside Front headquarters. Many demanded the opposition be
given positions in the provisional government.
   They booed Iliescu when he appeared on an upper floor of the
building and chanted ``Resign! Resign!'' and ``Get out, or we'll
come get you out!'' as he tried to speak.
   Iliescu pledged later to renew dialogue with the more than 20
political parties hoping to compete in the May election, a promise
he repeated today.
   Like the protest Sunday, today's demonstration violated a ban
imposed by the Front on rallies without advance police permission.
   Authorities made no attempt to disperse the pro-Front
demonstrators, but there was a cordon of soldiers, tanks and
armored cars outside the Foreign Ministry building that houses the
government headquarters.
   Some demonstrators commandeered heavy construction equipment and
trucks to join in the processions.
   ``The Front is representing us,'' shopkeeper Viorica Mustareata
told The Associated Press as she yelled support from the sidelines.
``The Front is with the peasants, the workers, with everyone.''
   The anti-government protest was called by the largest opposition
party, the National Peasant Party, as well as the National Liberal
Party and the Social Democratic Party which joined the Peasant
Party in calling for a broad coalition government until the
elections in May.
   After nightfall, truckloads of pro-government demonstrators were
brought to the square, some shouting that the opposition protesters
were ``provocateurs'' and ``gypsies.''

<HEAD>Flood, Landslide Death Toll Reaches 160</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rains years caused floods and
landslides that have killed at least 160 people in the past week,
officials said today.
   Eighty were dead and at least two dozen were missing in the
Central Java provincial capital of Semarang, about 310 miles east
of Jakarta, said a provincial police officer on condition of
anonymity.
   The officer said there also were casualties in floods in Kendal
and Demak and landslides in Batang and Temgangung regencies. He
declined to elaborate.
   But the newspaper Suara Pembaruan said the death toll has risen
to 28 from a landslide Thursday night in Temanggung, about 30 miles
south of Semarang.
   At least one other person still was missing in the landslide,
which destroyed dozens of houses as villagers slept, it said.
   In Batang, at least 34 people were found dead after floods swept
over two villages Saturday and Sunday and caused a landslide that
destroyed more than 40 houses, the newspaper added.
   In Indonesia's easternmost province, Irian Jaya, rescuers have
found 16 bodies buried in a landslide that struck Saturday in the
district of Gurabesi on the outskirts of the provincial capital of
Jayapura, a spokesman for the governor's office said. He said
rescuers still were looking for one women believed buried in the
landslide.
   Jayapura is about 1,900 miles northeast of Jakarta.
   In West Java, heavy rains last week caused a landslide Wednesday
that killed two people in a village in Cianjur regency.
   On Sunday, heavy rain also caused some rivers to overflow and
inundated most of the eastern part of Jakarta. More than 21,000
people were affected, but no casualties were reported.

   Regional air controllers knew a Colombian
jetliner was low on fuel and needed priority landing clearance 50
minutes before it crashed, but local controllers never got the
information, investigators said.
   The investigation into Avianca Flight 52's crash, which killed
73 people and injured 85, is focusing on the communication gap
between the high-altitude air traffic controllers and those
handling landings at three local airports, said Lee Dickinson, of
the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Dickinson said investigators planned to interview the regional
controllers today. Investigators also returned this morning to the
crash site in Cove Neck on Long Island. They were expected to end
the on-site investigation later today or Tuesday.
   Records indicated the Boeing 707 had more than enough fuel for
the flight from Bogota and Medellin, Colombia, to New York, but the
jet flew in three holding patterns totaling nearly 90 minutes along
the East Coast because of weather-related congestion before it
crashed Thursday night, investigators said.
   As the plane neared the end of its final, 46-minute holding
pattern south of Kennedy International Airport, the crew told
controllers in the regional New York Center about the fuel shortage
and requested priority clearance to land, Dickinson said.
   At that point, controllers asked pilot Laureano Caviedes what
his alternate landing site was, and, according to Federal Aviation
Administration tapes, he replied, ``Boston. I can't make it.''
   Shortly afterward, the regional controllers turned the aircraft
over to the local controllers. But, after interviewing six local
controllers who either handled or tracked the flight, investigators
determined they were unaware of the shortage.
   ``For whatever reasons, we don't know, the controllers (handling
landings at Kennedy) did not know that,'' Dickinson told reporters
late Sunday.
   ``I don't know why it wasn't passed on. It may have been passed
on in a different style, if you will,'' he said without elaborating.
   He said the regional and local controllers had spoken to each
other by telephone when transferring control of the plane.
   At 9:24 p.m. the plane aborted an attempted landing at Kennedy,
apparently because of bad weather, and the pilot immediately said
he wanted to try again, saying twice to one of the controllers that
he was low on fuel, Dickinson said.
   That was the first time the local controller knew anything about
a fuel problem, Dickinson said.
   Less than 10 minutes later the plane crashed. The pilot and the
other two members of the cockpit crew were among those killed.
   A federal official close to the investigation who spoke on
condition of anonymity said information obtained by investigators
indicates the error appeared to lie with the regional controllers.
   Dickinson emphasized that when the pilot told the regional
controllers he needed a priority landing, the word ``emergency''
was never used and for that reason the severity of the situation
may not have been relayed.
   Asked what procedures would have mandated an emergency, he
replied without elaboration: ``There are certain phrases that the
cockpit should tell the controller. The word `emergency' was never
used. The word `priority' was.''
   Dickinson noted that an American Airlines flight that landed
right before Avianca's aborted attempt had 14 minutes of fuel when
it landed. The American pilot had told controllers he would declare
a fuel emergency if he was not immediately cleared for landing.
   Many pilots are reluctant to declare a fuel emergency because
the FAA strictly monitors those cases, according to aviation
officials. Should the agency determine a pilot was not justified in
declaring an emergency, the pilot's license can be suspended.
   ``Pilots are not anxious to declare an emergency,'' he said,
``because they then have to explain it to the FAA. The FAA comes in
and says, `OK, what's the emergency here?'''
   ``It's embarrassing,'' The New York Times quoted an unidentified
pilot as saying. ``Plus you have to write a lot of reports.''
   Investigators determined during the weekend that none of the
Avianca's four engines was running when it slammed into a wooded
hillside.
   Investigators earlier said the plane may have had up to 10,000
pounds, or nearly 1,500 gallons, of fuel upon impact. But NTSB
spokesman Mike Benson said Sunday that figure could be wrong
because the fuel gauges may have given inaccurate readings.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble in Seattle has said that 1,500
gallons of fuel could have been enough to get the plane from the
crash site to the airport 15 miles away, ``but not much more.''
   Benson said the NTSB planned to calibrate and test the gauges.
   The Boeing 707 fuel gauges cannot be trusted when the level goes
below 10,000 pounds, said John Nance, a former Braniff pilot who is
an airline safety analyst.
   Officials changed survivor totals twice during the weekend.
After officials compared Avianca's passenger list and hospital
records, they revised the tally of people on board from 161 to 159;
officials could not immediately explain the second change, to 158.
   More than 20 survivors remained in critical condition, hospitals
reported.

<HEAD>Moderate Earthquake Shakes Central New Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS LUNAS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake jolted central New
Mexico strongly enough to rattle furniture this morning, but no
injuries were reported.
   ``We felt the whole house shake,'' said Albert Miranda of
Veguita, a few miles from the quake's epicenter south of
Albuquerque. ``It didn't last very long. The chandelier shook, but
nothing was broken. It was a fast shake.''
   ``The dog went wild barking in the house,'' said Albino Salas
Jr. of Bernardo. ``He was running all over the room.''
   Pat Jorgenson of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park,
Calif., said the survey's National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo., measured the tremor at 4.5 on the Richter scale.
   The epicenter of the 6:16 a.m. quake was 40 miles south of
Albuquerque, almost exactly the same spot as one of the same
magnitude on Nov. 28, 1989, she said.
   Both quakes occurred along the Rio Grande Rift, which splits New
Mexico north to south, paralleling the Rio Grande from Colorado to
El Paso, Texas, Ms. Jorgenson said.
   The last time before November that an earthquake struck the same
area was July 1906, she said.
   Allan Sanford, a professor of geophysics at the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, said earthquakes are
relatively rare in the state. California, he said, has 100 times as
much quake activity as New Mexico.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause
moderate damage in the local area, and 5 can cause considerable
damage.
   The earthquake that caused heavy damage in the San
Francisco-Oakland area on Oct. 17 measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.

<HEAD>With PM-Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How do you explain a $1.23 trillion federal
budget with a deficit in the billions of dollars tucked away in
nearly 190,000 accounts and recorded in a book that runs to 1,569
intimidating pages?
   Budget director Richard G. Darman used child's terms today to
tell readers what it all means. In an introduction to President
Bush's fiscal 1991 budget plan, Darman spoke solemnly of PACMEN,
the Cookie Monster and Wonderland.
   To Darman, the federal budget might be seen as ``the Ultimate
Cookie Monster,'' a reference to the gruff character on the
``Sesame Street'' children's TV show who ``cannot resist gobbling
up anything and everything that might be consumed _ especially
cookies.''
   The budget's ``excessive tendencies toward consumption are not
exactly ennobling,'' Darman wrote. ``But at the same time, its
underlying motivation is clearly not malevolent.
   ``What harm it may cause is largely unintended. Its massive
presence might be understood as little more than a compilation of
cookies received, cookies crumbled and crumbs spewed forth.''
   Darman says the Cookie Monster analogy isn't fair to the Cookie
Monster or the budget. ``In reality, a budget is not just a
monstrous mass of cookies and crumbs,'' he says. ``It is more: an
implicit statement of values and expectations for the future.''
   Using the imagery of the PACMAN video game, Darman warns of
rising costs of such federal liabilities as health care, pensions,
mandatory benefit programs, insurance coverage and environmental
cleanup obligations.
   ``Each is like a hidden PACMAN, waiting to spring forward and
consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze,'' the
budget chief wrote.
   Then it's off to ``Wonderland,'' Darman's name for a political
fairyland where he believes Congress is heading when it starts
tinkering with the budget.
   Darman says a new game on Capitol Hill is finding ways to spend
the ``peace dividend,'' the supposed savings in defense spending
resulting from the recent easing of East-West tensions.
   ``It starts by overestimating the dividend,'' he wrote. ``Then
each player plans to spend the dividend in his or her preferred
way. The sum of all such planned expenditures totals about 10 times
the overestimated dividend, which is itself perhaps five times the
actual dividend.
   ``Thus, Washington entertains the notion of spending 50 times a
dividend that has not yet definitively materialized _ a true
Wonderland phenomenon,'' Darman says.
   He also characterizes as a ``very dangerous game politically''
the recent congressional demands for a cut in Social Security taxes.
   ``Indeed, Wonderland seems to be running wild with attractive
fantasies, but without yet having established coherent direction,''
he wrote.
   In a footnote, Darman observed that the budget document was
published this year in a single volume, rather than the seven
separate budget books issued in previous years.
   The aim, he said, was to make the federal budget easier _ and
perhaps more informative _ to read.
   ``There is no formal record of the number of individuals who may
have read, cover-to-cover, the previous seven-volume editions of
the budget,'' Darman wrote. ``Nor are there epidemiological studies
of their fate.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Predicts an End to the Angolan War in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER WISE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi
today said pressure from the superpowers and Angola's weariness
with bloodshed would bring an end to the 15-year-old civil war this
year.
   Savimbi made the comments on his first visit to Lisbon since
Portugal granted independence to the African nation in 1975, when
fighting began between his U.S.-backed guerrillas and the Marxist
government supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba.
   Portugal recognizes the existing government and Savimbi had been
banned until this year from coming to the country.
   ``The pressure for peace from inside and outside Angola will be
so great, I don't see how either side will be able to continue
fighting in 1990,'' he said. ``We are going to launch an enormous
effort to end the war this year.''
   Savimbi's remarks came against a background of increased
diplomatic efforts to break a deadlock in the Angolan peace process
as U.S. envoy Herman Cohen traveled from Angola to London, where he
was reportedly to hold talks with Soviet officials on the war in
Angola.
   A cease-fire agreement was signed in June in Gbadolite, Zaire,
but it collapsed within days.
   Since December, the guerrillas have been holding off what they
describe as the biggest government offensive ever mounted against
their strongholds.
   Savimbi also said the guerrilla group was involved in direct
contacts with Cuba to provide guarantees that his forces would not
attack Cuban soldiers. Cuba suspended the withdrawal of its troops
from Angola after four Cubans where killed in a guerrilla raid Jan.
21.
   Savimbi described the attack as ``involuntary'' and said the
guerrilla group would provide Cuba with assurances such incidents
would not be repeated.
   Cuba began withdrawing its troops after South Africa pledged in
December 1988 to halt aid to the guerrillas and grant independence
to neighboring Nambia.
   Savimbi said the next step in the peace process should be a halt
in the government offensive followed by moves to bring about direct
talks between himself and Eduardo dos Santos.
   ``The Americans and the Portuguese can play a more active role
in the search for peace by establishing where the common ground
between the two sides lies and using that to bring us together,''
Savimbi said.
   He said Washington and Lisbon should act in support of peace
efforts by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire.
   Savimbi said the guerrillas backed Mobuto as a mediator and
Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African Affairs,
had told him by telephone today that Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos shared the same position.
   The guerrilla leader was on the third day of a visit that marked
the end of a 15-year ban on his travel to Portugal.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communists agreed to share
power with the opposition and move up elections by nearly two
months because of growing civil unrest that threatens the country's
existence, Premier Hans Modrow said today.
   The government said it would hold elections on March 18 instead
of May 6, and form a governing coalition with the opposition until
a freely elected leadership takes office.
   Also today, authorities arrested former hard-line leader Erich
Honecker, and a prosecutor said he would be tried for high treason
in March.
   Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told Parliament that
Honecker and former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag
and Joachim Herrmann would be tried by the Supreme Court. All four
have been expelled from the party.
   If convicted, Honecker, who was ousted Nov. 10 in East Germany's
peaceful revolt against his 18-year Stalinist regime, could face
life in prison.
   Honecker, 77, was taken to prison after being released from a
hospital where he had undergone surgery for kidney cancer, the
official ADN news agency said. His lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked
prosecutors to free Honecker from custody because he is too ill to
stay in jail, ADN said.
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today said he plans
to make campaign appearances for conservatives running in the East
German elections. Kohl, a Christian Democrat, said he will be
talking this week with pro-democracy opposition forces and East
Germany's Christian Democratic leaders to decide which party to
back.
   Opposition activists initially had resisted overtures by the
still-dominant Communists to join an interim government but
apparently felt the situation had become so dire that they had no
other choice.
   East Germany's economy is on the brink of disaster and many of
its most promising young workers have joined a destabilizing exodus
to the West. As many as 2,500 East Germans have been fleeing daily.
   Modrow urged parliament today to support the agreement with the
opposition.
   The premier said strikes and the exodus of workers have worsened
the economy and set off a chain reaction of economic breakdowns,
``threatening the existence of East Germany.''
   Modrow said bomb threats and vandalism have spread. ``Protection
of citizens can no longer be fully guaranteed,'' Modrow told the
500-member People's Chamber.
   ``The current government coalition is proving increasingly
fragile,'' Modrow said. ``Economic and social tensions have
increased. The economic situation is deteriorating in a worrying
way.''
   Opposition forces had wanted to stay out of the government until
the elections to avoid sharing blame for the country's economic
catastrophe.
   But Modrow's transition government, a collection of relatively
reformist Communists who are trying to salvage their standing among
the citizenry, was beginning to unravel. Reforms to encourage
Western investment have been held up by disputes between Communists
and various opposition groups.
   As a result, a decline in production and living standards has
hastened.
   Seeking to draw opposition leaders into a grand coalition to
govern until the elections, Modrow opened talks Sunday with
representatives of nine reform movements and a handful of minor
parties long aligned with the Communists.
   The Communists suffered the defections of some leading reformers
a week ago and the crisis deepened Thursday when three ministers
from the Christian Democratic Union _ a party traditionally allied
with the Communists _ pulled out of the 27-member Cabinet.
   Modrow and more than 40 representatives of rival political
forces agreed that a new Cabinet will be submitted by Wednesday to
Parliament.
   The decisions were announced by Martin Ziegler, a Lutheran
Church official, who said the new leadership would include one
member from each of the nine opposition groups represented at
weekly talks with government.
   He said the ministers would be named without portfolio, and it
was not immediately clear if the Cabinet would be expanded or if
some current ministers would give up seats. The government
currently has 16 Communist ministers.
   Wolfgang Schnur of the opposition Democratic Awakening said the
Cabinet members will decide later how to distribute ministerial
responsibilities.
   All the political groups are vying for voter support in this
country of 16 million.
   Many opposition parties held weekend congresses to chart
election strategy, but the meetings served more to highlight
differences dividing the groups and preventing the emergence of a
united force to challenge the Communists.
   New Forum, the largest of the pro-democracy groups, previously
claimed 200,000 members. But a moderate faction split off from the
movement to form the German Forum Party over the weekend.
   Meanwhile, Christian Democratic Union leader Lothar de Maiziere
announced he was prepared to seek an election coalition with
Democratic Awakening and the German Social Union, two East German
opposition groups that support market-oriented reforms and closer
ties with West Germany.

<HEAD>Assembly Proposes Independence on March 21</HEAD>
<HEAD>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Nambian legislature today
proposed that the territory declare independence March 21 and bring
to an end 75 years of South African rule.
   The Constituent Assembly submitted the date to Namibia's South
African administrator, Louis Pienaar, who is expected to approve.
The assembly plans to vote on the proposal at a session Tuesday.
   South Africa has agreed to grant independence to Namibia,
Africa's last colony, under a regional peace treaty. More than
6,000 United Nations military and civilian personnel have been
supervising the process since last April.
   The 72-member Constituent Assembly, elected in November, also is
debating a democratic, Western-style constitution and is to begin
voting on the document Tuesday article-by-article.
   All leading parties represented in the assembly have expressed
support for the proposed constitution and no major disagreements
are expected.
   The document has a declaration of fundamental rights, including
freedom of movement, speech, and a free press. It also envisions a
multiparty democracy, regular elections, an independent judiciary
and an executive president limited to two five-year terms.
   One potentially contentious provision would allow for detention
without trial at times of war and during a state of emergency. At
such times, the government could detain a person without charge if
he was considered ``a clear and present danger to the security of
the state.''
   The leftist South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged
a 23-year bush war against South African rule, captured 41 seats in
the assembly and will form the first government. The group's
leader, Sam Nujoma, is expected to become the country's first
president.
   However, at least 48 assembly members, or two-thirds, must
approve each article of the constitution.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a free enterprise economy, has 21 seats. The 10 remaining
assembly seats are divided among five parties.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle today
praised Panama's U.S-installed government for its plans to change
its banking system to curtail the laundering of drug money.
   ``I'm impressed with (Panamanian President Guillermo) Endara's
willingness to move in a different direction in dealing with
important issues like the laundering of drug money,'' Quayle told a
news conference as he ended an overnight visit here before heading
for Jamaica.
   ``Changes will make it easier to detect this type of activity,''
he said.
   Endara, appearing with Quayle, did not detail what changes are
being contemplated in the banking system but said he knows some
must be made.
   ``Panama's bankers want reasonable changes which don't unduly
change the banking environment,'' Endara said through an
interpreter. ``They know Panama cannot continue to be the center
for ... drug dollars. We have to participate in the fight against
drug trafficking.''
   Alluding to the former Panamanian government of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, which was toppled in December after a U.S.
military invasion, Quayle said:
   ``We now have a government here that will join the United States
in the war on drugs, where before we had a government that was
cooperating in the transportation and production of illegal drugs.
   ``A tremendous change has occurred in Panama with the war
against drugs and our campaign to get to the bottom of this taking
a significant step forward with the commitment of President
Endara,'' he added.
   Panama's system of confidential bank accounts similar to that in
Switzerland has attracted more than 100 international banks,
employing nearly 8,000 people. Coded banking accounts can be opened
in Panama under government orders if the account holder is under
investigation.
   ``We do not know what they will be yet,'' Endara said of the
changes. ``Bankers are not opposed to reasonable changes that do
not affect the banking environment. But they also know that Panama
cannot continue to be a center for narcodollars.''
   ``But we are opposed to fishing expeditions which is what the
U.S. officials want,'' Edgardo Lasso, president of Panama's banking
association, said recently.
   Following the news conference with Endara, Quayle flew to
Jamaica for the last leg of his three-day damage-control mission in
the wake of the Dec. 20 Panama invasion that offended leaders of
many Latin American countries.
   In Kingston, Quayle expected to hear complaints about a cutback
of $25 million in economic aid to the Caribbean country.
   Prime Minister Michael Manley has said President Bush is sending
new aid to help with economic reform in Poland and Hungary at the
expense of small countries like Jamaica.
   Bush's newly announced plan to provide Panama with $1 billion to
help recover from the invasion adds to the sting. Manley said the
cutback means his country will not have adequate resources for its
war on drugs, which he estimated at $29 million for its initial
phase.
   The new leaders in Panama, and the congregation of a
pro-American church Quayle attended Sunday, were in favor of the
U.S. military action.
   ``At this moment the police forces are not quite capable of
protecting the lives, property and public order as the Panamanian
people want,'' said Endara after attending mass with Quayle.
``That's why we need the U.S. forces in Panama at this moment, but
we hope that in a very short time this will not be necessary.''
   Quayle, a day after being pressed by other Latin heads of state
to get the occupying troops out of Panama, insisted they will be
withdrawn within a matter of weeks. He and the leaders of Costa
Rica, Venezuela, Guatemala, El Salvador and Belize attended the
presidential inauguration in Honduras on Saturday.
   ``Certainly there is concern about the security and the future
of Panama,'' Quayle said, adding he had discussed with Endara how
to help build Panama's police into a viable force.
   Bush, he said, ``wants to see the troops withdrawn and to obtain
a level that we had prior to Operation Just Cause as soon as
possible,'' Quayle said.
   One administration official predicted the troop level could be
down from the current 17,000 to the pre-invasion 13,000 within two
weeks.
   The vice president spent part of Sunday in meetings with
government leaders. But he also visited a popular tourist viewing
site on the Panama Canal, bought bananas at an outdoor market,
stopped at a T-shirt stand to buy shirts for his three children and
watched part of the Super Bowl with U.S. soldiers at Fort Clayton.
   He also said in a television interview on ABC's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' that he understands the reasoning of Mexico and
Venezuela in not wanting him to visit their countries at this time.
   They told him a visit would be inopportune due to anti-invasion
sentiment, ``but I will be visiting those countries later on,''
Quayle said.
   Offering a new rationale for the invasion, Quayle said that if
Manuel Antonio Noriega had stayed in power, U.S. adherence to the
Panama Canal treaty would have been jeopardized.
   ``Implementing the treaty as ratified by the Senate would have
been a very difficult proposition,'' he said on the Brinkley show.
   The agreement, signed under President Carter, calls for the
United States to cede control of the canal to Panama at the end of
this century.
   Quayle was warmly received by Panamanians at Cristo Rey Roman
Catholic Church. The Rev. Javier Villanueva, who was renowned for
his anti-Noriega sermons in pre-invasion days, said the U.S.
military intervention had helped end Panamanian suffering.

   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was
arrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he will
tried for high treason in March.
   Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's
Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant
kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.
   Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told Parliament that
Honecker and former Politburo members Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag
and Joachim Herrmann would be tried by the Supreme Court on treason
charges in March. All four have been expelled from the party.
   Mielke was Honecker's security chief, Mittag oversaw the economy
and Herrmann headed the party's propaganda department. Eleven
members of Honecker's ousted Politburo already are in prison
awaiting trial.
   Honecker's lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked the chief prosecutor to
free the former leader from Rummelburg prison based on a doctor's
statement that he is too ill to stay in jail, ADN said. Vogel is
East Germany's most prominent lawyer.
   One of Honecker's doctors, Horst Vogler, said the former leader
was ``very depressed'' and his mental state ``impaired'' following
two major surgical operations since August.
   West German television showed an impassive Honecker being led
out of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness. She
kissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine.
   Honecker's daughter, son-in-law and youngest grandchild also
came to see him off at the hospital, ADN quoted Vogler as saying.
   The charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment.
The conviction used to carry the death penalty, but that was
abolished in reforms that followed Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.
   East Germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out
corruption and abuse of office.
   Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East
Germany for 18 years, had previously been declared too ill to
withstand imprisonment.
   ADN said the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter
Althaus, repeated today that in his opinion Honecker is still not
well enough to be jailed.
   On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
Honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison
hospital because of his condition. ADN did not say whether
Rummelsburg prison is equipped with a medical facility.
   Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to
put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the
hospital.

<TEXT>
   Two U.N. planes flew to the rebel-held
city of Juba today to evacuate foreign relief workers who had been
trapped by a civil war.
   Some of the foreigners apparently couldn't wait for the U.N.
jets and left on a plane belonging to a relief organization, U.N.
spokeswoman Pat Banks said. Those who waited included the United
Nations' sole representative in Juba, an American named Bob
Brandstetter, she said.
   It was unclear how many foreigners were taken out of the
southern city, which has been shelled twice in the last 10 days and
become the focus of an increasingly turbulent war.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army promised in a radio
broadcast to hold fire today from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. to allow the
evacuation of foreigners. The only foreigners believed to be in
Juba are relief workers and missionaries, and estimates of their
numbers range from 80 to 120.
   A British Embassy official said he understood that about 30
people, more than a dozen of them Britons, opted to be airlifted
out. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy put the number at about 20
and said they included four Americans.
   The United Nations sent two Canadian-built Twin Otter aircraft
to Juba from the Sudan capital of Khartoum, 750 miles away, and
from Lokichokio, in Kenya.
   But Ms. Banks said that by the time the planes arrived in Juba,
all but four of the people planning to leave had already left
aboard a special plane of the Lutheran World Federation, which has
been operating a small relief airflift to Juba.
   That group flew to Nairobi, Kenya. The four who waited for the
U.N. plane were to fly to Khartoum, Ms. Banks said.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army, mainly black African
Christians and animists, began fighting in 1983 to wrest
concessions for the south from the Arab Moslem-dominated central
government. Juba has about 250,000 people and is the largest city
in southern Sudan.
   The rebels have cut off almost all approaches by road to Juba,
and at least three civilian aircraft have been shot down in the
area. The only food trickling in has been via the Lutheran World
Federation airlift.
   The city is believed to have only a month's worth of food
supplies left.

<TEXT>
   Legislation strictly controlling
gun ownership will be submitted to parliament and two commissions
will be set up to supervise the police, the interior minister said
Monday.
   The security forces have been reorganized since the formation of
a non-Communist-led government and the commissions will determine
if new directives issued from Prague are being followed nationwide,
said Interior Minister Richard Sacher.
   ``There are still people in the security forces who understand
the recent events only as a transitory period,'' he said.
   There are 130,000 valid gun permits in the country allowing the
legal ownership of 143,000 firearms, 135,000 shotguns that can be
used by hunters, and another 135,000 firearms held by registered
collectors, he said.
   ``When you sum this up, you have quite a nice army,'' the
minister said.
   Sacher said last week he was suspending all valid permits
starting Friday to force registration of firearms in private hands.
   He said not only high ranking Communist Party leaders have been
entitled to hold firearms but many lower ranking officials too. The
draft law on firearms and ammunition to be sent to parliament would
much more strictly limit permits.
   The minister, the first non-Communist in Eastern Europe to be
put in charge of a nation's police, indicated there could be an
unknown number of weapons in circulation illegally, describing a
``leak of firearms due to losses by their legal holders.''
   Asked about rumors concerning a possible coup attempt, Sacher
said: ``I'm convinced there is no such possibility, because there
is no support among the people for such forces. It could be perhaps
only a local affair.''
   ``These reports can, however, be qualified as a criminal act of
`spreading alarming reports,''' Sacher added.
   He said security forces in Bohemia would be reinforced by the
troops of the Interior Ministry, while the Slovak security forces
would be reinforced by regular army troops.

   East Germany will allow artists to turn part
of the Berlin Wall's bare eastern face into an outdoor gallery, a
West Berlin art promoter said Monday.
   David Monty said plans call for a nearly one-mile stretch in
East Berlin to be set aside for painting and sculpture by 120
artists.
   An East German border guard official, at a news conference with
Monty, said authorities expect to leave that wall segment standing
and indicated the Defense Ministry has no objections to the project.
   Monty said he hoped to enlist famous names to work on 20 percent
of the 33-foot-tall concrete panels making up the wall.
   The artworks, to be encased in clear plastic, would be opened to
the public in May, he said. All topics would be permitted except
campaign slogans for East Germany's elections and ``racism,'' Monty
added.
   Contrary to the blank East German side, the West Berlin face of
the wall in most places is covered with colorful graffiti.
   East Germany's Communist authorities opened the wall Nov. 9.
Interim President Manfred Gerlach later said it would be torn down
and replaced with a less imposing installation. Officials say the
wall panels will be sold abroad for hard currency, with the revenue
to be used for social causes.
   Last week, border guards and soldiers removed a first 320-yard
stretch and carted the piece to a depot for storage.

   A Maryland real estate agent, dubbed ``Robin
HUD'' after admitting she stolemillions of dollars in federal
housing funds and gave some of it to the poor, pleaded guilty today
and said she felt ``terrific.''
   Marilyn Louise Harrell smiled throughout the hearing in U.S.
District Court in pleading guilty to charges that she stole at
least $4.75 million and lied on her tax returns and to federal
officials. Her trial was to have begun today.
   The 46-year-old Ms. Harrell said she had decided to plead guilty
as part of a plea agreement because she did not want to spend
taxpayers' money in a court proceeding.
   She pleaded guilty to stealing government property and failing
to report income for taxes. As part of the plea bargain,
prosecutors dropped two other tax counts, two counts of lying to
officials from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, and one count of lying to a bank on a loan application.
   But prosecutors said the still do not believe her story that she
gave most of the money to charity because she is a born-again
Christian.
   ``My assertion that she has been her own biggest charity will be
fact'' by April 20, the date she is to be sentenced, U.S. Attorney
Breckinridge Willcox said at the hearing.
   Prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46
months, roughly three to four years, in prison. The two charges to
which she pleaded guilty carry a maximum sentence of 13 years in
prison and $500,000 in fines. Willcox said prosecutors would also
recommend a fine but had not yet determined how large a one they
would recommend.
   If convicted on all counts, she would have faced a maximum of 31
years in prison and more than $1 million in fines.
   Asked by U.S. District Judge Herbert F. Murray how she felt,
Harrell replied, ``Terrific, your honor.''
   Harrell, who confessed to government officials in December 1988,
became a symbol of mismanagement at HUD when scandal erupted there
last summer. After her indictment last November, U.S. Attorney
General Richard L. Thornburgh said the case was the single largest
involving the theft of federal funds by an individual.
   Harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely
discussed taking the money in testimony before Congress and in
several nationally televised interviews.
   Prosecutors say Harrell took at least $6.6 million from HUD,
money generated by sales of HUD properties that Harrell handled as
a private escrow agent for the agency.
   Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only $4.75
million in HUD funds. And she said that, contrary to the
prosecutor's assertion that only a little went to charity, in fact
less than 6 percent of the money benefited her family.
   Harrell said she hopes to be sentenced to perform community
service, but regards prison as a chance to get a college degree.
   ``I told the kids (her son, John, and his wife, Vicki), just
think of it as Mom going away a few years for college,'' said
Harrell, who will become a grandmother sometime next month.
   Harrell, who lives in Waldorf, a small town in southern
Maryland, said she has prepared herself for imprisonment since
1985, when she started diverting HUD funds.
   ``I never did have a problem with pleading guilty on No. 1, the
embezzlement charge,'' Harrell said last week. ``Obviously, that's
something that's known nationwide.
   ``I really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of
my life to help some of the people I've helped,'' she said.
   Prosecutors had said earlier that she had taken at least $5.6
million, but they revised the figure today after identifying six
more properties for which she allegedly did not turn settlement
proceeds over to the government.
   A handful of supporters who said they had benefited from her
charitable contributions attended the hearing. One held up a large
card that said, ``Marilyn, we are remembering you.''
   ``I thought I'd get caught a long time ago,'' Harrell said after
the hearing. ``I figured I was history and would help as many as I
could before I went down.'' Asked if she was sorry, she said, ``Of
course I'm sorry. It was not a good thing to do.''
   She has said in the past that she was a born-again Christian who
took the money to help people in the name of Christ.

<HEAD>World Earthquakes, Deaths Down in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of significant earthquakes was down
last year despite the World Series quake in California, and total
deaths were well below average, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.
   Earthquake fatalities worldwide totaled 526 last year, well
below the long-term average of 10,000 deaths per year.
   The Oct. 17 California quake, which has been named the Loma
Prieta quake, killed 62 people, injured an estimated 3,500 and
caused damage totaling at least $5.6 billion.
   In 1988, tremors claimed some 28,000 lives, most in the
earthquake that struck Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7 of that year.
   Overall there were 55 significant earthquakes last year, six
fewer than in 1988. On average the world had about 60 significant
quake a year.
   A significant quake is defined as one that registers at least
6.5 on the Richter scale, or one that has a lower reading but which
causes casualties or significant damage.
   In addition to the World Series quake there were five other
significant quakes in the United States last year, including one in
the Los Angeles area on Aug. 8 that claimed one life. The others
were felt in Hawaii on June 26, Southern California on Jan. 19,
Alaska on Sept. 4 and the Aleutian Islands on Oct. 7.
   Last year's deadliest quake occurred Jan. 22, killing 274
persons in the Tajik region of the Soviet Union. Ninety died in
Iran in a quake that struck on Aug. 1.
   The strongest tremor of the year occurred May 23 in the South
Pacific. It was a so-called Great quake, measuring 8.3 on the
Richter scale.
   That scale measures the strength of earthquakes as shown by
ground motion. Each increase of one whole number indicates 10 times
more ground motion. Thus a quake of 6.3 is 10 times more powerful
than one of 5.3.

   Poor leadership, not racism, was the
main cause of a riot during a Labor Day weekend gathering of black
college students, an independent panel has concluded.
   The panel concluded that race became a factor only after
violence began between students and police, according to a report
published Sunday by The Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star newspaper
of Norfolk.
   Two days of looting during a gathering of 100,000 students from
predominantly black universities and other young people last
September cost taxpayers more than $1 million. The violence during
``Greekfest'' damaged 124 stores in Virginia Beach, and 50 people
were injured in clashes with police and National Guardsmen.
   Jack Gravely, president of the state National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, said today that his group
supports the basic findings and conclusion of the report.
   Gravely, however, said there were some holes in the report
concerning the arrest and detention policies of the various law
enforcement agencies involved.
   ``I think the police departments were let off the hook. ...
We're not finished with Virginia Beach,'' he said.
   According to the Norfolk newspaper, the Labor Day Review
Commission determined that poor preparation, failure of
communication and criminal actions by a small percentage of the
crowd were responsible for the violence.
   The commission's report was to be formally presented to Virginia
Beach officials this afternoon. City officials have said they won't
comment until the report is released officially at that time.
   The report said most police officers acted responsibly and
professionally, but it urged officials to review films of the
violence and consider disciplining officers who violated procedures.
   ``We believe some arrests were mistakenly made, a few officers
used inappropriate force, and some subjected residents and visitors
alike to abusive language,'' the newspaper quoted the commission
report as saying.
   Once the violence began, the report said, ``Race then became ...
a way to differentiate potential friends and foes.''
   Better preparations by city officials could have helped head off
problems during the gathering, the commission said.
   ``We believe that City Council and the mayor should have been
more active and should have exerted greater leadership,'' the
report said.
   ``That sounds like a pretty fair assessment,'' L. Victor
Collins, who was director of minority student affairs at Old
Dominion University in Norfolk at the time of the riots, said
Sunday.
   The report recommended ways to promote a peaceful gathering as
thousands of students are expected to return to the beach this
September.
   ``It must be understood that a repeat of Labor Day 1989 would,
without doubt, strike a major blow to race relations in the city,
the region and the commonwealth'' of Virginia, the report said.
   Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said city officials want to make this
year's Greekfest a success.
   ``We want to make September 1990 a win-win situation,'' she said.
   The report said city officials were out of touch with the
gathering's practical problems and racial implications, but it also
condemned the looting and violence.
   ``No amount of rationalization can excuse the behavior of those
individuals who destroyed, looted, and generally violated the
bounds of decency that circumscribe the actions of all who live in
a civilized society,'' it said.
   The report urged appointment of an interracial committee _
including representatives of the city, area colleges and
universities, and student, civil rights, business and religious
groups _ to plan this year's festival.

<TEXT>
   The Communists dissolved their 41-year-old
party today and split into two pro-reform groups that will try to
find a place in the East bloc's first democracy.
   Former Communists today chose Aleksander Kwasniewski, a
35-year-old sports official, to lead the new ``Social Democracy of
the Republic of Poland.'' Most of the former Communist Party
members joined the party.
   But a more radical reformer backed by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, former Gdansk party chief Tadeusz Fiszbach, broke away from
the larger group and created a smaller party, called the
Social-Democratic Union, that he said would not be tainted by the
Old Guard.
   Poland has led the past year's whirlwind of democratic reform in
the East bloc, and its Communist Party became the second in the
Warsaw Pact after Hungary to disband in an attempt to distance
itself from a repressive past.
   Hungary's Communists dissolved their party in October, a month
after the Solidarity movement took control of Poland's government
and ended 40 years of Communist rule. Hungary is to hold free
elections on March 25. Poland held elections in June, when
Solidarity-backed candidates won all but one of the seats they
contested.
   The Social Democrats elected Kwasniewski, who is close to the
former Communist leadership, as their first chairman. Leszek
Miller, a former Communist Party secretary, was chosen as general
secretary.
   Kwasniewski received 1,049 votes and Miller 926 votes out of
1,196 votes cast. There were three candidates for each position.
   ``We feel very moved by this election, and also terrified,
because we are aware of the immense tasks,'' Kwasniewski told the
delegates. ``I hope we can do together what we have to.''
   Kwasniewski, who directs the government's sports committee, has
said he wants a party capable of rallying leftist opinions and
winning popular backing following the demise of the Communist Party.
   ``The most important thing is votes, not members. The better
party is one with 100,000 members and (capable of getting) 1
million votes than a party with 1 million members and only 100,000
votes,'' he said before the vote.
   The latter case described the old Communist Party, he said.
   On Sunday, the main body of Communists voted 1,228-32 to create
a new party with a platform calling for a multiparty system,
respect for human rights and a market economy with some state
ownership of capital.
   In a resolution, it called for ``further strengthening of ties''
with all the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and endorsed
the idea of a ``common European home.''
   However, it also said unemployment should not be accepted as a
permanent part of the economy and that work is ``a natural right of
man'' _ a clear attack on the Solidarity-led government's crash
transformation of a centrally planned economy to free market
capitalism.
   The platform's final resolution accepted responsibility for a
legacy of failures during the four decades the party held absolute
power in Poland, from the crimes of the Stalinist era to the
country's current economic crisis.
   The Communists' last stronghold in Poland is on the local level,
where elections are slated for April, and their leaders
acknowledged a fresh start was needed if they are to have any
chance.
   The new party inherits the disputed property and employees of
its predecessor, formally known as the Polish United Workers Party.
   Walesa today accused the party of ``political arrogance'' for
taking over the holdings of the Communist Party.
   In a statement issued in Gdansk, Walesa said, ``The illegally
acquired property of the former (Communist Party) belongs to the
whole society. That is why none of the newly created parties has
the right to take possession.''
   Young demonstrators forced their way into the provincial
Communist Party headquarters in Gdansk _ the northern port where
Solidarity was born in 1980 labor unrest _ on Sunday and occupied
the building, demanding it be turned over for public use.
   In the southern city of Krakow, an attack on a party building
shattered ground-floor windows, the official news agency PAP
reported.
   Anti-communist demonstrators have briefly occupied party
buildings in cities nationwide over the last month, demanding that
party property be returned to the national treasury.
   The Solidarity-led government has formed a commission to review
the legal status of the buildings, businesses and other Communist
holdings.
   At the party congress, Fiszbach and about 100 followers declared
formation of their own Social Democratic Union based on
``completely different organizational and financial principles.''
   Fiszbach, a parliamentary deputy who quit his regional party
chief job after the 1981 martial law crackdown on Solidarity,
denounced what he called ``artificial unity'' and said it was
impossible that all the old Communists had instantly become
believers in democracy.
   The Social Democratic Union's founders included about two doze
formerly Communist members of parliament. In a statement, the
breakaway party said it would call a nationwide congress in coming
months and likely field candidates in the local elections.
   In his outgoing speech, the old Communist Party's first
secretary, Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, said the party ``played a great
historical role in the Polish state.''
   ``We are not putting it into a coffin but are closing a chapter
of the Polish revolutionary movement,'' Rakowski said just before
the party's red-and-gold flag was carried out of the congress hall
for the last time.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel today
offered to mediate peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, and his spokesman said PLO leader Yasser Arafat has been
invited to visit.
   Havel said his intention was to help make up for the decades of
Czechoslovak passivity regarding the Middle East.
   ``We are all responsible for the situation in the world,'' said
the leader of Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist government. ``For
years we have been doing nothing. We were a mere passive colony.''
   Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres visited Prague on Jan. 21 to
discuss restoration of diplomatic ties, which were severed in 1967
over the Middle East War.
   On Thursday, Havel met with the Palestine Liberation
Organization's envoy to Prague, Samil Abdul Fattah.
   Havel's spokesman, Michael Zantovsky, said the offer to mediate
Israeli-Palestinian talks was contingent on approval from both
sides.
   Zantovsky said Havel invited Arafat to visit Czechoslovakia but
gave no date.
   Israel has refused to meet with the PLO, claiming it is a
terrorist organization.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been trying to
get Israeli and Palestinian leaders to meet to discuss Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Last week, Havel offered Prague as the site of the next
superpower summit, but U.S. and Soviet officials at a meeting in
December decided to hold the next summit in the United States.
   Also today, Interior Minister Richard Sacher said legislation
strictly controlling gun ownership is to be submitted to Parliament
and two commissions will be established to supervise the police.

<HEAD>Leader of North African Jews Calls For Talks With PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NETIVOT, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A charismatic spiritual leader who has
wide support among Israel's predominantly hard-line North African
Jews on Monday called for a Palestinian state and talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We've had enough wars and bloodshed. We are ready to talk even
with those who murdered some of our sons,'' said Rabbi Baruch
Abu-Hatzera, known as Baba Baruch.
   The rabbi, who had made similar comments earlier this month,
spoke in an interview before joining thousands of pilgrims for the
annual ``Hilula,'' a county fair-style memorial for his father and
revered holy man, Rabbi Israel Abu-Hatzera, who was known as ``Baba
Sali.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc
and a past ally, was so angered by the rabbi's statements that he
canceled his visit to the Hilula at the last minute.
   The rift opened the door for the left-of-center Labor Party that
could improve its elections chances with the support of the
traditionally conservative North Africans, particularly those from
Abu-Hatzera's Moroccan community.
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, the Labor Party boss and Shamir's
rival, attended the memorial for the elder Abu-Hatzera and
delivered a speech.
   ``This has great importance for the next elections,'' said Rabbi
Benjamin Chen, an aide to Baba Baruch. ``There are about 800,000
North Africans in Israel. They will remember that Shamir didn't
come to honor the memory of Baba Sali.''
   The North Africans constitute a large segment of the Sephardim,
or Jews from Middle East countries, who in recent years have become
a majority among the nation's 3.5 million Jews. Ashkenazim, or
European Jews, have been more supportive of the Labor Party.
   Reactions to Baba Baruch's new politics were mixed among the
thousands of North African pilgrims who flocked to a white-domed
mausoleum on a muddy hilltop in this Negev Desert town to mark the
sixth anniversary of Baba Sali's death.
   ``We should talk to the PLO if that brings peace. My youngest
son will be drafted in two years, and I'm already sick with
worry,'' said Rina, a 55-year-old mother of six from the nearby
town of Beersheba, touching the white marble grave.
   Rina, who like the other pilgrims ascribes miraculous powers to
Baba Sali and Baba Baruch, said she prayed for peace at the grave.
She then placed a soft-drink bottle filled with water on the grave,
saying it would become holy and rinse away ailments.
   Pilgrim David Daninu criticized Baba Baruch, saying he should
not mix religion and politics.
   ``If we are good Jews, God will help us. Baba Baruch should not
try to be a politician. Many people think it's not good what he
did,'' said Daninu, 63, a retired turkey farmer from Moshav Bnosh,
an agricultural settlement.
   Daninu, clutching a green plastic basket with sandwiches,
shouted over the Arabic music blaring from booths where vendors who
sold everything from Baba Sali pictures, prayer caps and holy books
to perfume, detergent and sweaters.
   Baba Baruch retained several hard-line elements in his peace
plan. He wants Israel to annex the West Bank, considered by
right-wingers part of the biblical land of Israel, and establish a
Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and adjoining parts of Egypt.
West Bank Palestinians would be urged to resettle in the new
Palestinian state, a proposal most would likely reject.
   ``They should build cities in Gaza, in Al Arish and other areas
under Egyptian control,'' said the black-robed rabbi, speaking in
his home overlooking the mausoleum.
   Housing Minister David Levy, a hawkish member of Shamir's Likud,
attended the memorial and said Shamir ``erred in attributing too
much to what (Baruch) said.''
   ``It is not he (Baruch) who will dictate to the government of
Israel with whom to speak or determine the future of the land of
Israel,'' said Levy, an immigrant from Morocco.

   President Bush's $1.23 trillion budget drew a
skeptical response from several Democrats in Congress today with
one senator describing it as ``another fraud'' and a House leadthe United
States to scale back its
military presence.
   Bush's budget for fiscal year 1991 slows growth in military
spending and dictates no general tax increase as part of a plan to
cut the federal budget deficit in half. The defense budget is a
suggested $303.3 billion, a rise of 2.3 percent from this year's
$296.3 billion but a decrease of 2 percent after inflation, figured
at 4.3 percent, is taken into account.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said the budget is a
``listen-to-what-I-say-and-forget-what-I-do budget.''
   He said the figures translate into ``huge fiscal problems
ahead'' without a change in course.
   ``The low aspirations of this document may put a very low
ceiling on what we can expect to accomplish with the deficit this
year,'' he said.
   Bush's budget projects a 1991 deficit of $63.1 billion, far
below this year's estimated $123.8 billion deficit. Bush said his
plan would balance the budget by 1993, the same year the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires a balanced budget.
   Hollings said the administration's 1991 figures have a
``starting line some $20 billion ahead of where they really are.''
He was skeptical about the White House proposal of adding to
federal revenues with items such as ``asset sales.''
   The House Democratic whip, Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania,
said he wouldn't call the budget ``dead on arrival, but we've got
to take a closer look at the specifics. ... It's got to be looked
at; it's got to be examined.''
   He questioned Bush's underlying economic assumptions, saying
they were ``quite rosy,'' at a time when ``all the indicators
indicate that we're not going to have that kind of growth,
interest, inflation that the administration is saying.''
   Moreover, Gray said some of the ways Bush plans to raise money _
such as collecting user fees from boaters _ are simply ``taxes on
working-class Americans'' that have been rejected by Congress in
the past.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who recently generated intense
controversy in Congress by proposing a $62 billion cut in Social
Security taxes this year and next, noted that Bush wants to balance
the budget in 1993, the year after the next presidential election.
   ``It is well known that the federal budget is always in balance
three years from now, never now,'' Moynihan said.
   Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, said the
Democrats obviously have ``a little bit different idea of where the
priorities ought to be.''
   ``We'll have the usual kind of argument throughout the year and
hopefully we'll just get done in time,'' Michel said. House members
all face re-election this year.

   New information appears to clear a man who has
spent almost eight years in prison for a grocery store robbery, and
prosecutors will ask the state parole board to pardon him, a
district attorney said today.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said police will be
giving his office new information that will enable prosecutors to
seek Michael Anthony Woten's release. Woten had been sentenced to
55 years.
   ``We will ask for it just as soon as the Dallas Police
Department furnishes us information on the case, if they haven't
already,'' said Vance. ``Then, we will be in the process of doing
that in the next day or two.
   ``I believe my prosecutor has already confirmed it with the
police. We are just waiting for the police to physically give it to
us so that we will be knowledgeable enough to ask the governor and
Board of Pardons and Paroles to pardon him.''
   The Dallas Times Herald reported Sunday that new evidence places
Woten with a truck driver on the outskirts of Oklahoma City at the
time a Dallas Safeway supermarket was robbed on April 16, 1982.
   Vance said prosecutors will send a letter to the parole board
``setting out the facts as we know them'' and asking it to
recommend to Gov. Bill Clements that Woten be given a full pardon.
   ``I wish that somebody in the process had found that evidence in
1982 and convinced us not to file the case in the first place,''
Deputy Police Chief Ray Hawkins told the Times Herald.
   Woten, 36, expressed disbelief when told by the newspaper that
he might soon be a free man.
   ``Is this for sure?'' he asked. ``In all honesty, this has
happened so fast, you know ... They're not going to change their
minds, are they?''
   The Times Herald's two-month investigation began after Woten
wrote to the newspaper, claiming his innocence. He enclosed an
affidavit from fellow inmate Russell Everett Chamberlain, which
said Chamberlain committed the robbery.
   Earlier this month, Hawkins ordered a detective to reinvestigate
the case. But he told the Times Herald that Chamberlain's
confession would not be enough to win Woten's freedom.
   Then, last week a Times Herald reporter interviewed a crucial
witness _ in the presence of a Dallas police detective.
   Former trucker Don ``Kangaroo'' Fainter remembered picking up
Woten in Oklahoma City and confirmed much of Woten's alibi that he
was hitchhiking to St. Louis the day two gunmen took $5,200 from
the Safeway.
   Fainter, who now runs a gift shop in Claycomo, Mo., recalls
details of the nine-hour trip with Woten. ``I gave him a ride. I'd
swear to that,'' he said.
   During his trial, Woten testified that at the time of the
robbery he was hitchhiking with a truck driver who introduced
himself as Don and used the CB handle ``Kangaroo.'' However,
Woten's attorney couldn't find the truck driver.
   Fainter came forward after hearing of an ad the Times Herald
placed this month in a truckers' publication, searching for
``Kangaroo.'' He said he doesn't understand why he wasn't found and
asked to testify in 1982.
   ``I don't know why they couldn't find me. I was right here,''
Fainter said.
   Evidence of the trip was found in the Centerville, Ky., office
where Fainter's former employer stored company records.
   The Woten case is latest in a string of dubious convictions in
Dallas County.
   Randall Dale Adams, subject of the film ``The Thin Blue Line,''
was freed last year after spending 13 years in prison after he was
convicted of killing a Dallas police officer. He came within three
days of the death penalty, and his conviction was finally
overturned after his case gained publicity from the documentary.
   Lenell Geter was cleared of armed robbery charges in 1984 after
he spent 16 months behind bars.
   And Joyce Ann Brown was freed in November after spending nine
years in prison on an aggravated robbery conviction. After her
conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,
prosecutors said they may try her again.

<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Congress today to trim
defense spending next year by 2 percent after inflation because of
what the Defense Department called ``phenomenal changes'' sweeping
the Soviet bloc and diminished chances of a major land war in
Europe.
   ``The likelihood of a Warsaw Pact attack on NATO at this point
is obviously very remote,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said at a
briefing on the Pentagon's proposed $292.1 billion budget for
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   Cheney said some changes in U.S. defense spending are in order
because of budget constraints. But he cautioned against wholesale
cuts in major weapons programs given the ``enormous uncertainty''
surrounding political developments in the Soviet Union.
   In his budget proposals to Congress, Bush and Cheney outlined a
smaller U.S. military force, paring 38,000 men and women from the 2
million in uniform and calling for elimination of several weapons
systems, as well as the shutdown or reduction of 55 military bases
at home and 14 overseas.
   At the same time, the Bush administration called for five costly
new B-2 stealth bombers, another $1 billion Trident submarine and
funds for two controversial intercontinental nuclear missile
systems. The president also proposed an additional $900 million for
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``We've seen phenomenal changes,'' Cheney said, noting that many
of the Warsaw Pact's leadership has been swept from power in a
pro-democracy tidal wave in the past year. He also noted reductions
in Soviet military spending.
   But Cheney said any attempt to reduce U.S. military strength
because of the budget squeeze ``has to be done carefully,
cautiously, it has to be done deliberately.''
   Bush's budget plan is certain to provoke a blistering battle on
Capitol Hill, where lawmakers cut Bush's request for SDI funds last
year, and are unlikely to embrace military base closings in their
own districts.
   ``We cannot responsibly reduce the defense budget without
looking at bases and production lines,'' Cheney said in a statement
released with a list of targeted installations that ranged from the
Army's Fort Ord near Monterey, Calif., to the sprawling repair
docks at the Philadelphia naval shipyard.
   The Pentagon gave no estimate of eventual cost savings from the
base closings, which require congressional appropriations for the
initial expense of shutting them down.
   Cheney said in a statement that the Pentagon budget ``represents
the first steps in responding to changes in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, as well as tighter budget constraints. Our response
includes reducing force levels, closing military bases and ending
weapons programs.''
   To help reduce spending, Cheney planned to announce later today
a sweeping list of bases to be closed or reduced over the next five
years, from Philadelphia to Long Beach, Calif., and overseas.
   The base closing proposals, some already publicized, have drawn
angry protests from lawmakers whose congressional districts would
be affected.
   The Pentagon's fiscal 1991 budget plan for the 12 months
starting Oct. 1 shows an increase in current outlays of $286.8
billion in outlays _ a 2 percent reduction after adjusting for
anticpated inflation. The administration projects a 4.3 percent
inflation rate for the coming year.
   The Pentagon is seeking overall budget authority of $295.1
billion, up from this year's $291.4 billion. That figure does not
include $11.1 million in spending for the nuclear weapons programs
administered by the Energy Department.
   Looking ahead, Cheney projected a 2 percent decline in defense
spending over the next five years.
   ``By 1995, defense spending will be at its lowest level,
measured either as a share of (the total economy) or as a portion
of total federal spending, since before World War II,'' Cheney said.
   The fiscal 1991 plan calls for cutting active-duty armed forces
by 38,000 men and women, trimming civilian Defense Department
employees by 5,000 and reducing reserve forces by 3,000.
   Two Army divisions would be disbanded by the end of the year.
They are the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 9th
Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Wash.
   Production of the Army's M-1 tank would end after 225 are turned
out this year.
   The Navy would lose two of its four battleships from the World
War II era, the USS Iowa and USS New Jersey, for an estimated
savings of $75 million. Eight older attack submarines would be
deactivated and two nuclear cruisers would be retired. Fourteen
B-52s also would be withdrawn from service.
   Overall, Cheney said he wanted to terminate 20 weapons programs
in an attempt to save $2.9 billion.
   Among them are the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft, the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Phoenix and Maverick
missiles, the Apache helicopter, the Army Helicopter Improvement
Program and the F-15E fighter.
   Congress last year rejected the administration's attempt to
eliminate the Osprey and ordered F-14D production to end after
several years.
   The administration's move to protect several big-ticket weapons
programs from the budget ax faces opposition in Congress.
   The budget plan includes five B-2 stealth bombers costing a
total of $5.5 billion. The batwinged, radar-evading plane has given
lawmakers ``sticker shock'' with its $530 million price tag.
Congress approved two of the three stealth bombers requested last
year, but the addition of five more is certain to be resisted.
   Funds for SDI, a space-based anti-missile system, would be
increased by $900 million to $4.5 billion. Together with about $300
million in Energy Department money, the program would get $4.8
billion under the budget plan, $1 billion more than Congress
approved last year.
   Another controversial administration request is $202 million in
continued financing of two land-based ICBMs, the rail-based,
multiple-warhead MX missile and the truck-based, single-warhead
Midgetman.
   Another costly budget request is $1.5 billion for one Trident
submarine and $1.7 billion for 52 Trident II nuclear missiles.
   The budget includes $1.2 billion to involve the U.S. military
more deeply in Bush's anti-drug war and a 3.5 percent military pay
raise.
   Many legislators are expected to demand more drastic cuts in
defense spending in anticipation of a supposed ``peace dividend.''
Cheney has been accused of lacking a strategic plan for responding
to recent political upheavals in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   But Cheney defended his budget plan as providing ``careful,
orderly, prudent'' reductions at a time of international
uncertainty. He has said this is ``the worst possible time to
contemplate changes in defense strategy.''

   The trial of Joseph Hazelwood got under
way today with the judge predicting it would take a ``fairly long
time'' to select a jury to weigh the charges against the former
tanker captain in the nation's worst oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone spent much of the morning
briefing reporters on courtroom rules in the highly publicized case.
   Hazelwood, 43, faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and
misdemeanor charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated,
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. He was the
captain of the Exxon Valdez when the tanker ran aground March 24,
spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   Johnstone said jury selection in the case would not begin until
Tuesday, and that he would spend the rest of today on pretrial
motions. In motions similar to ones that have been rejected in the
past, Hazelwood's lawyers are seeking again to have his failed
sobriety test prohibited as evidence and challenging the state's
jurisdiction in the case.
   ``I expect jury selection will take a fairly long time,''
Johnstone said, estimating it could take two weeks.
   About 90 prospective jurors have been given standard, three-page
questionnaires and about 30 a day will be questioned, the judge
said. A larger number will be screened if a panel of 12 plus
alternates cannot be found from the pool of 90 people.
   Johnstone said he expects each side in the case to spend about
three weeks presenting arguments.
   Largely for reasons of fairness, the trial was moved here from
Valdez, the port where the Exxon Valdez took on its cargo of North
Slope crude hours before the tanker struck charted Bligh Reef.
   Before he left his home state of New York to come here to face
trial, Hazelwood said said he looked forward to arguing that the
spill was a ``tragic accident,'' not a criminal act.
   ``I'd like to get rid of the misconception that I got drunk, ran
the ship aground, and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away _
because that's just not what happened,'' Hazelwood said in an
interview with The Associated Press last week in his New York
lawyer's office.
   Hazelwood, who was not on the bridge when the accident occurred,
failed a blood-alcohol test 10 hours after the Exxon Valdez struck
Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound.
   The spill killed thousands of animals and disrupted commercial
fishing seasons. Exxon says the cleanup has cost $2 billion.
   The charges carry combined penalties of up to seven years, three
months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson planned to argue that Hazelwood
left clear instructions for the crew and cannot be held criminally
responsible for their actions. Third Mate Gregory Cousins was at
the wheel of the 987-foot vessel when it ran aground after leaving
designated shipping lanes.
   Cousins was expected to testify. He was served with a subpoena
in Tampa, Fla., on Friday at the request of Assistant District
Attorney Brent Cole, the Hazelwood prosecutor.
   Cole alleged that Cousins was not licensed to navigate in Prince
William Sound. Cousins declined to comment before the trial.
   In an affidavit, Cole also alleged that Hazelwood was seen
drinking at two bars within three hours before his ship left the
port of Valdez.
   Other witnesses Madson said he will call include other crew
members and an expert who will describe a computer simulation of
the ship's course and testify that the Exxon Valdez would have
cleared Bligh Reef had the crew followed Hazelwood's instructions.
   The trial, originally scheduled for October in Valdez, was
delayed as courts dealt with reassigning judges, processing thick
legal motions and other matters.
   The trial was moved to Anchorage on grounds a fair proceeding
could not be obtained in Valdez, and because Alaska's largest city
has a substantial jury pool and facilities for news media.
   Hazelwood was expected to be in the courtroom throughout the
trial.
   Since being fired, the seaman from Huntington, N.Y., has been
working as a lobsterman. Before his tanker ran aground, the longest
he had been ashore since he was an adolescent was two or three
months.
   ``I get stark crazy when I am too far from the salt water,'' he
said, chain-smoking during the interview.
   Hazelwood said he was confident that once Alaskans heard the
case against him ``they will agree that this was a tragic accident,
nothing more.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed closing
or realigning more than 60 military bases in the United States and
12 installations overseas today as part of a cost-saving effort.
   ``These proposed actions are part of an ongoing effort to
streamline Defense Department operations in keeping with changing
requirements and future budget realities,'' Cheney told Capitol
Hill lawmakers in a letter that accompanied his list.
   Cheney released the list of suggested targeted military sites at
a Pentagon briefing, in which he also discussed his $292.1 billion
fiscal 1991 spending plan.
   Among the domestic bases affected are several in California,
including Fort Ord, which played a major role in the recent
invasion of Panama; Alameda Naval Aviation Depot, Oakland's Naval
Supply Center, Moffett Field Naval Air Station and Long Beach Naval
Shipyard.
   The overseas bases include seven in Europe, four in Asia and a
Naval Air Station in Bermuda.
   The European bases include two in Greece _ Hellenikon Air Base
and NAVCOMMSTA in Makri; one in West Germany _ Zweibrucken Air
Base; three in England _ RAF Fairford, Greenham Common and
Wethersfield; and one in Italy _ Comiso Air Base.
   Comiso and Greenham Common are home to Air Force cruise missile
installations that are being dismantled under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union,
signed in December 1987.
   The Asian bases on Cheney's list are a Navy base in San Miguel,
Philippines and three in South Korea _ Kwang Ju, Suwon and Taeguak.
   ``No final decision has been made regarding closure, reduction
or realignment of installations,'' the Navy documents on the
closings said.
   The Army cuts also apply to a number of reserve units, including
some in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois,
Kentucky, Maryland and Michigan.
   Reports of Cheney's proposed closures have circulated for
several days on Capitol Hill, where they set off heated protests
from lawmakers and prompted a warning from Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, that the
shutdowns must not be partisan if the Pentagon hopes to achieve any
cuts.
   However, to discourage leaks, Pentagon officials waited until
the weekend to print the entire base closure list, and the
secretary was to discuss his reasoning behind the base erasures at
a two-hour press conference today.
   Cheney's list is only a suggestion, however. Since it costs
money to shut bases down and legislation is necessary to accomplish
the complex feat, the savings are not usually accrued until years
later.
   In actuality, Cheney's list is a proposal to study which bases
should be eliminated. Closing a base also requires a lengthy series
of environmental impact statements which often lead to delays.

<HEAD>Social Democrat Leader Endorses Lafontaine as Top Opposition
Canidate</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition politician Oskar Lafontaine
won a key endorsement Monday in his bid to be the main challenger
to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in December's elections.
   Lafontaine, the governor of Saarland state, led the Social
Democrats to a lopsided victory over Kohl's conservative party in
state elections.
   On Monday, Social Democratic Party chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel
announced he was backing Lafontaine as the party's choice to
challenge Kohl. He said Lafontaine is a politician ``who can speak
to the people and who can convince them.''
   Vogel said the party's board will discuss Lafontaine's candidacy
in March.
   A final decision will be made at a special national party
congress in autumn, but Vogel's endorsement along with those from
other influential Social Democrats is likely to assure Lafontaine
of the candidacy.
   The independent-minded, leftist Lafontaine is the party's deputy
chairman.
   The Saarland governor told reporters he would take a three-week
vacation to consider whether he would accept the party's
nomination. But in recent weeks, Lafontaine has clearly stated he
was willing to try to unseat Kohl.
   Lafontaine's already good prospects of becoming the Social
Democrats' standard bearer received a major boost after he led the
party to a resounding victory in Sunday's local elections.
   Nationally known and respected as a tough career politician,
Lafontaine is expected to be a strong challenger to Kohl's bid for
a third four-year term as the West German leader.
   Lafontaine, 46, handed Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic
Union the latest in a string of local setbacks. The Free Democrats,
Kohl's centrist partner in the governing Bonn coalition, also lost
seats.
   Sunday's vote in Saarland was an unexpectedly strong endorsement
for Lafontaine's entry into national politics, as the Social
Democrats widened its absolute majority in the state parliament.
   The Social Democrats polled 54.4 percent, compared with 33.4
percent for the Christian Democrats and 5.6 percent for the Free
Democrats.
   According to preliminary official results, the Social Democrats
won 30 of the state parliament's 51 seats, a gain of four. The
Christian Democrats won 18, down two, while the Free Democrats
dropped from five to three seats.
   For Kohl, it was a damper after last fall's sudden democratic
changes in East Germany stirred hopes for German reunification and
boosted the chancellor's standing.
   Lafontaine's campaign focused on the economic and social impacts
of the wave of East Germans resettling in West Germany. The
election outcome illustrates the public's growing resentment of the
influx.
   Lafontaine has urged that generous federal and state benefits
for East German immigrants be cut to encourage them to stay at home
and work for democratic change.
   He said Sunday night that the Saarland vote was a warning to
Bonn.
   ``A majority of the population does not tolerate that one talks
about future forms of statehood but not about current social
problems,'' he told West German TV. ``It is nonsensical to offer
bounties for leaving (East Germany).''
   About 47,000 East Germans have fled political and economic
uncertainty in their Communist-dominated homeland since Jan. 1, and
as many as 2,000 arrive daily. Nearly 344,000 migrated to West
Germany last year, putting great strain on social services and
housing markets.
   Lafontaine recently called himself a ``German patriot in the
tradition of enlightenment and tolerance.''
   Vogel has predicted ``outstanding achievements'' for Lafontaine,
who began a meteoric political career at age 21 in the party youth
organization. In Saarbruecken, he became the youngest mayor of any
West German city at age 32.
   When he was voted deputy chairman of the Social Democrats in
1987, he had become known as a gadfly opposed particularly to the
party's conservative wing led by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   Lafontaine vocally opposed plans to station U.S. medium-range
nuclear missiles in West Germany, pushed by Schmidt in the late
1970s.

<HEAD>State Department Praises East German Elections Action; Cautions
Romanians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday praised East
Germany's decision to move up national elections to March and
cautioned the interim rulers of Romania against backsliding from
the country's revolution.
   Privately, U.S. officials were relieved that the East German
government had decided not to wait until May 6 to hold the
elections. They had rated the Communist goverment's chances of
surviving until then as no better than 50-50.
   Those chances may have been improved by the parallel decision in
East Berlin to form a coalition government until the March 18
elections with opposition elements, a move that effectively ends
the Communists' domination.
   ``They seem to have accelerated the schedule in order to move
quickly to a more stable, more long-term regime that's based on the
popular will. That's something that we support,'' Richard Boucher,
the State Department spokesman, said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited Potsdam last month
to demonstrate U.S. support for the new governnet. He held separate
talks with Premier Hans Modrow and Lutheran clergymen, many of whom
were critics of the ousted hard-line regime.
   Baker is planning to go to Czechoslvakia next week to show
support for the relatively calm transition in that Central European
country. But chances that he might also go to Romania appear to be
slipping in light of unsettled conditions there.
   A final decision is expected shortly.
   The stop in Prague is part of a trip dominated by talks Baker
will hold in Moscow Feb. 7-8 on arms control issues, Afghanistan
and other topics with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   Spokesman Boucher reiterated U.S. support for trends in East
Germany in his statement. ``The United States has, I think, clearly
and consistently favored the process of democratic reform in East
Germany,'' he said. ``We think that only by meeting the desire of
the East German population for reform can stability be maintained.''
   Boucher addes that ``it remains critical that the elections be
genuinely democratic, free and secret.'' He said the decision to
move up the elections was designed to promote stability in East
Germany by establishing a government based on popular will.
   ``We agree that the installation of a legitimate government
based on free elections is the best guarantee of long-term
stability,'' Boucher said.
   Turning to Romania, where an interim government has imposed
restrictions on freedom of assembly, the State Department spokesman
took a cautious stance.
   ``We are carefully watching the almost daily demonstrations in
Bucharest which have protested the predominance of Communists in
the National Salvation Front, and the Front's recent decision to
run candidates in the election scheduled for May 20th,'' he said.
   ``The composition and policies of the Salvation Front will
obviously be important issues in those elections. We call upon all
Romanians both inside and outside the government to conduct
themselves peacefully and in the true spirit of democracy to which
they say they are dedicated,'' Boucher said, reading from a
prepared statement.
   It concluded with this warning: ``There should be no backsliding
on the part of transitional officials as Romania moves from
revolution to democracy.''

<HEAD>Kim Dae-Jung Urges Resistance to Merger of Three Conservative
Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung urged
``democratic'' forces Monday to join him in opposing the merger of
the governing Democratic Justice Party and two conservative
opposition groups.
   The leftist leader called the proposed merger ``a coup d'etat.''
   ``There is no precedent in our nation's political history for
such an infamous and traitorous action,'' he said. ``In a single
day, the ruling party, which had not even a majority, suddenly
became three-quarters of the National Assembly. This is a situation
which makes possible total dictatorship.''
   Changes in the constitution can be made with a two-thirds vote
in the legislature.
   President Roh Tae-woo's party holds 127 of the 299 seats in the
unicameral parliament, compared with 71 for Kim's leftist Party for
Peace and Prosperity. The merged party, to be formed in a month,
would have about 220 seats.
   In a statement he read at a meeting of the Seoul Foreign
Correspondents Club, Kim said his party ``will welcome all
moderate, democratic political forces and will try to be the
people's party.'' He said the proposed new ruling party was
``controlled by the forces of the extreme right.''
   Roh's party intends to join with the Reunification Demcoratic
Party of Kim Young-sam and the New Demcoratic Republican Party, led
by Kim Jong-pil. They are the second- and third-ranked opposition
parties after Kim Dae-jung's.
   During a television appearance a week ago with the two other
Party leaders, Roh said they had agreed to form a new conservative
political group with the aim of bringing stability to South Korea's
faction-ridden politics.
   Kim Dae-jung said Monday that, if the three parties ``insist on
the ... merger, and forcibly change the consitution to allow for a
cabinet system'' to replace the existing presidential system, the
present National Assembly ``must be dissolved'' and the people's
decision sought through elections.
   He claimed the merger was designed to keep him from winning the
next presidential election.
   Roh's term ends in 1993. Kim Dae-jung says he lost the last
presidential election in 1987 because the two other Kims also ran
as opposition candidates, splitting the vote.
   Earlier Monday, the Rev. Park Hyung-kyoo and nine other
dissident Protestant ministers issued a declaration describing the
merger as an attempt ``to block the masses from advancing into
political circles.''
   They said they planned a rally Feb. 13 to oppose the merger, and
predicted 2,000 Christian clerics would attend.
   There have been reports of plans by some junior lawmakers in Kim
Young-sam's party to form a new independent opposition group.

<HEAD>Faulty Air Conditioning Fan to Blame for Cabin Smoke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faulty air-conditioning fan was blamed
Monday for sending smoke into the cabin of a Delta Air Lines jet as
the pilot tried for a third time to make the trip to New York.
   The fan overheated Sunday, spreading smoke in the cabin of
Flight 606 through air-conditioning ducts and forcing an
evacuation, said Sam K. Murphy, district marketing manager for
Delta. There was no fire.
   The flight, bound for LaGuardia Airport, carried 114 passengers
and a crew of eight.
   Four people suffered minor injuries when the passengers and crew
used slides to evacuate the Boeing 727.
   The plane was taxiing at about 1:15 p.m. when the smoke was
detected in the passenger cabin, Murphy said. At that point, he
said, the plane's engines were shut down and the emergency chutes
used.
   ``People were grabbing at the oxygen masks,'' said Christen
Cashman, 21, a student at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. ``I
wasn't really that nervous because there was a businessman next to
us and he told us it was no big deal and these things happen all
the time. Then we lined up and went down the evacuation chute.''
   The aborted takeoff was the plane's third attempt that day.
   The plane had first tried to depart on schedule at 11 a.m., but
returned to the gate before liftoff because of an oil warning light
on engine No. 1, Murphy said.
   Maintenance workers fixed the problem and the plane took off
about a half hour later, he said.
   After about 20 minutes in the air, the same warning light
flashed on for engine No. 3 and the aircraft returned to Tampa
International Airport.
   ``That indicates a potential problem and as a precautionary
measure, (the pilot) returned to have our maintenance people take a
look at it,'' Murphy said.
   As he returned for landing, the pilot _ using standard
procedures _ shut off the engine and dumped a ``significant''
amount of fuel over the Gulf of Mexico, said Paul MacAlester, an
airport spokesman. He says the fuel is dumped to lessen the chances
of fire from landing difficulties.
   ``It would have been enough (fuel) to get from here to La
Guardia and some to spare,'' MacAlester said. ``You do this so you
don't have any more fuel on board than you have to.''
   The jet landed safely and maintenance workers changed the oil
filters in the two other engines. As the plane prepared for take
off an hour later, the smoke was detected and the flight was
grounded.

   President Bush proposed Monday to trim federal
transportation outlays next year to $7.8 billion, but to hire more
employees to handle growing air traffic congestion and detect
safety problems in aging airliners.
   Bush's proposed budget for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1,
calls for a $264 million increase in funds for the Federal Aviation
Administration, a 7 percent boost to $4.1 billion for the agency.
   The higher funds would enable the FAA to hire nearly 500 new air
traffic controllers, 300 new safety inspectors and additional
security specialists. There were 16,921 controllers on the federal
payroll as of Dec. 31.
   ``Additional staff are needed because of projected increases in
aviation activity and because of the aging of the aircraft fleet,''
the FAA said.
   ``The staffing increases will result in the largest air traffic
control work force in the history of the FAA and more than double
the staff devoted to detecting the problems of aging aircraft,''
the agency said.
   The announcement came as federal investigators were exploring an
apparent communications mixup between regional and local New York
air traffic controllers in the crash of a Colombian Avianca
jetliner on Long Island last Thursday, killing 73 people and
injuring 85 others. The plane, which was low on fuel, was trying to
land at Kennedy International Airport.
   Overall, Bush urged reducing Transportation Department outlays
from the current $9.2 million to $7.8 billion next year, and
putting greater reliance on tax-supported highway and aviation
trust funds and public-private enterprises to finance major
transportation improvements.
   The trust funds are supported by a variety of user fees and
excise taxes on such items as gasoline. When they are taken into
account, total transportation spending would rise to $28.7 billion
in fiscal 1991, compared with $28.2 billion this year.
   Other Bush proposals included:
   _A ticket tax or surcharge on departing air passengers to help
finance airport construction and improvements.
   _A fivefold increase in research spending on developing
so-called smart cars and smart highways using ``state-of-the art
electronics, communications and computer technology to improve
traffic control systems (that) warn drivers of dangerous situations
and make more efficient use of the existing road system.''
   _$10 million to assess the potential of a public-private system
of non-polluting, high-speed trains guided by magnets and achieving
maximum speeds of 300 miles per hour.
   The administration proposed a 12 percent increase _ from $6.5
billion to $7.2 billion _ in programs to benefit air travelers, as
part of a long-term plan to modernize aviation facilities, expand
airport capacity and bolster aviation research and development.
   The request for $190 million earmarked for research and
development _ a 12 percent boost in current spending _ would
finance a study of metal fatigue and corrosion in older aircraft
and a new laboratory to perfect airport detection of explosive
devices in luggage.
   It also would pay for development of new ways to prevent
aircraft fires and minimize fire injuries.
   Bush proposed cutting off operating subsidies to mass transit
systems in cities with populations of 1 million or more, saying the
federal contribution represents less than 6 percent of those
budgets.

<HEAD>Increases Reported in Personal Income, Spending</HEAD>

   Consumer spending posted its largest increase
in three years in 1989, the government reported Monday, and
analysts said robust incomes should result in continued purchasing
strength in the first quarter of 1990.
   The Commerce Department said spending totaled $3.47 trillion, a
7.3 percent gain over 1988 and the sharpest advance since a 6.1
percent increase in 1986.
   At the same time, it said personal incomes rose 9 percent to
$4.43 trillion last year, up from 7.6 percent in 1988 and the
fastest advance since rising 9.5 percent in 1984.
   ``You look at those numbers and you kind of wonder why everybody
was talking about recession,'' remarked Michael K. Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting organization. ``Those were pretty good
numbers, especially the growth in income, which was quite robust.''
   The difference between 1989 earnings and purchases helped boost
Americans' savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable income
_ to 5.5 percent from 4.2 percent in 1988. It was the highest rate
since 1984's 6.1 percent.
   Despite the increases in 1989 incomes and consumption, the year
ended on a sluggish note, with economic growth held back by high
interest rates resulting from Federal Reserve efforts to slow
inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit.
   The Commerce Department reported last Friday that the gross
national product grew only 0.5 percent in the October-December
quarter, down from a 3 percent advance in the third quarter. The
report on the GNP _ the nation's total output of goods and services
_ included a rare decline of 0.1 percent in spending in the fourth
quarter.
   The year-end economic sluggishness was further reflected in
Monday's report of a 0.5 percent increase in personal income in
December, down from the 0.9 percent gains in both October and
November. The December figure was the smallest advance since a 0.2
percent rise last September and reflected a seasonally adjusted
annual spending rate of $4.57 trillion.
   ``The December increase was boosted by a return to work
following strikes in the aircraft and telephone industries and was
reduced by decreases in retroactive Social Security benefit
payments and in subsidy payments to farm proprietors,'' the
Commerce Department said.
   But at the same time, consumers increased their spending in
December by 1 percent, up from 0.3 percent in both October and
November and the largest increase since a 1 percent gain in August.
Spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.58
trillion.
   Much of the December increase, Commerce said, was spent on fuel
oil, electricity and natural gas because of unusually cold weather.
   Nevertheless, Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group
here, said consumers still were spending as the year ended,
although cautiously.
   ``We'll see an improvement in consumer spending in the first
quarter'' of 1990, she said. ``We already see an increase in car
sales which made the whole (fourth) quarter look so bad.''
   Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ rose $6.7 billion in December after
declining $2.8 billion the previous month. Non-durable purchases
gained $6.2 billion after a $3.4 billion November increase.
Spending on services increased $24.1 billion following a $9.6
billion advance the previous month.
   Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.4 percent last month,
after a 1 percent gain in November. The key component of the income
category _ wages and salaries _ increased $16.9 billion in
December, reflecting in part the end of the Boeing Co. aircraft
strike. Wages and salaries rose $2 billion in November.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies increased $2.3 billion after
dropping $5.9 billion in November.
   The December savings rate was 5.6 percent, down from 6.2 percent
in November.

<HEAD>Falcons Once Near Extinction Come Back to Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program aimed at bringing the peregrine falcon
back from the brink of extinction in Illinois has reached its goal
a decade earlier than expected, the project director said Monday.
   When the Chicago Peregrine Release program ends this summer, 46
of the crow-sized birds of prey will have been reintroduced into
Illinois, said director Vicki Byre.
   Before the program began in 1986, peregrines had not been seen
in Illinois for 35 years, wiped out by pesticides that damaged
their ability to reproduce, Ms. Byre said in a telephone interview.
   ``By the end of 1960s, peregrines were entirely extinct east of
the Rocky Mountains,'' she said.
   But with the help of projects nationwide, there are now likely
more than 100 breeding pairs east of the Rockies _ and probably
more than that west of the Rockies, she said. Peregrines in the
western United States have fared better because there is less
cropland _ and thus less pesticide use, Ms. Byre said.
   ``It's because of man that they have disappeared so I think we
owe it to our fellow living creatures to help them back,'' she said.
   Changes have been made since the near-demise of the peregrine,
nature's fastest bird and known for making spectacular swoops at
200 mph to catch its prey _ smaller birds _ in flight.
   The pesticide DDT was banned in this country in 1972, and the
federal government declared the falcon an endangered species the
following year.
   The peregrine's natural habitat _ mostly wide open cliffs _ also
has changed. Places where it once roosted have been populated with
homes, trees, and the falcon's most deadly predator _ the great
horned owl, said Carl Becker, chief of the Illinois Department of
Conservation's Division of Natural Heritage.
   So most projects like Chicago's release the birds into urban
``wilds.'' Ornithologists have discovered the lofty ledges of
skyscrapers make ideal homes.
   Under the Chicago program, coordinated by the Chicago Academy of
Sciences and the conservation department, 5-week-old peregrine
chicks raised in captivity are released in groups of about five and
provided with food until they can thrive on their own. Each bird
costs $1,750.
   ``The whole thing that we measure the success of the program by
is not just if you can get them released in the wild but if they
can mate on their own,'' Ms. Byre said.
   So far, peregrines in Illinois have produced at least six young,
she said.
   ``Our goal was to try to get three breeding pairs into Illinois
by the year 2000. The program has reached that goal already because
we do have three pairs,'' Ms. Byre said.
   Once the Chicago program ends, the conservation department will
evaluate whether to attempt peregrine release elsewhere in the
state, Becker said.

<TEXT>
   The Nature Conservancy closed a deal
Monday to acquire the biologically diverse 321,703-acre Gray Ranch
in New Mexico's southwestern boot heel, the environmental
organization said.
   It is the largest land acquisition in the nearly 40-year history
of the non-profit Conservancy, which has protected more than 4
million acres of ecologically significant land across the United
States.
   ``We acted as we did because we were concerned that it (the
ranch) may be sold to another purchaser that may not share the kind
of conservation goals that The Nature Conservancy had,'' said Bill
Waldman of Santa Fe, director of the Conservancy's operations in
New Mexico.
   ``More separate species and subspecies of mammals are found on
the Gray Ranch than on any existing national wildlife refuge or
national park in the continental United States,'' Waldman said from
the group's national headquarters in Arlington, Va.
   The ranch supports an estimated 75 species and subspecies of
mammals, 150 species of birds and 52 kinds of reptiles and
amphibians, said Michele Merola, operations and communications
coordinator for the Conservancy in Santa Fe.
   The animals include three federally endangered species _
Sanborn's long-nosed bat, the bald eagle and the ridge-nosed
rattlesnake.
   The state also has an endangered species list, Ms. Merola said,
and 21 plants and animals from that list are represented at the
ranch, including the white-eared hummingbird, the bunchgrass
lizard, night-blooming cereus, green-flowered fishhook cactus and
the white butterfly cactus.
   In the middle of the ranch south of Lordsburg sit the Animas
Mountains, covered with conifer trees like Douglas fir, pinon and
juniper. The flanks of the mountains give way to oak and shrub oak
that is surrounded by semi-desert grassland, which makes up the
bulk of the ranch.
   Last year, Congress postponed appropriations to buy the ranch
and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. placed an indefinite freeze
on a proposed federal purchase of the ranch for use as a wildlife
refuge.
   Lujan's decision came after he and Gov. Garrey Carruthers toured
the ranch last September. At the time, Lujan expressed concern
about its high cost.
   ``The owners want $23 million, but the appraisal is $16 million
and, by the time they buy surrounding ranches, we're looking at $50
to $60 million instead,'' Lujan said.
   The Nature Conservancy bought the ranch from Gray Land and
Cattle Co., which Waldman said has owned the land for seven or
eight years.
   The price was not revealed, but Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said
last year that the group planned to buy the ranch for an estimated
$18.25 million.
   ``We've been actively involved in pursuit of protecting it for
several years, and we've been negotiating for two years,'' Waldman
said.
   The Nature Conservancy is acquiring 226,664 acres of deeded
land, and will lease the remaining state, private and U.S. Bureau
of Land Management land, Waldman said.
   The ranch was once the property of George Hearst, a California
mining and livestock baron and father of publishing magnate William
Randolph Hearst, the Conservancy said.

<TEXT>
   Jonas Savimbi, the Angolan rebel leader,
said Monday the civil war may end this year because of superpower
pressure and his country's weariness with bloodshed.
   ``The pressure for peace from inside and outside Angola will be
so great, I don't see how either side will be able to continue
fighting in 1990,'' said Savimbi, who has U.S. support. ``We are
going to launch an enormous effort to end the war this year.''
   He spoke to reporters during a tour of Europe that also will
take him to Belgium, Switzerland, West Germany and possibly France,
in search of support for his UNITA guerrilla movement.
   Savimbi has fought the Soviet-backed government since Angola
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   He said UNITA, whose formal name is the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, had been in direct contact with Cuba
to give assurances the rebels would not attack Cuban soldiers
stationed in Angola.
   Last week, Cuba suspended the withdrawal of its troops after
four Cubans where killed in a UNITA raid.
   Reports on Monday from Luanda, the Angolan capital, said Cuban
soldiers killed 33 guerrillas in apparent reprisal for the Jan. 21
rebel attack.
   Cuban soldiers had not been involved in fighting since the
withdrawal began after South Africa pledged in December 1988 to
stop aid to UNITA and grant independence to neighboring Namibia.
Cuba originally had 50,000 soldiers in Angola and an estimated
19,000 remain.
   Savimbi said better superpower relations meant the Kremlin would
support a more active role for the United States in seeking peace.
U.S. envoy Herman Cohen was in London on Monday and reports said he
intended to meet with Soviet officials about Angola.
   A cease-fire signed in June at Gbadolite, Zaire, collapsed
within days. Since December, UNITA has fought off what the rebels
describe as the largest government offensive ever launched against
their strongholds.
   Halting that offensive and arranging talks between Savimbi and
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos should be the next steps, the
rebel leader said.
   ``The Americans and the Portuguese can play a more active role
in the search for peace by establishing where the common ground
between the two sides lies and using that to bring us together,''
he said.
   Savimbi said the United States and Portugal should support peace
efforts by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, who has mediated
between the government and rebels. He said Portugal could serve as
a channel of communication between the sides.
   President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva of
Portugal met with Savimbi separately over the weekend. Jose Durao
Barroso, secretary of state for foreign affairs, flew to London on
Monday for talks with Cohen.
   Savimbi met with Roman Catholic Church leaders and labor union
officials Monday.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission began its annual
session on Monday with a tribute to the late Andrei Sakharov, who
was hailed as a champion of freedom and human rights.
   All members of the 43-nation commission rose after the incumbent
chairman, Marc Bossuyt, asked for a minute of silence in Sakharov's
``memory and as a gesture of gratitutde for all those who
courageously fought for human rights.''
   Bossuyt, a Belgian international law expert, also hailed ``the
courage, clearsightedness and self-sacrifice of political leaders
who dared to abandon the methods of the past to confront realities
... in order to better respond to the needs of the peoples which
they govern.''
   He said the past year had brought success for some human rights
movements, while others ``were drowned in blood.''
   ``In any case, it is clear that the thirst for freedom can move
masses throughout the world,'' he said. ``The last decade of the
20th century has begun with that message.''
   Bossuyt said he believed the commission remained silent on many
past abuses too often. ``Every time a repressive regime collapses
and human rights violations are revealed, there is a certain
embarrassment which some people try to hide in vain by feigning
irgnorance,'' he said.
   ``The commission should concern itself less with the risk of
displeasing some governments which violate human rights and should
be more concerned by the fate of the victims of those violations,''
he said.
   Jan Martenson, U.N. Undersecretary-General for Human Rights,
joined Bossuyt in eulogizing Sakharov. ``We best honor his memory
by maintaining the fight for justice and human dignity in the face
of indifference and intolerance,'' he said .
   The crowded opening meeting was also attended by observers from
many other U.N. member nations and by representatives of more than
100 non-governmental organizations monitoring human rights.
   Purificacion Quisumbing, a senior legal official in the
Philippine government, was elected to chair the 1989 session,
succeeding Bossuyt.
   The commission's agenda covers a wide range of issues, from such
``traditional'' subjects as South Africa and Israel to special
reports on a number of countries, including Iran and Romania, both
non-members.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has been asked to
submit a ``note'' on the situation in China, a member. The note is
to come in response to a cautious resolution adopted by a panel of
the commission last August following the brutal repression of
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   The United States has said it will make a new effort to have the
commission launch a special inquiry into the human rights situation
in Cuba, also a member of the commission.

   Lyndon LaRouche was transported nearly 1,000
miles to testify in the loan-fraud trial of an associate, but the
defense Monday decided against calling the imprisoned political
extremist to the stand.
   ``I didn't need his testimony because there was no dispute on
the evidence I wanted him for,'' said Pat Monaghan, the attorney
representing Donald Phau. Monaghan refused to say what evidence he
was referring to.
   LaRouche will be taken back to a federal prison in Rochester,
Minn.
   Roanoke County Sheriff's Department spokesman James Robertson
would not give a cost estimate for flying LaRouche from Minnesota
and keeping him in the county jail for nearly a week. But he said
the county expects to be reimbursed by either LaRouche or the
defendant.
   Phau is one of 16 members of the LaRouche organization who were
charged three years ago with violating the Virginia Securities Act
by selling and issuing promissory notes for five
LaRouche-affiliated organizations. All of the cases involved
telephone solicitations for loans.
   LaRouche was convicted 13 months ago on federal charges of mail
fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud
the Internal Revenue Service. He was sentenced to 15 years in
prison.

   Artist Mel Bolden figured his portrait of
space shuttle Challenger victim Christa McAuliffe would circulate
around the world, but he didn't expect it to go into orbit.
   He learned Monday that a photograph released by the Soviet news
agency Tass shows a copy of his McAuliffe poster on the wall in the
Soviet MIR space station.
   Orbiting Soviet cosmonauts featured the poster and an official
NASA photograph of the Challenger crew to commemorate their deaths
four years ago Sunday when the shuttle exploded shortly after
launch.
   ``I'm just trying to figure out how they got a copy of the
poster,'' Bolden said. ``It's beyond my wildest dream or
imagination.''
   ``It's an honor,'' he said. ``I'm flabbergasted.''
   Cosmonauts Alexander Serebrv and Alexander Viktorenko conducted
a lesson for children from space Sunday to commemorate the
Challenger anniversary.
   McAuliffe, a Concord High School social studies teacher, was
chosen in 1985 from among 11,000 teachers to be the first ordinary
American to travel in space. Her main mission on the flight was to
have been to conduct classes from orbit to rekindle interest in
space travel.
   Bolden's poster shows a smiling McAuliffe in her blue NASA
flight suit, the shuttle headed for space in the background. It
also incorporates a classroom scene painted in her Concord High
classroom.
   On the blackboard is a simple message: ``Any dream can come true
if you have the courage to work at it.''
   Bolden, who turned 71 on Sunday, the blast anniversary, figures
NASA may have given the Soviets a copy of the poster.
   Bolden said he and McAuliffe worked together to design the
poster, which was intended to be distributed to help raise money
for science scholarships.
   ``We were trying to get across the idea of education,
particularly science education, and trying to inspire kids into
getting into science and math,'' Bolden said.
   After McAuliffe died, Bolden took his idea to Pepsi-Cola Co.,
which bought the portrait and donated it to the Smithsonian
Institution's Air and Space Museum in Washington.
   The MIR station was launched Feb. 20, 1986. The current crew is
the seventh to visit the station. Serebrv and Viktorenko were
launched into space in June for a planned six-month stay in MIR.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said
Monday he had urged the Bush administration to grant American
passports to residents of Hong Kong working for American firms in
order to help the island's transition from British to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   The idea is to reassure islanders that they can stay in Hong
Kong while having a secure fallback of an American passport should
they wish to leave, Hurd told reporters after lunching with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Hurd was meeting President Bush and other leaders on his first
trip to Washington since assuming office last October. His talks
were focused on upcoming changes within the NATO alliance in light
of the changes sweeping away the old order in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   Hurd said that if Hong Kong residents holding key positions
leave the territory, stability could not be maintained during the
complicated transition period. He said he told Baker that ``it
would be enormously helpful'' if the United States provided
passports to islanders working for American firms.
   Britain and other countries would also be providing passports to
Hong Kong residents under this scheme.
   The subject will come up again Tuesday when Hurd holds talks in
Congress, where legislation on the matter is pending.
   Hurd said he had appealed to Baker for U.S. understanding of his
government's handling of more than 40,000 Vietnamese boat people in
Hong Kong.
   The British want to send most of the Vietnamese back, but the
United States wants a one-year suspension of the forced
repatriation to Vietnam.
   Hurd said the problem will become more accute with the
anticipated arrival of 30,000 to 40,000 more Vietnamese in Hong
Kong this spring and summer.
   He said British efforts were concentrated on explaining to
residents of Vietnam the realities of life in overcrowded camps in
Hong Kong and other Asian nations. Too many Vietnamese are taken in
by smugglers who tell them they are assured of resettlement in the
West, Hurd said.
   Only about 1 percent of those leaving fit Britain's definition
of refugees, or people fleeing persecution. The rest are viewed as
economic migrants seeking a better life.
   Hurd said he had told Baker that the British government is under
pressure to launch an aid program for the Communist government of
Vietnam to improve conditions in the impoverished country. The
United States has imposed economic sanctions on Vietnam, defying
critics who argue that U.S. economic help could do much to stem the
flow of boat people.
   Hurd said the decision announced earlier in the day by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to shut down dozens of military bases at home
and abroad, including pulling out of three Royal Air Force bases in
Britain, was compatible with NATO's objectives. ``We're satisfied
that the decision is reasonable and compatible'' with the Vienna
talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on reducing their
conventional forces in Europe, as well, he said.
   Hurd said he and Baker generally agreed that ``although problems
are clearly accumulating in the Soviet Union, we don't see any
reason to suppose they put a question mark over the leadership'' of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

   President Bush asked Congress on Monday to
close military bases while spending more money on the Strategic
Defense Initiative, establish a new foreign aid program to
encourage democracy in Eastern Europe, and give families with
long-term savings a tax break.
   Here are some of the highlights of the president`s $1.23
trillion spending plan for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   DEFENSE:
   The budget would raise spending from $296.3 billion this year to
$303.3 billion in fiscal 1991 _ a 2.3 percent increase. The Defense
Department said that after inflation of 4.3 percent is figured in,
the change amounts to a 2 percent reduction. The Pentagon would cut
38,000 men and women from the 2 million now in uniform.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney proposed closing or realigning
more than 60 military bases in the United States and 12
installations overseas.
   Two Army divisions would be disbanded by the end of the year.
They are the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 9th
Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Wash.
   The Pentagon would also terminate 20 weapons programs in an
attempt to save $2.9 billion.
   The budget calls, however, for five new B-2 stealth bombers, at
a cost of $5.5 billion, and $900 million for the SDI program, often
dubbed Star Wars. Both proposals, as well as the base closings, are
expected to encounter stiff congressional resistance.
   ``There'll be a debate about defense, there's no question about
that,'' said Speaker of the House Thomas Foley of Washington.
   Also in the defense budget are $1.5 billion for another Trident
submarine and $202 million in continued financing of two land-based
missile systems -the rail-based, multiple-warhead MX and the
truck-based, single-warhead Midgetman. Another $1.7 billion would
be spent for 52 submarine-based Trident II missiles.
   FOREIGN AID:
   Provides $300 million for democracies in Eastern Europe, and
calls for a nearly 80 percent increase to combat drugs, including
$175 million to help drug-producing Andean countries attack the
narcotics problem.
   Proposes to begin the repayment, over a five-year period, of
$620 million in back dues owed to the United Nations, on top of
$794 million in current payments. Another $279 million would be
earmarked for overdue bills from multilateral development banks.
   The two largest recipients of U.S. military and economic aid
would continue at their current levels: $3 billion for Israel and
$2.1 billion for Egypt.
   TAXES:
   Recommends $15.7 billion worth of tax increases but no general
boost in income taxes. There would be a $5.6 billion increase in
user and service fees.
   Also included is a capital-gains tax cut and $1.8 billion in
other tax reductions including a credit of up to $1,000 a year for
each child under age 4 in poor families. Social Security tax
receipts would be used only to pay off government debt, beginning
in 1993.
   The interest paid on family savings accounts held for seven
years would be exempt from income tax up to a limit of $5,000 per
joint tax return or $2,500 per individual return. After the seven
years withdrawals would be tax free. Before that, there would be a
10 percent excise.
   FARM:
   The budget provides $23.4 billion for nutrition, the largest
general program in the Agriculture Department budget, including an
increase of $600 million for food stamps to cover higher food costs
and increased monthly allocations to families. The food stamp
budget would be $15.4 billion.
   There would be less than $5.2 billion for child nutrition,
however, down $156 million from 1990. Despite the decrease,
children from the poorest families would continue to get meals free
and those in middle-level poverty would pay 20 cents a meal instead
of 40 cents as at present.
   Children from affluent families, now entitled to have meals
subsidized by the government, would have to pay full price, adding
about 29 cents per meal to their outlay.
   The budget also provides more money for farm price support
programs. Nevertheless, guaranteed prices for farmers, as well as
the direct payments they receive for major crops, would probably be
reduced if Congress goes along with $1.5 billion in commodity
program cuts being proposed separately.
   The budget could increase farm spending by about 4.1 per cent,
pushing it from the current $48.2 billion to about $50.2 billion.
On the other hand the increase could be held to 1 percent if the
lawmakers approve the unspecified commodity cuts.
   SPACE:
   Increases the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
spending from $12 billion to $14.1 billion, or 24 percent, the
largest increase for any major agency of the government. Calls for
a record 10 space shuttle flights next fiscal year at a cost of
more than $8 billion. The spending blueprint proposes budget
authority of $2.6 billion for development of a manned space station
and $1.2 billion for exploration activities to support a mission to
the moon and, later, to Mars.
   TRANSPORTATION:
   Shifts much of the cost of air traffic control from direct
federal spending to an aviation trust fund financed by user fees.
Currently $3 billion comes from direct spending and $3.4 billion
from the trust fund. Bush would cut the direct federal share to
$1.2 billion and raise the trust fund portion to $6 billion by
increasing the user fees. He said this would pay for 495 more air
traffic controllers and 300 air safety specialists.
   HEAD START:
   Adds $500 million of spending authority for the pre-school
education program, for a total of $1.9 billion. The administration
said the 36 percent increase should allow the program to enroll
180,000 more 4-year-olds from low-income families. About 450,000
children now participate.
   HOUSING:
   Shifts nearly $60 million from low-income rental programs to a
certificate program designed to allow tenants of federally
subsidized housing to buy their units. The $23 billion Housing and
Urban Development budget also provides more money for urban
enterprise zones designed to encourage self-help in the inner
cities.
   DRUGS:
   Boosts over-all federal spending authority for the drug war by
$1.1 billion to $10.6 billion.
   ENVIRONMENT:
   Calls for $4.2 billion to clean up hazardous materials at
Department of Energy nuclear plants and other facilities run by
NASA and the departments of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and
Transportation. This would be an increase $642 million over the
current fiscal year. Requests $175 million for the first year of a
reforestation program aimed at planting 1 billion trees a year on
private land.
   ARTS:
   Increases spending for arts and humanities programs, such as the
national endowments and the National Gallery of Art and Smithsonian
Institution, from $694 million to $757 million. The money includes
$2 million for an exhibit at the national gallery celebrating the
500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage to America.
   WATER PROJECTS:
   No money is provided for new Army Corps of Engineers projects.
The $3.2 billion budget for the agency is about the same as that
for the current year. The corps said the budget reflects ``the new
emphasis placed by the administration on maintaining and restoring
the environment.''

<HEAD>Budget Calls for States to be Innovative in Providing Public
Services</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush's budget message Monday
suggested state and local governments build more toll roads to meet
highway needs and charge air passenger fees to finance new airport
construction.
   A chapter of the fiscal 1991 budget document the administration
sent to Congress highlights efforts by states to come up with ideas
to provide public services in the face of a shrinking federal
ability to provide money.
   It said local governments should encourage car pools, including
use of restricted lanes, and turn to privately run city bus systems
as an alternative to higher-cost public transit systems.
   It recommends broader use of some of those state and local
innovations, and describes others as experiments worth watching in
health care, education, the environment, welfare and child care.
   ``It is a picture of creative experimentation _ not social
engineering, but the natural flowering of variety inherent in a
healthy federal system,'' the budget report says of state and local
efforts. ``It is a picture that merits highlighting _ and federal
government support.''
   The budget said states and local airport authorities are looking
for alternatives to federal funding for expansion or construction,
and that a ``passenger facility charge'' is one prominent
alternative.
   Congress prohibited such fees in 1973, but the administration
will recommend Congress pass legislation abolishing the ban, the
budget said.
   A Transportation Department estimate said that by imposing a fee
of $3 per passenger, nearly 60 major airports would collect more
than twice what they receive in federal airport formula grants.
   Toll roads, while not a new idea, have enjoyed a resurgence in
popularity as federal highway money becomes more scarce. Federal
law has prohibited use of federal money for construction of new
toll roads, but the government allowed several experimental
projects in 1987.
   The administration pointed to northern Virginia, where the state
last year gave permission for investors to build a 14-mile toll
road, the longest private toll road in the country.
   ``For toll road users, transportation costs will be higher, but
travel should be safer and quicker,'' the budget said. ``The
administration will look favorably upon innovative means of
financing highways, including toll roads.''
   Rae Bond, spokeswoman for the National Governors' Association,
said that in highlighting state actions the administration did not
address the governors' call for the federal government to release
some of the more than $16 billion accumulated in the highway trust
fund.
   The governors last summer asked the administration to release
the money, which is accumulating through federal excise taxes and,
the association contends, could be used to pay for transportation
needs in the states.
   ``They appreciate the flexibility to do toll roads if that's
appropriate, and private-sector construction if that's appropriate,
but they have a concern about trying to force states to use toll
roads or private-sector construction,'' Bond said. ``The trust fund
should be used first.''
   The budget said some cities have scaled back plans for rail
rapid transit because of high construction costs and are
substituting improved bus service.
   Private bus service has been successful, sometimes for a portion
of the total transit network, the budget said, adding that federal
studies show private companies can operate 20 percent to 50 percent
less expensively than public agencies, largely because of lower
labor costs.
   It said carpools and use of buses should be encouraged as
alternatives to mass transit, and cited the approach in the
Virginia suburbs of Washington, where designated lanes of a primary
commuter artery _ and an entire highway, during rush hours _ are
reserved for buses or carpools.
   The budget cited a number of state programs aimed at encouraging
poor youths to continue with their education, including young
welfare mothers and fathers.
   Among those it highlighted without endorsing was Wisconsin's
controversial ``Learnfare'' program, which cuts welfare benefits if
the family's children drop out of school.
   It cited an Oregan plan, which will require a federal waiver of
Medicaid rules, to expand health coverage to cover all whose
incomes are below the poverty line.
   While including more people, Oregon would limit cost by assuring
only a ``basic'' package of medical services, with additional
medical services provided only if money is available. The
administration said the plan ``clearly breaks new ground in seeking
to deal with a major problem,'' and it is studying the idea.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday sent Congress a $1.23
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below
inflation and recognizes ``remarkable changes'' in the world by
scaling back defense and rewarding emerging democracies.
   Bush called the spending plan an ``investment in the future.''
But Democratic leaders in Congress pounced on it as a ``standpat
budget'' and challenged its claim to halve the federal deficit, to
$63.1 billion.
   Fights loomed with the Democratic-controlled Congress on a range
of fronts: Bush's desire to cut Medicare and capital gains taxes,
to close military bases he considers outmoded and, on the other
hand, to preserve some expensive weapons.
   Bush would increase spending on space, education, the
environment and the war on drugs. Losers, this year, are Medicare,
college student loans, farm subsidies, energy conservation grants
and mass transit.
   The president's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
calls for $36.5 billion in spending cuts and other
deficit-reduction measures.
   It projects a 7 percent increase in revenues, to $1.17 trillion,
without a general tax increase and just a 3 percent boost in
overall spending - more than a percentage point below the current
rate of inflation.
   Bush proposed defense spending of $292.1 billion, a cut of 2
percent measured against inflation; while boosting foreign aid to
Eastern Europe, the Philippines and Latin America.
   On the domestic front, his budget would leave in place the
Social Security tax increase that took effect earlier this month.
But it honors Bush's 1988 campaign pledge to propose no general tax
increase.
   Still, the budget recommends $15.6 billion in lesser tax
increases and a $5.6 billion increase in user and service fees _
most of them recycled from Reagan budgets and previously defeated
in Congress.
   The budget calls for ``family savings'' accounts under which
families could bank up to $5,000 a year and pay no tax on interest
on deposits held for seven or more years.
   ``With an eye toward future growth, and expansion of the human
frontier, the budget's chief emphasis is on investment in the
future,'' Bush said in a brief message to Congress accompanying the
1,569-page document.
   But Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., called it a document of ``low
aspirations. ... It predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then
goes on to propose no change in course.''
   And House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``I
think it's a standpat budget'' but he said lawmakers would ``take
it very seriously'' rather than pronouncing it ``dead on arrival''
as Democrats had done with several Reagan budgets.
   Bush's budget direction, Richard G. Darman, opened the annual
budget battle by proposing a truce. ``We fully expect to negotiate
with Congress over priorities,'' he told a briefing.
   Bush's budget asserted it was meeting the $64 billion deficit
target for fiscal 1991, under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing
law, ``with specific and defensible measures _ and without
gimmicks.''
   However, critics claimed the administration's prescription for
getting the budget deficit down to $63.1 billion _ from a projected
$123.8 billion this year _ does rely on accounting gimmicks.
   ``They continue to jimmy the figures,'' said Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C. ``It's another fraud.''
   For one thing, Bush's budget uses an optimistic set of economic
projections that assume both declining interest rates and falling
inflation. The budget also calls for overall growth this year of
2.4 percent this year _ compared to the 1.7 percent forecast by
private forecasters and the Congressional Budget Office.
   The government's most recent figures showed economic growth
slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent during the last three
months of 1989.
   ``Obviously, the slowdown in the fourth quarter makes everybody
nervous,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady conceded.
   Bush recycled many proposals which did not reach enactment in
1989 _ a tightening of the Clean Air Act, a reduction in the
capital gains tax rate, a $3,000 tax credit for adoptions, tax
breaks for child care and more money for fighting crime and drugs.
   The most dramatic element of the budget was the scaleback in
defense.
   Propelled by relaxed East-West tensions, the Pentagon budget
calls for a reduction of 38,000 troops and closing dozens of
military bases. It was the most restrained defense budget submitted
by the White House in more than a decade.
   ``Remarkable changes have occurred during the past year. The
Berlin Wall has been opened and democratic forces are on the move
in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said. ``As a result, savings in the
defense budget are now possible.''
   Bush said defense and international policy ``must take advantage
of the opportunities provided'' by these changes.
   However, claiming Soviet military capability ``will remain
formidable, even after announced reductions,'' Bush said he was
proposing a military budget that would allow the nation ``to hedge
against an uncertain future.''
   His plan calls for five costly new B-2 stealth bombers, another
$1 billion Trident submarine and funds for two controversial
intercontinental nuclear missile systems. He also called for an
additional $900 million for the Strategic Defense Initiative, known
as Star Wars.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said defense spending
will be a crucial battleground and predicted Congress would make
``larger reducitons'' that Bush proposed.
   The president's budget calls for a $3 billion increase in
outlays for foreign aid, to $14.2 billion. It calls for $300
million in special assistance ``for those countries in Eastern
Europe that are moving toward democracy'' and another $200 million
for the Philippine government of Corazon Aquino.
   It also requests $270 million in outlays for the Andean
countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to help stem the
international flow of drugs.
   The administration renewed its call for a lower capital gains
tax, proposing that 30 percent of assets held for more than three
years be exempt from the tax. The measure was similar to a proposal
that passed the House but was blocked by filibuster in the Senate
last year that would lower the effective rate of the tax _ on real
estate, stocks and other assets _ to 19.6 percent.
   Currently, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other
income _ 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent.
   The administration did not embrace a proposal by Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to provide a $62 billion cut in Social Security
taxes this year and next. However, it proposed that after 1993 _
when the budget is supposed to be balanced under the Gramm-Rudman
law _ any surpluses in the Social Security trust fund be used to
pay off the national debt.
   As in past budgets, the Social Security surplus masked the size
of the deficit. The 1991 deficit would be $70 billion higher
without this surplus.
   The various domestic cuts totalled $13.9 billion, with $5.5
billion coming from trims in doctor and hospitals payments in the
Medicare health care program.
   Other major program cuts included $1.8 billion in farm price
supports and crop insurance and savings of $2.9 billion by limiting
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining
cost of living increases to civilian and military government
workers. Aid to urban mass transit systems would be cut sharply and
low-income energy assistance would be trimmed by $340 million, to
less than $1.1 billion.

   Former Communists on Monday elected a
35-year-old sports official to lead a new party in its quest for
popularity in the East bloc's first democracy.
   But one day after its founding, the new Social Democracy of the
Republic of Poland was accused of ``political arrogance'' by
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa for taking over the holdings amassed
by the Communists during their rule.
   It also contended with a breakaway group of reformers, whose
were organizing a rival Social-Democratic Union that would have
nothing to do with the old party's leadership or assets.
   Parliamentarians for the Communist Party, which was officially
disbanded early Monday, reflected the confusion among the remnants
of their party.
   Twenty Communist deputies lined up behind the Social Democracy
Party, 25 joined the Social-Democratic Union, and the remaining 125
members _ including caucus leader Marian Orzechowski _ withheld
support from either side, state TV reported.
   In lopsided votes, Aleksander Kwasniewski became the Social
Democracy Party's chairman and Leszek Miller, a 43-year-old former
Communist Party secretary, its general secretary.
   Kwasniewski, who has close ties to the former Communist
leadership, will lead the new party's Supreme Council, while Miller
will be the administrator overseeing party bureaucracy.
   Kwasniewski received 1,049 votes for chairman and Miller 926
votes for general secretary out of about 1,200 votes cast.
   The two men immediately were embraced and congratulated by
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, the first secretary of the dissolved
Communist Party.
   ``We feel very moved by this election, and also terrified,
because we are aware of the immense tasks,'' Kwasniewski told the
delegates.
   Kwasniewski, who leads the state sports and youth committee,
said he wanted a party capable of rallying leftist opinions and
winning popular backing after the demise of the Communist Party.
   TV reported that red flags were removed from party buildings
nationwide.
   ``The most important thing is votes, not members. The better
party is one with 100,000 members and (capable of getting) 1
million votes, than a party with 1 million members and only 100,000
votes,'' he said.
   He said the latter case described the old Communist Party, which
was in disarray after ceding power to a Solidarity-led government
in August.
   His party, in a resolution adopted Monday, called for ``further
strengthening of ties'' with the emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe.
   In Gdansk, Walesa criticized the party for taking over the
Communist holdings, which he said belong to the ``whole society.''
   Taking the property would be ``an act of political arrogance,''
Walesa said. ``In the conditions of revised political pluralism,
none of the parties can start from a privileged position.''
   There has been a public clamor for the state to confiscate the
property acquired by the Communists, and Walesa said he hoped a
special government commission reviewing the issue would ``not
disappoint social expectations.''
   The breakaway Social-Democratic Union formed under reformer
Tadeusz Fiszbach, a onetime Gdansk party chief who is close to
Walesa, rejected any remnants of the old party.
   Fiszbach proclaimed the separate party on Sunday and continued
to sign up followers Monday _ meeting in the same sprawling
building where the Social Democracy Party was in congress.
   ``In our opinion, what the (Social Democracy Party) congress was
incapable of doing was saying `We are sorry' to the society for all
the abuses'' of the Communist years, said Marek Krol, a newspaper
editor who joined Fiszbach's party. ``This is one of the basic
differences.''
   Fiszbach said his party intends to participate in local
elections in April.
   The old Communist Party claimed to have 1.9 million members,
only a portion of which were expected to join either the Social
Democracy Party or the Social-Democratic Union.

   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ Todor Zhivkov, whose word was law in Bulgaria
for 35 years, has been moved from house arrest to a prison for
people accused of murder and other major crimes, the chief
prosecutor's office said Monday.
   A statement carried by the official news agency BTA said
Zhivkov, ousted as Communist Party chief Nov. 10, was being
questioned.
   The 78-year-old former leader already has been charged with
misappropriating state property, inciting ethnic hostility and
abuse of power.
   Misuse of state property, the most serious charge, carries a
maximum penalty of 30 years. The ethnic hostility count arose from
discriminatory policies against the ethnic Turkish minority in
Bulgaria.
   Zhivkov is one of two former Eastern European leaders charged
with crimes.
   In East Berlin, the chief East German prosecutor said Erich
Honecker was arrested and imprisoned after leaving a hospital
Monday and will be tried for treason in March. Honecker, 77, had
been recovering from surgery to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   Authorities detained Zhivkov on Jan. 19 and placed him in
investigative custody. News reports said he was kept in a villa
adapted for the purpose.
   Monday's statement from the prosecutor did not say when Zhivkov
was moved to the Remand Prison of the Criminal Investigation
Department, which houses people suspected of, or charged with,
serious crimes.
   Several relatives and close associates of Zhivkov also have been
accused of crimes. The prosecutor's statement announced indictments
of his son-in-law, Ivan Slavkov, and an investigation of Milko
Balev, a former Zhivkov aide.
   Slavkov, president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee and a
member of the International Olympic Committee, was charged with
illegal posession of ``a large quantity of firearms ... receiving
considerable remunerations on questionable legal grounds, and with
malfeasance in office,'' it said.
   Balev, a former Politburo member, faces charges of ``malfeasance
in office and misappropriation of public property,'' the statement
said. It did not say whether the two were in custody.
   Negotiations began Monday between the Communist Party and
opposition.
   The foreign debt of about $11 billion and growing economic
problems were the main items of discussion by party delegates and
the Union of Democratic Forces, a loose alliance of 12 independent
groups and parties.
   Union spokesman Georgi Spassov said Sunday the opposition would
not join any coalition government before elections, scheduled for
May, because it does not want to be a scapegoat for past economic
failures or have reforms blocked by the Communist-controlled
parliament.
   But Zhelyu Zhelev, chairman of the opposition delegation,
appeared to modify this view Monday when he said, ``We are no
demagogues; we can change our opinion.'' However, leaders of some
groups within the alliance virtually ruled out any cooperation with
the Communists.
   ``One must not strike compromises with compromised
personalities,'' said Rumen Vodenicharov, who leads the Independent
Committee for Human Rights.
   The Communist Party convenes a congress Tuesday at which
reformers are expected to try to break with policies associated
with Zhivkov's tenure. Old guard Communists likely will try to slow
reform moves, fearing the collapse of the party and the loss of
their privileges.
   Spassov predicted conservatives would force out reformers if
they tried to go too far.
   Other opposition leaders were less pessimistic.
   ``The old guard will mount a strong challenge, but I do not
think it will be strong enough to topple the reformers,'' said
Deyan Kyuranov, a senior member of the Ecoglasnost enviromentalist
organization.

   Three Lockheed engineers detained in the
North African country of Chad for 20 days have returned home to
Georgia, the company said.
   Lockheed officials said the three employees arrived by private
plane Saturday and were met by relatives.
   ``As far as Lockheed is concerned, the book is closed and we
will have no further comment on the situation,'' spokesman Dick
Martin said in a statement Monday from Lockheed's Marietta plant.
   The three engineers _ Irving Thrash, Marvin Gambill and Ernest
Ruse _ were held at police barracks in N'Djamena from Jan. 5-15 for
destroying a technical manual for two C-130 aircraft the Chad
government purchased from Lockheed. The men said they were not
licensed to export the manual.
   Lockheed arranged with the State Department for an export
license and brought a new copy of the manual to give to Chad
authorities.
   The men were confined at a hotel until they left the country
Thursday.

   Leading Soviet immigration activists on Monday
called for emergency evacuation of Soviet Jews, who they said are
endangered by anti-Semitism and possible pogroms.
   ``Our Soviet Jewish brethren are in danger,'' the activists said
in a statement. ``The government, the army and the police are
unable to restore order. The realities of civil war threaten all
citizens of the Soviet Union, especially the Jews.
   ``Unbounded anti-Semitic propaganda, the strenghtening of
anti-Semitic groups, murders and the threat of pogrom have become
the norm of life for Soviet Jewry,'' they said.
   The group, which included former Soviet ``refuseniks'' Ida
Nudel, Yosef Begun, Vladimir Slepak and Yosef Mendelevitch, called
on the Soviet Union to fulfill its promise to allow direct flights
from Moscow to Israel.
   The Soviets, facing strong protests from the Arab world over the
influx to Israel, have refused to approve the direct flights
agreement between Aeroflot and Israel's El Al airlines.
   On Monday, the Kremlin summoned Israel's ambassador to Moscow
and condemned the settlement of some of the Soviet emigres in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Alexander Zinchuk, the Soviet ambassador to Jordan, was quoted
in an interview with the English-language Jordan Times as saying
that the Kremlin was talking to the PLO about the issue, but there
was little Moscow could do to stop the flow.
   ``We are in a difficult position over this (immigration)
issue,'' he said, blaming the United States for putting quotas on
the number of Soviet refugees that it would accept.
   Last year, 12,000 Soviet Jews came to Israel, and the government
expects up to 100,000 to arrive in the next year.
   Begun, who had waged a 17-year battle for emigration before
coming to Israel in 1988, called for Western pressure on Moscow to
implement the agreement.
   In addition, the group called for an increase in the existing
flights through Romania and Hungary and the opening of all other
means of transportation such as ships, buses and railroads.
   As one example of the dangers faced by the Jews, the activists
cited a Soviet TV report broadcast on Saturday that said members of
the Russian nationalist group Pamyat, at a recent rally in Moscow,
openly called for a Jewish pogrom May 5.
   ``What else do we need?'' asked Vladimir Lifshitz, a member of
the activist group.
   The activists blamed Israel's government for failing to
understand the urgency and for the delays in issuing emigration
invitations, which are needed to start emigration procedures. They
said some Soviet Jews had to wait for five to eight months for an
invitation from Israel.
   ``I accuse my government of not being willing to understand the
seriousness of today's situation in Russia,'' Ms. Nudel said. ``If
it will permit a new tragedy to happen, all the blame will be fully
upon us.''

   Federal and state wildlife officers
investigating a report of dead birds in an oil pit found the
remains of a bald eagle, a great blue heron and a duck, an agent
said Monday.
   Since Oct. 1, the federal government has had the authority to
prosecute the owners of uncovered oil tanks and oil pits in the
deaths of migratory birds.
   Kash Schriefer, an agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Services, said the eagle was found last week in the pit in a rural
area east of Duncan in southwestern Oklahoma.
   The bird will be tested to determine if the oiling was the cause
of death, Schriefer said. He said the department plans to prosecute
the owner of the pit if charges are warranted.
   The birds are protected by the migratory bird act, and the eagle
is also protected by the eagle protection law and as an endangered
species.

   Mobil Oil Corp. was fined $4,500 on Monday
and placed on two years' probation for two pipeline ruptures that
poured more than 130,000 gallons of crude oil into the Los Angeles
River and city sewers.
   The fine imposed by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada
was the maximum permitted for two misdemeanor charges, to which
Mobil pleaded no contest in December.
   A restitution hearing was scheduled March 6.
   The first pipeline break occurred Sept. 10, 1988, in the
suburban Encino area and sent 90,000 gallons of crude oil onto city
streets. The oil eventually flowed into sewers and the Los Angeles
River.
   The second break occurred 17 days later as the pipeline was
being repaired.
   The line carries 2.6 million gallons of oil daily from Kern
County oil fields to Mobil's Torrance refinery.
   Temperature changes in the oil caused the pipeline to corrode
and rupture the first time, said Deputy City Attorney Vincent B.
Sato, adding there was no indication of negligence.
   Mobil attorney Ernest J. Getto said at the time of the no
contest pleas that the company had revised its monitoring
procedures and had begun replacing older sections of the pipeline.
   City Attorney James Hahn wants Mobil to pay for the cleanup.
   Only two restitution claims were filed by Monday _ a Fire
Department bill for more than $200,000 and a $17,000 state
Department of Fish and Game bill.
   The police, city Department of Animal Control and county Flood
Control District have yet to complete claims, said Mike Qualls, a
spokesman for the City Attorney's Office.

   ``I'm in a grumpy mood today,'' President Bush
groused Monday, complaining he had eaten too much Texas barbecue at
a Superbowl party.
   ``No answers today. I'm trying to think of answers and (I'm
getting) too many questions,'' he said as reporters asked him about
the $1.23 trillion budget plan he unveiled for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush talked about his bad mood during a picture-taking ceremony
in the Oval Office with visiting British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd.
   Brushing off the press as he normally does at photo
opportunities, Bush said, ``I ate too much yesterday and I just
don't feel like answering any questions. And besides that, it
violates the groundrules to answer any questions.''
   He allowed as how he sometimes does answer, but ``only when we
want to answer questions.''
   Bush and his wife Barbara had about a dozen people in Sunday to
watch the Superbowl, and served barbecue from Ft. Worth.
   While saying he had overindulged, Bush quickly added, ``I don't
want to get any rumors started about my physical condition.
   ``I'm just grumpy. I don't want to talk about it.
   ``It was good,'' he concluded, talking about the food.

<HEAD>Bush's Budget Seeks $14 Billion _ at Least _ in Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1991 budget President Bush released Monday
relies on spending cuts in defense and domestic programs for at
least $14.2 billion in deficit reduction, but the precise total
depends on who is doing the calculations.
   By all accounts, however, the president's $1.23 trillion budget
was relying on spending cuts for less than half the $36.5 billion
in savings it sought in its quest to slice the federal deficit to
$63.1 billion.
   The president's own budget documents claim to reduce spending
next year on programs ranging from Medicare to military pay by a
total of $16.9 billion below the rate at which they would otherwise
grow.
   But an analysis by Senate Budget Committee Republicans put the
total at $14.2 billion. The Democratic staff of the House Budget
Committee decided that all told, Bush has proposed $16.1 billion in
spending reductions.
   At any rate, those totals are net spending cuts. In fact, Bush
proposed many billions more in reductions _ the number was not
available Monday _ that are offset by spending increases he wants
in other areas.
   It's all part of the confusion that results every year the day
the president's spending plan is unveiled as budget technicians
pore through the thick document, often not finding the figures they
hoped to locate.
   Everyone agreed that the biggest chunk of the savings _ $5.5
billion _ would come from the Medicare program that helps the poor
and handicapped pay their medical bills.
   Of the total, $3.35 billion of the cuts would come from
reimbursements made to hospitals, while payments to doctors and for
other outpatient services would be reduced by $2.15 billion.
   Such proposals have had a hard time making it through Congress
in the past.
   Another $3.6 billion in savings would be earned by reducing
various health and retirement benefits for federal employees. That
would include a freeze on annual cost-of-living increases for
government civilian and military retirees and a separate proposal
to have the Postal Service _ which is off-budget _ pay health
benefits for retirees.
   Bush's call for a $303.3 billion defense budget _ including some
nuclear weapons work by the Department of Energy _ shrinks the
military budget by 2 percent below the rate of inflation. As the
budget is calculated, this counts for $3.2 billion in savings.
   Subsidies to farmers paid by the Commodity Credit Corp. would be
reduced by $1.5 billion.
   Other spending cuts the budget lists include nearly $500 million
by reducing payments for school lunch programs and for meals
provided by day-care centers; $100 million by limiting the
government's costs of administering its foster care efforts; and
$157 million by limiting the ability of distant relatives to
inherit a deceased veteran's benefits.
   The balance of Bush's proposed savings come from minor tax
increases, new fees for federal services and sales of federal
assets.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP)_ The Internal Revenue Service's $6.1 billion
budget request for next year would enable the tax-collecting agency
to start auditing more income tax returns.
   The IRS expects to audit only 97 of every 10,000 tax returns for
1989, an all-time low.
   Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told reporters that with
improvements expected under the fiscal 1991 spending plan that
President Bush sent Congress on Monday, that number should rise to
102 per 10,000 for 1990 returns and 103 per 10,000 for 1991 returns.
   Those figures do not include IRS computer checks of the returns
of the 40 million taxpayers who file returns based principally on
income from wages, interest and dividends, Goldberg said.
   IRS computers automatically check those returns to make sure
they include all income reported by employers, banks and brokers.
While those computer checks are not audits, Goldberg said, they are
very thorough.
   ``The fact remains that there has been a continuing decline in
audit coverage for a number of years, but now we are seeing a
reversal of the trend,'' he said.
   The proposed IRS budget increase to $6.1 billion next year
represents an 11.6 percent increase in its current spending of $5.5
billion.
   Goldberg also said the IRS expects to spend as much as $6
billion to replace its obsolete computer system over the next
decade. He said this will give agency employees faster access to
taxpayer data, so that taxpayers can get immediate telephone
answers to questions about their accounts.

<TEXT>
   A Senate bill was introduced Monday that would
require telephone companies to allow customers to block Caller
I.D., a new service that displays a caller's phone number before
the receiver is picked up.
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said he was in favor of the new
technology, but that customers also should have the option of not
giving out their phone numbers.
   ``A privacy balance must be struck,'' Kohl said in introducing
the Telephone Privacy Act of 1990.
   ``Who decides whether the caller will reveal his or her
number?'' Kohl said. ``I think the decision must rest with the
caller.''
   Caller I.D., which has been available in New Jersey for more
than a year and is just beginning to be offered in Tennessee, West
Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland, uses a small
terminal that displays the numbers of incoming calls. The device
costs $50 or more to purchase, and the Caller I.D. service costs
about $7 a month.
   Privacy rights advocates claim it is an Orwellian intrusion on
individual privacy unless a blocking option is offered. Phone
companies such as Bell Atlantic, which is phasing in Caller I.D. in
the mid-Atlantic states but not offering blocking, say a blocking
provision would defeat the purpose of the service.
   California has passed legislation requiring blocking be offered
with Caller I.D., and Pennsylvania allows police and domestic
violence agencies to block it. Some phone companies have said
privacy concerns have delayed their plans to introduce the service.
   Kohl sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which, according to
congressional sources, will consider Caller I.D. as part of
hearings on a number of privacy issues this year.
   Kohl said he planned to sign up for the service whenever it is
offered in his home district of Milwaukee or in Washington.
   ``But there is a down side,'' he said. ``Caller I.D. will
diminish our privacy as callers.''
   ``People with unlisted phone numbers are forced to divulge their
numbers every time they contact someone who has Caller I.D.,'' he
said, noting that a woman in a battered women's shelter may not
want to reveal her number while calling her family.
   Under Kohl's bill, calls to 911 emergency lines would not be
blocked. His bill does not specify, however, whether blocking
should be offered on a per-call or a subscription basis, or whether
it should be free.
   David Barasch, consumer advocate of Pennsylvania, said he
supported Kohl's bill and endorsed it on behalf of the National
Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, Kohl's office said.
   President Bush's special adviser for consumer affairs, Bonnie
Guiton, also backed the idea of blocking, she said in a statement.

<HEAD>Battle Over Peace Dividend Anything But Peaceful</HEAD>

   The battle between Congress and the Bush
administration over how to divvy up the ``peace dividend'' could
make the Cold War look like a Sunday school picnic.
   The sniping began in earnest Monday with delivery of President
Bush's 1991 budget request to Congress and will likely continue for
several years as U.S. policy makers try to adjust to a new world
symbolized by the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   The central questions revolve around the magnitude of defense
savings made possible from lessened East-West tensions _ and which
programs will receive additional funds as a result.
   At present, there is nothing approaching a consensus on the
answers to either of those questions.
   The apectations about the peace dividend in the
first place.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney announced last November that he
was searching for Pentagon cuts totaling $180 billion over the next
six years. However, Cheney was calculating his savings against an
administration plan projecting a buildup in defense forces that
Congress had already rejected.
   Thus, the actual savings will be far less.
   No one disputes that there will savings, but the scale of the
windfall will be much more modest, especially in the next few years.
   In 1991, for example, the administration's new budget puts the
``peace dividend'' at $3.2 billion. That figure is arrived at by
comparing what the administration is seeking in total military
outlays, $303.3 billion, compared to the $306.4 billion that would
be required to let the Pentagon keep pace with inflation.
   The $3.2 billion figure left Democrats definitely unimpressed,
with many accusing Darman of playing his own political game by
proposing steep cuts in military personnel, coupled with a whole
new round of base closings, while protecting the administration's
pet multibillion-dollar weapons programs.
   Democratic leaders left no doubt that they would be looking for
deeper cuts in some of the weapons programs favored by Bush.
   ``There will be a debate about defense, no question about
that,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   But after all the arguing over how much money can be wrung out
of the Pentagon, a new battle will commence over where the extra
funds should be spent.
   A whole array of advocates for domestic programs have begun
lining up, seeking extra money for everything from cleaning up the
environment to taking care of the disadvantaged and rebuilding
America's crumbling road and bridge system.
   Social advocates sense a golden opportunity after having to
endure a long dry spell of austere budgets in the Reagan era of
large Pentagon buildups.
   Takes together, the proposals for increased domestic spending
exceed $200 billion a year, far dwarfing any windfall from defense.
   But there is another worry. With everyone looking for the
newfound pot of gold, what will that do to the discipline needed to
reach a consensus for cutting the federal budget deficit.
   ``We have to keep reminding people that even if we get new money
(from a peace dividend), we still have a budget deficit, which
means we still have to find places to cut spending,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. and senior Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee.

   President Bush will travel to Raleigh, N.C.,
and Knoxville, Tenn., on Friday to visit research laboratories at
two major state universities, the White House announced Monday.
   Bush will visit North Carolina State University to tour
electrical engineering laboratories and hold a roundtable
discussion with research scientists and graduate students.
   He then will fly on to Knoxville to visit the campus of the
University of Tennessee for a demonstration and group discussion on
microbiological ways to clean up environmental damage. Bush will
deliver an address afterwards to the University of Tennessee
community.
   The White House press office said further details of the trip

<HEAD>Police: Boy Killed for Ransom from Drug-Dealing Brother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidnapped 12-year-old boy whose finger was cut
off to persuade his drug-dealing brother to pay ransom was found
dead in a pile of plastic bags just days after the brother was
killed, police said Monday.
   A man collecting cans on a bike path Sunday discovered the body
of William Porter, who was abducted Dec. 5 as he walked to school.
   The boy's 25-year-old brother, Richard Thomas Porter, had
refused to cooperate with the police investigation of the
kidnapping. Detectives speculated he may have been negotiating his
brother's release before he turned up fatally shot Jan. 4, not far
from where William was found in the New York borough of the Bronx.
   A police spokesman, Lt. Raymond O'Donnell, said William's body
was identified Monday by family members. An autopsy report on the
cause of death was not complete, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for
the city medical examiner, said Monday.
   Detectives believe the boy was kidnapped for up to $500,000 in
ransom from Richard Porter, reputed by police to be a mid-level
drug distributor who controlled several street dealers in Harlem.
   A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
William's right index finger was severed and left Dec. 6 with a
short taped message from him in the bathroom of a Manhattan
restaurant.
   ``They cutted my finger off,'' the sixth-grader cried on the
tape, the Daily News said in Jan. 5 editions. ``Please help. ... I
love you mommy.''
   Richard Porter was found shot in the head and chest. His wallet,
with more than $2,000 in it, was found on his body. At the time his
slaying, police refused to comment on the kidnapping because the
12-year-old had not been found.
   The kidnappers demanded ransom money in a series of telephone
calls, notes and the taped message from William, all on Dec. 5 and
6.
   The kidnappers had told Richard Porter in a telephone call to go
to the restaurant bathroom, but he sent another family member
instead.
   The last contact with the kidnappers came Dec. 10, when a woman
handed a note to a child in Manhattan and told him to deliver it to
William's aunt, who lived in the area.
   The note said the boy was in pain and needed medical attention.

   A 7-year-old boy identified photographs of
a man and the man's bicycle as those of the person who raped and
sexually mutilated him and left him for dead, a prosecutor said
Monday in his opening statement.
   ``His eyes got very wide ... he was sure,'' Pierce County deputy
prosecutor James Roche said of the boy's identification of Earl
Kenneth Shriner. ``He was sure that was the man who had attacked
him.''
   Shriner, 40, who has a history of sexual attacks, is charged
with first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and two
counts of first-degree rape.
   The savageness of this case, in which the boy's penis was cut
off, has sparked major proposals in the current Legislature for
dealing with predatory sex offenders. Proposals range from civil
commitment to castration.
   Immediately after the attack, the boy was incoherent and afraid
he'd done something bad, Roche told the jury.
   But the child, who has turned 8 since the May 20 attack,
recovered and identified his attacker. He is scheduled to testify.
   The jury was selected last week in Bellingham, 120 miles north
of Tacoma, because of extensive pre-trial news coverage. Jurors are
being sequestered in Tacoma during the trial.
   Roche said testimony from the boy, as well as microscopic
analysis of hair and blood recovered from Shriner's clothing and
other personal effects, would tie Shriner to the crime.
   But Dino Sepe, one of Shriner's defense lawyers, said Shriner
``is the wrong man, and the evidence is going to show that man is
the wrong man.''
   Immediately after the attack the boy ``pretty much rambled
incoherently ... at one point he said, `I've been bad,''' the
prosecutor said.
   But by the next day, the boy was able to identify Shriner from a
photo montage that included the pictures of five other men, Roche
said. The boy also identified a picture of the bicycle Shriner
allegedly used to lure him into woods near the child's home.
   Blood taken from Shriner's jacket matched the boy's blood type,
and 15 hairs found on a yellow braided cord recovered from the
pocket of Shriner's jacket also match, Roche said.
   Seven of those 15 hairs showed root damage ``as if they had been
pulled out of the head,'' said the prosecutor.
   Sepe cautioned jurors that they had to find ``evidence for every
element of every crime beyond a reasonable doubt'' to convict
Shriner.
   Shriner willingly let police in his house when they arrived at
his door on the morning of May 21, Sepe said.
   ``He told them he had nothing to hide. He knew he had nothing to
hide. He fully cooperated with the officers,'' Sepe said. ``He told
them he had no contact with any children that night.''
   Sepe said the blood and hair samples were not conclusive.
``There's millions of people (with) that similar type of blood,''
he said.

   President Bush's budget promises to save your
family $114,000 in taxes over the next 25 years if you can set
aside $5,000 a year. It makes enticing promises, too, if you love
trees, have a houseful of tots or are fascinated by magnetic
levitation.
   But in budgetry, an exercise somewhat removed from reality, the
budget that giveth also taketh away.
   The taking would come from people who ride Amtrak or the
airlines, go boating on weekends or work for the federal government.
   Don't bank on the $114,000 windfall or get rid of your boat. By
August, when Congress usually focuses on budgets, January's
proposals have a habit of changing or vanishing altogether.
   Bush's proposal to require a $25 decal on any recreational or
commercial boat using waterways patrolled by the Coast Guard
revived an idea originally floated by President Reagan. Congress
balked, and the idea sank.
   So, too, did Reagan's proposal to drop the federal subsidy
received by the Amtrak rail passenger system. Reagan said it would
be cheaper to hand an airline or bus ticket to every Amtrak
passenger than to pay a subsidy averaging $30 for every Amtrak
rider.
   Bush's fiscal 1991 budget plan drops that argument, but retains
the proposal. His budget director, Richard Darman, told reporters
Monday that ``the federal government's responsibility is not to run
the railroads.''
   Magnetic levitation is something else again. The budget document
describes it as ``a new transportation technology that relies on
the use of magnets for propulsion and levitation rather than
conventional steel-wheel-on-rail technology.'' Bush proposed
spending $9.7 million to check it out.
   In the meantime, Bush proposed eliminating subsidies to keep
big-city mass transit systems operating. Darman said that's a local
responsibility.
   Air passengers would pay more _ a boost in the 8 percent ticket
tax to 10 percent _ but would get more, for airport construction
and hiring 495 more air traffic controllers to help the 17,000 now
scanning the skies.
   The $3 tax on international flights would double.
   Here's how that $114,000 windfall would work for families able
to save:
   Families with incomes under $120,000 would be able to open two
savings accounts in which husband and wife would deposit a total of
$5,000. If the accounts were left untouched for more than seven
years, the interest earned would escape taxation. Early withdrawal,
in less than three years, would carry a 10 percent penalty on top
of the regular tax on interest.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady figures that in 25 years a
family would save $395,000 of which $114,000 would otherwise have
been paid in taxes. He assumed the family pays income tax at a 28
percent rate and can find a bank paying 8 percent interest.
   Poor families would get a tax credit of $1,000 _ subtracted from
taxes owed _ for every youngster under age 4. And parents who adopt
children with special needs could deduct $3,000. To start those
tots on the road to school, Bush proposed making room for 180,000
more Head Start youngsters in a program that now enrolls 450,000
needy preschoolers.
   For investors who hold onto their stocks for three years or
more, 30 percent of the profits when they finally sell the stocks
would be tax-exempt. That's more generous than the capital gains
tax proposal that, with Bush's backing, passed the House but
stalled in the Senate last year.
   Federal workers would be among the losers in the budgetary game
of winners and losers. Bush's budget proposes a three-month delay
in a federal pay raise that is scheduled to take effect Oct. 31.
And the 30 percent of state and local government workers who are
exempt from Social Security taxes _ and benefits _ would lose that
status.
   What the president proposed for trees was to plant more of them
_ one billion a year through a $175 million reforestation program
plus another 30 million through a community ``plant a tree''
initiative.
   His budget message said growing more trees across America would
fight the threat of climatic warming known as the greenhouse
effect. An acre of trees removes up to 9 million tons of carbon
dioxide from the air, but the country is losing 700,000 acres of
trees annually, it said.
   Finally, grim prospects for tax sharpies. The budget proposes
more money for enforcement of the tax laws, specifically for
collecting delinquent taxes, checking out fake dependent claims,
auditing mortgage interest deductions, and matching what the
taxpayer says he received in interest against what interest payers
say they paid.
   Those steps, said the budget, should ``close the gap between
taxes owed and taxes paid.''

   Many Azerbaijanis heeded their leaders' call to
``put our grief aside'' and return to work in their capital Monday,
but the defense minister said Soviet troops could not be withdrawn
yet from the Caucasus.
   ``The situation is not the best,'' Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov told the government daily Izvestia about the ethnic turmoil
in the southern Soviet Union.
   He cited attempts by extremists to keep workers from their jobs
in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital on the Caspian Sea, weapons still
held by those insurgents and their attacks on government buildings.
Yazov did not provide details.
   Asked by Izvestia when Soviet troops, who stormed the oil center
of Baku more than a week ago, would be pulled out, Yazov responded:
``Troops will remain until the required order is restored.''
   Azerbaijan's top politicians and political activists have been
demanding for days that the troops be withdrawn, saying they are
not needed to keep order and are infringing on the republic's
sovereignty.
   The official news agency Tass said most of Baku's businesses
resumed work Monday and mass transit was operating on most routes.
   Baku Radio broadcast an appeal by the republic's Communist Party
and government leaders for citizens to return to work.
   ``We have to put our grief aside for the sake of all those who
continue to live and for the sake of the welfare of the children,
the women, the elderly and each and every family,'' said the
appeal, monitored by the BBC in London.
   ``We call on you to report to work to give a new life to each
and every house, town, district and city,'' it said.
   Tass said leaflets circulated in the city urged the strikes to
continue, and Izvestia reported that extremists went to apartments
and threatened to attack people if they went to work.
   Soviet media reported more arrests of nationalist leaders in
Azerbaijan's capital.
   ``The extremist strongholds with stocks of food and ammunition
are being detected,'' Radio Moscow said Monday.
   A Moscow spokesman for the Azerbaijani People's Front, a group
that has organized anti-Armenian protests, reported that as of
Monday, more than 200 members had been arrested in Baku.
   One of those arrested blamed militant People's Front leaders for
the bloodshed, saying they had ignored official warnings to halt
attempts to seize power and prevent Soviet troops from entering
Baku. Heibulla Balash Agayev made the remarks on Azerbaijani
television Sunday and Tass reported them Monday.
   Yazov has said troops moved into Baku to destroy the People's
Front and other smaller groups that were about to seize power.
   Soviet TV showed empty seats in Baku classrooms and said many
students and teachers were staying away from school because they
feared attack.
   In another development, the mainly Christian Armenians and
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis on Sunday began pulling back from
the border between Armenia and Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani
territory bounded by Armenia, Iran and Turkey. Tass said there were
no new ethnic clashes in Nakhichevan.
   The withdrawals went without incident Sunday, according to Yusif
Samedugli, a leader of the nationalist Azerbaijani People's Front,
and Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan.
   Last week, activists agreed to a truce at that border, one of
the most bitterly contested areas.
   Armenians are demanding control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave
of Azerbaijan populated largely by Armenians. The two Soviet
republics have feuded intermittently over Nagorno-Karabakh for two
years.
   The conflict exploded into anti-Armenian riots on Jan. 13 in
Baku and led to battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the
countryside. Soviet troops stormed Baku on Jan. 20.
   At least 197 people have been killed in the neighboring
republics since Jan. 13, by official count, with 125 of the deaths
following the arrival of Soviet troops.
   Signs in Baku blame President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the
deaths, labeling him a killer with blood on his hands, the British
television company ITN reported from Baku.
   Peace talks between representatives of the Armenian National
Movement and the Azerbaijani People's Front are scheduled for
Thursday in Riga, Latvia.
   Both sides say they will discuss troop withdrawals, refugees and
other humanitarian concerns. Some reports said the territorial
dispute will not be on the agenda.
   ``The goal is to stop senseless bloodletting,'' said Dainis
Ivans, a Latvian People's Front leader and one of three mediators.
   The Baltic nationalist movements' initiative to sponsor the
talks between Armenians and Azerbaijanis reflected how much clout
the burgeoning movements have gained in the past year and their
concern over Kremlin intervention.
   Another Latvian People's Front mediator, Romas Razukas, said the
Baltic groups have experience in achieving change peacefully and
this could be a lesson to Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   ``We would like to persuade them of the value of diplomacy and
the use of parliamentary means to resolve disputes. We want them to
understand how much we have achieved through those means,'' Razukas
said.
   Tass reported Monday that three leaders of the Azerbaijan
People's Front, the most powerful nationalist group in the
republic, had been detained by the KGB. The news agency also said
about 10,000 leaflets calling for civil disobedience were seized at
a Baku factory.
   In the Armenian capital of Yerevan, a sniper exchanged gunfire
with Soviet soldiers trying to recapture armored vehicles and other
military equipment seized by extremists, Tass said. One man was
killed and several wounded.
   In another attack, militants armed with submachine guns broke
into police headquarters in Yerevan on Monday and took 135 pistols,
Tass said.

   President Bush asked Congress on Monday for
$300 million in fiscal 1991 to reward emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe and proposed major aid increases to Andean countries
to help stem drug production.
   But the president's overall $18.2 billion foreign affairs budget
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 was largely devoid of
details, including specific requests for most U.S. aid recipients
around the world and a description of exactly what Bush wants to do
in Eastern Europe.
   Also missing from the budget is any mention of Panama.
   The administration will seek a special appropriation this year
to send about $500 million in cash and a like amount in non-cash
benefits to help the Panamanian economy recover from U.S. sanctions
and invasion.
   However, the administration apparently has not decided what it
wants to do for Panama in fiscal 1991.
   The $300 million for countries behind the crumbling Iron Curtain
was billed as ``a special assistance initiative,'' but appeared to
some to be primarily the second installment of a three-year aid
package Congress approved last year for Poland and Hungary.
   A Senate Budget Committee Analysis called the proposal a cut
from last year.
   ``I don't see much for Eastern Europe, to be frank,'' said House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., was poised to introduce his own package of aid to the
Eastern European countries Tuesday, including easing trade
restrictions and some direct aid.
   It appeared likely that last year's criticisms of Bush as too
timid toward Eastern Europe were likely to be replayed.
   The budget document promised that legislation will be sent to
Capitol Hill spelling out more clearly how the money would be used
to encourage free-market economic reform and development of
democracy.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is still struggling
with aid allocations for the current year, is likely to be
questioned about the administration's intentions when he testifies
Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Acknowledging that the ``bipolar superpower era'' is over, the
budget puts a new emphasis on international organizations that
contrasts with the skepticism showed such groups by Bush's
predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Bush's budget promises to pay off past-due debts to the United
Nations and multilateral development banks left by Reagan _ $620
million in back dues to the U.N. plus $794 million for the
regularly scheduled payment, and $279 million to clear a backlog
for the banks.
   A nearly 80 percent boost is proposed in aid for the war on
drugs, including $175 million in what the budget terms new aid
``for the economies of those countries that evidence a
determination to attack seriously the narcotics problem.''
   Under pressure from Capitol Hill, the administration apparently
is seeking some of that aid to help coca farmers switch to other
crops. Coca is used to produce cocaine.
   In addition, law enforcement aid of $20 million is sought for
Colombia, where a crackdown on cocaine cartels has brought violent
retaliation; $19 million for Peru, the world's largest coca leaf
producer; and $15.7 million for Bolivia.
   The estimated outlays for all international affairs categories _
foreign aid, maintaining embassies and running the State Department
_ would be $18.2 billion in 1991, an effective increase of nearly
12 percent.
   The 1990 figure is estimated at $14.6 billion, but has been
artificially reduced by one-time income of $1.7 billion from early
repayment of past military aid loans.
   The budget proposal would continue the two largest recipients of
U.S. military and economic aid at their current levels: $3 billion
for Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt.
   It asks, as well, for $200 million to pay the second installment
of a five-year, $1 billion pledge to an international aid effort
for the Philippines. In addition, $2.1 billion is requested to make
payments to NATO countries and the Philippines in return for rights
to maintain U.S. military bases on their soil.
   There also is a request for a long-term appropriation of $270
million to rebuild the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, which was
penetrated by Soviet listening devices. Of that amount, only about
$10 million is estimated to be spent in 1991.

   More than 20,000 demonstrators chanting
``We're fed up!'' rallied in front of the Parliament Monday to
demand pay raises and to protest price hikes in foodstuffs and
public transport.
   ``We do not want to use our final weapon, the general strike,
but we are not ruling it out either,'' said Sandor Nagy, general
secretary of the official central trade union federation, which
helped organize the protest.
   About 4,000 demonstrators later marched to the television
headquarters to demand their views be broadcast, the official MTI
news agency reported.
   The demonstration followed a series of price increases earlier
this month, part of a government plan to cut the budget deficit and
let the market set prices. Meat prices rose 32 percent, dairy
products 42 percent, bread 20 percent and cigarettes and liquor
more than 20 percent.
   On Thursday, public transport fares will go up 55 percent.
   The austerity program is designed to prove to the International
Monetary Fund that the government is serious about cutting
subsidies, a condition for receiving Western credits.
   The official unions said the program will push almost a third of
Hungary's 10.6 million people below the proverty line, set at $83 a
month.
   Protesters carried banners with the slogans ``European Wages for
European Prices!'' and ``We always sacrifice, but to what result?''
   One protester, Amalia Kis, living on $56 a month, said she
bought no fuel during the winter and spent her days in the public
library ``because they have heat there.''
   The demonstration was called by the Iron Workers Union and
endorsed by the National Council of Trade Unions to press for an
increase in the minimum montly wage to $85 and an $8 wage increase.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth has rejected higher wages without
corresponding increases in productivity.
   Members of the League of Independent Trade Unions did not attend
the rally, and a spokesman said workers should talk with company
managers instead of the government, which will turn over power
following elections in March.
   ``We understand the people's anger, it is fully justified, but
this demonstration is unnecessary and harmful,'' said Csaba Oery,
the league's spokesman.

<HEAD>Bush Asks Tiny Increase for USDA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday proposed an
``austere'' 1 percent budget increase for the Agriculture
Department for fiscal 1991, with nearly one-third of the $48.7
billion he requested targeted for food stamps.
   As part of the overall department budget, the president proposed
a $1.5 billion cut in commodity programs. The cuts, which were not
detailed, would likely mean that farmers would get lower guarantee
prices and reduced direct payments for major crops such as wheat,
feed grains and cotton.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter called the proposed budget
``austere, but ... by no means dracronian.'' The Bush
administration projects inflation this fiscal year at 4.1 percent.
   If Congress does not go along with the commodity cutback, the
USDA budget could balloon by 4.2 percent next fiscal year, from
$48.2 billion to $50.2 billion.
   Details of the proposed $1.5 billion in commodity program cuts
were left to negotiations between the Bush administraton and
Congress. Initial Democratic response was not enthusiastic.
   Nutrition programs would account for $23 billion of the USDA
budget _ with about $15.4 billion going for the food stamp program.
That is up about $600 million from this year, mostly because of
higher food costs and upward adjustments in monthly allocation to
needy families.
   State child nutrition programs, at $4.8 billion, would be down
about $150 million from this year but would allow for an increase
in school lunch subsidies for middle-poverty children who now pay a
reduced rate for meals. Children from the lowest-income categories
get meals free.
   Under the proposal, the reduced-rate meals would cost a child 20
cents instead of the current 40 cents.
   The women, infants and children (WIC) program would account for
$2.2 billion, up from $2.1 billion this year and a reflection of
rising participation.
   The Bush budget for the year beginning Oct. 1 calls for scaling
back the Federal Crop Insurance Corp., which provides subsidies to
farmers who carry all-risk protection for crop loss. The agency's
budget _ $1.2 million this fiscal year _ would fall to $430,000.
   In place of the crop insurance program, a new disaster
assistance program would be worked out with Congress.
   Net outlays for USDA commodity programs _ a wide range of
subsidies for crops, dairy products, honey and wool _ were
projected at more than $10.2 billion in 1991.
   But that assumes Congress will approve the $1.5 billion in cuts.
If lawmakers reject the plan, commodity subsidies would rise to
about $11.7 billion in 1991 from $8.4 billion this year.
   That would still be far less than the record level of $25.8
billion in 1986. The subsidy programs, provided by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., dropped to $22.4 billion in 1987 and to
$12.5 billion in 1988.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, said in a statement that ``efforts to
balance the federal budget cannot be allowed to destroy one of our
greatest accomplishments, which is to provide `safety net' levels
of support'' for farmers.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said the administration's budget ``suggests they will
continue to cut target prices and (price support) loan rates until
the farm programs are effectively abolished.''
   Under the system, the CCC payments mostly run a year behind the
events, meaning that the 1991 budget proposed by Bush will be for
crops grown in 1990, and so on.
   The sharp drops in net outlays the last two years reflect the
1988 and 1989 droughts, which reduced production and drove up
commodity prices. That meant less need for payments to farmers,
thus reducing CCC outlays.
   With farmers planting larger acreages this year and a probable
continuation of normal yields for the major field crops, total
spending on commidity programs is expected to jump in 1991.
   The budget also proposes a sharp reduction in Farmers Home
Administration spending to about $5.8 billion in 1991 from $7.1
billion this year.
   Most of the FmHA savings would be in farm loan programs, rural
housing and the elimination of ``business and industrial'' programs
to help improve local communities. The budget calls for a further
shift from direct loans by the agency to guarantees for private
lenders.

<HEAD>Namibian Assembly Proposes March 21 as Independence Date</HEAD>
<HEAD>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Constituent Assembly proposed
Monday that this southwest African territory declare independence
on March 21, ending 75 years of rule by South Africa. Namibia is
Africa's last colony.
   The 72-member assembly, elected in November, submitted the date
to Louis Pienaar, Namibia's South African administrator, who is
expected to approve. An assembly vote on the proposal is planned on
Tuesday.
   South Africa captured Namibia from the Germans in 1915. In
December 1988, it agreed to grant independence as part of a
regional treaty that also calls for phased withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor. More than 6,000
U.N. military and civilian personnel have been supervising the
transition process since last April.
   The constituent assembly also has been debating a democratic,
Western-style constitution and is to begin voting on the document
Tuesday article-by-article.
   No major disagreements are expected, because all leading parties
represented in the assembly say they support the proposed
constitution.
   The draft constitution contains a declaration of fundamental
rights, including freedom of movement, freedom of speech and
freedom of the press. It foresees a multiparty democracy, regular
elections, an independent judiciary and an executive president
limited to two five-year terms.
   One provision that may lead to dissension allows for detention
without trial during a state of emergency or in time of war. An
individual could be detained without charge if that person was
deemed ``a clear and present danger to the security of the state.''
   SWAPO, the leftist South West Africa People's Organization which
had fought a bush war for independence from South Africa since
1966, won 41 seats in the assembly and will form the first
government. SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma is expected to become Namibia's
president.
   The multiracial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, which wants
Namibia to have a free enterprise economy, has 21 seats. Five
parties share the 10 remaining seats.
   Two-thirds of the assembly, or 48 members, must approve each
article of the constitution.
   The South African Defense Force, South-West Africa Territorial
Force and the South-West African Police fought SWAPO in the
northern part of the territory in a war that killed 20,000 people,
mostly guerrillas, over 23 years. The last fighting in the country
of about 1.5 million occurred in April 1989 at the outset of the
U.N.-supervised independence process that resulted in elections in
November for the constituent assembly.
   The territory is composed of sparsely populated areas. The
territory, as large as France and West Germany combined, contains
11 main ethnic groups, including two mixed-race groups, eight black
groups and about 75,000 whites.
   The Ovambo people, who inhabit the relatively fertile northern
region, make up about half the population.

<HEAD>Authorities Seeking Pardon for Man Jailed for Eight Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said Monday they'll seek a pardon for
a man who has spent almost eight years in prison for robbery
because of new evidence supporting the man's alibi.
   Michael Anthony Woten, 36, was found guilty of robbing a grocery
store of $5,200 on April 16, 1982. He was arrested May 7, 1982,
convicted of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and sentenced
to 55 years in prison.
   During his trial, Woten testified that he was hitchhiking to St.
Louis on the day of the robbery. But Woten could only identify the
truck driver who picked him up with his citizens' band radio handle
of ``Kangaroo,'' said Deputy Police Chief Ray Hawkins.
   ``We had what we thought then was a pretty strong case,'' said
Hawkins. ``Five witnesses were pointing the finger at'' Woten.
   The Dallas Times Herald recently tracked down the truck driver
through an ad in a trucker's publication. Former trucker Don
``Kangaroo'' Fainter told the newspaper he remembered picking up
Woten in Oklahoma City and confirmed much of Woten's alibi that he
was hitchhiking on the day of the robbery.
   Evidence of the trip was found in the Centerville, Ky., office
where Fainter's former employer stored company records.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said prosecutors are
awaiting written information from the police before proceeding with
a pardon request.
   ``We are just waiting for the police to physically give it to us
so that we will be knowledgeable enough to ask the governor and
Board of Pardons and Paroles to pardon him,'' Vance said.
   Hawkins said Woten had written several news agencies claiming
his innocence, after which the Times Herald interviewed him and
brought police a written outline of what Woten said had occurred.
   ``We investigated it and were able to find some written
documentation that substantiated what he had to say,'' Hawkins
said. ``While there is a modicum of evidence that he still might be
guilty, there is now a reasonable doubt and that is all that is
required to turn him loose.''
   Woten had enclosed an affidavit from a fellow inmate, which said
the inmate committed the robbery. Authorities have not said what,
if any, action will be taken against the inmate.
   ``Is this for sure?'' Woten told the Times Herald when informed
he might be freed. ``In all honesty, this has happened so fast, you
know ... They're not going to change their minds, are they?''
   It could not be determined Monday when Woten would have been
eligible for parole. Calls by The Associated Press to various state
officials were not returned.
   The Woten case is latest in a string of dubious convictions in
Dallas County. The most publicized was that of Randall Dale Adams,
subject of the film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' who was freed last year
after spending 13 years in prison after he was convicted of killing
a Dallas police officer.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Down Payments on VA Loans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Though it's now the Veterans Department, the short form is
still the familiar ``VA.''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

   The Bush administration's proposed 1991 budget
requests more spending on the health-care needs of the nation's 27
million veterans but would require down payments on on its home
loans for the first time.
   The proposed budget also asks for Congress to approve
legislation ending the mobile home loan program. The Veterans
Department cited high foreclosure losses, particularly among active
duty military personnel, as the reason for ending that Vietnam-era
program.
   In another area, the administration proposes nominal fees for
middle-income veterans who seek treatment for non-service connected
disabilities at VA facilities. None of the individual fees for such
services as prescriptions and outpatient visits would exceed $10 a
day. The measure is supposed to bring in $112 million.
   The proposed $30.1 billion budget for the department calls for
spending of $12.4 billion for health care, compared with the $10.8
billion sought last year by the administration. After an increase
by Congress and a slight cut to meet Gramm-Rudman targets, spending
this year is estimated at $11.4 billion.
   The total budget request would exceed current spending by $1.4
billion.
   This is the first VA budget proposal since the VA achieved
cabinet status. Secretary Edward J. Derwinski attributed the
increased funds to his agency's greater public visibility.
   ``I think the president understood early on that they can't
shortchange us,'' Derwinski said.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee praised Derwinski, a former Republican
congressman from Illinois, saying the health care budget is ``the
best VA medical care budget request by a president in more than a
decade.''
   ``Secretary Derwinski took his case directly to President Bush
and did a tremendous job in convincing im that the downward spiral
in VA health care must be halted,'' he said.
   ``This is a fair and realistic budget coming from the White
House and one of the best we've seen in years for veterans,'' said
Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Lawmakers and veterans groups have complained that VA's ability
to care for an increasingly aging veterans population was eroded by
the Reagan administration.
   The VA does substantial work with AIDS victims and those
suffering from drug abuse, and cares for a growing number of
elderly patients. The budget shifts more funds in those directions.
   The budget gives more than $500 million in pay increases to the
current staff and adds $100 million to hire more than 2,300 people,
including 800 nursing positions. The hirings would bring the total
staff to close to the 194,720 mandated by Congress.
   The House and Senate are currently working on legislation to
increase nurses' pay, and both veterans committees in both houses
have promised legislation this year to raise salaries and benefits
for doctors and dentists.
   Amvets, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of
America and Veterans of Foreign Wars say $13.4 billion is needed
just to return basic services to the level available in 1988.
   The Bush proposal also proposes a 4 percent down payment for VA
loans and an increase to 1.75 percent in the in the fee borrowers
must pay to a VA mortgage insurance fund.
   Down payments have never been required by the government in the
history of the program, and the insurance fee had already increased
from 1 percent to 1.25 percent in January.
   Raymond H. Avent, the acting chief benefits director, defended
the proposal, saying the impact would be minimal and is necessary
to save the program from huge loan losses.
   He said that since the first $25,000 of a loan would be exempt
from the fee and the usual home costs $80,000, the home loan would
require only a $2,200 to $2,300 down payment.
   ``The potential is much greater'' that the borrower will not
walk away from a mortgage with that much money invested in it,
Avent said.
   Veterans organizations complain that VA is constantly blaming
veterans for problems in the loan system instead of its own
mismanagement of the program.
   Cranston called the down payment feature ``the most
objectionable'' feature of the budget proposal.
   ``Congress created the program in 1944 precisely to allow
hundreds of thousands of veterans to purchase homes even though
they could not come up with a downpayment,'' he said. ``The same
need is here today.''

   President Bush asked Congress on Monday to
increase NASA's 1991 budget by 17.5 percent, including money for a
start on his plan to send astronauts back to the moon and, later,
to Mars.
   NASA would be authorized to spend $14.1 billion in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, an increase of $2.1 billion over this fiscal
year.
   The space agency's spending authority _ different from the
one-year budget in that authority includes money for projects that
wouldn't be completed and paid off until later years _ would rise
by 24 percent, from $12.3 billion to $15.1 billion.
   Bush also was generous to other fields of scientific research,
adding $895 million for basic non-defense research, for a total of
$10.9 billion, and a $2.1 billion increase for applied research and
development, for a total of $14.4 billion.
   Among the areas proposed for a boost was the National Science
Foundation, $2.2 billion, a 13 percent increase; AIDS research,
increasing by $749 million to $3.2 billion, and the superconducting
Super Collider, budgeted for $293 million, a 56 percent increase.
   Bush also asked for a 20 percent rise in financing science and
engineering education, proposing to bring federal investment in
that area to $871 million.
   The president's request to Congress ``demonstrates the
administration's continued strong support for NASA and the civil
space station,'' NASA administrator Richard H. Truly told a news
conference.
   ``It reflects the president's belief that investment in space
yields substantial benefits _ vastly expanding scientific
knowledge, developing valuable new technology and, especially
important, lifting the dreams, imagination and spirit of our
nation.''
   A major beneficiary would be the manned space station, which the
United States hopes to have in orbit late in the decade. Authority
for the station would increase from $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion as
the project moves from design to the fabrication stage. The first
construction flight is scheduled for the spring of 1995.
   If approved by Congress, the space budget would pay for starting
the so-called ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' an ambitious program to
study the Earth's environment using satellites and instruments.
   The budget request includes $661 million in spending authority
to study the Earth, including money to start two polar-orbiting
platforms, the first of which would be launched in 1998. It also
would initiate the development of Earth probes, a series of smaller
instruments focused on specific, high-priority data needs,
including ozone depletion. The first would be launched in 1994.
   The budget proposes a total of $3.3 billion for space science
and $101 million for programs to promote the commercial use of
space. Space science includes such major flight projects as the
Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Magellan mission to venus, both
underway, plus the Hubble Space Telescope, set for an April launch.
   Proposed funds ``directly relatable to exploration are a little
bit less than $1 billion,'' Truly said. When exploration
expenditures included in the budgets of the Defense Department and
other agencies are added in, he said, the amount will be more than
$1.3 billion.
   Last July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, the president set a goal of having the United States return
to the moon and then to begin manned exploration of Mars early in
the next century.
   The budget request reflects the first steps toward that goal in
a $179 million authority item for ``exploration technology,'' which
includes $4.5 million for lunar and Mars science, and $11 million
for nuclear propulsion studies.
   Bush's proposal also envisions development of two new robotic
missions, the Lunar Observer and Lifesat. The latter would be a
series of reuseable satellites designed to carry living speciments
into orbit and be returned to Earth for analysis of the effects of
long-term exposure.
   The National Aero-Space Plane, a joint NASA and Air Force
project, would receive a total $277 million in spending authority.
An additional $129 million in joint funds is proposed for develping
a new family of launch vehicles.
   NASA had planned a record 10 flights in calendar 1990 but had to
postpone one, because of delays in flying the recent satellite
retrieval mission and a delay in the anticipated spring launch of
the Hubble Space Telescope. The budget calls for 10 flights in each
of the next two fiscal years, leading up to a planned flight rate
of 12 a year.
   The budget would also enable NASA to increase employment from
23,735 to 24,466.
   ``With more than 85 percent of NASA's appropriation going to the
private sector, we simply must have the in-house expertise to
manage contract performance,'' Truly said.

<HEAD>Bush Targets More Money for Renewing, Cleaning up Nuclear Arms
Plants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday proposed a nearly $1
billion increase in spending authority to modernize decrepit U.S.
nuclear weapons plants and clean up their environmental messes.
   Bush's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
includes $9.95 billion for nuclear weapons development and
production, as well as environmental cleanup at the 17 major
weapons facilities owned by the Energy Department.
   That compares with slightly more than $9 billion currently
allocated to the Energy Department for those purposes.
   All the figures are for budget authority, which represents
ceilings on actual outlays to be determined separately. The
department used budget authority figures for the plant
modernization project because funds are spent over several years
under long-term contracts.
   About two-thirds of the proposed $1 billion increase is for
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins' new plan to clean up radioactive
contamination and toxic wastes at the weapons plants and bring the
facilities into compliance with environmental laws.
   Bush called for $2.75 billion in spending authority for cleanup
and waste management for fiscal 1991, an increase of about $600
million over current levels. Estimates of the total cleanup costs
range from $65 billion to $100 billion in spending over 30 years.
   Watkins said most of the rest of the increase would go toward
making nuclear weapons plants safer and more modern.
   Bush also proposed a 20 percent boost in spending on development
of two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium, a critical
ingredient in nuclear warheads. The new reactors would replace
damaged facilities at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C.
   Watkins said it's possible that only one new reactor would
suffice, but he stressed his view that no such cutback should be
made until more is known about how reforms under way in the Soviet
Union will affect Western security interests.
   Watkins also confirmed that he decided to halt plans for
building a high-technology plutonium refinery in Idaho. The $1.2
billion project, known as the Special Isotope Separation plant,
will be phased out starting April 1, he said.
   The energy secretary said the department had determined that the
Idaho refinery was not needed to meet plutonium requirements for
weapons production, but that overall spending on the weapons
complex must increase to meet defense needs.
   ``Until arms control is a fait accompli, we have to demonstrate
that we have the will to keep our strategic stockpile'' adequate,
Watkins told a news conference.
   He said a viable weapons production complex was as important as
the warheads themselves in deterring a Soviet attack.
   Watkins said the government had failed for years to invest
adequately in nuclear weapons plants, thus leaving them vulnerable
to breakdowns and unsafe operation. Many key facilities are closed
for safety and management improvements.
   ``We're trying to put the investment back in here to ensure that
this doesn't become the Achilles heel at the (arms control)
bargaining table for the United States,'' he said.
   Watkins also announced that a facility at the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation, near Richland, Wash., that had been designed to
provide plutonium for the space program would be shut down over
four years, beginning this year. He said the department decided it
would be cheaper for the Savannah River plant to provide the
plutonium.

   President Bush, hailing moves toward democracy
throughout Eastern Europe, said Monday that ``the world,
increasingly, is on the side of God.''
   Bush, in a speech to the annual convention of the National
Religious Broadcasters, also said ``I believe with all my heart
that one cannot be America's president without a belief in God,
without the strength that your faith gives to you.''
   He got a rousing response from the crowd of about 2,000,
particularly when he expressed opposition to abortion, saying, ``I
support the sanctity of life,'' and when he reiterated his support
for a constitutional amendment permitting voluntary prayer in
public schools.
   Bush has been a regular speaker at the broadcasters'
conventions. Monday's address marked his fourth appearance before
the group.
   ``We believe that political values without moral values, a moral
underpinning, cannot sustain a people,'' Bush said.
   He recalled his comment in his inaugural address that ``the day
of the dictator is over,'' and said, ``Indeed, the last year has
been a victory for the freedoms with which God has blessed the
United States of America. We have seen the rights of man move
mountains or _ as in East Berlin _ even move a wall.
   Bush said the changes in Eastern Europe ``were propelled by many
things, faith not the least of them.'' He said that as
pro-democracy demonstrations spread across Europe, ``the day of the
dictator did end.''
   The president praised the role of religious figures in
democratic revolutions, and singled out a Romanian Orthodox priest,
Gheorghe Calciu, who spent 21 of his 64 years in jail and was
spared at the last minute from a death sentence.
   Addressing the priest, who was in the audience, Bush said,
``Father, it's an honor to salute you. ... I know, too, you hope to
return to your native land.''
   ``And in this season of miracles, who can doubt you will?,''
Bush said. ``For today, the times are on the side of peace, because
the world, increasingly, is on the side of God.''

<HEAD>Mandela's Release Reportedly Delayed Because of Unrest</HEAD>

   News reports Monday indicated
the release of Nelson Mandela may be delayed because of unrest, and
an aide said the black leader will resume his political struggle
even if it means going back to jail.
   The government is considering delaying Mandela's release until
March because of renewed unrest, including protests against a
touring English cricket team that has defied a ban on sports
contacts with South Africa, according to several newspapers.
   On Monday, police fired tear gas at a Roman Catholic church to
break up about 1,000 people who gathered to plan a protest rally
against the cricket team.
   Organizer Paul Ntuli said dozens of people suffered minor
injuries at the Pax Nova church near the central city of
Bloemfontein. Police confirmed the incident but declined to give
any details.
   In downtown Johannesburg, police used batons and tear gas to
disperse more than 1,000 black railway workers following a union
meeting. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Government leaders were concerned that releasing Mandela and
other pending reforms would inflame unrest and officials want to
slow down reforms to ensure they retain control of developments,
said reports citing unidentified sources.
   The Star reported Monday that no decision had been made on when
to release Mandela and the decision would be left to President F.W.
de Klerk.
   De Klerk had not set a date for release because he did not want
to meet demands that the government also legalize the African
National Congress, the main black group fighting the white-led
government, the paper said.
   Mandela, 71, has been imprisoned since 1962, and is serving a
life term for helping plan the start of the ANC's anti-government
sabotage campaign.
   The South African media has been swamped with reports and
speculation on when Mandela might be released and the issue is
dominating political life. The government has said it intends to
free Mandela but has not given any date.
   De Klerk is expected to outline government reforms Friday in an
opening address to new session of Parliament. De Klerk, who says he
wants to end discrimination, could announce Mandela's release.
   However, the Rev. Allan Boesak, a leading anti-apartheid figure,
said Mandela's release must be accompanied by reforms such as
lifting the state of emergency and legalizing the ANC and other
banned organizations.
   ``It has not yet been shown that Mr. de Klerk has either the
vision or the courage to make this moment a moment of historic
importance,'' Boesak said.
   An anti-government demonstration is planned outside Parliament
to coincide with de Klerk's speech.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of the jailed nationalist leader, said
after seeing her husband in prison Saturday that problems had
arisen and his release could be delayed.
   In Oslo, Norway, veteran ANC leader Walter Sisulu said Mandela
``is ready for release at any time. I know that Mandela would be
making certain demands, but I do not know if they are conditions.''
   Dullah Omar, a close friend of the Mandela family, said Mandela
has made it clear the government must make basic reforms to clear
the way for talks between whites and blacks.
   ``If and when he is released and there have been no major
changes, then he will report back to his organization (the ANC)
that three years of talks (with the government) have been a waste
of time,'' Omar said.
   In an allusion to resuming armed struggle, Omar said, Mandela
``will go back to where he left off, before he went to prison, and
will probably find himself back in prison in a month.''

   A new storm headed for the northern Pacific Coast on Monday with
a threat of wind and rain, snow scattered over the Northeast closed
schools, and rain fell along the East Coast.
   High wind warnings were issued along the Oregon coast and
inland, and over sections of Washington. A winter storm watch was
posted for the Oregon Cascades and the mountains of northeastern
Oregon.
   Snow fell during the early afternoon from southern Maine to
central New England, much of New York state, the northern and
western two-thirds of Pennsylvania, much of Ohio, eastern Indiana,
southeastern Lower Michigan and north-central Kentucky.
   The snow forced scores of New York schools to close as a
precaution and was blamed for at least one death in weather-related
road accidents in that state.
   Binghamton, N.Y., reported 5 inches of snow by afternoon. Two to
4 inches fell at Albany, Glens Falls and Poughkeepsie, the National
Weather Service reported.
   ``A lot of areas will end up with 6 to 12 inches before it's all
over,'' said Ken LaPenta, a weather service meteorologist in Albany.
   Rockingham, Vt., got 1{ inches of snow in 2 hours.
   Accumulations over north-central Pennsylvania included about 7
inches across Lycoming County, 6 inches at Laporte, 5 inches over
Clinton County, and 2{ inches to 5 inches over Tioga County. Eight
inches fell at Laurel Mountain Park.
   To the south of that area, rain fell from southeastern
Pennsylvania to Maryland, much of Virginia, West Virginia,
southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, North
Carolina, western South Carolina, northwestern Georgia,
southeastern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
   A few thunderstorms were scattered over Georgia and northern
Florida.
   Elsewhere, snow fell from the Idaho Panhandle to northwestern
and north-central Montana.
   Strong winds blew across Wyoming, with morning gusts to 58 mph
in Cheyenne and 55 mph in Casper.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph in Scottsbluff, Neb., and in Colorado at
Fort Colllins, Boulder, Longmont, and the Air Force Academy.
   A winter storm watch was in effect into Tuesday morning across
northwestern and north-central Minnesota.
   A cold front moved into Montana during the morning, lowering
temperatures by as much as 20 and 25 degrees. At noon, the wind
chill at Cut Bank was 50 degrees below zero.
   Marquette, Mich., posted a record high of 34 during the
afternoon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 4 below
zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 84 at both Fort Myers and Vero Beach,
Fla.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 below zero at
Warroad, Minn.

<HEAD>Democrats Lambast Bush Budget on All Fronts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats attacked President
Bush's 1991 budget on all fronts Monday, calling the $1.23 trillion
spending plan too soft on the Pentagon, too harsh on domestic
programs and too reliant on rosy economic projections.
   Republicans leaped to Bush's defense, even though many of them
had to concede that parts of the president's proposal would never
be enacted and that the budget year likely would be a tough one.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we were unable to reach agreement
up here this year,'' Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the Senate
Budget Committee's ranking Republican, conceded to reporters.
   In a preview of a theme likely to dominate the year's Capitol
Hill fiscal wars, majority Democrats pounced on Bush's call to
spend $303.3 billion for overall defense spending.
   That figure _ a 2 percent cut from this year's $296.3 billion
when compared to the costs of inflation _ was derided by many
Democrats as being too generous to the military at a time of easing
tensions with the Soviet bloc.
   ``It is becoming apparent that if there is to be a peace
dividend that amounts to anything, this Congress is going to have
to carve it out,'' complained Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``You'd think Joe Stalin had come back and
entrenched himself in the Kremlin.''
   ``It is a Rip Van Winkle budget that has not yet awakened to the
changes in the world or the major challenges at homes,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Yet noticeably lacking was the phrase that became the reflexive
reaction among Democrats to many of the budgets that President
Reagan sent the lawmakers: ``Dead on arrival.''
   ``I think we'll take it very seriously,'' said House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   But like other members of his party, Gephardt called the
spending blueprint a ``stand-pat budget'' that fails to seriously
address many of the nation's problems.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
lauded Bush's proposals to boost spending on the Head Start
preschool program for low-income children by $500 million to $1.9
billion. But he chided the president for offering overall education
increases _ to $24.6 billion _ that fail to keep abreast of
inflation, and for cutting heating bill subsidies to the poor.
   ``A budget should make a statement about a nation's priorities
and aspirations,'' Byrd said. ``The only clear statement made by
this first Bush budget is, `Read my lips, not my actions.'''
   Also criticized were Bush's projections for an economy growing
2.6 percent this year _ well below the rate that congressional
economists and many private analysts expect. More optimistic
forecasts allow the White House to boost its projections for
revenue collections, thus making the deficit appear smaller.
   ``The return of the rsy scenario,'' said Rep. William H. Gray
III, the House's No. 3 Democratic leader, referring to the name
adopted for the economic estimates Reagan used. ``Dancing all over
the American economic landscape when all the indicators indicate
that we're not going to have that kind of growth.''
   Commenting on what he said was a lack of a bold attack on the
deficit _ which the administration thinks it will cut from an
estimated $123.8 billion this year to $63.1 billion in 1991 _ House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said, ``This is a
take two aspirin and call me in the morning budget.''
   The Democratic barrage prompted some Republicans to retort that
if Democrats don't want to adopt the Bush proposal, it is up to
them to produce an alternative.
   ``Congress always feels the need to be different, no matter what
the president suggests,'' said the House Budget Committee's ranking
Republican, Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota. ``But Congress is
obliged to produce a budget resolution of its own _ or to signify a
willingness to negotiate with the president right off the bat.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recommended
Monday closing or scaling back more than 72 U.S. military
installations and ending operations at 12 overseas facilities, a
plan that immediately drew congressional fire.
   ``I understand the problem they're faced with, but it's
absolutely vital that Congress have the guts to make the right
decisions as we go through this period of time,'' Cheney said as he
released his $292.1 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan _ with the
base closing proposal _ and signaled lawmakers that the battle has
begun.
   Cheney said he had no figures yet for the potential savings from
the moves. He said the numbers were still being analyzed.
   But because it costs money to shut bases down and legislation is
needed to do so, the savings are not usually accrued until years
later.
   The plan, far less extensive than the 86 closings and five
realignments that Congress adopted last year from a federally
mandated commission, calls for closing a significant number of
facilities in California.
   Among the candidates for closure there are Fort Ord, Alameda
Naval Aviation Depot and Naval Air Station, Long Beach Naval
Shipyard, Moffett Field Naval Air Station and Oakland Naval Supply
Center in California.
   Asked whether politics influenced the choices on the closing
list, which largely targets bases in the districts of liberal
Democrats on Capitol Hill, Cheney said the charge ``wasn't a valid
one.''
   ``I did not assemble this list,'' said the former Republican
congressman from Wyoming. The list was complied by the services,
said Cheney, who smiled at suggestions that the services may have
been political in their choices.
   Other Cheney proposals include deactivation of the 2nd Armored
Division at Fort Hood, which would involve the loss of 12,000
troops. A Republican, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, rushed into action
to try to work out a deal to save the division.
   ``We worked out an agreement that if we are able to successfully
negotiate round one of the conventional disarmament agreement with
the Soviets, that would bring home 21,600 Army personnel from
Europe, and the first 12,000 of those would go to Fort Hood,''
Gramm said in Texas.
   But he added, ``The Army is looking at a reduction of 135,000
men in uniform. There's no way you can do that without affecting
us. We want to minimize that effect.''
   The overseas bases where the United States would end its
operations or realign forces include seven in Europe, six in Asia
and a Naval Air Station in Bermuda. Of the 14, all would be closed
except the Bermuda air station and naval communications station in
the Philippines, which would have some forces shifted.
   The European bases include two in Greece _ Hellenikon Air Base
and the Naval Communications Station in Makri; one in West Germany
_ Zweibrucken Air Base; three in England _ RAF Fairford, Greenham
Common and Wethersfield; and one in Italy _ Comiso Air Base.
   Comiso and Greenham Common are home to Air Force cruise missile
installations that are being dismantled under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union,
signed in December 1987.
   The Asia bases on Cheney's list are a Navy base in San Miguel,
Philippines; two bases in Turkey _ Eskisehir Munitions Storage Site
and Erhac Air Base; and three in South Korea _ Kwang Ju, Suwon and
Taegu.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said in a statement that the base closure proposals
``will be controversial.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee, said her military installations
subcommittee will be taking a close look to ensure that the
closings are not partisan.
   Cheney's list actually is a proposal to study which bases should
be eliminated. Closing a base also requires a lengthy series of
environmental impact statements which often lead to delays.
   A handful of bases on Cheney's proposed list were part of the
closure and realignment list Congress approved last year, including
Fort Sheridan in Illinois, Fort Meade in Maryland, Letterkenny
Depot in Pennsylvania.
   The recommendations from the defense secretary would effectively
cancel or completely realign the remaining work at some of those
facilities.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee and a gubernatorial candidate whose state is
particularly hard-hit by the base closings, said he didn't ``think
some of them make sense,'' particularly the Long Beach shipyard
which has met target dates on spending and repairs.
   Wilson said the closings will have to be examined thoroughly
because of the previous shutdowns, ``the savings were peanuts.''
   In Long Beach, the area's chamber of commerce president, Bob
Creighton, said the closing of the shipyard could mean as much as
$100 million a year to the local economy.
   ``The chamber plans to work quite closely with our city
officials, our congressional delegation and the shipyard employees
themselves to do everything we can to convince Congress that the
closing of our shipyard would be a mistake,'' Creighton said.
   Meanwhile, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said the
U.S. decision to withdraw its forces from three Royal Air Force
bases was compatible with NATO's objectives.
   ``We're satisfied that the decision is reasonable and
compatible'' with the current conventional arms talks in Vienna.

<HEAD>Gov't Spending Plan Intended to Cope With Wave of Soviet Immigants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Israeli government Monday outlined a $31.3
billion budget for 1990-91 that is intended to cope with a growing
number of Soviet Jewish immigrants and hold the line on defense
spending.
   ``Immigration and what it encompasses is determining the fate of
this year's budget,'' Finance Minister Shimon Peres said in
presenting the spending plan to the Knesset, or parliament, for
approval.
   Peres later told army radio Israel ``has to think of other
possible sources of money for absorbing immigrants.''
   The budget would increase the value-added tax by one percentage
point to 16 percent and hike taxes on fuel and cigarettes.
   But Peres rejected any other taxes or special assessments,
saying they ``could slow the pace of getting out of the recession
and increase the rise in inflation.''
   Parliament is expected to approve the budget with little debate
or change.
   The Finance Ministry said the proposed budget takes into account
``two main events, the expected growth in the immigration from the
Soviet Union and the stagnation in economic activity in 1989.''
   The economy grew just 1 percent each of the last two years, and
Israeli officials have largely blamed the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Under the proposed budget, spending would grow by $5.3 billion,
or about 19 percent, over the 1989-90 budget. However, when
adjusted for inflation _ about 20 percent in 1989 _ there would be
little change in real value.
   The deficit is projected at $2.11 billion. Last year's budget
provided for a $900 million deficit, but it wound up at $2.34
billion.
   The Finance Ministry said the budget would provide $600 million
to cover immigration costs for 40,000 Soviet Jews in the new fiscal
year, or double the amount spent in 1989-90. It said another $200
million would be provided by the Jewish Agency from donations
abroad.
   But the ministry said revised estimates indicate as many as
100,000 Soviets could come this year and that an additional $500
million would be needed to resettle that number of immigrants.
   The defense budget anticipates the Palestinian uprising, now in
its 26th month, will continue in 1990-91.
   At total of $6.27 billion is budgeted for defense, up from $5.3
billion in the previous year. But the increase of 18 percent does
not make up for inflation, military experts said.
   The Defense Ministry estimates its uprising-related expenses at
about $225 million. But it has budgeted only $75 million, so it
will have to cover the balance by cutting spending in other areas,
the ministry said.

<HEAD>A Billion New Trees and Tougher Pollution Law Enforcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's 1991 budget would spend at
least $1 billion more to protect the environment in programs
ranging from planting a billion new trees to tougher enforcement of
pollution laws.
   The Environmental Protection Agency would be given an additional
$332 million to spend on an array of programs including cleaning up
toxic waste dumps, tougher enforcement of existing laws and
implementation of stricter air pollution requirements now being
considered by Congress.
   The agency's overall proposed budget for the fiscal year
beginning in October is $5.8 billion, 6 percent more than this
year's estimated expenditures. The administration projects
inflation this year to be 4.1 percent.
   ``Today, a consensus is emerging ... (that) investments in
maintaining and restoring the health of the environment can now be
seen as a responsible investment in the future,'' said the
president's budget document sent to Capitol Hill.
   Under a broad category of activities that encompasses more than
a half dozen agencies and departments, the administration said it
wants to spend $7.6 billion for major programs to protect the
environment, including a number of initiatives under an umbrella
program entitled ``America the Beautiful.''
   The spending would reflect an increase of about $1.2 billion for
the various programs, officials said.
   Reflecting the heightened concern about global environmental
issues such as the effect of pollution on the earth's warming and
on the destruction of the ozone layer, the budget calls for
authorizing $1 billion in spending for research into global
changes, 50 percent more than now is being given such efforts.
   In another initiative aimed at dealing with global warming, Bush
proposed spending $175 million next year to begin a long-term
program aimed at planting a billion trees a year on private land
across the country. The program also would help local communities
begin tree planting efforts.
   Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a leading pollutant linked to
global warming. Scientists suggested the tree-planting effort would
have only marginal effect on overall global warming, however.
   Bush, who has vowed to end the dramatic decline in recent years
of environmentally vital marshlands, called for spending $460
million next year on wetland protection under programs administered
by a half dozen agencies, an increase of $88 million over this year.
   The president also proposed buying additional lands for national
parks and said the Forest Service would eliminate ``below cost''
timber sales at nine national forests located near urban centers
and make those forests more accessible for recreation. The budget
provides $10 million for additional recreational facilities at the
nine forests.
   ``The budget shows a marked departure from nearly a decade of
decline and destruction of America's environmetnal programs,'' said
Paul Prichard, president of the the private National Parks and
Conservation Association.
   But some environmentalists were not as enthusiastic.
   ``It falls far short of what is necessary to restore
environmental protection in the United States and around the
world,'' said Brent Blackwelder, a vice president of Friends of the
Earth. He said many environmentalists believe ``at least $5 billion
in new environmental spending is called for.''
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said at a news conference that
the president's budget ``at a time when new money is very hard to
come by ... represents a significant commitment ... to assure that
the public is protected from the most serious environmental threats
now and in the future.''
   Reilly noted that the budget calls for hiring 245 additional
people to help administer the Clean Air Act, which he expects to be
approved by Congress later this year, and for hiring 292 additional
people in the agency's enforcement program.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Cuba Plans to Jam U.S. TV Broadcasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuba's U.N. envoy said Monday his nation
will jam planned U.S. television transmissions to Cuba and warned
broadcasters face serious disruptions in ``this so-called radio war
or TV war.''
   Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, who assumed his post last week, said
the U.S. government's plan to transmit TV broadcasts into Cuba
violates international telecommunications agreements.
   ``It is the same as taking from us part of our land, our sea,
our air space,'' he told reporters.
   ``We are not creating this so-called radio war or TV war. They
are the ones who did that,'' he said of U.S. broadcasters.
   Alarcon said Cuba has previously disrupted transmissions from
the United States and warned further interruptions ``will have
serious consequences'' for U.S. stations.
   ``We have given them some examples just to remind their
technicians that it is perfectly possible,'' Alarcon said.
   ``You can disrupt our TV services or our radio services but they
can also suffer the same consequences if you do the same from the
South to the North.''
   The United States has been broadcasting radio transmissions to
Cuba via Radio Marti _ named for Cuban patriot Jose Marti _ for
about five years. Last year, Congress provided money for television
broadcasts to Cuba.
   On another matter, Alarcon said Cuba will not resume the
withdrawal of its troops from Angola until it is assured that
U.S.-backed rebels in the African nation will not attack Cuban
soldiers.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan
government in a 15-year-old civil war with the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) began a phased pullout a
year ago under an accord signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
UNITA was not party to the accords but pledged not to attack the
Cubans as they withdrew.
   News reports from Havana said Cuba and Angola temporarily
suspended the withdrawal pending an investigation into a UNITA
guerrilla raid Jan. 21 on a water pumping station guarded by Cuban
troops. Four Cubans were killed and seven wounded, U.N. officials
said.
   The rebels have said they didn't know Cubans were in the area at
the time.
   ``As long as we don't receive a satisfactory explanation of what
happened and also the necessary assurances that such a thing cannot
ever be repeated ... the withdrawal continues to be suspended,''
Alarcon said.
   He also said his nation is pleased it will have an opportunity
to play a heightened role in U.N. negotiations next month as
president of the 15-member Security Council. The rotating
presidency will give Cuba reponsibility for setting the council's
agenda and more involvement in negotiations between member nations.
   Cuba was elected to the council last year as representative of
the Latin American nations, the first time since the Cuban
revolution in 1959 that it has served in that capacity.

   The government accused opponents
Monday of attempting a coup and supporters rallied behind it,
occupying the offices of one opposition party and forcing another's
leader to flee in an armored car.
   More than 15,000 people rallied in Bucharest to support the
self-appointed government that took over when Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed and executed last month. News media
reported similar demonstrations in several other cities, but gave
no details.
   On Sunday, about 15,000 people protested in the capital,
demanding the resignation of the Council of the National Salvation
Front, the name adopted by the government that is running the
country until elections planned for May 20.
   After initially declaring its only purpose was to guide Romania
through the immediate post-revolutionary period, the Front recently
said it would enter candidates in the elections.
   That decision angered the fledgling opposition, which says the
Front _ 150 intellectuals, technocrats and former Communists _ has
an unfair advantage.
   Many opposition politicians have pointed to the Communist pasts
of leading Front members and suggested it really is the Communist
Party in disguise.
   As the thousands of pro-government demonstrators gathered Monday
outside Front headquarters in Victory Square, three of Ceausescu's
henchmen pleaded guilty in court to complicity in genocide.
   Former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, former Central
Committee secretary Emil Bobu, and former Politburo member Manea
Manescu, along with Ion Dinca, a former Politburo member who
pleaded guilty Saturday, admitted supporting Ceausescu's order to
shoot demonstrators at the revolution's outset.
   About the Sunday protest, Front member Silviu Brucan said it was
organized by the Peasants Party, which was a dominant presence in
Parliament before World War II and is thought to be the strongest
opposition party now.
   Brucan, a ranking Communist who fell out with Ceausescu after
criticizing his dictatorial methods, told reporters the rally was
an attempt to overthrow the Front.
   ``Their shock troops came close to the main entrance of the
building,'' he said. ``The whole event amounted to a putsch, a coup
d'etat.''
   Peasants Party spokesman Ion Ratiu said of Brucan's allegations:
``The whole thing was turned around to justify their actions
today.''
   He spoke at a news conference called in the hotel room he has
called home since returning last week from decades of self-exile in
Britain.
   Ratiu, a wealthy shipbuilder and real estate investor, accused
the Front of staging Monday's demonstrations. Many protesters
arrived at Victory Square in buses and trucks.
   Another pro-government rally formed around the building that
houses Peasants Party headquarters, about two miles from the Front
building, and at the nearby Liberal Party headquarters.
   ``We won't leave until you dissolve the party!'' demonstrators
chanted as they forced their way into Liberal headquarters.
Peasants Party leader Corneliu Coposu was evacuated building by
soldiers in an armored car.
   No injuries were reported at either headquarters. Brucan said
three people suffered stab wounds to the back during Sunday's
protest, but that none was in serious condition.
   Brucan denied Ratiu's claim that the Front staged and paid for
the demonstrations Monday, but several people outside the Peasants
Party building indirectly suggested they had been under pressure to
demonstrate. They said they worked in state factories and had
joined their bosses at the pro-government rallies.
   A woman who would not give her name claimed the Sunday
demonstration also was less than spontaneous. ``They were given
dollars, cigarettes and lei,'' she said, referring to the Romanian
currency.
   Both days of demonstrations violated a ban the Front has put on
rallies that lack advance authorization from the police.
   The Front has decreed that rallies should not take place during
working hours, but made no attempt to disperse Monday's
pro-government demonstration.

<HEAD>Ford Employees Start Back to Work While Union Dissidence Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one-third of the workers at a Ford
Motor Co. plant outside Mexico City returned to their jobs Monday
after a dispute between factions of a labor union sparked a 22-day
shutdown, a Ford spokesman said.
   ``We expect to resume full operation probably by the end of this
week,'' said the spokesman, Carlos Bandela.
   At least 150 thugs entered the plant Jan. 8, killing one worker
and injuring nine following a dispute between union leader Hector
Uriarte and workers who considered him pro-management.
   After the flareup, protesting unionists took over Ford
installations and demanded Uriarte's ouster. Authorities issued an
arrest warrant charging Uriarte with masterminding the violence.
   The company closed the plant, saying it could not guarantee the
safety of its workers.
   The confrontation was the latest in a series of struggles
between old-guard Mexican union bosses and employees who want more
democratically run unions.
   The dissidents refused an offer of a referendum because union
officials wouldn't agree to provisions for ensuring a fair vote,
dissident leader Salvador Fuentes Reyes.
   Newspaper reports Monday said dissident union members were
maintaining a picket outside the company installations in
Cuautitlan, 15 miles north of Mexico City.
   ``It's an intra-union problem,'' said Bandala. ``It's almost
resolved.''
   Bandala said 1,200 union employees went back to work Monday and
another 1,200 were expected to rejoin the labor force on Tuesday.
   The 3,800-member work force normally produces 450 cars and
trucks a day.
   ``We lost 450 units a day for 22 days,'' Bandala said.
   He did not have an estimate how much the shutdown cost the
company.
   He said the company is negotiating with Fidel Velazquez, head of
the Mexican Workers Federation to which the Ford union belongs.
Negotiations will determine whether union members will receive back
pay for work time lost when the company closed the plant.

   Head Start, the highly touted preschool
program, would receive $500 million more under the 1991 budget
proposal President Bush sent Congress on Monday. The 36 percent
increase would be the largest one-time jump for the program since
it began 24 years ago.
   Bush is asking Congress for $1.9 billion budget in multi-year
spending authority for Head Start for fiscal 1991, enough to raise
enrollment from 450,000 to 667,000 _ 70 percent of children aged 3
through 5 from low-income families.
   Bush's budget message to Congress called the program ``a key
component in achieving the readiness of all children to start
school.''
   Besides giving preschoolers the social and learning skills to
help them thrive in grade school, Head Start _ an agency of the
Health and Human Services Department _ screens children for medical
and dental problems and gives them two meals a day.
   The president seeks an identical $500 million in budget
authority for the Education Department _ $24.6 billion compared to
$24.1 billion this year.
   For fiscal 1991 alone, Bush asked Congress to approve a budget
of $23.7 billion, a 6.2 percent increase over this year's $22.3
billion budget. The administration expects inflation this year to
be 4.1 percent.
   The education budget targets $1.8 billion for initiatives and
priority areas, including preschool, elementary and secondary
education; mathematics and science education; dropout prevention;
adult literacy, and drug education.
   For the Chapter One program, which provides special educational
services for low-achieving elementary and secondary students, Bush
requests a a $600 million increase to $5.1 billion.
   And for the Even Start program, which provides basic education
srvices to parents together with their children aged 1 through 7,
Bush seeks to double the multi-year budget authority to $48 million.
   In the area of education for the handicapped, the budget
proposes spending $2.2 billion in fiscal 1991, a $500 million
increase that would provide more services to 355,000 preschool
children and would enhance the state programs that serve all
infants up to the age of 2, and their families.
   ``The 1991 budget proposes the highest spending levels ever for
programs to prepare children for school and for discretionary
education programs,'' said the budget.
   However, Bush's budget requests cuts in certain student loan
programs for college students, including a $600 million decrease in
the Guaranteed Student Loan program, to $3.2 billion from $3.8
billion.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said that the student loan
expenditures would fall in 1991 because of a projected decrease in
interest rates.
   While Bush requests a $473 million increase in the Pell Grants
program, which provides money to college student, over the current
$4.8 billion, the budget seeks to cut the program next fall by
$66.5 million.
   As a result, about 14,000 students receiving awards averaging
$200 would lose their grants, and 1.3 million other students will
have their stipends cut by $50.
   The budget also seeks budget authority of $230 million for math
and science education, a 70 percent increase over what Congress
provided in 1990; $239 million for adult literary, an increase of
more than 25 percent; and a $50 million increase to $590 million
for drug prevention and anti-abuse programs.

<TEXT>
   At least two ethnic Albanians were
killed and 20 seriously injured Monday in battles with police on
the sixth day of unrest in troubled Kosovo province.
   Eight deaths have been confirmed since last Wednesday in the
latest wave of violence between police and ethnic Albanians who
demand free elections and the lifting of a 12-month-old state of
emergency.
   The official news agency Tanjug said one protester was killed in
Urosevac, 30 miles south of Pristina, capital of Kosovo, and the
second died in Gnjilane, 6 miles south of the city.
   Tanjug said, without elaboration, that ``several policemen''
were injured in clashes with demonstrators throughout the province.
   Yugoslavia's collective state presidency and the government
issued separate statements, both describing the Kosovo situation as
``extremely grave'' and promising ``resolute action'' against
ethnic ``Albanian extremists and separatists.''
   Riots began last year after the Serbian republic, of which
Kosovo is an autonomous province, made constitutional changes to
take tighter control.
   About 90 percent of the people in the impoverished southern
province are ethnic Albanians, predominantly Moslem. The minority
Christian Serbs say the Moslems in Kosovo, which is adjacent to
Albania, want to force them out.
   Tensions were heightened Monday by the resumption of trial
proceedings against 14 ethnic Albanians, including the province's
former Communist leader, charged with inciting a wave of unrest
last year that left at least 25 people dead.
   After a brief court session, the trial was rescheduled for Feb.
5, apparently because of the tense situation, the state Tanjug news
agency said.
   In the city of Podujevo, about 30 miles north of Pristina, riot
police lobbed tear gas and used a water cannon to disperse about
2,000 demonstrators.
   Tanjug said 8,000 people assembled at Drenica, 25 miles
northwest of Pristina, for ``peaceful demonstrations.''
   Hundreds of people lined up on the sidewalk of Pristina's main
street to sign a petition calling for democratic elections, the
lifting of martial law, and the release of all ethnic Albanian
political prisoners.
   ``Only a democratic dialogue can solve the present problems of
Kosovo, this is our contibution to its start'' said Yusuf Berisha,
head of the Association of Sociologists and Philosophers. His group
is part of the opposition coalition that drew up the petition.
   Berisha said 2,000 people had signed the petition in the first
two hours.
   ``We expect more than one million people to sign it,'' said
Zekeria Cana, secretary of the Kosovo human rights committee,
another coalition member.
   Bogdan Kecman, a leader of Kosovo's minority Serbs, rejected any
dialogue with the ethnic Albanian movements, however, describing
them as ``terrorists and separatists.''
   ``We demand that the state give us weapons to protect lives from
the Albanians,'' he told reporters.

<HEAD>FBI To Lose 400 Agents Under Bush Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI would lose 400 agents under President
Bush's proposed 1991 fiscal-year budget, largely because of a new
overtime law that will cost the bureau an extra $42 million,
officials said Monday.
   Congress, never eager to cut the FBI budget, must approve the
proposal.
   If Congress agrees, the reduction will be absorbed by the
resignation or retirement of agents, usually between 450 and 480
each year, Deputy FBI Director Floyd Clarke said.
   But ``right now, our hiring program will have to be almost
stopped in 1991'' if the budget is not changed, Clarke told
reporters at a budget briefing. ``We just have to work harder,'' he
added. ``We will get the job done.''
   The cuts at the FBI contrast with proposed increase in the
number of Drug Enforcement Administration agents from the current
level of 3,167 to 3,547 in the next fiscal year.
   ``There is no question the drug war is receiving a very high
priority,'' said Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer. ``It is
the highest priority in the department.''
   At the FBI, the manpower cut would mark only the second time in
11 years the bureau has reduced the number of agents on its
payroll. The 1981 fiscal year budget cut 93 agents from the FBI's
workforce.
   Proposed increases for such high-priority FBI efforts as
organized crime and white-collar criminal investigations will
partially offset the reductions in the bureau's workforce, which
includes more than 10,000 agents.
   But even these sections of the FBI will experience net cuts in
manpower despite Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's repeated vow to
attack ``crime in the suites'' that has spawned fraud in the
savings-and-loan and securities industries.
   ``Those priorities remain the attorney general's priorities,''
said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel. But the FBI's ``job
is to manage the operation within the budget provided them. We will
be working with the bureau's management ... to ensure ... there
will be no diminution of effort in the priority areas.''
   The proposed $1.54 billion budget calls for a net loss of 41
agents assigned to white-collar investigations and six agents
investigating organized crime, Clarke said.
   To meet deficit-reduction targets, $25.7 million will be cut
from the FBI's budget, eliminating 227 agents. In addition, the FBI
plans to cut 559 agents from its payroll to finance the higher
costs of overtime under a new law enacted by Congress.
   Budget increases for such high-priority enforcement programs as
white-collar and organized crime would add 388 agents to the FBI's
authorized workforce, a net loss of 400 agents, according to budget
documents.
   Paying FBI agents at higher overtime rates will cost the bureau
an estimated $41.9 million in the 1991 fiscal year, according to
budget documents.
   Under the new law, agents' overtime is paid at a rate pegged to
their actual pay grade. Previously, all agents over Grade 10 earned
overtime pegged to that salary grade.
   The change means that a senior agent will earn up to $15,000 in
overtime each year instead of $6,000 or $7,000, Runkel said.
   Virtually every FBI agent earns overtime, and Runkel suggested
that the bureau could better manage the time of agents to reduce
this expense.
   The new overtime law, sponsored by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
will cost the Justice Department more than $66 million. The figure
includes overtime increases for Border Patrol, immigration and DEA
agents.
   The Office of Management and Budget originally agreed to finance
the additional overtime expenses but later forced the department to
absorb that cost through program cuts, said a department source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled about
116,000 of its 1986 and 1987 Aerostar minivans with optional
captain's chairs because of possible seat-belt damage.
   Ford said webbing on the right front passenger seat belt may
have become worn and, if so, would be replaced by dealers. In
instances where webbing has not been worn, Ford will send consumers
protective sleeves for the seat belts.
   The optional captain's chairs recline, have heavier arm rests
and a higher back than standard seats. About 60 percent of all
Aerostars made for those two years contained the optional seats and
are subject to the recall, Ford spokesman Jim Trainor said.

<TEXT>
   The president of Lebanon's American
University of Beirut said Monday that a three-day meeting had eased
tensions between campuses in Moslem west Beirut and the city's
Christian sector.
   Students at the branch campus in Christian east Beirut have
refused to attend classes for two weeks, alleging the university
administration, based in the Moslem sector, was discriminating
against them.
   University President Frederic P. Herter flew from New York to
the port of Larnaca on the south coast of Cyprus to attend the
meeting of administrators and faculty from both campuses.
   He denied reports that the east Beirut branch wanted to become
an autonomous university, but conceded it had ``inadequate
representation of ... interests on the main campus.''
   Herter said faculty at the east Beirut branch want more students
admitted, charging the administrators in west Beirut who review
applications had discriminated against Christians.
   ``There have been no irregularities or prejudicial activities in
the admissions on the part of the main campus,'' he said.
   Enrollment at the Christian branch dropped this year from about
1,000 to about 900. About one-fifth of the 5,100 students at the
main campus also are Christian.
   Herter said it will ``take a lot of good will'' to resolve
problems, with faculty ``on both sides willing to go back and
forth'' between the two sectors of Beirut.
   The extension was set up in 1977 when continued fighting made it
more and more hazardous to cross the Green Line that divides the
city into sectarian zones.
   The U.S.-affiliated university has suffered heavily in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Fighting last year forced the campus to close for six months. It
reopened Oct. 9.
   Herter has not been to Beirut since 1985, when Moslem extremists
began kidnappings of Westerners, including several faculty members
at American University. Three have been killed.
   Two are still being held: acting dean of agriculture Thomas
Sutherland, a Scottish-born U.S. citizen, and Brian Keenan, an
English language professor who holds dual Irish and British
nationality.
   Herter said it was ``good news'' that Sutherland, kidnapped in
Beirut on June 9, 1985, had been reported alive and well by a
London newspaper.
   The Sunday Correspondent said Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem
sources in Beirut confirmed Sutherland was being held with Briton
John McCarthy, a television journalist kidnapped on April 17, 1986.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Curb Farm Abuses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush pledged Monday to work with
Congress to prevent some individual farm operations from collecting
excessively large federal subsidies.
   ``Failure to do so will result in a loss of public confidence
and support for the farm program,'' Bush said in his proposed
budget for fiscal 1991. ``The taxpayers rightly expect these abuses
to be curbed.''
   The 1985 farm law limits the amount of income-support payments
under various crop programs to $50,000 per person each year. The
limit on total federal subsidies is $250,000 per year for each
person.
   Those ceilings ``have been routinely exceeded'' because a
``person'' is defined as an individual or business entity, such as
a corporation or trust, the budget document said.
   The report included diagrams of how illegal joint ventures using
family members and other entities were set up to evade the $50,000
limit in 1988 and collect $912,089 in federal subsidies. Another
example showed payments of $801,619.
   Both examples were included last year in reports by the
Agriculture Department's inspector general.
   The budget document said that while reducing farm program costs
is important, the Bush administration ``also is concerned about the
distribution of those subsidy payments.''
   ``A significant portion of benefits goes to larger, wealthy
farmers,'' it said. ``In an era of limited resources, this is hard
to justify.
   In 1987, for example, 30 percent of the $22.4 billion in
commodity related subsidies went to 4 percent of the farmers who
had average net cash incomes of more than $100,000 per year and net
worths of nearly $850,000.
   ``This should be changed,'' Congress was told. ``One option for
achieving savings of approximately one-half billion dollars would
be to eliminate direct payments to farm operators with adjusted
gross incomes of over $100,000 per year.''
   The budget document added: ``This income level, after all,
represents three times the average for an American family of four.
Up to a billion dollars could be saved by withholding direct
payments to farm entities with gross sales of $500,000 per year or
more.''

<HEAD>Britain Shelves Identity-Card Plan for Reducing Soccer Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reversed itself Monday and shelved
plans to use identity cards as a means of reducing violence at
soccer games.
   The decision was announced after publication of a report on the
overcrowding that led to 95 spectators being crushed to death last
April at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, northern England.
   Judge Peter Taylor of the Appeal Court prepared the report,
which said using identity cards could cause crowding at turnstiles
and more deaths by crushing.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had supported the card idea
against a host of critics in politics and the soccer world.
   She indicated last week, however, that she would back down. The
reversal was confirmed Monday when Home Secretary David Waddington
told Parliament: ``The government have decided not to proceed with
the establishment of a Football Membership Authority.''
   The authority was supposed to control hooliganism by issuing
cards to fans that would admit them through computerized
turnstiles. The cards of known hooligans would have been
invalidated.
   Among problems with the plan was the unresolved question of
whether the courts or soccer authorities should decide who was a
hooligan. Also, the entire system would have had to operate through
a central computer register whose ability to handle up to 400,000
fans a week never was established.
   Waddington said the legislation would stay on the books for
possible activation if other methods failed.
   Abandonment of the card plan removes the cornerstone of the
government anti-hooliganism strategy while Britain is preparing to
send teams from England and Scotland to the World Cup tournament in
Italy this summer.
   Hooliganism devastated English soccer in the 1980s with riots,
field invasions and street battles involving English fans abroad.
In the worst incident, at a Brussels stadium in 1985, 39 people
were killed when Liverpool fans went on a rampage.
   Judge Taylor recommended legislation to outlaw running onto
soccer fields, throwing objects from the stands or shouting obscene
or racist remarks.
   He also supported experimenting with surveillance of suspected
hooligans by attaching electronic tracers to their legs, but
expressed ``grave doubts about the feasibility of the national
membership scheme and serious misgivings about its likely impact on
safety.''

   The rebels killed 12 men from the
southern region of Equatoria for refusing to join their ranks, an
official newspaper reported Monday.
   There was no immediate comment from the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army, and the report could not be independently verified.
   The daily Al-Inkaz Al-Watani also quoted the leader of the
military government, Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir, as promising to
defeat the southern rebels in the battlefield.
   The reported comments mark a change in strategy for el-Bashir
and follow intense fighting in the 6-year-old civil war.
   After he overthrew the civilian government of Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi last summer, el-Bashir promised to end the civil war
through peace negotiations.
   Al-Inkaz Al-Watani, quoting an unidentified official, said the
rebels had tried to force the young men to join their ranks to
replace troops lost in fighting. The paper said the men were killed
between the towns of Yei and Tambura.
   The mainly Christian and animist rebels began their civil war in
1983, demanding economic reforms and greater autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated government in the southern provinces of Bahr
el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.

   Salvage crews on Monday recovered a
sunken ferry that collided with another vessel in heavy fog and
capsized, killing at least 25 passengers and leaving another 75
missing, officials said.
   The accident Sunday was the fourth major river accident this
month.
   Officials said 150 people were on board the ferry when the
collision occurred on the River Lohali near Patuakhali, 90 miles
south of Dhaka.
   Officials in Patuakhali said by telephone that a salvage ship
using two cranes pulled three large portions of the ferry from the
river.
   Police and fire brigade divers found 25 bodies floating in the
river but none was found in the vessel, the officials said.
   The officials said that about 50 people on the roof of the ferry
jumped into the river after the collision and swam ashore. They
said most of the other passengers were inside the hull, however,
and had shut the windows because of the thick fog.
   At least 33 other people have drowned and another 122 are
missing and presumed dead in three similar accidents in the country
earlier this month.
   Boats and ferries are the most popular means of transport in
Bangladesh, a low-lying nation crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers.
   Accidents are common because many vessels frequently travel
without lights at night.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
thanked Parliament and its oversight committee on Monday for
reviewing and approving his $112 billion, five-year plan, Tehran
television reported.
   The ambitious plan is designed to revive Iran's war-shattered
economy.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency reported earlier this week that
the 12-member Guardian Council, which screens legislation for
conformity with Islam and the constitution, sent parts of the plan
back to Parliament for amendment.
   IRNA did not say what portions of the plan were found
objectionable, nor has it reported on its subsequent approval.
   Monday's broadcast quoted Rafsanjani as saying, ``I thank the
Guardian Council and the Parliament for approving the five-year
plan, and express the government's readiness to implement it in its
entirety.''
   Both the telecast and IRNA were monitored in Nicosia.
   It was not clear whether Rafsanjani was thanking the council for
giving the go-ahead to parts of his plan, or whether the blocked
portions of the plan had also been approved.
   He was speaking at an unusual meeting of Iran's top leadership
that the broadcast said was called to plan celebrations for the
upcoming 11th anniversary of the 1979 revolution that brought the
clergy to power. The anniversary is Feb. 1-11.
   The 270-member Majlis, or parliament, passed Rafsanjani's plan
after leading radicals blocking the plan bowed to a stern warning
by Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   The radicals, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, objected to Rafsanjani's call for foreign investment in
reconstruction projects, and his plan to privatize inefficient
government projects.
   Mohtashemi said this month he opposed any direct foreign
investment in Iran.
   But Deputy Finance Minister Mandi Navvab said Saturday Iran
welcomed foreign investment, and that Tehran's policies provided
grounds for mutual cooperation with foreign companies, IRNA
reported earlier.
   It quoted Navvab as saying foreigners were legally free to
invest in joint ventures with Iranian partners as long as the
foreign stake in each project did not exceed 49 percent.
   The Rafsanjani plan aims to triple non-oil exports in 1990-95 to
$9 billion a year. Iran now relies on oil and gas exports for about
95 percent of its foreign exchange.
   The program would rebuild industries following the eight-year
war with Iraq.

<HEAD>There's Something Fishy About Advertisements in Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wood products giant has been promoting
a takeover attempt involving 2.1 million acres in Maine with
newspaper advertisements showing a smiling sportsman with a big
fish.
   There's just one little problem: It's the wrong fish.
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has been running the full-page ad for
weeks in state newspapers to win the favor of residents in its
battle to buy Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $3.8 billion.
   At least two experts say the fish held by the fisherman in the
ad appears to be a striped bass, which lives in coastal waters and
not in northern Maine, the location of the 2.1 million acres at
stake in the takeover.
   ``I think it was a poor choice,'' state fisheries biologist Paul
Johnson said Monday. ``If they're going to show somebody with a
fish, they should show a fish from northern Maine.''
   The advertisement is headlined ``The Maine Facts About
Georgia-Pacific.''
   At the state Department of Marine Resources in Augusta, the ad
caught the attention of another fish expert.
   ``They're nowhere near the land that they're trying to
acquire,'' said Lewis Flagg, director of the department's
anadromous fish division. Anadromous fish, such as salmon and
striped bass, return from the sea to rivers and streams to spawn.
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reached at her office at
the company's Atlanta headquarters, said she had little information
about the fish picture.
   ``It was taken somewhere in New England,'' Ms. Smith said.
``It's intended to be a representation of sporting activities.''
   Johnson said from the Department of Inland Fisheries and
Wildlife office in Greenville that workers in his office began
laughing at the ad when it first began running. He said he was
surprised when it kept appearing over and over.
   ``It just finally grated on my nerves,'' said Johnson, who wrote
a letter to the editor of the Maine Sunday Telegram.
   ``The striped bass is hardly an appropriate species to choose in
promoting its quest to take over management responsibility for more
than 2 million acres of inland forest and water resources,''
Johnson's letter said.
   ``Wouldn't a picture of a trout, togue or salmon provide a more
persuasive demonstration of Georgia-Pacific's commitment to
Maine?'' the letter said.
   The striped bass has been introduced in some freshwater bodies,
particularly in the South, and Flagg said the state is trying to
develop a population in the Kennebec River.
   Johnson said the fish will probably never swim in the waters of
Great Northern's land.
   ``We're a long way from the coast,'' he said. ``They should just
change that damn picture in their advertisement.''

<HEAD>Britain Will Not Prosecute Moslem Leader on Incitement Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will not prosecute a British Moslem
leader who addressed a rally in October where crowds reportedly
supported a death threat against writer Salman Rushdie, the lord
chancellor said Monday.
   Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses'' is considered blasphemous
by many Moslems and the author has been in hiding since last Feb.
14, when the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called
for Rushdie's death.
   At a rally Oct. 21 in Manchester in northern England, Dr. Kalim
Siddiqui was quoted as asking participants to raise their hands in
agreement with Khomeini's death sentence.
   In its report on the meeting, the Daily Telegraph said nearly
all of the 250 Moslems present raised their hands.
   The director of public prosecutions, Allan Green, decided there
was insufficient evidence to prosecute Siddiqui on charges of
incitement to murder, said Lord McKay, the lord chancellor, who is
the country's chief legal officer.
   Lord McKay made the announcement in answer to a legislator's
question in the House of Commons.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' caused worldwide protests last year and
the publisher has delayed plans for a paperback version because of
continued Moslem death threats, The Observer newspaper reported
Sunday.
   It said Rushdie was angered by the decision and ``is now
claiming that his life will never be safe until the publishing
cycle is completed.''
   In a statement later Sunday, publisher Viking Penguin said: ``No
firm date has been established, but even if it had it would not be
the company's policy to reveal such information for obvious
security reasons.''
   A Viking Penguin spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
denied there was animosity between the publisher and Rushdie.
   The Observer, quoting an unidentified company source, said the
publishers will not produce the paperback as long as there is risk
to its staff, bookshops or the public.
   The hardcover edition of ``The Satanic Verses'' has become an
international bestseller, with sales of more than 1 million copies,
despite being banned in more than 20 countries. It was published in
fall 1988.

<TEXT>
   Avianca Flight 52's declaration of a fuel
shortage was relayed from regional traffic controllers to
controllers handling its approach, but the urgency of the warning
wasn't clear, authorities said Monday.
   The controllers were not told by the pilot that there was an
emergency, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar
said from Washington.
   Farrar said the word used was ``priority,'' which ``has no
particular meaning in air traffic control. If there is an
emergency, you use the `word emergency.'''
   The FAA report conflicts with information provided Sunday night
by the National Transportation Safety Board, which said the
regional controllers had not relayed word of the fuel shortage to
the local controllers.
   The Boeing 707 fell powerless into a secluded neighborhood of
Cove Neck on New York's Long Island on Thursday night, killing 73
of 159 people aboard, including the cockpit crew. More than 20
survivors remained hospitalized in critical condition Monday.
   Inspection of the crash site on a wooded hillside was nearly
complete Monday, and investigators focused on conversations of the
crew and controllers.
   The investigators said tapes show the crew warned a regional
control center that it was low on fuel about 45 minutes before the
crash, as it was circling over New Jersey in a holding pattern.
   The jet flew in three weather-related holding patterns totaling
nearly 90 minutes along the East Coast as it flew from Colombia to
New York City's John F. Kennedy Airport.
   ``We think we may need priority,'' a crew member told the
control center about 8:45 p.m., according to preliminary
transcripts, Farrar said Monday.
   A regional controller replied, ``How long can you hold before
you have to go to your alternate?'' The alternate landing site was
Boston.
   ``Wait a minute,'' the cockpit replied, pausing apparently to
check, the FAA said. ``We can hold five minutes.'' Shortly
thereafter, the cockpit said its alternate site was ``Boston. I
can't make it.''
   At that time, the FAA said, the regional controller telephoned
the control center that handles approaches and departures for
Kennedy.
   The regional controller said Avianca 52 had just come out of the
holding area ``and can only do five more minutes of hold. Can you
take him now?''
   The local control replied, ``Slow him to 180 knots and I will
take him.''
   After the call, the plane was released to Kennedy airport and it
made a landing attempt 37 minutes later through rain and fog, but
aborted the approach because it was coming in too steeply,
authorities said.
   Investigators say the Avianca crew agreed to a controller's
suggestion that the plane loop back over Long Island and come in
for a second attempt. It did so, the cockpit saying twice it was
low on fuel, but the engines soon quit and the plane crashed.
Investigators are looking at the fuel shortage as a cause.
   NTSB investigators Monday were interviewing regional controllers
and Kennedy tower controllers to determine the extent of their
knowledge of the fuel problems, and what was done about it.
   Asked about the conflicting reports of what information was
relayed between controllers, NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the
phone message from the regional center ``may not fully reflect what
went on. There may be more to that conversation. It may need to be
judged in a fuller context.''
   The FAA's duties include the nation's air traffic controllers.
The NTSB investigates transporation accidents.
   The FAA and the NTSB, as well as the controllers' association,
stressed Monday that Avianca's message was not urgent and did not
use the word ``emergency,'' which would have brought the plane
quickly back to Kennedy and cleared the way for a second landing
attempt.
   FAA standards for flight emergencies spell out instructions to
pilots.
   ``Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of
assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations,'' the FAA
instructions say. ``If, at any time, the remaining usable fuel
supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe
landing, the pilot should declare an emergency and report fuel
remaining in minutes.''
   The words ``emergency'' or ``minimum fuel,'' according to R.
Steve Bell, president of the Air Traffic Controllers Association,
``would have triggered an emergency response by controllers.
Stating that you are low on fuel does not imply an immediate
problem.''
   In Washington, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner
said that while he could not predict the outcome of the
investigation, he does not believe a lack of a sufficient number of
air traffic controllers was to blame.
   ``You should not prejudge an investigation before all of the
people are interviewed and all of the facts are in. But I believe
that when the evidence is all in, staffing will not be a factor,''
Skinner said, declining to answer further questions.

<HEAD>Some Journalists Say Panama's Press Still Not Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran journalists in Panama are
only half joking when they say Panama still has no opposition news
media, even after the overthrow of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega had suppressed virtually all opposition outlets. Last
week, officials of the Inter American Press Association said
freedom of expression had ``improved very much'' since the U.S.
invasion in December.
   Also, however, the IAPA officials expressed concern about 10
radio and two television stations taken over by the government and
the arrests of journalists connected with the old regime.
   Members of the committee, led by Ed Seaton of Seaton Group, said
the government assured them the cases ``would be dealt with in
accordance with Panamanian law.''
   In a country where the concept of freedom of the press has been
subjective, the old regime's collapse resulted in public
recriminations and confusing legal situations regarding old and new
media.
   There was little opposition to Noriega, and not one media outlet
now criticizes the U.S. invasion.
   La Estrella, owned by a close friend of Noriega, now supports
President Guillermo Endara's government as strongly as it did the
dictator.
   La Prensa, which Noriega closed, resumed publication earlier
this month and supports the new government.
   El Siglo reopened and attacked everyone and everything connected
with the old regime, especially La Estrella. It called Maj. Gen.
Henry Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army South, the most popular man
in Panama.
   Another publishing company, Panama America, was taken over 21
years ago when the government moved in during disputes between
minority and majority stockholders.
   After the invasion, the old majority owners returned, took over
the modernized facilities and started publishing two papers,
Critica Libre and Panama America.
   The immediate losers were 68 journalists who worked for the
pro-Noriega newspapers Critica, Matutino and La Republica. They
seek either reinstatment or severance pay, but the publishers say
the workers are not and never have been employees of Panama America.
   ``We are professional journalists,'' said Eva Montillo, former
assistant editor of La Republica. ``We did our job as journalists.
The newspaper's policy or ideology is something else.''
   Aristides Calvo, editor in chief of Editora Renovacion, as the
company was called in the Noriega years, is the only journalist
still detained by the new government. Complaints have been filed
against him that include extortion and ``apology for crime.''
   Endara's government has taken custody of at least 10 radio
stations and two television stations owned by people believed to
have been connected with Noriega.
   Most continue operating. Government officials say they were
taken over so investigations could determine whether public funds
were used to buy them.
   Some may have to be returned, including the largest television
station, Channel 2. Its owners include former pro-Noriega
presidential candidate Carlos Duque and Eduardo Diaz Herrera,
former second-in-command of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Diaz Herrera broke with Noriega in mid-1987, accusing the
general of electoral fraud, drug trafficking and other crimes.
   Less clear is the case of Channel 5, which seemed to belong to
whoever was president.
   It first was owned by former President Ricardo De La Espriella,
whom Noriega forced to resign.
   When Noriega made Eric Arturo Delvalle president, Delvalle also
got control of Channel 5. When Noriega had Delvalle dumped, the
television station became the property of the government agency
that had financed its purchase.
   Panama America may become a serious headache for the new
government, both in ownership and labor problems.
   ``We will have to face it sooner or later,'' a government
official said privately. ``The old group left, scared by the U.S.
Army. It was a de facto situation. There are no legal documents
involved.''
   Majority stockholders sued the government when their facilities
were taken over and they kept the case open 21 years. They told
IAPA they will go to the Supreme Court to clear up the matter.

   Former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood's attorneys on Monday lost another bid to have charges
against him dismissed on the opening day of his trial in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   ``... I feel that this show should not go on, at least not
here,'' Hazelwood attorney Dick Madson said in arguing that the New
York seaman should have been charged under federal rather than
state law.
   Hazelwood, 43, was the captain of the Exxon Valdez when the
tanker ran aground March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   He faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor
charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted on all
counts, he faces up to seven years and three months in prison and
$61,000 in fines.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone denied Madson's motion for
dismissal of the charges, saying it lacked substance. Earlier
defense efforts to get the indictment against Hazelwood dismissed
also failed.
   Madson said federal law prevails to guarantee consistent rules
from port to port regardless of which state a vessel is in.
   ``Federal laws and regulations have covered this field for 200
years and there's a good reason for it,'' he said.
   Hazelwood sat in the courtroom as Johnstone dealt with
preliminary matters for 90 minutes before instructing attorneys to
spend the rest of the day examining standard, three-page
questionnaires completed by prospective jurors.
   Johnstone said he expects jury selection to take less than the
two weeks attorneys in the case predicted.
   Still pending is a defense motion to keep from evidence the
results of a blood-alcohol test that Hazelwood failed about 10
hours after the tanker struck Bligh Reef and began spilling oil in
early-morning darkness.
   The spill blackened shores and killed wildlife, resulting in
what Exxon Corp. calculated was a $2 billion cleanup. Some state
officials and others say the work is not over and should continue
this spring and summer.
   About 90 people have been summoned as candidates for the
12-member jury.
   The questionnaire for jurors includes questions about experience
with vessels, work in the oil and fishing industries, familiarity
with the oil spill and personal economic loss or gain tied to the
spill.
   The trial is expected to last more than six weeks. Defense
attorneys and prosecutors have said each side will need about three
weeks to present its case.
   Hazelwood originally was scheduled for an October trial in
Valdez, the port from which the tanker sailed a few hours before
the crash. But the trial for the Huntington, N.Y., seaman was moved
to Anchorage to increase the chance of a fair proceeding and to
take advantage of a larger jury pool and facilities.
   About 30 prospective jurors a day will be considered, the judge
said. A larger number will be screened if a panel of 12 plus
alternates cannot be found from the pool of 90.
   Nearly all of the people in the courtroom Monday were from the
news media. Johnstone's first business of the day was a briefing
for reporters, photographers and camera crews concerning courtroom
rules.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle won
assurances Monday that Panama will reform its banking practices to
deter drug-money laundering, but public details were few and
Panama's president suggested any changes would be ``not that
profound.''
   Quayle later flew to Jamaica as he wound up a three-country tour
to Latin America and the Caribbean, during which leaders in the
region criticized the U.S. invasion of Panama and pressed for
withdrawal of American troops.
   Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said his government is
not ready to agree to U.S. urging to recognize the Panamanian
government of Guillermo Endara. Manley also complained that
potential U.S. cuts in aid will hinder his nation's ability to
fight illegal drugs.
   In Panama City, Endara stood beside Quayle at a news conference
and declared that Panama ``cannot continue to be a center for narco
dollars.'' But Endara, facing opposition from Panama's bankers,
also said, ``We don't know yet what exact changes will have to be
made in our banking laws. We're working on that now.''
   Endara, who was installed as president at the start of the U.S.
military strike that ousted Manuel Antonio Noriega, said that some
of what the Bush administration wants can be accomplished simply by
enforcing current laws.
   During Noriega's rule, Panamanian banks were accused by U.S.
authorities of serving as centers helping traffickers ``launder''
drug money _ sanctioning transactions that made it difficult to
track the money.
   Quayle said he was impressed with Endara's willingness ``to move
in a different direction ... where we will be able to detect this
type of activity much easier than before.''
   Quayle, who arrived back in Washington on Monday night, told
reporters en route from Jamaica that he had telephoned President
Bush with a ``very upbeat'' report on the trip.
   He said that while Venezuela and Jamaica both insist on some
sort of election in Panama before they're willing to recognize the
Endara government, ``as far as we're concerned he's legitimized
now.''
   Quayle said the election last May 7 that was invalidated by
Noriega was won fairly by Endara. ``It was a free and fair
election.''
   However, he said it's up to the new Panama government to decide
whether it will hold new elections.
   The vice president's talks with the Endara government produced
agreement on a need for stricter enforcement, for stronger
requirements for banks to report large deposits, and for
negotiations on exchanging tax information concerning people under
investigation in drug cases, said a senior official traveling with
Quayle.
   ``I don't think that the bankers are opposing just any
changes,'' Endara told reporters. ``The bankers want changes that
are reasonable and will not duly change the banking environment.
They know that Panama cannot continue to be a center for narco
dollars.''
   Jamaica was the last stop of Quayle's three-day trip that
focused on regional ramifications of the Dec. 20 U.S. military
invasion of Panama.
   Manley said the vice president's visit did not change his
government's opposition to the military action.
   Although Jamaica strongly opposed Noriega, Manley said, ``We
also feel very strongly about the principles of sovereignty that
are involved in the invasion of any country by another.''
   ``Although we have an understanding of what led to the action,
we could not agree with it,'' he told reporters in a joint news
conference with Quayle.
   ``We are good friends but friends do not always agree,'' he said
of U.S.-Jamaica relations. Jamaica is worried about pending cuts in
U.S. economic support because ``if there is a cut at all it makes
it that much harder to fight the war on drugs,'' Manley said.
   He previously has complained that the United States planned to
cut all of Jamaica's $25 million in economic support money, which
was part of a total $124 million aid package in 1989.
   Quayle assured him, ``We simply are not going to stand by and
allow a zeroing out of the economic support funds.
   ``We take that very seriously,'' he said about the potential
impact on anti-drug efforts.
   Quayle noted that a majority of the foreign aid money is
earmarked for a handful of countries. He said the administration
wants Congress to provide more flexibility in distributing the
remaining money.
   After his talks with six heads of state at Saturday's
presidential inauguration in Honduras and with the Panamanian
leaders, Quayle was receptive to the idea of more aid to the
beleaguered countries of the region, one aide said.
   Panama had sought $2 billion to help it recover from the
invasion and the economic stranglehold of two years of U.S.
sanctions against Noriega's regime.
   President Bush last week said he was prepared to supply Panama
with half that amount.
   Before leaving Panama City, Quayle took a driving tour of the
impoverished Chorrillo neighborhood. Several blocks were leveled by
fire and bombing during the U.S. attack, including the headquarters
of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Force.
   As his motorcade slowly drove by the area, onlookers gathered in
groups and peered out windows, watching in stony silence. Their
reaction was in stark contrast to the enthusiastic cheering Sunday
from a well-dressed congregation at a Roman Catholic church Quayle
attended in another neighborhood.

United States on Monday for an influx of Soviet Jews to Israel, an
increase that Arab officials fear will drive Palestinians out of
the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The Soviet Union also drew Arab fire, as newspapers echoed PLO
chief Yasser Arafat's call Saturday for Moscow to reverse itself
and curtail migration of its Jews to Israel.
   The Kremlin on Monday blasted the Israeli government's decision
to settle Soviet emigres in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and said the move complicates plans to allow even more Soviet Jews
to emigrate.
   ``We strongly condemn endangering Soviet emigres by using them
to crowd Palestinians out of their own land,'' said the Soviet
statement, which was reported by the official Tass news agency.
``This policy reveals plans to create a `Greater Israel' above all
at the expense of the Palestinian people.''
   In Jerusalem, spokesman Yosef Amihud of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry attacked the Soviet statement as having ``many
irregularities concerning the Israeli position'' and added:
   ``As for the insinuations that Israel was using the Jews coming
out of the Soviet Union to crowd Palestinians out of their own
land, this has no base.
   ``The government of Israel has no policy that determines where
an immigrant will live and every immigrant is free to choose where
he will live.''
   Amihud said Moscow had not followed up an agreement reached with
Israel a year ago in Cairo that teams of experts from the two
countries meet.
   He said ``Israel hopes that the Soviet Union will use its
influence on Arab nations ... (to) answer the Israel peace plan''
and that the Soviets pursue ``freedom of entrance and exit.''
   Immigration activists in Jerusalem asked Monday for an emergency
evacuation of more Soviet Jews, who they said are endangered by
anti-Semitism and possible pogroms.
   Israeli officials have predicted 300,000 Soviet Jews will arrive
in Israel within three years under relaxed Soviet emigration
procedures.
   Speaking in Cairo, Saddam said the influx is causing ``plain and
serious harm'' to the Palestinians.
   ``We regard the United States as a participant in this
immigration because of its policies,'' said Saddam, standing beside
President Hosni Mubarak, whose Egypt is the only Arab country at
peace with Israel and is among Washington's closest Arab friends.
   ``If the United States were preventing nationals of other
countries from settling in it, we would say that this is a general
practice,'' he said.
   ``But for the United States to let in all kinds of immigrants
and prevent only Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union and East
European countries, this can only mean that it is opening only one
door to them. Namely, Israel's door.''
   The United States has a country-by-country quota for immigrants,
with an annual global total of 270,000.
   Until the Soviet Union removed many of the restrictions on
potential emigrants, the U.S. quota never was filled. Its 50,000
quota for the fiscal year ending in June, much higher than
previously, was filled by a backlog from last year and as many as
400,000 more are expected to apply for refugee status in the coming
year.
   In Tunisia, the Arab League's secretary-general, Chedli Klibi,
on Monday discussed Jewish immigration with Robert H. Pelletreau
Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunis and Washington's designated
channel for dialogue with the PLO. Details were not revealed.
   Arafat and other Arab leaders say settling Soviet and other
immigrants in the Israeli-occupied lands would make a Middle East
peace settlement more difficult, if not impossible.
   Israel took the two territories from Egypt and Jordan following
the 1967 Middle East War. If hundreds of thousands of Jewish
immigrants settled there, the Arabs fear Israel would be reluctant
to relinquish any part of the territories the PLO want as a
Palestinian state in confederation with Jordan.
   About 70,000 Jews live in the West Bank and Gaza, home to about
1.7 million Palestinians.
   The United Arab Emirates' newspaper Al-Bayan quoted Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, as saying Arab
foreign ministers will meet Feb. 5 in Tunisia. He said their
subject will be whether to approach Soviet and East European
officials to stop their Jews from going to Israel.

<TEXT>
   Parents who refuse to accept a
jury's innocent verdicts in the McMartin preschool child
molestation trial urged prosecutors Monday to keep the case alive.
   Parent Robert Currie failed as promised to produce new evidence
during two news conferences that drew about 50 reporters to this
beachside community that was the focal point of the nation's
longest, most expensive criminal trial.
   Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were
acquitted Jan. 18 of 52 child molestation charges in connection
with the now-defunct McMartin Pre-School. Jurors deadlocked on 13
other counts against Raymond Buckey.
   In announcing the news conferences, Currie sent out notices
stating, among other things, that he would display hundreds of
police reports.
   Instead, he appeared at the first news conference outside the
Manhattan Beach Police Department and read a child's graphic
descriptions of a molestation that allegedly occurred in 1985 _
claims similar to those rejected by the jury during the trial.
   As he stood on the street surrounded by news cameras, a driver
passing by shouted ``Kill Buckey!''
   Asked why he had called the news conference, Currie said, ``To
show the people and to show the jury they have made a mistake.''
   He said he wanted to bring pressure on District Attorney Ira
Reiner to refile the 13 undecided molestation charges against
Raymond Buckey. A decision on that matter is to be announced
Wednesday.
   Currie's child was not a complaining witness in the trial,
although he alleges the boy was molested.
   At the second news conference, a mother, Leslie Floberg, told
reporters she believes her son was molested six years ago at a
preschool at St. Cross Episcopal Church in nearby Hermosa Beach.
That preschool is now closed.
   Church officials were questioned during the McMartin
investigation because one of the alleged victims said he was taken
to a church, where animal sacrifices were held. No charges,
however, were ever filed against church officials or workers,
though three of the church's priests have since resigned.
   The church's volunteer youth minister was arrested recently on
sex abuse charges. The youth minister has since been fired by St.
Cross.
   ``I came because the media was depicting St. Cross as a victim
of the McMartin case,'' Mrs. Floberg said. ``There are things going
on here that need to be questioned. We have a moral
responsibility.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel on Monday offered to mediate peace talks between Israel and
Palestinian leaders, and invited PLO chief Yasser Arafat to visit
Prague, his spokesman said.
   Israeli vice premier Shimon Peres visited Prague Jan. 21 to
discuss restoration of diplomatic ties broken off in the 1967
Mideast War, and a future visit by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   Last Thursday, Havel received the PLO ambassador to Prague,
Samil Abdul Fattah, and spoke of Czechoslovaks seeking peace in the
Middle East.
   ``Czechoslovakia could play the role of a mediator in the
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, should the two sides so wish,''
Havel's spokesman Michael Zantovsky quoted the president as saying.
   Havel received the Palestine Liberation Organization's
ambassador to Prague, Samil Abdul Fattah, last week.
   Zantovsky said the president ``supported the right of the
Palestinian people to their own home,'' while expressing
``understanding for Israeli anxiety based on thousands of years of
painful experience of the Jewish nation.''
   After Zantovsky spoke to a news conference, Havel himself
appeared. One reporter asked whether his latest diplomatic
initiative was not of a ``messianic nature.''
   Havel said he hoped to make up for decades of Czechoslovak
passivity in the Middle East. Czechoslovakia was an active early
supporter of Israel, but the past two decades adopted a foreign
policy style that Havel and Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, close
friends and former dissidents, are now activating.
   ``If somebody makes an offer to two countries involved in years
of tragic war, to help, and yet makes the impression of a Messiah,
than you can call it that,'' Havel commented.
   ``We are all responsible for the situation in the world. For
years we (Czechoslovakia) have been doing nothing. We were a mere
passive colony,'' he commented.
   Zantovsky said Havel invited Arafat to visit Czechoslovakia, but
gave no date.
   The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, is due to visit
Czechoslovakia Feb. 2-6 at Havel's personal invitation, a move that
drew strong Chinese reaction.
   ``I have explained to the Chinese ambassador that the Dalai
Lama's visit to Czechoslovakia is of a private nature, I wanted to
invite him a long time ago when I was not yet a president,'' Havel
said. ``I want to meditate with him.''
   ``If the Chinese republic is not satisfied with this
explanation, I am sorry. The Dalai Lama is coming,'' Havel added.

   A Canadian Forces fighter jet that was
to intercept a U.S. cruise missile crashed shortly after takeoff on
Monday, military officials said.
   CBC-TV reported the single-seat CF-18 plane exploded in flight
and the pilot was killed. However, Maj. Jan Martinsen, spokesman
for the Cold Lake base, said the pilot's fate was unknown.
   The crash occurred near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, shortly
after the plane took off at 8:02 a.m., Martinsen said.
   The cruise flight was not affected and the cigar-shaped missile,
about the length of a full-size car, landed on schedule almost four
hours later on the Primrose Lake air weapons range surrounding Cold
Lake.
   It traveled 1,365 miles from the Beaufort Sea, over the
Mackenzie Valley, British Columbia and Alberta to Primrose,
Martinsen said.
   She said the cause of the CF-18 crash is not known. ``That's for
a board of inquiry to determine,'' she added.
   The Canadian Press identified the pilot as Capt. Richard Corver
of Toronto, quoting Martinsen as saying Corver had flown CF-18
fighter planes for three years.
   Searchers at the site found no sign of the pilot near the
fuselage, which was scattered over a snow-covered area 3 miles east
of the airport runway at Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories.
   ``This investigation will be very difficult because it's dark,
it's very cold and it's a very difficult area to reach,'' said
Martinsen. The only access to the area is by helicopter or
snowmobile.
   The CF-18 was part of the Canadian Forces team participating in
the 15th test of the cruise missile over Canada. The aircraft and
other planes were to hunt down and simulate shooting the missile.
   This was the first time a fighter plane had crashed in testing
of the cruise missile.
   The unarmed U.S. cruise missile was released from a B-52 bomber
over the Canadian Arctic.
   The test was the 15th over Canada's northwest since the Canadian
and U.S. governments signed an agreement in 1983. The CF-18s were
included in the military exercises for the first time last year.
   Residents of Inuvik said the crash area is dotted with lakes and
lightly wooded with spruce and pine trees. Temperatures in the area
hover around 30 degrees below zero.

   Back-to-back Super Bowl victories and a San
Francisco Bay area World Series provide bright but bittersweet
highlights for Northern Californians bowed under by a deadly
earthquake and string of ghastly crimes.
   Names in the news in the past year included a teamload of sports
stars and a busload of bad guys and alleged bad guys who share Page
One in local papers.
   While the San Francisco 49ers football team returned from New
Orleans on Monday after destroying the Denver Broncos 55-10, Mayor
Art Agnos awaited receipt of a dead fish. The Rocky Mountain trout
isn't a threat, it's the centerpiece of a dinner Agnos won in a
Super Bowl bet with the mayor of Denver.
   Led by quarterback Joe Montana, San Francisco took the Super
Bowl trophy home for the fourth time as the National Football
League's first repeat champion in a decade.
   The team made a triumphant return to the city Monday in a
downtown victory parade attended by 75,000 fans. Fans cheered ``Go
Niners!'' and sounded red plastic horns as Montana, coach George
Seifert, team owner Eddie DeBartolo and other players rode by in
flashy convertibles.
   The 49ers are being hailed as the ``team of the decades'' _ the
'80s and the '90s _ and the symbol of the region's resilience after
a year of disasters left it rattled but not ruined.
   ``It helped tremendously,'' Leo Bigley, 30, said of the 49ers
victory. ``The quake happened right during the football and
baseball seasons and took the spirit out of it. When the Niners
came back, it wasn't hysteria but all felt a commitment to this as
a way to show we can rebuild.''
   Or as San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse wrote, ``The
49ers once again showed kinky San Francisco that dominance can be
thrilling.''
   Not far from the parade route, crews worked to repair damage on
Marina Boulevard caused by the Oct. 17 earthquake that destroyed
stylish homes, sparked fires and knocked out utility service for
weeks.
   Thousands were left homeless and 67 people died in the 7.1
shudder centered in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three months later,
families still live in shelters from the farming community of
Watsonville to San Francisco.
   Alternative routes of transportation had to be found for those
attending the remaining World Series baseball games between the San
Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics in October. The quake struck
as Game 3 was about to begin at San Francisco's Candlestick Park.
The Athletics won the series, 4-0.
   Giants' pitcher Dave Dravecky became a hero without even
playing. Dravecky returned to baseball last year after surgery to
remove a malignant tumor from his left arm. After a dramatic
first-game-back victory, the weakened bone snapped as he won his
second post-operation start.
   Northern California children were the focus of other news in
1989.
   Last January a man clad in military fatigues and armed with an
Chinese assault rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other
students and one teacher when he opened fire at Cleveland
Elementary School in Stockton, 75 miles east of San Francisco. He
then shot and killed himself.
   Authorities said Patrick Purdy, 24, had acted out a hatred for
minorities and chose children because of their vulnerability.
   Children also were among the alleged victims of Ramon Salcido,
charged with the slayings of his wife, two daughters and four
others during a bloody rampage last April in the scenic wine
country north of San Francisco. A widespread manhunt ended with
Salcido's arrest in Mexico.
   Death also was the fate of former Black Panther leader Huey
Newton, shot in East Oakland in August by a man police say was
trying to win favor with a drug-dealing street gang.

   President Daniel Ortega Monday
promised to free more than 1,000 political and rebel prisoners
before next month's national elections.
   ``Tomorrow I will ask the National Assembly to release all these
prisoners,'' Ortega said.
   His announcement was widely seen as a move to upstage his main
opponent in the presidential race, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
candidate of the 14-party United National Opposition coalition, or
UNO.
   She has drawn enthusiastic responses at rallies for promising to
free all political prisoners if she wins the election, viewed as a
referendum on a decade of Sandinista rule.
   The Permanent Commission on Human Rights, a private Nicaraguan
organization, says there are currently more than 4,000 political
prisoners.
   Ortega announced his plans after meeting with Nicaragua's 11
Roman Catholic bishops, and he said he was releasing the prisoners
at the request of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of
Managua.
   ``We, as pastors, are interested in reconciliating men with God
and reconciliating men among each other,'' said Obando y Bravo, a
leading critic of Ortega's leftist Sandinista government. ``We are
happy, therefore, that we are advancing along these lines, creating
a climate of peace.''
   Ortega, who is seeking a second six-year term in the Feb. 25
elections, also urged the U.S.-supported Contra rebels to release
hundreds of people the government claims they have kidnapped.
   ``I think this would be a good time for those kidnapped to be
set free, because the mothers of those abducted suffer as much as
the mothers of those imprisoned,'' Ortega said.
   He said the political and rebel prisoners he has agreed to free
include 39 former members of the National Guard of dictator
Anastasio Somoza, who was overthrown by the Sandinistas in 1979,
and about 1,000 others imprisoned on charges of being Contras.
   The Sandinista-dominated National Assembly is expected to give
rubber-stamp approval to Ortega's request.
   Last March, the government released 1,984 former National
Guardsmen who had been jailed since the Sandinistas took power.
   The government kept 39 guardsmen it considered ``highly
dangerous'' in prison, a decision that has been the source of
repeated complaints by human rights groups and the men's families.
   Ortega, who has lately been courting the religious community,
also said he will speak with his brother, Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega, and Interior Minister Tomas Borge about allowing priests to
hold religious services at prisons and in military barracks.
   ``The idea is that the priests can go to the barracks and that
the soldiers and everyone else who would like to can receive
ministrations from the priests,'' Ortega said.

   The Bush administration has told Congress it
intends to sell Egypt some $488 million _ and Israel some $285
million _ in AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, missiles and support
equipment, the Pentagon announced on Monday.
   The Egyptian purchase includes 26 gunships, 492 Hellfire
missiles, other ammunition, spare equipment, training and support
services, the statement said.
   The Israeli purchase includes 19 gunships, 539 missiles, spare
and repair parts, training and other support services, the
statement said.
   The choppers are designed primarily as anti-tank weapons, and
are produced by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., Mesa, Ariz.
   The sales will not affect ``the basic military balance in the
region,'' the statement said.
   In a separate statement, the Pentagon said the administration
has also informed Congress it intends to sell Pakistan 10 AF-1F
Cobra attack helicopters including the TOW missile system at a cost
of $89 million.
   The sale also includes spare engines and logistics support, the
statement said.
   The choppers provide ``a modest increase in the Pakistan Army's
air mobile anti-tank capability,'' the statement said.
   The prime contractor is Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., of Fort
Worth, Texas.

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli and East German diplomats
began talks Monday on opening diplomatic relations, prevented for
40 years by the shadow of the Nazi Holocaust, said Amos Ganor, the
Israeli ambassador in Denmark.
   Neither side would say where the talks were being held in the
Danish capital or how long they would go on.
   Ganor said the talks touched on Israel's insistence that East
Germany accept part of the moral responsibility for the murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II, an issue that
blocked building of formal relations.
   ``But the talks are about more than just diplomatic relations
and reparations' for survivors of the Holocaust,'' Ganor said,
without elaborating.
   An East German spokesman, reading a brief statement following
the talks, said the meeting ``was conducted in a businesslike
atmosphere'' and would resume Tuesday.
   East Germany was the only Soviet bloc country not to establish
ties with Israel after the Jewish state gained its independence in
1948. All except Romania severed the ties after the 1967 Middle
East war.
   West Germany accepted blame for the Holocaust and paid billions
of dollars in reparations to Israel and to individual survivors.
   East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow said Friday that,
following the ouster of the previous Communist regime, his country
was ready to discuss relations with Israel and open up the issue of
reparations.
   Ganor said East Germany's movement toward democracy gave impetus
to the talks.
   Michael Shiloh headed the Israeli delegation and Reiner Neumann
represented East Germany. Both are Foreign Ministry officials.
   Hungary renewed ties with Israel last September. The Soviet
Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland have moved recently toward
repairing relations with Israel.

   Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ordered the
defense minister killed for opposing his order to shoot protesters
during last month's revolution, a top member of the deposed
Communist government told a military tribunal Monday.
   Emil Bobu's disclosure came as he, former Interior Minister
Tudor Postelnicu and Manea Manescu _ vice president of the State
Council under Ceausescu _ pleaded guilty to charges of complicity
to genocide.
   They face up to 30 years at hard labor if convicted in the first
of a series of trials of top Ceausescu henchmen.
   Ceausescu told an emergency Politburo meeting on Dec. 22 that
Defense Minister Vasile Milea was a traitor and had committed
suicide.
   Hours later, he and his wife fled Bucharest when the army sided
with protesters in the popular uprising.
   The Ceausescus were executed Christmas Day after they were
convicted at a secret military trial of genocide and ruining the
national economy. That tribunal also blamed the Ceausescus for
about about 60,000 deaths during the dictator's 24-year rule.
   Recalling the final Politburo meeting, Bobu said: ``My intimate
opinion is that the organization of the assassination of Gen. Milea
was made by the traitor Ceausescu.''
   Bobu said Ceausescu earlier had threatened to put Milea ``in
front of a firing squad'' because he tried to oppose an order to
shoot demonstrators in the western city of Timisoara, where the
revolution began Dec. 15.
   Milea was ``extremely outraged'' at the order, said Bobu, No. 3
in Ceausescu's government and the former secretary of the Communist
Party Central Committee.
   On Saturday, former Politburo member Ion Dinca, the fourth
person on trial, testified that Milea told Ceausescu on Dec. 17
that he had reviewed military regulations and ``didn't find
anywhere that the armed forces should shoot the people.''
   The testimony did not indicate who would have killed Milea.
   Dinca said Monday that he believed all four defendants agreed
with Ceausescu's orders to shoot because they wanted to save their
positions.
   Postelnicu denied he had control over the hated Securitate
secret police force, which he said was personally commanded by Mrs.
Ceausescu ``and partially by Ceausescu.''
   Postelnicu, speaking forcefully, said Ceausescu wanted to get
rid of him and Milea because the armed forces had not used tanks
and ammunition against the Timisoara demonstrators.
   He said four Politburo members opposed the dismissals, however,
and Ceausescu threatened to resign as leader of the government.
Bobu and several others then insisted Ceausescu stay, Postelnicu
said.
   Asked by the tribunal president, Col. Andrei Nitoiu, whether
that was a moment that could have ended Ceausescu's dictatorship,
Postelnicu replied:
   ``I think this could have been the unique moment in the last 20
years. In my five years as a non-voting member of the Politburo,
this was the first time that anyone contradicted him. ... I could
have done it, but I didn't do it.''
   Nitoiu read off the inventory of goods found at Postelnicu's
home, including 22 pounds of jewels, $27,500 in Romanian currency,
extensive video equipment and 440 pounds of meat, which was
severely rationed by Ceausescu's government.
   Nitoiu said investigators found more than $444,500 in Romanian's
lei currency at Manescu's home, along with gold and jewelry.

   Fuel shortages like the one that may have
occured before last week's Avianca crash are not routinely given
emergency treatment unless the pilot actually declares a ``fuel
emergency,'' under federal rules for air traffic controllers.
   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Monday that it is not the responsibility of
the controllers to relay information other than the flight's route
and number unless the pilot specifically calls an emergency.
   ``Air traffic controllers have have one primary job _ to keep
aircraft from getting too close,'' Farrar said. ``It's the
captain's job to fly the airplane. It's not the controllers' job to
make judgments for him.''
   However, FAA investigators said the regional controllers did
relay information, by telephone, to the control center that handles
approaches and departures at Kennedy International Airport, but the
urgency of the matter wasn't clear.
   That conflicts with information provided Sunday night by the
National Transportation Safety Board, which said the regional
controllers had not relayed word of the fuel shortage to the local
controllers.
   The regional controller said Avianca 52 had just come out of the
holding area ``and can only do five more minutes of hold. Can you
take him now?''
   The local control replied, ``Slow him to 180 knots and I will
take him.''
   Under standards set by the FAA, if a pilot tells air traffic
controllers he has ``minimum fuel,'' both he and controllers know
that no undue delay can be accepted.
   But according to the FAA`s air traffic control manual, ``this is
not an emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an
emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.''
   A minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for the aircraft
to be given a traffic priority, the FAA rules state.
   But if the pilot takes the next step and declares a fuel
emergency, the entire controller system is geared to help.
   The FAA manual puts it this way:
   ``If at any time, the remaining useable fuel supply suggests the
need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot
should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes.''
   As he circled over the seaboard in holding patterns before
crashing on Long Island, the captain of Avianca Flight 52 never
declared he had an actual fuel emergency.
   The crash killed 73 people and injured 85 others.
   On Sunday, Lee Dickinson of the National Transportation Safety
Board told a news conference in Melville, N.Y., there was an
apparent communications gap between high-altitude regional
controllers and those handling landings.
   As the plane neared the end of its final, 46-minute holding
pattern south of Kennedy International Airport, the crew told
controllers in the regional New York Center about the fuel shortage
and requested priority clearance to land, Dickinson said.
   Shortly afterward, the regional controllers turned the aircraft
over to the local controllers. But, after interviewing six local
controllers who either handled or tracked the flight, investigators
determined they were unaware of the shortage, Dickinson said.
   R. Steve Bell, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, AFL-CIO, called the safety board's assrtions ``highly
misleading and premature.''
   The Avianca pilot never declared a ``fuel emergency,'' he said.
   ``No one knew how perilous was his situation until it was far
too late,'' Bell said. ``The air traffic controllers would have
moved heaven and earth to make for a safe approach for the crippled
aircraft but the pilot never sent out the key words that he was in
mortal danger.''

   Erich Honecker, who ruled East Germany for 18
years until his downfall in October, was arrested immediately after
his release from a hospital Monday and will be tried for treason,
the national prosecutor said.
   Plans to put the former Communist Party chief and three members
of his Politburo on trial in March were announced by Prosecutor
Hans-Juergen Joseph at a session of Parliament, where Premier Hans
Modrow offered a grim account of the state of the nation.
   The swift action against Honecker, 77, indicates the strength of
a nationwide backlash against corruption in his Stalinist regime.
   Economic problems and widespread unrest have forced Modrow, the
embattled Communist premier, to move the country's first free
elections up from May to March 18 and bring the opposition into a
coalition that will govern until then.
   In Washington, State Department Richard Boucher said: ``They
seem to have accelerated the schedule in order to move quickly to a
more stable, more long-term regime that's based on the popular
will. That's something that we support.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass later announced that Modrow had
arrived on a 24-hour working visit in Moscow at the Kremlin's
invitation and noted it was his first trip there since being
elected prime minister last November.
   Tass said Modrow is expected to meet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and to have talks on a
wide range of subjects, including the processes under way in the
two countries and Eastern Europe.
   More than 100,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig and other
cities Monday night. Many called for the election defeat of the
Communists and reunification with prosperous West Germany.
   ADN, the official news agency, said Communist Party chief Gregor
Gysi postponed a trip to the United States planned for this week so
he could help prepare for the elections.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said in Bonn he would
campaign for any East German Christian conservatives who wanted his
help, and put off a visit Chile and Brazil planned for early March.
   He said negotiations on an agreement to strengthen ties between
the two Germanys should be conducted with the government chosen in
March.
   Honecker had recuperated at Charite hospital from the surgical
removal Jan. 8 of a malignant kidney tumor. He was arrested as he
left the hospital and taken to Rummelsburg prison in East Berlin,
ADN reported.
   It said Dr. Peter Althaus, director of the hospital's urology
clinic, considered Honecker too ill to be imprisoned.
   Bild, a mass-circulation West German newspaper published in
Hamburg, reported last week that Honecker would be arrested and
kept at a prison medical facility. ADN did not say whether
Rummelsburg had a hospital.
   A dozen once-mighty Politburo members have been swept up in the
anti-corruption campaign. In Parliament, Joseph said 23 officials
from the former government were in jail.
   Honecker, ousted Oct. 18, is accused of leading the nation to
the brink of economic collapse through mismanagement and the misuse
of power for personal enrichment.
   Joseph said Erich Mielke, Guenter Mittag and Joachim Herrmann,
former Politburo members, also faced trial for treason.
   Mielke was Honecker's security chief, Mittag oversaw the economy
and Hermann was in charge of propaganda.
   Treason previously carried a maximum penalty of death, but East
Germany abolished capital punishment last year.
   Modrow's speech to Parliament explaining the decision to hold
earlier elections and govern with the opposition painted a bleak
picture of conditions in East Germany.
   He said mounting challenges to authority threatened the
government's existence.
   ``The current government coalition is proving increasingly
fragile,'' Modrow said. ``Economic and social tensions have
increased. The economic sitution is deteriorating in a worrying
way.''
   Strikes, work slowdowns and the flight to the west of up to
2,500 people a day have worsened the already stagnant economy, and
demands for higher wages and benefits are ``threatening the
existence of East Germany,'' he declared.
   ``These failures have had a chain reaction of consequences for
many other facilities and for provision and care of the
population.''
   New wage demands would cost East Germany $23.5 billion, and the
budget already is $10 billion in the red, he said.
   Bomb threats, unruly demonstrations and vandalism have increased
and the government no longer is able to ensure public safety,
Modrow told the lawmakers.
   ``The emigration wave continues unhindered,'' Modrow said. More
than 340,000 East Germans left in 1989, most of them skilled
workers.
   Under a coalition plan agreed upon Sunday, each of the nine
reform groups participating in weekly meetings with the Communists
will name a minister without portfolio to join Modrow's 27-member
Cabinet.
   The new Cabinet is to be announced Wednesday.
   At its Monday session, Parliament approved the March 18 election
date and gave the first reading to a law establishing democratic
voting procedures.
   In the weekly meeting with the opposition, where reforms are
drafted, Environment Minister Peter Diederich gave a depressing
report on the ecology.
   He said East Germans breathe air contaminated by four times the
volume of pollutants emitted in West Germany, which has its own
smog problems.
   More than 44 percent of the forests are dead or dying and at
least 10 percent of the people drink water that does not meet
public health standards, he said.
   Sulfur dioxide emissions are nearly nine times higher those in
West Germany and considerably worse than in Czechoslovakia and
Poland, which along with East Germany are the most polluted nations
in Europe, Diederich said.
   The minister said he would press the government to give the
environment equal rank with economic performance.

   Pope John Paul II on Monday
exhorted developed nations to help poor African countries by
treating them as equals and sharing the resources and knowledge
needed to escape poverty.
   ``How would history judge a generation that, having all the
means to feed the Earth's population, refused to do so in
fratricidal indifference?'' the pope asked in what the Vatican
described as the major speech of his five-country African trip.
   This sub-Saharan country, whose name means Land of the Upright
Men, symbolizes the chronic problems of drought, hunger, disease,
and expanding deserts that afflict much of the continent. The
average per capita income in Burkina Faso is about $200 a year.
   ``I must point out the gravity of the ills that wound the
peoples of Africa so much,'' the pope said in a speech at the
headquarters of the West African Economic Community.
   ``If we want to help Africa overcome its handicaps, a public
awakening is needed more than ever,'' he said.
   The pope spoke at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of an
appeal he made on behalf of the sub-Sahara region, or Sahel, during
his first visit to Ouagadougou.
   That appeal led to the creation in 1984 of the John Paul II
Foundation for the Sahel, funded primarily by West German
Catholics. The organization has invested more than $3 billion to
combat desertification and finance health, agriculture and other
development projects.
   But the Sahel, and all of Africa, still needs help, John Paul
said.
   ``Once again, I must launch a solemn appeal to humanity, in the
name of humanity itself ... in the name of justice, I beg my
brothers and sisters in humanity not to scorn the starving of this
continent, not to deny them the universal right to human dignity
and the security of life,'' he said.
   ``The world must know that Africa suffers deep poverty,'' he
said, speaking in French. ``Available resources are declining, the
Earth is becoming sterile over immense areas, malnutrition is
chronic for 10 of millions of humans, death claims too many
children. Can not such destitution be considered a wound in the
side of all of humanity?''
   John Paul said developed nations must view poor nations as
partners and share scientific knowledge to help promote progress.
   ``They should not see the poorest countries only as clients or
more or less solvent debtors,'' he said. ``This attitude, conscious
or not, has led to too many dead ends.''
   He also emphasized the responsibility of public officials in the
needy natons.
   ``It is the moral quality of the people which must be respected,
and all forms of intolerance, corruption, resentment and debasement
must be abolished,'' he said.
   Earlier, the pope told Roman Catholics to build a society in
Burkina Faso ``based on respect of the human person and the
family.''
   ``Human life is inviolable,'' he said at Mass at a national
pilgrimage site outside the capital. ``The right to life should be
defended ceaselessly'' from conception to natural death.
   John Paul said couples must resist ``invasion of methods which
go against the dignity of the woman and don't honor man.''
   The local church has resisted the government's birth control
programs, and there is similar opposition from Moslems. A survey
last year found only 4 percent to 6 percent of women using modern
birth control methods.
   The birthrate in this country of 8.5 million people is 2.9
percent, one of the highest in the world. Catholics make up about 9
percent of the population.
   International aid agencies, including the World Bank, and
African governments themselves, have identified population growth
as a key factor in the poverty that afflicts the Sahel.
   The pope's African tour began Jan. 25. He returns to Rome on
Thursday after a stop in Chad. The pope has also visited Cape
Verde, Guinea Bissau and Mali.

   The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 victory over the
Denver Broncos on Sunday would be one of the lowest-rated Super
Bowls in history if overnight ratings released Monday are an
indication.
   The game averaged a 39.6 rating in 23 cities, and the ratings
dropped during the game as it became clear the 49ers had the
National Football League championship in the bag, according to the
figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Michael Eisenberg, a CBS vice president for research, said his
network anticipated the ratings to rise to 40.0 when national
ratings are released Tuesday. Each national ratings point now
represents 921,000 homes.
   If the national ratings don't appreciably rise from the
overnight figures, Sunday's game would be the lowest-rated Super
Bowl since 1971, when Baltimore's victory over Dallas got a 39.9
rating.
   The rating represents the percentage of televisions tuned in to
a program. Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by
the 49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in nearly 40
million homes, according to Nielsen estimates.
   The ratings for this year's game dropped off during the second
half as San Francisco's margin of victory increased.
   From 7 p.m. EST to 7:30, the game got a 37.0 rating. It dropped
to 37.3 rating from 7:30 to 8, to 34.8 from 8 to 8:30 and 32.0 for
the final half hour, which included postgame interviews.

   Western European governments reacted calmly Monday
to plans announced in Washington to shut seven U.S. military bases
in Europe, but at one base due to be closed, British anti-nuclear
protesters expressed delight.
   Women who have maintained ``peace camps'' for nearly a decade
around the muddy perimeter at Greenham Common said they helped send
the Americans home.
   The U.S. cruise nuclear missile base, west of London, is
probably the best-known of the bases slated for closure.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev
said of the proposed 2 percent cut in the U.S. defense budget,
``Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have agreed the cold war is over.
Any vestige of that should be relegated to history.''
   In Italy, where the U.S. cruise missile base at Comiso is
scheduled to close, Premier Giulio Andreotti's spokesman, Pio
Mastrobuoni, declared, ``The announcement is a sign of the times.
   ``The news expresses the new reality of the climate of
cooperation between East and West.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a firm opponent of any
significant disarmament by the West despite the crumbling of
communist governments in the East bloc, had ``no objections,'' said
a spokeswoman at her 10 Downing St. office.
   ``We've discussed the proposals with the United States. We have
no objections,'' the spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Greek Parliament was due to vote Monday on a six-month
extension of the 1983 agreement covering U.S. bases, but postponed
the vote for two days.
   Instead, Defense Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis announced two of
the four major military installations in Greece are to go _
Hellinikon base outside Athens, used by reconnaissance aircraft
that shadow the Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean, and Nea Makri, a
U.S. naval communications base 22 miles from the capital.
   The bases are among 14 U.S. foreign military installations and
more than 60 in the United States that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney announced he wants to close or realign to save money.
   Community leaders and business people in several areas near
bases expressed concern at what will amount to losses of millions
of dollars annually.
   Besides Greenham Common, two other of the 66 U.S. military
installations in Britain were being closed _ Fairford, a base for
18 KC-135 air-to-air refuelling tankers in south-central England,
25 miles from Oxford, and Wethersfield, eastern England, base for a
civil engineering unit.
   The other proposed base closures in European NATO countries were
two in Turkey _ Eskisehir Munitions Storage Site and Erhac Air Base
_ and one in West Germany, Zweibrucken Air Base.
   In addition, the British Defense Ministry said a squadron of
American F-16 fighters based at Bentwaters in eastern England was
to be disbanded.
   ``We have to make our operations cost just a little bit less. .
.. We feel this is the way to do it in the United Kingdom,'' said
Lt. Col. Sam Giammo, director of public affairs for the 3rd U.S.
Air Force, based at Mildenhall, in the eastern England county of
Norfolk.
   Jean Hutchison, 54, a longtime member of a ramshackle camp on
the Greenham Common base perimeter, said, ``The Americans will
leave Greenham rather than other bases thanks to the work of
thousands of women.''
   Said Evelyn Parker, another Greenahm anti-nuclear campaigner,
``It's stunning news. This has been an amazing thing to live
through.''
   Missiles are being removed from Greenham, Comiso and other U.S.
cruise and Pershing II nuclear missile bases under the 1987
agreement between the superpowers to eliminate their medium-range
nuclear missiles.
   Giammo said Greenham Common and Fairford will be put on a
standby basis. He said the United States will maintain a small
presence at each site in case it needed to reactivate the base. The
last cruise missiles are to be removed from Greenham Common next
year. Wethersfield will be handed back to Britain's Royal Air Force.
   About 3,000 American personnel will be withdrawn from Britain,
or about 7.5 percent of the total, under the proposals announced
Monday, he added.
   U.S. officials in Seoul quickly reassured South Koreans Tuesday
that closure of three U.S. air bases in Taegu, Kwangju and Suwon
and cutback of 2,000 personnel would not affect America's
commitment to maintain peace on the divided Korean peninsula that
it shares with North Korea.
   ``These changes are in response to budgetary realities and do
not signal a lessening in the United States commitment to the
Republic of Korea,'' said a statement issued by Brig Gen. Jimmy L.
Cash, vice commander of the 7th U.S. Air Force based in South
Korea..
   Newspapers there made Cheney's announcement a banner story
Tuesday and Korean Broadcasting quoted the South Korean Defense
Ministry as reminding citizens that the combined war capability of
the U.S. and South Korean forces would be little affected.

<HEAD>Three Children Wounded by Green Line Snipers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children were wounded Monday when
the car carrying them to school was struck by sniper fire as
Christians and Moslems battled across Beirut's dividing Green Line,
police said.
   In southern Lebanon, security sources said Norwegians serving as
U.N. peacekeepers went on alert following threats by militiamen of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army to ``kill all the Norwegians
in the area.''
   Police in Beirut said the children, two brothers ages 3 and 10
and a 4-year-old boy, were shot in the predominantly Shiite Moslem
suburb of Rweiss in south Beirut.
   All were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.
   The fighting erupted Sunday along the three-mile demarcation
line that splits Beirut into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital through
the night as Christian army units and Syrian-backed Moslem
militiamen battled with tanks and artillery, but the fighting died
down Monday morning.
   Monday's victims raised the casualty toll from Green Line
fighting this year to four killed and 15 wounded.
   The hostilities violated a Sept. 22 cease-fire brokered by the
Arab League that halted six months of murderous artillery battles
between troops commanded by maverick Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun and the Syrian army.
   More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded in
that round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Meanwhile, a security source in the town of Tyre said four
members of the South Lebanon Army told Norwegian soldiers manning a
checkpoint in the village of Ibl el-Saqi, ``We shall kill all the
Norwegians in this area.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
680-man Norwegian battalion went on alert and sent reinforcements
to the checkpoint, which is inside the zone Israel controls.
   The Norwegians are part of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, which refused to comment on the incident.
   According to U.N. records, 167 peacekeepers have been killed, 18
of them Norwegians, since the observers deployed in south Lebanon
in March 1978. About 70 percent were killed in action, the rest in
traffic accidents and similar incidents.
   There has been frequent tension between the U.N. peacekeepers
and the South Lebanon Army since Israel retained the border zone in
1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its army three years after
invading Lebanon.
   The 5,800-strong U.N. force, drawn from nine nations, mans a
narrow buffer separating the zone from predominantly Shiite Moslem
areas.
   The Norwegian battalion's area of operations overlaps with some
sections of the six-to-10 mile border zone controlled by 1,500
Israeli troops and the South Lebanon Army. The force is mostly
Christian militia of 3,500 men who are armed, trained and funded by
Israel.
   Also in southern Lebanon, police said a cease-fire was holding
between rival Shiite Moslem factions that have been fighting for
the last month.
   The truce between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, was called Sunday by
Algerian mediator Mohammed Taher.
   By police count, 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded in
the battles between the two groups.
   They have been fighting intermittently since May 1987 for
control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.

   The Pentagon's proposal Monday to shut down or trim dozens of
U.S. military installations has government and business officials
in affected cities worried about their economies and promising a
fight, especially in California.
   Ten California bases with about 35,000 soldiers and 22,000
civilian workers are among the more than 72 installations
recommended for closure or reduction by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who also proposed ending operations at 12 military
facilities overseas to save money.
   Government officials in the San Francisco Bay area, where
several facilities would be affected, expressed dismay over the
recommendation that came as part of Cheney's $292.1 billion
spending plan for fiscal 1991.
   ``This is really a terrible thing to hear and we're not going to
lay back and let it happen. We're going to fight like the dickens
to keep this base open,'' said Alameda, Calif., Mayor Chuck Corica,
referring to the Alameda Naval Air Station that Cheney targeted as
a candidate for closure.
   Corica's city of 77,000 people just across the bay from San
Francisco is home to 8,300 soldiers and 5,100 civilians employed at
the air station, which has an annual payroll of $340 million.
   ``They've been here for more than 50 years,'' Corica said of the
Navy. ``We consider them part of our family.''
   Corica said he will join with members of California's
congressional delegation, other mayors in Alameda County,
businesses and the facility's civilian workers to urge Congress to
keep open the air station, which is the home port of the nuclear
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and three guided-missile cruisers.
   Also on the list of candidates for closure is the Long Beach
Naval Shipyard in Southern California.
   ``Naturally, we oppose it. Naturally, we'll do whatever we can
to make sure that it doesn't become reality,'' said Long Beach
Assistant City Manager John Shirey.
   The shipyard is one of the port city's largest employers and
closing it could take up to $100 million a year out of the local
economy, said Bob Creighton, president of the Long Beach Area
Chamber of Commerce.
   ``The closing of the shipyard would have a ripple effect, not
only with the companies and industries doing business with the
shipyard but also with businesses throughout the city,'' he said.
   The shipyard employs 4,700 civilians and 300 military personnel.
   The largest possible California candidate for closure is the
Army's Fort Ord near Monterey, home of the Army's 7th Light
Infantry Division, which played a key role in the recent U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   The base about 120 miles south of San Francisco has 15,000
soldiers and 3,000 civilian employees, with an annual payroll of
$732 million and an estimated impact on the local economy of more
than $885 million a year.
   Two California installations on the list for study are in
Oakland. The Naval Supply Center, which provides support for the
U.S. Pacific Fleet, employs 61 servicemen and 1,700 civilians with
a $42 million payroll, and the Oakland Naval Hospital, which has
1,600 military and civilian workers with a payroll of $66 million.
   Oakland City Manager Henry Gardner estimated that 2,000 of the
city's 360,000 residents were employed at the two installations.
   Pledges to fight the Pentagon recommendations, which must be
approved by Congress, also came over bases targeted elsewhere in
the United States, including Pennsylvania and Alabama.
   Pennsylvania's two U.S. senators, Republicans Arlen Specter and
John Heinz, talked with reporters Monday outside the Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard, which Cheney recommended for closure.
   ``It won't happen,'' Specter said.
   The shipyard employs about 8,600 people.
   In Alabama, Cheney proposed closing the Army's Fort McClellan in
Anniston. The base employs 2,700 military personnel and 1,500
civilians.
   Alabama's two U.S. senators, Democrats Howell Heflin and Richard
Shelby, and U.S. Rep. Glen Browder, a Democrat who represents the
Fort McClellan area, held a news conference in Oxford to assure
several hundred community leaders that they would fight the
proposed closing.
   ``If they are looking for a political fight, they've come to the
right place. We're ready,'' Browder said.

<HEAD>Turkey Says Greece Doesn't Protect Minority Turks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey accused Greek authorities on Monday
of failing to take effective action to stop attacks against the
Turkish Moslem minority in the northeastern town of Komotini.
   ``The Greek police and authorities remained spectators when our
ethnic brothers and their property were attacked,'' a Foreign
Ministry statement said.
   Turkey maintains that the 120,000-strong minority in Greece is
both Turkish and Moslem. Greece recognizes only their religious
identity.
   The ministry summoned Greek envoy Dimitris Makris on Monday and
told him Turkey expects security measures to stop the attacks.
   It also said Turkey demanded that compensation be paid for
Turkish minority shops that were ``destroyed and looted.''
   Greece must take steps to tackle ``serious problems in western
Thrace'' to prevent ``serious injuries to our relations which will
be very difficult to set straight,'' the ministry statement said.
   It accused Komotini radio stations of calling on Christian
Greeks to prevent and to protest a special Moslem ceremony at the
mosque.
   Greek police said Christians and Moslems clashed when Moslems
demonstrated to protest the imprisonment of two prominent members
of their community.
   Christians were said to be enraged by the reported death of a
Christian as a result of an attack by a Moslem following an
argument over the court case.
   Last Friday a Komotini court sentenced Ahmet Sadik, a physician
and politician, and, Ibrahim Sherif, another local politician, to
18 months each in prison for spreading ``dissension and hostility''
between the two communities. The ministry statement Monday said the
court case and attacks were ``evidence that human rights are being
gravely violated in western Thrace.''
   In a statement to Turkish TV Monday, Premier Yildirim Akbulut
called the verdict ``a legal mistake'' and demanded ``an immediate
stop to incidents in Komotini.''
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that Ismail
Rodoplu, a member of Parliament from the region and a Moslem, had
taken refuge in a lawyer's office and was unable to leave for fear
of his safety.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday sent Congress a $1.23
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below
inflation and recognizes ``remarkable changes'' in the world by
scaling back defense and rewarding emerging democracies.
   Bush called the spending plan an ``investment in the future,''
but Democrats in Congress pounced on it as not bold enough on
defense cuts and too harsh on social programs. They also disputed
the president's contention that his budget would halve the deficit,
to $63.1 billion, saying its economic assumptions were too
optimistic.
   ``This is a take-two-aspirin and call-me-in-the-morning
budget,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee, which opens hearings on the new budget on Tuesday.
   Fights loomed with the Democratic-controlled Congress on a range
of fronts: Bush's desire to cut Medicare and capital gains taxes,
to close military bases he considers outmoded and, on the other
hand, to preserve some expensive weapons.
   Bush would increase spending on space, education, the
environment and the war on drugs. Losers, this year, are Medicare,
college student loans, farm subsidies, energy conservation and mass
transit.
   The president's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
calls for $36.5 billion in spending cuts and other
deficit-reduction measures.
   It projects a 7 percent increase in revenues, to $1.17 trillion,
without a general tax increase and just a 3 percent boost in
overall spending - more than a percentage point below the current
rate of inflation.
   Bush proposed defense spending of $292.1 billion, a cut of 2
percent measured against inflation; while boosting foreign aid to
Eastern Europe, the Philippines and Latin America.
   On the domestic front, his budget would leave in place the
Social Security tax increase that took effect earlier this month.
But it honors Bush's 1988 campaign pledge to propose no general tax
increase.
   Still, the budget recommends $15.6 billion in lesser tax
increases and a $5.6 billion increase in user and service fees _
most of them recycled from Reagan budgets and previously defeated
in Congress.
   The budget calls for ``family savings'' accounts under which
families could bank up to $5,000 a year and pay no tax on interest
on deposits held for seven or more years.
   ``With an eye toward future growth, and expansion of the human
frontier, the budget's chief emphasis is on investment in the
future,'' Bush said in a brief message to Congress accompanying the
1,569-page document.
   But Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., called it a document of ``low
aspirations. ... It predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then
goes on to propose no change in course.''
   And House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``I
think it's a standpat budget'' but he said lawmakers would ``take
it very seriously'' rather than pronouncing it ``dead on arrival''
as Democrats had done with several Reagan budgets.
   Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, opened the annual
budget battle by proposing a truce. ``We fully expect to negotiate
with Congress over priorities,'' he told a briefing.
   But Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said that getting a budget agreement this
year would be tough. ``It's not child's play,'' he said.
   And House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said ``obviously
the (Democratic) majority has a little bit different idea of where
the priorities ought to be...Hopefully, we'll just get it done on
time.''
   Bush's budget asserted it was meeting the $64 billion deficit
target for fiscal 1991, under the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing
law, ``with specific and defensible measures _ and without
gimmicks.''
   However, critics claimed the administration's prescription for
getting the budget deficit down to $63.1 billion _ from a projected
$123.8 billion this year _ does rely on accounting gimmicks.
   ``They continue to jimmy the figures,'' said Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C. ``It's another fraud.''
   For one thing, Bush's budget uses an optimistic set of economic
projections that assume both declining interest rates and falling
inflation. The budget also calls for overall growth this year of
2.4 percent this year _ compared to the 1.7 percent forecast by
private forecasters and the Congressional Budget Office.
   The government's most recent figures showed economic growth
slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent during the last three
months of 1989.
   ``Obviously, the slowdown in the fourth quarter makes everybody
nervous,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady conceded.
   Bush recycled many proposals which did not reach enactment in
1989 _ a tightening of the Clean Air Act, a reduction in the
capital gains tax rate, a $3,000 tax credit for adoptions, tax
breaks for child care and more money for fighting crime and drugs.
   The most dramatic element of the budget was the scaleback in
defense.
   Propelled by relaxed East-West tensions, the Pentagon budget
calls for a reduction of 38,000 troops and closing dozens of
military bases. It was the most restrained defense budget from the
White House in more than a decade.
   ``Remarkable changes have occurred during the past year. The
Berlin Wall has been opened and democratic forces are on the move
in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said. ``As a result, savings in the
defense budget are now possible.''
   Bush said defense and international policy ``must take advantage
of the opportunities provided'' by these changes.
   However, claiming Soviet military capability ``will remain
formidable, even after announced reductions,'' Bush said he was
proposing a military budget that would allow the nation ``to hedge
against an uncertain future.''
   His plan calls for five costly new B-2 stealth bombers, another
$1 billion Trident submarine and funds for two controversial
intercontinental nuclear missile systems. He also called for an
additional $900 million for the Strategic Defense Initiative, known
as Star Wars.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said defense spending
will be a crucial battleground and predicted Congress would make
``larger reducitons'' that Bush proposed.
   The president's budget calls for a $3 billion increase in
outlays for foreign aid, to $14.2 billion. It calls for $300
million in special assistance ``for those countries in Eastern
Europe that are moving toward democracy'' and another $200 million
for the Philippines.
   It also requests $270 million in outlays for the Andean
countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to help stem the
international flow of drugs.
   The administration renewed its call for a lower capital gains
tax, proposing that 30 percent of assets held for more than three
years be exempt. The measure was similar to one blocked in the
Senate last year that would have lowered the effective rate of the
tax to 19.6 percent.
   Currently, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other
income _ 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent.
   The administration did not embrace a proposal by Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to provide a $62 billion cut in Social Security
taxes this year and next. However, it proposed that after 1993 _
when the budget is supposed to be balanced under Gramm-Rudman _ any
Social Security surpluses be used to pay off the national debt.
   As in past budgets, the Social Security surplus masked the size
of the deficit. The 1991 deficit would be $70 billion higher
without this surplus.
   The various domestic cuts totalled $13.9 billion, with $5.5
billion coming from trims in doctor and hospitals payments under
Medicare.
   Other major program cuts included $1.8 billion in farm price
supports and crop insurance and savings of $2.9 billion by limiting
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining
cost of living increases to civilian and military government
workers. Low-income energy assistance would be trimmed by $340
million, to less than $1.1 billion.

   An attorney for Manuel Noriega said Monday he hopes
to get a ruling this week on a request that the ousted Panamanian
dictator be declared a prisoner of war and moved to a neutral
country.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler scheduled a status
conference for Thursday on the drug trafficking case against the
dictator overthrown during the U.S. invasion of Panama last month.
   Hoeveler also heard arguments on requests that two co-defendants
be released on bond, but delayed until Thursday a decision on Lt.
Col. Luis del Cid, 46, and Daniel Miranda, 36.
   Noriega's attorneys stunned a packed federal courtroom Friday by
asking that their client be declared a POW and moved to a neutral
third country because he was captured during an armed invasion.
   Noriega was moved Sunday night from a special holding cell in
the federal courthouse in Miami to a federal prison about 20 miles
south of the city on Sunday night. The federal Metropolitican
Correctional Center is a medium-security facility, but contains
some maximum-security cells.
   Noriega, who wore civilian clothing as he was taken to the
prison, reportedly will be kept separate from other prisoners, said
Jim Jones, a regional spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin on Monday reiterated that the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center is not the proper place
for a prisoner of war.
   The defense's legal argument has been given little chance of
success because courts have consistently upheld the government's
right to prosecute foreign defendants no matter how they were
brought to the jurisdiction.
   But Kollin said he's not concerned about critics of the defense
strategy. ``We're not worrying about what other lawyers say; our
concern is with the judge,'' he said.
   Kollin said he expects Noriega will be in the courtroom Thursday
for a discussion of pending motions and the setting of a more
realistic trial date.
   Hoeveler earlier this month set a trial date of March 5, but
said at the time he didn't expect that date to hold up.
   Kollin said he expects a ruling on several defense motions.
``We're hopeful we'll get a ruling from the judge on our motion
that General Noriega will have status of prisoner of war,'' he
added.

   An air force pilot test flew a Soviet-made
MiG-23 fighter jet on Monday in its first flight since a Syrian
pilot defected to Israel in it last October.
   The Israeli flew the jet for about 50 minutes and performed a
series of maneuvers, including a flyover of Jerusalem. An F-15 and
an F-16, both U.S.-made fighter jets, escorted the MiG-23.
   ``We are investigating the systems to see what they do and see
how we can work against them,'' the pilot told reporters later.
``It means a lot to us.''
   His name could not be disclosed under briefing rules.
   He said the Syrian pilot, Maj. Mohammed Bassam Adel, instructed
him on operating the aircraft. Adel, 34, flew it to Israel on Oct.
11, saying he sought freedom.
   When the jet was put on display Monday, it carried its original
camouflage colors. The Syrian flag remained on its tail, but a
blue-and-white Star of David was painted on its fuselage.
   A senior air force officer said the jet was the only one of its
class in the West. He indicated that information gleaned from the
test could be exchanged with friendly nations.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
American experts from the Pentagon, U.S. Air Force and intelligence
agencies recently visited Israel to inspect the MiG-23.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber refused to comment on any
such visit.

   The San Francisco 49ers, fresh from their
55-10 Super Bowl slaughter of the Denver Broncos, made a triumphant
return Monday in a huge victory parade through the heart of an
adoring city.
   Cheers of ``Go Niners!'' were drowned out by the blaring of
thousands of red plastic horns as 75,000 fans paid tribute to
quarterback Joe Montana, coach George Seifert, team owner Eddie
DeBartolo and other players riding in flashy convertibles.
   Office workers leaned out of windows to watch, and some sent
showers of paper down on the parade, which began near the
waterfront and continued for about a mile along Market Street.
   Fans, many sporting the team colors of red and gold, arrived up
to two hours early to claim spots in front or perches on lamp posts
or newspaper racks.
   ``There's no team in the NFL that can beat us,'' said Wayne
Rayburn of Sausalito, wearing a pair of 49ers boxer shorts over his
jeans to complement his official National Footbal League team
jacket.
   ``If I wore them under my jeans you wouldn't be able to see
them,'' he said.
   Rayburn, crouching on a concrete garbage can, vowed to claim the
same spot and wear the same shorts again at next year's Super Bowl
victory parade. Like other fans, he predicted the 49ers would win
an unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship.
   ``Threepeat next year!'' he said.
   The parade followed the 49ers' easy win Sunday over the Broncos
in New Orleans. It was San Francisco's fourth Super Bowl victory in
nine years and the second in a row.
   The 55-10 score was the largest margin in 24 Super Bowls, but
some fans who expected an easy Niners victory regretted the score
wasn't even more lopsided.
   ``I wish we could have had at least 75 points,'' Rayburn said.
   Domonic Johnson of Walnut Creek begrudged Denver anything on the
scoreboard.
   ``I predicted the game at 55-0, but they did score those
points,'' Johnson said while waiting for the parade. ``I guess it
did keep it from getting too boring for some people.''
   Fans waved banners, clutched red and gold balloons and held
small children high for a clear view of the parade led by
DeBartolo, Mayor Art Agnos and Seifert, who displayed the gold
Super Bowl trophy to the roaring crowd.
   They were followed by Montana, who passed for five touchdowns
and earned his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award. The
quarterback and his wife, Jennifer, waved as they rode with their
three small children in the back of a red convertible.

   The worlds of music, dance and theater came
together Monday night for a performance to raise money for the
Spoleto arts festival in historic Charleston, S.C., which was
battered by Hurricane Hugo last year.
   The event at Lincoln Center, with actress Lynn Redgrave as host,
raised about $350,000 for Spoleto Festival USA, an annual 17-day
celebration of the arts.
   Hurricane Hugo did an estimated $4 million in damage to
festival-related buildings and equipment when the killer storm
raged through the area last September.
   Choreographer Jerome Robbins introduced New York City Ballet
dancers who performed a number from his ballet, ``The Goldberg
Variations.''
   Two members of the Martha Graham Dance Company performed
``Errand into the Maze'' and sopranos Renee Fleming and Young Ok
Shin performed selections from Mozart's ``Le Nozze di Figaro.''
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the hurricane had made
things extremely difficult for the festival and the city's arts
agencies, but promised that when patrons return to this year's
festival, ``the great beauty of our city will abound again.''
   Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti began the
arts festival in the city of Spoleto, Italy, in 1957 in hopes of
merging European and American cultures. He launched the U.S.
version in Charleston in 1977, and the festival continues in each
city annually.
   This year's Charleston festival runs from May 25 through June 10.

   Regional air controllers knew a Colombian
jetliner was low on fuel and needed priority landing clearance 50
minutes before it crashed, but local controllers never got the
information, investigators said.
   The investigation into Avianca Flight 52's crash, which killed
73 people and injured 85, is focusing on the communication gap
between the high-altitude air traffic controllers and those
handling landings at three local airports, said Lee Dickinson of
the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Dickinson said investigators planned to interview the regional
controllers today. The agency also expected to end its on-site
investigation of the wreckage in Cove Neck on Long Island today or
Tuesday.
   Records indicated the Boeing 707 had more than enough fuel for
the flight from Bogota and Medellin, Colombia, to New York, but the
jet flew in three holding patterns totaling nearly 90 minutes along
the East Coast because of weather-related congestion before it
crashed Thursday night, investigators said.

   In disarray since ceding power to
Solidarity, the Communists dissolved their 41-year-old party today
and broke into two new groups that will seek roles in the East
bloc's first parliamentary democracy.
   Meeting in an ornate hall at the neo-Stalinist Palace of Culture
in central Warsaw, the main body of Communists created a new social
democratic party.
   But a breakaway reformer backed by Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, former Gdansk party chief Tadeusz Fiszbach, created another
party he said he hoped would not be tainted by the remnants of the
old one.
   Poland has led the past year's whirlwind of democratic reform in
the East bloc and its Communist Party became the second in the
Warsaw Pact after Hungary to disband in an attempt to distance

   Shevardnadze's home republic, Georgia, is among those with an

   President Fidel Castro of Cuba, in defiant
rejection of the democratic reforms sweeping other Communist
nations, has declared that his country will stick to orthodox
communism even if Moscow ends all support.
   Castro's remarks in speeches Sunday, quoted in news reports,
represented the first time he has suggested the Soviets might cut
off the assistance that helps power his 31-year-old revolution.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been urging Cuba to
liberalize its political system and Moscow has cut back on aid.
   Castro said he understood that internal problems were leading
the Kremlin to cut back on its $5 billion in annual aid to Cuba, an
apparent reference to separatist movements and economic troubles
plaguing Gorbachev.
   ``The (Cuban) Revolution will not back down one millimeter, not
even if it is totally blockaded by the United States or if the
Soviet Union totally cuts off its supplies,'' said Castro.

   New government figures have confirmed what Soviet
shoppers already know: most industries in 1989 failed miserably at
fulfilling President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promise of more
consumer goods.
   A diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said what little
increase there was in consumer goods could be attributed to
inflation, a greater emphasis on producing alcohol, and imports
from the West.
   Wheat farmers had a good year, but they were about the only ones
in agriculture, according to statistics printed in most newspapers
this weekend. After an investment of $110 billion in agriculture in
1989, food production rose just 1 percent _ not the 6.6 percent
expected.
   Most of that small increase came in grain, sugarbeets and
potatoes. Soviet consumers will find the increase in the last
category hard to comprehend, since the normally ubiquitous potatoes
are hard to find and are several times more expensive on the
farmers' markets this winter.

   In the days after Hurricane Hugo smashed

   Now, many coastal residents find they need a good lawyer.
   In the wake of disputes over rental agreements, insurance

   And with the courts already overburdened by a backlog of
criminal cases, there is concern that Hugo-related cases will
further bog down the system.
   ``Somebody is bound to not be happy out there,'' said Louis
Rosen, director of the state Office of Court Administration. ``It's
one of those factors that will make a bad situation worse.''
   Hugo, which came ashore at Charleston on Sept. 21, caused an
estimated $5.9 billion in property damage, making it the most
damaging hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland. The storm was blamed
for 29 deaths in South Carolina alone.

   Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
   Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m.
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.

   Back-to-back Super Bowl victories and a San
Francisco Bay area World Series provide bright but bittersweet
highlights for Northern Californians bowed under by a deadly
earthquake and string of ghastly crimes.
   Names in the news in the past year included a teamload of sports
stars and a busload of bad guys and alleged bad guys who share Page
One in local papers.
   While the San Francisco 49ers football team returned from New
Orleans on Monday after destroying the Denver Broncos 55-10, Mayor
Art Agnos awaited receipt of a dead fish. The Rocky Mountain trout
isn't a threat, it's the centerpiece of a dinner Agnos won in a
Super Bowl bet with the mayor of Denver.
   Led by quarterback Joe Montana, San Francisco took the Super
Bowl trophy home for the fourth time as the National Football
League's first repeat champion in a decade, and ecstatic fans
gathered early for a downtown parade.
   The 49ers are being hailed as the ``team of the decades'' _ the
'80s and the '90s _ and the symbol of the region's resilience after
a year of disasters left it rattled but not ruined.

<TEXT>
   Julie Brown wants you to know that her
character on MTV's ``Just Say Julie'' is, to put it simply, sort of
crazy.
   If you've seen her ditsy cartoon of an empty-headed Valley girl,
you might agree. It's a persona she's honed with albums like
``Goddess in Progress'' and such songs and videos as ``Homecoming
Queen's Got a Gun,'' ``I Like 'Em Big and Stupid'' and ``Trapped in
the Body of a White Girl.''
   She co-wrote the movie ``Earth Girls Are Easy,'' in which she
also had a starring role, from one of her songs.
   Brown's weekly half-hour show is a tongue-in-cheek way of
introducing rock videos. It's set in her tacky condo, where friends
and relatives occasionally drop by.
   ``I make fun of the videos,'' Brown said. ``Some of them are
pretty lame. After all, if it's rock 'n' roll, it should be a
little rebellious. Poking fun at them is in the spirit of rock 'n'
roll. MTV never told me to do that. They just said, `Here's the
show.'
   ``You know, when television first started, Ernie Kovacs did a
lot of experimental comedy,'' she said. ``That was before the
networks started research to see if their shows would appeal to
people. I think research is killing a lot of good shows before they
ever get on the air. It destroys innovation and originality.''
   Brown speaks from experience. Her pilot ``Julie Brown: The
Show'' was broadcast by CBS last summer.
   ``I got amazing reviews,'' she said. ``But the research wasn't
good enough to get it on the air. Then they came up with something
called `Peaceable Kingdom.' No wonder the networks are losing their
audience to cable, because cable's still willing to experiment.''
   ``Peaceable Kingdom'' was an undistinguished drama on CBS' fall
schedule that died a quick and merciful death.
   Brown is in her second season on MTV. Of the cable music
network's three female video jockeys, two are named Julie Brown.
The other is better known as ``Downtown'' Julie Brown.
   Don't think for a moment that Brown is like her character. She
did grow up in the San Fernando Valley, the Valley Girl's natural
habitat, but she studied acting at the prestigious American
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. She's been a standup comic
and she writes her own offbeat songs.
   She and her regular writing partner, Charlie Coffey _ they wrote
the ``Earth Girls are Easy'' screenplay with Terence E. McNally _
have several more movies in development: ``Medusa: Portrait of a
Pop Legend,'' in which Brown would play a pop music superstar, and
``Totally Witchin','' a musical about a woman possessed by a
witch's spirit.
   Brown began doing a standup comedy act with Coffey while
attending ACT in San Francisco.
   ``Most female comics were taking sexuality out of their acts,''
she said. ``I thought that was a shame. Marilyn Monroe could be
sexy and funny at the same time. When I started 11 years ago, a lot
of women were doing self-deprecating humor _ `I can't get a date.'
I wasn't going to do that. I thought I was attractive.
   ``Charlie and I were very successful in San Francisco, but
people in Los Angeles didn't understand our humor,'' she said.
``Charlie left the act and I was doing a single. It's tough because
you have to be aggressive with the audience. Then I began singing,
and once I did that it became a whole new thing.''
   Brown appeared in such movies as ``Any Which Way You Can'' and
``Police Academy 2,'' and was a guest on such shows as ``The
Jeffersons,'' ``Happy Days,'' ``Laverne and Shirley'' and
``Newhart,'' where she appeared several times as airhead weather
girl Buffy Denver.
   Before starting her half-hour show on MTV, she had made several
guest appearances as a video jockey. In her early appearances, she
came on and said she was ``Downtown'' Julie Brown, who is black. At
the time, she was promoting her album ``Trapped in a White Girl's
Body.''
   When MTV offered her a show, she said, she didn't want to move
to New York.
   ``I'm an actress, and I felt that would take me out of acting,''
she said. ``We reached a solution and I do the show here. As long
as I show three videos on each show, I can do anything I want. I
can break into a video and say, `Stop, I have something to say.'''

<HEAD>YOUNG WRITER'S PLAY PREMIERS ON PUBLIC TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The making of Jonathan Marc Sherman's ``Women
and Wallace,'' premiering tonight on public TV's ``American
Playhouse,'' was unique, says David M. Davis, executive director of
the PBS series.
   ``It was,'' explains David M. Davis, executive director of the
PBS series, ``the only time we had to schedule a production when
there was a school break at Bennington.''
   The reason: Sherman, all of 19 when his comedy first was
produced at off-Broadway's Young Playwrights Festival, was a
student at the small Vermont college when Davis' production of the
play for TV was being planned.
   But things were sorted out. Sherman's TV adaption was taped,
directed by Don Scardino, its stage director.
   Because of all this, author Sherman, now a grizzled senior of
21, will go forth with two notable artistic credits when he
graduates in June.
   Sherman seems to take all this in stride. But then, he did time
in show business when younger. He acted in plays, one at the
American Jewish Theater here, and did one NBC childrens' special
and some commercials, he says.
   Still, he is supposed to be of the MTV generation. Only video
spoken there. Why write plays?
   Sherman blames it on his early exposure to theater: ``I think
doing that really influenced by interest in writing plays. All my
thoughts came to be as stage-play ideas, rather than as video
ideas. The stage really helped that.''
   His ``Women and Wallace,'' the dark kind of comedy, is about a
young man whose mother died when he was 6. It concerns the
character's efforts over a 12-year period to relate to women and
stop using humor as a defense in his dealings with them.
   As is the case of many plays and novels, this play is partly
autobiographical, says Sherman, who lives in Livingston, N.J.
   But it has a sadder real-life basis than most.
   His mother, he says, committed suicide when he was 6. Twelve
years later, having begun writing, with one play given a staged
reading at the Young Playwrights Festival, he started work on
``Women and Wallace.''
   ``I did it mostly to deal with my thoughts about my mom, and to
try to deal with it in a realistic way, not try to make it a
movie-of-the-week treatment of suicide,'' he says. ``I tried to
really get down to the stuff I went through.''
   He submitted it to the Festival, which has an age limit of 19
for all applicants and was begun in 1981 by Broadway composer
Stephen Sondheim.
   Out of 600 submissions, it was one of four chosen for
production. The reviews for the rookie were good. Sherman
good-naturedly professes not to know why the critics were kind:
``Maybe it was a good day for them or something.''
   Delegates from ``American Playhouse'' _ it produces for film,
public TV and theater _ came, saw, and bought. It was the first
Young Playwrights Festival play the company ever has purchased,
Davis says.
   ``We thought it was outstanding. We were very, very impressed
with it and we made the deal. It's as simple as that.''
   After Bennington, says Sherman, a theater major, he may go to
graduate school or continue acting and writing. He has two new
plays in mind and another he says will get a workshop tryout at the
Los Angeles Theatre Center.
   He also plans to give screenwriting a try, but doubts he ever
will call Hollywood home. ``I don't know about moving there,'' he
says, amused at the idea. ``I don't know about being attached to my
car that much.''

<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the economy's problems are several that
should have been dealt with and unexplained:
How did such a distinguished body of work emerge from so
undistinguished a life?''
   Shirley Jackson, author of the short story ``The Lottery,'' was
pictured as a heavy drinker, an amphetamine addict, grossly
overweight, a carton-a-day smoker. Arianna Stassinopoulos
Huffington portrays Pablo Picasso as a manipulative, abusive genius
who ground a cigarette into a lover's cheek.
   Biographies that paint less-than-glorious portraits of cultural
figures are not new _ Robert Frost and Sinclair Lewis come off
poorly in the definitive biographies by Lawrence Thompson and Mark
Shorer.
   And there have always been those who dismissed the biographer as
lowlife: ``Biography, like big-game hunting, is one of the
recognized forms of sport, and it is as unfair as only sport can
be,'' wrote Philip Guedalla in 1920.
   But recent biographies have been more graphic, less decorous,
less respectful of their subjects. Why?
   ``This country is publicity mad. This is all part of the
information revolution of our time,'' says critic Alfred Kazin.
   There is a preoccupation with gossip and with personal quirks,
he says. And there is an academic mania for the collection of
personal papers. ``If you publish one novel in America, the
University of Southwestern Idaho wants your files and love
letters,'' he said.
   ``We live in an era in which there is remarkable license,'' says
Albert Goldman, author of biographies of Elvis Presley and John
Lennon.
   Goldman, himself, has been accused of excessive intrusions into
his subjects' personal lives and of being inaccurate.
   Friends and admirers rushed to debunk Goldman's depictions of
Presley as a drug-addicted recluse with limited talents and of
Lennon as a volatile, debauched drug user who had a homosexual
affair with manager Brian Epstein.
   Goldman says, however, there is a growing understanding among
biographers that drugs and alcohol ``profoundly affect'' a person's
life, and psychoanalysis has made it clear that sexual matters are
all-important.
   But what is gained from these kinds of revelations about
artists? Some biographers say it helps explain the artist's work;
others say they set out to create a complete account of a life, and
these things can hardly be ignored.
   Goldman says his subjects are more than artists, and require
more than a low-keyed critical biography: ``John Lennon was
ultimately far more than an artist _ he was a saint and a martyr.
Elvis Presley was a myth.''
   Some disclosures have fueled debates within the academic
community _ disclosures that philosopher Martin Heidegger was a
member of the Nazi party, and that Paul de Man, founder of the
school of literary criticism known as deconstruction, wrote
anti-Semitic articles in Belgium in the early 1940s. Do their
transgressions invalidate _ or explain _ their theories?
   A wider debate involves Joseph Campbell, the mythologist who
gained national fame when his conversations with Bill Moyers were
broadcast _ posthumously _ by the Public Broadcasting Service.
   Campbell's credo that you should ``follow your bliss'' _ ignore
convention to find ways to be happy _ drew converts. His books
became best sellers.
   But Brendan Gill, longtime New Yorker magazine editor and
critic, complained in the New York Review of Books that not only
were Campbell's philosophies vague and imprecise but he had
privately made anti-Semitic remarks. After man landed on the moon,
Campbell allegedly told a student that ``the moon would be a good
place to put the Jews.''

   Since September, when Gill's article was published, the war has
raged between those who believe him and those who say Campbell was
innocent. Gill is unyielding: ``When he became a conspicuous public
figure and got a response of millions of people, then I had to take
up arms against him.''
   It is not clear that his efforts to alter Campbell's reputation
have had much effect. ``There's still an extraordinary interest in
his point of view. Sales have been excellent on the Campbell book
(`The Power of Myth') for the past four months,'' said Stuart
Applebaum, a spokesman for Bantam Books.
   Campbell, of course, is not around to defend himself; he has
been dead more than two years. Most biographers do not have living
subjects to contend with, and the dead cannot be libeled.
   But when Ian Hamilton attempted to write a biography of J.D.
Salinger, he found that the reclusive writer was very much alive
and willing to fight back.
   Salinger took Hamilton to court to prevent him from quoting from
his private letters, which he had copyrighted. Salinger won, and
Hamilton was reduced to writing a book about how he tried to write
a Salinger biography.
   Surviving relatives of cultural figures can be divided into
three camps.
   Some cooperate with biographers. Some have become biographers
themselves: When novelist and short story writer John Cheever died,
his daughter, Susan, disclosed his alcoholism and homosexuality in
a memoir, ``Home Before Dark.''
   ``I did it out of anguish and love,'' she said.
   Cheever's son, Ben, published his father's letters (including
sexually explicit love letters to men and women) and is preparing a
volume of his father's journals.
   But other survivors are reticent, and some are angry. Stephen
Joyce, grandson of James and Nora Joyce, was angered by Brenda
Maddox's use of a sexually explicit correspondence between the
Joyces in her book ``Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom.''
   Stephen Joyce destroyed letters he had received from his aunt
Lucia _ James Joyce's daughter, who spent time in a mental
institution _ and letters from playwright Samuel Beckett to Lucia.
Beckett had requested that his letters be destroyed; the rest were
destroyed to guard his aunt's privacy.
   ``I firmly believe that there is a part of every man or woman's
life, no matter how famous he or she may be, that should remain
private,'' Stephen Joyce wrote in a letter to The New York Times.
``Furthermore, I believe that the Joyce family's privacy has been
invaded more than that of any other writer in this century. Enough
is enough, even too much.''
   Writing in the Times, Janna Malamud Smith, daughter of novelist
and short story writer Bernard Malamud, said her family might burn
her father's papers.
   Biographers, she said, ``can extract a high and often hidden
price in exchange for satisfying our curiosity. Too often readers
end up with theories about Hemingway's identity confusion or
alcohol abuse, but lose their pleasure in his fiction. Some mystery
about the writer helps maintain the work. I remember how much my
father enjoyed knowing little about Shakespeare's life, relishing
the untethered quality that absence conferred upon his plays.''
   But Goldman says biography should not affect how we look at art:
``A biographer is concerned with the man _ a critic is concerned
with the art.'' Nor will Americans be culturally bereft if they
find their idols have feet of clay, says Kazin: ``If we had any
culture in America, it would be harder.''
   Mencken did not destroy his diaries. He placed them in the Enoch
Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, to be sealed for 25 years after
his death, and then to be opened to ``students engaged in critical
or historical investigation.'' He did not mention publication; the
trustees debated the issue before going ahead.
   The book is mostly a list of Mencken's daily doings, mixed with
a few observations about people and events and the complaints of a
notorious hypochondriac. Just a few words are objectionable:
``kikes'' and ``shrewd Jew'' and ``linthead,'' among them.
   The editor, Charles A. Fecher, says the diaries prove Mencken
was an anti-Semite and felt that blacks were inferiors. The
revelations led the National Press Club to consider renaming the
Mencken Memorial Library, and induced the winner of an award named
after Mencken to refuse the honor.
   But New York Times columnist Russell Baker, who knew Mencken
from his early days at The Sun in Baltimore, noted that there is no
evidence that Mencken ever acted in a bigoted way. The diary
entries were ``night faults,'' Baker said.
   Others argue that the offensive jottings were more reflective of
Mencken's times _ an era when words like ``kikes'' and ``hunkies''
and ``wops'' were the stuff of conversation _ than of Mencken
himself.
   What would Mencken have said? Should a man's private musings
affect the way his public accomplishments are regarded? ``The
public ... demands certainties. It must be told definitely and a
bit raucously that this is true and that is false. But there are no
certainties,'' he once wrote.
   But he also wrote: ``Nothing can come out of an artist that is
not in the man.''

   Now that they've won their freedom, what does
the future hold for the people of Eastern Europe? Hard times are
ahead it seems. To make economic reforms work in the new
democracies will require a lot of personal sacrifice and massive
infusion of aid from the West.

   In Eastern Europe, ideology has
once again come face-to-face with hard reality. Making a revolution
is often easier than fulfilling its goals.
   After overthrowing four decades of rigid Communist rule, the
people of Eastern Europe are facing enormous problems. The outlook
is grim.
   The years of centrally planned systems and Communist
mismanagement have left East European economies in such ruins that
a lot of help from the West and plenty of sacrifices of their own
will be necessary before the countries can stand on their own feet.
   It will take years. During the adjustment to a free-market
system, the governments will have to deal with unemployment,
bankruptcies, inflation, huge debts and other problems _ even an
atrophied work ethic.
   Poland owes $40 billion to Western creditors, Hungary and
Yugoslavia about $20 billion each. Yugoslavia's inflation rate is
more than 1,500 percent annually.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa acknowledges that the
shock-therapy plan to tame inflation and transform Poland into a
free-market economy is painful and needs massive infusion of
Western aid.
   ``We are like a car with four wheels running in different
directions, moving fast but slipping backward. Nothing can be done
from inside the car,'' Walesa recently told an Associated Press
reporter in Gdansk.
   He said foreign aid already promised is insufficient.
   ``It is too slow and too little. This is why I see this (reform
plan) as blacker and blacker. We cannot reform our old system
within our own means. This is impossible without outside help.''
   Poland was the forerunner in the democratic transformation when
it became the first Eastern European country to establish a
non-communist government. In 1990, leaders of other nations will be
watching Poland to evaluate the progress of its economic recovery.
   The plan, which went into effect on Jan. 1, decontrolled prices,
foreign exchange and centrally allocated industrial quotas. It is
based on a restrictive budget policy designed to bring down
inflation within six months and is coupled with a tight wage policy.
   It is the most radical, daring economic reform program ever
attempted in Eastern Europe.
   ``The course of our reforms is giving stimulation to the changes
in other countries of the region. The failure of the efforts could
make more difficult the evolution occurring in Central and Eastern
Europe,'' Polish Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Parliament on Jan.
18.
   Yugoslavia's similar plan includes a six-month wage freeze,
strict monetary controls, closing down of unprofitable companies
and liberalized imports to provide more competition to domestic
industries. A currency reform is designed to make the dinar
convertible.
   Both Poland and Yugoslavia were advised on their programs by
Jeffrey Sachs, a professor of economics at Harvard.
   Although the wage freeze has already triggered a fresh wave of
strikes in Yugoslavia, Sachs predicts they will gradually cease as
cheaper imports bring down domestic prices.
   The political focus in the area will be on free elections that
are scheduled for 1990 throughout the region.
   Also, Poland and Czechoslovakia have asked the Soviets to
withdraw their troops from the two countries and Budapest has
requested an accelerated pace of the Soviet pullout from Hungary.
   Free parliamentary elections are scheduled in East Germany,
Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia, and local elections in Poland
are expected to be moved up to April.
   In the Soviet Union, all 15 republics will hold local elections
that will offer a choice of candidates for the first time. Bulgaria
is also expected to hold free elections although the date has not
been fixed.
   In non-aligned Yugoslavia, the Communists are expected to
compete for the first time with other groups in parliamentary
elections that could take place as early as April.
   Although it broke away from the Soviet bloc in 1948 and for
years followed its own model of more liberal communism, Yugoslavia
has fallen behind in the pace of political reforms going on in
other East European countries.
   Like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia is a country of a delicate
ethnic balance and different republics where nationalist feelings
could jeopardize the transition to democracy.
   The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are pushing
for independence from the Soviet Union, strong nationalist
movements have emerged in Georgia and Moldavia, which borders
Romania, while Armenia and Azerbaijan are practically at civil war.
   Moscow has sent thousands of soldiers to quell an uprising in
the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan, in the latest challenge to the
Kremlin's authority.
   The Western-most Yugoslav republic of Slovenia is also toying
with secession and its economic relations with the largest republic
of Serbia have been cut.
   A 10-year drive for more autonomy by the ethnic Albanians, most
of them Moslems, in the southern province of Kosovo resulted in
violent street demonstrations put down by security troops at the
cost of nearly 30 lives last year.

   Tension continues and police used tear gas and water cannon on
Jan. 24 to disperse 40,000 ethnic Albanians demanding an end to the
state of emergency still in force in the province.
   Relations between Serbia and Croatia, the second largest
republic, are also tense and the pro-democracy opposition is split
along nationalist lines. The ruling Communist Party is split into
factions with very different ideas about the future course of the
country.
   The disputes came to a climax at the emergency party congress
that broke up in disarray on Jan. 22 when Slovenia's delegates
walked out, unhappy with the scope of reforms being proposed.
Earlier, the congress had voted to give up the party's monopoly on
power, but hard-liners from Serbia vehemently opposed the Slovenian
party's drive for more autonomy and a looser party structure.
   Neighboring Albania remains the last bastion of Stalinism in
Eastern Europe, but is showing cautious signs of emerging from its
self-imposed isolation. Reports in Yugoslav and Greek newspapers of
recent disturbances in Albania have been strongly denied by Tirana.
   Thousands of Bulgarians have demonstrated against restoring the
rights of Moslem ethnic Turks.
   Such outbreaks of nationalism and ethnic fighting are reviving
fears of instability that once made the Balkans the powder keg of
Europe. They could sap the energies needed for an orderly
transition to democracy and take precious time away from pressing
economic problems.
   The Communists have lost their constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power in most Eastern European countries, but they
still have powerful assets that give them an organizational
advantage over the opposition in the campaigns leading to the
elections.
   While getting rid of the old, Stalinist leaders, the Communists
have reorganized themselves, changing their names in some cases,
and are not going to give up without a fight at the ballot box.
   In East Germany, for example, the Communists still exercise
extensive control over the media and are using it skillfully to
undermine the disorganized, fractured and inexperienced opposition.
   Lack of faith in reforms is driving more than 1,500 East Germans
daily to resettle in West Germany. Last year, more than 340,000
East Germans moved to West Germany, and Bonn officials say the
number could double in 1990.
   ``The Communist Party will get many votes unless it splits up,''
says Markus Meckel, a leader of the East German Social Democratic
Party.
   Ulrich Stockman, another member of the party, says it is hard to
organize people politically after 40 years of apathy under
Communist rule.
   ``People have felt lost, with all these new parties coming up
all the time,'' after decades of political unawareness, Stockman
said.
   Krisztina Bokor, a 50-year-old Budapest manager, recently
expressed some of the pessimism building up in Hungary in the wake
of revolutionary euphoria.
   ``The elections will be characterized by apathy. Most people are
apolitical because there is no real motivation to get them to
become involved.''
   ``The country has no political culture. I do not expect any
positive changes to come about in my lifetime. Nor in that of the
next generation,'' Mrs. Bokor said.
   Mrs. Edit Somlai, a 29-year-old Budapest teacher, said the
country was moving toward democracy, ``but unfortunately it won't
bring a better economic situation in our lifetime.''
   Unlike Poland or Czechoslovakia, where world-famous novelist and
playwright Vaclav Havel has become president, East Germany's
pro-democracy movement lacks charismatic leaders that could unite
the mushrooming groups. In Hungary, opposition groups also are
bickering, weakening their election prospects.
   But a democratically elected government in East Germany can
count on West German aid to prop up its sluggish economy.
   For all the problems facing Eastern Europe, they pale in
comparison with those that are confronting Mikhail Gorbachev,
president of the Soviet Union.
   Bloody ethnic strife in the Transcaucasia, the uprising in
Azerbaijan and strivings for independence of Baltic states threaten
his political future.
   Perestroika and glasnost have been a huge success for
Gorbachev's image abroad. But at home, the stores are empty.
   Food rationing continues in most parts of the vast country, with
monthly ceilings on the amounts of tea, meat, sugar, matches and
other staples that Soviets can buy.
   Perhaps the most crucial issue of 1990 will be to determine the
Communist Party's role in the Soviet society and its monopoly on
power. The provision already has been struck from the constitution
in Lithuania in favor of a multiparty system and Latvia's
legislature has moved to do the same.
   Gorbachev says that any move to alter the party's role must be
linked to wider reforms. The 28th national party congress is
scheduled for October in Moscow and is expected to make the
Communists' role one of its major topics.
   In the local elections, voters will be able to choose between
several candidates. Voters in many areas are expected to reject
Communist candidates in favor of nationalists, populists and
maverick Communists not backed by the local party potentates.

   In South Africa, feminism is viewed with
suspicion as a foreign philosophy, even among many women. With
racial discrimination the overriding social issue, sexist practices
go unchecked in both white and black communities. There are few
protests, for a variety of reasons.

   In a country where racial
segregation is a way of life, most women in South Africa endure an
additional, pervasive form of discrimination that draws little
protest or publicity _ sexism.
   Black and white women experience and react to it differently,
but most accept paternalism and restriction of their freedom as a
routine part of life.
   While attitudes toward women in South Africa may be no worse
than in many Third World countries, South Africans like to point to
the ``First World standards'' of their society. But their tolerance
of male chauvinism, sexist treatment in the media, and the inferior
legal status of women would provoke outrage in North America and
most of Europe. Some examples:
   _John Bishop, the evening news announcer on government-run
television, says, ``Coming up next, acceptance by the South African
Air Force of its first girls for pilot training.''
   _The country's premier black actor, John Kani, gives a newspaper
interview about being directed in ``Othello'' by actress Janet
Suzman: ``I am an African man, and, as such, I find it hard to take
orders from a woman. But Janet is very wooing. She makes you feel
well cared for.''
   _Foreign Minister Pik Botha tells a heckler who opposes his
politics: ``I don't argue with pretty women. I do other things with
them.''
   The comments don't prompt letters to the editor, pickets,
protests or calls for the minister's resignation as they might in
many Western countries.
   ``The average South African woman doesn't notice that because
she's conditioned to that kind of thing,'' says Sheena Duncan, a
prominent member of several anti-apartheid organizations, including
the Black Sash, a civil rights group founded by white women.
   ``There is so much to do, one gets tired. I'm not saying the
struggle for black political liberty takes priority, but in
practical terms, you have got only so much time and energy and
skill to devote.''
   Anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress and
the Congress of South African Trade Unions have anti-sexism clauses
in their anti-racist constitutions.
   But in practice, despite the examples of women who have marched,
staged sit-ins, endured beatings, detention and assassinations,
black men are no more shy than whites about ridiculing or
patronizing women.
   At last July's national convention of the mostly black Congress
of South African Trade Unions, a resolution to condemn sexual
harassment in unions was defeated amid comments that women brought
such treatment on themselves and had contributed little to the
labor movement.
   Emma Mashinini, 60, who founded one of the largest black unions,
the Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, says she's
disappointed that no woman has been elected to the congress's
executive committee.
   Of the dozens of black and white officials and activists who
have streamed to Victor Verster prison farm in Paarl to discuss the
political future of South Africa with ANC leader Nelson Mandela,
only a half-dozen have been women, including his relatives and old
friends.
   ``It's very prestigious these days to say you have gone to see
Mandela,'' Mashinini says. When she called the trade union congress
to complain about the absence of women in the union delegation, a
woman told her it was all right because Mandela had named those he
wanted to see.
   ``The issue of sexism is totally subordinated to larger
political questions in this country and women are allowing it,''
says Jo-Anne Collinge, a journalist who worked for many years at
The Star, the nation's largest daily.
   A beauty queen or some other young woman in a swimsuit or shorts
is on the front page of most mainstream papers several times a week.

   From time to time a suspect under the strain of
questioning will confess to a crime he didn't commit. Here's a
strange case in West Virginia in which two men confessed to the
same murders. The first was freed and the second was tried and
convicted. Now he's going to be tried a second time.

   A decade ago Paul Reggettz III spent 11
months behind bars after confessing that he murdered his wife and
their two children. He was freed after a former neighbor confessed
to the same crime.
   Reggettz has spent the past 10 years struggling to rebuild his
life, painfully aware of the stares and whispers of those who still
think he's guilty.
   Now the second man who confessed, John Moss Jr., is to stand
trial again, in March. His previous conviction on three
first-degree murder counts was overturned because of a judge's
mistakes.
   ``I don't want to keep reliving that nightmare,'' Reggettz says.
``Every five years will I have to because of the state Supreme
Court? Where are my rights? I'd like to have the right to get on
with my life.''
   The nightmare began on Dec. 13, 1979, the cold, rainy day
Reggettzrushed into a restaurant a block up the narrow dirt street
from his family's one-story house in nearby St. Albans. He called
police and said: ``You've got to help me. My wife's dead.''
   Police found Vanessa Reggettz, 26, lying on the bedroom floor,
beaten, strangled and stabbed with a pair of scissors. Their
7-year-old son, Paul Eric, was found in the bathtub, apparently
choked with an electrical cord before being drowned. Their
4-year-old daughter, Bernadette, had been strangled and was hanging
from a cord strung over a door.
   As the bodies were carried from the white frame house, Reggettz,
then a 36-year-old United Parcel Service worker, was taken to state
police headquarters for questioning. He was interrogated for 21
straight hours, with no food or sleep. Police deny any
improprieties, but Reggettz says he was bullied, threatened,
knocked to the floor and had a gun held to his head.
   Finally, he says, the shock of seeing his family murdered,
combined with the terror of the interrogation, overwhelmed him,
broke his will. He confessed.
   ``The children were screaming and crying,'' he told
investigators. ``My head felt like it was going to explode and I
had to put a stop to the noise.''
   Reggettz was taken back to the house where his family had been
slaughtered and re-enacted the slayings for police and Kanawha
County Prosecutor Mike Roark.
   ``I was put under so much pressure, tremendous pressure,''
Reggettz says. ``Now, what's pressure to me might not be pressure
to you. You might stand 10 times the pressure. I was put in a
pressure situation where I would have told them I was anybody or
anything doing anything they wanted. Anything.
   ``And people say, `You mean to tell me you would lie and say
that?' ... I didn't want to lie. Why would I want to say something
I didn't do?
   ``But lying got to where it didn't mean anything out of fear.
Fear won over the lying ... I would have told them anything _
anything _ to get them to leave me alone and not put pressure on
me.''
   An autopsy report estimated the time of death at midnight, well
before Reggettz left for work at 1:45 a.m.
   The case seemed cut-and-dried, and Circuit Judge John Hey sent
Reggettz to jail without bond. Charges against Reggettz were
dropped before he went to trial, but he lost his job while behind
bars.
   ``Three times _ and I'm not trying to get dramatic _ three times
I planned suicide in there,' Reggettz says. ``I came to the very
end of my rope three different occasions.
   ``I thought dying would have to be better than living.''
   Ten months after the slayings, and the day after Hey refused to
throw out Reggettz's confession, Moss told police he committed the
murders.
   In jail in Cleveland on other charges at the time, Moss was a
former neighbor of the Reggettz family. He had been named in
Reggettz's indictment as a participant in the slayings, but he
wasn't indicted then because he was 17.
   Tests showed that some of the blood found in the Reggettz home
didn't come from the victims or from Reggettz, but did match Moss'
blood type.

   Moss also was linked to several items reported stolen from the
Reggettz home.
   The medical examiner changed the estimated time of death, which
he had based on Reggettz's confession, to sometime in the early
morning after Reggettz had left for work.
   Roark finally conceded he believed Reggettz was at work 25 miles
away in Rand when the murders occurred, and Hey dropped the charges
against him.
   Moss contended he also was forced into a false confession by the
state trooper who interrogated Reggettz, but Hey refused to throw
out his tape-recorded statement. His defense lawyer argued that
Reggettz committed the murders, picturing him as a volatile father
with no affection for his family, and as a former motorcycle gang
member who worshipped Satan.
   A jury deliberated 14 hours before convicting Moss in 1984, five
years after the slayings.
   But the state Supreme Court in December 1988 ordered a new trial
for Moss on three grounds.
   The court said the judge erred when he refused to poll each
juror about possible exposure to prejudicial comments made by the
prosecutor and broadcast on local radio and television stations
during the trial.
   The court also said the judge allowed the prosecutor to make
prejudicial comments during his closing arguments, including
statements that Moss has ``a ruthless, vicious, diseased criminal
mind'' and should never be released ``to slaughter women and
children in Kanawha County.''
   The court also said Hey failed to allow admission of evidence
regarding a polygraph test Reggettz took.
   Despite Moss' widely publicized trial, Reggettz still runs
across people who assume he was guilty.
   ``All this many years later they act like I was the one who was
tried, and I'm out running around when I ought to be locked up,''
he says. ``I have a problem understanding that ...
   ``If you liked me before this stuff happened you'll probably say
I didn't do it. And if you didn't like me, you'll probably say I
did it. I've seen it with my own eyes.''
   During a recent shopping trip, for example, Reggettz says he
waited outside a discount store while his wife _ he remarried seven
years ago _ went through the checkout line.
   ``I was standing outside looking through the window waiting for
her, and the woman checking her out said: `You know who that is?
That's Paul Reggettz. That's the guy who killed his family.' And my
wife said, `That's my husband.' The woman didn't know what to say.''
   Reggettz, 46, now lives in South Charleston and earns his living
doing odd jobs. A self-described born-again Christian who refound
his faith in jail, he and his wife have no children, but he said
they're considering adoption.
   A member of a Pentecostal church, Reggettz struggles to explain
his concept of good and evil when asked why his family died.
   ``I believe there's a God in heaven,'' he said. ``I believe
there's a Satan _ a real, live living devil ...
   ``He's an evil thing out to destroy, kill. And I think he was
the instigator. He used somebody to destroy my family. He'll use
anybody that's open to his influence.
   ``Explain to me why a guy suddenly, one day he walks off the job
and goes home and gets three or four guns and a thousand rounds of
ammunition and goes to a school and starts shooting up kids. I
don't believe that one day the man says, `I think I'm going to kill
a bunch of kids today.' I'm sure a lot of them have thought that.
But they may have help thinking of it.''
   Ten years later, Reggettz says he's not bitter about what
happened to him.
   ``I used to be,'' he says. ``It took me a long time to get to
where I'm at today.
   ``The state of West Virginia, the state police, some of them
made mistakes. Fine. Everybody's going to make mistakes. The
state's not perfect. The state police are not perfect. Mike Roark's
not perfect. The judges aren't perfect.
   ``I know a lot of people made big mistakes in my case. But the
mistake would be even worse if I let it eat me alive.''

   When an ordinary man leading an ordinary life
wakes up one morning to discover that he can fly, his life is
transformed. Right? Not in the fantasy world of Randy Cohen, where
people seldom have their feet on the ground.

<TEXT>
   Randy Cohen isn't able to fly or live in a tree
but he likes to think about it.
   So, Cohen does the next best thing: He writes about people who
do.
   His strangely talented people appear as a series of comic pieces
in his book, ``Diary of a Flying Man,'' published by Knopf.
   Cohen, a soft-spoken, amiable 41-year-old, occupies an office in
midtown Manhattan that looks out on a building he regards as ``an
architectural inconvience, full of hard-working people _ no crimes
being committed, no affairs blossoming, nothing.''
   The wall above his desk houses a large collection of pictures.
All of children. A closer look reveals they are all of the same
child. ``It's my daughter, Sophie, 2. I took a lot of pictures of
her so people would think I have a big family.''
   While in the office, Cohen works as a writer for the ``Late
Night With David Letterman'' television show. He and nine other
staff writers are responsible for ``generating amusing things _ the
ongoing task that awaits weekly.'' During his six years with the
show, Cohen has come up with ideas as varied as attaching a
miniature camera to a monkey's head and having him shoot the show
that night as well as a ``musical piece trivializing glasnost.''
   The pieces in his book are not from the TV show. ``The book is a
lot darker and bleaker than the show, but I like to think it is
very, very funny,'' Cohen says.
   The title piece tells of an ``ordinary man leading an ordinary
life'' who wakes up one morning and finds he can fly.
   He exults: ``Mankind's oldest dream has become my reality: I can
fly. This morning, running after a $5 bill blowing along the
pavement, I simply lifted into the air. What profound
transformation will my life undergo? Unfortunately, the five turned
out to be a torn page from Sunday's fashion supplement.''
   Which pretty well sums up Cohen's way of looking at things. As
he says, ``The man believes the ability to fly will transform his
life. It doesn't. Instead of walking to the cash machine and
finding it doesn't work, now you can fly there and find it doesn't
work. I think that if all your dreams come true things would still
be the same. Say you get super-strength. So you lift up the phone
book and order in a pizza, then you tear the phone book in half.
Big deal, the pizza will still be cold when you get it, assuming it
arrives at all.''
   As for the men who live in trees, the thesis is, says Cohen,
that ``men lead crude, primitive lives and should be pathetically
grateful that women invite them indoors. Left to their own devices,
men will revert to barbarism. But the guys in the trees are happy.
They can eat food without sauces and throw their clothes on the
floor _ in this case on the branches.''
   As one tree dweller puts it: ``I don't have framed prints on the
wall. I don't give little dinner parties. I haven't ironed anything
since 1973. What kind of life is that? It's my life.''
   Here is an excerpt from one of the pieces in the diary. It's
called ``Sleep Problems'':
   ``Connie's postal obsessions keep her up for hours. `I worry how
long the lines will be at the post office tomorrow. Did I put
enough postage on the letters I mailed today? Did I casually apply
a stamp that will be worth thousands to collectors in 30 years? Is
it unethical to use the Rutherford B. Hayes commemorative when I
disapprove of so many policies of his administration, particularly
his use of federal troops against striking railroad workers? It's
all so trivial, but my mind grinds on. Then I panic: if I don't
fall asleep right now, tomorrow I'll be too tired to get anything
done. At that point I'm doomed. I get up, put on my robe, go into
the living room, phone someone I loathe, and threaten them in a
disguised voice, usually this high-pitched nasal twang.'''
   Cohen came to humor writing in a funny way.
   ``I used to play drums in a rock 'n' roll band. And I could
introduce a song with funny banter. Since I was a flamboyantly
inadequate drummer, it was suggested to me that I give up drums and
become a stand-up comic. So I became a free-lance writer. I sold my
pieces and I made enough to eat modestly. Free-lance writers are
famous for low cholesterol.''
   He says he applied for a job with the Letterman show when he
found his wife planned to work at home ``and it terrified us that
both of us would be at home. I turned in a sample of my work _ sort
of a comedy writing test _ and I was hired. I'm sure it was a
clerical error. The piece I submitted can still conjure up visceral
embarrassment at its inadequacies.''

   Robert Urich believes there's more to the
story of convicted wife-killer Rob Marshall than is revealed in his
portrayal of Marshall in the TV miniseries ``Blind Faith.''
   The two-part NBC series on Sunday and Monday is based on the Joe
McGinniss book about Marshall, who was sentenced to death on a
charge of arranging for the murder of his wife in Toms River, N.J.,
in 1984.
   ``I think this might be described as one scenario of what
happened,'' says Urich. ``It's based on the book, which is based on
interviews. I'm convinced there's more to it than comes out in the
book or the miniseries.
   ``But it's not an actor's job to make moral judgments about the
character. This is the first time I've played in a real documented
story. It bothered me that we might take license with the real
story.
   ``I play a man who says he's innocent. The story is told from
other people's points of view. If they say he looked suspicious or
broke down and cried, that's what I had to do. Overall, I had
problems of accurately nailing down his mood and tone.''
   Urich has returned to California after ending his Boston-based
role as the tough private detective in ABC's ``Spenser: For Hire.''
He has sold his 20-room, 15-acre home near Boston and bought a
smaller house in the San Fernando Valley.
   Last spring Urich was seen as Jake Spoon, a former law officer
who also worked as an outlaw, in the hit CBS miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove.'' He is now preparing for his first situation comedy since
his brief appearance in ``Soap'' 12 years ago.
   ``It was knowing I was going to do a comedy that allowed me to
do something as different and as dark as `Blind Faith,''' he says.
   Urich says he felt fortunate that Roby Marshall, one of
Marshall's three sons, acted as an adviser and was available on the
set of ``Blind Faith.''
   ``This was a man who presented the picture of a perfect
father,'' Urich says. ``There was something compelling about this
guy. I did have the benefit of having his son, Roby, by my side. I
felt I could believe him when he said his father's hand shook or he
lost his composure.''
   ``Blind Faith'' was adapted by John Gay and directed by Paul
Wendkos. It also stars Joanna Kerns as Rob's wife, Maria, David
Gray as Roby, Jay Underwood as son Jay, Johnny Galecki as son John,
Dennis Farina as prosecutor Kevin Kelly, Robin Strasser as
Marshall's mistress, Felice Richmond, Joe Spano as Marshall's best
friend, Sal Coccaro, Doris Roberts as a friend of Marshall's mother
and William Forsythe as the man who testified he arranged for
Maria's murder.
   ``As much as anything, it's a story of the survival of these
boys and how this catastrophe affected their lives,'' Urich says.
   After completing ``Spenser: For Hire,'' Urich went to Texas for
his role in ``Lonesome Dove.'' Then he did movies for Disney, USA
Network and CBS.
   ``Spenser'' was based on Robert Parker's books about the tough
Boston detective.
   ``The problem with `Spenser' or any detective on a network is
you can't really pinpoint the audience,'' Urich says. ``You can't
do the violence or the language or the elements necessary for the
story. Spenser in the books was probably more ruthless, but I felt
America didn't need another hero who broke the law and all the
rules.''
   In his new comedy, ``American Dreamer,'' created by Gary David
Goldberg (``Family Ties'') for NBC, Urich plays a former broadcast
journalist named Tom Nash who returns to his hometown with his
children after his wife is killed in a terrorist bombing. He writes
a column for a Chicago newspaper.
   ``I call it a version of `Our Town' for television,'' he says.
``It's one man's reflection on life. He brings along all his
emotional baggage. He stands in a spot of life and travels back and
forth in time. Then a scene lights up and he steps into the action.
I play the role at all ages.''
   Urich's last appearance in a theatrical film was in ``Turk 182''
in 1985, although people remember him most for ``Ice Pirates'' in
1984.
   ``I'd like to do more features, but I've managed to stay
unavailable because of my work for television,'' he says.
   He's also acquired a small publishing company, Beaver Dam Press
in Nashville, Tenn., and plans to re-issue the outdoor books by
Nash Buckingham.

<HEAD>Brazilian TV Network _ Many Hate It But Everybody Watches It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On any given night in prime time,
85 million of Brazil's 150 million people stare into their
television screens, eagerly consuming the fare offered up by
85-year-old Roberto Marinho and his TV Globo network.
   That's an astounding share of Brazil's potential viewing public
of 100 million. Even those who say they hate what Marinho stands
for and want his network broken up can't resist the magnetic pull.
   Not only is it Brazil's largest network, it is the largest in
the Third World and, on a global basis, is generally considered to
rank fourth after NBC, ABC and CBS in the United States.
   An average of 96.6 million Americans watch TV each night,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co., with the three major networks
attracting 60 million of them.
   Thus Roberto Marinho and TV Globo _ with a whopping 85 percent
share of the Brazilian audience _ soars into the ratings
stratosphere.
   The network has 15,000 employees and 70 stations reaching nearly
all of Brazil's 4,000 cities and towns.
   All of that, however, leaves some Brazilians deeply worried that
Marinho has far too much influence for Brazil's good.
   None of the three other Brazilian networks, independents or
educational TV come near to competing with TV Globo's recognized
quality or popularity.
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba is a fan, although he would place
himself at the opposite end of the ideological field from Marinho.
Castro's addiction is a TV Globo soap-opera sold throughout Latin
America titled ``A Escrava Isaura'' (``Isaura the Slave'').
   TV Globo's soaps _ called ``novelas'' _ draw the largest number
of viewers. The network also attracts an audience with first-run
movies, dubbed into Portuguese, such as ``Raiders of the Lost
Ark.'' It offers sophisticated, far-ranging news coverage _ first
on the scene of fires, floods, bus crashes and Cabinet resignations.
   Yet the cries often go up: ``Break up TV Globo!''
   Books, magazine articles and politicians charge that so vast a
TV network is simply too powerful _ most particularly in a country
where millions barely can read and turn to television for
information as well as entertainment.
   The direct target of the criticism is the iconoclastic
billionaire Marinho, who also has his hand in newspapers, radio,
book and magazine publishing and communications systems.
   Critics charge that Marinho uses his conglomerate to push a
right-wing, pro-business, anti-populist political message.
   Marinho, whose physical bearing belies his age by 15 or 20
years, doesn't deny it.
   ``We openly supported the candidacy of Fernando Collor de
Mello,'' Marinho unabashedly told a group of reporters in Rio de
Janeiro recently. He was referring to the victor in Brazilian
elections in December _ the first free presidential vote in almost
30 years.
   Conservative, pro-free enterprise Collor de Mello defeated a
Marxist-oriented opponent in a final runoff by a slim margin and is
to take office March 15.
   But when Marinho asserted that his media conglomerate also gave
time and space to competing candidates, skeptics _ sharing a widely
held belief that Marinho ordered slanted coverage to favor Collor
de Mello _ laughed aloud; some walked out.
   The silver-haired magnate envisions his media might with a
proselytizing mission: ``This is not the United States. We have an
obligation to reach not only the cultured people but also those of
the lowest classes.''
   And indeed, the first signs of modern progress in Brazil's
wretched ``favelas,'' or hillside slums, often are TV aerials
sprouting from the roofs of miserable shacks.
   ``Brazil cannot be governed with Roberto Marinho having the
power he does,'' says the leftist-populist Leonel Brizola, former
governor of Rio de Janeiro and one of 21 candidates who ran for the
presidency.
   During his unsuccessful campaign, Brizola promised: ``On the
first morning of my first day in office I will re-examine the
monopoly of the `TV Globo Party,' the biggest party in Brazil. That
network must be taken off the air.''
   Brizola finished third and was eliminated from the deciding
runoff.
   ``TV Globo is agile and efficient, with a level of quality that
makes it the leader in the ratings,'' said Professor Jose Marques
de Melo, the head of the School of Communications and Arts at the
University of Sao Paulo, the nation's largest and most prestigious
learning center. ``But its professional conduct during the
elections left a lot to be desired.''
   ``Brazil needs a code of ethics for news media,'' Marques de
Melo added.
   Ricardo Kotscho, the press spokesman for the losing presidential
candidate in the finals, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, said Marinho's
extremely successful newspaper O Globo of Rio de Janeiro, which
openly endorsed Color de Mello, ``lost all its credibility in the
campaign and also its morals.''
   In his session with the newsmen, Marinho said, ``A newspaper can
support whomever it wants.'' He added that O Globo gave coverage to
the other candidates even though he personally didn't like them.
   ``I have been called a fascist,'' Marinho said. ``But when I was
young, I boxed and practiced jiu-jitsu and karate. I know how to
hit as well as get hit.''
   Marinho inherited the newspaper O Globo (The World) after his
father, Irineu Marinho, died just three weeks after founding the
paper in 1925. He expanded into radio in the 1940s and now runs a
money-making nationwide radio network.
   TV Globo went on the air in 1965. Time-Life Broadcasting of the
United States once held a minority interest in it, leading to
charges that TV Globo was a mouthpiece for ``American
imperialism.'' But now the Globo empire belongs exclusively to
Marinho, his brothers and his sons.
   TV Globo spends lavishly to produce its prime-time novelas,
which draw ratings of over 90 percent at home. Translated from the
Portuguese, they are exported to the rest of Latin America, Western
Europe, Scandinavia, the Middle East, the Orient and U.S.
Spanish-language stations.
   Marinho lives in the best mogul style, in a fabulous estate high
in the hills overlooking Rio, near the famous Christ the Redeemer
statue on Corcovado peak.
   The Roberto Marinho Foundation finances free art exhibits and
open-air concerts and operas for Brazil's poor masses and also a
televised adult-education course that has given some 4 million
Brazilian dropouts a chance to acquire high school-equivalency
diplomas.
   In 1964, when a right-wing military regime seized power and
ruled for 21 years, Marinho and his media voices were solidly
behind it.
   Brizola, exiled during the military dictatorship but later
granted amnesty, says, ``I am not against Roberto Marinho
personally, but in Brazil an essential public service such as radio
and television must be made more democratic.''
   Marinho's response: ``Mr. Brizola can provoke me all he wants.
It won't do him any good.''
   Married twice and recently estranged from his second wife,
Marinho did not flinch when a reporter asked him about his current
relationship with a Rio society figure, Lily de Carvalho, an old
flame from his younger days.
   ``She is a widow and a free woman,'' he said.
   ``Age does not interfere with companionship. I don't drink. I
don't smoke. I exercise. I go underwater fishing without an
aqualung. I don't spend any sleepless nights.''

   Do you remember that day in 1969 when you and your family
huddled around the television set for an unbelievable sight: Neil
Armstrong stepping down to the powdery surface of the moon and and
saying, ``One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind?''
   If you were a parent, you probably took photographs of your
children watching this milestone of human history.
   Our memories are linked to flickering images on the 17-inch
screen. Now the moon-exploration experience can be viewed on the
big screen in the way that the astronauts saw it. A new feature
documentary, ``For All Mankind,'' takes you inside the space
capsule and onto the surface of the moon in color and with absolute
clarity.
   A magazine writer named Al Steinert is responsible for the film.
Ten years ago, he began wondering about all the movies that the 13
astronauts took during their flights and lunar explorations. The
film _ 6 million feet of it _ remained in the NASA vaults,
available for public view. Nobody had ever thought of reviewing all
of it. Al Steinert did.
   The most dramatic sequences were selected, then painstakingly
expanded from 16mm to 35mm film. As a result, the film is
remarkably clear, even on huge screens. Only the shots at the
Johnson Space Center betray graininess.
   Despite the familiarity of all the moon adventures, ``For All
Mankind'' seems entirely new. It is far more exhilarating than a
``Star Trek'' movie, and it evokes renewed awe at the courage of
the astronauts.
   Steinert wisely allows the astronauts themselves to relate the
story, in their communications with Earth and in reminiscences he
recorded in recent times. He tells the story linearly, starting
with the suiting up at Cape Canaveral, the awesome liftoff and the
silent, dream-like soar through the outer limits.
   The moon sequences are blissfully lyrical, aided by the
other-worldly music by Brian Eno, Roger Eno and Dan Lanois. The
understated comments by the astronauts add immeasurably to the
storytelling.
   ``For All Mankind,'' which was produced by Reinert and Betsy
Broyles Brier, has been appearing in test engagements around the
country, having acquired no distributor. The film is unrated, but
it offers a profound experience for all ages, particularly
youngsters to whom space travel seems unremarkable. Running time:
80 minutes.

   ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' (Orion Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $79.98. Rated R.)
   
   ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' is a hilarious,
dark farce of the trouble men cause women. Full of improbable
relationships and impossible coincidences, this subtitled film from
Spain has been a big hit in the United States. And for many good
reasons.
   Among them is Carmen Maura, who plays the passionate, beautiful
Pepa, the central character of director Pedro Almodovar's movie.
   Pepa and Ivan (Fernando Guillen) share a penthouse apartment in
Madrid and when Ivan abruptly leaves her, Pepa sets off on a
desperate course to get him back. Along the way, she encounters her
friend Candela, who is involved with a man who turns out to be a
Shiite terrorist; Ivan's wife, who spent 20 years in a mental
hospital; a feminist lawyer who is her successor as Ivan's lover;
and a taxi driver who supplies his fares with music, magazines and
drinks.
   There is melodrama galore _ a suicide attempt, a nearly hijacked
jetliner, an unplanned pregnancy, barbiturate-spiked gazpacho and
stakeouts. But ``Women on the Verge'' never resorts to slapstick.
   Pepa and Ivan are actors, Pepa playing the mother of a murderer
in a television show. They also both dub films, and in one she
plays a bride. At the altar, the priest whispers that she must not
trust any man, not even her husband and then hands her a condom.
   Throughout there is a sense of loss of control, a frantic pace.
Everything is just out of wack. And that is the part of the
wonderful charm of ``Women on the Verge.''

   ``Feel'' (RCA) _ Human Drama
   
   Sometimes you can judge a record by its cover.
   Johnny Indovina, the singer-leader of Human Drama, poses on
``Feel'' with bare chest, beads and necklaces, black nail polish
and crucifix earring, his face darkened by shadows, his hair
hanging in front of his eyes like a mask.
   This is music for the white makeup, black leather and big
moussed hair set. It's gloom and doom rock with plenty of angst
thrown in.
   ``Feel'' is this Los Angeles-based group's first album. It's
similar in tone to The Smiths, Joy Division or The Cure _ but on
the Despair-o-Meter, Human Drama comes out on top.
   Indovina yelps, favors a sobby vibrato, and uses the Pained
Hiccup Effect in his vocals.
   His alienated voice is alienating. His songs may have arisen
from genuinely deep pain, but it's difficult to share that pain
with him. His lyrics are mostly obscure and cryptic.
   Send in the undertakers _ or maybe a psychiatrist.
   ``So deep it burns, I burn until I cry, I die,'' Indovina sings
on ``Death of an Angel.'' Then, on ``Dying in a Moment of
Splendor,'' Indovina relates, ``I am an artist with a vision seeing
hell his destiny.'' And in ``There Is Only You,'' Indovina sings
about coming close to suicide _ though it might be just fantasy.
   So Johnny feels bad, but why?
   Is it the ozone layer? Toxic wastes? Love gone sour? Addiction?
   Indovina refers to an inner battle between Good and Evil, which
could be tied to the struggle with addiction he relates in
``Tumble'' and ``Never Never.''
   References to angels, heaven, God, demons, Easter, the Golden
Rule and prayers are sprinkled through ``Feel.'' It's too bad a
little holy water couldn't have been sprinkled, too, because this
record sounds anything but celestial.
   It takes more courage to sing about inner struggles than about
cars and girls. But Indovina lacks the directness of a Tracy
Chapman or Bruce Springsteen that makes the pain personal enough to
touch the hearts of an audience.

   ``Smoking in the Fields'' (RCA) _ The Del Fuegos
   
   The Del Fuegos color the world like autumn. Burnt orange,
russet, siena, sepia.
   On ``Smoking in the Fields,'' they sound like they've been
through the lighthearted spring and summer, and now are living in a
season where things are more serious and the winds blow harder, but
where flashes of color and cozy blankets give warmth.
   ``I'll stand by you when you're feelin' tired, gray and old;
honey I will be, too,'' Dan Zanes sings on ``Stand By You.'' The
track is the most stripped-down on the album, featuring just Zanes,
an acoustic guitar and a little help from unobtrusive strings and
backing vocals.
   Most of the rest of this album is barroom stomp rock that would
be in good company alongside Jason and the Scorchers or the LeRoi
Brothers. The Fuegos get pumped on ``Move With Me Sister'' and ``No
No Never,'' then slow down into the mid-tempo ``Part of This
Earth'' and a blues-tinted jam on ``Lost Weekend.''
   Guitars carry the tunes, and Tom Lloyd's bass is mixed up high
enough to give a weighty feel. Horns add brightness. But harmonica
work by the J. Geils Band's Magic Dick lends the most distinctive
texture to the album.
   Zanes' whiskey-over-gravel voice trademarks the stuff as the
Fuegos'.
   It's been 2{ years since the last Del Fuegos album _ the bomb
``Stand Up.'' Since then, the band has switched record labels and
producers.
   Mitchell Froom, who produced the band's first three records, is
replaced by Dave Thoener. The result, ``Smoking in the Fields,'' is
an OK rock album with a gritty tinge. But it doesn't dazzle.

<HEAD>The Artists: Learning About the World Through Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Ohio, students learned math in Japanese after
seeing a Kabuki-style ``Othello.'' In New Jersey, a teacher used
musical rhythms in a lesson on syllables. In upstate New York, a
storyteller's yarns brought a shy schoolboy out of his shell.
   All were inspired by the Lincoln Center Institute for the Arts
in Education, a program that brings a unique blend of culture,
academia and personal growth to thousands of students each year.
   ``We're not trying to teach respect or love for the arts,'' said
Mark Schubart, director of the institute. ``What we're trying to do
is more basic _ to teach about how people think and react and view
the world.''
   Each year, the institute commissions a dozen productions _
including dance, concerts and plays _ that are appropriate for
children. Teachers preview the pieces on videotape and choose one
for their school.
   What makes the program special is the involvement of artists. In
the summer, artists hold workshops at Lincoln Center to help
teachers experience the creative process and to show them how to
reach students through the arts. In the fall, the artists go into
the classroom and help teachers prepare students for the production
they'll be seeing.
   In one workshop last summer, composer John King had teachers
clap, sing and bang coffee cans to demonstrate contrapuntal
techniques.
   ``I'm not teaching them how to be musicians,'' said King. ``I'm
teaching them how to look at music by experiencing rather than
listening.''
   Gail Krehel, a second-grade reading teacher in Paramus, N.J.,
said she planned to use clapping to teach students how to divide
words into syllables.
   Last fall, elementary school students in New York City, who were
scheduled to see an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's ``Just So
Stories,'' read the book, discussed themes and characters, played
games to improve their concentration and acted out scenes to learn
what it's like to be a performer.
   ``An actor's got to change his voice and change his moving and
his body and wear different clothes,'' explained Jesus Mendez, 7.
   ``They don't look like real people when they have those things
on,'' said Aaron Tye, 5, referring to the masks worn by the ``Just
So Stories'' troupe.
   Aaron had worn a mask himself while portraying a dog during his
class's improvisations. ``I felt great. I felt like an animal,'' he
said.
   His classmate, Tavona Cooper, played a horse.
   ``She came home and told me all about it,'' said her mother,
Donna. ``She galloped around the house and showed me how the horse
moves his hoofs.''
   Cooper said she noticed a change in Tavona since those
improvisational sessions with an actress from the institute.
``She's more outgoing, more motivated now,'' Cooper said
   Tavona's teacher, Gloria Toro, explained: ``As they're learning,
their self-esteem grows because they're having so much fun and they
love what they're doing.''
   Louise Trucks of the Aesthetic Education Institute in Rochester,
which is affiliated with the Lincoln Center Institute, agreed.
   ``Children can learn things through the arts that they might not
have found in other ways,'' she said. One child reached by the
Rochester program had been a withdrawn child, not involved with
other kids in the classroom until a storyteller began visiting the
class.
   ``By the time this storyteller left, this boy was writing
stories, he was participating in the class, telling stories and
recruiting other children to do so,'' she said.
   The Lincoln Center Institute began in 1976 with a handful of
schools. Today the program reaches 100,000 children in 289 schools
in New York City, Long Island, Westchester and Rockland counties,
New Jersey and Connecticut. The schools finance half the
institute's $2.4 million annual budget. The rest is paid by private
and government grants.
   Programs modeled on the institute have sprung up in Albany,
Binghamton, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica in New York, as
well as in San Diego, Memphis and Nashville, Tenn., Tulsa, Okla.,
and other cities.
   In Bowling Green, Ohio, teachers used a Kabuki-style performance
of ``Othello'' as a springboard for lessons on Japan. ``We had
first graders doing arithmetic in Japanese,'' said director Michael
Moore.
   But the dividends are not solely academic. ``We're training kids
how to ask aesthetic questions,'' he said. ``We have third-graders
who can give critiques of plays. We have kindergarteners who will
sit through 90 minutes of a performance and not move. We're
training people to be intelligent consumers of the arts.''
   Barbara Davis of the Texas Institute for the Arts in Education
in Houston agreed. ``The children can relate to a contemporary
dance piece or an opera,'' she said. ``It's not just a bunch of
people moving around on stage anymore.''

   Who is that mad-hatted man, and what is he
doing on the radio?
   Let him speak for himself.
   ``Whooo, whooo, whooo, wind up your ears, dementites and
dementoids! It's time for the `Dr. Demento Show' with mad music and
craaaaaaaazy comedy from out of the archives and off the wall!''
Toot toot goes his toy horn, and Dr. Demento _ a.k.a. Barrett E.
``Barry'' Hansen _ is off to a nuthead start.
   ``The Dr. Demento Show,'' heard everywhere from Antarctica to
Alabama, is the only major radio outpost for wacko recordings
ranging from ``The Purple People Eater'' to early 20th century
comedy to rap-scratchin' takeoffs on ``Star Trek.''
   Every week, the show is on 193 commercial radio stations through
the Westwood One Radio Networks, and on 35 college stations and
about 500 Armed Forces Network stations on ships or bases.
   Hansen _ whose trademark is a tux and top hat _ is celebrating
20 years on commercial radio. Despite his goofy voice and
noisemakers, he calls himself a ``straight man'' to the records he
plays.
   Hansen isn't really a doctor, but if anyone were handing out
Ph.D.'s in Music of All Persuasions, he would be first in line. His
knowledge of music spans the blues, folk, classical, rock and
novelty tunes.
   He occasionally helps Casey Kasem choose old songs for ``Casey's
Top 40,'' introduced Weird Al Yankovic to the world and influences
other radio personalities.
   ``I think he's great, I love him, I've been a fan for years,''
said Scott Shannon, vice president and program director at both
Westwood One and Los Angeles' ``Pirate Radio'' (KQLZ).
   It all began when Hansen was 4 years old, just a pup in
Minneapolis. He was already fascinated by the family's gramophone
and could handle playing the fragile 78 rpm records himself.
   His father, an arts aficionado, brought home some Spike Jones
records, including ``Cocktails for Two.'' The 1945 recording starts
with a man crooning about an ``exquisite rendezvous,'' but goes
crazy with loud crashes, guns going off and people screaming
``Whoopee!''
   ``It planted the seed in my little brain which 25 years later
became the `Dr. Demento Show,''' Hansen said in an interview during
a recent visit to his alma mater, Reed College.
   When he was in junior high, he happened across a thrift shop
record sale _ two 78s for a nickel. It was the beginning of a
collection that now numbers about 250,000. ``It's not the largest
collection in the world, but it's up there,'' he said.
   He has so many records that the floor of one room in his Sherman
Oaks, Calif., home collapsed in December. Actually, contractors
told Hansen the floor should have been able to hold the records _
an estimated five tons.
   Hansen got his start in radio at Reed's station, KRRC, where he
was manager and the deejay for different shows.
   After graduating in 1963, he took off for the ``smogberry
trees'' of Los Angeles. He worked at the Ash Grove music club,
introducing such greats as Lightnin' Hopkins, Bill Monroe and Arlo
Guthrie. He did short stints as a roadie for Canned Heat and
Spirit, produced a couple of records and put together re-issues for
Specialty Records.
   Hansen also took a master's degree in folk music studies at the
University of California at Los Angeles, and wrote record reviews
for early issues of Rolling Stone magazine.
   At a party in 1970, he met two men who worked at KPPC, one of
the new FM underground, progressive radio stations that were
popping up around the country. Hansen showed them his record
collection _ then about 40,000-strong _ and was invited to do an
oldies show.
   His first time behind the mike, he played classics by Carl
Perkins, Screamin' Jay Hawkins and others, and threw in a nutty
teen car crash tune, ``Transfusion,'' by Nervous Norvus. ``Somebody
said, `You've got to be demented to play that on the radio,'''
Hansen said. The name Dr. Demento stuck.
   ``I found the most bizarre and outrageous things were the ones
that got the biggest response.'' So he gave the audience what it
wanted.
   Hansen moved to Los Angeles' KMET in 1971, went into syndication
in 1974 and watched radio change.
   When he started at KMET, DJs mixed up classical, country, jazz
and rock _ all in one show. But during the '70s, the station got
rid of all but its rock records, Hansen said. Then, management
``started telling (DJs) exactly what they had to play from those
albums, and the next step of course was putting it all on computer
programs,'' Hansen said. The same is true at most every other
commercial station.
   But Dr. Demento survived.
   He switched to Los Angeles' KLSX in 1987, where he does a live
version of his show that's sometimes wilder than the syndicated,
pre-recorded program.
   ``My show in a way is the last vestige of free-form programming
on commercial radio,'' Hansen said.
   A major source for that free form is tapes sent in by Dr.
Demento's fans, who number anywhere from 300,000 to 1 million.
   Hansen receives 20 to 30 tapes a week, most containing several
songs. Of those tapes, one or two songs will get played on the show
during that week.
   In 1976, one 16-year-old sent in a tape about the food in his
school cafeteria. That was Weird Al Yankovic, who also supplied Dr.
Demento's most exciting moment in the studio when he and friends
did a live performance of ``Another One Rides the Bus.''
   Another artist, Barnes &amp; Barnes, whose ``Fish Heads'' is Dr.
Demento's most-requested song ever, started out by submitting a
tape of ``The Vomit Song,'' which Hansen rejected. Other rejects
are tapes that are racist, libelous or obscene or that feature, for
example, 8-year-olds singing bad parodies of George Michael songs.
   Still, he said, ``I try to be outrageous.''
   Hansen is grudgingly aware of guidelines set by the Federal
Communications Commission, but as far as song selection goes, ``I
would like to have stations that are my clients ... make that
decision for me rather than the federal government,'' he said.
   A Miami station was fined for playing a song, ``Candy Rapper,''
that Hansen once played on his KLSX show. ``This is just a simple
little song about candy,'' Hansen quipped. It uses names of candy
items, such as Mounds and Big Hunk, to tell what could be an
X-rated story _ without any explicit language.
   The crowd attending Hansen's January performance at Reed went
wild for ``Candy Rapper'' and other selected hits of dementia,
including ``Dead Puppies (Aren't Much Fun),'' ``They're Coming to
Take Me Away, Ha-Haa!'' and ``Pencil Neck Geek.''
   Hansen wishes commercial radio and major record labels would
show the same enthusiasm for novelty records, which had their
heyday in the '60s. But if not, he'll continue as the King of
Novelty, making this world ``a happier place to live.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Tale of Christ Becomes Best Seller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SCHROON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Joseph Girzone's New Testament epilogue,
Christ peddles his 2,000-year-old carpentry skills for chicken
recipes, buses tables to pay his way to the Vatican and quips that
he hasn't had kosher in ages.
   And like the Christ who became a heavy tipper among the
money-changers in Jerusalem, Girzone's latter-day Jesus has radical
ideas to change humanity's relationship with God.
   Girzone's latest book is ``Joshua and the Children,'' the second
of his best-selling parable-novels about Christ's second comings _
and goings _ in today's world. Both are published by MacMillan
Publishing Co.
   ``This is my attempt to present the clear and simple message of
Jesus that's been lost over the centuries,'' Girzone, a retired
Roman Catholic priest, said in an interview at a Catholic retreat
in this Adirondack town about 100 miles north of Albany. He lives
in the Albany suburb of Altamont.
   The chief persecutors of that simple message have been churches
themselves, more intent on preserving their authority than
spreading truth, Girzone said.
   ``I see the terrible, terrible hurt, the anguish people
suffer,'' the author said. ``People are desperately trying to find
an answer, to find a god that makes sense. I want to present them
with a god that finally makes sense.''
   Religions, his own included, have failed their followers,
constructing artificial barriers and rituals that Christ wouldn't
have respected, Girzone said.
   ``Christians fighting each other in the name of Christ _ it's so
hypocritical,'' he said. ``My remedy is to plop Jesus, plop Joshua,
right in the middle of it.''
   In the first book, Jesus returns to Earth and takes the name
Joshua, setting up shop as a carpenter and wood-carver. He lives
simply, earning just enough to get by, and captivates people of all
faiths with talk of a God who forgives human weakness, who ``did
not intend to make humans little gods.''
   ``To be perfectly human, as God made us, should be our goal,''
Joshua says. ``If we appear to be religious or pious, we've missed
the point and our piety becomes a caricature and unauthentic.''
   Like Christ, Joshua clashes with the establishment. He advises a
troubled priest to fight the Catholic celibacy requirement for
priests, offends religious leaders by attending services at church
and synagogue alike, and faces a hostile panel of Vatican
inquisitors. He also annoys the pope by calling him Peter, after
the rock of an apostle on which the Catholic church was founded.
   Joshua tells Vatican leaders that churches are ``ruled by
unfeeling and arrogant shepherds who hurt the flock and do
irreparable damage to God's people with complete immunity. ... To
threaten God's displeasure when people do not follow your rules is
being a moral bully and does no service to God.''
   Girzone, 58, retired from the priesthood for health reasons in
1981 after 26 years at schools and parishes in New York City,
Pennsylvania and the Albany diocese. Too young for a church
pension, he turned to writing and lecturing to make a living.
   He self-published three books before writing ``Joshua,'' which
sold 60,000 copies under his own company's imprint, Richelieu Court
Publications. Girzone sold copies to people who came to his
lectures, and people who had read ``Joshua'' began ordering copies
to give to friends and relatives.
   ``Joshua'' made Waldenbooks' best-seller list in 1986, a rare
achievement for a self-published book. The sequel, the first
printing of which totaled 175,000 copies, broke the Top 10 of The
New York Times best-seller list.
   Collier Book s, a division of MacMillan, has sold nearly 400,000
copies of ``Joshua'' since issuing a paperback edition in 1987.
   Sales today are greater than when MacMillan published ``Joshua''
two years ago, said Barry Lippman, president of MacMillan's adult
trade division.
   ``It's not some slick fad that's caught on,'' he said. ``Within
two or three pages, there's something about the book that really
clicks with people. It shows you can have faith without thinking of
yourself as part of a church.''
   The books have become the centerpiece for Girzone's whole new
approach to Christianity, ``how you reconcile the freedom Jesus
taught with the authority of the Church,'' he said. ``I hope it
will undo some of the damage the Church has done to people.''
   Much of Girzone's vision replays Christ's saga in modern terms.
Instead of raising Lazarus from a tomb, Joshua brings a rabbi's son
back to life after he has broken his neck in a fall. Instead of
making five loaves and two fish feed a crowd after a sermon, Joshua
stretches two sandwiches to feed 25 children on a picnic. Instead
of a last supper with his disciples, Joshua is the guest at a
surprise party _ on a Thursday _ before leaving for Rome.
   In between healing the sick and restoring sight to the blind,
Joshua preaches against drugs and ocean pollution, uses TV
evangelism to get his message across and buys gallon jugs of table
wine from liquor stores.
   There's even ascension and resurrection scenes. Joshua makes a
locked-room departure in the first book from a Vatican boarding
house after telling the pope what he's doing wrong. In the second
book, Joshua vanishes from his coffin after being gunned down by
religious fanatics in Northern Ireland.
   Unlike Joshua, Girzone has drawn few harsh words for his ideas.
He's been called a ``closet Protestant'' by some conservative
Catholics, but most religious leaders say they see the truth in
what Girzone preaches.
   The ``Joshua'' stories are told simply, in artless prose
reminiscent of Christ's New Testament parables. Girzone said he
wrote simply so the story wouldn't be lost in the words.
   Before ``Joshua,'' writing had been an agony for him, Girzone
said. But the words came effortlessly for his parable of Jesus, as
if a voice whispered the words in his ear, he said.
   ``I can't help but feel God wanted something done and is using
the book to accomplish it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Downstairs a sellout crowd of 1,400 stretched
across the clattering casino, fans in cowboy boots and fancy suits
lining up to see the Oak Ridge Boys.
   Upstairs in a room overlooking the glitzy Las Vegas Strip, Duane
Allen recalled another era in this city when the Oaks on stage
outnumbered their sparse audience.
   Times change.
   ``We always required our supporting acts to go out in the
audience and help bolster the crowd,'' said Allen, a grin flashing
across his bearded face.
   ``One night we had 23 or 24 people in the audience. It was the
smallest crowd we ever worked for.''
   It's only a matter of blocks from the Landmark Hotel, where the
Oak Ridge Boys nursed a flagging career in the mid-1970s, to the
posh Celebrity Room at Bally's Resort, where they headline today.
But the difference, for their career, is immeasurable.
   ``Back in those Landmark days, we had many nights where we had
more people onstage than in the audience,'' said bass Richard
Sterban, gazing across a room that was beginning to take on a glow
as the neon-bathed Strip took life below.
   Those were the days the Oaks were trying to switch from gospel
music to country, and were having trouble finding their niche.
   The Landmark, which has since fallen on hard times and is
currently in bankruptcy, kept their hopes alive, Allen said.
   ``They took us under their wings for five years,'' he recounted.
``Working at the Landmark, for $6,000 a week, we didn't try to set
our goals too high. That place still has a good feeling for us. I
still get a chill when I walk by there. They saved our career. They
gave us work.
   ``I don't forget those times,'' Allen added. ``I've seen from
one end of the scale to the other.''
   Today they are a top attraction in a city that boasts such acts
as Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross, Wayne Newton and Barbara Mandrell.
   Now they play Vegas four or five weeks a year at more than 40
times the Landmark pay.
   Last year the Oaks played 243 dates in 113 cities, venues
ranging from state fairs to concert halls to the posh showroom at
Bally's. On a recent night at Bally's, the crowd was standing room
only.
   Joe Bonsall, wearing red tennis shoes and T-shirt to match, led
with their popular hit ``My Baby Is American Made.'' Sterban, in a
black tux, followed with ``Dream On,'' his deep bass voice sending
shudders through the sophisticated sound system.
   By the time they got to ``Y'All Comeback Saloon,'' the 1977
smash that transformed the Oaks from a gospel group to a country
hit, the sedate showroom was reverberating with the hand-clapping
fervor of a revival hall.
   Allen says these are the best of times for the Oaks _ who have
known their share of the other kind.
   The group started in Knoxville, Tenn., in 1945, borrowing the
name of the nearby atomic plant. It has had more than 40 members,
disbanding in 1946 and again in 1956. They stretched the limits of
Southern gospel music in the '60s and '70s, before such a trend was
accepted, and soon faced an identity crisis, stuck between country
and gospel, and some $100,000 in debt.
   ``Those starving days taught us not to take the prosperous times
for granted,'' said Sterban, who joined the Oaks in 1972.
   They switched to country in 1977, signed with MCA (then ABC-Dot)
and zoomed to the top of the charts with ``Y'All Come Back Saloon.''
   Since then they've had more than a dozen No. 1 country singles.
Their hit ``Elvira'' went platinum. Nine albums have gone gold and
two platinum. There have been five Grammy awards and a host of
Country Music Association awards.
   The past few years haven't been turbulence-free. There were
well-publicized differences with William Lee Golden before he split
from the group in early 1987.
   ``It was a very emotionally draining thing,'' Allen said. ``It
was an emotional strain for three years before it became public.
   ``It takes full effort to be a member of a group,'' said Allen,
who has been with the Oaks 24 years. ``If you have other interests
that draw your attention away, everybody feels that. It became very
obvious that William Lee wanted to be a solo artist. We wish him
nothing but the best.''
   The split found the group ``needing to have a breath of life
breathed into us,'' Allen said. ``It made us realize how much more
important the three of us were to each other.''
   Golden's replacement, Steve Sanders, had been a member of the
band since 1982, moving out front in the spring of 1987. Bonsall
has been with group since 1973.
   ``One of the things he's added is energy,'' Allen said of
Sanders. ``We needed to be pumped up again. The group needed some
outside influence to help create that energy.''
   The Oaks credit religious backgrounds with values they retain
today.
   ``We used to give 10 percent of our dates back to the
business,'' Allen recalled. ``We still give 10 to 15 percent to our
charity work, always have.''
   ``That's the way we were all raised, to tithe our money and our
time,'' Sterban added.
   ``I think one's religion is and should be a very significant
part of your life,'' Allen said. ``It's an integral part of the Oak
Ridge Boys. I would hate to think I'd have to go through a day or a
week or a month or a year without giving God the credit.''

   The Florence Gould Foundation has awarded a
grant of $250,000 to the American Friends of the Paris Opera &amp;
Ballet for an exhibition on Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.
   The American Friends of the Paris Opera &amp; Ballet, which was
founded in 1985 to provide support for the work of the Paris Opera,
will reopen the renovated Paris Opera Museum at the Palais Garnier
in 1991, featuring costumes, posters, photographs and personal
effects relating to the company.
   With Russian-American choreographer Michel Fokine and others,
Diaghilev founded the Ballets Russes in 1909 in Paris. The Russian
impresario's revolutionary works attracted some of ballet's top
dancers, choreographers and composers including Vaslav Nijinsky and
Igor Stravinsky.
   In recognition of the Gould Foundation, the patrons' salon at

   Bob Hover isn't sure what prompted a friend to tell him that a
deteriorating old house standing empty in Troy, Mich., would be
just right for him.
   Most likely it was because he had already turned a defunct fast
food place into a nice restaurant in Detroit, says his wife, Jenny.
   Several months later he drove by the site, and Bob Hover fell in
love with the Dunn Homestead, a late Victorian clapboard house with
gingerbread trim.
   ``I had an immediate vision of how it would look when I had
restored it,'' recalls Hover. Now more than a decade later, his
vision has been vindicated. In January, he won an award for the
renovation from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
   The Hovers' now-proud home of about 2,700 square feet has a
large living room, dining room, kitchen with new cabinets, leaded
glass cabinet fronts and a marble countertop, four bedrooms, two
full baths, a utility room and a full attic.
   From the beginning Hover, an entrepreneur and an artist, was
convinced that he had the design and physical skills necessary to
bring the house back to its former glory. His willingness to tackle
the restoration led Delores Dunn-Johnson to sell it to him.
   She and her sister, Irene Dunn-House, were born in the homestead
built by their grandfather, Terrence Dunn, in 1888. Their memories,
old photos and other materials helped the Hovers carry out the
detective work necessary to rehabilitate the home. Delores Johnson
is now the Hovers' nearest neighbor.
   When he bought the house and one acre for $40,000 in 1979, Bob
knew it was going to take a long time to rehabilitate it. ``I was
26 and single, so I didn't have to account to anyone.''
   The place had suffered substantial fire damage and had not been
lived in for years. It was, in fact, condemned by the town fire
department.
   He spent the first four years clearing away rubble, filling a
large dumpster 20 times with rubble from the site and running up a
carting bill of about $4,000.
   Town officials didn't think the house could be rebuilt and had
scheduled it for demolition. Getting a building permit took four
years and the help of the Troy Historic District Commission and the
two Dunn granddaughters.
   After the permit came through in January, 1984, Hover began the
reconstruction work. Building professionals confirmed his opinion
that virtually everything would have to be replaced. He needed new
plumbing, electrical wiring and heating as well as a new roof,
kitchen appliances and walls.
   ``All that was really left inside the house were the original
doors, some floors, some hardware and the framing,'' he recalls.
Outside, much of the trim was gone.
   He set up a woodworking shop in what are now the living and
dining rooms, spending about $12,000 on circular and band saws, an
industrial grade sander and router, and a number of hand tools.
This enabled him to make all the wood components. ``It would have
cost tens of thousands of dollars to have the work done by somebody
else.'' he says.
   He used existing woodwork--often broken--as patterns for
exterior ornamentation, wood frames and hoods for the 35 windows,
corbels, corner blocks, kitchen cabinets and newel posts for the
staircase.
   His father, Pete, who is retired, often helped him. The work was
done on weekends and most evenings from 4 to 11 p.m. Hover did all
the woodwork and painting but hired professionals to do the
plumbing and electrical work and to lay the cedar shake roof.
   The Hovers moved into the house in 1987 _ a little prematurely
they say, in something of an understatement.
   ``We didn't have a stove for seven months, and the rooms were
covered with plaster dust,'' recalls Mrs. Hover.
   ``We weathered living with wild animals, falling plaster, no
kitchen and several rooms with no floors. A typical dinner
consisted of peanut butter and sawdust sandwiches on our dining
room table saw,'' says Hover.
   In hindsight, however, his wife says the hardships have made
them feel very tied to their new home, which is now almost
complete. They are furnishing it in appropriate late Victorian
style with reproduction wallpaper, lace curtains, an old fashioned
claw-foot bathtub and pedestal sink and Victorian furniture.
   ``One of the most difficult tasks in tackling a restoration
project of this size was to secure the necessary financing.
Convincing a bank that my boarded up condemned home was just a
`fixer-upper' was almost impossible,'' says Hover. After getting a
brushoff from several local banks, Hover was finally able to secure
financing from his credit union, which advanced funds in
installments and checked on progress frequently.
   Hover says he has spent about $100,000 in addition to the
original purchase price. A local real estate broker has estimated
the property at about $170,000, he says.
   Despite, or perhaps because of, all the hard work he put into
his home, Bob Hover looks back on the past decade as fun. ``I loved
doing the work. From time to time, I would take off a night or a
weekend, and I often wondered if I would be able to bring it off.''
   This was especially so when he had to redo work. After
reconstructing a staircase, he realized it was in the wrong place.
So he ripped it out and rebuilt it in the right place.
   Every year, he documented his progress with videotape and
photos, to remind him how far he had come. ``With a project like
this you need that kind of encouragement,'' he says.

   You might not think of them as heroes, yet some of the people
who rehabilitate old buildings into homes are much like the
American pioneers who blazed a trail across new territory.
   Robert Hover wasn't daunted by the job of rehabilitating a
condemned building swaying in the wind in Troy, Mich. For his work,
he won an award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
   The stories of the Trust's 14 prizewinners and their projects
could serve as a primer on house renovation, 1990-style.
   An unusual chapter would be Todd Canterbury's story. He turned a
76-foot-high silo into a 3,100-square-foot home in Fairfax County,
Va., winning a first prize for adaptive reuse of a building.
   Robert Hodges of Baton Rouge, La., not only rescued a derelict
house and moved it to a new lot but resurrected the forgotten craft
of bousillage to recreate authentic walls of mud and Spanish moss.
   Also singled out were the restoration of a 1784 Anglo-German
stone house in Virginia; re-creation of Victorian detailing that
had been stripped from a New York City apartment; renovations to
make a home accessible for a wheelchair-bound occupant in
Philadelphia; and restoration of beautiful pine woodwork in a Texas
home _ a job took five men five months and 11 55-gallon drums of
stripper.
   ``The stories people wrote about what they did on their houses
show they had a dream of what a house could be. They did enormous
amounts of research to make their dreams come true,'' says Anne
Powell, editor of Historic Preservation, the National Trust
magazine which pictures the winning entries in its winter issue.
``There is an overall trend to be more meticulous.''
   The Trust is planning a second competition.
   The first contest brought 182 entries from 31 states. The
majority of entries (76 percent) were submitted by homeowners
themselves.
   ``The judges noticed that many of the do-it-yourself projects
could not be distinguished from projects executed by high-priced
professionals,'' says Clem Labine, one of the judges and founder of
The Old-House Journal, a publication which was at the vanguard of
the restoration trend.
   Most of the homes dated from 1880 to 1895, although the oldest
was built in 1672 and newest about 50 years ago. Economics are part
of the growing interest in preserving late 19th century homes;
earlier homes have gotten more expensive and increasingly difficult
to find, as more people covet them. Early 20th century homes have
become more desirable as the late 19th century places become more
expensive.
   ``The jewel in the rough that you could buy for $25,000 and fix
up is a thing of the past,'' says Labine. The high cost of
acquiring and redoing an old house is forcing some people to
convert them to profit-making properties, such as bed and breakfast
inns. ``The historical B&amp;B, which didn't even exist 10 years ago,
is an avenue for people who want to own an old house but can't
afford to.''
   Redoing an old home with historical accuracy is creating an
interest in architectural conservation. Many local history groups
are changing their focus from genealogy to architecture, according
to Labine.
   ``An approach we see often is for owners to renovate a building
itself with historic accuracy and furnish the interior in
contemporary fashion,'' he says. At the opposite extreme is the
period museum approach.
   ``As a rule, the more carried away you get with historical
accuracy the greater the danger of committing the cardinal sin of
real estate: overimproving,'' says Labine. ``You can spend a lot
more money in restoration than by using conventional mainstream
products from the local building center.'' But some of the benefits
of an accurate restoration are measured in quality of life rather
than dollars and cents, he says.
   As restorer of an old house and former president of the Old
Northside Neighborhood Association in Indianapolis, Ind., Paul
Smith says the appeal of living in an old house is far more than an
aesthetic appreciation for wonderful old detailing. An important
motivation is the sense of community in a neighborhood of old
houses.
   ``I can tell you the names of people who live seven or eight
blocks away. A common bond is that we are restoring an old house.
If I need a plumber, I call my neighbor for the name of one who is
sensitive to old houses,'' he says.
   The restoration trend has inspired an increase in the number of
products available to do the work. ``In 1976 there were 205
suppliers of goods or services for restoration; our current census
found 1,973 companies engaged in supplying products or services for
sympathetic rehabilitation of old houses,'' says Labine.
   And he notes preservation has become commercial because many
people prefer old or quality reproduction homes. ``The traditional
buildings are sold out, and the contemporary buildings are going
begging in the marketplace.'' - The Trust's second competition
closes June 30, 1990. For entry requirements and a nomination form,
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Home Awards, The
National Trust for Historic Preservation, 1785 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.

   Housing industry officials doubt home prices
will decline significantly in the near future, but falling mortgage
interest rates mean both the overall cost of buying a home and
monthly payments are dropping.
   The median price of a new home this year will be $127,200,
compared with $120,000 last year, according to figures compiled by
the Mortgage Bankers Association. It says the median price of an
existing home will be $96,500 in 1990, up from $92,600 in 1989.
   The median price means that half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   Some analysts say that while housing prices may be falling or
leveling off in some areas, they are not declining on a national
basis.
   Jay Shackford, a vice president of the National Association of
Home Builders, notes there are ``thousands of (housing) markets
around the country, each of which has its own dynamics driving it''
_ different economies, rates of growth, types of households _ so
that prices might be rising in some areas while falling in others.
   Overall, Shackford says, the Home Builders expect prices
nationally to increase at or slightly more than the general
inflation rate. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was up
4.9 percent at an annual rate through last November.
   ``New home prices should continue to outpace inflation, while
existing home prices should rise at about the rate of inflation,''
says David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National
Mortgage Association.
   According to John Savacool, a real estate economist with the
WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting organization, ``the
last time home prices fell at the national level was during the
Depression in the 1930s.''
   Writing in the current issue of the National Association of Home
Builders' ``Builder'' magazine, Savacool notes:
   ``Even following the stock market crash in October 1987, when
25,000 people lost their jobs in the New York area, home prices
simply went flat for a year. They did not decline on an annual
basis.''
   Other studies, however, suggest that with the aging of the baby
boom and fewer births in the subsequent baby bust era, demand for
housing will decline, causing property values to drop as well.
   But whether home prices will or will not decline, falling
interest rates are making monthly mortgage payments smaller and
thus affordable for more people.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. weekly surveys show rates for
30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped from 11.22 percent last March
to 9.78 percent by year's end.
   For a person financing a $75,000 home, a 10 percent rate
translates into monthly loan payments of about $658, compared to
about $714 for a rate of 11 percent, according to the Home Builders.
   For someone financing a $150,000 home, the lower rate reduces
total monthly prinicpal and interest payments from about $1,428 to
$1,317.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts that interest rates
will continue to drop this year to 9.4 percent on an annual basis.
Fannie Mae's Berson also expects interest rates ``to continue to
drift downward for a few more months.''
   The National Association of Realtors index measuring the ability
of a typical family to buy a home stood at 105.8 last November.
That meant that a family with a median income of $33,482 had 105.8
percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing home
costing $93,000.
   The monthly principal and interest payment to finance that home
would total about 23.6 percent of that family's income, the
Realtors said.
   Another advantage of home ownership is that the mortgage
interest payments are totally deductible from federal income taxes.
Only 10 percent of the interest on most other loans can be deducted
this year and none will be permitted in subsequent years.
   But while moderating interest rates tend to help prospective
middle-income earners, many first-time buyers are unable to qualify
financially for a typical starter home.
   The Realtors' most recent affordability index for first-time
buyers shows that during the third quarter of 1989, first-time
buyers had only 71 percent of the income needed to move from
renting to owning.
   And even if they earned enough to make the monthly payments,
many are unable to raise the 5-to-20 percent down payment now
required for many mortgages.
   The Home Builders said the home ownership rate for households in
the 25-29 age group fell from 43.3 percent in 1980 to 35.4 percent
by mid-1989, and from 61.1 percent to 53.7 percent in the 30-34 age
group.

   Bob Hover says financing was the most serious problem he faced
in his effort to rehabilitate a home in Troy, Mich.
   ``I looked into it but discovered there were no programs for
which I qualified,'' he says. ``In order to get the funding the
housing would have to be registered as a landmark.''
   According to Ian Spatz, director of the Center for Preservation
Policy Studies at the National Trust for Historic Preservation,
federal tax incentives for historic preservation exclude
owner-occupied buildings. But they do apply to rental buildings
such as bed and breakfasts or apartment buildings.
   He says that a number of states and localities offer tax breaks
or loans in connection with preservation programs, but there is no
central clearinghouse of information on these.
   ``It's up to the homeowner to call a local historic group or a
state preservation agency to inquire if any tax, grant, loan or
technical assistance programs exist at the city, county or state
level,'' says Spatz, who tracks governmental policies on
preservation as part of his job.
   One of the more popular state programs is property tax
abatement, sometimes tied to income level of occupants and
sometimes to the type of building or neighborhood, he says. This
type of help is a local option in Connecticut, Georgia, Oregon,
Washington and Illinois.
   Another typical incentive is a direct tax credit against state
income tax. In Maryland, says Spatz, localities are permitted to
offer such a tax credit, and in some owners can save 10 percent on
property taxes if they spend at least $50,000 on restoration. In
Wisconsin, a 25 percent tax credit is available, and Colorado is
considering a similar guideline, he says. A state income tax saving
is also available in New Mexico and Rhode Island.
   In each state, restrictions are made according to the type of
building and nature of the work. Standards usually allow changes
for new use but require retention of basic historic features. In
many localities, the building must be located within a historic
district and be listed with the National Register of Historic
Places. There are 700,000 buildings within national register
historic districts, says Spatz.
   ``I am not aware of any program that gives you an incentive for
just purchasing a historic building. The incentives are all geared
to fixing them up,'' he says.
   In some localities, preservation organizations have loan
programs. A North Carolina group, for example, uses a fund to buy
historic places in danger of demolition and sells them to people
who want to fix them up. A sweat equity program in New Orleans
makes it possible for people who are willing to restore a building
to own it. The city's Preservation Resource Center works with local
banks to arrange financing, according to Spatz.
   Information, if not funding, is widely available to those who
choose to rehabilitate an old building. The Old-House Journal is a
monthly magazine which covers most aspects of buying, restoring and
owning an old house. Call 1-800-888-9070.
   The U.S. Department of the Interior publishes the ``Catalog of
Historic Preservation Publications'' which lists government
pamphlets and books of interest to restorers of old houses. It's
free and available from the Department's Preservation Assistance
Division, 1100 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20013. The National
Trust, a private nonprofit organization supported by private funds,
membership dues and some government funding, is one of the first
places to turn for information. Members receive a monthly
newsletter and bimonthly magazine and reduced fees for programs.
   The National Trust answers telephone queries on old house
restoration, conducts workshops and seminars all over the country
and can put you in touch with preservation organizations in your
area. Write to the group at 1785 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20036; phone: 202-673-4000.
   Often the first question a prospective owner has concerns the
property itself. The first step should be a complete deed or title
search in the county's records.
   For urban areas, Sanborn maps that date back to 1867 can be
invaluable. Copies of these maps are often found in libraries and
historical societies, which sometimes also can identify other
sources of local historic information or old photographs that are
helpful in reconstruction, says the Trust.
   Look in the public library for how-to books on all aspects of
old houses. Local landmark commissions often have information on
buildings and districts under their jurisdictions, and local
newspapers may have old stories about fires involving the
properties or obituaries of former owners.

   The blue and mauve exterior is the icing on the cake for Bob
Hover, who spent ten years rescuing an 1888 house in Troy, Mich.,
from demolition.
   He used three shades of blue and two of the mauve from a paint
company's historic Victorian color line. Colors such as these once
might have been considered garish. But these days bright colors on
an old building are fashionable.
   The trend for colorful houses started in San Francisco in the
1970s and now has moved all over the country, according to
Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen, whose 1978 book, ``Painted
Ladies,'' documented its beginnings.
   ``The color movement isn't funded or directed by anyone; it has
grown because people love the look of the painted houses,'' says
Pomada. Paint, which has saved many old structures by making them
look better and increasing their value, even has played a role in
the revival of such towns as Cape May, N.J., Port Townsend, Wash.,
and Ferndale, Calif., say these writers, who recently published a
new book, ``How to Create Your Own Painted Lady'' (Dutton).
   This view is endorsed by historian Roger Moss, whose specialty
is American 19th century culture. Moss is co-author of a how-to
book, ``Victorian Exterior Decoration: How To Paint Your 19th
century American House Historically'' (Henry Holt &amp; Co.).
   ``The cheapest thing you can do to upgrade a single house, a
whole block or a town is to paint it. Paint is what gives historic
districts continuity and many communities are adopting color
guidelines,'' says Moss, who has advised towns on appropriate
colors.
   In Bridgeton, N.J., one of his clients, paint led to housing
renewal. Since 1983, this south Jersey town has been giving free
paint and custom color schemes developed by Moss to low-income
residents of deteriorating 19th century homes. Several hundred
homes have been painted, according to Raymond Maier, director of
community development.
   ``Property values are up and for sale signs are down,'' says
Maier, who sees the paint as a catalyst for housing rehabilitation
and a new attitude of pride. ``People see their old houses as
charming antiques instead of white elephants and have gotten
interested in making repairs to roofs and furnaces.'' The town
requires authentic colors from an extensive choice of hues.
   The ``painted ladies'' aren't really new. Historical research
has disclosed that Americans of earlier times often did paint their
homes in bright colors. Today, some people prefer to select these
historically authentic colors, while others please themselves.
   As a historian, Moss says that the special ``historic'' colors
offered by paint companies are not necessarily accurate: ``Most of
them have deviated pretty far from historical documents.''
   But there are good matches in their regular lines, says Moss. He
has found acceptable current substitutes for 34 old paint colors by
comparing the old and new paint charts of Sherwin-Williams,
Benjamin Moore, Glidden and Devoe. There also may be many other
paint lines with appropriate colors.
   ``You don't have to pay for special paints or hire an expert to
get an authentic paint scheme. You just have to know a bit about
historic colors and if you do minimum research, you will find that
out,'' Moss says.
   Hover, who removed layers of paint during the renovation,
considered a chemical analysis to learn what the original house
color had been but found it too expensive. Earlier coats of blue,
violet and bright yellow had all blended together by the time he
began removing them by hand-sanding.
   His interest in selecting a historically accurate color scheme
is quite typical of homeowners today, says New York paint dealer
Neil Janovic. ``Consumers today crave authenticity. Even though you
could duplicate the colors from the regular line, the historic
lines are popular because the label adds peace of mind,'' according
to Janovic.
   It would be impossible to exactly match the colors of the past
because environmental regulations prohibit the use of some
pigments, Moss points out. A number of states are considering new
regulations which Janovic says could severely curtail the
availability of oil-based paints.
   Hover chose oil-based paints for his home. He applied three
coats of a top-grade paint, a white prime coat as a base, a second
prime coat in blue and a third coat of finish paint. Although the
oil-based paint is harder to work with than water-based paint, he
thought it would last longer. (This is disputed by some paint
manufacturers.)
   He had satin-finish and semigloss formulations mixed
half-and-half to get the degree of shine he wanted. He estimates
cost at about $25 a gallon and that it took from 20 to 30 gallons
to cover the house with three coats. Working evenings and weekends,
it has taken him two years to paint the exterior. ``I am still
painting.'' he adds.

   The hottest home-buying market today is keyed to the ``move-up''
buyer, the home-owner seeking larger, more luxurious and
comfortable housing, according to a survey conducted by Better
Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service.
   ``Finding a home that adequately suits a family's changing
lifestyle is one of the main motivations behind the move-up rush,''
says Alen Sabbag, president of the real estate service.
   ``This accelerating trend is making larger, more expensive
single-family homes and three-bedroom city condos _ homes that fit
the lifestyle and income levels of one out of every three American
households counted as part of the baby boom generation _ the
nation's most hotly-pursued market,'' he says.
   According to the survey, 57 percent of home buyers in 1988 fit
the category of ``move-up'' buyers.
   A National Association of Home Builders report says 66 percent
of all home construction is geared to the ``move-up'' market.
   These buyers are choosing ``neo-traditionalism'' in their
housing, says Joan McCloskey, executive building editor of Better
Homes and Gardens magazine.
   ``They want a traditional exterior, including a return to the
porch, but a contemporary interior, with special attention aimed at
the entry,'' she says.
   They also seek more space and bigger rooms, she says, which
``can also mean more lighting within rooms and ceiling heights
rising to nine feet and higher.''
   Among other elements: a kitchen with large pantries and open
access to the family room and the outdoors; master suites with
walk-in closets, sitting areas and built-in electronics; a ``media
wall'' in the family room, and better location, closer to good
schools, work and public and health care facilities.

   Regional history influences the popularity of home styles
throughout the United States, says a New York-based home building
and remodeling magazine.
   According to Practical Homeowner, the architectural style of a
house can affect its value by as much as 15 percent.
   A survey of real estate industry professionals indicates that
traditional, classically styled homes are good investments because
they have a higher resale value and are easier to sell, the
magazine reports.
   Many of those polled said homes with hard geometric lines, made
primarily with concrete, glass and steel, were trendy a few decades
ago but seem dated and faddish to today's typical buyer.
   ``The English tradition is strong in the eastern United States
because that is the style that was prevalent when the region was
settled,'' the publication adds. ``Similarly, Southern California
and Florida were first colonized by the Spanish, so Spanish style
is strong there.''
   The survey showed that New Englanders prefer the traditional
English center hall colonial, typically two stories and made of
wood. The estimated added value of that style was 10-15 percent.
   In the mid-Atlantic and southern states, the favorite style is
the neoclassic brick colonial typical of Williamsburg, with an
added value of 5 percent.
   Other prevalent regional styles, with estimated added value:
   _ Florida and Southern California: Spanish, with white stucco
walls and tiled roofs, 0-5 percent.
   _ Midwest and parts of Texas: a traditional mix of Tudor,
French, Victorian farmhouse and colonial, 3-10 percent.
   _ Southwest (New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada): adobe, 5-15
percent.
   _ Plains and mountain states: conventional split-level
contemporary with wood siding, 1-3 percent.
   _ Northwest: transitional, woodsy, with touches of Victorian and
craftsman style, 5 percent.

   You could make more work and storage space in your present home
by thinking twice: Can the area serve more than one purpose, and is
there available vertical ``air'' space?
   Even a small kitchen usually can accommodate a multi-purpose
spot for household paperwork and meal planning, according to Better
Homes &amp; Gardens' Remodeling Ideas magazine.
   And consider wallspace and doorspace in addition to floorspace,
advises Judith Miley, spokeswoman for Clairson International,
makers of closet and storage systems. You may have more cubic
footage available than you realize.
   The key to working out a multi-purpose work space is to figure
out which tasks are done regularly and base the design on those
needs.
   If you cook and entertain frequently, then you probably can use
a desk for meal planning and shelves deep enough for cookbooks. The
same area can double as a family message, study and computer
center, complete with wall-mounted cabinets, shelving, bins,
wallphone, stationery and books.
   You might choose a flat display rack similar to those in stores
if many of the cookbooks are in large formats. A stacked desk and
shelf combination for the personal computer might be the best
choice if you manage household accounts on a PC. Keep in mind that
reading and writing by hand require a desk height of about 30
inches, while a a computer or typewriter keyboard should be on a
surface about 26 inches high.
   Also provide a stable power source for the computer, which can
lose its memory or scramble your work during power surges caused by
use of other appliances or temporary electrical outages. Power
strips or boxes with fused protection against electrical surges and
spikes, available in hardware and electronics stores, can be
mounted easily to existing outlets.
   Use overhead shelves to store small equipment and other items
you need frequently but want out of the way. A cork bulletin board
mounted next to the wall phone will cut down desktop clutter.
   Miley suggests you analyze each room for inventive ways to make
better use of the space you have.
   Your bathroom linen closet could be turned into a miniature
laundry with a compact, stackable washer-dryer (since it's often
right on plumbing mains), then linens can be accommodated on
wall-running shelves in the bathroom or with tiered shelves in part
of a nearby closet outside the room. If you are replacing the tub,
consider putting the new one on a platform, with storage drawers in
the platform step.
   While you can maximize cubic footage for storage as part of a
renovation project, there still are ways to reorganize your
existing space without rebuilding, Miley says. She suggests using
stacking shelves, double-hanging shelf-and-rod combinations,
vertical dividers, wall-to-wall shelving, or even automated
revolving retrieval systems, which her company markets under the
Closet Maid and Keiji trademarks. Most of these pieces are based on
coated metal wire, with wood and laminates.
   You also can find useable kitchen space by suspending cookware
and lightweight plants from ceilings where there isn't traffic, or
hanging shallow, coated-wire bins in existing shelving. Put tiered
shelves in previously unused corners.
   You can make space by mounting shoe shelves on closet walls or
on the interior sides of the closet doors. Shallow shelves and
coathooks also can be mounted on doors.
   Remember safety and convenience. Plan storage of heavy items
between knee and shoulder height, glide-out cabinet organizers for
better visibility and access, mobile storage pieces for use as
carts to transport appliances, food or tableware to other rooms,
and adequate lighting throughout.

   Insulation can do more for your house than just reduce
temperature transfer _ it can make it quieter.
   Fiber glass can absorb airborne sound like television audio or
voices, or conductive sound that moves through the house structure
from machines, plumbing or footsteps, according to Frank Glover of
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation.
   ``The inner walls and ceilings in most homes do not muffle noise
well,'' says Glover. ``To block sound transmission, low-density
materials such as fiber glass insulation can be installed inside a
wall or ceiling.''
   Glover advises homeowners to insulate interior walls and ceiling
during new home construction or during remodeling. The insulation
should be installed and held in place with resilient channels _
metal strips that break the path of vibration. When finishing the
wall, drywall should be fastened to the joists using resilient
channels. Caulk any wall-to-floor and wall-to-ceiling joints that
are not taped.
   Openings that have been bored into the walls for plumbing or
heating pipes should be plugged to keep sound from traveling
through. Stuff larger openings with unfaced fiber glass insulation
and patch smaller cracks and openings with silicone caulking.
   Glover advises the homeowner not to clamp pipes tightly to
framing but to line the clamps with spongy materials like neoprene
washers. Where pipes run out through finished surfaces, infill with
flexible sealers.
   Duct systems for air conditioners or heating systems also should
be insulated to decrease operating noise.
   And finally, thick, well-padded carpets or a sound-deadening
board installed between floor and underlayment will absorb noise in
the room and reduce its transmission to a room below.

<HEAD>Homes: Floor Refinishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Floors may take the hardest abuse of any part of your home, but
you can refinish them yourself, armed with some basic knowledge
about woods and stains.
   Here are some tips about floors for do-it-yourselfers from
Fabulon Products, which makes wood finishes:
   _ To remove stains, cross-sand the stained area, then sand with
the grain. Heavy stains may need bleach. Deep discoloration caused
by water damage or pet urine may call for board replacement or
coverage with a dark stain.
   _ Bleached areas may not blend perfectly, but using a light wood
stain over the floor may help.
   _ If you need to match a repair but don't know what kind of
finish is on your floor, scrape off a sample and send it to a lab
for testing. If in any doubt, you may want to remove all the old
finish.
   _ To find out if your floor had been pre-finished with wax,
scrape near the edges for evidence of wax buildup. Or apply ammonia
and let it stand; if it turns white, wax is present.
   _ If a floor has been maintained with wax, the only way to
prepare it for refinishing is to remove all the old finish by
sanding. If you don't want to refinish the floor, try blending worn
spots with more wax.
   _ You don't necessarily have to remove all the old finish to
maintain the floor. If the finish hasn't been worn down to the bare
wood and is free of wax and grease buildup, all you need to do is
sand with 100-grit or finer sandpaper, vacuum thoroughly, and
recoat. Most floors can be recoated up to six times before complete
removal is needed.
   _ You usually can rent power equipment to carry out a
refinishing project. These will include a drum sander, a disc edge
sander and an industrial vacuum cleaner. Average cost is around $50
per day. Sandpaper sheets cost about $2.25, discs 85 cents. Rental
stores will usually allow you credit on unused sandpaper, so be
sure to ask for enough. Coarser grades last longer than fine-grit
papers, which need to be changed regularly.
   _ The average floor _ 10 feet by 12 feet, or 150 square feet _
takes about five hours to sand and coat. Let the first coat of
finish dry overnight before applying the second coat. Let the floor
dry for 24 to 36 hours before replacing furniture.
   _ Pick finishes appropriate to use. Clear acrylics work well in
bedrooms and living rooms, dry quickly without strong odor and can
be applied over existing coats, new wood, or a primer-sealer.
Polyurethanes take longer to dry and do not blend or patch well,
but they produce a hard finish and can be used in bedrooms, living
rooms, kitchens and baths.
   _ You can sand a pre-finished floor one or two times and a
three-quarter-inch oak or pine floor about six times before
replacement. Each sanding will remove about one thirty-second of an
inch of wood.
   The company recommends keeping your floor in good condition with
regular vacuuming and damp mopping with clear water when needed,
using water sparingly. A cloth dampened with mineral spirits will
remove heel marks. To renew the luster, damp mop with a mixture of
white vinegar and water (six ounces of vinegar to a gallon of
water).

   Windows are one of the main architectural elements in a house,
and affordable stock windows in many styles that once were only
custom-made can wake up its design, according to House Beautiful
magazine.
   Window design and location ``have everything to do with the
success or failure of a building,'' says Christopher Williams, a
Meredith, N.H., architect, in an article carried in a recent issue
of the magazine.
   Because of the wide choice available, you can take advantage of
new window technology without compromising architectural integrity.
   Replacement options include style, price, energy efficiency and
maintenance. When remodeling, window size and location also need to
be taken into account.
   Most architects advocate respect for period and style, but New
York architect Walter Chatham warned against rigidity.
   ``The character of the house should guide your choice of
windows, but if the house lacks character entirely, you can
compensate _ through the windows you choose,'' he says.
   There are fanlight windows, eyebrows, oriels, bays _ all in
standard sizes. Use special shapes only with careful attention to
placement, detail and period.
   A view _ having something pleasing to look at and a good way to
see it _ is not only an important amenity. It can be a valuable
improvement.
   Boston architect Douglas Lemle suggests exploring ``how you are
continuously connected to the outdoors. It's not just a view but
also the sequence of what your eyes are focusing on as you move
through your house.''
   Planning a view involves furniture arrangements. What will you
be able to see from where you sit _ or stand. At what time of day?
   Thoughtful window expansion not only stretches your view but
also increases the natural light in your home.
   ``The effect of the light from skylights can be spectacular,''
Lemle says, but warns they can create glare.
   Installing a small skylight in a corner rather than a large one
in the center of a room will let the light bounce off corner walls,
suffusing it across the area.
   Design professionals suggest placing windows on two walls of a
room, with the glass area adding up to at least 10 percent of floor
area.
   The direction of light affects energy conservation. West-facing
windows tend to produce a lot of heat. The general rule is to
reduce the amount of glass on the side of the house that's most
exposed to heat gain.
   If your view is westward, window shades, exterior awnings, roof
overhangs and trellises can help reduce heat. Chatham says placing
windows high up on a wall can ``light a big area with a small
amount of glass.''
   Glass is available with a low-emissivity (low-E) coating, with
argon gas injected between layers, or with both.
   Industry sources say that low-E glazing has an R3 value, while
windows with both low-E coating and argon gas perform at R4. That
means four times the energy efficiency of single-thickness glass.
   High-tech products are not the only answer. Williams says his
New England architectural practice often requires him to provide
natural summer cooling.
   ``Casements direct ventilation just as sails do, to the point
where breezes can actually be made to flow through a building,'' he
says.
   Before you buy, compare the qualities of products from different
window makers _ and ask for expert assistance.
   ``Specifications vary from manufacturer to manufacturer,'' New
York City architect Laurence Tamaccio told Judith Trotsky in House
Beautiful. ``You can't ask too many questions.''

   What do a medieval cathedral, a storm door in Rhode Island, a
shower stall in Arizona and a light fixture in Missouri share in
common?
   The answer: stained glass.
   The ancient craft of making colored glass, cutting it into
pieces to make intricate designs, then framing the pieces with
heated lead began in Europe in the Middle Ages.
   Today, there are few practitioners of this medieval craft. But a
modern version of stained glass is available to homeowners through
a patented overlay system that uses everyday or tempered glass
already in place.
   ``It's bringing new light, color, attractive custom-design
patterns and even a substantial boost in resale value to homeowners
around the nation and in 21 other countries,'' says William Slippy
Jr., executive vice president of Stained Glass Overlay of Irvine,
Calif.
   The process starts by positioning the desired design, on paper,
on one side of a glass section, then cementing flexible lead strips
into place by hand on the other, following the design lines.
   Colored coverings _ translucently thin but durable _ are razored
to fit, then cemented into place. This material can be textured or
smooth.
   The new system, Slippy says, has led to an international
franchise network of artisans who can create and install a
customized stained glass overlay in a few days rather than weeks.
   One of the artisan-entrepreneurs _ Don Mitchell of St. Charles,
Mo. _ points out that an in-home light fixture made by the original
stained glass method would weigh about 80 pounds.
   ``We can create the same decorative fixture with the same
design, and it weighs eight pounds,'' Mitchell says.

   The hearth is the soul of the house, where the family gathers
for food, warmth and fellowship, according to tradition.
   While it's a bit hard to envison the family gathered around the
microwave in these electronic days (a nice evening by the fire in
five minutes), the stove _ or whatever is used to boil, broil, fry,
bake, or toast _ is still the centerpiece of a kitchen.
   One variation on the stove is the cooktop, a combination of
burners, grills and controls in a horizontal panel, often installed
in island counters. An example is a new gas downdraft cooktop from
Modern Maid, which features interchangeable cartridges for double
burners, griddle and rotisserie in addition to its grill. All
surfaces are Teflon-coated, and the unit has formed burner bowls to
catch boil-overs. The new model, PGT 193, replaces the earlier KGT
693, which the company says was the first gas downdraft cooktop in
the industry.
   Ovens and cooking appliances that suspend under shelves may be a
good choice for small or galley-style kitchens. The Spacemaker
series from Black &amp; Decker includes under-the-cabinet models of
toaster oven@broilers, automatic drip coffee makers, a hot-air
popcorn center, and a can opener. Compact countertop models of the
toaster oven@broiler and the combination microwave and traditional
oven and toaster also work in limited space.
   For Anglophiles and those with classic tastes, there is the Aga
II, a scaled-down version of the well-known British four-oven stove
(called a cooker in Britain) that has been created for the American
market. The Aga II has two ovens, uses continuous radiant heat
(from natural gas, liquid propane or coal) and can simultaneously
broil, roast, simmer, bake, fry, stew, toast, boil and grill. And
yes, it has the front rail for drying towels. The cooker weighs 900
pounds in cast iron, is hand made and hand enameled in a number of
colors. The stove is custom-assembled at the consumer's home.
   Modern Maid and Black &amp; Decker products are widely available in
stores. For information about Aga II dealers, contact AGA Cookers
of North America in Stowe, Vt., (802) 253-9727.

   If you're having a problem with a major appliance, you may be
tempted to just throw it out and buy a new one.
   Don't be hasty, advises the Major Appliance Consumer Action
Panel. If you contact an authorized service agency or the customer
relations office of the manufacturer, you may save money and hassle
and in some cases even have the appliance replaced.
   The panel suggests you first re-read the use and care booklet
and check the appliance's plug, fuses, pilots and controls. You may
discover the problem yourself.
   Once you're sure the problem is with the appliance, contact an
authorized service agency for a written diagnosis of the problem, a
list of parts required for repair, and an estimate of costs for
both parts and labor.
   Then write to the manufacturer's customer relations office,
usually listed in the use and care booklet which comes with the
appliance. Describe the complaint clearly and include copies of the
service agency's diagnosis, along with proof of purchase, and model
and serial numbers. Tell the manufacturer what you think is a
reasonable solution. Be sure to include your address and a daytime
telephone number, along with copies of service receipts and
correspondence relating to the repair.
   If you're still not satisfied, then contact MACAP, a volunteer
mediation group made up of industry professionals and sponsored by
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. The panel will
review your complaint, contact the manufacturer again and recommend
a non-binding solution when appropriate. The panel is at 20 North
Wacker Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606

   Wood, one of the world's oldest building materials, is aging
well.
   Processes to improve its wearing and weathering qualities and a
new appreciation of its natural insulating qualities contribute to
its continued popularity as a building and remodeling material.
   The trade association for makers of wood windows and doors as
well as suppliers of pressure-treated wood for outdoor use both
report healthy and growing sales, despite the fact that housing
starts dropped in l988.
   ``Because of its honeycomb-shaped cell structure, wood is a
natural thermal insulator containing a high percentage of
insulating-rich air within the wood fibers,'' points out John W.
Shoemaker of the National Wood Window and Door Association, which
reported a 20 percent rise in sales last year.
   The association's research on wood doors showed that wood
expands and contracts less than steel during temperature changes,
thus maintaining a tighter fit with weatherstripping.
   Wood's aesthetic quality also contributes to its popularity,
Shoemaker adds.
   Woods to be used outdoors, such as in decks and patios, are in
higher demand because more Americans spend leisure time outdoors.
According to a Better Homes and Gardens Consumer Panel survey, 50
percent say they are doing more entertaining outdoors. ``Americans
are snatching up new products which help to create more interesting
and useful outdoor environments where they spend their time,'' says
John Cashmore, Weyerhaeuser LifeWood Program manager. Among these
are pre-turned millwork in a variety of styles that can be used in
building decks and other structures. Decorative spindles, railings,
lattice panels, finials and posts have notches and grooves that
make assembly easy.
   The most durable woods proabably are those treated under
pressure with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) to resist fungus,
mildew, and termites. CCA penetrates the wood, creating a molecular
bond that prevents leaching and chemical seepage. Some care is
needed in handling pressure-treated wood, which has come under
Environmental Protection Agency scrutiny for potential hazards due
to the arsenic. EPA advises sawing the wood outdoors; using a
dustmask; washing thoroughly before eating, drinking or smoking;
washing workclothes separately; and to dispose of scraps by burial
or landfill trash collection instead of burning. The agency
recommends not using the wood for for kitchen, livestock feeders or
food storage projects.
   Treated wood needs some maintenance, such as cleaning and
preserving, to protect against weathering.
   A deck cleaner like Cuprinol's Revive can be used to pre-treat
wood before staining or preserving. Or use a 50@50 solution of
household bleach and water. Then apply stains or preservatives.
DAP, which makes many of these, recommends saturating wood surfaces
for maximum protection.
   If you're got damaged old wood, you might try Mr. Mac's
Wood-Fix. Used wih fiber glass cloth, this polymer-based substance
can repair and rebuild splintered, rotted, chipped, blistered and

   Outdoor lights can dramatize your house and yard, letting you
enjoy your garden or pool for longer periods during the day while
increasing security.
   You can set up a lighting design of your own by using one of the
new low-voltage lighting kits that contain all the essentials _
stake or mounted fixtures, transformer, cords and switches. One
maker of the kits, Toro, has some advice about getting the most
pleasing and professional-looking results:
   _ First, draw a scale plan of your yard on graph paper, showing
location of paths or walks, gardens, statuary and the house. Note
any architectural details you'd like to play up, or utility areas
you want to play down. Identify focal points and lines of sight you
want to emphasize. Then note where you think fixtures will do the
best highlighting.
   _ Using the graph as a guide, set up the equipment and test it
at night. Fine-tune the result by moving the fixtures until you're
satisfied with the mood and effect.
   _ Lights can add depth to a shallow yard if you use brighter
lights near the house and dimmer lights in the distance.
   _ Uplighting _ shining lights up into trees and bushes _ is best
for creating emphasis and mood. Downlighting, while not as
dramatic, serves double-duty for functional lighting in access
areas such as paths and drives. Moonlighting _ shining a light down
from high in a tree _ can diffuse light over a large area.
   _ In most cases, cords need not be buried for safety, though for
appearance you may want to conceal them in a shallow trench or
cover them with gravel or wood chips. Cords should be buried under
the turf where you may be mowing grass.
   The company's kits contain parts designed to snap together
without tools, and you can begin with a starter kit and add on
later. Fixtures come in durable plastics or redwood, with stakes to
position them in the ground or mounts for trees and buildings. The
weatherproof low-voltage equipment is safe, economical and delivers
both dim and bright lighting, Toro says. Optional features include
timers or photoelectric sensors to turn the systems on
automatically, motion detectors, wired and wireless remote
controls, and indoor security alarms.
   Basic kits cost about $50; Toro estimates cost of an average
installation at about $200.

   With the luxury of having your own pool comes the responsibility
of making sure the water isn't contaminated.
   Signs of contamination are easy to spot, but they may not be
what you expect, says Randy Redd, a Du Pont chemical engineer.
``Most people think that if they can small chlorine, the water is
clean. But a strong chlorine odor is the smell of chloramines _ the
contaminated part of water. Chloramines are the chemical result of
the reaction between chlorine and organic contaminants.''
   That heavy chlorine smell, or water that irritates your eyes or
is cloudy, signals contamination.
   Common contaminants are suntan oil, sweat, rain, leaves and
other windblown debris that may find their way into the water.
   Redd, whose company makes Impact, a monosulfate used in making
oxygen-based speed shocks for treating water, recommends
maintaining your pool every two weeks. Repeat the maintenance
routine any time there has been heavy use or heavy rain, or when
the warning signs are present. Oxygen-based ``shocking'' can be
done quickly with pool water ready for swimming within 15 minutes.
The shocks should be used in conjunction with normal sanitizing and
algae control.
   In contrast, he says, with chlorination it may be eight to 10
hours before the pool can be used. It also needs elaborate, precise
calculation to administer, since insufficient chlorine can make the
water dirtier. And that makes it such a chore that many pool owners
only handle it a few times a year.

   If you're restoring or renovating an older house, you can use
modern lighting in authentic reproductions of period lamps that
will blend with the architecture and decor. Rejuvenation Lamp &amp;
Fixture Company offers a catalog service of fixtures with designs
dating from the 1800s to the l930s. The new catalog features
turn-of-the-century Sheffield designs, with stamped metal parts and
glass shades made from original molds recently discovered by the
company's president, Jim Kelly. The company has supplied fixtures
for historic rehabilitation projects such as the Old Executive
Office Building and Union Station in Washington and Ellis Island.
For a catalog, write to Rejuvenation at 901 N. Skidmore, Portland,
Ore. 97217. _
   Women and people over the age of 60 are buying 40 percent of all
snowthrowers, according to research by Toro, which makes one brand
of the power appliance. Older people who choose to remain in the
snow belt after retirement recognize the difficulty and health
risks of shoveling snow, says Tom Swain, the company's snowthrower
marketing manager, ``but they don't want to give up their
independence during winter months to snow removal services.''
Similarly, single women homeowners, who account for 10 percent of
homes purchased, don't want to be at the mercy of such services.
Swain says he thinks women are tougher customers than men because
they expect higher quality and value. Both seniors and women ask
more questions and are more interested in how the product performs,
he adds. _
   Consumers are doing more of their own home improvement and
remodeling jobs and they are buying better quality tools and
accessories to do them, a new survey shows. One third of the
participants in the Better Homes &amp; Gardens Consumer panel, made up
up 1,000 members demographically representing the magazine's
readers, said they are doing more _ and more complex _ projects
than they were doing two years ago. Some of these projects are room
additions and electrical and plumbing work. A majority said they
are willing to pay more for better tools. The survey was sponsored
by the Irwin Company, a power and hand tool manufacturer. _
   If you keep a refrigerator or freezer on your back porch, in the
garage, or any other normally unheated area, you may want to pick a
manual defrost model.
   Automatic defrosting systems can be thrown for a loop when the
surrounding, or ambient, temperature drops below 60 F, according to
the Major Appliance Consumer Action Panel. At this temperature, the
compressor will not operate long enough to maintain adequate cold
in the freezer compartment. That's because compressor operation
decreases when the outside temperature falls. At about 38 F to 42
F, the compressor will not run at all, so frozen food can defrost
and spoil. _
   You can get year-round, all-day use of swimming pool, spa, or
hot tob by enclosing it in a greenhouse, points out Four Seasons,
the makers of greenhouses and solariums for the home. The company
says that a typical 10-by-16 feet greenhouse would cost between
$10,000 to $15,000, fully installed. A greenhouse also acts as a
passive solar heat collector, offsetting heating costs. _
   Exposures' Catalog offers a new framing-by-mail service that the
company says is an affordable alternative custom framing. Frames
are shipped fully assembled, ready for your artwork or photo to
slip into an easy-entry back. For a catalog, call 1-800-222-4947. _
   A new externally-mounted sidewall venting system for gas- and
oil-fired appliances and heating systems can cut construction costs
by eliminating the need for a chimney, according to its
manufacturer, Field Controls Company. The firm says the venting
unit increases fuel efficiency and can cut chimney heat loss by as
much as 45 percent. _
   California houses are for the most part mechanically and
structurally sound, though many need seismic straps for water
heaters and spark arrestors on chimneys, according to a survey by
Property Inspection Service, a franchise network of home inspection
offices based in San Jose. The organization surveyed 30,000 homes
in the state and found that 77 percent need a water heater strapped
for earthquake safety and 60 percent need spark arrestors on a
chimney. ``We have excellent construction standards in this state,
so typically the only problems we see when inspecting homes are
those resulting from deferred maintenance and the natural life
cycle of building components,'' says Ben Vitcov, founder and
president of the service. _
   If your wooden kitchen cabinets look a bit grubby, then consider
a tune-up. Kitchen Tune-Up of Aberdeen, S.D., will take them
through a nine-step, three-hour process, costing from about $60 to
$90, to revitalize them. All surface hardware is removed, nicks and
scratches are touched up, bumper pads are put on each door, doors
are adjusted for height, and hinges and drawer slides are
lubricated. The surfaces are then buffed before existing or new
hardware is re-attached. Countertops also will be buffed and
cleaned. _
   ``Consumer Selection Guide for Room Air Conditioners'' and
``Consumer Selection Guide for Refrigerators and Freezers'' are
available for $1.50 each from the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers at 20 North Wacker Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606. Each
guide includes general instructions and advice for buyig these
appliances and a comprehensive model-by-model energy rating list. _
   Design Spirit, a new magazine devoted to conservation-oriented
design and building, made its debut with a winter-spring issue in
January. The magazine, published in Brooklyn. N.Y., will spotlight
architects, artists, designers, and craftsmen whose work shows
sensitivity to environmental issues. _

   The U.S. economy slowed almost to a standstill
in the last three months of 1989, registering a barely perceptible
0.5 percent annual growth rate that was the poorest since the
spring of 1986.
   The Commerce Department on Friday blamed the big drop-off in
growth from October through December on a rare decline in consumer
spending, a deteriorating trade deficit and a slump in business
investment spending.
   For the year as a whole, the GNP grew by 2.9 percent, following
a much more rapid 4.4 percent increase in 1988. It was the slowest
annual growth rate since a 2.7 percent rise in 1986.

   The dollar fell against other major currencies in
light European trading this morning as support from political
unrest in Eastern Europe evaporated. Gold prices rose.
   The dollar had been boosted in recent weeks by the Eastern
European unrest, with investors turning to the American currency as
a safe haven in times of political turmoil. But investors now are
beginning to refocus their attention on fundamental factors in the
market, dealers said.
   Traders predicted the dollar would fluctuate in a narrow range,
but they said the possibility of a decline in interest rates in the
United States, combined with talk of higher interest rates in Japan
and West Germany, could send the dollar lower in the short run.
   ``It's a very fragile market, and there's still room on the
downside,'' one Milan trader said.
   Another said: ``There's a sense of waiting. It still isn't clear
what the market wants to do.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 143.22 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6725 West German marks, down from 1.6935;
1.4822 Swiss francs, down from 1.4975; 5.6840 French francs, down
from 5.7510; 1.8855 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9060; 1,245.75
Italian lire, down from 1,260.00; and 1.1885 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1903.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6775 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6571 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $420 a troy ounce, up
from $418.75 dollars bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $420.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.60, up from $418.50 bid late
Friday.

<HEAD>CenTrust Chief Assails Actions Against Thrift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of CenTrust Savings Bank blames political
aspirations and power-hungry regulators for the widening probe into
finances at the troubled thrift.
   ``Things like this happened in the early 1930s in Germany,''
said David Paul, who is challenging a state order seeking his
ouster.
   Last week, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision halted trading of CenTrust stock, which had fallen to
75 cents, claiming the thrift misrepresented its financial picture
in its latest filings. The ban, the first against a bank since
1983, is due to be lifted Tuesday.
   The thrift office believes CenTrust would be insolvent if it
accurately reported its holdings, including more then $900 million
in high-risk junk bonds.
   CenTrust, which reported a $119 million loss for the fiscal year
ended Sept. 30, also is being investigated as part of a junk bond
trading probe by the House Banking Subcommittee.
   Subcommittee members may subpeona Paul to testify about his
links to former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond wizard
Michael Milken and Charles Keating, the key figure in the $2.5
billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif., The
Miami Herald reported Sunday.
   The Herald also cited unnamed sources saying federal and state
banking regulators met last week with representatives of U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen in Miami. Spokesmen for the thrift office
and the U.S. attorney refused comment.
   ``I don't think CenTrust will be here two years from now, and I
don't think David Paul will be involved in the management of a
regulated institution,'' said state Deputy Comptroller Larry Fuchs.
   Paul acknowledged that CenTrust is under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue
Service, but he said he does not believe the probe involves his
personal finances.
   Paul, 50, who took over the institution in 1983, collected more
than $4.8 million in salary and benefits from January 1988 to
September 1989 and has been criticized by state officials for
lavish spending practices.
   But Paul claims CenTrust is the target of a crusade by federal
regulators and state Comptroller Gerald Lewis, who is running for
re-election this year.
   ``What you have here is inter-government agencies investigating,
initiated by the comptroller's office,'' said Paul, whose initials
DLP is the CenTrust stock symbol. ``The government is very
powerful, has a lot of money and, in general, is scary.''
   Among the aspects being scrutinized by regulators are CenTrust's
$30 million investment in paintings, a company yacht and lavish
expenses and salaries.
   State officials say they have a sworn statement that CenTrust
funds paid for Paul's residential telephone bills, garbage
collection and about $150,000 in other household items.
   Paul said the paintings were the ``biggest mistake'' of his
life, but he denied many of the other charges about corporate
expenses.
   ``I think you've got a government out of control,'' said Paul.
``These people are just doing anything they want at any time, and
the press jumps on the bandwagon and takes their unverified
allegations as truth.''

<HEAD>Independent Truckers Plan Informational Strike at Port of Houston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent truckers connected to 42 hauling
companies plan to picket the Port of Houston and railway terminals
to protest low rates and rising diesel costs.
   ``Diesel fuel has gone up for me 25 cents a gallon in a month,''
said Wade Richardson, a Houston trucker. ``I can't turn around to
these shippers and say I need 25 cents more per gallon. They'd
laugh in my face.''
   About 150 truckers with leases to the companies gathered
Saturday to organize the picketing, which they hope will shut the
port today. Richardson said 500 truckers are expected to park at
the port and join the action.
   Trucks also will be parked and pickets set up at 16 other points
in Houston and Galveston, including the Santa Fe Railway and
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. terminals, he said Sunday.
   ``We expect to shut the Port of Houston down and the
railroads,'' said Attice Warren, a Houston trucker and organizer of
the strike.
   The terminals and port were chosen, Richardson and Warren said,
because most of the truckers involved haul containers from trains
and ships.
   He said truckers and their companies are at the mercy of cheap
hauling rates paid by steamship agencies.
   Diesel costs $1.21 a gallon in Houston, the American Automobile
Association said. It was as high as $2.44 a gallon in Maine
recently.
   The truckers also said maintenance, insurance and regulatory
costs have diminished their earnings.
   ``We've just gotten to the point where there's nothing left to
take,'' Warren said.
   ``The highways are arteries of the nation. The truckers are the
blood. We deliver the nutrients and take away the waste. We should
make a livable wage,'' he said.
   Rita Bontz, president of Independent Truckers and Drivers
Association in Baltimore, Md., said her organization, which has
members in 30 states, did not plan to take part in any picketing.
   ``There are problems but there are other ways to address them,''
she said.
   ``We're telling truckers that a shutdown is not the best way to
deal with this,'' said Todd Spencer, spokesman for the
10,600-member Owner-Operator Independent Driver's Association in
Oak Grove, Mo.
   Spencer said rumors of a wildcat strike have been circulating
nationwide _ especially from the Carolinas and Texas _ for about
three weeks.
   ``What we're trying to do is monitor and defuse the situation,''
he said.
   Richardson is on the board of Houston Container Haulers, a group
of several hundred drivers, but said the group is not calling for
the strike.
   The group gathered attention in October with a convoy of 450
trucks that drove the interstate loop around Houston in a protest
of low hauling rates.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
moderately today, and the dollar fell against the Japanese yen for
the fifth consecutive trading day.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 299.63 points, or 0.81
percent, closing at 37,173.70. It had lost 95.04 points Friday.
   Dealers attributed the moderate recovery to the yen's strength
against the dollar. Buy orders also increased because today was the
first day for February contracts, they said. In stock trading, each
month's contracts start four days before the calendar month.
   ``Market players welcomed the yen's recovery, but trading was
extremely thin for the first day of the new month,'' said Kozo
Hasunuma, a dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``Many market players, especially institutional investors,
remained on the sidelines due to uncertainties over U.S. interest
rates, especially ahead of the U.S. jobless rate report later this
week,'' he said.
   Only 400 million shares changed hands on the first section.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.22 yen, down 0.75
yen from Friday's close of 143.97 yen. It opened at 143.07 yen and
ranged between 142.85 yen and 143.23 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 3.20 yen in five trading days.
   Traders said that in today's trading, the dollar was buffeted by
worse-than-expected figures for the U.S. gross national product.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the nation's
GNP grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent in
last year's fourth quarter.
   But the dollar rebounded from its early losses today as
speculative investors bought it back in the afternoon.
   An estimated $6.66 billion changed hands in spot trading.

   Here are the projected outlays of the federal
government, broken down by major function of the government,
according to the spending plan sent to Congress by President Bush
on Monday.
   The years shown are the government's fiscal years, running from
October of one calendar year through September of the next. For
example, the 1991 fiscal year begins Oct. 1, 1990, and runs through
Sept. 30, 1991.
   ``Offsetting receipts'' are funds received for several
activities but not applied to functional categories that must be
counted to get totals. These are shown as negative numbers. An
example is the money the government earns as royalties for oil
wells in federal waters offshore.
   ``Receipts'' are the overall amounts the government receives
from all sources _ taxes, fees, royalties, duties and so forth.
   The numbers shown are in billions of dollars.
   Columns may not add to totals shown because of rounding.
   The deficit results from the government spending more money than
it takes in, and is made up by borrowing.
   The minus sign before the projected deficit for 1993 denotes a
projected surplus.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is sending his first budget to
Congress today, a $1.23 trillion spending plan that seeks to
achieve former President Reagan's elusive goal of controlling the
federal deficit.
   Bush's spending blueprint for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1
proposes slashing the deficit in half without violating his
no-new-taxes campaign promise.
   Instead Bush is offering to cut the capital gains tax, which
critics charge would benefit the wealthy, and to create a new
Family Savings Account aimed at middle-class taxpayers who could
squirrel away up to $5,000 a year and earn tax-free interest.
   Bush is counting on a healthy economy to help boost government
revenue in 1991 by 9 percent, while he would hold the overall
increase in spending to 3 percent. He also would gain $13.9 billion
in a variety of minor new taxes and user fees charged to provide
government services.
   Savings would come in the Pentagon budget, where the
administration is proposing a sweeping reordering of the nation's
defense priorities to reflect the lessening of East-West tensions.
   The government's huge Medicare health program also would be
targeted for reductions, along with smaller cuts in such programs
as farm subsidies, low-income energy assistance and college student
loans.
   Bush would reallocate the money saved to boost spending on such
programs as environmental protection, education, space and the war
on drugs.
   Bush's budget calls for spending $1.233 trillion in 1991 while
projecting revenues of $1.170 trillion. That would leave a budget
deficit of $63.1 billion, which, if realized, would be the smallest
amount of red ink since 1979. Bush estimated the current year's
deficit at $123.8 billion.
   The projected 1991 deficit would be just below the $64 billion
target established by the Gramm-Rudman law, which mandates a
balanced budget by 1993. Bush said he would hit that target,
proposing a surplus of $5.7 billion that year.
   The specific details on the budget were revealed in interviews
and in documents obtained by The Associated Press.
   Even before the budget was released, critics were accusing the
administration of adopting an overly rosy economic scenario which
inflates the amount of taxes the government is likely to take in.
   While not calling Bush's budget ``dead on arrival,'' the epithet
hurled at most of Reagan's spending plans, Democrats in Congress
left no doubt that they intended to challenge Bush on many of the
proposals.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said the
Bush plan would get a ``very chilly and negative reaction on the
Hill.''
   The most bruising fights were likely to revolve around Bush's
renewed push for a cut in the capital gains tax and over a rival
Democratic proposal advanced by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
provide a $62 billion cut in Social Security taxes this year and
next.
   Moynihan claims that the surpluses accumulating in the Social
Security trust fund are being used to mask the real budget deficit
rather than being saved for the baby boomers' retirement.
   Bush's budget proposed an alternative plan to begin using a
portion of the Social Security surpluses to reduce the national
debt.
   Democrats also were upset with Bush's military budget, which
proposed spending $303.3 billion, which amounted to a 2 percent cut
when compared to the costs of inflation.
   Critics were unhappy because Bush's budget proposed to reduce
troops and civilian Defense Department employees by 38,000 while
protecting such pet projects as the Strategic Defense Initiative
nuclear shield.
   To meet the pared-down spending levels, the Defense Department
was proposing a sweeping list of military base closings, also a
bone of contention with Congress.
   Outside of the Pentagon, the biggest proposed reduction came in
an $8.5 billion cut in the projected growth of the Medicare program
for the elderly and handicapped. The money would be saved by
cutting payments to hospitals and doctors, but Congress balked at a
similar proposal last year.
   Bush proposed other cuts for farm programs and in payments to
retired federal workers.
   The budget also includes:
   _$500 million more for Head Start, the preschool program for
poor children, putting total spending at $1.9 billion.
   _An increase of $1.1 billion for the war on drugs, boosting
total spending to $10.6 billion.
   _A hefty increase in spending for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration with gains also coming to fund development of
the giant atom-smasher known as the supercollider.
   _New spending of more than $2 billion to fund an ``America the
Beautiful'' program that would accelerate the cleanup of hazardous
waste dumps and launch a massive tree planting program to combat
the effects of global warming.
   The administration's proposed Family Savings Accounts would
allow individuals to invest up to $2,500 a year and families to
invest up to $5,000 annually in tax-free savings accounts as long
as the money was not withdrawn for at least seven years.
   The administration, seeking to counter a plan advanced by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, also proposed easing current restrictions
on Individual Retirement Accounts, to allow savings to be withdrawn
without penalty before retirement if the money was used for a
first-time purchase of a home.
   Bush's budget document represented his first full budget
outline. Last February, he submitted a 193-page list of amendments
to Reagan's final budget.

<HEAD>Colgate Buying Two Canadian Businesses From Bristol-Myers Squibb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co. on Monday announced an
agreement to acquire Canada's bleach and fabric softener businesses
from Bristol Myers Squibb Co. for $172 million.
   The purchase is part of Colgate's strategy to be a major force
in the profitable bleach category, said Reuben Mark, the consumer
products company's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Before buying the two businesses, which will be known as The
Javex Manufacturing Co. Inc. and The Javix Marketing Co. Inc.,
Colgate was the largest marketer of household bleach outside North
America, Mark said.
   Colgate built a strong presence in bleach overseas mainly
through its acquisition of the Cotelle and Klorin bleach businesses
in Europe and by introducing its own brands in selected world
markets.
   The addition of the Javex companies will almost double Colgate's
revenue base in Canada. The companies have annual sales of about
100 million Canadian dollars and operate six plants across the
country.
   Javex bleach brands lead the market in Canada in both the
chlorine and non-chlorine categories. The Fleecy brand is the
country's No.1 liquid fabric softener.
   The acquisition of the Javex bleaches and fabric softeners,
which will join such well-known Colgate-Palmolive brands as Colgate
toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, Ajax cleanser and Fab detergent, is
subject to approval by Canadian government authorities and certain
other conditions.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as reports of
rain in South America offset forecasts for drier weather in the
U.S. winter wheat belt.
   Croplands in Argentina, a large producer of soybeans and corn,
received up to an inch of rain over the weekend and widespread
showers were expected there again today.
   ``They needed rain in Argentina and they got it. That's the main
thing weighing on the markets this morning,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Forecasts for drier weather this week in the U.S. winter wheat
belt prompted some buying of wheat futures.
   But the gains were limited by news that Egypt bought 300,000
metric tons of European wheat over the weekend, a disappointment
for U.S. wheat producers and grain handlers.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.81} a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1} cents lower with March at $2.37} a bushel; oats
were unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.37{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March at
$5.57} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Most pork-belly contracts were down the
2-cents-a-pound daily limit in early trading amid a continuing
slide in fresh belly prices and slack demand by bacon producers.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February
at 79.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .10
cent higher with March at 83.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .12
cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 49.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.97 cents to 2 cents lower with February
at 52.10 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday while pork futures were
lower.

   Chrysler Corp. is extending many
guaranteed incentive programs through February and adding a $50
offer to consumers who buy vehicles they test drive _ even if it's
not a Chrysler.
   The No. 3 automaker is letting incentives on its
industry-leading minivans expire.
   The test-drive offer aims at getting consumers to shop around,
trying Chrysler vehicles against other makers' cars. Chrysler said
it would pay consumers $50 if they buy a vehicle they tested, even
if it isn't a Chrysler.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca revealed the rebate extensions Sunday in
commercials broadcast during the Super Bowl on CBS and the Senior
Skins golf tournament on NBC.
   In December, Chrysler announced the programs and guaranteed the
incentives on eligible 1990 models purchased or leased would stay
the same until Sept. 30.
   Although some incentive programs slated to end Wednesday have
been extended, the first-time rebate offers on Chrysler minivans,
including the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Town &amp; Country,
will end. Chrysler controls more than 50 percent of the minivan
market.
   The 1990 models and rebates added to the Jan. 28-through-Feb. 28
guaranteed program include: $2,000 on Dodge Ramcharger; $1,500 on
Dodge Monaco ES and some full-size Ram Van conversions; $1,000 on
Plymouth Horizon, Dodge Omni, Chrysler LeBaron sedan, Dodge Monaco
LE, Dakota S, two- and four-wheel diesel pickups, full-size Ram Van
and Ram Wagon, Comanche and Grand Wagoneer; and $500 on Wrangler.

<HEAD>Rig Count Down 27 to 937, Still Above Same Period Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
continued to decline, dropping by 27 this week to 937, Baker Hughes
Inc. reported.
   Despite the decrease, the rig count was higher than the 797
total posted for the same week last year, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   In the previous week, the count tumbled, dropping by 55 to 964.
Experts blamed the decline on bad weather in some states and a
general seasonal decline.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Ike Kerridge, a Baker Hughes vice president and economist, said
the rig count generally declines during the first quarter. The
count, he said, probably will bottom out in March or April.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana lost 17 rigs and
Oklahoma was down 12. Wyoming lost six, Michigan was down by four
and Pennsylvania lost two.
   New Mexico, Kansas and Texas each gained four rigs, while North
Dakota's count increased by two.

   The Food and Drug Administration today banned
some uses of the color additive Red No. 3, saying studies have
shown that in very high doses it causes cancer in laboratory
animals.
   ``Today's action prevents further use of this color additive in
about one-fifth of its uses _ in cosmetics such as lipsticks, in
externally applied drugs and as a pigment form called `lakes' in
food, drugs and cosmetics,'' the FDA said in a news release.
   It said that because studies showed the risk from using Red No.
3 is considered small, consumers may continue using existing
supplies of products that contain the color additive.
   The FDA also said it is in the process of extending the ban to
cover those uses for which Red No. 3 still is approved.
   Some products use both the straight form of the dye as well as a
pigment form, called a lake. It is the lakes, or tints, that are
being banned, so products that use both will have to stop using the
lake form but can continue using the straight dye.
   Products for which use is banned include shampoos, lipsticks,
powders, skin-care products, baking mixes, wax coatings for cheese,
chewing gum, confections and frostings, gelatins, puddings,
fillings, hard candy, herbs, spices, seasonings, processed fruits
and juices, drug tablet formulations and liquid drug preparations.
   Catherine J. Bailey, consumer safety officer at FDA, said
products for which some use is still approved include soft candy,
breakfast cereals, hard candy, juices, meat products, chewing gum,
maraschino cherries, icings, cake decorations, cakes, plant protein
products, canned puddings and sweet rolls.
   All uses of Red No. 3 in cosmetics is being banned.
   Other red dyes are approved for use in foods, drugs and
cosmetics, the FDA said.
   The FDA has been studying Red No. 3 for 30 years. Under pressure
from industry groups and members of Congress, the agency has been
reluctant to impose a ban.
   ``The actual risk posed by Red No. 3 is extremely small.
However, federal law in this area is clear,'' said Dr. Louis
Sullivan, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department.
   ``There have been laboratory studies which showed that very high
doses of Red No. 3, administered directly in the diet, caused
cancer in rats,'' he said. ``In these circumstances, small as the
risk is, we have no choice under the law but to end the provisional
listing of this product,'' he said.
   Sullivan said the FDA's action illustrates the rigidity of the
law and said Congress should consider updating the statutes ``to
reflect advances in the methods of scientific assessment that were
not available when the law was originally passed in 1960.''
   The risk of getting cancer from Red No. 3 is no larger than 1 in
100,000 over a lifetime of consumption, the FDA said. In
comparison, the risk from natural disasters is about 70 in 100,000
and from disasters such as railroad accidents and air crashes, the
risk is about 6 in 100,000, the agency said.
   The red dye has been on a ``provisional list'' since 1960, when
Congress called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory
animals. At the time, about 200 color additives were put on the
provisional list, allowing them to stay on the market for an
additional two years pending further study.
   Over the years, the FDA has granted dozens of extensions to
allow Red No. 3 to remain on the provisional list.
   The FDA's action terminating ``provisional uses'' of the dye
removes the last of the full color additives from the provisional
list, although tints of certain permanently listed colors remain on
the list.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today sent Congress a $1.23
trillion budget for next year that slows the growth in military
spending in response to ``dramatic changes in the world'' and calls
for no general tax increase as part of a plan to cut the federal
deficit by half.
   Bush proposed hefty spending increases for the 1991 fiscal year
in space exploration, cleaning up the environment and the Head
Start pre-school program. He also recommended cuts in Medicare,
college student loans and farm subsidies, among other domestic
programs.
   Bush's budget _ the first one he has written from scratch _ was
certain to provoke sharp debate in the Democratic-controlled
Congress.
   ``With an eye toward future growth, and expansion of the human
frontier, the budget's chief emphasis is on investment in the
future,'' Bush said in a written message that introduced the
1,569-page budget.
   ``At the same time, the budget maintains a strong national
defense while reflecting the dramatic changes in the world
political situation that are taking place, and it fulfills
responsibilities to protect the environment and preserve America's
cultural heritage,'' Bush said.
   His plan calls for $303.3 billion for defense, a cut of 2
percent after inflation is taken into account, and a reflection of
the reduction in tension produced by political change in Eastern
Europe.
   Bush's plan renews the president's call for a tax cut for
capital gains, which critics say would benefit the wealthy, and
introduces a new Family Savings Account aimed at middle-class
taxpayers who could squirrel away up to $5,000 a year and earn
interest tax free.
   The president's outline proposed cutting the federal deficit to
$63.1 billion in the 1991 budget year, and if the target is met, it
would be the lowest federal deficit in more than a decade. The
president estimated this year's red ink at $123.8 billion, far
above the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction target of $100 billion.
   ``This is a listen-to-what-I-say and forget-what-I-do budget. It
predicts huge fiscal problems ahead and then goes on to propose no
change in course,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee. ``This document may put a very low
ceiling on what we can expect to accomplish with the deficit this
year.''
   The administration's plan promises to balance the budget by
1993, as called for in the Gramm-Rudman law. But to do that it
relies heavily on forecasts for economic growth and interest rates
that many economists believe are overly optimistic.
   Bush forecasts that the overall economy will grow by 2.6 percent
this year when measured from the fourth quarter of 1989, an
assumption that most private analysts believe is too optimistic by
nearly 1 percentage point.
   The budget document concedes that for every 1 percentage point
shortfall in growth, the budget deficit will be increased by $18
billion.
   While not calling Bush's budget ``dead on arrival,'' the epithet
hurled at most of the Reagan administration's spending plans,
Democrats in Congress left no doubt that they planned to challenge
many domestic cuts while seeking to get even more savings out of
the Defense Department.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said Congress would demand
a bigger cut in defense and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., challenged the proposed Medicare cuts as ``too deep. We've
been cutting each and every year'' in this program.
   Proposed cuts in programs such as farm subsidies, federal
retirees' benefits and benefits to help the poor pay their heating
bills have been recommended before _ and created sharp debate in
Congress.
   Bush's defense budget proposed trimming military personnel by
38,000, accompanied by an effort to close military bases
nationwide. At the same time it protected expensive weapons
programs such as the Star Wars nuclear shield, which would receive
a $1 billion spending increase.
   The capital gains tax proposal was expected to generate another
bruising congressional fight, just as it did last year, with the
new twist of a rival proposal from Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
provide a $62 billion cut in Social Security taxes this year and
next.
   Moynihan charges that the Social Security surpluses are not
being saved for the Baby Boomers' retirement as intended, but
instead are being used to mask the true size of the deficit.
   To counteract that argument, the administration put in the
budget a proposal to use a portion of the surpluses beginning in
1993 to reduce the national debt.
   The various cuts in domestic programs totalled $13.9 billion in
savings, with $5.5 billion of that coming from trims in doctor and
hospitals payments in the giant Medicare health care program.
   Other major program cuts included $1.8 billion in farm price
supports and crop insurance and savings of $2.9 billion by limiting
pension increases to federal civilian retirees and by restraining
cost of living increases to civilian and military government
workers. Aid to urban mass transit systems would be cut sharply and
low-income energy assistance would be trimmed by $340 million, to
less than $1.1 billion.
   Bush recommended eliminating the federal subsidy to Amtrak,
which amounted to slightly more than $600 million for the current
fiscal year.
   The money saved from the cuts would be channeled to programs
slated for increases.
   One of the biggest gains would come in spending commitments for
space exploration, scheduled to jump 24 percent, with extra money
over the next several years for an orbiting space station and for a
down payment on manned trips to the Moon and Mars.
   Other budget details:
   _ A hefty increase in the war on drugs, boosting total spending
in 1991 to $9.7 billion. Commitments for future years would push
the total to $10.6 billion.
   _ $500 million more for Head Start, the preschool program for
poor childen, putting total spending at $1.9 billion.
   _ New spending of more than $2 billion to fund an ``America the
Beautiful'' program that would accelerate the cleanup of hazardous
waste dumps and launch a massive tree planting program to combat
the effects of global warming.
   _ A 16 percent increase in spending for aviation programs to
expand airport capacity and upgrad the air controller system.
   _ A $3 billion increase in foreign aid to $14.2 billion with
much of the money targeted for assistance to Eastern Europe and
anti-drug efforts in Central and South America.
   Bush devoted one section of the budget to ideas for ``advancing
states as laboratories,'' promising to reduce federal controls so
state governors and legislators have greater latitude to try new
methods of attacking problems.
   Bush called for no general tax increase, in keeping with his
1988 campaign pledge. But he recommended $5.6 billion in ``user
fees'' such as charges to drug companies to cover the cost of
federal drug testing.
   The administration's proposed Family Savings Accounts would
allow individuals to invest up to $2,500 a year and families to
invest up to $5,000 annually in tax-free savings accounts as long
as the money was not withdrawn for at least seven years.
   The administration, seeking to counter a plan advanced by Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, also proposed easing current restrictions
on Individual Retirement Accounts, to allow up to $10,000 savings
to be withdrawn without penalty if the money was used for a
first-time purchase of a home.
   The president's budget message was boiled down to one page this
year. It was supplemented by a 15-page overview written by Budget
Director Richard Darman. Drafted in whimsical language, it
described the federal budget as the ``ultimate cookie monster''
that mindlessly gobbles up scarce resources.

   Prices closed higher but below their session peaks
on London's Stock Exchange Monday, held back by a humdrum
performance on Wall Street.
   Sentiment was slightly more positive after Friday's
better-than-expected British trade figures, traders said.
   But investors seemed wary of getting involved in equities before
the corporate earnings season gets into full swing in mid-February,
they said.
   ``Only the quality stocks are being nibbled at,'' one trader
said. ``This implies that people are still cautious but still want
to be in the market.''
   By late in the London day, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up just 3.61 points at 2,562.84.
   ``We haven't seen any institutional selling, so if markets were
to stabilize worldwide, it would have a calming influence'' on
shares, said one London brokerage firm's director. ``We might be in
for a period where it's better to trade sideways for the time
being.''
   At the end of London trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 14.3 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,328.8,
sharply higher than its opening low point of 2,317.8 but below its
peak of 2,333.3.
   Volume came to a modest 419.4 million shares, compared with
560.3 million shares Friday.

<HEAD>Procrastination on a Massive Scale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the economy's problems are several that
should have been dealt with long ago but weren't. Procrastination
has made them grow.
   Oil is among the problems, as it was back in the 1970s. The cost
of medical care is another. And a whole basket of financial issues
_ the low savings rate, the budget and trade deficits, and debt at
every level _ make up more.
   Though it has been a growing problem for decades, nobody seems
to have the answer to rising medical costs.
   Insurers have cracked down on wasteful practices and hospitals
are more efficiently run than before, but health is a unique
business. Advances in technology tend to lower costs in most
industries. Not in medicine.
   Cars and other manufactured products have built-in obsolescence;
it does not pay to perfect them. When human lives are involved
there is no such restraint. The attempt must be made.
   Nobody has the answer, and year by year the cost of medical care
rises faster than the rate of general inflation. You do not even
have to review the statistics to know that this was so last year _
and the year before and before that, too.
   Emphasizing the problem, a large employee benefits consultant,
A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co., today released a survey of 1,943
employers. It found that the cost of employer medical plans soared
20.4 percent in 1989.
   That increase brought the average cost of medical plans to
$2,600 last year from $2,160 in 1988. Add in the cost of dental
plans and health maintenance organizations, it says, and the
average rose to $2,748 from $2,354.
   Answers to the problem have most often been sought in more
efficient delivery of medical care. But that having failed to
contain costs the newer efforts may be made in curtailment of care.
   In other words, the problem may be as much ethical as medical or
economic.
   The oil problem was supposed to have been settled a decade ago,
or at least it seemed that way from the promises: The United States
would raise domestic production simultaneously with mainly
self-imposed restraints by users.
   It seemed to work. Solar power was developed, domestic
production rose, homeowners insulated their houses, the automotive
industry learned to get more miles per gallon and utilities learned
to burn fuel more efficiently.
   The various efforts produced results, with the rate of
consumption falling behind the rate of economic expansion.
Conservation was working, and operators of the oil cartel were
forced to lower prices.
   Never again, Americans seemed to say, and they backed their
words with statistical proof. But as inflation fell and the economy
rose _ and as a sense of security returned _ many of the promises
were forgotten.
   Now, says economist Edward Yardeni, ``the new decade begins with
Americans as dependent on foreign oil as we were just before the
oil crisis of 1979.'' Yardeni, an optimist who sees a lot more
strength in the U.S. economy than many of his colleagues,
nevertheless is worried that America is vulnerable to another oil
shock. He calls it is a serious threat to his optimism.
   The numbers underscore his fears. Last year, the decline in
domestic oil production was the biggest for any year ever _ more
than half a million barrels a day to just 7.6 million barrels a
day, lowest in 26 years.
   Meanwhile, imports of crude oil and petroleum products have been
soaring. In 1985, those imports ran about 5.1 million barrels a
day. Last year, the comparable figure was 8 million barrels.
   Unlike the health care situation, where a true dilemma exists,
the answers to the oil challenge are known. The only thing lacking
is the sense of urgency that would implement them, and that could
come this year.

   The stock market closed lower in volatile
trading today driven partly by interest-rate worries and concerns
about financing of leveraged buyouts.
   The market opened higher, then fluctuated wildly throughout the
session.
   Wall Street analysts said disarray in the junk bond market
pressured takeover-related stocks and helped drive the market
lower, particularly transportation issues.
   Although some traders said the market was in for a technical
rebound after the recent sell-off, there was little to provide
momentum. The market has lost about 8 percent since the start of
the year. After hitting a record high of 2,810.15 on Jan. 1, the
Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 250 points as of last
Friday when it closed at 2,559.23.
   Analysts said investors remained concerned about the level of
interest rates and their attractiveness to foreign investors.
   ``The problem is concern about foreign investors not
participating in our markets,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``At what interest rate would
it take to get them to participate?''
   They said players were reluctant to make commitments ahead of
next week's Treasury refunding, which could determine the level at
which foreign investors are willing to buy U.S. bonds.
   ``The market is oversold right now. It's looking for a technical
rebound but with interest rates expected to remain unstable it's
difficult to sustain anything on the upside,'' said Richard
Ciardullo, head trader for Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   Higher interest rates would be a negative for the stock market
because it would make government securities more competitive,
analysts said.

<HEAD>UAW Holds Out Hope for Chrysler Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber
held out hope Monday that Friday's scheduled closing of Chrysler's
Corp.'s Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit could be put off.
   Bieber said the plant's closing, which will put about 1,700
people out of work, will be among the issues he talks about Tuesday
with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and other company executives.
   ``I'm always going to take advantage of one last day to make one
more pitch to see if there's anything that can be done,'' Bieber
said.
   His chances of success are practically non-existent. The UAW
earlier proposed that Chrysler continue limited production of the
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts at the plant and sell
them to targeted groups of consumers. Chrysler rejected that plan.
   Chrysler and General Motors Corp. have announced plant closings
or production reductions that will result in the indefinite layoffs
of more than 13,000 auto workers by the end of March. Ford Motor
Co. has been able to avoid indefinite layoffs by trimming overtime
and rotating temporary layoffs.
   Chrysler announced in November that its Jefferson Avenue
assembly plant, which has been making cars since 1907 and Chrysler
products since 1924, will be shut down Feb. 2, about two years
earlier than planned.
   The plant will be replaced in 1992 by the Jefferson North plant,
now under construction next to the existing factory on Detroit's
east side. The new plant will make sport-utility vehicles beginning
for the 1993 model year.
   Chrysler invoked language in its contract with the UAW allowing
it to close a plant when sales slip, as has happened with the Omni
and Horizon cars. But the UAW is contesting the closing, saying
Chrysler did too little to keep the cars, introduced in the 1978
model year, alive.
   Bieber said he and Iacocca have other topics to discuss.
   ``We want to talk to them about the whole question of employment
and job security, what's going to happen to the workers not only at
Jefferson but at the others and the industry as a whole,'' Bieber
said at a news conference before speaking to the Economic Club of
Detroit.
   Bieber tried to sidestep a question about bargaining priorities
when the union opens talks with each of the Big Three automakers in
July. The UAW contracts with the automakers expire at midnight,
Sept. 14.
   The leader of the 1-million-member union said bargaining
priorities will be set at a special UAW bargaining convention
beginning May 21 in Kansas City, Mo.
   However, he said, ``Obviously, job security has got to be an
issue that I feel very comfortable the delegates are going to say
is of primary importance. ... So job security has got to be No. 1.''
   Bieber also reiterated the union's support for a national
health-care program. For years, automakers have complained about
soaring worker health-care costs, and some automakers have
estimated that health insurance programs add hundreds of dollars to
the price of every new car.

   Energy futures prices rose Monday with wholesale
home heating oil posting particularly strong gains.
   The contract for February delivery of No. 2 heating oil closed
1.51 cents higher at 61.11 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, rebounding from Friday's decline of 0.17 cent.
The March and April contracts ended with similar increases.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
February wholesale unleaded regular gasoline finished up 0.70 cent
at 62.82 cents a gallon, adding to Friday's gain of 1.52 cents.
Contracts for later delivery also advanced, but more moderately.
   Crude oil extended its rally into a third straight session after
reaching a low of $21.60 a barrel during Thursday's trading. The
March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of
U.S. crude oil, closed at $22.80 per 42-gallon barrel, up 24 cents.
The contract had gone up 32 cents on Friday.
   Contracts for delivery of West Texas Intermediate during April
through June rose by 30 cents to 34 cents a barrel.
   The strength in the crude oil trading pits partly reflected
speculation about future refiner demand, said Andrew Lebow, a
broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Some of the buying was due to internal market dynamics, such as
short covering, he said, noting that it was difficult to pinpoint
specific reasons why energy prices were bid higher. Short covering
involves buying back a previously sold commodity.

<HEAD>Telemundo Says Silverman Resigns as CEO to Join Blackstone Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telemundo Group Inc., a Spanish-language
television station operator and programmer, said Monday that its
president and chief executive, Henry R. Silverman, plans to resign.
   Silverman plans to leave the company Feb. 2 to join the private
investment banking firm The Blackstone Group as a general partner,
the announcement said.
   He will be replaced as chief executive at Telemundo by chairman
Saul Steinberg. Donald G. Raider will continue to handle day-to-day
management of Telemundo as executive vice president and chief
operating officer.
   Silverman will remain on the Telemundo board and advise the
company on strategic issues, the statement said.
   Silverman's exertise has been in the mergers and acquisitions
arena, and has been associated with Steinberg in two major
restructurings.
   As an officer of Reliance Capital Group, a subsidiary of
Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc., Silverman negotiated the
$600 million acquisition of the Days Inn of America motel chain in
1984. He headed Days Inn until it was sold last year for $765
million.
   He also orchestated the formation of Telemundo as a
Spanish-language television power. Telemundo was founded in
November 1985 and bought a television station in Los Angeles that
was converted into a Spanish-language operation.
   In 1986, Telemundo acquired John Blair &amp; Co., a communications
concern for $600 million. Telemundo sold all of Blair's assets
except for two Spanish-language TV stations for $500 million and
bought additional stations in New York, San Jose, Calif., and
Houston.
   Telemundo also acquired a company in Miami that distributed
programming via satellite and it has converted that operation into
a Spanish-language TV network through which it supplies programming
to 31 affiliate stations that reach 77 percent of all Hispanic
households in the United States.
   ``Henry has played a key role in the rapid growth of Telemundo,
helping to transform our vision for the companmy into a reality,''
Steinberg said in a news release.
   Silverman said he decided to move on because his skills are in
finance and acquisitions and Telemundo ``no longer needs my
abilities'' while Blackstone Group will put them to work.
   He said as a principal at Blackstone Group, he will concentrate
on managing funds that firm has assembled for investment in
companies recently bought out that have encountered financial
difficulties or need to be restructured.
   Blackstone's co-founders, Chairman Peter G. Peterson and
President Stephen A. Schwarzman, said Silverman's addtion to the
firm ``adds another dimension to our financial services.''
   Blackstone Group provides a wide spectrum of financial advisory
services to major industrial corporations and financial
institutions.

<HEAD>Key Reversal Seen Halting Soybean Market's Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rebounded sharply Monday from
life-of-contract lows in a move that could mark a turnaround in the
market after a six-week slide.
   Most grain futures also advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade.
On other commodity markets, oil futures rose strongly; pork bellies
posted limit losses while livestock futures were mixed; and
precious metals declined.
   Soybean futures settled 5 cents to 8\ cents higher in Chicago
with the contract for delivery in March up 5 cents at $5.63{ a
bushel.
   Wheat futures ended 2{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March
at $3.78} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1{ cents higher with March
at $2.39{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent higher across the board with
March at $1.38\ a bushel.
   During the session, March soybeans traded as low as $5.53{ a
bushel, eclipsing the contract's previous low of $5.57{, but
finished above the previous session's high of $5.61.
   Technical analysts call such a performance a ``key reversal.''
It often signals the end of a long-term trend.
   ``If you're going to look for places to buy the market, I think
this is it, at least for a little while,'' said Pat O'Connell,
grains analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat and corn futures also closed above their lows for the day
but analysts said those reversals were less significant than the
soybean market's performance.
   Soybeans had opened mixed, with selling pressure stemming from
reports of beneficial rain over the weekend in the soybean fields
of Argentina. The market made its lows before noon CST, then headed
higher along with the wheat market, which was rallying strongly on
its own technical signals.
   Wheat's rally stalled, but the soybeans kept climbing into the
close.
   When the key reversal was established, ``the market just fed on
itself,'' said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``That's what gave us that extra 2 cents or so, that little push
up to the final high for the day,'' she said.
   Wheat and soybean futures prices have been slipping since
mid-December due to a lack of export demand and improved growing
conditions for winter wheat and the South American soybean crop.
   Soybean and corn traders will soon begin to focus on crop
weather in the Corn Belt, where planting begins in about three
months. A 90-day forecast issued Monday by the National Weather
Service predicted drier-than-normal weather for western Corn Belt
states through the end of April, which could be a supportive signal
for prices.
   Petroluem futures rose strongly, paced by the February gasoline
and heating-oil contracts, which cease trading on Wednesday.
Volatile price swings often precede contract expirations as traders
scurry to escape or secure delivery commitments.
   Crude oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
technically inspired buying in the absence of significant
supply-and-demand developments.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 26 cents to 34 cents
higher with March at $22.80 a barrel; heating oil was .67 cent to
1.51 cents higher with February at 61.11 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .36 cent to .85 cent higher with February at 62.82
cents a gallon.
   Most frozen pork-belly futures fell the permitted daily limit of
2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, marking the
second straight day of limit losses.
   Analysts said the collapse reflected a combination of technical
sell signals, weak cash markets, slack demand for fresh bellies by
bacon slicers and high slaughter rates last week.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 79.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .17
cent lower with March at 83.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .17
cent lower to .12 cent higher with February at 49.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.52 cents to 2 cents lower with February
at 52.10 cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1 lower
across the board with January at $419.10 a troy ounce; silver was
0.7 cent to 0.8 cent lower with March at $5.253 a troy ounce.

   Joe Montana seemed like just the tonic Wall
Street needed to cure its January ills.
   But not even a lopsided victory by the San Francisco 49ers in
Sunday's Super Bowl could inspire stock traders Monday, who sent
the Dow Jones industrial average down another 5.85 points to
2,553.38.
   The average of 30 blue-chip stocks is off more than 250 points
since hitting a record high of 2,810.15 on Jan. 2.
   According to market lore, a Super Bowl victory by a team from
the original National Football League, before its merger with the
American Football League, has usually been followed by an up year
for stock prices.
   Now, granted, there's still time for the market to rally over
the course of 1990, but if Monday's performance is any indication,
stock traders aren't in the mood for fun and games.
   ``There might have been 40 or 50 people buying on the Super Bowl
outcome, but the big money, I can assure you, wasn't,'' said Yale
Hirsch, a stock adviser in Old Tappan, N.J., and publisher of the
Stock Trader's Almanac.
   In his annual almanac, Hirsch says the direction stock prices
take in January has foreshadowed the full year's outcome correctly
all but three times since 1950. This January, he said, will be no
exception as he forecasts a bearish economy in 1990, Super Bowl
victory or not.
   ``It's a marvelous phenomenon that's very entertaining, but I'll
be damned if the outcome of a football game can predict the outlook
for the economy,'' Hirsch said.
   Yet, a glimmer of hope ran through a few people's minds after
the opening bell Monday when prices staged a brief, if uninspired
rally.
   ``People were even saying that the early rally might be
attributed to the Super Bowl win by the 49ers,'' said Brad Weeks,
head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, who
dismissed such a notion.
   ``The scenario goes that if an NFC team wins by 20 points or
more, then the market has gone up that year 95 percent of the
time,'' said Richard Ciardullo, head trader for Raymond, James &amp;
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   ``That's why I rooted for the 49ers.''

   US Sprint said Monday some customers
will be able to place long-distance calls with their voices by
summer in what would be the first voice-activated dialing offered
by a long-distance company.
   Sprint said the new service, targeted toward business travelers,
would allow a caller to use a spoken password instead of a standard
long-distance travel card, which requires callers to punch in as
many as 24 digits.
   In addition, a caller could speed-dial certain pre-registered
numbers by saying passwords such as ``call home'' into a phone.
   The company said the new system would provide greater security
against unauthorized use of calling cards by ensuring the caller's
voice matched a pre-registered voice pattern.
   ``These are the features the  tells us they
want,'' said Sydtraveling public Courson, spokesman for Kansas City-based
Sprint,
the nation's third-largest long-distance company.
   Sprint unveiled the service Sunday in commercials broadcast
during the Super Bowl.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it has the technology to
offer similar voice-activated services and is doing trials to
determine what specific features are in demand. AT&amp;T spokeswoman
Fran Anderson said some products could be announced in 1990.
   A spokesman for MCI Communt system will be available to several hundred
thousand customers by early this summer, but Courson would not
specify what markets would get it first or what it would cost.
   Testing on the system began in December 1988, said Larry Lake,
senior vice president of product management.
   US Sprint, which controls about 8 percent of the domestic
long-distance market, is an 80-percent-owned subsidiary of United
Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City. GTE Corp., of Stamford,
Conn., owns the remaining 20 percent.

   The stock market settled broadly lower in
volatile trading Monday, pressured by interest rate worries and
concern about financing of corporate takeovers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 5.85 points to
2,553.38.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
961 issues down, 541 up and 450 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.77 million
shares, down from 198.19 million in the previous session.
   Stock traders said the market tried to rally several times
throughout the session, starting at the opening bell, but failed to
muster enthusiasm as many institutional investors remained on the
sidelines. Program trading kept the market fluctuating wildly.
   ``Program trading was a very large part,'' said Phillip Puccio,
managing director of equity trading for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``Futures seemed to be wagging the dog. With institutional
trading you would see more liquidity and less volatility.''
   Junk bond market woes spilled over into the stock market,
pressuring takeover-related issues and helping drive the market
lower, said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Many large corporate buyouts in recent years
were financed with junk bonds.
   Transportation issues were among the hardest hit. The Dow Jones
transportation average fell 26.67 to 1,074.50.
   ``The junk bond market has been in disarray. That's hurting deal
stocks,'' said Weeks.
   Interest rates and the level of foreign investment in U.S.
securities also remained a chief concern for the stock and bond
markets. Investors worry that foreign investors will avoid buying
U.S. securities and financing the U.S. government budget deficit
because interest rates are higher overseas.
   A poor showing particularly by Japanese investors during the
Treasury's refunding auction next week could force the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign investment.
   Higher interest rates would make government securities more
competitive _ a negative for the stock market, Weeks said.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.16 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $12.171 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.48 to 179.73.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Varity fell &lsqb; to 3,
Security Pacific lost &rsqb; to 35\, General Electric was off } to 61}
and Philip Morris was unchanged at 37.
   UAL also tumbled 13{ 136{, as junk bond worries raised concerns
about the success of a union-proposed buyout offer, and AMR lost 2&lsqb;

   Meanwhile, AT&amp;T rose &rsqb; to 39{, Bank of New England gained | to

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.27 to 374.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index closed down 0.60 at 325.20.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

   The government banned some uses of the color
additive Red No. 3 on Monday. As a result, ``red'' may not be as
``red'' in lipstick, cake frostings, cough drops and some processed
fruits and juices.
   The Food and Drug Administration announcement said some uses of
the dye are being halted because Red No. 3 in high doses has been
shown to cause cancer in rats.
   The cancer risk is considered so small that the FDA said that
existing products that contain the color may be used. The ban on
Red No. 3 will apply only to new manufacturing, the FDA said.
   The FDA action prevents the use of the red dye in products where
the color is mixed chemically with another additive.
   Direct addition of the dye to a product will continue, but the
FDA also announced its intention to halt this use eventually.
   Under the new rules, FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said Red No. 3
can no longer be used in any cosmetic product, including lipsticks,
powders, blushes, shampoos, skin care lotions or bath oils.
   It also is excluded from use in cake frostings, cough drops,
herbs and spices, flavorings, some processed fruits and juices,
chewing gum, cake mixes and dietary foods. Even the wax on cheeses
can no longer contain the red dye, said Corwin.
   Red No. 3 is one of seven primary colors approved for food, drug
and cosmetic use, but it holds a very important position because it
is the ``closest to primary red,'' says John Hallagan of the
Certified Color Manufacturers Association.
   ``There will be a number of products that won't be red any
more,'' said Hallagan.
   The six other colors are Red No. 40, Blue Nos. 1 and 2, Green
No. 3, and Yellow Nos. 5 and 6.
   ``Because it was closest to the primary color of red, No. 3 is
ideal for blending,'' said Hallagan. Mixing No. 3 with other
primary colors could make a whole variety of shades based on red,
ranging from orange to maroon.
   Without No. 3, he said, ``the pallet of colors will be reduced
significantly. The variability will be reduced.''
   Red No. 40, he said, is a different shade of red and is not as
stable.
   Hallagan said that about 300,000 pounds of Red No. 3 is
manufactured annually in the United States.
   Irene Malbin of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association
said that a 1989 survey of cosmetic manufacturers showed that red
No. 3 ``was not used in very many cosmetic products'' because of
uncertainty over its status.
   As a result, dropping red No. 3 from cosmetic use will not have
a serious effect on the colors available to customers, said Ms.
Malbin.
   But association president Ed Kavanaugh attacked the FDA action
as being ``arbitrary and capricious'' because the agency permitted
Red No. 3 to continue to be used in food ``and other ingested
products.''
   Under the FDA order, Red No. 3 still can be applied directly to
some products until further agency action is taken.
   That means it still can be applied directly to meat, pet food,
nut products, fruit and fruit juices, candy and confections,
breakfast cereals and ingested drugs.
   Corwin said the cherries in fruit cocktail, for example, can
continue to be tinted red by the color additive.
   In announcing the FDA action, Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services, said: ``The actual
risk posed by red No. 3 is extremely small. However, federal law in
this area is clear. There have been laboratory studies which showed
that very high doses of Red No. 3, administered directly in the
diet, caused cancer in rats.''
   Sullivan said that Congress should consider updating the
statutes ``to reflect advances in the methods of scientific
assessment that were not available when the law was originally
passed in 1960.''
   An FDA statement said the risk of getting cancer from Red No. 3
is no larger than 1 in 100,000 over a lifetime of consumption. This
compares to a natural disaster risk of about 70 in 100,000, and a
risk from death in railroad or air crashes of about 6 in 100,000,
the agency said.

<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. will delay shipments of its
new Deskpro 486-25 personal computer because of a faulty Intel
Corp. chip, officials said Monday. It is the second problem found
in the advanced microprocessor.
   ``About a week ago, on Monday, we were contacted by Intel just
saying that there was an errata discovered in the 486 chip,'' said
Nora Rice, media relations administrator for the Houston-based
computer manufacturer.
   She said Intel said it was working to find a solution to the
problem, but the trouble will delay introduction of the new machine.
   ``We were targeting shipping the computer Feb. 1,'' Ms. Rice
said. ``But with this new errata, it will delay the ship date.
   ``It's important to understand what's causing the problem,
before you put in a fix or a work-around'' that configures the
computer differently, she said.
   Compaq discovered another problem with the advanced chip last
fall, before Intel had begun shipping the microprocessor.
   When Compaq unveiled the Deskpro 486-25 last November it called
it the most powerful desktop computer yet.
   Intel's 486 chip, introduced last April, is so powerful that it
will allow personal computers to do certain jobs now done by
engineering workstations, minicomputers and even mainframes.
   The most recent trouble could affect other computers using the
Extended Industry Standard Architecture, or EISA, 32-bit bus, Ms.
Rice said.
   Compaq has not released any of its other 486-based machines, Ms.
Rice said.
   ``I think they will be delayed, but it's safe to say they will
be out within the first quarter.''

   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
in light trading Monday in reaction to a drop in stock prices.
   Gold prices also slipped. On New York's Commodity Exchange, a
troy ounce of gold fell $1 to close at $419.10. Republic National
Bank later quoted a bid of $418.20 a troy ounce, down $1.80 from
Friday.
   Dealers said the dollar began trading higher in New York after
it lost strength overnight on overseas markets, where the West
German mark rose in value against the dollar in reaction to an
announcement of earlier elections in East Germany and an easing of
tension in Soviet Azerbaijan.
   But then stock prices fell on Wall Street, sending the dollar
lower. prevailed in Europe and in New York in the morning before
the stock market began weakening.
   Recent economic reports that indicate the U.S. economy is
sluggish also worked against the dollar, said Robert Hatcher, a
dealer with Barclays Bank PLC.
   ``I think it is resurrecting the fear within the dealer
community of possible ... easing down the road,'' he said. Lower
interest rates as set by the Federal Reserve Board make the dollar
less attractive to overseas investors.
   Reports Monday showing consumer spending posted its largest
increase in three years in 1989 and personal incomes rose 9 percent
last year had little impact on the dollar, traders said.
   Charles A. Spence, a vice president at First Interstate Bank in
Los Angeles, said currency dealers were awaiting the release
Wednesday of the Commerce Department's leading indicators for
December, which should give further evidence on the direction of
the economy.
   ``They're looking for slightly positive numbers,'' he said.
   Earlier, dealers overseas said a few large orders had an
exaggerated impact on the dollar because volume was thin with Hong
Kong and Singapore closed for holidays.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 143.22 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.15 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 142.98 yen, up 0.18 yen from Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6775 from $1.6571 late
Friday. In New York, it strengthened further to $1.6810, up from
$1.6635 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday
rates, included: 1.6770 West German marks, down from 1.6865; 1.4815
Swiss francs, down from 1.4900; 5.6950 French francs, down from
5.7290; 1,248.00 Italian lire, down from 1,254.50; and 1.1871
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1966.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.6795 West German marks, down from 1.6935; 1.4860 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4975; 5.7040 French francs, down from 5.7510; 1.8865
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9060; 1,249.75 Italian lire, down from
1,260.00; 1.1888 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1903;
   Gold dipped in London to a late bid price of $418.50 a troy
ounce from $418.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold finished at a closing bid of $418.50, unchanged
from late Friday.
   There was no gold trading in Hong Kong, which was closed for the
Lunar New Year holiday. The market there is to reopen Tuesday.
   Silver prices fell marginally. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery finished at $5.215 a troy ounce, down
from $5.222 a troy ounce Friday. It fell in London to a late bid
price of $5.22 a troy ounce from $5.25 Friday.

<HEAD>Ford Employees Return to Work as Union Dissidence Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one-third of the workers at Ford Motor
Co.'s plant outside Mexico City returned to work Monday after a
labor dispute that sparked a 22-day shutdown, a Ford spokesman said.
   Spokesman Carlos Bandala said 1,200 union employees went back to
work at the Cuautitlan plant 15 miles north of Mexico City and
another 1,200 were expected to rejoin the labor force Tuesday.
   ``We expect to resume full operation probably by the end of this
week,'' Bandala said.
   The 3,800-member work force produces 450 cars and trucks a day
for the Mexican market under normal conditions. Current production
figures were unavailable, he said.
   One worker was killed and nine others injured in a Jan. 8
confrontation among employees at the plant. Between 150 and 200
people entered the plant and shot and beat workers as they arrived
for the morning shift. Ford closed the plant, saying there was no
security for workers.
   After the flareup, protesting unionists took over Ford
installations demanding the ouster of union leader Hector Uriarte.
Authorities issued an arrest warrant charging Uriarte with
masterminding the violence.
   Newspaper reports Monday said dissident union members were
maintaining a picket outside the company installations.
   Bandala said the company is negotiating with Fidel Velazquez,
head of the Mexican Labor Confederation, to which the Ford union
belongs. Negotiations will determine whether union members receive
back pay for work time lost when the company closed the plant.
   Union legal adviser Gerardo Cabazos Cortez said the safety of
returning workers is guaranteed.

   Unocal Corp. said Monday that it lost $26
million in its fourth quarter and its yearly profit fell 46 percent
because of a loss on the sale of a coal mine and other one-time
unusual events.
   The loss for the October-December quarter, equivalent to 11
cents per share, came on revenues of $2.85 billion. In
fourth-quarter 1988, Unocal earned $141 million, or 60 cents a
share, on revenues of $2.85 billion. That included sale of the
Unocal headquarters property in Los Angeles.
   For the year, the big energy company earned $260 million, or
$1.11 per share, on sales of $11.36 billion, compared to $480
million, $2.06 per share, on revenues of $10.15 billion in 1988.
   The 1989 net earnings include a $98 million loss related to the
sale of the Obed Mountain coal mine in Canada, a discontinued
operation. In 1988, net earnings included a $456 million gain from
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.
   Excluding the loss from discontinued coal operations, Unocal
would have earned $60 million in the fourth quarter, the company
said.
   After adjusting for one-time events, earnings for 1989 were up
by 24 percent over the previous year, Chairman Richard J.
Stegemeier said. The gain reflected improved petroleum exploration
and production earnings, including settlements of several natural
gas contract disputes, which were partially offset by lower
refining and marketing earnings.

   A top Apple Computer Inc. executive
resigned Monday in what analysts called part of the company's drive
to resolve problems in switching to a new generation of products.
   Cupertino-based Apple, the world's No. 2 personal computer
maker, has faced declining profits for nearly a year, mostly due to
poor U.S. sales.
   Company officials announced the resignation of Allan Z. Loren as
president of Apple USA, the company's foundering domestic sales and
marketing unit. Loren, 51, a former insurance executive, once was
considered a candidate to head the company.
   ``Apple has been in a hunkered-down mode since before Christmas
and it is trying to put itself back onto the road, and this is a
message it is making a major move in that direction,'' said Richard
Shaffer, publisher of New York-based Technologic Computer Letter.
   Michael H. Spindler, 47, president of Apple Europe, was named
chief operating officer by John Sculley, chief executive and
company president.
   The new position is designed to help the company improve
coordination of business operations and streamline day-to-day
activities, Apple said in a statement.
   The company's latest financial results apparently sealed Loren's
fate.
   During its latest quarter, Apple suffered an 11 percent decline
in profits from a year earlier. It was the third straight quarter
Apple experienced a decline in revenue and profits, with most of
the problems centered on the U.S. sales and marketing division, the
company's largest.
   Apple, which had revenues of $5.3 billion in 1989, said two
weeks ago it would reduce employment by 5,500, mostly through
attrition and reassignment, and would not rule out the possibility
of layoffs.
   It also froze salaries for six months, eliminated cars for
U.S.-based executives and cut back its profit-sharing plan.
   Apple faces a critical year in 1990 from major competitors who
will be introducing their own graphic interface products, which are
software programs that use symbols to allow the user to tell
computers what to do.
   Apple's Macintosh has been the leading computer to use such a
system, but there have been delays in releasing its newest
Macintosh machines and criticisms they are too expensive.
   Benny Lorenzo, an analyst at Volpe Convington &amp; Welty in San
Francisco, said Aple has worried some investors by the level of its
research and development expenses.
   He said Compaq Computer Corp. spent 5.3 percent of its revenue
on research and development last year, compared to Apple's 8
percent, yet came out with more new computers.
   Although the personal computer industry in general has been hurt
by sagging sales the past six months, Apple also was beset by
significantly slower U.S. sales of some of its leading product
lines, particularly low-end Macintosh models and the Apple II
personal computers.
   Many software distributors have been angry over the
comparatively low level of promotion by Apple last Christmas for
its Apple II, developed 13 years ago. Many dealers and owners of
the machine fear the company is preparing to abandon it in favor of
the Macintosh.
   Apple also has been hurt by declining sales of peripheral
equipment because of increased competition and lower minimum
purchase requirements for major resellers, which encouraged the
companies to order lower volumes, Lorenzo said.
   ``What's happened is that they've neglected the low-end of the
market and concentrated on maintaining or increasing their share of
the business part of the market,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. of New York.
   Sales figures by Storeboard Inc., a Dallas market researcher,
show that unit sales of Apple computers through U.S. dealers
decreased last year, while revenue increased, indicating at least
in part a shift toward more expensive machines.
   Many of Apple's longtime customers want the company to put more
effort into software for its less costly machines and to introduce
better versions of those products without drastically increasing
price.

<HEAD>Disagreement From Trump And Resorts Bondholders Over Court
Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware court has ruled that the
board of Resorts International, Inc., then headed by Donald Trump,
acted in good faith when it approved a $36-a-share offer by
entertainer Merv Griffin.
   Trump hailed the ruling as ``a great victory'' and said it would
forestall any attempt by Resorts bondholders to sue him, but an
attorney for some bondholders disputed that contention.
   In a decision reached Friday but announced Monday, the Delaware
Supreme Court Court upheld a lower courts ruling that it was
``doubtful'' any objecting shareholders could prove the board of
directors' committee acted with gross negligence or bad faith in
approving Griffin's bid in June 1988.
   The court also dismissed the contention of shareholders who said
they did not benefit from the deal between Griffin and Trump. The
court said they received $36 a share from Griffin when Trump had
offered only $22 a share.
   Resorts is incorporated in Delaware.
   Trump had been Resorts chairman and controlling stockholder
before Griffin bought the casino company, taking on more than $900
million in debt and issuing bonds to finance that debt.
   Trump was paid $63.7 million to break his management contract
with Resorts. He also received the unfinished Taj Mahal casino for
$250 million, half the $500 million Resorts had sunk into
construction.
   In a telephone interview from New York, Trump called the
decision ``a great victory'' and said it would end speculation
about disgruntled bondholders suing Trump for alleged ``fradulent
conveyances.''
   ``We're really very happy about it,'' Trump said. ``It puts to
rest any loose ends.''
   As part of a bankruptcy reorganization plan filed late last year
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden by Resorts International,
Griffin set aside a $5 million kitty for possible legal action
against Trump.
   Attorneys for some bondholder groups had said they might sue
Trump for ``fraudulent conveyance.''
   Resorts attorney Tom Gallagher said the decision would not have
any impact on the reorganization plan.
   ``The ruling is as expected,'' Gallagher said. ``There's nothing
new in it.''
   Marc S. Kirschner, an attorney for some Resorts bondholders,
discounted the importance of the ruling.
   ``I think it's irrelevant,'' he said. ``It has to do with
shareholder rights and remedies and has zero to do with creditor
rights and remedies.''
   Most analysts say Griffin paid too much for Resorts and burdened
his purchase with too much debt, estimated at about $912 million.
   Griffin's bankruptcy plan, which still must win approval from
bondholders and state gaming regulators, would have him exchange 78
percent of his equity in the company for about two-thirds of the
outstanding debt.
   The ``win'' or gross profits for Resorts dropped last year to
$227.4 million from the $242.9 million posted in 1988, according to
the state Casino Control Commission.

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black &amp; Decker Corp. posted a net loss of
$3.2 million in the final three months of 1989 because of higher
interest costs and the writeoff of goodwill following its
acquisition of Emhart Corp., the company announced.
   The quarterly loss, which amounted to 5 cents a share, compared
with net income of $38 million, or 65 cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
   Operating income, which is calculated before interest and taxes,
rose 80 percent in the quarter to $116 million, reflecting the
Emhart acquisition and double-digit operating income growth in
existing Black &amp; Decker businesses.
   Sales rose 60 percent to $1.1 billion.
   The period constitutes a ``stub'' period following the decision
by the power tool and home products company to change in its fiscal
year end from the last Sunday in September to Dec. 31.
   Black &amp; Decker aquired Emhart, a diversified producer of
industrial and commercial products, for $2.8 billion last spring.
   The company also announced it has completed the sale of its
Bostik adhesives business, a part of the Emhart acquisition, to
Orkem SA of France for $345 million. Proceeds of the sale will be
used to reduce debt, the company said.
   The company also plans to sell two other businesses _ its
footwear materials unit to United Machinery Group Ltd. for $125
million and its capacitors business, excluding the U.S. segment, to
Nissei Electric Co. Ltd. for $80 million. Both transactions are
subject to negotiation of final contracts, the company said.

   America West Airlines has ordered two Boeing
747-400s and taken options on two more, Boeing Commercial Airplanes
said Monday.
   The order, along with spare parts and training, is worth about
$280 million, Boeing said.
   America West, based in Phoenix, plans to use the jumbo jets on
flights to Hawaii. Engines for the new planes have not yet been
chosen.
   Boeing now has received orders for 246 of the long-range
747-400s from 26 customers.

   An investment group said it intends to wage a
proxy fight to gain control of National Intergroup Inc., a
Pittsburgh-based holding company.
   Centaur Partners IV, based in New York, said Monday in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it and other
investors have acquired 16.53 percent of NII's stock and hope to
restructure or sell the company.
   The move was seen as hostile by NII, which issued a statement
saying Centaur Partners ``have nothing to add to the existing
restructuring program which the company has been actively pursuing
for the past year.''
   The company said it already had sold its aluminum fabrication
businesses for $135 million and made progress in negotiating the
sale of the rest of its aluminum and steel operations. The company
plans to concentrate its operations on pharmaceuticals and oil.
   NII said it expects a significant increase in earnings in fiscal
1990.
   Also Monday, Centaur asked the Delaware Chancery Court to
prevent NII from triggering a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover device.
The technique would allow NII to issue stock purchase rights to
shareholders 10 days after a hostile investor gains a stake of 10
percent or more in the company.
   NII's stock, which has swung widely in value during the past
year because of takeover speculation, lost $2 a share Monday to
close at $15.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
