   The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was
the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Here is a chronology of
the case:
   _Aug. 12, 1983: Judy Johnson makes a phone call to Manhattan
Beach Police Department and tells Detective Jane Hoag that she
believes her 2 1@2 -year-old son was molested by Raymond Buckey at
the McMartin Pre-School.
   _Sept. 7, 1983: Ms. Hoag arrests Buckey, but he is released
later that day for lack of evidence. Police continue the
investigation and stir controversy by sending letters to 200
parents naming Buckey as a child molestation suspect and asking
them to interrogate their children about oral sex, fondling of
genitals and sodomy.
   _Fall of 1983 to spring of 1984: Nearly 400 children are
interviewed by Children's Institute International, and 41 are
listed as victims in a complaint filed by the state.
   _March 22, 1984: Public outcry prompts Los Angeles District
Attorney Robert Philibosian to send the case to grand jurors, who
indict Buckey; his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey; his sister, Peggy
Ann Buckey; his grandmother Virginia McMartin, and three employees,
Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty Raidor, on 115 charges
of child molestation.
   _March 24, 1984: All seven defendants are arrested and jailed.
Buckey and his mother are held without bail. Bail for he others
ranges from $50,000 to $350,000.
   _April 20, 1984: The seven defendants plead innocent at an
arraignment, during which they are charged with sexually abusing 18
children over 10 years and using death threats to silence them.
   _June 6, 1984: A preliminary hearing starts with Municipal Judge
Aviva K. Bobb presiding. Thirteen of the alleged victims take the
stand during the 18-month hearing.
   _Jan. 22, 1985: The first child witness in the preliminary
hearing testifies that he and other pupils played ``naked games''
and that he had been touched on his genitals by some of the
defendants.
   _Jan. 9, 1986: Judge Bobb orders all seven defendants to stand
trial in Superior Court on 135 counts of molestation and
conspiracy, ending the longest preliminary hearing in California
history. The cost of the hearing was estimated at $4 million.
   _Jan. 17, 1986: District Attorney Ira Reiner says there is
insufficient evidence to warrant a trial for five of the seven
defendants and asks dismissal of charges against Virginia McMartin,
Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty
Raidor. The remaining defendants, Buckey and his mother, still face
100 counts of molestation and conspiracy.
   _Jan. 23, 1986: Mrs. Buckey is released on $295,000 bail,
reduced from $495,000.
   _July 13, 1987: Opening statements begin after efforts to move
the case elsewhere are quashed by Superior Court Judge William R.
Pounders.
   _July 29, 1987: The first parent to testify says his daughter's
behavior indicates she may have been abused at the school, but he
didn't recognize the warning signs at the time.
   _Oct. 17, 1988: The judge dismisses eight molestation counts
against Buckey and his mother. They now face a combined 65 counts
of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 former McMartin pupils.
   _Feb. 15, 1989: Buckey is released on $1.5 million bail after
being jailed nearly five years.
   _April 27, 1989: The trial, hitting the 2-year, 4-day mark,
becomes the longest criminal hearing in U.S. history when it
surpasses by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono
in 1982-83.
   _May 16, 1989: Peggy McMartin Buckey takes the stand for the
first time and strongly denies she ever sexually assaulted her
students.
   _July 26, 1989: Buckey takes the stand and denies he has ever
molested children.
   _Nov. 2, 1989: Jurors adjourn to select a foreman and begin
deliberations. _Jan. 18, 1990: The jury acquits Buckey and his
mother of 52 counts. The judge declares a mistrial on 13 other
counts _ 12 against Buckey and one against both Buckey and his
mother.
   _Jan. 31: Reiner, after consulting with McMartin parents who
want a Buckey retrial, decides to pursue some of the 13 counts the
jury deadlocked on in the first trial.
   _April 10: Jury selection begins in Buckey's second trial with a
new judge presiding, Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg.
   _July 27: On their 15th day of deliberations, jurors ask
Weisberg to return the two verdicts. They recast their votes. They
then tell the judge they are hopelessly deadlocked on all eight
counts. The judge declares a mistrial. Prosecutors say there will
be no third trial.

   In the history of American jurisprudence, no
criminal prosecution has lasted longer nor taken a greater toll
financially and emotionally than the McMartin Pre-School
molestation case.
   Reputations were ruined and lives were shattered. A school was
demolished and the justice system took a beating as McMartin became
a symbol of legal excess.
   Seven years and $13.5 million after it began, the last act in
the saga of Raymond Buckey and the teachers of the McMartin school
was played out Friday in a Los Angeles courtroom.
   A mistrial was declared in Buckey's retrial after the jury said
it was hopelessly deadlocked on eight child molestation counts.
District Attorney Ira Reiner said there would not be a third trial.
   Buckey, once among seven defendants, sat alone before the jury
in his second trial. Six women _ including his mother, sister and
grandmother _ were cleared in earlier proceedings.
   The abbreviated second trial, lasting three months, was a sharp
contrast to the first marathon McMartin trial which stretched to
nearly three years. An 18-month preliminary hearing had preceded
that case.
   As months and years passed in the McMartin case, a new decade
dawned and time became the enemy of the truth-seeking process.
   The children who were alleged to have been molested at the
Manhattan Beach nursery school grew up. In the second trial,
one-time toddlers grown to adolescence strained to remember on the
witness stand a time now lost in the dim haze of childhood memories.
   They furrowed their brows, searching for answers, saying again
and again: ``I don't remember.''
   ``The truth never had a chance,'' Buckey's attorney, Danny
Davis, told jurors in closing arguments. ``We never heard from the
children. We heard from little adults.''
   Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero told the jurors, ``This
particular case boils down to credibility. Who do you believe? If
you believe the children, then the people have proved their case
beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Buckey took the stand at both trials and denied ever molesting
any children.
   The young girls said they were molested by Buckey, but their
recollection of details was sketchy. One girl who earlier accused
Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of lewd acts shocked
participants in the second trial by calmly saying under oath that
none of it was true. Mrs. Buckey, 63, who spent two years in jail
and three years on trial based on such accusations, had already
been acquitted.
   Time also changed Raymond Buckey. He spent five years in jail
awaiting resolution of his case until a judge decided he should be
released on $1.5 million bail. He emerged a seemingly different
person. The gangly, self-conscious 25-year-old who was arrested in
1983 had matured into a man of 32, carefully groomed, articulate
and confident as he faced TV cameras for daily hallway interviews,
proclaiming his innocence.
   ``It's been close to seven years of my life and now it's come to
a finale, McMartin Two, the summer rerun,'' Buckey told reporters
one day.
   And after the trial, his only occupation for years?
   ``I don't know what I'll do,'' he said, ``maybe grow Christmas
trees in Oregon, maybe give advice on how you survive a witch
hunt.''
   Moments before his second mistrial was declared, Buckey summed
it up this way: ``I've gone from probably one of the most hated
people you could ever mention ... to a point of where, everybody
that comes up to me now is very sympathetic, and they're saying `I
always thought you were innocent.'''
   The first trial was a gut-wrenching drama starring prosecutors
and defense attorneys seemingly obsessed with the case. Parents of
McMartin children crowded the courtroom to watch 124 witnesses. TV
and newspapers trumpeted bizarre allegations of satanic rituals,
animal sacrifices and supernatural occurrences at the school.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who presided at the first
trial, said the case poisoned everyone who touched it. The mother
whose first molestation report ignited the wildfire of accusations
died of alcoholism before the trial began. A defense investigator
committed suicide during the trial.
   The second trial, which began April 6, was a toned-down affair.
Except for Buckey and his attorney, Danny Davis, the cast of
characters had changed. A new judge presided and two new
prosecutors seemed determined to remain detached from the passions
that consumed their predecessors.
   The McMartin school was closed and ultimately demolished after
parents excavated the grounds in search of underground tunnels
where they believed children had been molested. They turned up
little conclusive evidence.
   Teachers' reputations were destroyed and some of them moved away
to escape the stigma.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner's political career also fell victim
to the McMartin case. When the first jury deadlocked on 13 charges
against Buckey, parents pressured Reiner to refile the counts.
Buckey had been acquitted on another 40 counts.
   Reiner, then a candidate for state attorney general, decided to
reprosecute Buckey on eight charges involving three children. The
McMartin case was widely blamed for Reiner's election defeat in the
June primary.

   Garlic lovers will savor garlic bread,
garlic soup, garlic squid, garlic veggies and even garlic cake and
ice cream at a California town's annual festival celebrating the
pungent herb.
   ``I've been going for 12 years, and I still haven't got close to
sampling everything you can eat in one weekend,'' said J. Chris
Dowell, who is helping to organize the three-day Gilroy Garlic
Festival, which opened Friday. Gilroy is situated 30 miles south of
San Jose.
   The food festival was started in 1979 to boost the town's claim
to be the Garlic Capital of the World _ even though the Fresno area
produces most of the state's garlic.
   More than 140,000 people attended last year, devouring 77,760
servings of garlic bread, 35,135 helpings of pasta con pesto and
24,835 pepper steak sandwiches. Nearly 30,000 gallons of beer and
28,000 glasses of wine washed down the aromatic meals.
   The attendance is expected to rise this year to around 150,000,
organizers said.
   Food booths make use of more than a ton of minced fresh garlic.
The festival features a recipe contest, cooking demonstrations by
noted chefs and displays of garlic-inspired art.

<HEAD>After Months of Legal Arguments, Florida Executes Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After two months of legal arguments that
held up six death sentences, Florida proved its electric chair
works by executing a killer who said he felt no guilt for robbing,
raping and stabbing a woman.
   Anthony Bertolotti, 38, died Friday evening in the first
electrocution carried out by the state since May 4, when flame and
smoke shot from the headpiece of the electric chair during the
execution of Jesse Tafero.
   State and federal courts stayed the executions of Bertolotti and
five other death row inmates while considering arguments from
defense lawyers that the 66-year-old chair would torture their
clients to death.
   An Orlando trial court conducted tests on the chair and ruled
Wednesday it was fit for use. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeal and
the U.S. Supreme Court concurred, and the execution went forward
Friday evening.
   Bertolotti jerked back in the chair, clenched his fists and
slumped after each of the three surges administered by the hooded
executioner.
   There were white whisps of smoke, as is usual for the
electrocutions, but no signs of malfunction. Bertolotti was
declared dead at 7:07 p.m.
   The execution was Florida's 23rd since it resumed capital
punishment in 1979, and the 136th in the nation since the Supreme
Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
   The state had concluded that an artificial sponge _ used in
place of a natural sponge under the electrode in the headpiece _
burst into flame during the Tafero electrocution. Gov. Bob Martinez
said the sponge had been replaced and the chair worked properly.
   Bertolotti's lawyers lost their argument that the chair was
faulty in a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge G. Kendall
Sharp in Orlando.
   A three-judge panel rejected the condemned man's claim that
Sharp's ruling was unfounded, and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected
the case after taking it up about half an hour before the sentence
was carried out.
   ``It is gratifying that the courts concluded Florida's electric
chair does in fact work as it is designed to. That fact was borne
out by extensive testing earlier this week, and the completion of
this execution proves it conclusively,'' Martinez said.
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeal held up three other death
warrants and state courts held up two others while the chair's
function was tested. Other matters of appeal stood in the way of
some of those death sentences.
   Bertolotti was sentenced to die for the Sept. 27, 1983, murder
of Carol Ward, 48, of Orlando. She was working in her yard when
Bertolotti approached and asked to use the telephone, and she let
him in.
   He grabbed a knife and robbed her of $30, then stabbed her
repeatedly until the knife broke. He found another knife and
stabbed her until she died, leaving the knife in her body. At some
point, Bertolotti removed her clothes and raped her. He was
convicted March 31, 1984.
   Bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors after his
conviction, saying he wasn't sorry.
   ``I have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of Carol Ward,''
he wrote. She ``should have locked her damn door. I really did a
favor by taking her life, don't you think so?''

<HEAD>Indictment by Innuendo: Serial Murder Suspects Known But Never

   Two years after investigators in New Bedford began
tracking leads in the serial killings of at least nine women,
attorney Kenneth Ponte's name has been printed in many places, but
not on an arrest warrant.
   He blames the prosecutor for floating his name.
   ``He's ruined my career as a lawyer. He's ruined my life,''
Ponte, 40, said Thursday in an interview from Florida.
   ``When I walk up or down any street little kids call me
murderer.''
   Those statements chafe Bristol County District Attorney Ronald
Pina, whose office has never publicly identified a suspect in the
deaths.
   ``It's irritating because it's easy to say it's the district
attorney's fault,'' Pina's spokesman, Jim Martin, said recently.
   Ponte is neither the first, nor the only, victim of innuendo.
   The guilt of four different men has been widely speculated upon
since the case heated up in the fall 1988; however, none has been
charged.
   Today, only Ponte's name still shows up regularly in headlines.
At last count, he said, 254 newspaper articles had linked his name
with the case.
   ``He's been painted for a long period of time with the brush of
being the suspected serial killer and that ... will never rub
off,'' said Edward F. Harrington, an attorney for a ``suspect'' who
fell out of vogue months ago.
   Jonathan Klarfeld, director of Boston University's print
journalism program, finds fault with law enforcement authorities
for floating such stories.
   ``If there's fault on the part of the media, it's in letting
themselves be used in this way,'' he said.
   Ponte knew several of the victims _ all drug users, some
prostitutes. Their bodies turned up along highways in southeastern
Massachusetts between July 1988 and April 1989.
   Though convicted long ago on charges including narcotics and
breaking and entering, Ponte received a pardon from Gov. Francis
Sargent in 1975, legally clearing his slate.
   ``If (Pina) thinks I did something and he thinks he has
evidence, then charge me and let me come into court,'' Ponte said
Thursday. ``But to harass me and indict me by publication for two
years? I've been punished more than most people who have been
convicted of serious crimes.''
   Harrington said his client, like Ponte, has not been the same
since his name was dragged into the investigation. Anthony DeGrazia
was arrested on rape and assault and battery charges at the height
of the investigation in May 1989.
   ``Almost overnight after his interview with the DA's office, he
was put in the limelight as being the latest suspect in the highway
serial killings,'' Harrington said. ``He couldn't raise his head
above his shoulders because people were pointing him out on the
street.''
   Martin said the district attorney's office has been chagrined to
watch the parade of alleged suspects trotted out.
   ``For a while, in a not-so-funny joke, it became `the suspect of
the week,''' he acknowledged.
   But don't lay the blame with the district attorney, Martin said,
adding:
   ``I don't fault the media for doing their job ... what does
become a problem is when the reporting oversteps the line and
becomes the investigation.''
   Ponte moved to Port Richey, Fla., in 1988 and was arrested there
June 12 for allegedly assaulting a woman. He was released two weeks
ago on personal recognizance because prosecutors produced no
evidence against him.
   After his release, Ponte wanted to return to New Bedford to stay
with his 65-year-old mother.
   He wanted to clear his name, but a bizarre twist stopped him
short.
   Ponte said his mother unwittingly bought a house next door to
Pina last year. When the district attorney heard of Ponte's plans,
he obtained a restraining order based on secret grand jury
testimony presented to a judge.
   A witness claimed Ponte told her he intended to kill the
district attorney, his wife and daughter. The witness later
disputed the characterization of her testimony.
   But Ponte suggested that Pina, who's up for re-election this
year, sought the order for reasons other than concern for his
family's safety.
   ``The first rule of any politician is to get re-elected,'' Ponte
said. ``If he drops me as a suspect, he's admitting to the public
that he's wasted their money. He's got to hang this on somebody.''

   Dozens of the nation's top filmmakers,
convinced the film rating system makes no sense, are asking the
Motion Picture Association of America to overhaul its cinematic
score sheet.
   ``It doesn't work,'' said Barry Levinson, the Oscar-winning
director of ``Rain Man'' and other hits. ``It's a poor system to
begin with.''
   Levinson is among 31 prestigious filmmakers who signed a
petition that was delivered Tuesday to the MPAA. Other signers
included Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Mazursky, Spike Lee and Sydney
Pollack.
   The outcry _ prompted by X ratings given to several critically
acclaimed films _ has grown so intense that the president of the
MPAA says he'll listen to the directors' criticisms.
   But Jack Valenti's attentive ear is unlikely to end the debate
since he says he has no intention of changing the rules.
   A New York state judge, while upholding the X rating of ``Tie Me
Up! Tie Me Down!'' on July 19, criticized the rating system. Judge
Charles Ramos said it borders on censorship and if not reformed may
face legal challenges.
   Many directors and producers say the X rating amounts to a kiss
of death at the box office because it is synonymous with hard-core,
graphic, sexual films. It should not be used to label mature-themed
films of higher artistic ambition, they say.
   An A rating, these filmmakers suggest, should be created for
non-pornographic adult films.
   ``The X rating has come to represent pornography,'' said Harvey
Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, whose releases include
``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' and another X-rated movie ``The Cook,
The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover.''
   ``The X rating of `Midnight Cowboy' and `A Clockwork Orange' is
now confused with the X rating of `Debbie Does Dallas.'''
   Wayne Wang, the well-regarded director of the recently X-rated
feature ``Talk is Cheap ... But Toilet Paper is Expensive,'' said,
``We tried to make a film to comment on violence and pornography
and we are told that we are violent and pornographic ourselves.
   ``The world is changing. And the rating system should change
with it.''
   In May, the National Society of Film Critics pressed for the new
A rating. Valenti said this week he intended to meet with some of
the directors petitioning for the change. But he maintains that the
rating procedure works.
   ``If you add another category, you're asking the rating board to
make judgments about artistic integrity,'' he said. ``Trying to
decide which film about bestiality and incest is artistic and
therefore deserves an A rating and which film about bestiality and
incest is not artistic and therefore deserves an X rating is
impossible.''
   Valenti said the X rating is not equivalent to pornography. ``It
means it is an adult film.'' No reasonable parent, he said, would
let children see the films the MPAA rates X.
   He said parents are happy with the work of the 11-member ratings
board.
   Richard Heffner, chairman of the MPAA's classification and
rating administration, said the identities of the film raters are
kept secret so they won't be unfairly pressured. But he said all
are parents.
   Heffner said the number of films getting a ``tentative X''
rating from the board has been consistent. In the past, he said,
filmmakers drawing these preliminary marks would edit their movies
to earn an R rating. This year, he said, several directors refused
to recut their works. More X ratings resulted.
   The trade newspaper Daily Variety, in a column by Laurence Cohn,
defended the rating system, saying filmmakers should accept the
rating ``and run with it.''
   Two of the nation's largest movie exhibitors _ General Cinema
and National Amusements, representing a combined 2,250 screens
domestically _ generally do not show X-rated films.
   Many newspapers and most TV and radio stations do not accept ads
for most X-rated films.
   A movie bearing an X rating, then, has little chance of
recouping its costs, critics of the rating say.
   Shapiro-Glickenhaus is releasing its film ``Frankenhooker''
without a rating because the MPAA ratings board ruled it too harsh
for an R.
   ```Frankenhooker' is a much less explicitly gruesome film than
`Total Recall,' which got an R,'' said James Glickenhaus, president
of the independent film company.
   Many critics say the ratings are arbitrary and communicate
little about a film's true subject matter. Mace Neufeld, producer
of the upcoming release ``Flight of the Intruder,'' said if he uses
more than one ``f-word,'' his film will be rated R instead of the
desired PG-13.
   ``So I'm going through the film, trying to decide which of the
five f-words is the most important,'' Neufeld said. ``That's
absurd.''
   As defined by the MPAA, the G rating is for all ages; PG means
some material may not be suitable for children; PG-13 means some
material may be inappropriate for children under 13; R says patrons
under 17 require an accompanying parent or adult guardian; and X
means no one under 17 admitted (age limit may vary in certain
areas).

   Across the Mediterranean basin, a major summer
drought has killed dozens of people, destroyed crops, dried up
rivers, forced rationing and sparked water wars.
   French farmers are sabotaging water pumps that supply city
dwellers. A two-month heat wave left 38 people dead in Algeria.
Half of Italy's olive crop has been destroyed. Residents of
Istanbul, Turkey, are limited to four hours of water a day.
   In Greece, the drought is the worst in 100 years, forcing the
government to raise water prices 300 percent in an effort to drive
down consumption.
   Supertankers are shipping water to hard-hit Greek coastal areas
and geologists drilling for fresh supplies. Agricultural
cooperatives say farmers have sustained losses of $2 billion.
   The Greek government plans to divert the central Evinos river to
replenish reservoirs around Athens, where the current supply would
last only 98 days.
   Much of France is suffering a second year of drought. A heat
wave last weekend claimed five lives, including a farmer who
dropped dead while installing irrigation equipment.
   A persistent Atlantic high-pressure system has held rainfall in
Normandy and the entire southern third of the country to 50 percent
below average. Dozens of towns have banned lawn-watering and
car-washing.
   ``In the regions of France where it's dry, it's the driest for
10 years,'' meteorologist Guy La Riviere of the National Weather
Service said Friday.
   Officials in the southwestern Aude region, where rationing has
been in effect since 1989, reported anxious farmers were illegally
diverting water to save corn and sunflower crops.
   Farmers occasionally sabotage public water pumps they consider
to be stealing water from their sun-baked fields, officials say.
   ``The acts become more dramatic as the situation gets more
urgent,'' said Jean-Pierre Monod, president of a farming
cooperative.
   Lack of rain has left major rivers like the Loire, Rhone and
Garonne at half their normal levels. When temperatures in the
Garonne climbed to 82 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, the Goflech
nuclear power plant shut down because the river water was too hot
to cool the reactor.
   Across the Mediterranean in Algeria, a two-month heat wave has
been blamed for 38 deaths in the southern city of Ain Salah.
Temperatures consistently hovered at 104 degrees.
   In Algiers, residents stockpiled water and braced for a
government-ordered suspension of supplies Sunday and Monday. Water
reserves have dropped by two-thirds in the capital the past two
years.
   In Italy, rainfall so far this year has been nearly 40 percent
below average, said Lt. Col. Paolo Ernani of the Weather Bureau.
   More than half the olive harvest has been destroyed and the
drought will seriously affect production for next year's crop,
according the main consortium of Italian olive oil producers.
   The island of Sardinia has asked the government to declare a
state of emergency. The boot-heel region of Puglia has already
received such designation, along with $400,000 in aid.
   In Turkey, two years of drought have parched most coastal and
inland regions except along the Black Sea in the north, waterworks
and meteorology officials said.
   In some quarters of Istanbul, the only water available for
washing is in public baths, and drinking supplies are limited to
four hours per day.
   In Portugal, hot, dry conditions caused the number of forest
fires between June 15 and July 23 to increase by one-fourth over
the same period last year, said National Fire Service Chief
Cristiano Santos.
   Fires also destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest and
brush in eastern, southern and northwestern Spain, southern France,
and parts of Italy.
   One blaze on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius has raged since
Monday, and a wildfire burned out of control Friday on the Greek
island of Samos.

   In the coal-mining town of Nalaikh,
Lhagvadorj the driver was expressing doubt that preparations for
Sunday's elections were fair. Suddenly, an angry woman strode up
and began berating him.
   ``She says that we are agitating against the Communist Party,''
Lhagvadorj said after the woman fell into sullen silence. ``She is
a member.''
   Asked if he was afraid, the driver looked serious.
   ``She will certainly tell the officials about this,'' he said,
adding that it could get him in trouble.
   In Mongolia's capital of Ulan Bator, Communist Party leaders say
they want the country's first multiparty elections to be fair. They
say they are willing to share power with opposition parties
demanding human rights and a market economy, and express support
for those goals.
   But the scene in Nalaikh, just outside Ulan Bator, dramatized a
key obstacle _ local Communists unwilling to give up the absolute
power the party held for nearly seven decades.
   This spring, popular demonstrations in Ulan Bator inspired by
the anti-Communist revolution in Eastern Europe forced the
Communists _ formally known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party _ to overhaul their leadership, legalize opposition parties
and reduce controls on religion and the media.
   But Lhagvadorj and many opposition supporters said Friday the
Communists still controlled too many aspects of the election
process.
   The first round of balloting, held last Sunday, knocked out
about one-third of the fledgling opposition's candidates for the
430-seat legislature, the Great People's Hural.
   The final round of voting comes Sunday.
   Lhagvadorj, who like most Mongolians uses only one name, said
candidates were supposed to be nominated by the people this time.
But he said the first he heard of nominations was when officials
brought the final list around.
   Other Nalaikh residents nodded in agreement.
   ``The nominees are mostly the chiefs _ top officials, not from
among the workers,'' said Munhkjargal, a worker.
   ``But we cannot do anything,'' said a young man. ``We have to
give our vote to one of them.''
   With the opposition still in the running for only about 100
Great Hural's seats, the Communists are guaranteed victory. But the
Nalaikh voters' comments indicate that a Communist victory cannot
be interpreted as a rejection of reform.
   A better barometer may be the party popularity poll on Sunday's
ballot. Voters are to mark which party they support, in addition to
choosing a candidate who may or may not be from that party.
   The results will be used to allocate seats in the new Small
Hural, a 53-seat body that will meet in between the Great Hural's
annual sessions. It will draft and pass legislation, which the
Great Hural can overturn, and handle day-to-day matters.
   Opposition leaders say they believe they could capture a
majority in the Small Hural.
   All the parties seemed uncomfortable with the messiness of
pluralistic politics. There were few election posters and no
debates. Many candidates simply sponsored free concerts or movies
in their district to gain name recognition.
   Although all parties say they want greater personal freedoms,
rule of law, less central planning and other reforms, they differ
widely in the pace and boldness of such moves.

   Actress Kelly McGillis says she's
perfectly happy being married to someone outside show business.
   Her husband, Fred Tillman, is a Newport Beach yacht broker, and
the 32-year-old actress says she took it as a compliment when a
tabloid newspaper reported she had married a ``complete nobody.''
   ``I have lived with actors and dated actors and personally I
found it really boring,'' said Miss McGillis, who starred opposite
Tom Cruise in ``Top Gun.''
   ``All your life is talking about work or living it,'' she said
in an interview this week. ``I wanted something more than that. And
I obviously met the right person and it really didn't matter what
he did. I don't care. He's great.''
   She said her marriage on New Year's Eve, 1988, and the birth of
the couple's daughter, Kelsey Lauren, in May, has ``changed my
outlook.''
   ``Before, my work was my whole life, and getting married was one
step of claiming a personal life and certainly having a child is
claiming a much bigger chunk of personal life,'' she said. ``This
little person that looks at me and says, `Feed me,' that's really
important to me now.''

   Julie Harris, the actress who has won five
Tony Awards, is to star in a preview production of ``Lucifer's
Child'' next January at Duke University.
   ``To have such a highly respected actress as Julie Harris come
to Duke is exciting enough,'' said the university's drama director,
David Ball. ``But to have Julie Harris starring in a one-woman show
called `Lucifer's Child' is almost too good to be true.''
   ``Lucifer's Child,'' a new play Miss Harris commissioned from
playwright William Luce, looks at the life of Danish author Isak
Dinesen, pen name of the late Danish Baroness Karen Blixen-Finecke,
who wrote ``Out of Africa.''
   The play, which will be staged Jan. 25-Feb. 9, is set in
Rungstedlund, Denmark, some time after Dinesen's return from 17
years in Africa.
   Miss Harris is only the latest star who has been featured in
Duke's 11 Broadway preview performances. Others include Mikhail
Baryshnikov in ``Metamorphosis,'' Jack Lemmon in ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night,'' and the late Rex Harrison, who appeared at
Duke last fall in ``The Circle,'' the final production of his
career.

more than 600 songs include ``Thing Called Loved,'' a hit for
Bonnie Raitt, and ``Slow Turning.''
   ``I've learned to be able to write without all the planets being

back of the bus, in the laundry room, with the television blasting,
whatever the circumstances.
   In the past, Hiatt said many of his songs ``reflected the fact

the fact I want to spend more time with my family.''
   He and his wife have three children.

<HEAD>Senate-Passed Farm Bill Keeps Supports, Increases Environmental
Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farm bill that keeps major support programs
and increases environmental protection is the most progressive
agricultural law ever passed by the Senate, the Agriculture
Committee chairman says.
   The $54 billion measure, setting farm policy and spending for
the next five years, was approved Friday. The House version is
expected to pass next week, followed by a conference committee to
iron out any differences between the two versions.
   ``It's the most progressive farm bill I've seen come out of this
body,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who guided the bill to the
final 70-21 vote after taking a strong interest in seeing
environmental provisions strengthened.
   The bill establishes price-support programs for commodities and
sets policy for nutrition programs, agricultural exports, soil and
water conservation, agricultural research and extension work, food
inspection and other responsibilities of the Agriculture Department.
   Among the environmental breakthroughs in the bill is a ban on
the export of agricultural chemicals illegal in the United States.
   The bill also establishes standards for use of the phrase
``organically grown'' and lays down new policies designed to
protect wetlands and forests.
   Significant additions to the bill included sanctions against
Iraq and limits on loans that could be made to the Soviet Union.
   The House and Senate both voted Friday to use the farm bill
against Iraq by cutting off U.S. loan guarantees the country uses
to buy American wheat, rice, lumber, cattle and commercial goods
such as tires and machinery.
   The Senate voted to restrict loans to the Soviet Union by
preventing lending institutions from offering credit at a lower
rate to the Soviets than to farmers, unless the funds are used to
buy U.S. agricultural products.
   Among those voting against the Senate bill was Sen. Thomas
Daschle, D-S.D., a member of Leahy's committee, who said the price
support structure in the measure would drive many farmers in his
state out of business.
   Leahy and the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Richard Lugar
of Indiana, said budget negotiations would lead to cuts in farm
subsidy spending.
   Despite seven days of debate, which sometimes lasted late into
the night, the bill emerged from the Senate virtually the same as
when it went to the floor, said Leahy.
   The big expense in the bill is in price supports, which assure
farmers of a certain level of income even if market prices are low.
   The Bush administration was never happy with the amount the
Senate sought to spend on support programs and threatened a veto
before floor debate if the costs weren't brought down. Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter suggested that Congress wait until a
budget summit agreement was reached before acting on the bill.
   ``I have no intention of seeing the bill finished in conference
until there has been a summit agreement,'' Leahy said.
   Lugar said the bill was structured to allow for cutting what was
necessary without tearing apart major programs.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the bill followed the
philosophy of the law passed in 1985. But he added: ``The problem
with the 1985 farm bill was that it cost about $80 billion in
program outlays. We no longer have $80 billion to spend.''
   He said the spending projected by 1990 bill might have to be
pared back as much as $2.5 billion a year.
   Final Senate approval of the bill came after compromises and
speedy approval of dozens of amendments that had held up progress
for days.
   One of the stickiest disputes was between Great Lakes and Gulf
Coast senators about the amount of food aid to foreign countries
that should be shipped out of Great Lakes ports.
   Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John Breaux, D-La., agreed to a
formula that limits the Great Lakes to 240,000 tons of food aid
cargo annually and allows them to use less costly foreign ships
that fly an American flag and use American crews.

   A bailiff in a Canton court has been executed for
robbing farmers of gold and using counterfeit currency to buy gold,
a newspaper reported.
   Last June, Huang Xinkai asked two farmers from his hometown to
persuade five other peasants from the same village to come to the
southern port city of Canton to sell gold, the local Yangcheng
Evening News reported in its Thursday edition.
   When they arrived, Huang and three others, pretending to be
police and using Huang's club and handcuffs, robbed the farmers
from the neighboring Guangxi autonomous region of 15 ounces of gold.
   After making three gold rings for his accomplices, Huang sold
the rest of the gold for more than $400, the paper said.
   Huang was sentenced to death and was executed Thursday after his
appeal was turned down. Executions in China are administered by a
single bullet to the back of the head.

   The Soviet Union would like to restore diplomatic
ties with Albania, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   ``That is our position,'' ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said Friday. ``So it might be assumed that those
relations will be resumed.''
   The Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with Albania in
1961 as a result of a split with China, which then became Albania's
chief communist ally.
   Albania, the last hard-line communist state in Europe, also has
no relations with Washington or Moscow. It has said it will resist
the democratic reforms that have swept Eastern Europe.
   Earlier this month, more than 4,500 Albanian citizens demanding
change sought refuge in foreign embassies in the capital, Tirana,
and were allowed to leave the country.

   Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial will go
to the jury next week without jurors hearing the mayor defend
himself or face questions from prosecutors.
   After the defense closed its case Friday, prosecutors alleged in
rebuttal that a defense witness lied when giving testimony that
undermined a cocaine possession charge against Barry.
   Barry didn't testify, saying he wanted to avoid theatrics.
   ``It would have been good Perry Mason drama, L.A. Law drama, but
I'm not about Perry Mason drama,'' the District of Columbia mayor
said after the day's session.
   ``My spirits are high; my defense is on course.''
   In the rebuttal, the government introduced a document showing
that city employee Clifton Roberson wasn't even working at the time
he said he accepted a job application from an admitted drug dealer.
   The dealer, Lydia Pearson, had said she went to a city office on
Sept. 7, 1988, and handed a job application to the mayor, along
with crack cocaine.
   Roberson had testified it was he, not the mayor, who met with
Pearson that day. Roberson said he got the application from
Pearson, that Barry was nowhere in the vicinity and that there was
no crack.
   But Roberson was laying a gravestone for his father's grave at
the time he said he was taking the application, according to a
document prosecutors found in city files.
   The document notifies Roberson that he was absent without
official leave.
   Testifying Friday at Barry's trial, city worker Darcelle Walker
recalled that Roberson had been ``upset'' over the incident, for
which he was docked two hours' pay.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy suggested that Roberson was
absent in the late afternoon, rather than the morning when the job
application was turned in.
   Roberson is an assistant to longtime Barry aide Anita Bonds, who
has sat throughout the trial at the mayor's side, assisting his
defense.
   Outside the courtroom, Barry said he believed Roberson had been
at work when Pearson left the application.
   ``I know I didn't take it,'' Barry said of the job application.
After the defense rested its case Friday, Walker was one of four
rebuttal witnesses called by the government to attack Barry's
defense.
   As part of its rebuttal case, the prosecution also called Delois
Mise. She testified that she saw Barry bodyguard, police officer
James Stays, snort cocaine at a 1985 party. Stays had testified for
the defense that he never saw Barry use drugs on a March 1988 trip
to the Virgin Islands. Stays denied that he himself had used drugs
at the 1985 party. Mundy said he wants to recall Stays next week
before closing arguments.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
department planned an internal investigation of Stays as soon as
the trial is over.
   Barry is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession, three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy.
   The trial is expected to go to the jury by the middle of next
week.

   Forty-eight years after Doolittle's
Raiders first pierced the skies of Japan, the squadron's navigator
is joining the search for planes that crashed after the successful
bombing mission.
   Retired Col. Henry A. Potter said Friday he will join five
others in a search in Zhejiang Province, China, where Potter's and
four other B-25B bombers went down after the April 18, 1942,
mission. It was the first successful air raid against Japan during
World War II.
   The 16-plane squadron from the USS Hornet boosted the morale of
the American public following the December 1941 attack on Pearl
Harbor. The plane flown by Col. James H. Doolittle was the first
fully loaded bomber ever to take off from an aircraft carrier.
   The mission was so secret that even President Franklin Roosevelt
was not informed, said Potter, 71, of Austin, Texas.
   Doolittle trained the crews for the short takeoffs at a landing
strip in Florida. Potter was the navigator of Doolittle's lead
bomber.
   ``I don't think we exhibited any more courage than anyone
else,'' Potter said, recalling the 467-foot takeoff. ``I don't
think any of us thought about anything other than that we were
doing our jobs.''
   The skies cleared before the planes reached their targets, and
the bombs were dropped successfully on key industrial sites.
   The bombers tried to flee Japanese air space and land on
mainland China, but stormy weather made it impossible for them to
reach safe haven.
   One of the planes landed in Russia. The other 15 landed in the
water near the China coast or crashed after the crews bailed out,
according to an official War Department report of the mission.
   All 80 crew members made it to the ground safely, but eight were
captured by the Japanese. Of those, three were executed by their
captors, one died in prison and four were released when the war
ended, the government report says.
   Forty-four of the original Doolittle Raiders, including
Doolittle, are still alive and meet annually, Potter said.
Doolittle is 93 and lives in Carmel, Calif.
   Potter said there has been talk about searching for the planes
over the years, but said the expedition near the mountain villages
of Linan and Quzhou, in an area to the south of Shanghai, will be
the first.
   Bryan Moon, an artist and history buff, is leading the
expedition.
   ``This was one of the most important events in American aviation
history. It needs to have the i's dotted and the t's crossed,''
Moon said.
   Aside from Potter, none of the expedition members have links to
the bombing mission. The expedition will leave Minneapolis on Sept.
6, with a planned three-week stay in China.
   Moon, 62, a former Northwest Airlines vice president who lives
in Frontenac, Minn., has led expeditions around the world. In 1986,
he discovered the lost grave of Joy Adamson, the lion-lover of
``Born Free'' fame in Kenya. He served as an artist for the North
and South Pole expeditions of Ely, Minn.-based explorer Will Steger.
   The Doolittle expedition is being paid for by the participants.
It has the full cooperation of officials of the provincial
government, said Xiangling Zhao, the Chinese counsul.
   ``I am very happy that this group can go to China on this
historical mission,'' he told a news conference. ``I wish them good
luck.''
   The expedition also includes photographer Arthur Gibson, 64, of
Middlesex, England; Dr. George Weir, 58, a St. Paul
anesthesiologist; Joyce Olson, 44, of Wayzata, vice president of
The Hadley Companies, a fine arts publisher; and Olson's daughter
Heidi Olson, 28, of Stillwater, a personal fitness trainer.

   Some towns have begun rationing basic

   Bulgarians have faced growing shortages in recent months because
all exportable items are being sent abroad.
   Rationing has been introduced in the Black Sea port city of
Varna, as well as in the towns of Pleven, Blagoevgrad and other
cities, BTA said Friday. It did not say when the rationing went
into effect or how long it would be in force.
   It said there will be rationing next month in the country's
second-largest city, Plovdiv.
   According to the brief dispatch, the movement Women And Mothers
Against Violence had appealed to Parliament and the reformed
communist government to introduce temporary rationing because of
shortages of basic consumer goods.
   BTA said goods in short supply include sugar, oil, dairy
products, sausage and detergent.

   The contention by Mayor Marion Barry's
attorney that the FBI is targeting black officials for sting
operations is a new twist on the argument that black officeholders
get more than their fair share of law enforcement scrutiny.
   But the FBI on Friday continued to reject both arguments,
including the notion that it has an ``assault force'' roaming the
country trying to create evidence to prosecute black officials.
   ``There's no way you could hide something like that,'' FBI
spokesman Greg Jones said. ``There are people upstanding enough in
the FBI that it would get out. It's not like the old place.''
   Barry's attorney in his cocaine and perjury trial, R. Kenneth
Mundy, told the trial judge Thursday that the FBI had targeted
Andrew Young, Julian Bond and other black leaders in Chicago and
California for undercover sting operations.
   Mundy said out of the presence of the jury that FBI Agent Ronald
Stern, whose sting operation videotaped Barry smoking crack
cocaine, ``in effect moves around the country as the head of an ...
assault force of FBI agents.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin responded: ``There is
absolutely no truth to the allegation.''
   Said Jones: ``There is not a group that crisscrosses the country
targeting black officials.''
   The FBI has no numbers to show its investigations have been
balanced racially, because it doesn't keep such statistics, he said.
   ``There is no way the FBI could differentiate by race the number
of individuals we've investigated,'' Jones said. ``I think it would
be ludicrous to. I don't think the public would stand for it.''
   A congressional source said he has seen details from black
officials on the allegations, but he has never seen Stern's name
connected with any of them.
   In addition, he said, there had never been mention of any roving
task force and he added that such a force ``is not a concept that I
know of in the FBI.''
   One of the most prominent cases has been that of Birmingham,
Ala., Mayor Richard Arrington, a former college professor who says
he has been the subject of FBI scrutiny since the early 1970s and
was the target of several sting operations from 1987 through 1989.
   Arrington's attorney Donald V. Watkins, compiled a report
detailing operations against other black officials, and submitted
that report to the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility.
   The report includes details from affidavits submitted by Atlanta
attorney and former FBI undercover operative Hirsch Friedman. He
testified in 1987 that the FBI had a policy called Fruhmenschen _ a
German term for ``primitive man'' _ that selectively targeted
African-American elected and appointed officials for investigation,
according to the report.
   The Friedman affidavits said the policy was based on ``the
assumption by the FBI that black officials were intellectually and
socially incapable of governing major governmental operations and
institutions.''
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said the OPR, which
investigates allegations of wrongdoing by department officials,
``is reviewing the allegations that the mayor of Birmingham has
brought to us, but we cannot comment further.''
   Barry has said since long before he was arrested in January that
prosecutors unfairly singled him out for investigation because he
is a prominent black officeholder.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks recently echoed those
complaints, telling The Washington Post that prosecutors had spent
millions of dollars pursuing such black politicians as Barry while
ignoring ``those lying, conniving, thieving savings and loan
officials who robbed this country blind.''
   Attorney General Thornburgh angrily denied such suggestions,
saying, ``We are prosecuting people on the basis of whether or not
there is legally admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt their wrongdoing regardless of race, religion or color or
political affiliation.''

<HEAD>Angry Republicans Hit Democrats for Not Producing Budget Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Congressional Republicans are denouncing
Democrats for failing to offer a plan to cut next year's deficit,
and are badly split over a Bush administration proposal that
includes boosts in liquor taxes.
   Democrats said Friday they are in little hurry to make a
budget-cutting offer to Republicans. With a $54 billion White House
package of tax increases and spending cuts under fire, Republicans
complained that it is the Democrats' turn to ante up.
   ``This is when you finally get off your butt and do something,''
said the No. 2 Senate Republican, Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming.
   ``It's a shame people are trying to figure out how not to work
together,'' said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   Democrats met Friday and said they discussed plans to enact a
compromise budget pact with Republicans after Congress returns from
its month-long August recess. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1, and deep
cuts in federal spending will be triggered by the Gramm-Rudman law
unless the projected $169 billion deficit is cut sharply.
   ``It looks to me like it's doubtful the Democrats will produce a
package before September,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   GOP officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said it appeared that the administration plan included an increase
in the tax on hard liquor. The plan would boost the current $1.98
federal levy on a 750-milliliter bottle to $2.54.
   On Thursday, Republicans said the plan would increase the
federal tax on a six-pack of beer from 16 cents to 81 cents and
from 3 cents to 76 cents on a 750-milliliter bottle of wine.
   Another element of the White House plan would limit the amount
of state and local income taxes that can be deducted on federal tax
returns to $10,000, officials said. Almost everyone who would be
affected by that plan earns more than $100,000 annually.
   Both of these elements drew fire from some Republicans.
   ``A lot of members realize the regressivity of beer and wine
taxes,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the No. 3 House
Republican. ``You're talking about a big wallop to that
middle-income family.''
   The normally loyal Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said, ``No comment,''
when asked what he thought of the plan.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said of the proposal, ``You can agree
or disagree, and I do both.''
   Congressional leaders discussed their budget problems for the
fourth consecutive morning with President Bush at the White House.
Later, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said it appeared
likely that negotiators would meet at times over the congressional
recess.
   Besides higher alcohol taxes and limits on tax deductibility,
the White House also proposed freezing benefits for federal
civilian and military retirees for one year. The plan would save
the government $1.4 billion next year by eliminating, for one year,
the annual increase such pensioners receive to compensate for
inflation.
   On Thursday, No. 2 House Republican Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
distributed a letter to his colleagues saying any plan with
cost-of-living freezes ``will not have my support.'' Domenici
circulated a similar letter.
   Lewis said that further bad feelings arose because Republicans
met for 90 minutes Thursday with Sununu and White House budget
chief Richard Darman but were provided no details of what was in
the budget proposal.
   ``We're tired of them coming down to massage us, but not being
willing to be specific with us,'' said Lewis. ``It's created a rub
within the Republican conference that's not helpful in supporting
the administration's position.''
   The White House plan would also cut benefit programs by $16
billion, including $6 billion in Medicare cuts; cut defense by
about $7 billion, and slash domestic and foreign aid programs by $4
billion.
   The White House package also contains many elements of the
budget Bush proposed in January. These include a cut in the capital
gains tax rate, which the president says would encourage sales of
property and thereby add to federal revenues. It would also boost
various federal fees by $5.6 billion.

<HEAD>Labor Union, Corporations Could Lose Political Action Committees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The political arms of labor unions,
corporations and trade associations could be the big losers in
Senate efforts to clean up the way politicians raise money for
elections.
   Senate Democrats on Friday joined Republicans in calling for a
total abolition of the special interest political action committees
responsible for raising $45 million of the $180 million spent on
Senate campaigns in the 1988 elections.
   With the Senate scheduled to vote next week on campaign finance
reform legislation, the move by Democratic leaders effectively
denied Republicans a chance to force a vote on PACs and portray
Democrats as opponents of reform.
   For months, Republicans have been calling for abolition of the
committees, which have tended to bestow an overwhelming majority of
their largesse in recent campaigns on incumbent congressional
Democrats.
   Also deleted from the Democratic reform package Friday was a
plan opposed by virtually all Republicans and many Democrats for
the government to pay 70 percent of a candidate's general election
campaign costs through a voluntary taxpayer checkoff.
   ``They kept talking about PACs and public financing,'' Boren
said of Republicans. ``We hope they will reciprocate by taking in
spending limits.''
   The Democratic moves were the latest in a flurry of efforts by
each party to portray itself as the conciliating agent of reform
and the opposing party as the obstacle to it before the Senate
begins debating the issue Monday.
   Republican leaders on Thursday for the first time offered to
accept at least a notion of an aggregate ceiling on how much a
candidate can raise, but only for out-of-state contributions in
excess of $250 each.
   Senate candidates under the GOP proposal could still raise
unlimited funds from in-state voters and through direct-mail
campaigns to out-of-state donors of less than $250.
   The GOP, which a much more advanced computerized direct-mail
apparatus than Democrats, contend a ceiling on total spending would
prevent challengers from buying the TV ads most of them need to
match an incumbent's name recognition.
   Because of constitutional concerns that an outright ban on PACs
might be ruled a violation of First Amendment rights of free
speech, both parties have a fallback position to reduce how much
each PAC could contribute to a single candidate.
   The current maximum allowable contribution a candidate can
receive from any one PAC is $5,000 each for primary, runoff and
general elections. The fallback provision would cut that amount to
$1,000.
   Boren and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
Democrats remain united on insisting that any bill have an absolute
ceiling on total aggregate spending.
   Their proposal currently calls for ceilings of $1 million to
$5.5 million for each of the primary, runoff and general elections,
based on the size of each state's voting age population. Democrats,
however, have said they are willing to raise the lids if it would
pick up Republican votes.
   House Democratic leaders, meanwhile, were still undecided on
whether to bring up rival campaign finance measures for a vote next
week before recessing for an August vacation.
   Two Democratic bills would place a spending ceiling of $550,000
on House races. One would limit PAC contributions to half that
amount, or $275,000, with no public financing. The other would
limit PACs to $240,000 with $100,000 of public financing.
   Like their Senate counterparts, House Republicans are opposing
any campaign ceilings. They also would limit individual PAC
contributions to a candidate to $1,000 for each election.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem militants said they
captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in the Parliament
building on Friday in this Caribbean capital. There were reports of
gunfire and explosions in the city.
   Abu Bakr, head of the black rebel group, said in a nationwide
radio and TV broadcast late Friday that the government was toppled.
The claim could not be independently confirmed.
   Earlier, Bakr had a station newscaster read a statement on
national television about 6 p.m. EDT in which Bakr announced the
uprising by the group Jamaat al-Muslimeen, which is Arabic for the
Group of Moslems. He claimed to be holding captive in Parliament
the prime minister, Arthur Robinson.
   An announcer on Radio 610, Dennis McComie, quoted Bakr as having
said on TV that ``the government has been overthrown'' and promised
elections within 90 days. Bakr did not mention what he had done
with the prime minister and his Cabinet.
   Bakr was quoted as saying his motive for moving against the
government was ``poverty and the destruction of Trinidad. ... We
will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no hope
for the present regime to stop.''
   There has been no official reaction from the government but late
Friday in Washington, State Department spokesman Dave Denny said,
``We would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic
government of Trinidad.''
   He also said, ``Our embassy reports gunfire in the vicinity of
the TV station. Explosions and gunfire have been heard downtown.''
   There were unconfirmed reports of casulaties in this city of
300,000 residents though Denny said he had no word about the
situation of Americans in Trinidad. Trinidad's smaller island of
Tobago is a popular vacation site.
   Bakr said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians, McComie told The Associated Press.
   The Moslem group claims to have 200 to 250 members. They are
known as a small militant group with connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding.
   The rebel statement said the Cabinet also was being held hostage
with Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist, but it could not be ascertained how many were inside the
Parliament building.
   Trinidad's ambassador to the United States told CBS Radio in
Washington that Robinson and the entire Cabinet, which had been
meeting at the time, were believed in the custody of the rebels.
   A radio station in Trinidad, government-owned National
Broadcasting Service, said that police headquarters in downtown
Port-of-Spain also had been blown up Friday by the rebels. The
rebels are based in St. James, outside the capital, and near police
headquarters.
   McComie said the central police station was on fire and there
had been several explosions that he assumed was ammunition. No one
was trying to put the fire out and it was spreading to surrounding
structures, he said, adding that it appeared headed for the
telephone company.
   Trinidadian James Fadelle of Miami said he had spoken with a
friend in Port-of-Spain by telephone earlier Friday evening.
   ``They're all locked up in their houses. They cannot go
outside,'' Fadelle said. He added that his friend, Peter Lambie,
had told him some civilians had been killed in the downtown area
and two police stations had been blown up.
   McComie said he was in the street by the radio station at 6 p.m.
when he heard gunshots inside Red House, which is the parliament
building. He said he returned safely to the station, but two gunmen
entered and set fire to the engineering department.
   McComie said radio employees were able to extinguish the fire.
   ``We can see people in the streets with guns,'' he said.
   The leader, Bakr, is a former police officer in Trinidad. Little
is known about him. Trinidad published reports say he spent some
time in Libya.
   Trinidad, the larger of the two islands in the nation of
Trinidad and Tobago, has a population of about 1.3 million, and is
just off the northeast coast of Venezuela. Trinidad and Tobago
gained independence from Britain in 1962. It is an English-speaking
country with a large populace from India.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindus. Only about 6 percent are Moslem.
   The island in recent years has suffered from a recession, with
closing of oil refineries, devaluation of the local currency and a
new, unpopular 15 percent value-added tax, according to locals.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain, creating controversy and
tensions on the island.
   The 1,500-member army has not entered into the fray yet, and is
said to be in northwestern Trinidad.
   The broadcast statement said the rebels were in touch with the
army but it was not known what that signified.
   The police force on Trinidad has about 5,000 members.
   McComie said he and his crew had locked themselves inside the
building and considered themselves ``in considerable danger.''
   Although station personnel felt in danger, they continued to
broadcast a live broadcast of a soccer game at the national stadium
in Port-of-Spain.
   A security guard at the Trinidad Guardian said the newspaper
building had been evacuated. He said that most likely there would
not be a Saturday edition.

   The farm bill approved by the Senate carries
an estimated five-year cost of $54 billion and sets policy for
almost every program directed by the Agriculture Department. Here,
at a glance, are the major provisions of the legislation.
   The bill:
   _Freezes target prices at $4 a bushel for wheat; $2.75 a bushel
for corn, $2.61 for sorghum; $2.36 for barley; 73 cents a pound for
cotton and $10.71 per hundred pounds for rice.
   Oats would be set at $1.55 for 1991, with an increase each year
of 10 cents up to a maximum of $1.85.
   _Freezes milk prices at $10.10 per hundred pounds.
   _Continues the sugar price support at 18 cents a pound.
   _Establishes a loan rate for soybeans of $5.50 a bushel, but
gives the agriculture secretary the option of reducing it to $5 if
surpluses rise to a certain level. It also establishes a loan rate
of 9.7 cents for sunflower seed, canola, flax and safflower.
   _Establishes new grain quality standards.
   _Limits payments to wool and mohair producers to $250,000 a year.
   _Phases out the government's support program for honey producers.
   _Reorganizes the crop insurance program.
   _Prohibits export of pesticides banned from U.S. farm use.
   _Requires farmers to keep records of pesticides they use.
   _Authorizes $250 million to be spent over five years to help
farmers learn how to use fewer chemicals.
   _Sets the first national standard for use of the ``organically
grown'' label on food.
   _Protects about 80 million acres of fragile wetlands from
destruction by farming and allows farmers to restore some wetlands
by selling the federal government a conservation easement.
   _Sets up the first public-private partnership to protect 25
million acres of private forests and aims at protecting another 482
million acres of private forests through conservation easements and
other incentives.
   _Creates rural development programs designed to stimulate the
economies of small towns where consolidation of farms is causing
loss of agriculture-related jobs.
   _Calls for 20 percent of the money used for agricultural
research by 1993 to go toward finding industrial or other non-food
uses for farm products.
   _Gives the president greater authority to donate food, and spend
up to $50 million for agricultural necessities such as fertilizers
and transportation, to countries whose policies he wants to
influence.

   For Raymond Buckey, a jury deadlock marked
the end of a seven-year ordeal _ five years of which he spent in
jail convicted of nothing, but charged with the unspeakable crime
of child molestation.
   ``I've gone from probably one of the most hated people you could
ever mention to a point of where everybody that comes up to me now
is very sympathetic, and they're saying `I always thought you were
innocent,''' Buckey said after a mistrial was declared Friday.
   Buckey was retried on charges he molested children at the
McMartin Pre-School. Prosecutors said they wouldn't try him a third
time, bringing to a close the longest criminal case in U.S. history.
   ``I don't know if anyone can understand the feeling of waiting
seven years for someone to decide your fate,'' Buckey said.
   During his first trial, Buckey was charged with dozens of
molestation counts and acquitted of 40.
   Eight charges were refiled against him. In votes taken during 15
days of deliberation, jurors leaned toward acquittal on seven of
the eight counts. The eighth was split, 6-6. On Friday, they said
unanimous verdicts were impossible.
   The tall, square-jawed Buckey said the years in jail were tough
_ ``it's like a war zone in there.''
   But he acknowledged that the ordeal ``made me a very strong
person.''
   Buckey displayed some bitterness as he spoke of the cost exacted
by his family _ the loss of their home, their once prestigious
school in Manhattan Beach and the damage to their reputations. He
blamed those who would not let the case go away and those who
``played a political game with my life.''
   ``It was Salem revisited,'' he said. ``It was McCarthyism one
more time.''
   Buckey, who began the case as a gawky, self-conscious
25-year-old, seemed to grow in stature as the case progressed. He
is now 32, and appears confident, articulate and well-groomed.
   Once he left his glib attorney, Danny Davis, to talk to
reporters. Toward the end, he faced the TV cameras himself with
direct, thoughtful answers that made him his own best spokesman.
   He took the witness stand, sunburned from his return to the
seaside he loved, and told jurors he never molested any children.
   ``I'm innocent,'' he said after the jury had deadlocked. ``There
was the presumption of innocence at the start of this. ... I was
innocent coming in and I'm still innocent because I wasn't found
guilty.''
   Buckey said he hoped society would gain from his case but also
predicted the public would forget it in time.
   ``They'll remember the McMartin phenomenon,'' he said. ``But
given time something else will come along (to make headlines) and
I'll be anonymous and that's what I want.''
   Asked what he would do with the rest of his life, Buckey said,
``I would like to be just left alone. I'd like to move out of the
city and find a little fresh air. This is not the kind of life I
would have planned out.''
   He added with a smile, ``I'll have to get a job now.''

   Improper use of pesticides has killed more than
100 Chinese farmers and sickened 2,000 others in the coastal
province of Jiangsu this summer, according to news reports.
   Because of hot and humid conditions in the region, peasants use
large quantities of pesticides and often do not observe safety
procedures, the official People's Daily said Friday.
   The report said that more than 100 people had died because there
was no effective antidote for the pesticide poisoning. It called
for better management to prevent more deaths but did not provide

   Doctors believe the leukemia that has
hospitalized Czechoslovakia's ambassador might have been caused by
radioactive fallout from the 1986 Soviet nuclear accident at
Chernobyl, a Czech embassy official says.
   Ambassador Rita Klimova, 59, is in Johns Hopkins Hospital in
nearby Baltimore, where she faces perhaps four weeks of
chemotherapy treatment, the Czechoslovak Embassy said Friday.
   The ambassador's son, Vladimir Mlynar, visiting her from Prague,
said his mother ``feels quite good,'' and said she is ``slightly
optimistic,'' according to Embassy official Laco Mravec.
   Mrs. Klimova's leukemia, cancer of the white blood cells, was
diagnosed earlier this month at Walter Reed U.S. Army Medical
Center in Washington, where President Bush's physician arranged for
her to be examined, said Miroslav Chrobok, embassy charge
d'affaires.
   ``Two doctors at Walter Reed suggested it might be one of those
funny cases of leukemia we have in Eastern Europe ... it might be a
Chernobyl thing,'' Chrobok said.
   He said the Army doctors told him they meant cases of the
sometimes-fatal blood disease that have appeared with no apparent
cause of leukemia except exposure to air or water contaminated by
radiation over a wide region of Europe and Scandinavia after the
April 1986 nuclear power plant explosion at the Ukrainian city of
Chernobyl.
   ``Certainly there is nothing certain'' about the cause, ``it's
just a possibility,'' Chrobok said.
   At least 31 people perished during and after the Chernobyl
explosion and thousands were evacuated from the area of heaviest
contamination. Since then, numerous cases of blood-related
illnesses around Europe have been attributed to Chernobyl and
officials are urging a wider evacuation.
   Dr. Robert Gale, the Los Angeles physician who treated some of
Chernobyl's worst radiation cases, has said Chernobyl fallout could
increase cancer deaths by as many as 30,000 worldwide in the next
half century. Chrobok said Gale is among numerous well-wishers who
have messaged the ambassador, and has offered to assist on her case.
   Dr. Klimova, a newcomer to diplomacy, arrived in Washington last
February as her country's first new envoy to the United States
after the peaceful revolution that ended 40 years of Communist rule
last December.

   Nine Albanians illegally crossed
into Yugoslavia in the past two days, bringing the total to 47 so
far this month, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
   Police in Montenegro, the southern Yugoslav republic that
borders Albania, said the average age of the refugees is 23, Tanjug
reported Friday.
   Most of the Albanians have said they were fleeing harsh living
conditions and the policies of their government, the last hard-line
Stalinist country in Eastern Europe.
   This year, 89 Albanians have fled to Yugoslavia, 10 times the
number for all of last year.
   Albania announced a series of reforms in May and said border
guards would no longer shoot to kill if they spotted fleeing
Albanians.
   Tanjug said all Albanian refugees receive 30-day jail terms for
illegal entry into the country.
   They are then usually handed over to the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees in Belgrade, which arranges for their
resettlement in another country.
   About 4,500 people who packed foreign embassies in the Albanian
capital of Tirana were allowed to leave the country this month.

<HEAD>Pentagon Would Use Northrop Despite Justice Department's
Recommendation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's chief procurement official says
he would not prohibit Northrop Corp. from building weapons for the
military despite the Justice Department's belief that the company
should be barred.
   ``I'm not anticipating any debarment procedure,'' John Betti,
undersecretary of defense for acquisitions, told reporters during a
break in a six-hour hearing by a House Energy and Commerce panel on
charges of fraud and mismanagement at Northrop.
   Justice Department officials described how Northrop falsified
reports on the air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper
tests on the Harrier AV-8B jet.
   The company's action led to its guilty plea in February on 34
charges of fraud and a fine of $17 million, the largest criminal
fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   The last witness before the panel, a former Northrop employee
who has filed a false claims lawsuit against the company, charged
that the Air Force adjusted the budget targets on the B-2 bomber
when it realized the program was financially out of control.
   ``We paid Northrop $26 billion to build a new type of paper
airplane that carried this nation's debts to new heights,''
Jean-Francois Truong, who worked as one of eight financial
comptrollers for the 14,000-man B-2 work force in Pico Rivera,
Calif., and blew the whistle on Northrop, told the panel.
   Northrop is still the target of federal grand jury criminal
investigations, and Justice Department officials were reticent
about discussing specifics.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Would Ban Radar Detectors on Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has
approved a $29 billion transportation spending bill that would ban
radar detectors for trucks and require state courts to suspend the
driver's licenses of drug offenders.
   The bill also includes $125 million to speed passenger rail
service between New York and Boston by electrifying rail lines
between Boston and New Haven, Conn.
   Except for increased Amtrak funding and the radar-detector
provision, the bill allocates funds in roughly the same manner as
the House-passed appropriations bill. The House bill also includes
an amendment to require states to suspend the licenses of drug
offenders or suffer cuts in federal transportation dollars.
   The bill covers transportation spending for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The Senate bill sets aside $13.85 billion for highway
construction, maintenance and repairs; $8 billion for aviation,
including operations at the Federal Aviation Administration; $785
million for Amtrak; and $3.3 billion for mass transit.
   Committee Chairman Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said
electrifying the New England line will encourage more rail travel
between New York and Boston, decreasing the burden on airports.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Approves Military Support Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Armed Services subcommittee is paring
more than $5 billion from the Pentagon's budget by continuing a
hiring freeze for civilians and slashing maintenance funds for
overseas bases, congressional sources say.
   The panel on readiness cut force structure support costs by $5.9
billion from President Bush's original proposal of $79.3 billion to
meet levels set under a House budget resolution approved on May 1.
   Friday's action came in advance of Tuesday's session of the full
House Armed Services Committee, which is expected to craft a 1991
military budget of $283 billion _ $24 billion less than President
Bush sought in January.
   The lawmakers approved a $1.09 billion reduction in pay for the
Pentagon's civilian work force, which currently numbers around 1
million people.
   They also approved continuing the hiring freeze that was
introduced earlier this year by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ``as
a means of reducing the civilian work force,'' said the
congressional source, who spoke on condition of not being
identified by name.
   This would mean 60,000 to 65,000 fewer jobs for the civilians
who work for the military during the next fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1, the source said.

<HEAD>Government Rewrites Economic History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has rewritten a slice of
economic history, reporting that the total economy grew at a slower
pace last year than previously thought.
   The Commerce Department said Friday the gross national product _
the nation's broadest measure of economic health _ grew by 2.5
percent in 1989, instead of the 3 percent growth rate estimated
earlier.
   That put growth at its slowest pace since the recession year of
1982, when the GNP actually shrank by 2.5 percent.
   Government statisticians blamed the error on mistakes made in
estimating wages and salaries, which were overstated by $57.9
billion for 1989.
   The correction changed not only the government's economic
estimates but also its forecast for tax revenues over the next
several years. The Office of Management and Budget was forced to
slash its estimate for tax revenues by $195.5 billion over the next
five years.
   The drop in expected tax revenues along with the weaker economic
growth were two major factors forcing President Bush to reverse his
stand on taxes as part of negotiations with Congress to come up
with an acceptable deficit reduction plan.
   While the Commerce Department's initial assessment of wages is
based on a partial sample of businesses, the July update takes into
account more complete data gathered from the country's roughly 6
million businesses.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Removing Social Security Surplus From Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Department of Health and Human Services
advisory panel recommended removing Social Security from the
calculation of deficit reduction targets to focus public attention
on the ballooning deficit.
   The Advisory Council on Social Security also recommended Friday
continuing the payroll tax rate at the current level to build
reserves as a cushion for the retirement of 75 million baby
boomers, which will begin around 2010.
   The council said in its interim report that maintaining a strong
Social Security system depends on having a healthy, growing economy
and that large deficits in the federal budget weaken the economy.
   ``The Council believes that the growing Social Security reserves
should not routinely be used simply to offset large operating
deficits in the rest of the federal budget,'' the panel said.
   The panel's report said the financial soundness of the Social
Security trust funds is not affected by whether the trust funds are
included or excluded in calculating deficit reduction targets.
   But ``taking Social Security out of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
calculations will help federal policy-makers and the American
people focus on the fundamental importance of reducing the deficit
and moving toward a surplus in the overall federal budget,'' the
council said.
   The council also opposed changing the Social Security program's
financing to a ``pay-as-you-go'' system, in which payroll taxes
would be set at a rate sufficient to raise enough revenues to cover
current expenses and maintain a contingency reserve.

<HEAD>Gun Owners Sue Florio Over Assault Weapon Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELE DIGIROLAMO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gun enthusiasts made good on their threat
to take Gov. Jim Florio to court over his statewide ban on
military-style assault weapons.
   The National Rifle Association, the Coalition of New Jersey
Sportsmen and the Congress of Racial Equality filed a federal
lawsuit Friday seeking a temporary restraining order against the
law signed by Florio in May.
   The law bans the sale and severely curtails the possession of a
wide range of semiautomatic weapons in New Jersey.
   California is the only other state to ban assault weapons.
Supporters of the New Jersey bill call the New Jersey ban tougher
because it does not exempt current owners of the weapons.
   The groups hope to obtain a court hearing date next week, said
Ira Mallowe, treasurer of the Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen.
   The lawsuit takes aim at two provisions in the law _ one
restricting possession of certain gun magazines, the part of the
gun where ammunition is stored, and the other banning air guns and
BB guns.
   ``The law specifically prohibits individuals from possessing
magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds of ammunition, but
it also prohibits disposing of those magazines,'' said Richard
Manning, the NRA's New Jersey liaison.
   Mallowe said gun owners ``were made instant felons with no way
to cure the problem.''
   The lawsuit also said the state ban pre-empted federal law,
which allows ownership of air guns and BB guns.
   Under the law, current gun owners have one year either to sell
their guns out-of-state or turn them over to police. Collectors can
keep their weapons if the guns are rendered inoperable by the
removal of firing pins or bolts.
   Gun owners can also register their guns if they join a target
shooting club within seven months, but only if the guns are models
sanctioned for use in U.S. Army shooting competitions.
   Those arrested for illegal possession of the firearms face three
to five years in prison and a fine of up to $7,500. Using an
assault weapon in a crime can bring up to 20 years.

<HEAD>High-Tax States Decry Plan to Limit Deductions on Local Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's plan to raise
money by limiting deductions on local taxes could cripple the
ability of high-tax states to run schools and provide services,
opponents say.
   Taxpayers would be limited to a $10,000 deduction for state and
local income taxes under the plan, which is supported by Republican
congressional leaders.
   State officials feared the plan also might drive residents from
high-tax states to ones where income taxes are lower or
non-existent.
   ``If the state loses its income tax, which it relies on, then
you have to use the other taxes,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said Friday.
``Or would you stop feeding the poor people?'' Cuomo, a Democrat,
was a key player in the successful 1985 fight to save deductibility.
   ``I don't think it helps the states at a time when the federal
government is bailing out of responsibilities,'' said New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio.
   Cuomo and other officials say a loss of deductibility would put
pressure on them to reduce state and local income taxes at a time
when they are already hurting for tax revenue.
   A loss of deductibility would magnify every state and local
income tax increase for upper-income taxpayers because they would
lose the ability to deduct those taxes on their federal returns.
That, say critics of the plan, amounts to double taxation.
   Edward Farrell, executive director of the New York State
Conference of Mayors, said the practical effect would be states and
localities turning to more regressive taxes, such as sales or
property taxes.
   But those taxes are harder to increase, largely because of the
potential for taxpayer revolts. That means towns and cities might
be forced to sacrifice police, firefighters or other services, he
said.
   Poor school districts in New York, which rely heavily on state
income tax revenue, would ``find it impossible to maintain their
education,'' predicted Board of Regents Chancellor Martin Barell.
   Restrictions also could encourage residents of high-tax states
to move, thus decreasing the tax base, said Chris Zimmerman, chief
economist at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   ``A rich person in New York would get hit, but a rich person in
Texas wouldn't,'' he said. ``People don't migrate to Canada or
Mexico because the tax rate went up, but they might go to
Connecticut.''
   Connecticut has no income tax and Texas has no state income tax,
but some local income tax.

<HEAD>Land-Hungry Peasants Take Over Sandinista Cooperatives in
Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA CONCEPCION, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The peasants came out slowly
from behind the cement-block barricade, making sure the approaching
strangers weren't Sandinistas trying to force them off the
collective farm they took over.
   ``They were shooting automatic weapons into the air all night
long. We couldn't sleep,'' said Edwin Velazquez, apologizing for
the cool greeting.
   The anti-Sandinista peasants in La Concepcion and other areas of
Nicaragua share similar complaints about the conservative
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, which replaced
the leftist Sandinistas in April.
   The peasants say the new government has not responded quickly
enough to demands for land distribution, and that it is afraid to
press ahead decisively with handing out state-owned lands because
of a possible violent Sandinista reaction.
   But this year's planting season is halfway over, and some
peasants have taken matters into their own hands.
   On July 13, Velazquez and two dozen peasants armed with machetes
walked onto the 62-acre Sandinista collective farm and took it over.
   They didn't meet much resistance. The farmers of the Gaspar
Garcia Laviana collective live in another area, and only the
caretaker was present.
   A week later, a second group of peasants took over another
Sandinista cooperative near La Concepcion. A third cooperative,
farther away, had been taken over in early July.
   The peasants' impatience is shared by large landowners, such as
Ramiro Gurdian, president of the Nicaraguan Union of Agricultural
and Cattle Producers.
   Many feel the Sandinistas, although voted out of office in
February, still call the shots.
   Gurdian said a perception that Mrs. Chamorro's government is not
firm enough has scared away investment, especially in agriculture.
   A cotton grower, Gurdian said that only half of 250,000 acres
destined for cotton this year will be planted with the export crop.
   ``We're going to lose $30 million (in export earnings) we had
been counting on, and that's just in cotton,'' Gurdian said.
   The government is trying to change its image as timid and
fearful of crossing the Sandinistas.
   Minister of the Presidency Antonio Lacayo, son-in-law of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, recently went on television
to touch on comments heard often lately.
   Lacayo, considered the real power behind his mother-in-law's
presidency, denied there was a ``secret pact'' with the Sandinistas
and defended the government's cautious attitude.
   ``This is very difficult because this is a very polarized
society,'' he said, adding that the government's policy ``is simply
to impose dialogue to resolve any crisis.''
   Agrarian Reform Minister Gustavo Tablada said there has not been
enough time in the three months since the new government took over
to resolve the disposition of the 3,500 cooperatives nationwide.
   He said he failed to understand the land takeovers in La
Concepcion.
   ``The thing here is to have a lot of patience so as not to make
mistakes that later will have negative effects. ... We have to use
persuasion,'' Tablada said.
   Velazquez, however, is not waiting for the government to act.
   With the other men looking on and nodding, Velazquez said most
of the peasants occupying the farm do not have enough land. He said
the Sandinistas had abandoned the cooperatives and own additional
land elsewhere, while he and his neighbors had been forced to plow
plots too small for survival.
   Velazquez said his group had filed written requests for land
with the Agrarian Reform offices in the cities of Masaya and
Granada, at least two hours' drive away.
   ``We have never gotten a reply. That's when we decided to do
this,'' he said. ``Maybe these actions are illegal, but through
pressure we can achieve something.''
   The peasants have gone one step further. They have sent word to
the Sandinista farmers to have a parley and settle the dispute.
   ``They have land and we don't,'' Velazquez said. ``They are
peasants and so are we. The government hasn't even sent anybody
down to talk to us. I think we can reach an agreement, among us.
All we want to do is work.''

   The longest and costliest criminal case in
U.S. history ended when jurors deadlocked in Raymond Buckey's
retrial on charges he molested three girls at McMartin Pre-School.
   The judge declared a mistrial, and prosecutors said they would
not try Buckey a third time, closing a case that began seven years
ago. Amid initial allegations involving more than 100 children and
suggestions of satanism and animal torture, the case prompted
national concern over molestation.
   ``I think there is reason to say `enough' at this point,''
District Attorney Ira Reiner said after Superior Court Judge
Stanley Weisberg declared a mistrial Friday.
   ``There has been a mighty effort and there is no verdict,''
Reiner said.
   The judge set a hearing for Wednesday to dismiss charges against
Buckey, 32, who spent five years in jail. The case cost Los Angeles
County more than $13.5 million.
   ``We gave it our best shot,'' said the trial prosecutor, Deputy
District Attorney Joseph Martinez.
   ``These kids cannot be McMartin kids for the rest of their
lives. It's been a horrible experience,'' Martinez said.
   Buckey said he believed it had been a witch hunt from the
outset: ``It was Salem revisited,'' he said. ``It was McCarthyism
one more time.
   ``I've gone from probably one of the most hated people you could
ever mention,'' he said, ``to a point of where, everybody that
comes up to me now is very sympathetic, and they're saying `I
always thought you were innocent.'''
   The saga began in August 1983 when a mother reported to police
that her young son had been molested at the prestigious Manhattan
Beach preschool.
   Hysteria followed after police asked parents to check their
children for signs of molestation. Hundreds of parents reported
their children were victims and tots were rushed to therapy center
for interviews. Therapists decided more than 100 probably had been
molested.
   Children gave investigators accounts of ``naked games,'' satanic
rites and animals tortured to frighten the youngsters into silence.
   Seven defendants were arrested and charged with molestation:
Buckey, the only male, his mother, sister and aged grandmother,
along with three other women teachers.
   Reiner dismissed charges against all defendants except Buckey
and his 63-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, for lack of
evidence after an 18-month preliminary hearing. The Buckeys were
accused of molesting 11 children during a five-year period.
   After a trial lasting nearly three years, a jury in January
cleared Mrs. Buckey of 12 charges and absolved her son of 40
charges but deadlocked on 13 counts against him. Reiner decided to
retry Buckey on eight counts involving three girls.
   Jurors who spent three months hearing evidence in the retrial
and three weeks deliberating said they believed no jury would ever
agree on Buckey's guilt or innocence.
   The girls, now adolescents, testified about dim recollections of
events alleged to have happened as long as 10 years ago when they
were toddlers.
   The panelists divided their votes differently on the eight
counts, seven times leaning toward acquittal. The splits ranged
from 6-6 to 11-1.
   ``I don't think that you can get 12 people to reach a verdict in
this case,'' said juror Lloyd Isaacson.
   Several jurors said the prosecution's least effective evidence
was a series of videotapes made by Childrens Institute
International, in which therapists interviewed toddlers about
whether they were molested.
   Isaacson said he believed the children made claims they were
molested only after being told that their friends had revealed
``yucky secrets'' and were urged by therapists to do the same.
   ``I feel a child is just going to go along with the adult to say
what they want them to say,'' he said.
   Reiner said because parents wanted to resolve the case he did
not regret retrying Buckey.
   Defense lawyer Danny Davis, asked if the parents would ever
accept Buckey's innocence, said: ``I don't think they can.''
   Buckey said he wouldn't start making plans for the future until
charges are officially dismissed. But he said with a smile, ``I'll
have to get a job now.''

<HEAD>Crude, Gasoline Prices Seen Rising After OPEC Show Of Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil analysts predict crude prices and the cost of
gasoline will rise later this year as a result of the OPEC
agreement to curb output.
   Price-depressing overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates is less likely after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
intimidation campaign aimed at making the countries honor their
OPEC-set output quotas, analysts said.
   Under the agreement reached Friday by the 13 ministers of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, gasoline prices are
expected to rise up to 10 cents a gallon by December.
   The OPEC members agreed on a new overall production cap of 22.5
million barrels a day through the rest of the year. The figure is
400,000 barrels above the previous ceiling but will require OPEC to
cut its actual production, currently estimated at 23 million
barrels a day or more.
   The ministers also agreed at their two-day meeting to raise
their minimum target price, to $21 a barrel from $18, for a basket
of crudes monitored by OPEC. Because of an oil glut, the actual
price recently has been about $16.25 per barrel.
   ``These agreements are a display of the complete unity of OPEC,
which are unprecedented in the recent history of the
organization,'' said Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   Prices of energy futures settled slightly lower after initially
rising on news of the OPEC pact. Some traders blamed technical
factors and profit-taking from a price increase in anticipation of
the OPEC meeting.
   If members don't cheat on their allocated quotas, analysts said,
OPEC could reach its price by the end of the year, when the
northern hemisphere winter will push up oil demand.
   Nauman Barakat, an energy specialist at Shearson Lehman Hutton
in New York, predicted the accord's bite will be felt in the fall.
   ``It won't do anything for the market in August and September.
But I think in the fourth quarter, if demand is 24.4 (million
barrels a day for OPEC oil) as the cartel is saying and they're
going to be producing at 22.5, they'll be drawing nearly 2 million
barrels out of the market.''
   ``That could make the fourth quarter, especially the tail end of
the year, very strong.''
   At the gasoline pump, he predicted an increase of ``at least 6
cents or even more _ say a dime _ by the end of the year.''
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at the New York investment
firm Morgan Stanley, said OPEC could get close to its target price,
``assuming they stick closely to their quota levels.''
   He said this could add about 5 cents a gallon to gasoline prices
by December.
   Michael S. Rothman, energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, said Friday's accord sent an unexpectedly strong signal.
   ``The agreement is more bullish than what we've been looking
for,'' he said.
   OPEC had not changed its benchmark price since December 1986.
The increase signaled the once-dominant group's resolve to regain
more influence over world prices, and it bore the stamp of Iraq.
   Producing above quota means more revenue for the country
involved, but it undermines efforts to keep prices high.
   That problem was behind Saddam Hussein's recent belligerence and
his call before the OPEC meeting for a $25 benchmark, widely
considered a bargaining tactic rather than a real goal.
   The Iraqi leader last week threatened to use military force
against overproducing OPEC members, saying their policies were
forcing down prices and cost his war-ravaged economy billions of
dollars in oil revenues.
   Iraq said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates were largely
responsible for the current oil glut, and Iraq reportedly massed
30,000 troops along the Kuwaiti border before the OPEC meeting.
   While diplomats say the forces are being withdrawn, Baghdad has
vowed to press claims over oil production and land in proposed
talks with Kuwait.
   OPEC efforts to prevent cheating on quotas via a special
committee have not helped much. Analysts say that may change now.
   ``We do have a monitoring committee, but with a membership of
one: Saddam Hussein,'' Barakat said.
   ``There's likely to be better production discipline due to the
political developments in the gulf,'' Rothman said.
   Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, OPEC's newly elected
president, opened the meeting Thursday with an appeal for halting
overproduction.
   He said low prices threatened to bring OPEC countries to the
brink of economic collapse.
   While other members may not agree with Iraq's methods, they
privately welcome moves to stop cheating, Barakat said.
   ``They were totally perplexed how they could make U.A.E. and the
Kuwaitis stick to their quotas,'' he said. ``There is certainly a
lot of sympathy for Iraq trying to force the cheaters to come back
into the fold.''

   Roseanne Barr admits she can't
carry a tune but refused to apologize for a caterwauling version of
the national anthem sung before booing baseball fans.
   Even President Bush showed his displeasure Friday.
   ``I'm sorry I didn't sing so good,'' the star of the top-rated
ABC-TV comedy ``Roseanne'' said of her screeching rendition
Wednesday night before 30,000 fans attending a doubleheader in San
Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium.
   ``What else do I have to say? I figured everybody knew I wasn't
the world's greatest singer.''
   Barr said she nearly left the field in mid-song as fans of the
San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati Reds bombarded her with boos.
   To top it off, it was ``Working Woman's Night'' at the ballpark.
Barr, whose show chronicles the triumphs and struggles of a blue
collar wife and mother with three kids, denied she was
disrespectful.
   ``I represent a certain part of America that probably nobody
else represents,'' she said. ``And I came out of someplace and got
someplace, and I've got a right to sing the song.''
   She recalled how in the first few notes of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' she knew things were going wrong.
   ``Then everybody started booing me and I went into this panic
thing,'' she said at a raucous news conference Friday at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel. ``It took all the guts I've got in my life to
finish singing.''
   More than 2,000 phone calls about the unmelodious performance
had come into the Padres switchboard by midday Friday.
   Barr said she had the best of intentions. She refused to
apologize, although she used the word ``sorry'' several times.
   ``I'm not going to apologize for doing it,'' she said. ``But not
anybody anticipated that it would be this negative.''
   She capped her solo by grabbing her crotch and spitting _
actions she described as a parody of a baseball player, not a
response to the boos.
   ``I probably should have waited a while before I scratched
myself and spit,'' she said. ``But I wanted to get out of there.''
   The news conference became as chaotic as her TV family on
``Roseanne'' when her husband, Tom Arnold, ordered police to eject
a tabloid photographer.
   Photographer Kip Rano of American Photo Syndicate was led from a
meeting room of the hotel after police warned he would be
handcuffed and arrested if he refused to leave.
   In a Hollywood twist, Rano was escorted out by police Officer
Paul Kramer _ the same motorcyclist who arrested and was slapped by
actress Zsa Zsa Gabor last year.
   Barr said she had Rano expelled because ``I'm not going to talk
to the tabloids. I'm suing them.''
   Rano said his firm sells photos to ``everyone,'' including
tabloid newspapers. He called the expulsion a publicity stunt by
Arnold and Barr.
   Barr said her planned lawsuit against the National Enquirer
would not be filed until next week.
   President Bush joined a chorus of boos for Barr's rendition of
the anthem.
   It was ``disgraceful,'' Bush said while flying to Kennebunkport,
Maine, for the weekend. ``That's the way I feel about it and I
think a lot of San Diego fans said the same thing.''
   Told of Bush's comment, Barr replied: ``I'm sorry I didn't sing
so good. I'd like to hear him sing it.''

   Police are investigating the deaths of young boys
who reportedly were killed during the filming of pornographic
movies in London, Scotland Yard said.
   Scotland Yard said Friday that it is looking into news reports
that up to a dozen young boys were sexually abused and slain in
videos being sold by child pornography rings in Britain, Europe and
the United States.
   Detective Superintendent Michael Hames, head of Scotland Yard's
child pornography squad, said his investigators have not found any
such films.
   ``To date we have not discovered any snuff movies,'' he said.
``We don't say they don't exist but we have not seized any. We
don't know if they are being done here.''
   Conservative lawmaker Geoffrey Dickens, who has been leading a
10-year crusade against child pornography, called on Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to ``publicly warn all parents to become
busybodies about the whereabouts of their children.''
   A Scotland Yard statement said a special squad of East London
detectives was ``investigating the disappearance of a number of
young boys dating back over a period of six years. The squad are
also investigating the deaths of young boys during the making of
films made in London and dating back to 1984.''
   Detectives are believed to be studying the files of 20 missing
boys, media reports said.
   Scotland Yard appealed for witnesses ``who may have been
involved in the making of these films, who may have suffered sexual
abuse or have any information.''
   Police sources said the investigation has been under way for
more than a year.
   Scotland Yard said an unidentified prisoner will appear in court
Monday on charges of killing 6-year-old Barry Lewis, who vanished
from near his south London home in September 1985. His body was
found two years later in a shallow grave.
   Police still are investigating the boy's death and are looking
into the activities of a number of other people in connection with
the murder, Scotland Yard said. Police sources said some of these
people may also be serving prison sentences.

   Lawmakers maneuvered to override Gov.
Buddy Roemer's second veto in a month of legislation that would
have made Louisiana the toughest anti-abortion state.
   ``Where I stand now reflects the majority of the people of this
state,'' Roemer said. ``That does not mean it reflects the majority
of the Legislature. That's to be determined and that's fair.''
   The bill Roemer vetoed Friday would have prohibited abortions
except to save the life of the mother and in cases of aggravated
rape and incest reported to police and a physician no more than a
week after they occurred.
   On July 6, Roemer vetoed an even tougher bill lacking the
exceptions for rape and incest. Two-thirds majorities in both
legislative chambers are required to override a veto; an override
of the earlier veto passed the House but fell three votes short in
the Senate.
   No Louisiana governor's veto has been overriden this century.
   Now, the 144 state legislators will be sent ballots next week to
determine if they want to call a special override session in August.
   ``We ask every woman and man to stand with the governor, to urge
the Legislature not to come back,'' said Teri Bartlett, director of
Planned Parenthood of Louisiana. ``Enough is enough. This bill has
embarrassed our state, terrorized our women and families.''
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, a Democrat who leads the anti-abortion
group, said he would try again to override Roemer's July 6 veto.
   The measure vetoed Friday was thrown together by the Legislature
_ which has only three women members _ the day before its regular
session ended July 9.
   Roemer said the bill was insensitive to women.
   ``It might serve us well, legislators and governors, who tend to
be predominantly male, to take time to listen to the viewpoint of
women,'' Roemer said.
   ``One of the most burdensome things about the bill that I vetoed
today is that it did not listen at all,'' Roemer said.
   Roemer said ``rape is treated unevenly and unfairly,'' and said
only aggravated rape would be excepted under the bill. It did not
protect victims of simple rape, defined in Louisiana as sexual
intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting, such as when
she is drunk, unconscious or afraid of the rapist.
   ``It's like simple rape was non-existent. It was like if a woman
was mentally retarded she had no right and was fair game. How
insensitive can you be?''
   If the bill becomes law, doctors who perform abortions could be
sentenced to 10 years in prison and $100,000 fines. The bill was
designed to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   Athough Roemer declared he remained ``pro life,''
anti-abortionists branded him an abortion-rights governor.
   ``We are going to override this governor,'' said Sue Fontenot, a
city council member in Eunice and a member of Louisiana's Right to
Life organization.
   ``He's betrayed the pro-life majority that elected him,'' said
Nancy Myers, spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee
in Washington. ``He's using phony excuses to hide the fact that he
doesn't care at all for unborn children.''
   Abortion-rights advocates said they were heartened.
   ``Governor Roemer's decision to veto the anti-abortion bill was
a rational and reasonable decision,'' said Joy Gilmore, president
of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women.

   State officials called for federal cooperation if
Cubans decide to take seriously a remark by President Fidel Castro
for the United States to accept another wave of refugees similar to
the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   ``We cannot tolerate another Mariel. There is no way the
community can absorb it,'' said Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino.
More than 120,000 Cubans fled to Florida over a five-month period
in 1980.
   Miami area leaders say they would need help in resettling
refugees as well as federal controls on the numbers of visas to
avoid another chaotic exodus.
   ``One can hardly oppose the free emigration from Cuba of people
who are seeking freedom,'' said Miami's Cuban-born mayor, Xavier
Suarez.
   ``We need the usual safeguards and guarantees so we wouldn't get
people from jails. There should be a plan with people going to
other parts of the country, and not all people into one community.''
   Asylum-seekers packed the Peruvian Embassy in Havana in 1980,
prompting the boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel. A ragtag
armada of Cuban-Americans sailed across the Florida Straits
believing they were picking up relatives, friends and political
prisoners, but some were forced to return with convicted criminals
and vagrants.
   Today, most experts agree that fewer than 10 percent of the
``Marielitos'' were criminals. About 2,600 are still in federal
custody, 173 were returned to Cuba and an estimated 4,000 are in
various state and local prisons.
   In a speech Thursday on the 37th anniversary of the beginning of
the Cuban revolution, Castro invited the United States and other
nations to issue entrance visas and send boats to pick up refugees.
   In a sarcastic tone, Castro dared ``the Yankees'' if ``they want
to receive these poor, persecuted citizens, let them send the boats
and the visas.''
   Cuban exiles in Miami said they believed the speech was solely
intended to embarrass the United States.
   ``Fidel knows that the U.S. is in no position to issue tens of
thousands of visas. What Castro is trying to tell Cubans is, `If
you want to leave then leave, but they don't want you there,'''
said Tomas Regalado, news director at WAQF-AM, a Spanish-language
radio station.
   Under a 1984 agreement for orderly emigration, Cubans wishing to
leave for the United States can go to the U.S. diplomatic mission
in Havana and apply for visas. Last year, 10,046 Cubans were
allowed to come here as immigrants, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the agency has a contingency
plan for a Mariel-type refugee surge, and a change in the Cuban
refugee flow might require a revision of the plan.
   ``But at the moment there is no reason to believe a boatlift
situation is imminent,'' he said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Alastair Worden said there were no reports
Friday of Cuban-Americans launching vessels to the island.
   So far this year, 216 Cuban refugees have been found this year
in boats and home-made vessels floating toward Florida, said
Worden. Last year, 390 Cubans were rescued by the Coast Guard.

   In bidding to make the Hubble Space Telescope
mirrors, Eastman Kodak planned independent tests that could have
detected before its launch the focusing flaw that now cripples the
$1.5 billion orbiting observatory, a company official says.
   Eastman Kodak planned to team with Itel Optical Systems to make
two primary mirrors for the space telescope, according to documents
released Friday by NASA in response to a Freedom of Information
petition.
   The companies were to cross-check the accuracy of their mirrors
to assure they were of the correct prescription and then one of the
mirrors would be used on the telescope.
   NASA officials, however, awarded the contract in 1977 to
Perkin-Elmer. The Danbury, Conn. firm, now known as Hughes Danbury
Optical Systems, ground the mirrors itself and used its own
personnel and equipment to check the mirror prescriptions.
   Perkin-Elmer's winning bid was $64.28 million. Kodak's proposal
was for $99.79 million. Through overruns and delays, the cost of
the Perkin-Elmer contract climbed to an eventual total of $451
million.
   The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in April and has been
found to have a focusing flaw in either the primary or secondary
mirror. This error, NASA officials have said, means the telescope
is now able to capture images that are only about half as clear as
those planned.
   Dick Wollensak, a vice president of Itek, which is now a
subsidiary of Litton Industries, said that the losing Kodak-Itek
bid called for a so-called ``end-to-end'' test that would have
detected any flaw in the mirrors before the telescope was launched.
   ``We weren't going to build those things and then not test them
after they were assembled,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Between Kodak and Itek, there were facilities to test the
assembled optical system without a major modification.''
   NASA officials have said that the completed Perkin-Elmer optical
assembly was not tested because it would have required a test
facility that may have cost more than $100 million. As a result,
the telescope was launched into space without ever being optically
tested as an assembled unit. The focusing error was not discovered
until the telescope was in orbit.
   Wollensak said the Perkin-Elmer design did not allow for the
primary mirror to be tested after it was placed into the assembled
telescope. He said the instrument was designed to work in zero
gravity and the gravity of Earth caused the glass to sag slightly,
which would have changed the focus.
   Kodak and Itel, however, had developed a way to prevent the sag
and thus test the mirrors as an assembled unit, Wollensak said.
   Wollensak said he believes cost was a major factor in NASA
selectinig Perkin-Elmer to make the Hubble optics.
   ``NASA had developed their own version of what it should cost
and that was lower than the Itek-Kodak bid,'' Wollensak said.
``They felt that the Perkin-Elmer bid was low, but they though that
the difference between the NASA expectation and the Perkin-Elmer
bid would cover the overrun.''
   As it turned out, the final, actual cost was seven times more
than the Perkin-Elmer bid. Wollensak said the Kodak-Itel bid would
have avoided many of the problems that led to the Perkin-Elmer
overruns.
   A NASA committee investigating the flawed Hubble telescope plans
to return to Perkin-Elmer's plan in Danbury on Aug. 15 for two more
days of testimony and a review of documents and equipment related
to the flawed optics.
   The committee met for two days this week in Danbury and an
engineer who was there said it may take weeks to find the precise
mistake that caused the flawed focus.
   The engineer, who asked for anonymity, said the investigation is
like looking for a bookkeeping error. It will go on and on.''

   President Bush says he's pleased
with the initial reaction his Supreme Court nominee has received
from senators and says New Hampshire jurist David Souter seems to
have ``broad support'' for the post.
   At the same time, the president said he has no comment on highly
critical comments of both him and Souter by Justice Thurgood M.
Marshall.
   ``I have a very high regard for separation of powers and for the
Supreme Court. And thus, I think people can get along without a
comment from me on this interview,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air
Force One on Friday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, however, told a Boston news
conference he was saddened by Marhsall's remarks.
   ``I believe it is the first time any sitting Supreme Court
justice has ever in our history criticized an appointment and
indeed criticized the president who made the appointment,''
Thornburgh said.
   ``I don't believe that is a constructive attitude to have on the
eve of consideration by the Senate of the nomination of a man
possessed by extraordinary qualitites of intellect, integrity and
character.''
   The president is spending the weekend at his oceanside family
vacation home.
   Marshall said in a television interview on Thursday that he had
never heard of Bush's nominee and believed some one else should
have been given the appointment.
   In the interview on ABC-TV, Marshall also said he considered
Bush to be ``dead'' and that Chief of Staff John Sununu was
``calling the shots.''
   Souter, whom Sununu appointed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
when Sununu was governor in the 1980s, hitched a ride on Air Force
One on Friday.
   He and Bush parted at Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H.
Souter was expected to spend the weekend at his home in Weare,
N.H., and return to Washington on Monday.
   Souter, who has a reputation as a man of a few words, wandered
back to the press section of Air Force One by himself at one point
and said: ``I don't want to ruin my reputation. I have two things
to say. Hi and Goodbye.''
   Bush said it's hard to gauge how the Senate will vote because
``a lot have not expressed their views.''
   But, he said he had received upbeat assessments on Souter's
chances from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking Republican on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, and from Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., who is Souter's chief Senate sponsor.
   Bush conceded that Souter's position on many issues was unknown,
but he said, ``I think he's not the most well-known figure in the
country, but that's not why I selected him. So he'll be plenty
well-known when he gets testifying and gets through this process,
which I think he'll do with flying colors.''
   Bush said that although he had not sought Souter's views on
controversial subjects like abortion, he had not agreed to a
condition against grilling the nominee on such issues.
   ``No. Nothing on my side on that,'' he said.
   Rudman, who was also aboard Air Force One, had said Souter had
told him he did not want to come to Washington if it meant that the
president or others in the administration would ask him questions
on potential decisions.
   Rudman said he had relayed the concern to Sununu, who had told
him ``that is not our policy.'' Rudman said he then passed along
those reassurances to Souter.
   The taciturn Souter has been ``in a state of near shock'' for
the past few days, but has come out of it, Rudman told reporters on
Air Force One.
   Meanwhile, Bush, who has championed a constitutional amendment
to prohibit flag desecration, said that he was unhappy by the
rendition given to the National Anthem earlier this week at a
baseball game in San Diego by comedienne Roseanne Barr.
   ``My reaction is, it was disgraceful. That's the way I feel
about it, and I think a lot of the San Diego fans said the same
thing.''
   Asked if he would stop watching her television show, Bush said:
``What show?''
   Asked if she would not receive an invitation to the White House,
the president said: ``There's no change of plans in that.''
   Bush managed to get in 18 holes of golf on Friday after
arriving. He planned to go boating today, then to attend the
wedding here of a distant relative.
   He returns to Washington late Sunday, with no public events
scheduled.

   A Marine Corps helicopter crashed in the
desert while on a training mission, killing two of the five Marines
on board, authorities said today.
   The three survivors were taken to a hospital, but the extent of
their injuries was not immediately disclosed.
   The UH-1N Huey helicopter crashed at 9:25 p.m. Friday in the
Chocolate Mountain Bombing Range, about 55 miles west of the Marine
Corps Air Station at Yuma, said Lance Cpl. Lisa Rodriguez.
   The victims' identities were being withheld until relatives
could be notified, Rodriguez said.
   The injured Marines were transported to Yuma Regional Medical
Center, where they were in stable condition, Rodriguez said. Kris
Ozuna, a nursing supervisor at the hospital, said the extent of
their injuries was still being evaluated.
   The helicopter was assigned to the Medium Light Attack
Helicopter Squadron 367, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Camp
Pendleton, Calif., Rodriguez said.
   The helicopter was carrying practice rockets and small caliber
ammunition when the crash occurred, she said. The squadron has been
at the Yuma air station for two weeks of training exercises that
began July 20.

   Investigators said it could be several
weeks before they know what killed Brent Mydland, keyboard player
for the popular counterculture rock band Grateful Dead.
   Mydland, 37, was found dead Thursday at his home in the San
Francisco suburb of Lafayette. He had returned home Tuesday night
from a three-week national tour with the band.
   An autopsy Friday morning failed to show how Mydland died, said
Sgt. Richard Terry of the Contra Costa County coroner's office. He
said toxicological tests will take two to four weeks.
   There were no indications of foul play, Terry said.
   The Tribune of Oakland quoted law enforcement sources saying no
drugs or signs of drug use was found in Mydland's house. The
sources were not identified.
   Grieving fans and friends sent cards, faxes and flowers to the
band, band spokesman Dennis McNally said.
   ``We've got many calls of sympathy _ thousands. A lot of love
and a lot of caring,'' McNally said. ``Our audience does care about
the band, and this is a great loss.''
   McNally said he assumed the band would go on with concerts
scheduled in August and September in California, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and New York City and in October in Sweden, West Germany, France
and England.
   The Grateful Dead formed in 1965. The band, which tours
extensively, is known for songs including ``Truckin''' and ``Touch
of Grey,'' and for its devoted fans, ``Deadheads,'' who follow the
band from show to show.
   Mydland joined the band in 1979. He also sang and composed
songs, including ``Far From Me.''

<HEAD>Black Moslems Take Prime Minister and Cabinet Hostage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A black Moslem leader said his
rebels captured Prime Minister Arthur Robinson and his Cabinet in
the Parliament building Friday, and claimed to have toppled the
government of this southern Caribbean nation.
   But government radio early today broadcast a condemnation of the
uprising and said police had moved into the streets of the capital
to bring order in this mainly Catholic and Hindu country. There
were no immediate reports of casualties.
   The attack on Parliament came Friday as the capital's police
headquarters was blown up and explosions and gunfire were heard in
the direction of the government's television station, which the
rebels seized.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' leader Abu Bakr of
Jamaat al-Muslimeen, Arabic for the Moslem Group, said on
government television.
   He promised ``free and fair'' elections within 90 days in
Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony of 1.3 million people
on two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The country has a
1,500-member army and a 5,000-member police force.
   British West Indies Airways and American Airlines canceled
commercial flights into Trinidad Friday evening, but the Piarco
International Airport remained under control of government security
forces.
   The National Broadcasting Service's Radio 610, the government
radio station, said Robinson and his Cabinet were being held in the
Red House, the Parliament building across the street from the
central police station.
   Radio 610 said the police station was blown up and burned out of
control for hours. Announcer Dennis McComie said no one attempted
to put out the fire and there were several explosions of what he
assumed was ammunition in the station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at 6 p.m. to announce the
uprising by Jamaat al-Muslimeen.
   In Washington, State Department Spokesman Dave Denny said, ``We
would deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
Trinidad.''
   Denny said the U.S. Embassy had reported gunfire and explosions
in the vicinity of the TV station, which is several miles northwest
of the parliamentary building, but only a few blocks below the
hillside Hilton Hotel.
   Denny said he had no word about the situation of Americans in
Trinidad and Tobago. The smaller island of Tobago is a popular
vacation site.
   Bakr said there was no plan for violence, looting or retribution
against civilians.
   Acting President Emmanuel Carter told Radio 610 that people
should pray for a solution to the situation.
   ``Stay at home and let the protected (police) forces do their
jobs,'' he said.
   McComie said at 3 a.m. today that there had been some looting
and police had moved into the streets for the first time since the
country's leading officials were seized.
   Radio 610 broadcast a statement from David Coore, Jamaican
foreign affairs minister, deploring the uprising. His comments were
heard on Radio 610 on a relay from Radio Jamaica.
   ``We call urgently and directly on those responsible for this
totally unacceptable situation to release the hostages
unconditionally and pursue whatever complaints they have by the
regular processes of constitutional democracy which are the
hallmark of our Caribbean Community,'' Coore said.
   Caribbean heads of state and their ministers were to meet this
weekend in the Jamaican capital of Kingston for the annual meeting
the Caribbean common market. Trinidad Foreign Affairs Minister
Sahadeo Basdeo is in Kingston.
   It could not be ascertained how many ministers were taken
hostage with Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and
economist.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, is a former Trinidad policeman and has
been arrested several times in the past on charges of contempt of
court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of Port-of-Spain. Members of the
sect, founded in 1980, are widely perceived in Trinidad as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   Abu Bakr has said he doesn't recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   In November of 1988, police raided the sect's sanctuary and
seized weapons and ammunition. Bakr said then he was waging a war
against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding. Trinidad published reports say Abu
Bakr has visited Libya.
   Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain in 1962. It
is an English-speaking country with a large populace from India.
   About a third of the people are Roman Catholic and a quarter are
Hindu. Only about 6 percent are Moslem, most of them East Indians.
There is great tension between the black and Indian Moslems.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by Libya.

<HEAD>U.S., ASEAN Discuss Formation of Cambodian Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
and Southeast Asian nations were at odds today over whether
communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas should be included in a Cambodian
transitional government.
   ``If we are serious about the objective of Cambodian
self-determination, we need ... to urge the formation of a supreme
national council and the holding of U.N.-organized elections,''
Baker said.
   ``That impetus can come from offering new diplomatic incentives,
and from showing no tolerance for the Khmer Rouge's dialogue of
death,'' he said at the annual meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.
   The Khmer Rouge, known for their brutal rule of Cambodia from
1975-78, are militarily the strongest rebel group fighting an
11-year-old war against the Vietnamese-backed Communist government
in Phnom Penh. Two other rebel groups are non-communist.
   ASEAN comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei
and Indonesia. They scheduled a series of meetings today in their
annual dialogue with major trading partners _ the United States,
Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European Community.
   The association holds that a Cambodian national council would
have to include ``all shades of political opinion,'' including the
Khmer Rouge.
   Baker announced last week that the United States would withdraw
recognition of the United Nations seat held by the three-member
Cambodia resistance coalition because it includes the Khmer Rouge.
The group is blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths when it
ruled Cambodia from 1975-78 and now threatens a military comeback.
   Baker said Washington would open talks with Vietnam and possibly
Phnom Penh itself to try to end the fighting.
   ASEAN wants the Cambodian guerrilla coalition to form the
council, which would occupy the U.N. seat at the next session of
the General Assembly.
   The association expects former head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk to play a key role. His non-communist followers plus
anti-communists under former Premier Son Sann make up the weaker
portion of the coalition.
   Sihanouk issued a statement from Pyongyang, North Korea, this
week that said there would be no peace in Cambodia unless the Khmer
Rouge were allowed to participate in a political settlement on an
equal footing with other warring factions.
   A series of inconclusive peace talks since 1988 sponsored by
ASEAN has included the representatives of the Khmer Rouge,
Sihanouk, Son Sann and Premier Hun Sen's Phnom Penh government.
   As envisioned by ASEAN, the supreme council would be headed by
Sihanouk and serve as a repository for Cambodian sovereignty until
free elections could be held under U.N. auspices.
   In other developments at the ASEAN meeting:
   _ Baker on Friday said the United States had done its share in
helping Indochinese refugees and that criticism of U.S. policy was
unfair.
   The ASEAN has criticized the United States and Vietnam for
opposing the compulsory return of people who do not qualify as
political refugees and at the same time not providing alternate
solutions. Baker countered that since 1975, the United States has
resettled 900,000 of 1.7 million Southeast Asian refugees and taken
120,000 more from Vietnam alone.
   _ A senior U.S. State Department official said the sultanate of
Brunei has joined Singapore in offering American armed forces
access to its territory.
   Singapore and Washington are negotiating an arrangement for
increased use by U.S. warships and planes of the island's
facilities.
   ``Brunei is also prepared for an enhanced security
relationship,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The oil-rich sultanate on the north coast of Borneo is expanding
its navy with new patrol boats and buying its first fixed-wing
combat aircraft _ 16 British-built Hawks.

<HEAD>Residents Begin to Rebuild Lives One Month After Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One month after a wind-swept wildfire
destroyed hundreds of homes in the hills above Santa Barbara,
residents are festooning the streets with banners for next week's
annual fiesta.
   ``After the fire, the community was struck by an incredible
feeling of shock,'' said spokeswoman Diana Vandervort. ``We're
hoping the fiesta will foster a spirit of community rebuilding.''
   The June 27 blaze killed a woman, left hundreds homeless and
wrought more than $250 million in damages in an area north of Santa
Barbara.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, an 350-acre arson fire
destroyed 46 homes and damaged 26 others the same day. Damage there
was estimated between $30 million and $40 million.
   ``We were wondering if we really still had anything to
celebrate,'' said Peter Georgi, an insurance agent who is directing
Santa Barbara's Old Spanish Days fiesta, the biggest tourism event
of the year for the city of 300,000. The five-day celebration
begins Wednesday.
   Georgi, who had 10 clients lose homes in the blaze, said he
asked them what they thought as he handed out claim checks. ``They
said to go ahead, that they didn't have anything else to look
forward to,'' he said in an interview.
   Red, green and yellow flags already line the fiesta's main
thoroughfare. Food booths and stages are going up for the 100,000
people organizers hope will attend.
   The parade starting the fiesta will be dedicated to Andrea Lang
Gurka, 37, who died as she tried to flee flames roaring toward her
canyon home. Those who were left homeless also will be remembered.
   Mrs. Gurka's husband, Michael, said he wants to help educate
people about fire safety and raise $100,000 to disseminate
information on such things as fire-retardant buildings and
prevention of post-fire soil erosion.
   ``I'm trying to find some meaning in this,'' Gurka, 36, told
viewers of a July 6 fire-relief telethon. ``If we can educate
people about fire, then potential human life won't be lost.''
   In the fire-ravaged neighborhoods, surviving homes topped with
manufactured roofing materials stand stark amid the ruins. New city
and county ordinances require shingles of clay, metal or cement.
Wood shake roofs, which exploded in flames the night of the fire,
are now banned.
   Santa Barbara County says 441 single family homes were touched
by the blaze, and 427 were destroyed along with 98 individual
apartments. But the Red Cross, basing its figure on the number of
families who have registered with the disaster agency, estimates
630 residences were destroyed.
   The county, strapped by a $4 million deficit before the fire,
lost $5 million in public buildings and 20 patrol cars.
   Tourism has dropped by 10 percent to 15 percent, said spokesman
Michael Forbes of the city's Tourism and Information Bureau. But
the area's 4,700 hotel and motel rooms are booked solid for the
festival, he said.
   ``What people don't realize is that the city of Santa Barbara
did not burn down,'' he said. ``All of the attractions, the hotels,
the shops, the beaches, all the reasons why people come Santa
Barbara _ none of that was affected.''

<HEAD>Witness: Secord, Southern Air Sought to Hide Roles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Richard Secord and a cargo carrier once owned by
the CIA took pains to hide their involvement in the illegal supply
of arms to the Nicaraguan Contras during the mid-1980s, according
to testimony at a federal trial.
   The family of William Sawyer Jr. and Eugene Hasenfus, sole
survivor of a October 1986 crash in Nicaragua, claimed Friday that
Secord and Southern Air Transport misrepresented the supply mission
and skimped on safety equipment.
   Sawyer died when the Sandinistas shot down the C-123 cargo plane
as it ferried supplies to the U.S.-backed rebels. The incident
helped unravel the Iran-Contra affair.
   In the trial of a federal damage lawsuit, attorneys for Hasenfus
and the Sawyer family are seeking a preliminary estimate of $3.4
million, including expenses caused by the crash and lost income.
   Secord, a retired Air Force general who pleaded guilty to lying
to Congress about Iran-Contra, and the Miami-based airliner deny
they were legally responsible for Hasenfus and Sawyer. They also
contend that the men knew the risks they were taking.
   Richard Gadd, who helped National Security Council aide Oliver
North, Secord and Southern Air set up the operation, said in
written testimony Friday that the use of Corporate Air Services and
other companies was designed to hide who was behind the supply
effort.
   Southern Air was once owned by the CIA and continued to do
contract work for the U.S. government, Gadd said.
   Gadd and Southern Air President William Langton decided the
effort ``should be treated as a clandestine or covert activity (so
the) media could not attempt to trace it back to the owners and the
United States government,'' the deposition said.
   Gadd said Secord directed the funds and made policy decisions in
the enterprise, a major point for Hasenfus, who is trying to prove
that Secord was his real employer.
   In another development, Gadd referred to comments by Langton
that former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez had advised then-Vice
President George Bush of problems with the supply effort. Rodriguez
helped run the Contra supply operation out of El Salvador.
   Rodriguez testified Friday about equipment problems with the
planes, especially in early 1986. In June 1986, he brought North a
letter from crewmen complaining their navigational equipment was
inadequate.
   Over the strong objections of Southern Air attorneys, Rodriguez
testified that the only radar detection devices aboard were Radio
Shack ``fuzz busters,'' designed to allow drivers to spot police
patrol cars on the highway.
   But Rodriguez said that after he left the supply operation by
September 1986, he understood that flights had increased and
equipment had improved.
   The former agent left the CIA in 1976, and is credited with
capturing Cuban leader Fidel Castro's close ally Ernesto ``Che''
Guevara in Bolivia. He also was a veteran of the Bay of Pigs
invasion in 1961.

   Rebels fought in the streets of the
capital with troops loyal to President Samuel Doe, and one rebel
leader claimed to have set up his own government.
   Doe, through a spokesman, maintained Friday he would never
resign as leader of this West African nation and predicted his
troops would defeat the rebels within two weeks.
   The spokesman, who was not identified, spoke in a radio
telephone call to the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   Later Friday, Radio ELWA outside Monrovia broadcast a speech by
rebel leader Charles Taylor in which he claimed to have established
his own government. No details were given in the speech from the
missionary station, which apparently had been taken over by
Taylor's supporters.
   In a similar uprising in 1985, rebels took over a Liberian radio
station and made a broadcast in which they claimed to have ousted
Doe. The claim proved groundless.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman David Denny said U.S.
officials were aware of Taylor's latest broadcast but that they had
no indication the 7-month-old civil war was over.
   ``On the contrary, fighting continues,'' he said. He declined
comment on specifics of what Taylor said.
   Troops loyal to Taylor, the National Patriotic Front president,
remained blocked by government troops in Paynesville, more than six
miles from the city center.
   The more than 300 rebels who invaded the center of Monrovia by
two bridges Friday were supporters of rival rebel leader Prince
Johnson.
   They took control of streets on the banks of the Mesurado River
and told residents to leave by way of the captured bridges.
Witnesses said hundreds heeded the order.
   Rebels have fought their way into the city on other occasions,
but either withdrew or were driven out.
   This time, some government soldiers were seen stripping off
their uniforms, throwing away their rifles and fleeing in civilian
clothes as the rebels advanced.
   More than 100 government troops were sent to the waterfront area
and heavy fighting ensued.
   Battles also broke out in the diplomatic quarter of Mamba Point
and government troops sent heavy artillery to a hill overlooking
the city center close to dipolmatic missions.
   Meanwhile, Doe remained in the executive mansion in a last-ditch
attempt to prevent a takeover by rebels.
   Panicky soldiers carried out random arrests of civilians,
accusing them of supporting the rebels.
   Responding to witness accounts of a spate of tribal killings by
government soldiers this week, acting Information Minister Paul
Allen Wie said such kilings were ``not government policy.''
   A communique issued by five European Community ambassadors in
Monrovia on Thursday condemned the summary executions of 100 Gio
and Mano tribesmen. Many of the rebels come from those ethnic
groups.
   The rebels also are accused of killing members of tribes that
support Doe.
   Doe's defense minister, Boimah Barclay, went to the John F.
Kennedy hospital in the city, where dozens of people were rounded
up by soldiers Wednesday, and ``took action to prevent any further
killing,'' Wie said.
   The rebels, who began their offensive in December, accuse the
government of corruption and human rights abuses.
   At least 375,000 Liberians have fled the fighting into
neighboring Guinea, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in Geneva. The U.N.
appointed a special representative Friday to coordinate relief
operations.

<HEAD>Queen's Lawyers Win Publication Ban on Ex-Employees's Memoirs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A High Court judge has issued a temporary
injunction banning a book that reportedly gives intimate details
about Britain's Royal family.
   Justice Michael Wright on Friday banned author Malcolm Barker
from publishing his book, ``Courting Disaster,'' anywhere in the
world, but stayed the ban until 4:30 Monday afternoon, pending an
appeal.
   The injunction also forbids Barker's publisher, Fleetwood
Publications, from selling the book in Britain.
   Lawyers for Barker and Fleetwood Publications said they will
appeal the part of the court order that bans Barker from publishing
outside Britain.
   Barker worked from 1980 to 1983 as a lowly storeman-clerk to the
master of the royal household at Buckingham Palace.
   The book makes disclosures that lawyers for Queen Elizabeth II
claim breach a confidentiality agreement signed by Barker when he
joined the palace staff.
   Royal staff are required to sign agreements not to disclose
details of what they see and hear while in royal service as a
legally binding contractual condition of employment.
   The injunction will remain in effect until the High Court hears
an action, brought by the attorney general on behalf of the queen,
to permanently ban the book and to direct any profits from the book
to the attorney general.
   If Barker, who lives in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia but
is currently visiting Britain, disobeys the order he could be
jailed and face heavy fines for contempt of court.
   Angered by behind-the-scenes disclosures by former employees,
the palace in recent years has increasingly reverted to legal
action to suppress a succession of spicy memoirs.
   ``Courting Disaster,'' published by the Nova-Scotia based
Fleetwood Publications, is on sale in Canada, the United States and
Bermuda, said Barker's lawyer, David Fowell.
   Fowell said 20,000 copies of the book had been printed and
magazine serialization rights had been sold to Australian, American
and French magazines.
   Lawyers for Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday obtained an injunction
against an eight-page excerpt of the book in the current edition of
the French publication, Paris Match. The excerpt was removed from
the 8,000 copies of the magazine sold in Britain.

   Automakers bade farewell to the
legendary Citroen Deux Chevaux, conceived by its French designer as
a ``four-wheeled sofa covered by an umbrella.''
   The last car rolled off the factory line Friday after 42 years
in production, and the finale took place in Portugal, where Citroen
moved production after shutting down its Levallois assembly line
near Paris.
   There were no public ceremonies at the Mangualde factory, ``just
a little get-together for the workers who have been making them,''
said a Citroen Lusitania spokesman, Teixeira de Abreu.
   But Citroen fans worldwide will mourn the demise of the
turtle-shaped Deux Chevaux _ named literally for ``two horses,'' or
the horsepower produced by its chugging air-cooled engine.
   It was officially designated the 2CV and came with open-flap
side-windows, mattress-like suspension and scrawny tires. More than
3.86 million were sold since the launch at the 1948 Paris Auto show
for $650.
   Including a van, more comfortable Ami and Dyane versions, and
even a four-wheel drive derivative, more than 7 million Deux
Chevaux have hit the roads. Thousands of fans have set up about 300
owners' clubs worldwide.
   Citroen's hi-tech AX compact will substitute the 2CV at the
Mangualde plant. But, according to Gavin Green, chief editor of
Britain's Car Magazine, ``no car will replace it _ there's no
successor in sight. It's the end of an era.''
   He says most owners have an emotional relationship with their
2CV that, like the Volkswagen Beetle and the British-made Mini, has
become a motoring legend.
   In 1935, Citroen boss Pierre-Jules Boulanger asked his designers
to dream up a small, avant-garde car for all classes of folk that
would be like ``a four-wheeled sofa covered by an umbrella.''
   Boulanger demanded enough headroom for an opera-bound gentleman
wearing a top hat, but also a car supple enough to transport at
least two peasants with a basket of eggs across a ploughed field
without smashing their fragile cargo. All that without using more
than about 2.4 gallons of fuel for 60 miles.
   The first wooden mock-ups had one headlamp, a serrated hood that
looked like a cheese grater. Functional interior appointments
included a roll-back canvas roof, a hand-operated windshield wiper
and hammock seats.
   When World War II broke out in 1939, Boulanger had all but one
of the 250 running prototypes destroyed. He hid the survivor in a
barn.
   Available only in gray at the 1948 Paris launch, the Deux
Chevaux could manage a top speed of 37 mph. Sales soon rocketed and
in 1950, the waiting list was six years long.
   Sales began to slacken in the mid-1980s. The 2CV can no longer
meet emission laws in Switzerland and Austria, nor safety
regulations in Sweden and Finland.
   But Green is convinced that life could have begun at 40 for the
car that still has a loyal clientele in France, Britain, West
Germany, Belgium and Ireland.
   ``Sales are only dropping because Citroen isn't advertising _
there's no genuine reason to kill the car. I think they're a bit
embarrassed by it not fitting their hi-tech image.''

<HEAD>Zsa Zsa Begins 3-Day Sentence: For $85 A Day, Her Own Cell And TV
Dinners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor arrived at the city jail
in a black Mercedes to serve a three-day sentence as part of her
conviction for slapping a police officer.
   ``I looked around for a jail and thought El Segundo's would be
appropriate,'' Miss Gabor's lawyer, Harrison Bull, said Friday.
   The actress is paying $85 a day to stay in the jail, avoiding
having to do time with the general county jail population. Miss
Gabor, 72, has a private cell of her choice and will eat TV dinners.
   ``It costs about ... the same rate as the Hilton nowadays,''
Bull said.
   Miss Gabor checked out of her $15 million Bel-Air mansion and
into the city lockup in this gritty Los Angeles suburb known for
oil refineries.
   She was convicted of three misdemeanors after slapping a Beverly
Hills officer, Paul Kramer, in June 1989 when he pulled over her
Rolls-Royce for expired plates.
   A judge enforced a three-day jail sentence this May after
deciding she'd violated probation by failing to perform 120 hours
of community service at a shelter for homeless women.
   ``She seemed to be a very pleasant lady,'' when she was booked
into the jail about 1 p.m., said Fern Ruiz, a Police Department
records clerk.
   She'll be a free woman again at 1 p.m. Monday, Ruiz said.
   ``I'll tell you one thing. I didn't do anything wrong,'' Miss
Gabor said on her way to her 8-foot by 10-foot cell that has a
metal-frame bed, toilet, sink and not much else. She'll be allowed
to wear her own clothing.
   Ruiz said she'll spend her days doing clerical work.
   ``That's something she has expressed an interest in,'' Ruiz said.
   Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Rubin also ordered Miss
Gabor to pay nearly $13,000 in fines and restitution.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Abu Bakr, the Moslem leader whose
rebels captured the prime minister and his Cabinet in a coup
attempt, has been fighting with the government for years.
   Most recently, Bakr has been involved in a dispute over medical
supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by Libya and
prohibited by customs agents from entering the country.
   One of the first things Bakr did after taking the leaders
captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute
free medicine to the poor people of Trinidad and Tobago.
   Members of his sect, Jamaat al-Muslimeen, have long been
perceived by many Trinidadians as violent outlaws, although they
proclaim moralistic motives for their actions.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, founded Jamaat al-Muslimeen, Arabic for
``Group of Moslems,'' six years ago.
   He has said he does not recognize ``man's laws,'' but only ``the
law of almighty Allah.''
   On Friday, he said he understood ``the present suffering of the
people'' and that Prime Minister Arthur Robinson had been
overthrown by God.
   ``God has removed him,'' Bakr said on government television.
``No man, including me, has power. ... He gave us victory over the
prime minister.''
   Bakr, his 200 to 250 followers and their wives and children live
on a commune in western Port-of-Spain.
   In 1988, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
   Bakr, a former policeman, said then his vigilantes were waging a
war against ``the menace of cocaine.''
   On Friday, he said, ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and
drugs which there was no hope for the present regime to stop.''
   Moslems make up 6 percent of the population of Trinidad and
Tobago, a former British colony just off the northeast coast of
Venezuela. Of the nation's 1.3 million people, about 40 percent are
of African descent and the same proportion is of East Indian
descent.
   Most of the East Indians are Hindu. Most of the Africans are
Roman Catholic or Protestant. The nation's small Moslem population
is mostly East Indians with some Africans. But the black Moslem
population has grown since the black power movement began 20 years
ago, and Bakr's sect is the largest among them.

   Eight blacks were killed and
127 people arrested in township violence throughout the country,
police said today.
   The most serious incident occurred in Khayelitsha outside Cape
Town, where a mob stoned a private truck, causing the driver to
lose control, police said. The vehicle crashed into a crowd,
killing three women and a man.
   The bodies of four men who had been stabbed to death were found
at three separate sites in black areas in the eastern part of the
country, police added.
   Of the 127 people arrested, 74 were detained outside the
southern city of Port Elizabeth, where demonstrators refused a
police order to disperse, authorities said.
   The police unrest report also listed several incidents in which
youths stoned homes, police and private vehicles and set them
alight.
   The daily police report, which covers incidents from the
preceding 24 hours, did not provide additional details.
   Black townships throughout the country remain wracked by
violence despite plans by President F.W. de Klerk to dismantle
apartheid and negotiate a black-white power-sharing agreement.
   The violence has included confrontations between activists and
police as well as rival blacks groups battling each other for
supremacy.

   A pipe bomb exploded today on a crowded Tel
Aviv beach, injuring 15 people, hospital officials said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Army radio said
dozens of Arabs in the area were rounded up for questioning.
   The radio also said police were forced to protect Arab
beachgoers from angry Israelis and that one Israeli was detained
for attacking Arabs.
   Army radio said the pipe bomb was placed under the sand near a
life guard stand.
   Dr. Dianka Ledderman, deputy director of Tel Aviv's Ichilov
hospital, where the injured were taken, said one woman was in fair
condition and the other 14 were suffering from slight wounds from
shrapnel.
   It was the first bombing since July 1 when a letter bomb
exploded inside a staircase mail box, slightly injuring three
people.
   On May 28, one man was killed and nine injured when a bomb went
off in Jerusalem's Ben-Yehuda market. Two Palestinian groups, the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad and a Syrian-backed dissident faction
of the PLO, claimed responsibility for that attack.

   The presidents of the three Baltic republics said
today they will not join negotiations to rewrite the treaty that
created the Soviet Union, preferring instead to talk directly with
Moscow about obtaining independence.
   On Friday, the three republics agreed to bypass the Kremlin by
signing political and economic treaties with the Russian
Federation. Also on Friday, another Soviet republic, Byleorussia,
declared its sovereignty.
   Taken together, the three developments represent strong new
challenges to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He seeks a new
treaty with all 15 Soviet republics to transfer some powers from
the central government to local authorities seeking more autonomy
from Moscow.
   But today, the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said
they ``consider it impossible'' to participate in the rewriting of
the treaty.
   They said it would ``be best'' if negotiations with Moscow
``were held on the basis of the three-plus-one principle'' _ that
is, the three Baltic states plus the Soviet government.
   The statement was signed by Estonian President Arnold Ruutel,
Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov and Vytautas Landsbergis, the
president of Lithuania, which already plans talks with Moscow about
its independence.
   On Friday, Baltic leaders urgently called for talks with the
republic of Russia after meeting with its reformist president,
Boris N. Yeltsin. The meeting came during Yeltsin's vacation in the
Latvian beach resort of Jurmala.
   The presidents said the talks would be aimed at agreeing to
treaties between each Baltic state and Russia on ``political,
legal, economic, scientific and technical, cultural aspects of
mutual relations, on relations between nationalities and
citizenship.''
   Their statement, carried by the Estonian News Service, said the
treaties should be ready to sign within six to eight weeks. The
Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying the first treaty must
be ready to sign within 45 days.
   Tass reported early today that a Latvian delegation would go to
Moscow, the capital of both Russia and the Soviet Union, on Monday
to begin talks.
   Latvian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
treaties would probably include Russian recognition of the Baltics'
independence.
   Yeltsin was quoted as telling Latvian television he envisages
the treaties as agreements between equal and sovereign states.
   Meanwhile, Byelorussia, a republic that borders Poland, became
the ninth republic to take steps to distance itself from Moscow.
   The republic's Parliament Friday approved a declaration of
sovereignty, saying its laws take precedence over national laws and
that the republic has the right to run its own armed forces, Tass
reported.
   Russia, the Ukraine and Uzbekistan have also declared their
sovereignty, and the Ukraine claims the right to have its own armed
forces. The Georgian Parliament has condemned the republic's
annexation by the Soviet Union and called for negotiations on
independence.
   Moldavia's Parliament this week codified its June declaration of
sovereignty and approved a decree stating that all power in the
western republic belongs to the people.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11, and Latvia and
Estonia both have declared their intent to follow at the end of
unspecified transition periods. Lithuania said June 29 it would
freeze its declaration in return for an end to a Soviet economic
blockade and the start of talks on secession.
   Tass, reporting on the declaration approved in the Byelorussian
capital Minsk, said: ``It was decided that the republic has the
right to its own military forces, its interior forces, its organs
of state and public security, under the control of the republic's
Supreme Soviet.''
   ``Byelorussia establishes the superiority of the constitution
and laws of the republic on its territory and its independence in
external relations,'' Tass said. ``From now on, the republic will
officially celebrate its independence day on July 27.''

<TEXT>
   An Army helicopter crashed during
night training exercises, killing five soldiers and injuring eight
others, authorities said today.
   The Army UH-60 helicopter, known as a Blackhawk, crashed late
Friday night in a remote, wooded area of Fort Chaffee, in
west-central Arkansas just east of the Oklahoma state line, said
fort spokesman Cecil Green.
   It was one of two fatal military helicopter crashes Friday
night. The other, in California, killed two Marines.
   The Fort Chaffee chopper had been participating in routine night
training maneuvers at the Joint Readiness Training Center when the
crash occurred shortly before 11:30 p.m. about four miles south of
Charleston, Green said.
   As for the cause of the crash, ``the only thing we know is that
the helicopter was in radio contact with one of the team members on
the ground,'' he said. The ground unit notified headquarters of the
crash, he added.
   Five soldiers died and eight were injured, he said. Names of the
victims and the conditions of the injured were not immediately
released.
   Rescuers had to walk more than a mile to find the helicopter in
the hilly region north of the Ouchita Mountains, he said. Other
helicopters were used to get the injured to St. Edward Mercy
Medical Center at Fort Smith.
   In Southern California, meanwhile, a Marine Corps helicopter
crashed in the desert Friday night, killing two and injuring three
others, authorities said.
   The UH-1N Huey helicopter crashed in the Chocolate Mountain
Bombing Range in California, about 55 miles west of the Marine
Corps Air Station at Yuma, Ariz., said Marine Lance Cpl. Lisa
Rodriguez.
   The names of the two Marines killed were being withheld until
relatives could be notified, Rodriguez said.
   The three injured Marines were in stable condition at Yuma
Regional Medical Center, Rodriguez said. Kris Ozuna, a nursing
supervisor at the hospital, said their injuries were being
evaluated.
   The Huey was carrying practice rockets and small caliber
ammunition when the crash occurred about 9:25 p.m. PDT, Rodriguez
said. The squadron, based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., has been at
the Yuma air station since July 20 for two weeks of training
exercises.

   Fierce fighting raged today between rival
Shiite Moslem militias backed by Syria and Iran, leaving at least
16 combatants dead and 30 wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said artillery clashes first broke out between the
Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party
of God, at 3:30 a.m. on the northwestern edge of Iqlim al-Tuffah,
the Apple Province.
   He said by the afternoon fighting raged across an eight-mile,
V-shaped front in the disputed province.
   ``The whole front is on fire,'' the spokesman said. He said at
one point artillery shells were falling at the rate of 20 per
minute.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across the region and could
be heard in Sidon, a provincial capital 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Hezbollah said an hour after the shelling started that Amal
fighters, backed by guerrillas of Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat, launched an attack on its positions in the
village of Kfar Milki.
   Police said the fighting left at least 16 combatants dead and 30
wounded.
   Kfar Milki, six miles southeast of Sidon, is a strategic hilltop
village that Hezbollah overran in a major attack across the Apple
Province in January.
   The police spokesman said the PLO guerrillas sealed off the
region west of Kfar Milki, preventing policemen and reporters from
watching the confrontation.
   He said, however, that ambulances evacuated four dead
Palestinian guerrillas and took 23 wounded to hospitals in nearby
Sidon.
   ``The Palestinians are obviously involved in the fighting, but
we can't establish whether they are taking part in ground attacks
or just participating in the shelling duel with Hezbollah
gunners,'' the police spokesman said.
   A force of about 1,000 guerrillas, drawn mainly from Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction, mans a narrow buffer separating Amal and
Hezbollah positions in the disputed region.
   The buffer extends from Kfar Milki at the region's northwestern
edge to the village of Arab Saleem on the southwestern flank.
   The Palestinian deployment blocked Hezbollah's advance west
toward the Mediterranean coast and south toward the main Shiite
cities.
   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said the Amal-Palestinian
attack was crushed. ``The attackers lost many casualties and
withdrew west,'' the statement said without further elaboration.
   The police spokesman, however, said no changes in positions were
reported.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said a Hezbollah source
stressed that its fighters were willing to accept a cease-fire to
allow the Red Cross to evacuate casualties.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for more than
three years for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest
sect in Lebanon. Nearly 1,200 people have died in the clashes and
more than 4,000 have been wounded.
   Amal calls the Hezbollah attacks an ``Iranian invasion,''
charging that the 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards contingent in
Lebanon was involved.
   The command of the Iranian contingent, in a rare statement,
defended its role saying it was aimed only at ``fighting the
Zionists and defending the Moslems.''
   The disputed area is adjacent to the self-designated ``security
zone'' Israel occupies in southern Lebanon.
   The Iranian statement, published by the leftist newspaper
As-Safir, called on Amal and Hezbollah to ``end the fighting among
brethren and unite your guns against the Zionist enemy.''
   The Iranian guards came to Lebanon in 1982 with the declared
objective of taking part in confronting Israel's invading army.
They set up headquarters in the eastern Lebanon town of Baalbek and
have since trained most of Hezbollah's fighters.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A breakaway branch of Solidarity today
formed a new party to rival the faction that backs Lech Walesa.
   The new party, the Citizens Movement for Democratic Action,
includes many heroes of Solidarity's successful struggle against
Communist rule in the 1980s. Its founding congress today drew more
than 1,000 delegates from around the country. Organizers said they
want the party to offer support to Solidarity Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is frequently criticized by Walesa.
   A pro-Walesa party, the Center Alliance, was formed two months
ago.
   Zbigniew Bujak, a Solidarity leader during the years the
movement was banned, acknowledged the formation of the two parties
reflects ``polarization'' within Solidarity. But he said that
``does not have to be bad.''
   ``A democratic country is a country of different proposals. We
will have to forget about the otherwise comfortable structure in
which the picture was black and white ... just us against them,''
he told the new party's members.
   In its first political move, the congress voted nearly
unanimously to endorse a constitutional amendment mandating a
popularly elected president.
   Currently, the president is chosen by the two chambers of
Parliament.
   The new party's members include many of Walesa's longtime
advisers and allies in Solidarity.
   Among them are Adam Michnik, Solidarity theoretician and
editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest daily;
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda; Henryk Wujec, secretary of the Solidarity
parliamentary caucus; Andrzej Wielowieyski, deputy speaker of the
Senate; government ministers Aleksander Hall, Jacek Kuron and
Witold Trzeciakowski; and several deputy ministers.
   Forty-two parliament deputies and senators have joined, along
with up to 5,000 ordinary citizens who signed up nationwide.
   ``We want to build a wide consensus of all those in favor of
democracy. We do not want to be left-wing or right-wing,'' Michnik
told the group. ``We want to get it together in our own new way.''
   The new party and the Center Alliance, loyal to Walesa, clash on
several key points.
   The Center Alliance calls for electing Walesa president by the
current parliament this fall, urges immediate privatization of the
economy and the faster ouster of holdover Communists from positions
of authority.
   It warns that the Mazowiecki government should speed up
political and economic reforms and emphasizes Polish patriotism.
   The new party wants early presidential elections but not by
parliament, arguing that the current chamber is tainted by the 1989
political deal that set aside a portion of seats for Communists.
   It generally supports the policies of the Mazowiecki government,
and says Poland should move closer to Europe and ``overcome
backwardness.''

   A strong earthquake shook northern Japan on
Saturday afternoon, but no damage or casualties were reported,
officials said.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the quake had a
preliminary reading of 5.7 on the Richter scale and was centered 18
miles under the seabed off Fukushima Prefecture (state), 150 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
   Local police officials said there were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties from the undersea quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded by
seismographs. Every increase of one means a tenfold increase in
magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered
``very strong, a 6 ``severe,' capable of widespread damage near the
epicenter.

<TEXT>
   Every morning, Natividad Hancco
Ccama walks half an hour across brown sand to fill two buckets with
dirty water.
   Mrs. Hancco steps carefully as she returns to her thatch house
on a barren hill. The daily ration of two buckets is all the water
she and her two small children have for drinking, cooking and
bathing.
   ``We live worse than animals,'' she said, holding her son's
scab-covered hand. ``Sometimes I cry all day from anger.''
   Until early this year, trucks brought water to Mrs. Hancco's
house in a shantytown outside Lima. Now, with Peru suffering its
worst drought of the century, the trucks are delivering water to
richer neighborhoods that have gone dry.
   Most of Lima's 7 million people are affected. Even upper-class
neighborhoods go entire days without water.
   Clothing, dishes and food cannot be washed. Toilets are not
flushed. Bathtubs are covered in dust.
   The poor suffer most.
   ``People are dying out here,'' said Dr. Rafael Medina, one of
three doctors who care for the 22,000 people living in or near Cruz
de Motupe.
   Like the rest of the shantytown's dusty buildings, Medina's
clinic has no electricity or telephone. Slogans scrawled in red
paint by members of the Maoist guerrilla group Shining Path cover
its cinder block walls.
   ``These people don't even have enough fuel to boil the water,
and the water is filthy,'' Medina said.
   Intestinal disease has risen 52 percent this year in Cruz de
Motupe, and similar increases had been recorded in Lima's many
other shantytowns, according to Camelia Pflacker, a Health Ministry
official.
   Peru already has one of the world's worst rates of infant
mortality _ 81 per 1,000 _ mostly due to intestinal disease.
   Thousands of poor people recently marched through downtown Lima
to demand water.
   ``Water is a right and not a privilege,'' many of their banners
said.
   The government says there is little it can do.
   Lima is in the middle of a desert, and rain is rare. Most of the
city's water comes from the Rimac River, which is fed by mountain
streams, and a drought in the southern Andes has left the streams
nearly dry.
   According to the Meteorological Service, the drought is caused
by a change in the winds that usually bring moist sea air to the
mountains.
   Decades of neglect of Peru's infrastructure make the situation
worse. Not only has the water supply been cut in half, the city
water company said, but 48 percent of that seeps into the ground or
spills into the ocean through broken pipes.
   Other other basic services also have collapsed because of the
drought.
   Lima's power comes from five hydroelectric plants. It is being
rationed, and the daily outages in turn affect the water company's
ability to move water and operate wells.
   Reservoirs built to run the hydroelectric plants during the dry
season now supply much of the capital's water.
   An emergency well-digging program has helped, but ground water
levels are dropping rapidly.
   The water company says many wells will go dry within a few
months, and the power company says its reservoirs hold only enough
water to operate its plants until the next rainy season, in
November.
   Peru is poorly prepared to deal with the drought's effects. It
is in the grips of its worst economic crisis, inflation exceeds
3,000 percent a year, four of five people lack steady work and the
government is bankrupt.
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori issued a plea for emergency
food aid even before taking office Saturday.
   For now, a few hundred water trucks must serve Lima's thirsty
millions.
   ``It's not an easy job,'' said Santiago Guttierez, who is in
charge of 100 trucks. ``We have 250,000 more people to bring water
to than last year.''
   He pointed at a 30-year-old Ford, its tank leaking from at least
20 holes, and added: ``And we don't have the best equipment.''
   Many residents of Cruz de Motupe complain about the men who
drive the trucks.
   They say the price is 35 cents for 20 gallons of water, but the
drivers often charge more. The same amount of water delivered by
pipe to an upper-class home costs a fraction of a cent.
   ``We have no choice but to pay,'' said Rosalia Diez, who is 29
and has four children. ``At least my husband has a job. Some people
just can't afford the water. It's really terrible.''
   Yellow and red flowers bloom in front of the Diez shack,
nourished by the family dishwater.
   Nelly Gonzalez lives where the water trucks rarely go. The
plants in front of her house are dead. She has seven children. Her
husband makes shoes.
   ``To have money and not to have water for the babies . ... It's
absurd. It's tragic. I hope the rains come soon, because if they
don't, I think it means we're not supposed to live.''

   The July 16 earthquake has silenced
President Corazon Aquino's opponents temporarily, but sets the
stage for deeper crises if her government is not effective in
handling the recovery.
   The quake, which killed more than 1,600 people, also may affect
the outcome of talks on the future of the six U.S. military bases
in the Philippines. The government relied heavily on U.S. resources
in the first critical hours.
   ``Some governments have turned disasters like this to their
advantage,'' a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   ``This could be an opportunity for them to show they're a
functioning government, but it easily could turn into a real mess.''
   Because of the earthquake, Mrs. Aquino appears to have gained a
respite from political problems in Congress and challenges both
from Marxist insurgents and military dissidents responsible for six
coup attempts.
   Before the temblor, the executive and legislative branches were
heading for a collision over her establishment of a new political
movement, Kabisig, aimed at bypassing political parties.
   Congress set aside those differences and quickly approved
administration requests for $440,000 in emergency funds. In turn,
the Aquino administration accepted congressional demands that debt
relief be sought from foreign creditors.
   Temporary unilateral truces were announced by the communist New
People's Army and the dissident Reform the Armed Forces Movement.
   Relief operations appear to have improved, but serious problems
persist two weeks after the quake.
   Many foreign relief shipments were tied up in customs awaiting
clearance and payment of duty. Reporters who visited affected areas
said local officials delayed deliveries by repacking relief
supplies in order to take credit for them.
   Under the best of conditions, the Philippines faces a massive
recovery that, by some estimates, could take more than a decade.
   Bridges on major transport arteries collapsed. More than 80,000
buildings were damaged or destroyed. More than 110,000 people were
left homeless.
   Officials of the Public Works Department says the commercial
district of Dagupan, a city of more than 100,000, needs to be
relocated because it sank by about nine feet.
   The emergency dramatized all theadministrative weaknesses for
which Mrs. Aquino has been criticized since taking office in the
1986 ``people power revolution'' that ousted the late President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Filipino and foreign analysts question the government's ability
to manage recovery and curb public discontent if the deficiencies
are not corrected.
   Government rescuers did not reach some devastated areas of Nueva
Vizcaya province until four days after the quake. Local officials
found themselves trying to cope with a major disaster without
cranes, medicine, transport or trained medics.
   It was the private sector, not the government, that responded
best immediately after the quake. Commercial radio stations alerted
rescuers to areas of greatest need.
   Cadets of the Philippine Military Academy carried out the first
rescue operations in Baguio, where nearly 400 people were killed.
The cadets were helped by gold miners who heard radio reports of
the devastation and walked miles over steep mountains to volunteer.
   Diplomatic sources said the government was slow in requesting
foreign help. A U.S. rescue team was in the air from Andrews Air
Force Base before a formal request for assistance was received.
   Richard Gordon, mayor of Olongapo and a Red Cross official,
approached the U.S. Navy at Subic Bay for help. Gordon used a
commercial radio station to coordinate aid with the mayor of
Cabanatuan, where a school collapsed, killing more than 130 people.
   Delays in asking for American help led to the suspicion that
officials feared an active U.S. role would pressure the government
into extending the bases beyond the lease expiration in September
1991. Talks on a new agreement resume next month.
   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila
and the nation's most prominent cleric, alluded to that in the
comment:
   ``How can we forget the shortsightedness of ... officials who
tried to stop the Americans from doing their humanitarian work
because they were afraid the Americans' assistance would be tied up
with the bases issue?''
   Administration officials played down the U.S. contribution after
the quake, and none attended the memorial for an American pilot
killed when his aircraft crashed during relief operations.
   U.S. and Philippine officials say the aid was not tied to the
bases issue, but it seems clear the American response will affect
the talks.
   For weeks, American soldiers had been restricted to their bases
for fear of attacks by communist rebels. After the quake, U.S.
military convoys drove through rebel-controlled territory at night
to reach affected areas.
   American aid also underscored the Philippines' reliance on the
bases during natural disasters. The Americans have the cranes,
helicopters, search craft and other resources otherwise unavailable
to a poor country.
   ``The extensive and highly visible American aid makes a new
treaty for the U.S. bases a surer thing than ever before,''
columnist Antonio Abaya wrote in The Manila Chronicle.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says 24 Parliamentarians Worked for Hated Secret Police</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with second newspaper carrying a
similar report, party official denying both. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 20 members of Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere's party in Parliament once worked for the hated and
now-disbanded secret police, two newspapers reported today.
   A top party official said the reports were inaccurate.
   The East Berlin newspaper Der Morgen said 24 members of the
Christian Democratic Union faction in the parliament had formerly
worked for the Ministry of State Security, known in German as Stasi.
   The ministry, which spied on all aspects of life in East
Germany, was disbanded after East Germany's Communist regime fell.
Since then, many people have been accused of having worked in some
capacity for the Stasi.
   The newspaper did not name the 24 Christian Democratic Union
members in question. It said they received a letter from the
faction chairman, Guenther Krause, in which he asked them not to
take on any ``important political mandate'' in a future all-German
Parliament.
   A respected Munich-based newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitung,
carried a similar report today. It didn't name the accused party
members either.
   East Germany's Christian Democrats are the largest party in a
coalition government. The Christian Democrats govern in West
Germany, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The parties plan to merge
before all-German elections in December and the unified party is
expected to do well in the balloting.
   Der Morgen said the letter followed background checks on all
parliamentarians for possible Stasi connections. The Christian
Democrats have not commented on the reported reproach, but many
high-ranking party leaders confirmed the existence of the Krause
letter, the newspaper said.
   Krause said the claims were not true.
   He said there was ``no cause'' for such a letter and added that
the reports may have been based on a ``misunderstanding,'' prompted
by another letter to faction members for unrelated talks.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of an American Airlines jet
carrying 127 passengers was forced to take evasive action to avoid
a student pilot's plane heading into its flight path, authorities
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the
incident, which occurred at about 11:45 a.m. Thursday shortly after
the MD-80 took off from the Long Beach Airport for Dallas. There
were no injuries.
   In a report to the FAA, American Airlines pilot T.R. Pollizi
said the single-engine Cessna came within 400 feet of his jetliner.
Airline officials said Pollizi was forced to level off his plane to
avoid a collision.
   Flight 216 continued on to Dallas, said airline spokesman Tim
Smith.
   A student pilot flying the Cessna was practicing takeoffs and
landings when the incident occurred, said FAA spokeswoman Elly
Brekke. She declined to identify the pilot.
   Brekke said a preliminary investigation ruled out error by air
traffic controllers.
   Pollizi reported that moments after takeoff he saw the Cessna
about a mile to his left and 200 feet above his altitude. The
Cessna passed within 400 feet to the left and 100 feet above his
jet as he leveled at 700 feet, Pollizi reported.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't long after Theodore Roosevelt named
Oliver Wendell Holmes to the Supreme Court that he wished he hadn't.
   Holmes cast an important vote against Roosevelt's trustbusting
efforts.
   ``I could carve out of a banana a judge with more backbone,''
sputtered Roosevelt.
   Maybe it is an omen that David H. Souter, the appeals court
judge from New Hampshire selected last week by President Bush for
the Supreme Court, is said to emulate the values and philosophy of
Holmes.
   At Harvard, his senior thesis was on Holmes' judicial
philosophy. Souter still follows a course of reading laid out by
his fellow New Englander.
   Over the years, Supreme Court justices have shown an independent
streak unforeseen by their presidential appointers.
   The truth is that presidents can nominate justices, but can't
dominate them. Once on the bench, jurists sometimes cause dismay
for their sponsors.
   Dwight Eisenhower regretted that he'd named two justices who
became liberal activists, Earl Warren and William J. Brennan. After
leaving office, Ike was asked if he had made any substantial
mistakes. Yes, he is supposed to have said, two _ ``and they are
both sitting on the Supreme Court.''
   How was he to know when he appointed Warren that his chief
justice would lead the court into overthrowing segregation in
public schools _ an earthquake of a decision and one that
Eisenhower never gave any sign of being happy about?
   Nor could Ike have foreseen Brennan's forceful liberal impact.
Brennan had been an obscure member of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Eisenhower picked him because his first choice, the chief justice
of that court, was too ill and recommended Brennan instead.
   ``Nobody knows how a judge is likely to turn out until the judge
actually sits on a bench,'' said Bernard Schwartz, a law professor
at New York University and author of a new book about the Warren
Burger court, ``The Ascent of Pragmatism.''
   His best example of a justice who surprised his sponsor is Felix
Frankfurter.
   Frankfurter, he said, was ``so radical he was almost considered
a red'' when Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him.
   Once in robes, Frankfurter became a leader of the judicial
restraint camp. One of the nation's leading civil libertarian
lawyers turned into a thorn to libertarian causes.
   Of the eight justices on today's Supreme Court, four _ Byron
White, Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor _
turned out different than expected, some more than others.
   Of the four, Blackmun's the shocker.
   President Richard Nixon had been humiliated by the Senate, which
rejected his first two nominees _ both conservative southerners _
on ethical grounds. So he chose Blackmun, a little-known appeals
court justice.
   Blackmun was a lifelong friend of Nixon's ideologically
predictable chief justice, the solidly conservative Warren E.
Burger. Both were Minnesotans.
   For a time they marched in judicial lockstep; wags called them
``the Minnesota twins.''
   But the liberal Brennan took Blackmun under his tutelage, and
Blackmun evolved into a more-often-than-not liberal. He wrote the
Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion, and once said with a
sigh he supposed that was what they'd put on his gravestone.
   White was nominated by President John F. Kennedy, his close
friend. ``He pretty much has been a New Frontiersman on civil
rights,'' said Schwartz, ``but on other issues he has trended away
from the persuasion that got him his appointment.''
   Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Georgetown University,
dissented. ``If we could ask John Kennedy whether Byron White has
worked out as he expected, I would guess the answer would be yes,''
Tushnet said.
   Stevens was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford to take the
seat of the foremost liberal, William O. Douglas, whom Ford, as a
congressman, had tried to have impeached. Stevens, a court
maverick, has evolved into sharing the court's middle-to-liberal
ground with Blackmun.
   O'Connor is in the middle-to-conservative bloc with White. She
turned out to be much more of a centrist than Reagan's three other
choices _ William Rehnquist, whom he elevated to chief justice, and
Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy.
   Tushnet thinks justices surprise their nominating presidents
``only occasionally.'' But Lawrence Marshall, who teaches
constitutional law at Northwestern University, said that in the
past two or three decades ``a good third of appointees have
disappointed their appointers with respect to major issues.''
   Marshall has a theory: ``Presidents get surprised when they pick
nominees on non-ideological grounds. ...
   ``When their agenda is ideology _ as it was when Reagan picked
Scalia and Rehnquist _ I think the surprises are a lot less
frequent,'' he said.
   He cites O'Connor and Warren as examples. Reagan chose O'Connor
not for her ideology but because he had promised in his campaign to
pick a woman. Eisenhower promised to name Warren to the court at
the Republican convention in 1952, where Warren, then governor of
California, was competing with him for the presidential nomination.
   ``There was something else going on other than an attempt by the
president to choose ideologically,'' said Marshall.
   What does that say about Souter's likelihood to surprise?
   Marshall's hunch is that Bush deliberately did not scrutinize
Souter on ideological grounds, opting for an unknown quantity _ and
getting a nominee who, on the court, is capable of surprises.

<HEAD>Iraqi President's Words _ And Threats _ Influenced OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although not sitting at the bargaining table,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wielded enormous influence over
OPEC's decision to limit oil production and set its target price
sharply higher.
   Indeed, some believe it will be Saddam _ and not OPEC _ who will
make sure no one cheats on the new accord and forces prices down
again.
   ``He'll be breathing down their neck,'' said Nauman Barakat,
first vice president in the energy department at Shearson Lehman
Hutton in New York.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, denied his
country would play the role of enforcer.
   ``I have no police uniform,'' he told reporters after Friday's
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Later in an interview, he said, ``We're not considering
ourselves as a policeman nor as a watchdog.''
   But Saddam's strong words _ and even military threats _ against
countries pumping too much oil did not go unnoticed.
   Midway through the meeting, one minister said the conflict in
the volatile Persian Gulf region was not hindering work.
   ``On the contrary, it has created a new atmosphere of
willingness to work together,'' said the official, demanding
anonymity.
   ``People know now that deterioration within OPEC causes great
harm to some countries,'' he said. ``It's a serious matter.''
   Another ministerial source, also demanding anonymity, said,
``From now on, every country must understand that any unilateral
action to lower prices could affect the economic interests of the
others.''
   At the end of two days of bargaining, all 13 ministers signed an
accord limiting their output to 22.5 million barrels a day for the
rest of the year.
   Their current output is estimated at about 23 million barrels a
day, although it was much higher earlier in the year.
   The ministers, for the first time since December 1986, raised
their target price, pushing it up $3 to $21 a barrel.
   If, unlike in the past, the cartel curtails output, crude prices
could rise several dollars a barrel by year's end, analysts said.
Gasoline prices at the pump could go up as much as a dime a gallon.
   Saddam's blast of rhetoric was aimed squarely at Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, chronic and open violators of their OPEC
supply quotas.
   He blamed them for flooding the market with oil and depressing
crude prices, causing a $14 billion loss in revenue for Iraq, which
is trying to rebuild from its costly eight-year war with Iran.
   Chalabi said in the interview that the price decline _ OPEC's
marker tumbled from $20.46 in January to $13.64 in June _ amounted
to an ``oil shock for the producers.''
   ``We had to put an end to it,'' he said. ``We cannot just let
anybody do whatever they like ... We had to defend ourselves and
defend the interests of OPEC.''
   Chalabi acknowledged that ``unfortunately ... we had to be a
little bit hard on others.''
   In doing so, Iraq appeared to have nailed down pledges from
Kuwait and the U.A.E. to scale back output by hundreds of thousands
of barrels a day.
   ``We are all sure and confident that it is now the policy of the
governments of Kuwait and the U.A.E. to fully abide by the contents
of the agreement,'' said Chalabi.
   Kuwait, which has been pumping more than its supply quota of 1.5
million barrels a day, had argued lower prices would help the
cartel hold on to its share of the world oil market.
   The U.A.E., which has produced more than double its old quota of
1.1 million barrels a day, just accepted a cap of 1.5 million, said
another oil minister, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``All those factors are somehow linked to the political problems
in the gulf,'' he said.
   But the Iraqi president's more bellicose words were frightening
_ and unwelcome.
   ``All the delegations were really worried about the outcome of
this meeting,'' said one minister.
   There was concern, he said, that an outbreak of trouble in the
strategic oil-producing gulf region would lead to an oil shock,
sending crude prices soaring wildly.
   ``At the beginning,'' he said, ``it was a very tense meeting.''
   But he said there was never any mention of the confrontation in
the formal sessions, although there was some discussion in the
corridors.
   Even so, it appears the political actions were instrumental in
helping solve some of the cartel's economic problems.
   ``The events that have taken place within the last few weeks had
their impact _ for sure,'' Chalabi said.

<HEAD>Liberian Struggle Marks Latest in Long Series of Tribal Conflicts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This West African city was once a
lively capital, a buzzing hive of business activity. Lebanese and
Indian traders mixed with American and European technicians in its
once-bustling streets.
   Now those streets are deserted by civilians _ and are the
battlegrounds of rebels and government troops.
   Crocodile-infested mangrove swamps have always limited access to
Monrovia, which is home to half a million people _ one-fifth of
Liberia's population.
   Now the swamps are an ally of embattled President Samuel Doe as
he struggles to hold off the rebels besieging his capital.
   The insurgents made consistent headway for seven months and
closed in on Monrovia several weeks ago. However _ contrary to
predictions of Western governments who expected his speedy fall _
Doe has held on, holed up in a beachfront fortress.
   But the civil war, accompanied by bloody tribal conflict, is a
bitter irony in a nation whose very existence was meant to be a
celebration of freedom.
   Liberia was founded in 1847 as black Africa's first independent
republic, created by freed American slaves who were brought back to
the coast of West Africa by humanitarian societies.
   But the newcomers were cut off from their African roots by
generations of slavery, and had no region or tribe would recognize
them.
   Even Liberia's state motto _ ``The love of liberty brought us
here'' _ refers to the freed slaves and their descendants, and
ignores the very existence of 90 percent of its population.
   With the arrival of the ``Americo-Liberians,'' a deal was struck
with local chiefs for land where they could settle. The newcomers
dominated the new nation, while the African tribes living in the
interior were virtually forgotten in their own homeland.
   Over the years, the social, cultural and economic gap between
the local tribes and the American-Liberians widened. The
descendants of the freed slaves formed all-powerful masonic groups
nd monopolized political power.
   In 1980, however, a group of non-commissioned officers from the
remote inland Krahn tribe staged a coup. They killed President
William R. Tolbert and for the first time established a government
of Liberians without any American links.
   Master Sgt. Doe, leader of the tribal rebellion, was initially
hailed as a liberator. But he ruled his country like a tribal
chief: members of his Krahn tribe, and their allies, the Mandingos,
were given special advantages.
   On several occasions, opponents _ usually traditional tribal
enemies _ tried to overthrow Doe. Hundreds were killed.
   Charles Taylor, descendant of Americo-Liberians and Africans,
launched an invasion from neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, 1989.
   Taylor, as head of the Liberian government's general service
office, had been accused of absconding with $900,000 in government
money.
   Doe's acting information minister, Paul Allen Wie, remained
defiant in the face of rebel gains.
   ``As long as the capital and the head of the nation have not
been captured, Taylor has not won the war,'' Wie said.
   Doe may have been helped by the fact that the rebels are not
united.
   While Taylor's forces were blocked on the eastern outskirts of
the capital, a rival rebel leader, Prince Johnson, fought his way
into the city.
   Johnson is the son of a Gio hunter and a former army lieutenant,
but little is known about him. But he has quarreled with Taylor,
who has reportedly threatened to kill him.
   So even as the rebels fight to topple Doe, the Taylor-Johnson
rivalry sets the stage for another clash between Americo-Liberians
and African peoples.

   Two employees of major defense
contractors are to serve six months in a halfway house and pay
$5,000 fines for conspiring to trade in sensitive Pentagon reports
on long-range weapons plans.
   The sentencings in U.S. District Court on Friday closed out the
criminal cases arising from Operation Undercover, an investigation
into the network of corporate workers who traded in secret Pentagon
reports for more than a decade.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. sentenced Frank J. Caso,
58, and John R. Kiely, 65, to two years imprisonment, but suspended
all but six months. Caso was a marketing analyst with Hughes
Aircraft Co. and Kiely was a former marketing manager with Raytheon
Co.
   They were convicted last month following the 15-month government
investigation into the use of Defense Department secrets by
contractors.
   Prosecutors say the companies sought the long-range military
budget proposals for each of the military branches to gain an edge
in seeking contracts for huge Pentagon weapons.
   Michael J. Costello of the Defense Criminal Investigative
Service, which handled the investigation, said circulation of the
documents may have cost taxpayers millions of dollars by tainting
the procurement process.
   Six people have been sentenced in the cases and fines of $14.9
million were levied against five corporations, including Hughes, a
subsidiary of General Motors and Raytheon.
   The longest sentence in the investigation was a two-year jail
term given Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeing marketing analyst
convicted of 39 criminal counts arising from documents he illegally
obtained, copied, distributed and destroyed.

<TEXT>
   Fire and heavy rains on Saturday
forced rescuers to suspend their search for survivors in a
collapsed hotel where two people were earlier saved more than a
week after an earthquake left 1,600 dead.
   Rescuers said they found the pair Friday after following a
housefly buzzing in the ruins of the Hyatt Hotel.
   Rescuers and spectators cheered as Luisa Mallorca, a 20-year-old
cleaning woman, and Arnel Calabia, a 26-year-old security guard,
were pulled from the debris.
   Calabia's father, Dominador, said he had lost hope of ever
seeing his son alive again.
   ``We did not expect that he could be recovered alive 11 days
after the earthquake,'' Dominador Calabia told reporters in Manila.
``I felt unimaginable happiness as a father to hear that my son was
alive.''
   Doctors said Calabia and Miss Mallorca suffered from dehydration
and other injuries but were in suprisingly good condition after
their ordeal.
   They were to be flown to Manila, 130 miles to the south, as soon
as the weather cleared in Baguio after torrential monsoon rains.
   Miners worked through the rains Saturday to try to find more
survivors, but were forced to halt their efforts after a fire,
touched off by acetylene torches used in the search, spread through
the ruins.
   More than 20 people are still believed buried beneath the
debris. The U.S. Embassy said 12 Americans, all of Filipino origin,
were believed among the missing there.
   Foreign rescue teams gave up searching last week, convinced no
survivors would be found. The Hyatt was one of eight hotels which
collapsed in the July 16 quake.
   Local miners and other volunteers vowed to keep looking until
all the missing were accounted for.
   Calabia said he, Miss Mallorca and a male employee were on the
third floor near the elevator when the quake struck. All three
dived under tables ``and then the ceiling fell in,'' he said in a
radio interview.
   ``We recovered consciousness later and we called out to each
other,'' Calabia said.
   The three lay in the dark, talked to each other and prayed,
Calabia and Miss Mallorca said. The other man, William Tan, was
badly hurt and died about surviving almost a week under the rubble.
   Doctors at Baguio General Hospital said Calabia and Miss
Mallorca both suffered cuts, bruises and severe dehydration.
Calabia told reporters his right hand was injured and nurses told
him three fingers might have to be amputated.
   Baguio, a mountain resort about a mile above sea level, was one
of the cities hardest hit. Nearly 400 people died in the town.
   According to the latest figures, the earthquake left at least
1,653 people dead, 1,000 missing and presumed dead, 3,000 seriously
injured and 110,000 homeless.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A group of black Moslems who
kidnapped the prime minister and some Cabinet members in a coup
attempt said today the captives may be harmed if the government
moves against a rebel-held TV station.
   One report said three people were killed in the first hours of
the rebel strike, which began Friday on the former British colony
of two islands that lie off the Venezuelan coast.
   ``The government has been overthrown,'' the coup leader, Abu
Bakr, said on government TV Friday evening after the station was
seized by his followers.
   But government radio said today that a state of emergency had
been declared and that police were moving into the streets of the
capital of this southern Caribbean nation to restore order.
   Gunfire was heard in the direction of the television station,
located in northeastern Port-of-Spain about two miles from the
Parliament building and the main police station. Buildings also
were burning in eastern Port-of-Spain.
   Education Minister Clive Pantin said on government radio that he
had not been captured by the rebels and that the mutineers had
already released two unidentified ministers and four civilians they
had been holding.
   The Barbados-based Caribbean News Agency, or CANA, said three
people had been killed as the coup attempt began with an explosion
at the police station and rebels bursting into Parliament firing
weapons.
   It said a news reporter had seen the body of a woman Parliament
worker in the Parliament building, and it quoted witnesses as
saying they saw two bodies in front of the building.
   In Washington, a State Department official said it appeared
``the active elements of the insurrection are limited to the
television station and the parliament building.''
   ``We understand there has been some looting'' in the streets,
``but nothing affecting the safety of our embassy or foreign
nationals,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Trinidad's island of Tobago is a popular vacation site
for Americans and others.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush and National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen. She said the U.S.
government had not yet received a request for international aid,
but would consider it once it arrives.
   Bakr, a former policeman who heads a group called Jamaat
al-Muslimeen, Arabic for the Moslem Group, has said he doesn't
recognize ``man's law,'' only ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   The Moslem group is known to have connections to Libya that are
said to include some funding. News reports say Abu Bakr has visited
Libya.
   Bakr's group has an estimated 250 followers. The mostly Hindu
and Roman Catholic country of 1.3 million people has a 1,500-member
army and a 5,000-member police force.
   The State Department said earlier that the United States would
``deplore any attempt to overthrow the democratic government of
Trinidad.''
   Prime Minister Arthur Robinson's National Alliance for
Reconstruction won parliamentary elections in December 1986. The
next elections are due in 1991.
   British West Indies Airways and American Airlines canceled
commercial flights into Trinidad on Friday evening. Piarco
International Airport remained under control of government security
forces but was closed early today.
   When Bakr broadcast his claim of a takeover, he did not disclose
the whereabouts of Robinson and the other captured officials. It
was not known how many Cabinet ministers were taken hostage with
Robinson, 63, a veteran political leader, lawyer and economist.
   But the news director at the captured government television
station went on the air this morning and said the prime minister
and the other officials were alive and being ``well treated.''
   The news director, Jones Madeira, said some of the officials
were being held at the TV station and others at the Parliament
building, Red House.
   But he warned that the television station's signals were being
tampered with and ``this could endanger the lives of those people
being held.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Anthony Pantin told government radio
he had spoken to Madeira by telephone.
   ``He asked me to emphasize the request not to interfere with the
television channels, because if they do something may happen,'' the
prelate said.
   Several government ministers were seen on the rebel-controlled
television. Government radio, the National Broadcasting Service's
Radio 610, said the capital's police station was blown up and
burned out of control for hours.
   It said no one attempted to put out the fire, and there were
several explosions of what was assumed to be ammunition in the
station.
   Bakr first appeared on television at 6 p.m. Friday to announce
the uprising. He said his followers planned no violence, looting or
retribution against civilians, and promised ``free and fair''
elections within 90 days.
   Government radio said before dawn today that there had been some
looting and police had moved into the streets.
   Bakr, in his mid-40s, has been arrested several times in the
past on charges of contempt of court and illegal demonstrations.
   He lives with 200 to 250 followers, their wives and children in
a commune on the western side of Port-of-Spain. Members of the
sect, founded in 1980, are widely perceived in Trinidad as violent
outlaws, though the group's rhetoric is highly moralistic.
   In 1988, police raided the commune, seizing weapons and
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of
larceny, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, rape and murder.
Bakr said then his vigilantes were waging a war against ``the
menace of cocaine.''
   ``We will stop the incest, robbery, and drugs which there was no
hope for the present regime to stop,'' he said in Friday's
broadcast.
   The rebel group in the past year has been occupying some
government land in western Port-of-Spain. Recently, the government
had denied customs approval of a shipment of medical supplies
donated to Bakr by Libya.

<HEAD>Charges of Communist Plot Throw Shadows on Black-White Talks</HEAD>

   Government charges of a
Communist plot to seize power have cast a shadow over talks on
ending white-minority rule and put pressure on the African National
Congress' alliance with the Communists.
   The police claim to have uncovered evidence of a conspiracy by
the South African Communist Party and elements of the ANC's
military wing to seize power if talks on ending white rule fail.
   Newspapers, citing security sources, reported Saturday that the
Communist Party has been working on plans to smuggle large
quantities of arms into the country and establish guerrilla units.
   Police say they have found a number of arms dumps and have
arrested some 40 militants, though no one has been charged.
   The allegations have created confusion, with the government
trading accusations and denials with the ANC and the closely allied
Communist Party.
   Police have not publicly presented evidence of their conspiracy
claims, and some anti-apartheid activists believe the security
forces are attempting to undermine black-white negotiations.
   Leaders on both sides are concerned the dispute could threaten
efforts by the government and the ANC to clear the way for
full-scale talks on sharing political power with the black majority.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela are
scheduled to meet Aug. 6 to try to clear remaining obstacles to the
talks, including ANC demands for the release of jailed militants.
   The government wants an end to the ANC's ineffective armed
struggle and a cease-fire.
   De Klerk and other senior government leaders reportedly see the
Communists as a major threat and want Communist leader Joe Slovo
dropped from the ANC delegation to the talks.
   Police say the top ANC leadership is being duped by the
Communists. Slovo is one of several Communist leaders who also hold
top posts in the ANC.
   Local news reports say police findings include records of
remarks by Slovo asserting that the Communists are not bound by a
commitment signed by the ANC and the government in May to halt
political violence.
   Slovo and other Communists were part of the ANC negotiating team
in those talks.
   Mandela indignantly denies there is any plot to seize power. De
Klerk presented him with details of police findings in a private
meeting Thursday, but Mandela said he was not convinced.
   ``There is no plot as far as we're concerned,'' Mandela said.
   The dispute between the government and the ANC has refocused
attention on the Communist Party and its plans and intentions.
   Slovo, the party's secretary-general, says the Communists are
committed to democracy. He says the party will become the voice of
the working class in a post-apartheid South Africa.
   The former lawyer insists the party has turned its back on its
hard-line Marxist past and will seek power peacefully. The party
derides claims that it seeks to impose authoritarian rule.
   Despite criticisms, the ANC has stood by its long alliance with
the Communists. Mandela says he will work with anyone to end
apartheid, and the Communists have long played a prominent role in
that struggle.
   The Communist Party keeps details of its leadership and
membership secret, making it difficult to assess its strength. It
is thought to number just a few hundred militants, but many occupy
leadership posts in the ANC, trade unions and other political
groups.

   The second tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season formed today off the Florida coast with sustained winds near
50 mph, meteorologists said.
   Tropical Storm Bertha was nearly stationary early today, but the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables predicted it
would drift northward. Conditions also were favorable that it will
pick up in strength by Sunday, the center reported.
   At noon EDT today, Bertha was located about 280 miles east of
Cape Canaveral, near latitude 28.7 north and longitude 75.6 west.
Maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph.
   On Friday, forecasters stopped issuing advisories concerning the
remains of Tropical Storm Arthur as the system was reduced to a
tropical wave.
   Arthur's sustained winds dropped from 70 mph to 35 mph Thursday,
briefly building to 40 mph again, and then dropped below 39 mph for
good. That's the minimum wind speed for a tropical disturbance to
be defined as a tropical storm.
   Storm watches for the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and the
island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
were lifted by Thursday afternoon.
   There were reports of heavy rain, but no serious damage and
injuries on the islands.
   Arthur, the hurricane season's first named storm, began forming
Sunday in the open Atlantic. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Where else would dozens of drivers
rendezvous in a cross-country rally for Britain's classic Morgan
sports cars?
   More than 50 Morgans from the United States, Canada and Europe
are expected in this northern West Virginia town Monday when
drivers who left San Francisco July 11 join other Morgan
enthusiasts for a two-week tour of the Northeast.
   ``This whole thing came about from a fantasy I've had since I
was 6 years old,'' said 45-year-old Jeremy Harrison, a podiatrist
from Liverpool, England, who organized the event. ``I've wanted to
drive through a hole cut in a redwood tree since I saw a photograph
of a car doing it. Now I've done it.''
   He calls the rally ``Morgans Over America.''
   Harrison's Morgan convoy rolled into Chicago on Friday. The
itinerary calls for the cars, including two three-wheeled models
built in 1933, to pass through Detroit and Ohio before arriving at
Morgantown, about 75 miles south of Pittsburgh, Monday afternoon.
   Meanwhile, rally drivers from the East are gathering, with many
planning to meet in Luray, Va., travel to North Carolina to link up
with Atlanta area Morgan owners, and then head to Morgantown,
according to Mark Braunstein, who arranged the rally's eastern leg.
   ``Morgantown just happened to be the right spot on the map for
us to meet,'' said Braunstein. ``It's on the route and its name
clinched it.''
   Twenty-one Morgans, including cars from Germany, Sweden, Denmark
and Scotland, were shipped to the United States for the rally,
Harrison said.
   ``I had a terrible time with insurance,'' said Harrison, whose
1990 lilac Morgan Plus Eight is worth about $50,000. ``We had more
than 200 refusals until an agent in Pennsylvania agreed to insure
us for five weeks on the road and shipping for $13,000.''
   Founded in 1909 in Malvern Link, England, the Morgan Motor Co.
is the world's oldest privately owned automobile manufacturer. The
company began fashioning handcrafted, wood-framed, open sports cars
in 1936 after building its reputation on sports cycles and
three-wheelers.
   The Morgan's long-louvered hood, leather interior, wooden dash
and wind-grabbing shape have seen only minor alterations during the
last 50 years. Mechanical changes, except for engine swaps, have
also been slow in coming.
   ``There's still a button to push to lubricate the front
suspension,'' Harrison said. ``That's been around since 1911.''
   List prices for Morgans range between $23,000 and $38,000,
depending on the model. An extensive list of options _ including a
Rover V-8 engine _ can push the price much higher, Harrison said.
   Added to that cost is the wait: Only nine cars a week are built
by the Morgan factory's 120 employees, so the waiting list for the
cars is eight years, company officials said earlier this year.
   ``Customers are encouraged to observe their car being built,''
Harrison said. ``I asked to have mine painted on a Saturday so I
could watch it being done.''
   Mechanical problems, speeding tickets and rain have plagued the
drivers on the trip's western leg, Harrison said during a rest stop
in La Crosse, Wis.
   ``We've already had three speeding tickets and three
breakdowns,'' Harrison said during a telephone interview. ``Two
people have paid $90 speeding tickets and another driver was fined
$120 in California.
   ``Morgans are light and have powerful engines,'' he said. ``They
really go.''
   Probably the worst mechanical failure so far, according to
Harrison, occurred when the rear axle of a London man's Morgan
froze up.
   ``He hadn't greased it in 10 years, he didn't know he was
supposed to,'' said Harrison. ``That was stupid.''
   Still, Harrison said: ``Everybody's thrilled.''
   He brought his 21-year-old daughter along for the ride. And his
group includes a mother-daughter team from England and ``a lady who
just wanted to see Yellowstone and another person who wanted to see
your Mount Rushmore.''
   ``It's the trip of a lifetime,'' he said. ``There's already been
some discussion of doing it again in five years.''

<HEAD>Ruling Party Relinquishes Monopoly on Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cape Verde's ruling Marxist party has
relinquished its 15-year monopoly on power and renounced its role
as the leading force in society, Portuguese news reports said
Saturday.
   It was the latest in a series of democratic reforms in Africa's
traditional one-party states.
   The decisions came at a four-day congress this week in the
Atlantic island nation's capital of Praia, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa reported.
   The African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde also
elected Prime Minister Pedro Pires as its party chief, Lusa
reported.
   The about 200 delegates party embraced multiparty democracy and
renounced its constitutionally enshrined role as the ``leading
force of the state and society,'' Lusa said.
   The delegates voted to eliminate their party's
Marxist-influenced system of organization and uphold ``plurality of
opinions,'' Lusa said.
   The party has ruled Cape Verde since the 10-island archipelago,
385 miles off the coast of Senegal, gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   Pires, 56, who was the party's assistant secretary-general, will
replace Cape Verde's president, Aristides Pereira, in the top party
post.
   Pereira said he was leaving the party, which he founded 35 years
ago as an underground force to fight Portuguese rule, to gain
autonomy to prepare the country's transition toward democracy.
   The 66-year-old leader is expected to campaign for another term
as head of state in elections scheduled for November, the first
poll to be based on direct, universal suffrage. New electoral
regulations assert presidential candidates cannot be party-based.
   Constitutional reform scheduled for September is due to legalize
other parties. A new constitution to enshrine pluralist principles
is expected next year.
   The ruling party has announced plans for a multiparty
legislative ballot to follow November's presidential elections.
   A number of opposition groups have emerged recently, and
according to media reports from Praia, walls around the capital
were painted with opposition slogans in the past few days.
   The Movement for Democracy, headed by Carlos Veiga, an
independent deputy in Cape Verde's national assembly, aims to unite
opposition forces to face the ruling party.

   Saudi Arabia on Saturday invited
Iraqi and Kuwaiti leaders to its summer capital to settle a border
and oil dispute that has led to the mobilization of armed forces by
both Baghdad and Kuwait.
   Diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
oil, financial and legal experts from Kuwait and Iraq are expected
to meet separately in the Saudi summer capital of Jiddah to work
out an agreement.
   It was unclear when the meeting would be held.
   The diplomatic sources said Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal Saturday delivered invitations from King Fahd to Kuwaiti
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah and
Iraq's No. 2 official Ezzat Ibrahim for a meeting in Jiddah.
   Last week tensions flared between Iraq and Kuwait as Baghdad
moved 30,000 troops to its border with Kuwait and demanded changes
in that country's oil production. Iraq also demanded compensation
from Kuwait for $2.4 billion worth of oil it said Kuwait pumped
from the disputed Rumailah oil field which straddles the joint
border.
   Diplomatic sources said Saturday the troops remained on the
border.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein triggered the tensions earlier
this month when he accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of
costing his country $14 billion by exceeding their oil production
quotas and driving oil prices down.
   During the crisis Kuwait's army of about 20,000 men briefly went
on alert. Iraq has about 1 million men under arms.
   Faisal's mission was preceded by an official Saudi statement
welcoming a ``bilateral meeting between representatives of Iraq and
Kuwait in Jiddah over the coming few days, God willing, to thrash
out all differences through fraternal and cordial dialogue.''
   It said the Saudi government was ``deeply satisfied with the
response of both Iraq and Kuwait to the goodwill efforts.''
   Iraq has termed the upcoming meeting in Saudi Arabia a protocol
step and has demanded that it is followed by working talks in
Baghdad.
   Some of the Iraqi pressure on Kuwait has seemed to have already
eased after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed to try to reach a target price of $21 per barrel for oil.
The increase was a long-standing Iraqi demand.

<HEAD>Baltics Bow Out of Treaty Gorbachev Calls Vital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Baltic republics said Saturday they won't take
part in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to negotiate a new treaty that
would give the 15 Soviet republics more autonomy from the Kremlin.
   Instead, the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said
they will proceed with joint talks with the Soviet government for
their independence.
   Their decision, reached at a summit Friday night, dealt a sharp
blow to Gorbachev's plans to hold the splintering Soviet Union
together as a looser confederation of sovereign states.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin.
   At a Kremlin meeting July 20, Gorbachev called the union treaty
vital to Soviet government plans to transfer the nation to a market
economy, saying it would ensure a single market-oriented system in
which all components will complement each other.
   Gorbachev has long promised such a revamped treaty providing a
measure of autonomy for the Soviet republics, but some are taking
their own action to sever ties with the central government.
   The Baltic republics have made the boldest moves toward
secession, and on Friday Byelorussia joined the Russian republic,
the Ukraine, Moldavia and Uzbekistan in declaring sovereignty.
Georgia has called for negotiations on independence.
   The Baltic statement _ signed by Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis, Estonia's Arnold Ruutel and Latvia's Anatoly Gorbunov
_ said the three leaders ``consider it impossible'' to participate
in the union treaty.
   ``It would be best if negotiations with the U.S.S.R. were held
on the basis of the three-plus-one principle,'' they said,
referring to their republics plus the Soviet government. The
statement was released Saturday.
   The Baltic republics also said they had no territorial or other
claims on each other, and asked the other 12 republics of the
Soviet Union to come forward within a month with any territorial or
other claims they might have on them.
   The republic of Byelorussia earlier this year made some
territorial claims on parts of Lithuania.
   The Baltic leaders said Friday they had agreed to negotiate
political, economic, legal and cultural treaties with the huge
Russian Federation. Talks must start immediately, they said after
meeting with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin during his vacation
in the Latvian beach resort of Jurmala.
   The press center of the Latvian parliament quoted Yeltsin as
saying the political treaty between Latvia and Russia would
recognize Latvia's independence. Yeltsin was quoted as telling
Latvian television he sees the treaties as agreements between equal
and sovereign states.
   The press center said a Latvian delegation would come to Moscow,
the capital of both Russia and the Soviet Union, on Monday to begin
talks.
   The Baltic republics were part of the Russian Empire, but gained
their independence amid the turmoil of World War I and the
Bolshevik Revolution. They were absorbed by the Soviet Union in
1940.
   Lithuania declared outright on March 11 that it was
re-establishing that independence, and Latvia and Estonia followed
with declarations that they would resume independence after
unspecified transition periods.
   Gorbachev slapped a tough economic embargo on Lithuania on April
18, and on June 29, Lithuania said it would freeze its declaration
in return for an end to the blockade and the start of negotiations
with the Kremlin on secession. Those talks have yet to begin,
although delegations are being formed.

<HEAD>Reports Link Governing Party Members to Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-four members of Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere's party in Parliament once worked for the now-disbanded
secret police, newspapers said Saturday. A key party official
denied the reports.
   The East Berlin newspaper Der Morgen, in reporting on the
alleged connection, said it based its information on a letter sent
to 24 members of the Christian Democratic Union faction in the
Parliament.
   Der Morgen said the 24 received a letter from Guenter Krause,
the party's parliamentary faction chairman, in which he asked them
not to take on any ``important political mandate'' in a future
all-German Parliament.
   The newspaper said the letter followed background checks on all
parliamentarians for possible Stasi connections.
   Der Morgen said several high-ranking party leaders confirmed the
letter's existence. A respected Munich-based newspaper,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung, carried a similar report Saturday.
   Neither newspaper named the 24 parliamentarians in question. The
Christian Democrats won 164 seats in the 400-seat Parliament in
East Germany's first free election on March 18, following a
pro-democracy revolution.
   Krause said the claims were not true. He said there was ``no
cause'' for such a letter and added that the report may have been
based on a ``misunderstanding'' prompted by another letter to
faction members for unrelated talks.
   The former Ministry of State Security, known in German as Stasi,
had a pervasive hold on all aspects of East German life through its
spying. It was disbanded after East Germany's Communist regime
fell, but its coverage was so wide that many people are tainted by
association with it.
   East Germany's Christian Democrats are the largest party but
govern in a coalition. The Christian Democrats govern in West
Germany, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The parties plan to merge
before all-German elections in December, and the unified party is
expected to do well in the balloting.
   Leaders in both Germanys are trying to hammer out an agreement
on how and when the countries will end 45 years of postwar division
and unify. That requires agreement on the technicalities of
electing a united Parliament.
   Last week, de Maiziere's governing coalition almost collapsed in
a dispute over whether to merge before the elections and have
balloting throughout the unified country or to hold elections in
the separate states first, then merge.
   On Friday, the Social Democrats, the second-biggest faction,
agreed to remain in the coalition after de Maiziere apparently
backed down from insisting that East Germany remain a separate
nation until after the Dec. 2 elections.
   The outcome of the dispute will determine the leadership of a
united Germany by deciding how many votes each party needs for
parliamentary representation. To win seats, parties will need to
win more votes in an election for a unified nation than in separate
East and West German balloting.
   West German law requires a minimum 5 percent showing for
parliamentary representation, and the two sides are now trying to
agree on whether the same minimum should apply in elections planned
Dec. 2 that will unify the Germanys.
   One proposal would involve vote-counting separately in each of
the 16 states of a unified Germany. Another suggestion put forward
Saturday would allow smaller parties to appear on the same ballot
as larger ones, thereby increasing their chances for representation.
   That practice is allowed in East German elections, but not for
national elections in West Germany.

   The Louisiana known for boozy Bourbon Street
and the excesses of Mardi Gras has been obscured by a Legislature
burning with bills to ban abortions, label ``bad'' records and
allow a little head-knocking defense of the flag.
   The Legislature's morality quest may have surprised outsiders
who picture Louisiana as free-wheeling and laid back. But naughty
New Orleans notwithstanding, the religious right has a strong
influence on Louisiana politics.
   The apple-pie issues also served as distractions from the
state's fiscal woes.
   Lawmakers passed a strict anti-abortion bill that allowed no
exceptions for rape or incest victims, even though Gov. Buddy
Roemer warned them he'd veto it.
   They almost passed a measure that would have eliminated jail
terms for people convicted of roughing up flag burners. Later, they
gutted that bill and hurriedly substituted anti-abortion language
to skip procedural delays and try to get around Roemer's veto.
   The new bill had rape and incest provisions, but Roemer said
they weren't broad enough. He vetoed that bill Friday, 2{ weeks
after the regular session ended.
   Roemer also vetoed a bill that would have required warning
labels on potentially offensive recordings and could have sent
retailers to jail for selling such records to children. The music
industry had threatened to boycott New Orleans if that one became
law and Roemer said he was convinced the bill unconstitutionally
abridged free-speech rights.
   Lawmakers are talking about calling themselves into session in
mid-August just to override Roemer's vetos.
   The state Legislature's stress on traditional morality really
isn't new:
   _Louisiana has outlawed abortion since the 1800s, without
exceptions for rape or incest. Only the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision changed that.
   _In 1981, lawmakers passed a law requiring schoolteachers who
teach Darwin's theory of evolution to also teach ``scientific
creationism,'' an alternative theory that mankind was created and
didn't evolve from lower animals.
   Federal courts found scientific creationism more religious than
scientific and said public schools shouldn't be forced to give it
equal time.
   _Astute politicians running for statewide office seldom miss the
Pentecostals' Fourth of July-week camp meeting of some 8,000 people
at the central Louisiana town of Tioga.
   A frequent participant is former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who also
unashamedly frequents Nevada casinos and has a reputation for
womanizing.
   _Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's sprawling complex in Baton Rouge,
complete with Bible college, audio and video recording studios and
Family Worship Center, was a multimillion-dollar boon to the state
capital's economy _ at least until a sex scandal diminished the
preacher's popularity.
   ``Our people really support moral values,'' said Elton Pody,
mayor of the north Louisiana town of Ruston, who lobbied
legislators not only on municipal issues but also for the
anti-abortion bill.
   Wayne Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State
University, suggested another possible reason for the Legislature's
affection for issues of morality _ the state's sorry financial
condition.
   Until a few years ago, Parent said, balancing the state's
multibillion-dollar budget was easy. Oil prices were high and oil
taxes paid for everything.
   Things changed when oil prices plummeted in the mid-1980s.
   Lawmakers have had to cut services, put supposedly temporary
sales taxes on traditionally exempt items such as groceries and
medicine, and fight over Roemer's tax overhaul proposals, most of
which have died.
   Issues of abortion, the flag and smutty or drug-related records
were easy to deal with when the alternatives were a tight budget
and unpopular taxes, Parent said.
   ``These were almost welcome distractions,'' said Parent.
   Former state Rep. Kevin Reilly, who once called Louisiana a
``banana republic,'' agreed with that assessment.
   ``It's a diversionary tactic, no question about it,'' said
Reilly, who left the House in 1987 to devote more time to business.
   ``And every legislative body does that,'' he added. ``The United
States Congress does that. Just recently they were talking about a
flag burning amendment in the Congress when we have this huge
budget deficit.''
   Not even the director of one of Louisiana's most conservative
lobbying groups believes many people took the state flag bill
seriously.
   ``I think the flag burning bill was sort of thought of as a sort
of horseplay _ send a message, get a little chuckle, but don't get
too serious about it,'' said Ken Ward of the Louisiana Moral and
Civic Foundation.

   The victim of an attempted

though it almost meant delivering her baby on the witness stand.
   Chavez Lynch, a week overdue with her first child, was in the
first stages of labor when she was taken into the courtroom in a

   ``It was extremely obvious,'' said Municipal Court Judge Jack
Gifford. ``Just after she started testifying she had a contraction,
and it certainly concerned me.''
   Gifford asked Lynch if she wanted to continue.
   ``She said, `Yes, I'm here. I want to finish this.'''
   As soon as she finished testifying at the pretrial hearing,
Lynch was wheeled out of the courtroom and rushed to a hospital,
where she gave birth some hours later. The hospital, at Lynch's

<HEAD>Walesa Rivals Form New Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa's rivals in the Solidarity
movement founded their own party on Saturday and called for
Poland's next president to be elected by the people, not the
Parliament.
   The founding completes the split of the political movement that
struggled against the Communists in the 1980s, triumphed in
elections last year and dominates Poland's non-Communist government.
   The founding convention of the Citizens Movement for Democratic
Action drew more than 1,000 supporters. Many of those in the new
party were heroes of Solidarity's fight against Communist rule.
   Organizers said they wanted the party to be an alternative to
the Center Alliance, a 2-month-old pro-Walesa political party. They
said they would offer support to Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, whom Walesa has often criticized.
   Zbigniew Bujak, a leader of Solidarity during its underground
years, acknowleged the polarization of the movement, but he said
such a division ``does not have to be bad.''
   ``A democratic country is a country of different proposals. We
will have to forget about the otherwise comfortable structure in
which the picture was black and white _ just us against them,''
said Bujak.
   The new party's Polish acronym is ROAD, and it played on the
acronym's English meaning, calling itself the best road to
democracy. Behind the podium as Bujak spoke was huge white sheet
with a broken black line down the middle to represent a highway.
   In its first political step, the party convention voted nearly
unanimously to endorse a constitutional amendment calling for the
president to be elected by the people and not _ as now _ by the two
chambers of Parliament.
   Adam Michnik, who was once a key adviser to Walesa, criticized
the Center Alliance's call for an early presidential vote by
Parliament.
   ``We want the whole society to decide,'' he told a news
conference.
   The pro-Walesa group calls for electing Walesa president by the
current Parliament this fall, urges immediate privatization of the
economy and faster ouster of holdover Communists from positions of
authority.
   The new party wants early presidential elections but not by
Parliament, arguing the current chamber is tainted by the 1989
political deal that set aside a portion of seats for Communists.
   Walesa strategists believe they can put together enough votes in
Parliament to elect the Solidarity chairman president, where he
would oversee the drafting of an entirely new post-Communist
constitution. The new party sees Walesa as politically vulnerable
in a direct election.
   The new party's membership includes most of Walesa's longtime
advisers and allies in Solidarity, including filmmaker Andrzej
Wajda; parliamentary secretary Henryk Wujec and government
ministers Aleksander Hall, Jacek Kuron and Witold Trzeciakowski.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party
leader, elected to a six-year term a year ago, already has signaled
he will step down early.
   He sent a letter to Parliament on Saturday saying he agreed with
a planned September discussion on holding early presidential and
parliamentary elections.
   Jaruzelski's election was meant to prevent the Soviets from
stepping in to quash reforms. But now that Soviet influence has
waned across Eastern Europe, his presence is seen as anachronistic.

   In the heart of Asia, far from the tumult of the
Kremlin, a new mood of defiance and independence is taking hold.
This is the first installment of a four-part series by an AP
special correspondent who traveled through the restive Soviet south.

<TEXT>
   Townsfolk in this ancient capital of
tiled turquoise domes and haunting memories are starting to refer
to the Soviet state in the same past tense they apply to Tamerlane
and Genghis Khan.
   ``The Soviet Union is rotting away,'' said Alex Ulko, a young
painter and English student at the University of Samarkand.
``Within a few years, Asians will be shaping their own nations.''
   Moscow is omnipresent in Soviet Central Asia, from government
offices and Communist Party headquarters to donkey-riding KGB
informants in remote hamlets.
   But new political currents, rooted in an Islamic religious
revival, economic resentment and environmental concerns, are
carrying Asian peoples inexorably further from the Kremlin.
   Although Lenin's iron-cast goatee still juts resolutely forward
in city parks, Asians revere their own wise men, in flowing white
beards and colored robes, who evoke a past few have forgotten, a
past almost palpable at night when Islamic chants can be heard down
twisting lanes shaded by mulberries.
   The five Central Asian republics _ Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia _ stretch from the Caspian
Sea to China, an area almost as big as the United States. Their 50
million inhabitants, 20 million in Uzbekistan, make up a fifth of
the Soviet population. A few examine 21st century problems in
nuclear physics and biochemistry, but many more live in rag tents
or mud hovels, as in the days of the Golden Horde.
   In some ways Central Asia is marked indelibly by a century of
Russian czars and commissars. But many here see the Russian
interlude as destined to be yet another turn of history, no more
vital to the present than when camels plied the Silk Road from
China to Europe.
   New political parties, ecological movements, Moslem clergymen in
reopened mosques and young radicals all press for broader freedoms
leading to independence. Even local Communist Party cadres are
insisting on greater home rule.
   ``Perestroika has brought truth, but truth has brought unrest,''
noted Agzam Rahmidov, an English professor in this old crossroads
city in Uzbekistan.
   For one thing, Central Asians complain of economic exploitation.
The Uzbekistan prime minister, Shukrulla Mirsaidov, contends his
people pay out three times as much to the central government as
they get back.
   In June, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan refused to export food to
other republics at the low prices decreed by the state. Later, the
Uzbek Parliament adopted a preliminary ``declaration of
sovereignty.''
   Anti-Moscow sentiment reaches deep into daily life.
   Russian settlers are leaving the region at a quickening pace,
spurred by sporadic pogroms against ethnic minorities. Youths are
evading the military draft and rebelling against officers they
accuse of bias.
   In a nation fraught with more immediate crises, these pressures
stew largely out of sight.
   In June, a border clash between Uzbeks and Kirghizis in the old
holy city of Osh commanded attention as the official death toll
mounted to as high as 800. But when Soviet troops imposed calm, the
spotlight moved on.
   ``The situation in Central Asia is very serious, and we don't
understand it fully,'' said Igor Krupnik, a conflict specialist at
the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. ``No one has the data.''
   The problem, Central Asians say, is that distant analysts are
often thrown off by convenient generalities about peoples who are
anything but homogeneous.
   Over millennia, borders were traced across the sands by
conquerors, from the Mongol hordes, to Turkish tyrants like
Tamerlane, to the Russian czars. Josef Stalin drew the last map in
the 1920s, when the regions of Turkestan and Eastern Bukhara were
transformed into five republics.
   The plains of Kazakhstan, biggest and northernmost of the five,
separate European Russia from Asia. To the south lie the other
four: in the east, the small mountainous enclaves of Tadzhikistan
and Kirghizia, bordering China and Afghanistan; in the west, the
highlands and deserts of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, stretching
toward the oilfields of the Caspian Sea.
   These Central Asian neighbors are linked by the Koran and often
by common linguistic roots. But just as often they are divided by
disputes over land and water.
   In the Soviet grand plan, the whole region was given over to
cotton. Fields were irrigated from the majestic rivers Amu Darya
and Syr Darya, and Russian migrants settled frontier lands. Today
only 40 percent of the Kazakhstan population is Kazakh.
   But decades of poor planning have so bled the rivers that they
no longer replenish the Aral Sea. Half of the world's fourth
largest lake has dried up, its exposed lakebed now just loose salt
poisoned by pesticide runoff. To revive the Aral Sea, Uzbeks want
to cut off the Karakum Canal, used by the Turkmens to water their
desert.
   ``Land was exploited in the most disgusting colonial way,'' said
Sergei Kapitsa of the Physical Problems Institute in the Soviet
Academy of Sciences.
   Central Asian planners want to diversify from cotton. But the
region is short of energy. And the Tadzhiks, ensconced in high
mountains, balk at flooding villages for more hydroelectic dams.
   In this climate of tension, an isolated skirmish over a piece of
scarce farmland, like the one in Osh, can flash overnight into
pitched battles in capital cities hundreds of miles apart.
   Explosive mixtures have resulted from past Soviet policies of
dispersing inconvenient minorities to once-remote areas, such as
the Fergana Valley, which includes Osh.
   Last year, rampaging Uzbeks killed at least 100 people in
pogroms against Turks resettled from Georgia almost two generations
ago. Other minorities, including Russians, were also targeted.

   This February, an estimated 50 people were killed in riots in
the Tadzhik capital, Dushanbe, reportedly touched off by rumors
that Armenian refugees would settle there. In May, mobs burned 47
homes of Armenians and Jews in the Fergana Valley.
   Authorities cite local causes for each outbreak, sometimes
blaming unnamed political opportunists, religious fanatics or
drug-crazed hooligans. But others see deeper roots.
   ``The problem is social frustration among a generation of youths
who are losing their old values and see nothing to replace them,''
said Munira Shadheedi, a historian in Dushanbe.
   Opposition politicians, mostly writers and other intellectuals,
see a policy vacuum as Communist Party stalwarts push ahead with
only modifications of ideas that have failed to inspire confidence.
   These new leaders say it is too early to design specific
programs for independence. First, most say, they must abolish
entrenched official corruption, which impoverishes and embitters
their populations.
   Alternative parties are beginning to attract wide support. The
Uzbekistan popular front, Birlik, has inspired similar movements in
other republics. Krupnik said he saw signs these disparate
opposition groups were linking up, forging the beginnings of a
grass-roots movement across Central Asia.
   Their main obstacle is a historical aversion to mixing among
ethnic groups in the region, he said.
   If Central Asia mixes anywhere, it is here in Samarkand, a city
of 390,000 people that recently celebrated its 2,500th anniversary.
   The old mud synagogue blends unnoticed into a block of Moslem
houses. Men of all religions wear the same square black skullcaps
embroidered in white. A multitude of nationalities sits together
for tea and patterned wheels of bread, escaping the sun under shade
trees.
   But a chat with Samarkand university students suggests that this
harmony of old is changing fast.
   A Crimean Tatar woman felt growing antipathy and said her family
wanted badly to get home. Her Russian-Ukrainian friend said Uzbeks
are making up for lost time in reasserting national pride.
   ``There is a very dark fear which is difficult to understand,''
concluded a young Russian, like the others reluctant to be quoted
by name. ``We see discrimination against others. The Russians are
next.''

<HEAD>Circus Legislature Sets New Standards for Chaos in Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After passing the state's largest tax hike in
history, Massachusetts legislators tried to junk that plan and
tried to pass an even bigger package. Then on the same day, they
decided to return to the original plan.
   ``This is really a test,'' joked state Rep. John Flood. ``They
want to see how many dumb votes the Legislature will make in one
week.''
   But not many people have been laughing, especially not the Wall
Street analysts who have dropped Massachusetts' bond rating below
every other state.
   The Legislature finally enacted a balanced, $13.43 billion
budget early Saturday morning and a $1.43 billion bond
authoritization, but for months Massachusetts had struggled to
solve its fiscal difficulties.
   As Massachusetts economy continued to sink, the state ran up a
deficit exceeding $1 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
   Last week's events seemed to set new standards for Statehouse
chaos, and they came just when it appeared the state had put its
troubles behind.
   ``It will be less than a week before the Massachusetts
Legislature makes it into Johnny Carson's monologue,'' remarked
James Braude, head of the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts, a
group that favors higher taxes.
   After wrangling over the escalating budget deficit, lawmakers
had sent Gov. Michael S. Dukakis a $1.2 billion tax package.
   Dukakis signed the law, proclaiming ``the miracle is beginning
to revive,'' a reference to the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' theme of
his failed 1988 presidential campaign.
   Then legislative negotiators agreed on a budget for the fiscal
year that began July 1. Never mind that the budget was more than
three weeks late; Massachusetts has made this a habit in recent
years, forcing the state to adopt temporary spending plans.
   But the $13.7 billion budget presented Monday still had a $200
million-plus deficit. Dukakis would be able to bring balance it
with his line-item veto powers, but nonetheless lawmakers who were
still smarting over the tax battle decided to revolt.
   What emerged, to nearly everyone's shock, was a proposal to
repeal the just-passed tax plan, which included a controversial
sales tax on business services, and substitute another version
athat would cut the tax on services but make income taxes even
higher. The strategy was to appease House members by giving them a
package resembling a tax plan they approved earlier in the year.
   In the end, though, the plan to do a flip-flop on the tax plan
failed. The House Ways and Means Committee endorsed the measure,
but the resulting firestorm through the Statehouse killed it.
   Almost lost during the confusion was the fact that the state
still had that new tax law on the books.
   Even Senate President William Bulger, known for his strong
authority, said during the height of the recent chaos: ``I am here
and I am bewildered.''
   ``This is appalling,'' said Francis Faulkner, of Citizens for
Limited Taxation, an anti-tax group. ``You have legislators asking
what's going on. These are people who are supposed to represent the
state.''
   Faulkner's group is counting on public anger toward the
Legislature, because his organization is sponsoring a ballot
petition in November that would roll back state taxes and fees to
1988 levels, thereby undoing the new tax law.
   Also in November, voters will choose a new governor to replace
Dukakis, whose popularity tumbled like the state's bond ratings and
who decided against seeking re-election.
   Both Democrats and Republicans have campaigned against Dukakis'
policies, saying the antics in the Legislature demonstrate a lack
of leadership.
   ``This is far beyond a partisan issue. This is a matter of
whether people in other parts of the country think we're crazy,''
said Francis Bellotti, a Democratic gubernatorial contender and
former attorney general.
   ``The House blames the Senate. The Senate blames the House.
Everybody blames the governor,'' he said. ``This is absolute
insanity.''

   The execution of a convicted killer should
end weeks of controversy over whether Florida's electric chair is a
valid means of execution or a torture device as defense attorneys
claimed, the governor said.
   ``Florida should now be able to resume carrying out its capital
punishment statute,'' Gov. Bob Martinez said after Anthony
Bertolotti was pronounced dead Friday evening.
   ``The people of Florida can know that criminals who show a total
disregard for human life will indeed be called upon to pay the
ultimate penalty for their actions,'' the governor said.
   During the May 4 execution of Jesse Joseph Tafero, flames and
sparks shot from the inmate's head and smoke filled the execution
chamber. Tafero was finally declared dead after three jolts of
electricity.
   Attorneys for three condemned inmates won indefinite stays from
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta with arguments
that the electric chair was not functioning properly.
   As a result, Martinez ordered an independent examination of the
chair. In a demonstration witnessed Monday by the media and state
officials, Michael Morse, an associate professor of electrical
engineering at Auburn University, concluded the chair was
functioning properly and would send a lethal amount of electricity
through an inmate's body.
   Prison officials said a moistened synthetic sponge contact, used
for the first and only time in the Tafero execution, caused flames
to rise from his head.
   On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling by a lower
court that the chair's 2,000-volt charge is ``sufficient to cause
painless termination of life,'' ending the legal alternatives for
Bertolotti.
   The three cases held up by the 11th circuit would be the
likeliest to result in the next execution, the governor's press
secretary, Jon Peck, said Saturday.
   ``No decision has really been made on those other three, but
potentially at least they could be treated a little differently
because they all are basically ready and they were awaiting a
ruling on the workings of the chair itself,'' Peck said.
   Martinez, a strong advocate of the death penalty, applauded the
courts' decisions clearing the way for Bertolotti's death.
   ``It is gratifying that the courts concluded Florida's electric
chair does in fact work as it is designed to,'' the governor said.
   ``Today's events have begun to restore certainty to Florida's
ultimate penalty, and I commend the courts for moving toward that
eventual end,'' he said.
   Bertolotti was sentenced to die for the Sept. 27, 1983, murder
of Carol Ward. She was working in her yard in Orange County when
Bertolotti approached and asked to use the telephone, and she let
him in.
   He grabbed a knife, robbed her of $30 and then stabbed her
repeatedly until the knife broke. He then found another knife and
stabbed her until she died, leaving the knife in her body. At some
point, Bertolotti removed her clothes and raped her.
   An unrepentant Bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors
after his conviction, saying he wasn't sorry.
   ``I have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of Carol Ward,''
he wrote. She ``should have locked her damn door. I really did a
favor by taking her life, don't you think so?''
   Bertolotti was the 23rd inmate to die in the electric chair _
dubbed ``Old Sparky'' _ since Florida resumed executions in 1979.
   Since inmates carved ``Old Sparky'' from an oak tree almost
seven decades ago, it has killed 219 state murderers and rapists
and one federal killer.

<TEXT>
   Alberto Fujimori, the novice politician whose
election shocked Peru's power brokers, was sworn in today as
president of a country beset by staggering political and economic
problems.
   Fujimori assumed power from outgoing President Alan Garcia in an
elaborate ceremony in the capital. Earlier in the day, government
helicopters flew over Lima and thousands of policemen and soldiers
patrolled city streets.
   Despite the security measures, rebels late Friday blew up two
electrical towers to black out most of the city for the second
consecutive night.
   Earlier in the week guerrillas fired two rocket-propelled
grenades at the Presidential Palace. Recent fighting in the
country's Andean mountains and Amazonian jungle has left hundreds
dead.
   The violence prompted the heavy security for today's ceremony,
which was to be attended by a U.S. delegation headed by Secretary
of Education Lauro Cavazos.
   Peru's economy has become increasingly unstable in the days
leading up to Fujimori's swearing-in to five-year term.
   Many banks have run out of money and workers cannot cash their
checks. People must wait hours to buy rationed gasoline and bread.
The dollar's value jumped more than 75 percent in one week.
   Daily inflation topped the 6 percent mark by the end of the
week, according to the private economic firm Cuanto. Until last
week daily inflation had been running at about 1 percent.
   Key to reversing the economic collapse will be what Fujimori
says upon taking office, analysts say. Confidence in his government
will quickly evaporate if he does not soon offer detailed plans to
combat the crisis, they say.
   Fujimori has proposed harsh but vague measures to bring Peru's
economy under control. He said he wants to end price subsidies,
sell off many government companies and impose an emergency tax on
the wealthy.
   Fujimori plans a devaluation of the Peruvian inti that will make
the dollar cost 300 percent to 400 percent more.
   He has already met in New York with the heads of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Peru has been
isolated from world lenders since outgoing President Garcia cut
ties with the two institutions in 1986.
   But the new president will have little to work with. The
government is bankrupt and paralyzed by strikes. Four of five
people lack steady work. The country is $20 billion in debt. Peru's
main export is coca, the main ingredient used to make cocaine.
   The Peru Fujimori inherits also suffers from a severe drought
that has wiped out crops and drastically cut urban water supplies.
Hydroelectric plants run at half capacity and the daily blackouts
that result have greatly slowed industry.
   Politically, Fujimori's small Change 90 party is nearly isolated.
   Since his landslide victory over novelist and free-market
advocate Mario Vargas Llosa June 10, Fujimori has cut many ties
with the left and center-left parties that supported his campaign.
   Garcia, a populist, has called on workers to resist any economic
``shock'' program.
   But Peru's center-right parties have also shown little desire to
aid Fujimori. Former president Fernando Belaunde Terry has said
these parties were elected to form Fujimori's opposition.
   Peru's military, however, has been less reluctant to work with
the new president. An unprecidented three Cabinet positions _
defense, interior and fisheries _ will be held by military officers.
   The presence of a general atop Peru's powerful Interior Ministry
likely signals a stepped-up effort to combat the country's two main
guerrilla groups, analysts say. Peru's police force is controlled
by the Interior Ministry.
   The move comes as the Maoist Shining Path and the pro-Cuban
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement have stepped up attacks.
   More than 19,000 Peruvians have died in political violence in
the past 10 years.

   When Mark McEwen quit college one
semester before graduation, he told his parents: ``I went to
college to learn about people, so I don't need chemistry.''
   McEwen, who was raised in the suburbs between Baltimore and
Annapolis, says his hunch paid off.
   Besides acting as the weatherman and music editor for ``CBS This
Morning,'' he will be one of eight hosts for a late-night talk show
pilot, ``Midnight Hour.''
   McEwen's stint comes Aug. 13-17.
   ``It's a hoot to be on national television,'' said McEwen, 35.
``There you are as a kid ... in the teeming metropolis of Odenton
and you think, `What am I going to end up doing?' You don't imagine
this.''
   McEwen's destination when he left college in 1976 was Los
Angeles for a career in stand-up comedy, but he ended up as a disc
jockey back in Baltimore, then in Detroit, Chicago and New York.
   He started doing commercials, which led to the morning news show.
   ``Weather is OK, but it's not what I set out to do,'' he said.
``I do enjoy being able to say what I want. You have to be quick to
do this. Live TV is live, so they need somebody who can blab like I
can.''

   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I, the
spiritual leader of the world's Eastern Orthodox Christians, has
received an honorary degree from Hellenic College and Holy Cross
Greek Orthodox School of Theology.
   The honorary doctorate of divinity was awarded Friday, as the
75-year-old primate neared the end of a 27-day visit to the United
States. He returns to Europe on Sunday.
   The 269th successor to Andrew the Apostle, the patriarch
referred to the ages-old role of his predecessors as teachers of
``the word of God's truth.''
   He also repeated a message delivered throughout his trip,
telling the gathering of 2,000 people, ``Stand firm and go to the

   An investment company responded to
mismanagement charges leveled in a lawsuit by boxing champion
Thomas Hearns by saying his extravagant lifestyle sometimes left
him unable to pay his bills.
   Monthly financial statements filed Friday in Palm Beach Circuit
Court by the company being sued showed the Detroit fighter spent
$89,749 in April 1987.
   His spending included $2,288 for bedspreads, shams and curtains
for a boat, $7,688 for a television and antenna, and $800 for a
bodyguard, according to the statement from Davimos Advisors. There
was also $2,400 for child support.
   The documents were filed in response to a July 13 lawsuit by
Hearns charging the investment firm mishandled his money and
collected hidden commissions on his investments.
   ``There were times when he listened to our advice. There were
times he didn't,'' company President John Davimos said Friday from
the firm's Los Angeles office.
   In return for 2.5 percent of each purse, Davimos handled Hearns'
business affairs. The company also assisted Hearns' attorneys on
``various paternity suits and other legal matters,'' lawyer Larry
Duffy wrote in the response.
   Ted Souris, one of Hearns' lawyers, denied the World Boxing
Organization super-middleweight champion is having financial
problems.
   Besides asking the court to dismiss the suit, Davimos filed a
counterclaim for $170,000, the firm's share of Hearns' earnings
from the Leonard fight.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem extremists who stormed
into Parliament firing automatic weapons held the prime minister
and other officials hostage Saturday. Trinidad's archbishop said
the rebels had wired the captives with explosives.
   The rebels said they had overthrown the government in the attack
Friday afternoon, but Education Minister Clive Pantin said Saturday
that the government had not fallen and was in control of the
situation.
   The Red Cross said several people were wounded, and a news
report said three people were killed.
   After bursting into the Parliament building Friday afternoon,
the rebels from the Black Moslem group took Prime Minister Arthur
N. Robinson and members of his Cabinet hostage. Some captives were
apparently being held in the Parliament building called Red House
and others in a TV station.
   Archbishop Anthony Pantin said on government radio he talked to
coup leader Abu Bakr for 25 minutes Saturday afternoon. He said
Bakr told him the TV building was surrounded by men with guns and
he would detonate the captives and himself if an attack was
launched.
   ``He has informed me that the prime minister and other
parliamentarians in the Red House are wired up with explosives,''
Pantin said.
   Police superintendent Leonard Taylor imposed a curfew until 1
p.m. Sunday. Acting President Joseph Emmanuel Carter declared a
state of emergency Saturday morning and put the country's
5,000-member army and 1,500-member police on alert. Carter was
serving as president while President Noor Hassanali was in London.

<HEAD>Killings of Medellin Police Continue After Cartel Declares Truce</HEAD>

   Gunmen killed four more police officers
in Medellin, three of them after the city's cocaine cartel declared
an end to its campaign of bombings and assassinations, police said
Saturday.
   Minutes before the Extraditables, as the Medellin drug bosses
call themselves, sent a message by facsimile mail to the local
press Friday calling for a truce, gunmen killed a police officer,
according to a police statement.
   Three other police officers were assassinated later in the day,
the statement said.
   ``We decree a unilateral, indefinite cease-fire and we suspend
attacks against police, bombings in all Colombian cities and the
executions of politicians, journalists, judges and other
functionaries,'' the statement said, which claimed the cartel was
responsible for the murders of 215 police officers this year in
Medellin and the surrounding region.
   The authenticity of the statement could not be independently
verified.
   Police say the cartel is paying assassins $4,000 for each police
officer killed.
   The Extraditables' statement said the killings were in
retaliation for the murder and torture of suspected cartel members
by police.
   Police deny the charge. Human rights officials say there is
strong evidence that members of the force are participating in
slayings in Medellin's poorer neighborhoods, where the cartel's
killers are based.
   About the same time the cartel's statement was being released, a
bomb exploded at a police post in the Medellin neighborhood of
Villanueva, wounding five people, including a child, police said.
   El Tiempo, the country's largest newspaper, quoted police
sources as saying that Friday's communique by the cartel was part
of a strategy by cartel leader Pablo Escobar to have the government
scale down its escape manhunt for him.
   Earlier this year, the Medellin cartel suspended its terrorist
attacks as part of a peace overture to the goverment. The violence
resumed after the administration of President Virgilio Barco ruled
out negotiations with the cartel.
   Since August 1989, when Barco began his drug crackdown,
traffickers have been blamed for the deaths pf more than 450
Colombians in terrorist attacks.
   The government is continuing to crack down on the traffickers'
organization in Medellin. Authorities on Friday arrested 17
Medellin residents suspected of working for the drug cartel as
hired killers, an army communique said.
   Meanwhile, police and hospital officials said that at least 18
civilians were killed late Friday by unidentified armed groups in
Medellin, Colombia's second biggest city.
   Authorities also announced that they were increasing Medellin
police salaries by 25 percent. Police now earn about $100 a month,
not including benefits.
   The low salaries are repeatedly signaled as a major cause of
police corruption and inefficiency.

<TEXT>
   One of Mayor Marion Barry's long-time security
officers has been reassigned by the city police department and may
face further investigation after his testimony at Barry's drug and
perjury trial was contradicted, law enforcment sources say.
   James Stays, a 29-year police veteran, has been reassigned to an
administrative post pending an internal police investigation into
whether he has used cocaine or covered up drug use by Barry, police
sources say.
   A government witness testified Friday that she used cocaine with
Stays at a 1985 cookout in suburban Kettering, Md. Stays, the first
defense witness to testify for Barry, said he never saw drugs on a
1986 trip with Barry took to the Virgin Islands. He also denied
ever using drugs.
   The government witness, former civilian police employee Delois
Mise, also testified that she once saw Stays and Barry together in
a hotel room where a small bag of what appeared to be cocaine was
lying on a table.
   Edward Sussman, Stays' attorney, could not be reached for
comment Saturday.
   Prosecutors also produced a city government document Friday
indicating a defense witness was not at work the day he said he
took a job application from a government witness who had said she
had personally delivered the application _ and crack cocaine _ to
Barry.
   A government form introduced into evidence by prosecutors
indicated that Clifton Roberson was absent from his job on Sept. 7,
1988, the day he said he received a job application from admitted
cocaine dealer Lydia Reid Pearson.
   Pearson testified that she gave Barry drugs and the application
on that day.
   Barry's trial resumes Monday, when prosecutors expect to
conclude their rebuttal case. The defense ended its case Friday
without calling Barry to the witness stand.
   The case could go to the jury late in the week. Jury selection
for the trial began June 4.
   The police investigation of Stays could the first probe the
Barry bodyguard faces, sources said.
   ``He will be dealt with administratively first, within the
police department,'' said one federal law enforcment source. The
source said tht federal prosecutors may conduct their own
investigation later.
   Judy Smith, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens,
declined to comment.
   No further action has been taken against Stays for fear of
afffecting the outcome of Barry's trial, one police source said.
   ``The last thing we want to do is give (Barry defense atorney R.
Kenneth) Mundy a reason to say, `Hey, they moved against this guy
because he defended the mayor.''
   The investigation of Stays will begin once the mayor's trial is
completed, the police sources said.
   If evidence of criminal conduct is discovered, those details
will be provided to the U.S. Attorney's office, which, for reasons
of protocol, normally allows the police department to carry out an
internal probe before pursuing a criminal investigation of an
offficer, the police source explained.
   Violations of police administrative procedures will be handled
within the department, the police source said. A variety of
punishments would be possible, including a reduction in Stays' rank
or pension level.
   Police and other law enforcement sources said factors that could
weigh against prosecution of Stays include his seniority and stated
intention to retire within the next year.
   ``He has told a number of people, before all this happened, that
he intended to retire when he reached 30 years of service,'' one
police source said. ``If he is gone, that might affect a decision
to prosecute.''

   State highway workers weren't smiling last
week when they discovered some new faces in their midst.
   Unauthorized signs depicting a frowning face at the beginning of
road construction along westbound Interstate 70 just east of
suburban Reynoldsburg and a smiling face at the end of it were
ordered removed Thursday.
   Officials believe the inent of the unidentified signmaker was to
make the going a little easier for construction-weary motorists
passing through the three-mile site. The signs were erected
sometime Wednesday night.
   ``I think they are cute, but they are dangerous,'' said Michael
Cull, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation.
   In all, four signs dotted the route. The first bore a frown, the
second had no expression, the third showed a hint of a smile and
the final face at the end of the construction wore a wide grin.
   The signs appeared official and resembled the yellow-and-black
``Have a nice day'' pins and stickers that were seemingly
ubiquitous several years ago.
   Cull said the signs had to go because they were not standard
issue. He also said that any signs not designed to direct drivers
safely through such sites are considered dangerous.
   About four years ago, a similar setup, which had progressively
happier faces, was done by the authorities themselves in Michigan.
State officials received more than 300 letters of support from
motorists.
   One letter writer at the time, a Baptist minister from New York,
called the signs ``a blessing to me.''

<HEAD>France Says Release of Terrorist Raises Hope for Lebanon Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France's
decision to pardon a convicted terrorist whose freedom had long
been sought by Iran may help win the freedom of all Western
hostages in Lebanon, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   An Iranian newspaper on Saturday also tied the release of Anis
Naccache to the hostage issue. The pardon was widely criticized by
newspapers, some politicians and various lobbying groups.
   President Francois Mitterrand pardoned Naccache and four
accomplices Friday and put them on a plane for Tehran.
   Naccache had served 10 years of a life sentence for the failed
assassination of Shahpour Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   A policeman and a passer-by were killed and another policeman
paralyzed in the 1980 assassination attempt in Paris.
   Naccache was allegedly acting on Iranian orders and his
imprisonment has been a major object of contention between France
and Iran.
   ``This measure excuses neither the crime nor the criminals,''
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told the Le Monde newspaper in a
Saturday interview.
   Dumas said he expected the freeing of Naccache to result in ``a
general calming, a lowering of tensions in the region, and, I also
hope, we are working toward it, the liberation of all Western
hostages still held'' in Lebanon.
   Dumas' words increased speculation that the release of Naccache
could help efforts to free the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon,
including six Americans.
   An official Iranian news agency report said on July 7 that a
European hostage would soon be released. Syrian military sources in
Lebanon said the released hostage would likely be Brian Keenan, an
Irish teacher held hostage in Lebanon for four years. But no word
has been heard from his kidnappers.
   The Tehran Times, an English language newspaper in Iran, wrote
Saturday that Naccache's release ``can even be expected to add to
the optimism that has been created for the release of one or two
European hostages.''
   The paper is believed to reflect the thinking of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   It urged other Western governments to follow the French lead,
saying ``such moves can facilitate the Iranian republic's
humanitarian efforts to convince the Lebanese groups to free the
hostages.''
   France is the only Western nation that has managed to free all
its hostages from Lebanon.
   Besides Keenan, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups in Lebanon hold
six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss and an
Italian.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Iran claims the former government of Premier Jacques Chirac made
a deal to pardon Naccache in exchange for the freedom of the last
three French hostages held in Lebanon. They were freed in May 1988,
days before the French presidential election, which Chirac lost.
   Chirac, a conservative, denied again Friday any deal had been
struck.
   Dumas also said there had been no negotiations on the issue with
Tehran.
   But Iran has made its wishes known on numerous occasions and
France has met many other Iranian demands.
   In June 1986 France expelled Massoud Rajavi, head of a guerrilla
group fighting to overthrow the Iranian government, and in November
1987, provided a plane to Tehran for Iranian embassy translator
Wahid Gordji. He had been wanted for questioning in a 1986 wave of
bombings in Paris. In each case, French hostages were freed.
   France also repaid part of a $1 billion debt to Iran. French
observers predict the freeing of Naccache will aid in settling the
financial dispute, which dates to the 1979 Iranian revolution, and
pave the way for business ventures.
   The chief lawyer for Naccache, Antoine Comte, said Saturday the
families of the five freed terrorists paid $740,000 in damages to
the victims, as ordered in 1982 by the court.
   Half of the money is to go to Bernard Vigna, who was paralyzed
for life in the assassination attempt. But the policeman's mother
told Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, that the family
did not want ``dirty money.'' The family refused to comment on the
release of Naccache, saying only their reaction was ``bad.''

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter, if
confirmed, could provide key votes on such issues as abortion
counseling, fetal protection and school desegregation in the
1990-91 court term that begins Oct. 1.
   The justices could be closely divided on those and other issues
already docketed for decision, and Souter's views on them are a
mystery.
   Legal scholars and lawyers following the cases say retired
Justice William J. Brennan's votes would have been predictably
liberal. The book on Souter: He's a conservative. The big question:
How conservative?
   ``We're going from a known quantity in Brennan to an unknown,''
said Clarke Forsythe, general counsel of Americans United for Life,
an anti-abortion group closely watching the abortion-counseling and
fetal-protection cases before the court.
   At issue in the first are federal regulations that bar
government-financed family planning centers from counseling women
about abortion. The regulations are being attacked as alleged
violations of free-speech and abortion rights.
   The so-called Title X program gives about $200 million a year to
some 4,000 clinics nationwide that serve about 5 million low-income
women.
   Forsythe, who wants the court to uphold the regulations, says he
expects Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens, the court's three most liberal members, to vote to strike
them down.
   He said he hoped the court's conservative bloc _ Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _ will unite to say
the regulations are valid.
   ``It's not an easy case, and Souter could play a key role,''
Forsythe said.
   The second case could affect millions of working women. The
court must decide whether employers may exclude all women of
childbearing age from some hazardous, but comparatively
high-paying, jobs to protect their fetuses.
   At issue is a car battery manufacturer's policy of banning women
who cannot prove they are infertile from jobs that expose them to
lead.
   ``Justice Brennan will be missed in both the workplace case and
the Title X case,'' said Patricia Ireland of the National
Organization for Women.
   ``He would have found (the fetal protection policy) to be
offensive and inappropriate in that it ignores what exposure to
lead does to men's reproductive systems. And he had a great history
of respect for freedom of speech and women's rights,'' Ms. Ireland
said.
   Susan Ross of the Sex Discrimination Center at Georgetown
University's law school, said the outcome of the fetal protection
case could hinge on Souter.
   ``We have reason to hope that Blackmun, Marshall and Stevens
will be with us, and we think O'Connor probably will be with us,''
Ms. Ross said. ``We don't have much hope of picking up Rehnquist,
Kennedy or Scalia. Perhaps White will vote against the policy, but
I'm not optimistic. It's possible the outcome could depend on
Souter.''
   She added, ``Souter hasn't had to deal with
employment-discrimination matters. It's very difficult to fathom
where he'd come out.''
   The court also must decide whether public school districts may
abandon the forced busing of students after achieving racial
balance in their schools if such a move would lead to resegregation.
   The ruling in an Oklahoma City case could be enormously
important for the hundreds of school districts, including those in
most major cities, under court-ordered busing plans for racial
desegregation.
   ``I would suspect Justice Brennan would not have been on our
side in this one,'' said William Pendley of the conservative
Mountain States Legal Foundation. ``His absence from the case is a
positive step, but Souter would be a question mark.''
   Even American business is busy assessing the impact of Brennan's
exit and Souter's possible entrance, most immediately in the
controversy over the skyrocketing awards won in personal injury
lawsuits and other cases.
   At issue in a case the court has under study is whether such
awards can go so high they become unconstitutional. The justices
last year said whopping awards never can violate the Constitution's
ban on excessive fines but it left unanswered whether they might
violate due-process rights.
   ``This is a big one, and we generally knew where Justice Brennan
was coming from,'' said Jan Amundson, general counsel of the
National Association of Manufacturers. ``He wasn't always
anti-business. But Souter is an unknown. We're optimistic but
uncertain.''
   The court began its summer recess last month with 54 cases
already scheduled for argument and decision in the coming term. The
justices likely will add 80 to 90 more cases to that docket through
next winter.
   ``Next year at this time, I wouldn't be surprised to count 15 or
20 decisions that would have gone the other way had Brennan still
been on the court,'' Northwestern University law professor Lawrence
Marshall said.
   Others are more interested in which _ not how many _ cases will
fall into that category.

   Teen-agers with time on their hands and
gas in their tanks poured into this town for its first officially
sanctioned Cruisin' Night, turning the narrow streets into a kind
of ``Appalachian Graffiti.''
   Whether riding in T-top sports cars, sitting on the tailgates of
parked pickups or just standing on the street corner sipping free
soft drinks, the teen-agers made the scene Friday night.
   ``You drive around and holler at some girls and park, and they
come by and see you and pull in and talk to you,'' said 16-year-old
Freddie Anderson of Belfry, Ky., as he sat on the roof of his
Camaro.
   Officials and merchants in this town on the Kentucky-West
Virginia border thought up Cruisin' Night after officials in
several other cities cracked down on cruisers by enforcing traffic
and loitering laws.
   Prizes were awarded in four categories: ``Best Looking Cruiser
Car,'' ``Best Looking Cruiser Truck,'' ``Loudest Cruiser'' and
``Best Vanity Plate.'' Other prizes were awarded based on random
drawings from registrations at the end of the three-hour event.
   The teen-age traffic jam resembled scenes from the movie
``American Graffiti,'' which depicted cruisers in a California town
in the early 1960s.
   Downtown Williamson was packed Friday night with teen-agers, and
occasionally with older drivers who found themselves caught in the
bumper-to-bumper traffic, sometimes with panicked expressions.
   As the sun went down, the T-tops came off and the car stereos
came on. The rap song ``Pump Up the Jam'' filled the air.
   Some drivers parked their cars and trucks and watched the others
drive up two blocks on Second Avenue, left one block on Pike
Street, down two blocks on Third Avenue and left one block on
Harvey Street, ready to begin the circuit again.
   A line of cars stretching across two bridges into Kentucky
waited to join the parade in this town of 5,000-plus people.
   ``It gets pretty boring after a while, but there's nothing else
to do here,'' said Heather Gannon, 15, as she sat on the tailgate
of a pickup truck. ``This is it.''
   Richard Foster, 20, said he and the half-dozen young men with
him would have come downtown even without the Cruisin' Night
promotion.
   ``We're always here,'' said Foster, a weekend cruiser for five
years.
   City police Sgt. R.E. Pyrtle, walking his beat, said the
promotion appeared to bring the teen-agers downtown a little
earlier than usual but said there was no trouble.
   ``Friday and Saturday nights, the kids mainly come here about 10
o'clock and cruise, but not to the extent it is tonight,'' he said.
   As the cruisers cruised Friday night, several adults watched
from park benches outside the Mingo County Courthouse.
   ``I think it's just fine if it works out right,'' said Inice
Ball, 79. ``I think it's fine for our young people, because there's
nothing for them to do here.''
   Williamson's invitation to the teen-age cruisers contrasts with
what other area cities are doing.
   In Charleston, nearly 60 miles to the northeast, police reacted
to merchant complaints about noisy, littering teens this summer by
strictly enforcing traffic regulations.
   Across the Tug River from Williamson in South Williamson, Ky.,
police have taken steps to block cruisers from congregating in a
mall parking lot.
   But Colin Berry, president of the Williamson merchants'
association and an organizer of Cruisin' Night, declined to
criticize officials who want to put the brakes to cruising.
   ``It's not up to me to judge what someone else should do,'' he
said. ``Different towns have different problems.''

   Rebel soldiers fought to within one
mile of President Samuel Doe's fortified mansion on Saturday and
battled pockets of government troops for control of a hill
overlooking the city center.
   Meanwhile, five European ambassadors warned that the country was
slipping into ``anarchy and national suicide,'' called for an
urgent U.N. Security Council meeting, and suggested that U.S.
troops intervene.
   While the forces of National Patriotic Front leader Charles
Taylor remained blocked by government troops six miles east of the
capital, the smaller force of a rival rebel leader, Prince Johnson,
advanced into the city.
   Johnson's disciplined rebel forces, neatly dressed in camouflage
uniforms, carefully picked off snipers' nests as they moved up the
steep hill toward the Ducor Palace Hotel, which has a view of the
city center. Rifle and machine gun fire reverberated across the
hill, as civilians hid in their houses.
   Johnson's rebels took control of the Waterside and West Point
districts, at the city end of one of the two bridges from Bushrod
Island. The island is on the opposite side of the city from Doe's
mansion, one mile away.
   Doe has pledged to make his final stand inside the heavily
fortified mansion. The rebels, who began their offensive in
December, accuse the government of corruption and human rights
abuses and demand Doe's resignation.
   The five ambassadors representing European Economic Community
nations issued their warning Friday. Italian Ambassador Gianguido
Lanzoni advised his government on behalf of all the EEC ambassadors
that ``the interdependence of nations no longer permits other
nations to sit idle while one country plunges into anarchy and
national suicide.''
   ``There is no longer any effective government in control of this
country,'' Lanzoni told his government in a cable. He advised his
government to call the U.N. Security Council into emergency session
to discuss the chaos and killing of civilians on both sides in
Liberia's civil war.
   And he suggested the European countries should look favorably on
any American move to intervene ``in view of the special
relationship'' between Liberia and the United States.'' There are
four U.S. warships off the coast of the West African nation,
founded by the descendants of freed American slaves.
   But the United States has refused to intervene, saying the war
is an internal Liberian affair.
   The civil war has degenerated into tribal war between members of
Doe's Krahn tribe and Gio and Mano tribesmen, many of whom support
the rebels. Diplomats say both sides have indiscriminately killed
civilians.
   Taylor, in a message broadcast Friday and Saturday over a local
radio station, declared the dissolution of Doe's government and
promised to hold elections in six months. Taylor said the Doe
government was to be replaced by a National Patriotic
Reconstruction assembly of which he will be leader.
   But reports from rebel-held territory said Taylor remained 30
miles from the front, and his forces were making little progress.
   One of Taylor's commanders conceded the government was still
holding Spriggs-Payne Airfield in eastern Monrovia.
   On the other side of town, Doe's hard-pressed troops retreated
with one of their three tanks from Broad Street, near the Ducor, to
Center Street, outside the Defense Ministry, about half a mile from
the mansion.
   The tank was so crammed with goods looted from shops in the
neighbourhood that the crew barely had room to maneuver.
   Streets in the city center were deserted and all shops remained
closed.
   A group of three foreign reporters walked through the no-man's
land between the two armies and into the rebel-occupied waterside
district. They spoke with rebels who were engaged in heavy
exchanges of gunfire with government forces.
   At the junction of United Nations Drive and West Point Road, two
bodies lay in the street. When the reporters went past the same
place an hour later, another body was lying on the sidewalk. All
were dead soldiers.
   Market people in West Point watched the fighting from their
houses which had fallen behind rebel lines overnight. They sold
what little food they had left, mostly tea bags and small tins of
tomato paste. Fishermen set their nets to haul in sardines, which
they sold at $2.50 a pound. A tiny sea ray was offered for 50 cents.
   Half a mile from the rebel checkpoint at West Point, two
government soldiers had pulled up in a car and were talking to the
wife of one of them. Ahead of them was only the empty street,
littered with garbage.
   The wife hurredly threw her husband a pair of jeans, a T-shirt
and shoes, yelling ``change, change.'' Then she was gone, while the
soldier shamefacedly began taking off his army uniform and putting
on his civilian disguise.

<HEAD>Iraq Threatens to Retaliate Against U.S. Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The speaker of Parliament said Saturday
that Iraq is prepared to retaliate against a U.S. decision to
impose economic and trade sanctions against Baghdad.
   The U.S. Senate voted Friday to cut off $1.2 billion in U.S.
loan guarantees to Iraq. The Senate also moved to bar sales of
weapons and sensitive technology to Iraq.
   The Senate move, and a watered-down sanctions package approved
by the House, were signs of growing congressional concern about
Iraq's human rights abuses, intimidation of its neighbors,
harboring of terrorists and developing chemical and nuclear weapons
programs.
   The Iraqi legislator, Saad Mahdi Saleh, warned Iraq may impose
its own sanctions against the United States.
   ``We flatly refrain from having economic relations with those
who have no interest in having economic relations with us,'' Saleh
said.
   Saleh, who is also a member of the policy-making council of the
ruling Baath Party, said the Senate decision was motivated by the
pro-Israeli lobby in the United States.
   His remarks, reported by the official Iraqi News Agency, were
the first Iraqi reaction to the Friday vote.
   ``We, the representatives of the Iraqi people, express our
surprise at the illogical decision taken by those Congress members
who are either threatened or misled by the Zionists and their
premeditated propaganda,'' Saleh said.
   Saleh praised those legislators who voted against the sanctions
move. ``We see those who belittle us as the minutest and meanest of
creatures,'' he said.

   Balloon pilot James Johnson has drawn a
lot of attention at the 1990 U.S. National Hot Air Balloon
Championship.
   For one thing, the 72-year-old Johnson is the oldest entrant in
this year's championship, which ends Sunday.
   And unlike most other pilots, he literally flies by the seat of
his pants, sitting beneath his multicolored homemade balloon, the
Wallaby, in a chair instead of the usual brown wicker basket.
   ``I wanted to do something a little different,'' said Johnson,
who took his first balloon ride at age 60. ``You do get an awful
lot of attention. Everywhere you go, you're a star.''
   Although he owns a traditional ballooning basket, Johnson said
he enjoys a more open-air feeling when he's flying.
   ``I'm so used to this thing that it doesn't bother me anymore,''
he said. ``I like this one better.''
   Airborne with a large fuel tank positioned behind his back and a
neon orange helmet atop his head, Johnson looks more like Flash
Gordon than a retired electronics engineer from Garland, Texas.
   Though he took up the sport at a late age, he said he always
dreamed of being a pilot.
   ``I was just determined to learn to fly,'' he said. ``I had been
interested for a long time, and I lived in Europe, where they do
quite a bit of gas ballooning.''

<HEAD>Agency That Used Tax Money for Parties Seeks to Cleanse Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTAGE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of a federally funded job
training center held parties at a fine resort and bought VCRs for
home use, thanks to a loophole allowing them to spend interest on
federal grants any way they wanted. Now, some congressmen are
seeking to close that loophole.
   All told, the South Central Private Industry Council, a
federally financed job assistance agency, spent more than $20,000
on parties and other luxuries in the last four years.
   The council has been investigated over the last three months,
and the probe's findings may lead Congress to revise a federal law
that allows job agencies to spend interest earned on federal Job
Training Partnership Act money at their own discretion.
   ``It hurts the public perception of carrying out the intent of
the program. This is out there for training disadvantaged and
displaced workers,'' said David Williams, deputy assistant
secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the job
program.
   Williams said several congressmen have moved to revise the law
to mandate that money be used only for job training.
   The SCPIC, one of 17 such agencies in Wisconsin, has a $2.4
million budget this year and employs nine workers. It is
responsible for training unemployed and displaced workers in four
south-central Wisconsin counties and finding them jobs.
   Of the $20,900 spent by the council, $13,509 was for the last
three annual meetings held each August at the Chula Vista resort in
Wisconsin Dells, a popular tourist haven.
   Last August, council members spent about $4,000 on the annual
party, including $2,450 on lodging, dinners, drinks, and nightclub
admissions; $480 to rent a boat for a ride around a lake and $400
for hors d'oeuvres, records showed.
   In December, the council spent $951 on a Christmas party for the
staff at the Fur, Fin and Feather restaurant in Oxford.
   And earlier this year, the council staff purchased four
videocassette recorders at a cost of $1,196. Employees took them
home.
   Administrators defended the purchases, saying the workers would
use the equipment at home to bolster skills they lack the time to
improve in the office.
   When an audit first disclosed the spending, the council's former
marketing director, Jane Stroede, and others defended the parties
as a necessary means for thanking volunteer board members.
   ``I don't think fun is against the public interest,'' Ms.
Stroede said in April.
   But the council has since changed its position after months of
stinging criticism from government watchdogs. It has fired its
director, Mary Zilisch, and created a committee to review all
spending and operations.
   Council board member Ronald Thompson, chairman of the review
committee, said the board will vote in the next month on
improvements, including a recommendation that no taxpayer money be
used for parties.
   ``It's a matter of public perception,'' Thompson said in
explaining the changes.
   State officials are also promising the agency will get plenty of
increased regulation.
   But even with the changes, the council may have done irreparable
harm by ruining public trust and blemishing a program that many
government watchdogs already have distrusted for years, some say.
   ``They've got a terrible record,'' said former U.S. Sen. William
Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat who built a reputation during his
three decades in Congress for demanding frugal spending with his
``Golden Fleece'' awards.
   He claimed the program has cost $18.5 billion since the act
passed in 1982, but statistics show it helps only one in 20
participants get off welfare.

<HEAD>Newcomer Alberto Fujimori Sworn in As Peruvian President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with details of inauguration, speech. No

<TEXT>
   Political newcomer Alberto Fujimori, sworn in
Saturday as president of beleaguered Peru, offered dialogue with
Marxist rebels and promised fairer treatment for the South American
nation's poor.
   The new president attacked corruption and pledged to lead
debt-ridden Peru back into the international community of nations.
   He also said the blame for the international narcotics problem
lies with cocaine-consuming nations as well as drug-producing
nations like Peru. Peru is the world's main source of the coca
plant, from which cocaine comes.
   The bespectacled 52-year-old former college president _ an upset
winner in elections in June _ accepted the red-and-white sash of
office and said ``I swear by God'' to try to solve Peru's problems.
   ``Peruvians are fed up with being fed up,'' he said.
   Fujimori's comments at the ceremony in the red-carpeted,
cedar-paneled the House of Representatives chamber brought cheers
from lawmakers.
   The new president was celebrating his birthday on Saturday,
which is also Peru's independence Day.
   Fujimori, who is to serve until 1995, faces daunting problems.
He mentioned the 2.2 million percent inflation over the past five
years, increasing poverty, its bloated bureaucracy, drug
trafficking and terrorism.
   ``The people elected us to institute a new language of
nationwide understanding _ the language of dialogue, cooperation
and a search for consensus,'' Fujimori said. The backdrop was a
bronze frieze of Gen. Jose de San Martin, Peru's 19th-century
liberator, and a large wooden crucifix.
   The new president asked for special congressional power to
decree new and fairer taxes, presumably on Peru's wealthy elite.
   He said he would set up a special anti-corruption committee,
simplify customs regulations, reduce government participation in
the economy and push for measures to give ordinary Peruvians
greater access to government officials.
   When Fujimori said his administration would be ``implacable'' in
its fight against government corruption, many members of Congress
stood up and chanted their approval.
   The new leader did not mention by name his leftist populist
predecessor Alan Garcia, who took office in 1985. But he said: ``We
inherited a disaster.''
   Garcia's farewell speech drew boos from some lawmakers, and a
few walked out.
   Fujimori said he would scrap a bank-nationalization law that
went on the books under Garcia but never was implemented. He
repeated a campaign pledge to reverse Garcia's policy of freezing
out Peru's creditors and ignoring the $20 billion foreign debt.
   ``Our administration is resolved to re-establish Peru's
international relations in the financial field,'' the new president
said. He said he hopes to stimulate foreign investment in Peru.
   On drugs, Fujimori took a stand similar to that of President
Virgilio Barco of Colombia. Barco who was on hand for the
inauguration, along with the presidents of Argentina, Bolivia,
Chile and Venezuela.
   Fujimori said cocaine-consuming countries are just as
responsible for stopping drug use as are South American nations
that grow coca leaf and turn it into cocaine.
   ``You cannot place the weight of the responsibility for this
fight on a poor country buried in a severe economic crisis,''
Fujimori said. He said Peruvian peasants who grow coca to survive
need an alternative.
   The Bush administration is pressuring the Andean nations to
militarize their fight against the cocaine trade. Washington has
offered Peru $35 million in military aid.
   ``This is not a simple military question ... due to the obvious
and indisputable demand of a powerful market outside Peru,''
Fujimori said.
   The new president also proposed ``reason and dialogue'' to deal
with Marxist rebels. Political violence has resulted in about
19,000 deaths in the last decade.
   Fujimori said Peru also must improve living conditions in the
remote, impoverished Andean highlands, where terrorists _
principally the fanatical Marxist Shining Path rebels _ have their
strongholds.
   Garcia had also called for dialogue with terrorist groups, but
the response was increased assassinations and bombings.

<HEAD>Unresolved McMartin Case Left Many Victims in its 7-Year Wake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The McMartin Pre-school child molestation
case began in a wildfire of bizarre accusations that swept in from
the seaside community of Manhattan Beach to engulf Southern
California for seven years.
   When the longest, costliest case in U.S. history ended last week
with a deadlocked jury, the passion that ignited it was all but
extinguished and the anger that kept it going erupted only
intermittently.
   But left in the ashes of the McMartin case are many victims.
   Raymond Buckey, 32, who endured five years in jail and two
trials, said his family suffered beyond measure.
   The jury in the first trial acquitted Buckey of 40 charges last
January and cleared his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 12
counts. That jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey, and
prosecutors refiled eight.
   The jury in his second trial deadlocked Friday on eight
molestation charges and a mistrial was declared. Prosecutors said
there would be no third trial in the case that cost Los Angeles
County more than $13.5 million.
   ``I'd like to get for my family the house that was taken away
from them,'' Buckey said afterwards. Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and
her husband, Charles, had to sell their home and the prestigious
school, which grandmother Virginia McMartin had operated for 22
years, to pay legal costs.
   Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, a teacher of handicapped children,
lost her teaching credential but won it back in a long, bitter
battle after charges against her were dismissed.
   Teachers Betty Raidor, Babette Spitler and Mary Ann Jackson lost
their careers as nursery school teachers, even though they were
ultimately cleared.
   ``The case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it,'' the
judge in the first trial said at one point. ``By that I mean every
witness, every litigant and every judicial officer. It's a very
upsetting case.''
   Those words from Superior Court Judge William Pounders came
after two witnesses had died, one by his own hand, the other from
alcohol-related disease. And the children who fueled the case with
claims of satanic rituals, animal sacrifices and molestations were
balking at repeated ordeals on the witness stand.
   The newscaster who first broke the McMartin story lost his job
and jurors learned he had an affair with a therapist who
interviewed the McMartin children at Children's Institute
International.
   The saga began in August 1983 when a mother reported to police
that her son had been molested at the preschool. Hysteria followed
after police asked parents to check their children for signs of
molestation. Hundreds of parents reported their children were
victims, and tots were rushed to the institute for interviews.
Therapists decided more than 100 probably had been molested.
   Everyone agreed that the children who testified were victims of
the long litigation.
   ``Those kids cannot be McMartin kids for the rest of their
lives,'' prosecutor Joseph Martinez said after jurors deadlocked in
Buckey's second trial Friday. ``It's been a horrible experience.''
   But some parents would not give up.
   ``My child was not called as a witness in either trial,'' Robert
Salas said. ``And that was one of the things wrong in the case. The
case was flawed from the beginning.''
   For District Attorney Ira Reiner, the case became an albatross.
It is believed to have cost him the Democratic nomination for state
attorney general.
   His predecessor, Robert Philibosian, who filed the original
McMartin case, called the outcome ``a political disaster'' for
Reiner.
   Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, has said he may leave the practice
of law and devote himself to helping children. He has called Buckey
``an American hero'' and ``the most courageous client I've ever had
the privilege of serving.''
   He said he would not file civil lawsuits against anyone on
Buckey's behalf.
   ``We've lost a lot of faith in the judicial system and I can
think of nothing worse than for my client to get involved in civil
litigation,'' he said.
   Buckey, who matured and gained confidence under the publicity
spotlight, now hopes to fade into anonymity.
   ``I would like to be just left alone,'' he said. ``I'd like to
move out of the city and find a little fresh air.''

<HEAD>United States, ASEAN Play Down Differences on Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its allies in
Southeast Asia are in general agreement on policy regarding
Cambodia even if they disagree on some specifics, Thailand's
foreign minister said Saturday.
   The Thai official, Siddhi Savetsila, said the ``fundamental
objectives'' of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the
United States on Cambodia are the same.
   ``We are at one on comprehensive political solution and we both
agree on the urgent need for the Cambodian supreme national council
to be established at the earliest opportunity,'' Siddhi said.
   He spoke at ASEAN's annual meeting with its largest trading
partners, the United States, Japan, Canada, the European Community,
Australia and New Zealand.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the meeting Friday
that ``we are drawn together by converging interests _ in matters
of security, economics, democracy and human rights.''
   When it comes to specifics, however, the United States and ASEAN
have not held identical positions on Cambodia.
   The ASEAN countries _ Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines,
Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia _ were jolted by Baker's
announcement earlier this month that the United States was
withdrawing its recognition of the U.N. seat held by the
three-member Cambodia resistance coalition.
   The coalition includes the Khmer Rouge, which is blamed for
killing hundreds of thousands of Cambodians when it ruled the
country from 1975-78. The Khmer Rouge, backed by China, now is the
strongest member of the resistance coalition.
   Baker said Washington would open talks with Vietnam, the main
backer of the Cambodian government in Phnom Penh, and possibly with
Phnom Penh itself to try to end the fighting.
   ASEAN organized the resistance coalition in 1982 with U.S.
support, and it has been the cornerstone of ASEAN policy toward
Cambodia since then.
   Baker said continued support for the coalition in the U.N.
General Assembly ``is only providing the Khmer Rouge diplomatic
cover for its military maneuvers.''
   The United States and ASEAN agree that a supreme national
council of individuals representing a broad spectrum of opinion
should be formed to hold Cambodia's U.N. seat and embody the
country's sovereignty until elections can be organized under U.N.
auspices.
   An earlier ASEAN plan would have the council comprise
representatives of the Communist Khmer Rouge and other members of
the coalition, non-Communist followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and anti-Communists under former Premier Son Sann, plus the Phnom
Penh government.
   Also at the ASEAN meeting, the European Commission announced it
would set up a comprehensive program for repatriation of
Indochinese refugees.
   The announcement said the program would help provide a safe and
orderly return for those who fled to crowded, makeshift camps. It
also said it would try to help improve conditions in Vietnam and
continue to help with costs for the camps in first-asylum countries.

   Nearly 400,000 Moslems make the
Caribbean their home, but most are East Indians who disdain the
radical politics of black Moslems like those who are holding
Trinidad's government hostage.
   Saturday, black Moslem Abu Bakr took over Parliament and
threatened to kill the prime minister and much of his Cabinet.
   Bakr is a fundamentalist who has developed strong support from
Trinidad's poor black community. His Jamaat al-Muslimeen sect has
an eight-acre commune in western Port-of-Spain, where more than 250
men, women and children live. There is a large mosque, day care
center, school and kitchens for the homeless.
   Bakr has close ties with Libya and has often stated that Islamic
principles must dominate society.
   But few East Indian Moslems support views like Bakr's and
tensions between Moslems of East Indian and African descent _ two
groups that rarely mix _ have been high.
   Many East Indians consider the black Moslems political
opportunists inspired more by the black power movement than by
traditional Islam. Stokely Carmichael, the black power advocate of
the 1960s in the United States, was born in Trinidad.
   Among the region's political leaders, prominent Moslems include
East Indian President Noor Hassanali of Trinidad and Prime Minister
Hamilton Green of Guyana, a black who converted to Islam in the
1960s.
   The first Moslems came to the region to work in the sugar cane
fields, either as black slaves in the 1700s or as indentured
servants from India 100 years later.
   Now domed mosques can be found on a dozen Caribbean islands, but
the heaviest concentrations of Moslems are on the islands of
Trinidad and Tobago and in Guyana and Suriname on the South
American mainland.
   ``One of the region's strongest religious trends today is the
movement toward Islam among blacks,'' says freelance writer Larry
Luxner, who lives in San Juan. In the last 20 years, many blacks
have converted to Islam.
   Luxner, who has written extensively on Moslems in the Caribbean,
estimates that Trinidad-Tobago and Suriname each have 100,000
Moslems and Guyana 120,000.
   Trinidad and Tobago is mostly a Hindu and Christian nation of
1.3 million people. About 6 percent of the population is Moslem,
with those of East Indian and African descent each make up 40
percent of the Moslem population.
   Writing in the Arabic magazine Aramco World in 1987, Luxner said
Trinidad had 85 mosques, Guyana 133 and Suriname, formerly Dutch
Guyana, 150. He said 25 percent of Suriname's 400,000 people were
Moslem, the highest percentage in any country in the Western
Hemisphere.
   There are also 2,500 Moslems in Puerto Rico, most of them
Palestinians who arrived between 1958 and 1962, Luxner said.

   A jury ordered Alamo Rent-A-Car
Inc. to pay a man $3 million for false arrest after the company
reported the car he had rented and returned as stolen.
   A Broward County Circuit Court jury awarded Dania businessman
Michael Mancusi $300,000 in compensatory damages and $2.7 million
in punitive damages Friday for malicious prosecution.
   ``The night I was standing in jail, I knew it was wrong,''
Mancusi said Saturday. ``Big corporations like this should not be
able to swoop down and sweep people off the streets and put them in
jail.''
   The case began when Mancusi rented an Oldsmobile Calais from the
Fort Lauderdale-based company for a week on July 15, 1986. He kept
the car longer but didn't think there would be a problem because he
had rented cars from Alamo before on a month-to-month basis.
   He said he received a letter demanding the car's return three
weeks later, and a company employee agreed to an extension over the
telephone.
   But Mancusi said he was called by a police detective Aug. 27 and
told the car had been listed on a ``hot sheet'' of stolen cars.
   He said he returned the car that same day.
   But on Sept. 2 an Alamo employee signed an auto-theft arrest
affidavit and Mancusi was taken to jail 14 days later.
   During booking, Mancusi's name was spelled incorrectly on jail
records, leaving him in limbo behind bars when relatives tried to
bail him out because there was no record of him under the correct
spelling.
   He spent a total of 28 hours behind bars and was subjected to
two rectal examinations for contraband.
   The case went to trial in February 1987, but after it was
explained in court the judge ordered prosecutors to drop the
charges.
   Alamo attorney Bob Merchin blamed police and prosecutors for
proceeding with the criminal case.
   ``Michael Mancusi may have suffered some indignities, but that
was not the fault of Alamo,'' Merchin said.
   Mancusi, who owns a company that makes commercials and corporate
and travel videos, didn't see it that way and pressed his civil
case.
   ``Obviously it's a nice award, but I spent a lot of time in
jail, and I had a lot of anguish between the time of the arrest and
trial, so I thought it was a very fair award,'' he said.
   ``I don't rent from Alamo any more,'' he added.

<HEAD>Governors Angered Over Bush Administration Proposal on Tax
Deductions</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New throughout with news conference, other updated material
^With AM-Education Goals Bjt</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The nation's governors gathered Saturday for
their annual summer meeting, voicing bipartisan opposition to a
Bush administration plan to limit deductibility of state income
taxes.
   ``The deductibility of state and local taxes should not be
further eroded,'' said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican and
chairman of the National Governors' Association.
   He said Republican and Democratic governors were united in
opposition the proposal by the Bush administration and
congressional Republicans to raise more federal revenue by reducing
the ability of taxpayers to deduct state and local tax payments
from their federal tax bill.
   Republicans were wary, however, of talk among Democratic
governors of offering a resolution or other statement condemning
the deepening savings and loan scandals and perhaps suggesting a
national commission of inquiry.
   ``We're viewing it as political positioning,'' said Michele
Davis, director of the Republican Governors Association.
   Anticipating a possible Democratic-led resolution on the
problem, Branstad said at a news conference that there was no need
for partisan finger-pointing on the S&amp;L issue _ but that there may
be regional blame.
   ``This is one farm state governor that resents having to pay the
bill for the high rollers in other states who were trying to line
their own pockets and help their buddies,'' Branstad said. ``And
it's both parties that have been involved in helping in this
effort, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense to point the
partisan finger.''
   Branstad said he was ``madder than hell about being asked to pay
for that because I went through the agriculture crisis in the
mid-80s. ... I had millions of people in my state that suffered
greatly. We didn't get a lot of sympathy through that time and I
don't like the idea of paying the bills for the extravagance of
those people involved in the S&amp;L crisis.''
   The first official session of the governors' annual meeting was
Sunday. The host city of Mobile placed metal crowd-control
barricades along downtown sidewalks in case of protests, though few
were expected, and the city planted new palm trees along the route
from the airport.
   The governors planned to discuss a wide range of issues before
their meeting ends Tuesday, including a report on implementing the
education goals they agreed on with President Bush last fall.
   Democratic governors met privately Saturday in nearby
Pascagoula, Miss., in a home overlooking the Gulf of Mexico.
Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said the Democrats were
trying to reach a position on a S&amp;L policy.
   The governors stated their opposition to the latest proposal on
taxes in a letter to the administration before the meeting.
   The bipartisan National Governors' Association has a
longstanding policy against such a move, spokeswoman Rae Bond said.
   The governors argue that limiting or eliminating deductibility,
in addition to raising federal taxes for individuals who itemize
their deductions, would make it more difficult for states to raise
additional revenues to provide new services _ and might lead to
increased pressure to lower state and local taxes.
   The governors also dislike any proposals to raise federal excise
taxes, viewing that as an infringement on state and local tax bases.
   ``The governors are very apprehensive about anything that would
reduce the flexibility of states to be able to deal with their own
situation in terms of revenue sources that are traditionally the
states','' Branstad said.
   A group of Northeastern governors sent a letter of their own to
federal budget negotiators saying the move would cause the federal
income tax to become ``a tax on a tax,'' and would especially hit
Northeastern states, where 18 percent of the national population
pays 30 percent of all state and local personal and property taxes.
   ``It would strike especially hard at middle- and working-class
families,'' they said. ``As a region, the Northeast is already
suffering from the disproportionate impact of the savings and loan
bailout.''
   The tax idea emerged late last week from negotiations on a
federal budget solution. Under the GOP plan, the currently
unlimited deduction for state and local taxes would be limited to
$10,000. Administration officials estimated the plan would generate
$3 billion a year in federal revenue.
   In addition, federal budget negotiators are discussing raising
the federal excise tax on beer and other alcoholic beverages,
generating $7.2 billion.
   Several Democratic governors were considering offering proposals
on the savings-and-loan costs, including Richard Celeste of Ohio,
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   One plan circulated by Wilder would call for a national
commission to investigate the collapse of savings and loans that
threaten to cost federal taxpayers as much as $300 billion or more
in bailout costs.
   On education, a disagreement emerged over the makeup of a
commission that would issue report cards on how states are doing in
meeting their education goals. An administration plan to have four
seats each named by the administration, the governors and Congress
would leave it dominated 8 to 4 by Republicans and was being
opposed by Democrats, who feared it could become a partisan weapon.
   ``That has been a very sensitive area,'' Branstad acknowledged.
   Clinton said House Speaker Tom Foley and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell have written the governors suggesting the
commission be established by an act of Congress. Clinton said the
governors hadn't decided on a response. ``I'd say we'll all get a
bad grade, or somebody will get a bad grade, if this report card
business isn't up and running pretty soon after this meeting,''
Clinton said.

   The Bush administration's proposal to increase
taxes on alcoholic beverages would cost the average American family
$101 a year, with the greatest burden falling on the poor,
congressional analysts say.
   The proposal, which would cost drinkers $7.2 billion a year, is
part of the second deficit-reduction tax increase offered by the
administration this year. The new package has yet to be agreed to
by Republican congressional leaders _ let alone by top Democrats _
who are trying to negotiate deficit cuts of more than $50 billion
for next year.
   Under the proposal, the $1.98 federal tax on a fifth of 80-proof
vodka would rise to $2.54. For the first time in almost 40 years,
taxes on beer and wine would be raised as well, so that an ounce of
drinking alcohol would be taxed at 25 cents, regardless of the form.
   That would boost the 16-cent tax on a six-pack of beer to 81
cents and the 3-cent tax on table wine to 76 cents. The tax on
other forms of wine, which is based on alcohol content, would go up
accordingly.
   Analysts say the impact would be felt most by those with the
lowest incomes, simply because they tend to spend a greater share
of their earnings on alcohol than do the more affluent.
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 20 percent of
Americans with the lowest incomes (averaging $8,228 after taxes)
spend $308 a year or 3.7 percent on liquor, wine and beer. The top
one-fifth, with after-tax incomes averaging $77,622, spend about
$1,210, or 1.6 percent.
   A second new element of the administration plan would target
upper-income Americans. For the first time, it would limit the
federal deduction for state and local income taxes _ to $10,000 per
couple or individual _ and raise up to $3 billion a year.
   Figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation indicate that the
86 percent of taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 a year would pay
only 0.2 percent of that tax increase. Couples and individuals in
the $50,000-to-$75,000 range would pay 0.5 percent; those between
$75,000 and $100,000, 1.9 percent; and those making $100,00 to
$200,000 would pay 11.2 percent of the increase.
   Those earning more than $200,000 would pay 86.2 percent of the
$3 billion.
   Anything falling so disproportionately on the well-to-do usually
is inclined to be endorsed by Democrats, but not this idea. It
didn't take long for them to figure out that limiting the deduction
of income taxes would make it more difficult for states to raise
those taxes.
   The nation's governors condemned the plan. Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors'
Association, said Saturday ``The deductibility of state and local
taxes should not be further eroded.''
   Branstad, speaking in Mobile, Ala., at the governors' annual
summer meeting, said governors of both parties were united in
opposition to the proposal.
   Forty-one states have a personal income tax; in most, it is the
prime source of revenue.
   The IRS has no current estimate on how many couples and
individuals claim a deduction of over $10,000 for state and local
income taxes. However, on returns filed in 1989, the 46 percent of
taxpayers who itemized deductions claimed a writeoff averaging only
about $3,800 for income and property taxes combined. The proposal
would not affect the deduction of property taxes.
   While the well-to-do would have to swallow most of that $3
billion tax increase, as a group they would come out ahead when the
entire administration package is considered.
   That is because the most contentious element of the plan is the
same as when President Bush sent it to Congress last January: a
reduction in the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the
sale of stock and other investments.
   Bush contends the reduction would prompt so much economic
activity that investors actually would pay $4.9 billion more in
taxes in 1991 and still more in ever year in the future.
   Democrats agree the cut would boost collections in one year but
say it quickly would become a drain on the treasury. But their
opposition is rooted in another factor: More than 80 percent of the
tax cut would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   About half the $50 billion-plus deficit reduction proposed by
the administration for next year would come from tax increases,
including user fees, and the cut in capital-gains taxes.

<HEAD>Moscow's Gorky Street Renamed Tverskaya Street, Its Old Monicker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gorky Street, Moscow's main thoroughfare that in
pre-revolutionary days was home to fashionable shops and stores,
will be given back its old name of Tverskaya Street, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The decision to give the street back the name it had since the
15th century follows similar moves throughout the Soviet Union.
   Cities, streets, ships, farms and factories that were renamed
for Bolshevik and other Soviet figures earlier this century are
being given back their old names, to the delight of local residents.
   The newspaper Izvestia reported that the decision to rename
Gorky Street was made by the Moscow City Council, which is headed
by radical reformers. The City Council's headquarters is on the
street.
   Tverskaya Street was renamed Gorky Street in 1932, after Russian
socialist writer Maxim Gorky.
   The street, which runs westward from the Kremlin, has been an
important route for centuries _ leading to the ancient town of
Tver, which in 1931 was renamed Kalinin, for Mikhail Kalinin, one
of Josef Stalin's henchmen. On July 19, Kalinin was given back its
old name of Tver.
   Tverskaya Street once was narrow and twisting, but in the 1930s
was made into a broad boulevard. Once the site of fabulous stores
in pre-revolutionary days, it now is lined by huge, bland office
buildings, including the massive Central Telegraph Office.
   Also on the street is the Gastronom No. 1 food store, formerly
called the Yeliseyevsky Store, as well as the offices of Izvestia.
   Cosmetics queen Estee Lauder opened a boutique on the street
earlier this year, and a Pizza Hut franchise is scheduled to open
there soon.
   The street runs by Pushkin Square, which is home to the first
McDonald's restaurant in the Soviet Union.

Judge E. Albert Morrison walked up to his desk Thursday and plopped
a package on the counter.
   ``He walks up and ... says `I'm Judge Morrison. I received this
package at home and I'm suspicious of it,''' Davidson said.
   ``My heart just stopped,'' Davidson said, thinking of recent
bomb attacks against judges elsewhere in the country. ``The judge
said, `I wanted it checked out.'''
   Police evacuated nearby police administrative offices and

<DATELINE>ABILENE, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan honored
another White House resident, Dwight Eisenhower, saying his
predecessor was largely responsible for the wave of democracy now
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Standing on the porch of the white wood-frame home where
Eisenhower lived as a boy, Reagan told a crowd of about 7,000
people in sweltering heat Friday that Eisenhower's philosophy and
values were drawn from the open fields of Kansas.
   ``President Eisenhower did not live to see such changes (in
Europe), but he knew they were coming. He set them in motion,''
said Reagan, referring to his fellow Republican's policies in the
early days of the Cold War.
   As a statesman, he said, Eisenhower took broad measures to make
a freer, more peaceful world.
   Before his speech, Reagan laid a wreath on Eisenhower's grave.
After making his remarks, he toured a display called ``White House
Treasures,'' which features more than 300 pieces of presidential
memorabilia.
   Reagan's visit to Abilene, the town Eisenhower called home, was
part of the celebration of Eisenhower's 100th birthday. Although
Eisenhower left Kansas, the state never left him, Reagan said.
   ``Ike's Abilene was a state of mind and a set of values, first
learned in this simple white frame house,'' Reagan said.
``Eisenhower remembered Abilene as a leveling ground where bank
accounts counted for little and bloodlines for even less.''
   Eisenhower lived in the house shaded by a hackberry tree from
the late 19th century until 1911, when he left for West Point. He
is buried in a nearby chapel, in an $80 regulation Army coffin.
   Reagan was introduced by President Bush's chief spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, a native of Abilene.
   Two other former presidents have confirmed plans to visit
Abilene during the Eisenhower Centennial, which ends Oct. 14.
Gerald Ford is scheduled to speak on relations between the
president and Congress on Aug. 20, and Richard Nixon will speak
about the end of the Cold War during an appearance Sept. 8.

   States should move away from the arbitrary
grouping of students by age, governors said Saturday in a report
that criticizes ``assembly line'' teaching.
   The recommendation is one of several in the report being offered
at the National Governors' Association's annual meeting in Mobile,
Ala. The report outlines the strategy for meeting the educational
goals endorsed by President Bush and the governors in late February.
   The strategy was developed by the NGA Task Force on Education,
co-chaired by Govs. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Carroll Campbell
of South Carolina.
   ``Despite all the effort that has been made in the decade of the
'80s to invest more money, start new programs and raise standards,
we still face a crisis,'' Clinton said in Mobile, Ala., where the
governors gathered to open their annual conference.
   ``We are still a long way from meeting these goals. ... We still
haven't made fundamental and dramatic changes in the very design
and structure of the education system,'' Clinton said.
   ``But we first have to face the fact that we still have problems
with the attitudes of the citizens whose votes and opinions ...
will determine whether we can make the changes we must make.''
   The proposals will be discussed this week at the governors
plenary session.
   The task force report criticized elementary and secondary
schools for assigning students based on where they live, grouping
them according to age and narrowly defined ability, and offering
them curriculum and textbooks that are ``fragmented and
repetitive.''
   The present system requires too many teachers who focus
``largely on the mastery of discrete, low-level skills and isolated
facts,'' the report said. By doing so, the report says, the system
denies opportunities ``for students to master subject matter in
depth, learn more complex problem-solving skills, or apply the
skills they do learn.''
   ``This arrangement was designed to prepare a work force destined
for the assembly lines of the industrial age,'' the report says.
   The task force suggested that states rely on practices that
``expand rather than limit access to learning opportunities'' for
low-achieving students, said the report.
   The report noted that ``age grading and fixed school years''
could be detrimental to those preschool and younger children not
making adequate progress.
   States should consider other approaches such as upgraded early
primary programs, multi-age grouping or summer programs that allow
children to progress at their own rate and still meet performance
standards, said the report.
   Other specific recommendations include placing top priority on
developing new tools for assessing student performance.
   The governors' report said that portfolios, essays, or other
open-ended problems that require students to synthesize, integrate,
and apply knowledge and data need to be developed as alternatives
to the exclusive use of conventional multiple-choice tests.
   The task force also asked states to conduct a statewide literacy
assessment and asked employers to audit the literacy and other
skills of their own employees.
   Shirley McBay, president of the Quality Education for Minorities
Network, praised the strategies and underscored the governors'
recommendation to eliminate tracking and ability grouping.
   ``They have recognized, as did we, that nothing short of
restructuring the nation's educational system will do and that a
holistic, coordinated approach is required,'' said McBay.
   The National Education Association a few weeks earlier called
for elimination of academic tracking, stressing that the practice
keeps underachievers down and lumps minorities into classes that
can prevent them from realizing their potential.
   The American Federation of Teachers, however, complained the
strategies fail to specify the role the federal government should
be playing in assisting the states.

   Warring Shiite Moslem militias fired
howitzers and multi-barrelled rocket launchers in south Lebanon on
Saturday. At least 16 combatants were killed and 42 wounded, police
said.
   Ambulances, sirens wailing, evacuated casualties from the
battleground in the southern Apple Province to hospitals in Sidon.
Security sources said many bodies could not be evacuated because of
the intensity of the fighting.
   The Red Cross pleaded with fundamentalist pro-Iranian Hezbollah
and the Syrian-backed Amal militia to abide by a four-hour ``mercy
cease-fire'' Sunday to remove the casualties.
   The Red Cross threatened to ``immediately withdraw from the
region'' if the cease-fire was not followed.
   Police could not establish who was winning ground in the latest
confrontation, which broke out at the Hezbollah-held village of
Kfar Milki, six miles southeast of Sidon.
   The fighting spread to Jarjou on the southwestern edge of
Hezbollah's enclave in the province, according to a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   Amal, in a statement, said its fighters controlled Jrinnaya
hill, which overlooks Kfar Milki on the northwestern edge of the
Hezbollah enclave and were advancing through the deserted village.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, said its fighters ``crushed four
attacks.''
   The fundamentalist group accused guerrillas of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization of ``direct involvement'' in the
attacks against its lines.
   Arafat has about 1,000 guerrillas manning a buffer that
separates Hezbollah's enclave from Amal-held territory.
   The Palestinian deployment has helped block an advance west
toward the Mediterranean coast and south toward the main Shiite
cities by the pro-Iranian group.
   Amal did not refer to the reported Palestinian involvement in
the fighting. The police spokesman said Arafat's guerrillas have
``sealed off'' the confrontation zone preventing policemen and news
reporters from monitoring combat developments.
   He said, however, that four dead Palestinian guerrillas and 27
wounded were evacuated from the Kfar Milki region to hospitals in
Sidon.
   ``The Palestinians are obviously involved in the fighting, but
we can't establish whether they are taking part in ground attacks
or just participating in the shelling duels with Hezbollah
gunners,'' the police spokesman said.
   PLO officials in Sidon and Palestinian refugee camps on the
outskirts of the port city refused to comment on the fighting
Saturday.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been locked in a three-year intermittent
confrontation for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's
largest sect.
   By police count, the power struggle has killed 1,202 Shiites and
wounded 4,131.
   Amal calls Hezbollah incursions into Apple Province an ``Iranian
invasion,'' charging that the 2,000-member Iranian Revolutionary
Guards contingent in Lebanon was involved.
   The command of the Revolutionary Guards contingent in Lebanon
broke its usual silence Saturday to defend its role in Lebanon,
saying it was only aimed at ``fighting the Zionists (Israel) and
defending the Moslems.''
   The statement, published by the leftist newspaper As-Safir,
called on Amal and Hezbollah to ``end the fighting among brethren
and unite your guns against the Zionist enemy.''
   The Iranian troops came to Lebanon with the declared objective
of taking part in confronting Israel's invasion in 1982. They set
up headquarters in the east Lebanon's town of Baalbek and have
since trained most of Hezbollah's fighters.
   In another development, the government of President Elias Hrawi
announced Saturday it will take ``the proper measures'' to end a
rebellion by Gen. Michel Aoun. He leads a rival administration in
the country's Christian enclave.
   The government's statement, issued after a four-hour Cabinet
meeting, did not elaborate. Beirut newspapers predicted the
government steps include the imposition of an economic blockade of
that part of the Christian enclave controlled by Aoun.
   Aoun, the former army commander, battled Syrian forces last year
in an unsuccessful effort to drive them from Lebanon. That fighting
left at least 900 people dead and 3,000 wounded.
   Earlier this year, Aoun's soldiers battled a rival Christian
militia for control of the country's Christian enclave. Those
battles ended in a standoff.

<HEAD>Sharon Steel Corp. Settles With Posner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miami financier Victor Posner will pay Sharon
Steel Corp. $7.5 million to settle legal actions against him by the
company and its creditors, a federal court officer said.
   The case between Posner and Sharon Steel, with assets of at
least $500 million, was the second-largest trusteeship case in the
nation.
   F.W. Agnew, the bankruptcy court trustee overseeing Sharon
Steel's reorganization, announced the tentative agreement with
Posner on Friday.
   Besides paying the $7.5 million, Posner will relinquish his
controlling share of stock in the company and he and his affiliated
companies will give up claims of $55 million against Sharon Steel.
   ``He is giving up all ownership claims and every interest
whatsoever,'' Larry Palmer, chief counsel to the trustee, said
Saturday.
   Posner was chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Sharon Steel until he was ousted during the company's bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The creditors said Posner mismanaged the company and drained its
assets. Among other things, they charged that he used $4.4 million
of Sharon Steel money to pay his legal fees in a federal tax
evasion trial in Florida, in which he was convicted in September
1987.
   ``The value of the settlement is not only the money but in
making him go away,'' Palmer said of Posner.
   He said court action could have taken years.
   A spokeswoman for Posner did not immediately return a phone call
for comment.
   The tentative agreement was reached Wednesday in Pittsburgh in a
hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Donald Ziegler, according
to Agnew, who was involved in the negotiations.
   It must be approved in a joint hearing with Ziegler and U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Warren Bentz, to be scheduled in late
September, Agnew said.
   According to Palmer, the case involving Sharon Steel was the
second largest trusteeship case next to the Eastern Airlines case.
   Sharon Steel filed in 1987 for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws and a trustee was
appointed.
   ``It was an economic shambles when we took over,'' Palmer said.
   Posner's affiliated companies, DWG Corp., NVF Co., Pennsylvania
Engineering Corp. and their subsidiaries and affiliates, joined in
the agreement, Palmer said.
   In May, a New York investors group filed a plan to bring Sharon
Steel out of bankruptcy proceedings.
   The investors, the New York merchant bank Castle Harlan Inc. and
Quantum Fund, an investment fund, said they plan to contribute $65
million to the company's pension plan, which would eliminate all
back payments required by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
   Howard Clark, president of Local 1197 of the United
Steelworkers, said Saturday that 2,200 workers at Sharon Steel in
Farrell have a tentative contract with Castle Harlan.
   The contract would take effect if the investors group is allowed
to buy and reorganize Sharon Steel, he said.

<HEAD>Rain From Rockies To East Coast, Flooding In Upper Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms spread rain from the Rockies to the East Coast on
Saturday, with locally heavy rain causing flooding in the Upper
Midwest.
   Many streams in Iowa were running high from several days of
heavy rain.
   Some streams in the Cedar River basin of northeastern Iowa left
their banks Friday, leaving thousands of acres of farm land under
water.
   The West Fork of the Cedar River at Finchford reached flood
stage on Saturday, and was expected to crest Sunday at 15 to 16
feet, the National Weather Service said. The agency predicted that
would put 20,000 acres of farm land under water. Some residential
flooding was expected at Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Vinton.
   Three days of heavy rain also made rivers rise in south-central
Minnesota, the weather service said.
   Urban flooding was reported in the Glencoe area, southwest of
Minneapolis, where 3 to 5 inches fell Friday night, flooding many
basements, the agency said.
   A motel basement wall collapsed, but no injuries were reported.
   ``The water just started to seep in slowly and then faster and
faster and then the wall just gave way,'' said Glencoe police
officer Tom Draper. ``It's basically just a big hole in the wall.''
   The Crow River was expected to crest at Delano, west of
Minneapolis, on Monday about 1{ feet above flood stage.
   In Texas, the Rio Grande was near flood stage Saturday southeast
of Presidio and rising. A flood warning was in effect into Sunday
over the Big Bend of southwestern Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended over central and western
Montana, east-central Wyoming, southern South Dakota, Nebraska,
northern Kansas, Iowa, southern Minnesota and west-central
Illinois, with scattered precipitation over eastern Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread from southwestern Texas to
southeastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, along the Gulf of
Mexico coast and over northern and central Florida. Showers and
storms also extended over the South Carolina coast, eastern North
Carolina, southern Virginia, Delaware, Maryland and southern New
Jersey.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered over central
and northern New England.
   Miami hit a record high for the date of 94 degrees during the
early afternoon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees in Arcata, Calif., to 104 in Palm Springs, Calif.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 38 degrees in Gunnison, Colo.

   A homemade pipe bomb exploded Saturday
on a crowded Tel Aviv beach, killing a 17-year-old Canadian tourist
and injuring 19 people, including a 9-year-old boy, officials said.
   Tel Aviv police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said 13 Arabs were
detained on suspicion of planting the bomb, which had been hidden
in a beach bag.
   After the explosion, Israelis attacked several Arab bathers,
stoned Arab-owned cars and beat Arab workers in the beachfront
hotels.
   Ms. Gilad said seven Israelis were detained by police in
connection with the attacks.
   She also said additional police were being deployed near the
beaches to prevent further attacks on Arabs.
   Col. Bill Minis, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Tel
Aviv, identified the slain girl as Marnie Kimmelman of the suburban
Toronto township of Willowdale. He said she died after surgery at
Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital.
   Minis said she was on a tour sponsored by the Canadian Zionist
Federation.
   Bianka Ledderman, deputy director of Tel Aviv's Ichilov
hospital, said 18 other people, including three other Canadian
girls, were treated for slight injuries and released.
   The 20th victim, a 9-year-old boy, was brought into another Tel
Aviv hospital for treatment and was released.
   One witness at the beach said there was complete confusion after
the explosion.
   ``Suddenly I heard an explosion and people flew in all
directions, scared, in shock and not knowing what to do,'' said the
owner of a beach snack bar on Israel army radio.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Police Commissioner Yaakov Turner urged Israelis not to riot and
said increased Arab-Jewish tension was one of the goals of the
bombers.
   ``The intention of the bomb-setters is exactly that, not only to
injure, but to create such rioting between Jews and Arabs,'' Turner
said on Army radio.
   Turner urged Israelis to be more vigilant to prevent attacks.
   ``We have special broadcasts that explain to the public what
they have to do, that they have to be aware and suspicious of
everything,' Turner said on Army radio. ``People have to be aware
of what is going on around them. Hopefully in this way we will
limit injuries.''
   Saturday's attack was the first since July 1, when a letter bomb
exploded inside a staircase mail box in downtown Jerusalem. Three
people were slightly injured in that attack.
   Since May, a rash of bomb attacks have spread throughout the
country.
   The most serious of the recent attacks was on May 28, when a
bomb exploded at Jerusalem's Ben-Yehuda market. It killed one
Israeli and injured nine other people.
   That attack was claimed by two Palestinian groups, the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad and a Syrian-backed dissident
Palestine Liberation Organization faction.
   In the occupied territories Saturday, six Palestinians _
including a 13-year-old _ were wounded in clashes with Israeli
soldiers.
   A total of 724 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians in the 31-month uprising against Israeli occupation.
At least 242 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most as
suspected collaborators. Forty-five Israelis also have been killed.

<HEAD>Navy Lieutenant Receives Seven-Year Sentence for Rape on Ship</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROTA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military judge sentenced a U.S. Navy
lieutenant to seven years in prison Saturday after convicting him
of raping a female officer aboard ship at a Spanish port.
   The judge, Capt. Thomas A. Lawrence, also dismissed Lt. j.g.
Robin E. Brown, 27, of Rawlins, Wyo., from the Navy.
   Lawrence said he hoped the sentence would express the naval
community's ``moral outrage and indignation'' that such a sexual
attack could take place against one of its female officers.
   Navy officials in Spain said they could recall no previous case
in which a male officer had been accused of raping a female
officer. They said cases of shipboard rape are extremely rare.
   ``I think the judge did a good job of letting it be known that
this won't be allowed in the Navy _ on ships or anywhere else,''
said the rape victim, who stressed that she did not hold the Navy
responsible for what happened. The Navy has withheld the woman's
name and rank to protect her privacy.
   Brown's defense attorneys said they planned to appeal his
conviction and sentence.
   He was accused of raping the female officer on April 4 aboard
the USS Suribachi while the ammunition ship was docked in
Cartagena, Spain. Prosecutors said the rape occurred after Brown
and the victim had gone drinking in town with fellow officers from
the ship.
   On Friday, the judge found Brown guilty of one count of rape
under the military code of justice. Defense lawyers chose to have
the judge hear the case rather than a jury of six officers.
   The judge accepted the prosecution's contention that Brown
returned to the ship drunk and entered the woman's stateroom,
getting into her bed while she was asleep and initiating sexual
intercourse.
   Brown, who is married and has a 1-year-old daughter, did not
testify during the weeklong trial, but took the stand Saturday at
his sentencing hearing.
   He said he believed he committed the crime, should be punished,
and apologized to the victim.
   ``I'm very sorry for all the harm I caused your family,'' said
Brown. ``I'm very ashamed of what I've done. I never intended to
harm anybody. I wish you guys could forgive me.''
   In her testimony Saturday, the victim said she and her family
had suffered deep anguish as a result of the rape.
   ``He violated me physically,'' she said. ``I was in my
stateroom, which is my home. And I should be left alone there. If I
can't sleep in my own bed, where can I be left alone?''
   Brown's defense attorney, Marine Capt. J.H. Drescher, admitted
that Brown had sexual intercourse, but said his client was drunk at
the time and may have believed the female officer had indicated her
consent while semiconscious by making a gesture to encourage Brown.
   At the sentencing hearing, Drescher asked for a one-year
sentence, telling the judge that Brown is `not an evil man ...
(but) he was too weak to say `no.'''
   The prosecutor, Marine Capt. Walter Sharp, asked for a prison
sentence of 12 to 15 years, saying Brown had committed an act of
``selfish self-gratification.''
   Brown displayed no emotion as the judge declared the sentence.
He will receive reduced pay during his confinement and lose all pay
and benefits upon his release.
   Brown's trial has drawn attention because complaints of sexual
harassment and discrimination in the Navy have increased in recent
years as the number of women enlistees has grown from 9,000 in 1972
to the current 64,000.
   The service has come under particular scrutiny after a female
midshipman resigned in April from the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., after she was handcuffed to a urinal and
photographed by some male classmates in a hazing incident in
December.
   The incident prompted the academy's superintendent to institute
a new program of sensitivity training for midshipmen that focuses
on sexual harassment and equal opportunity for women.
   Brown will be held in the brig at the joint U.S.-Spanish naval
station in Rota before being transferred to a military prison in
the United States.

<HEAD>Cuban Asylum-Seekers Abandon Italian Mission In Havana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Cuban asylum-seekers left the Italian
ambassador's residence in the Cuban capital after President Fidel
Castro promised not to prosecute refugees who fled to diplomatic
compounds there, news reports said Saturday.
   During a speech Thursday, Castro said no asylum seeker who had
entered a foreign embassy by force would be granted permission to
leave the Caribbean island. But he also guaranteed that asylum
seekers who abandoned the diplomatic missions in Havana would not
be prosecuted.
   The four reported to leave Friday had occupied the Italian
envoy's residence since July 17. They departed Friday of their own
free will, according to Mexican news services reporting from Havana.
   Beginning July 9, dozens of asylum-seekers entered the Swiss,
Czech, Spanish and Italian diplomatic missions in Havana.
   The surge of refugees has put Communist Cuba at odds with the
United States and Spain, once the island's colonial ruler. Castro
has claimed the United States instigated the crisis, and U.S.
officials have denied the charge.
   The Spanish Embassy's trade representative, Ignacio Ruperez,
told reporters in Havana that the example of the asylum seekers who
left the Italian diplomatic mission was a good precedent for those
remaining in his country's embassy, said the Mexican news agency
Notimex.
   The asylum-seekers who abandoned the Italian ambassador's house
were driven back to their homes by embassy personnel, the
independent Mexican news agency Excelsior reported.
   It said they ranged in age from 20 to 25 and were unemployed.
Excelsior quoted them as asking to be excused for the problems
their actions had created.

   A program to let poor Milwaukee public
school pupils enroll in private schools at state expense could
disrupt the racial balance in the state's largest school system, an
attorney argued in court Saturday.
   Patrick McDonnell, an assistant city attorney for Milwaukee,
told a Dane County Circuit Court judge that the state's school
choice program could ``cause the entire Milwaukee public schools
system to become more rather than less segregated.''
   But an attorney representing six parents and six of the private
schools favoring the program said school choice creates a new
educational opportunity and gives parents more control over their
children's education.
   Judge Susan Steingass heard testimony from about a half-dozen
attorneys in two lawsuits against the program, which is scheduled
to start next month.
   Under the program, the first of its kind in the nation, the
state would provide $2,500 per pupil for low-income families who
want to transfer a child from the Milwaukee public schools to a
non-sectarian private school. It was approved in April and signed
into law by Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson.
   The primary lawsuit, on which Judge Steingass is expected to
rule next week, claims the program is unconstitutional for
providing state dollars to private schools.
   It was filed against the state by the Wisconsin Education
Association Council, Wisconsin's largest teachers union. The union
is among several education groups that oppose the program along
with State Superintendent Herbert Grover, saying it undermines
public education because private schools cannot be held as
accountable as public schools.
   ``What the Legislature did is ignore 25 years of history of
desegregating Milwaukee Public Schools,'' McDonnell said,
contending the exodus of students in some areas could upset the
ratios of white and black students in the city's federally-ordered
desegregation plan.
   Robert Friebert, representing the Milwaukee chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
three statewide school groups, said the Legislature failed to
include in the law means for the state to monitor the progress of
the program's pupils.
   ``You can't have the public funds without the public controls''
under the public purpose doctrine in the Wisconsin Constitution,
Friebert said.
   Landmark Legal Foundation Center attorney Clint Bolick, whose
Washington-based group is representing the parents and private
schools, said the school choice plan creates a new educational
opportunity, which the Legislature is allowed to do under the state
constitution.
   ``It transfers power in the area of public education from the
educational establishment to the parents,'' Bolick said.
   The plan was a step in equalizing educational opportunities for
poor pupils with those of wealthier pupils, Bolick said.
   Warren Weinstein, an assistant attorney general representing the
state, said it was not unconstitutional for the program to receive
state funding.
   Weinstein said the law calls for scrutiny by Superintendent
Grover and an audit by the Legislative Audit Bureau by 1995.
   The second lawsuit, filed by Landmark Legal Foundation against
Grover, claimed the school superintendent was illegally trying to
force private schools in the program to meet complex and strict
requirements not spelled out in the law.

   The White House expressed ``strong
support'' Saturday for Trinidad's prime minister, a captive of
black Moslem rebels who took over the Caribbean island's parliament.
   President Bush was spending the weekend relaxing at his
oceanfront summer home here, but he and national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft were kept abreast of the attempted coup, a
spokeswoman said.
   Bush, who spent the morning on the tennis courts and boating,
attended the wedding of a second cousin in late afternoon.
   Deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said Bush and Scowcroft were
``following the situation carefully'' in Trinidad and Tobago, a
former British colony off the coast of Venezuela that gained
independence in 1962.
   ``We maintain our strong support for the Democratic government
of Prime Minister (Arthur) Robinson,'' Ms. Glen said.
   ``It appears that no American citizens are in any danger. The
situation seems limited to one building,'' she said.
   Trinidad and Tobago have not yet asked for help, but the United
States would consider the request if they do, she said.
   Robinson and several members of his cabinet were being held
hostage in the parliament in Port-of-Spain by rebels led by former
policeman Abu Bakr, leader of a Moslem sect that said it recognizes
no government but ``the law of almighty Allah.''
   Later, the State Department issued this written statement:
   ``We condemn yesterday's attempt by a violent extremist group to
overthrow the democratic government of Trinidad and Tobago. We call
upon the parties in this attempted coup to release the hostages
under their control and to surrender to the legislative
constitutional authority of Trinidad and Tobago. This violent
attack on the government has no support from the people of Trinidad
and Tobago who have enjoyed a long tradition of democratic
government. The United States fully supports the elected government
and is consulting closely with it and other interested governments
in the region.''
   An administration official who accompanied Bush to Maine said
the army was still loyal to the prime minister and his
four-year-old government.
   On another international hotspot, Liberia, Ms. Glen said, ``The
situation has not changed. We're following it closely.''
   The beleaguered government of President Samuel Doe has been
under siege for weeks in that West African nation. Rebel leader
Charles Taylor claimed Friday to have established his own
government, even though street fighting continued.
   Bush, getting a weekend respite from the drawn out negotiations
with Democrats over the budget deficit, brought his wife, Barbara,
daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and several grandchildren with him
Friday on the flight from Washington to Pease Air Force Base in
Newington, N.H.
   He also gave his taciturn Supreme Court nominee, David H.
Souter, a ride home to New Hampshire. Before heading off to visit
his mother at a Concord nursing home, Souter said it felt ``damn
good'' to be back in the Granite State.
   This was the Bushes' third visit to their vacation home since
Memorial Day.
   President and Mrs. Bush attended the wedding of a second cousin,
Ruben Andrus Holden V, 37, of Marshfield, Mass., to Pamela Anne
Grindle, 35, of Boston, at St. Ann's Episcopal Church in
Kennebunkport.
   The stone church, which overlooks the Atlantic, is where the
Bushes attend Sunday services. Guests were required to walk through
a portable metal detector.
   Mrs. Bush will stay behind when the president heads back to the
White House on Sunday evening. The president will return here to
Walker's Point on Aug. 10 and stay until Labor Day.

   A man who drank from a soft drink bottle containing
dissolved cocaine was in a coma Saturday while federal officials
discovered two other tainted bottles and checked possible links to
Colombian drug smugglers.
   Drug traffickers frequently smuggle cocaine by dissolving it in
liquids, officials said.
   Maximo Rene Menendez, 25, suffered convulsions and cardiac
arrest after drinking from a bottle of the Colombian soft drink
``Pony Malta de Bavaria'' that contained an unknown amount of
cocaine, said Jeanne Bush, acting supervisor of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration's Miami office.
   ``He had a very violent reaction,'' she said. ``He is gravely
ill.''
   Menendez was in critical condition at AMI-Kendall Regional
Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman Roxana Fernandez. She
said it was too early for a prognosis for Menendez, who was on a
respirator.
   ``Right now it looks better, but they really don't know what's
going to happen,'' she said.
   Eight 6.16-ounce bottles of the drink were taken from Manendez's
home in the Miami area, and tests performed at an FDA laboratory in
Atlanta found high concentrations of cocaine in two of them.
   One bottle contained 54 grams of dissolved cocaine and the other
had nearly 37 grams, said FDA spokeswoman Estela Brown. The other
bottles contained untainted beverage. The drink Pony Malta de
Bavaria is similar to a heavy non-alcoholic beer.
   It was not known how much cocaine Menendez had consumed, Ms.
Fernandez said. She said 25 milligrams would constitute a lethal
dose.
   Menendez noticed a strange taste to the drink after swallowing,
she said, telling his father ``there was poison in it and to take
him to the hospital.''
   After Menendez was stricken Thursday, the FDA ordered the drink
removed from the shelves of the Miami supermarket where he
purchased it.
   Additional tests on Pony Malta de Bavaria taken from the
supermarket and other stores are planned before a decision is made
on any further recall, said Ms. Brown.
   The drink is manufactured by Cerveceria Bavaria S.A., based in
Bogota, Colombia. Company president Augusto Lopez said Saturday the
drink is produced both there and in Barranquilla, Colombia, and is
shipped abroad by independent exporters.
   Lopez said he had no information about those exporters, adding
that the brewery has nothing to do with the drink once it is sold
in Colombia.
   Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan said cocaine smuggling in
liquid form is a common trick among drug traffickers.
   ``We've seen dozens of cases of liquefied cocaine,'' he said.
``We've seen cocaine dissolved in wine, water, all sorts of ways.''
   Sheehan said one smuggling ring filled clear plastic bags with a
cocaine solution and placed them inside larger bags of water
containing tropical fish from Latin America.
   Other traffickers have soaked towels and clothing in solutions
of cocaine, he said.

<HEAD>Report: AIDS Will Kill 3 Million Women, Children In 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 3 million women and children worldwide
will die of AIDS in the 1990s, a medical journal reported Saturday.
   The report, published in the London-based journal The Lancet,
said AIDS has become the leading cause of death for women ages 20
to 40 in many places, including New York City and central African
cities.
   ``In these cities, infant and child mortality could be as much
as 30 percent greater than what would otherwise have been
expected,'' the report said, which cited figures from the World
Health Organization.
   ``During the 1990s, not only can hundreds of thousands of
pediatric AIDS cases be expected, but also more than a million
uninfected children will be orphaned because their HIV-infected
mothers and fathers will have died from AIDS.''
   The HIV virus causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a
disease that attacks the body's immune system and leaves victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. There is
no known cure.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.
   The report in Lancet said Geneva-based WHO estimates that during
the 1980s, there were about 500,000 cases of AIDS in women and
children.
   ``During the 1990s, WHO estimates that the pandemic will kill an
additional 3 million or more women and children worldwide,'' the
report said.
   The report in The Lancet was written by WHO researcher James
Chin. He said the estimates cited had been developed by WHO's
Global Program on AIDS.
   Chin's report, entitled ``Current and Future Dimensions of the
HIV-AIDS Pandemic in Women and Children,'' gave no estimate of AIDS
deaths among males in the 1990s.
   But WHO last year estimated that a total of 6 million people
were likely to have AIDS worldwide by the year 2000.
   Saturday's report said that during the second half of the 1980s,
HIV infections among homosexual and bisexual men have shown a
decreasing trend in most areas of the world.
   ``By contrast there has been a slow but steady increase in HIV
infections among heterosexual populations: this trend has been most
pronounced in Latin America, especially in the Caribbean,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Anne Stanley says she fondly recalls her
four-year romance with U.S. Supreme Court nominee David Souter, a
man she describes as ``most comfortable in jeans and a flannel
shirt.''
   ``It was a typical young love, a wonderful romance,'' Stanley,
49, said recently. ``It was always understood that we were engaged
and we would marry one day.''
   But they drifted apart in 1963. The former Anne Grant married
David Stanley in 1965; Souter never married.
   Souter and Stanley started dating in the summer of 1959 when
they lived three miles apart in Weare, N.H., she said Friday. That
fall, she entered Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., about 12
miles from Harvard, where Souter was a junior.
   When Souter was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in
England, they wrote each other long letters and she visited once in
1963.
   ``He was unusually bright, honest, funny, witty, perceptive,
self-disciplined and a good listener,'' she said. ``All of those
good qualities have endured.''
   President Bush nominated Souter, 50, on Monday to replace
retired Justice William J. Brennan.
   Stanley said she sent a note to congratulate her former beau.
   No one answered the phone Saturday at Souter's home in New
Hampshire.
   Souter's mother, Helen Souter, said by telephone Saturday that
she remembered Anne Grant well.
   ``We were very fond of Anne,'' Mrs. Souter said. ``She's a
lovely person.''

   About 30 Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis
rallied and marched down this exclusive retreat's most famous
street Saturday to jeers from a crowd of about 1,000 people.
   The marchers, split between Klansmen and young neo-Nazis, walked
down Worth Avenue past royal palms, manicured hedges and pastel
shops, many of them closed.
   About 130 officers from six police departments, most in riot
gear and carrying batons, closely monitored the march in an area
that includes many survivors of the Nazi Holocaust.
   The 45-minute event proceeded with little incident, although the
presence of hoods, shaven heads and swastikas turned what had
seemed a typical blend of tourists, shoppers and rubberneckers into
a jeering mob.
   A spectator was arrested for disorderly conduct during the
march, said police spokesman Craig Gunkel. After the march, police
intervened when a group of people chased down a marcher and tried
to wrestle an American flag away from him.
   The crowd included legions of news photographers and reporters,
and police spent much of their energy controlling photographers,
several of whom complained they were struck.
   The city had tried to block the event, but the Klan won a July 2
ruling from U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger in West Palm Beach
allowing it. The march had been planned for July 4, but Klan
leaders said the ruling didn't give them time to organize it by
then.
   The march started almost an hour late after the white
supremacists seemed to have trouble gathering their troops.
   ``Many of them got lost,'' explained rally organizer Richard
Ford, a Klan wizard from Lantana.
   William ``Wild Bill'' Gandall, a Palm Beach County retiree with
an eye patch and crutches, tried to stop the march before it began.
He hobbled out and threw his body on the street, but was carted
off, asking for his heart medicine and muttering, ``I had to try to
stop it.''
   The symbols that brought the most anger were Nazi swastikas and
salutes, which infuriated older Jewish onlookers.
   ``This is a fringe, psychotic element preaching hate and
destruction,'' said Boca Raton retiree Stanley Winter.
   Wendell Baker, a 25-year-old black attending the rally, said he
was unhappy at the amount of exposure given the march, which he
described as a ``publicity stunt.''
   The marchers gathered at Memorial Fountain across from the
police station, shouting racial epithets, giving Nazi salutes and
castigating ``race traitors.''
   Ford defended the right of the neo-Nazis to be there with his
Fraternal White Knights and other Klan groups, but was almost
apologetic in an aside to reporters.
   ``They're more racist than we are,'' he explained, as young
jackbooted militants baited the jeering crowd.
   Walter and Pat Carlson, two of Ford's neighbors, attended the
rally and described him as ``a regular guy,'' friendly with
neighbors of all races.
   ``He's not the kind of guy looking to firebomb a church,'' said
Walter Carlson.
   In a statement issued Wednesday, the Klan said it was holding
the event in Palm Beach because the city ``has long been a symbol
of the power and influence of White Chrisitians and is now seeing
that culture subjugated by a vocal liberal-minority coalition.''
   A counterdemonstration in Palm Beach was scheduled Sunday by the
Rev. Thomas Masters of the New Macedonia Baptist Church in nearby
Riviera Beach and Jewish leader Lynn Kesselman.

<HEAD>Caribbean Leaders Condemn Coup Attempt, Consider Assistance</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trinidad, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caribbean leaders Saturday condemned
the attempted overthrow of the government of Trinidad and Tobago.
Jamaica and Barbados put their armies on alert in case Trinidad's
government asks for help.
   Several Caribbean heads of state and government officials were
in Jamaica to attend a summit of the Caribbean Economic Community.
The meeting starts Sunday.
   Trinidad Prime Minister Arthur N. Robinson, who has been held
hostage since Friday by black Moslem rebels in Port-of-Spain,
Trinidad's capital, is an influential figure within the community
and had planned to attend the summit.
   Trinidad and Tobago, with a population of 1.3 million, is the
second largest member after Jamaica in the 13-nation Caribbean
community, which groups 11 island nations as well as Guyana and
Belize.
   Percival J. Patterson, acting prime minister of Jamaica, said
his country's defense force was being readied in the event the
community was asked to provide military assistance.
   ``The army has been placed on full alert,'' Patterson said after
a meeting in Kingston with other Caribbean leaders who had arrived
early for the summit.
   Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of Barbados said his island
nation's army had also been placed on alert.
   ``Barbados supports democratic government, and where such
governments are overthrown or threatened by illegal means, we will
not support this,'' Sandiford said. ``If any request is made we
will consider assistance.''
   In Dominica, Prime Minister Eugenia Charles called for an end to
the takeover attempt.
   ``We cannot allow this nonsense,'' said Ms. Charles, who asked
for U.S. military intervention in Grenada in 1983 after a bloody
coup there.
   Troops from the Caribbean community provided token support for
the invading U.S. forces, which ousted the Marxist military junta
that took power after killing Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and
several government ministers.
   Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, also pledged
Saturday ``to render whatever assistance'' possible if Trinidad's
government asks for help from the Caribbean organization.
   Pindling did not indicate, however, whether his administration
was willing to consider military assistance.
   Trinidad's foreign minister, Sahadeo Basdeo, who had led a
delegation to pre-summit discussions in Kingston, said Saturday
afternoon that he would attempt to return home to assess the
situation.
   ``We are pleading with the rebels to free the prime minister and
to talk about their problems,'' Basdeo said. ``We are pleading for
common sense and rationality to prevail, and for a restoration of
democracy.''
   In Port-of-Spain, Acting Foreign Minister Edden Shand, who was
released by the rebels Saturday, made a statement on radio opposing
any foreign military intervention.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft were ``following the situation carefully,''
said deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   In Caracas, the Venezuelan government said it would not
recognize any rebel government in Trinidad and Tobago, a former
British colony of two islands which lies off Venezuela's coast.
   ``Venezuela ... energetically rejects this attempt to overthrow
the constitutional government,'' said the statement released
Saturday by the government news agency Venpres.
   Trinidad and Tobago is one of 48 members of the Commonwealth, an
association of Britain and its former colonies. In London, the
Commonwealth secretary general on Saturday called the attempted
coup ``unwelcome and unacceptable.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, another Commonwealth
member, called for the immediate release of Robinson and other
government hostages.

<HEAD>Ind. Judge Rules 2 Live Crew Album Obscene, Texas Prosecutors
Agree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indiana judge has ruled the 2 Live Crew album ``As Nasty as
They Wanna Be'' violates standards of decency and should not be
sold to minors, and Dallas prosecutors filed charges against two
store chains for selling the album.
   The million-selling album has already been ruled obscene by a
Florida judge and banned from record stores in San Antonio.
   In Indiana, Howard County Judge Randy G. Hainlen issued his
ruling late Friday after reviewing an affidavit submitted by
Prosecutor James D. Andrews and listening to the tape in his
chambers.
   A member of the prosecutor's staff purchased the cassette
Wednesday from a Karma Records Tapes Tickets store, which displayed
the tape on a shelf ``that is easily and readily accessible to
anyone who enters the store, including minors,'' the affidavit said.
   Entertainment Enterprises co-owner Dave Crockett, whose company
is the parent of 23 Karma Records stores in Indiana, said the
company has banned the sale of the 2 Live Crew tape to anyone under
18 since October.
   According to Andrews' affidavit, the album's ``lyrics are so
filled with explicit and detailed verbal descriptions or narrative
accounts of sexual excitement, or sexual conduct, along with timely
moaning and groaning that they violate contemporary community
standards of obscenity and are harmful to children.''
   In Texas, Dallas Assistant District Attorney David Pickett said
the lyrics of the rap album are obscene under the Texas penal code.
   ``We feel the record is obscene to adults as well as children,''
Pickett said at news conference Friday. ``We felt like we needed to
make a statement to these corporations.''
   Misdemeanor charges were filed against Sound Warehouse Inc. and
Hasting's Records and Tapes. Pickett said the offense will be the
sale, distribution and display of harmful materials to a minor. If
convicted, the retailers could be fined up to $10,000 each.
   Sound Warehouse president Terry Worrell said the company wasn't
aware that it carries any product which has been deemed obscene by
the district attorney's office. No one was available for comment at
Hastings corporate headquarters in Amarillo.
   Pickett said investigators successfully sent a 13-year-old boy
into a Sound Warehouse to buy the record. Undercover investigators
have also bought the album from both stores in recent weeks,
Pickett said.
   Pickett, who is running for district judge, said he isn't
worried about anyone thinking his move is a political one. He also
said he realized that the publicity may ultimately benefit the
group.
   A planned 2 Live Crew concert in Dallas earlier this month
turned violent after the show's promoter reneged and failed to pay
the group before they went on stage. Angry patrons threw chairs and
knocked out windows at the Longhorn Ballroom.
   San Antonio police last month arrested a record store owner for
selling the album. He pleaded innocent this week to promotion of
obscenity.
   In June, two members of 2 Live Crew were arrested in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., after they performed songs from the album.

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's a brief look at pertinent
facts about Mongolia:
   GEOGRAPHY _ Mongolia is a landlocked country of about 600,000
square miles of rolling grassland and mountains. Its highest point
is in the Altai Mountains in the west, which rise 14,420 feet.
Average rainfall is only eight inches a year, with the Gobi Desert
in the south getting as little as 2.4 inches.
   PEOPLE _ Mongolia's population was estimated at 2 million in
1988. Most are ethnic Mongols but a tiny minority are Khazak,
Russian and other minorities. One quarter of Mongolians live in the
capital city, Ulan Bator, and half live in rural areas, mostly
engaged in herding. Few true nomads remain but many people are
semi-nomadic, moving with their herds between winter and summer
camps.
   HISTORY _ Genghis Khan united the scattered, nomadic Mongol
tribes in the 13th century and turned them into a conquering horde.
At its peak, the Mongol empire he founded claimed territory from
the Danube River in Europe to China's Pacific coast. The Manchus
ousted the Mongols as rulers of China in 1691. The Mongols ruled
Mongolia until 1921. A small band of revolutionaries aided by
Soviet troops revolted that year and proclaimed an independent
socialist state in northern, or Outer Mongolia. The southern party,
Inner Mongolia, remained part of China. Mongolia remained in the
Soviet bloc and began its recent moves toward political and
economic reform only after Moscow did.
   ECONOMY _ The economy centers around herding and developing
natural resources such as copper, molybdenum and timber. With 25
million head of livestock, Mongolia exports wool, leather and meat.
Less than 1 percent of the land is cultivated. The economy is
centrally planned and major industries are state-subsidized.
Mongolia receives substantial aid and investment from the Soviet
Union but in April 1990 approved a joint venture law intended to
encourage investment from Japan and the West.
   GOVERNMENT _ After nearly seven decades of monopoly, the
Communists bowed to popular demonstrations earlier this year and
legalized other parties. However, the Communist Party, formally
called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, has 98,000
members and far outnumbers the opposition. The second-largest party
is the Mongolian Democratic Party with a declared membership of
7,200. The Communists have promised to stop receiving state funds
but retain cells in the army and police force.

   Voters on foot and horseback flocked
to the polls Sunday to vote in this Soviet-bloc country's first
multiparty elections that will decide the pace of democratic and
free-market reforms.
   At High School No. 1 in Ulan Bator, election officials showed
observers from various parties that the ballot boxes were empty
when voting began. They then used string and sealing wax to secure
the boxes.
   Voters, most wearing the traditional Mongolian herders' dress,
began arriving just after the polls opened at 7 a.m.
   ``From the start it is going quite well,'' said Amarbayasgolam,
an observer from the Mongolian Democratic Party, the largest
opposition party. Two British election observers also were on hand
among 19 from various countries.
   Five new parties are challenging the ruling Communists, formally
known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, in the
elections for the national, provincial and local legislatures.
   The Communists, who have held power in this remote Central Asian
nation since 1921, are assured control of the national legislature,
the 430-seat Great People's Hural, after winning a primary election
July 22. The opposition parties only have 130 candidates still in
the running out of an original 338.
   But the opposition hopes to win in the new 53-seat Small Hural,
which will meet between the Great Hural's annual sessions and have
considerable power. Its seats will be allocated to parties
according to the results of a party preference poll that is
included on Sunday's ballot.
   At stake are the speed and boldness of political and economic
reforms, which street demonstrations last winter and spring forced
the Communists to accept.
   By agreeing to free elections, the ruling party added Mongolia
to the list of Soviet-bloc nations experimenting with democracy.
Though the reform movement has swept through Eastern Europe,
Mongolia is the first Asian Communist state to hold multiparty
elections.
   However, the opposition has accused the Communists of only
paying lip-service to reform in order to stay in power. They and
ordinary Mongolians also have complained that the election is not
fair because greater weight is given to rural votes, expected to
favor the Communists. They also complain that nominations were made
before all the parties were able to register.
   In the election district where High School No. 1 is located,
however, the Mongolian Democratic Party's candidate, a 31-year-old
rock star, is favored to win a Great Hural seat. Tsogtsaikhan, a
singer and guitarist for the group Honkh, finished first in the
primary in that district.
   Chultemtsuren, a 75-year-old retired official who wore World War
II medals, said he voted for the rock star. Asked why he didn't
vote for the Communist candidate, he said, ``I worry about the
future of the country, that's why I vote for a younger man.''
   Chultemtsuren, like most Mongolians, uses only one name.
   Mongolia's generally low-key campaign went into high gear on
Saturday as candidates made the rounds nationwide in a final effort
to get out the vote.
   More than 4,000 youths rallied in the evening in front of the
Lenin Museum in Ulan Bator to cheer candidates for the Mongolian
Democratic Party and listen to Honkh and other rock groups.
   ``I am a permanent fighter for democracy,'' declared Dorligjav,
the party's deputy chairman. ``We will fight not only for the
election but beyond for political change.''
   The crowd waved the party's blue banners and joined in singing
Honkh's biggest hit, a song that urges Mongolians to wake up _
``The Sound of the Bell.''
   In one shantytown district in western Ulan Bator, an elderly
Buddhist monk who is running for the Great Hural led residents in
dedicating a hilltop shrine Saturday afternoon. They erected a
stone carved with the picture of a goddess and placed gifts of
yogurt and candy before it.
   Local residents said the hill had been an informal place of
prayer before the Communists virtually banned worship in the 1930s.
Religious freedom was one of the demands of the pro-democracy
demonstrators, and believers have begun reopening temples on their
own in the past few months.
   As the group dispersed, a campaign worker called out, ``Vote for
the National Progressives,'' the party to which the monk, Dagva,
belongs.
   The National Progressives also have a candidate in one of the
election's most dramatic races. One of their founding members, a
29-year-old lawyer named Ganbold, is facing the chairman of the
Communist Party, Gombojavyn Ochirbat, in a race for the Great Hural.
   Ochirbat, 61, took office in March after the demonstrations
forced his predecessor, Jambyn Batmonh, to resign. He has embraced
reform, but also stresses moderation and maintaining order. The
National Progressives favor rapid privatization and establishment
of laws to guarantee freedoms.
   Ganbold's campaign workers handed out the candidate's platform
and pictures of Genghis Khan, the 13th-century warrior who built a
great Mongol empire.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-mile-long column of 16,000 peasants
marched to the governing party headquarters Saturday to back their
demands for land reform.
   ``This is the only way we can open the doors of the agricultural
sector agencies, and the only way they'll take us into account and
provide solutions to our problems,'' protest leader Cesar del Angel
was quoted as saying by the independent Excelsior news service.
   The marchers arrived at the office complex of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party in downtown Mexico City after a
six-day trek from the state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico.
   They are demanding 200,000 acres of land in the state.
   They said the government promised the lnd in an Oct. 16 written
agreement with their organization, the National Movement of 400
Communities, the official news agency Notimex reported. The
movement is affiliated with the governing party.
   The agreement between the government and the peasants reportedly
calls for the breaking up of more than 210 large landholdings in
Veracruz, which would then be parceled out to farm families.
   Protesters also demanded a settlement of about $11 million for
lands lost in the development of a lake in the state of Mexico,
Notimex said.
   It has been government policy since the 1910-1920 revolution to
eliminate big, wealthy landholdings and distribute estates among
landless peasants.
   The policy has resulted in tiny, mostly inefficient farms worked
by individual families or owned collectively by villages.
   The previous two administrations claimed there were no more big
landholdings in Mexico and further land redistribution would hurt
productivity.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $14.5 Million to 14 Exposed to Asbestos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $14.5 million to 14 industrial
workers who sued a Florida manufacturer over their exposure to
asbestos.
   Most of the workers were employed at shipyards in Alabama, where
they worked with pipe insulation and cement containing asbestos,
said Russell Budd, a Dallas attorney representing the plaintiffs.
   The jury found that Celotex Corp. of Tampa, Fla., was liable for
health problems suffered by workers who installed or worked around
the asbestos products.
   In their decision Wednesday, the jurors found that the workers
suffered asbestos-related injuries, that Celotex failed to give
warnings of known asbestos dangers and that the asbestos products
were unreasonably dangerous.
   ``It showed these people (the workers) had a progressive lung
injury that scars the interior of the lungs and ultimately requires
oxygen therapy,'' Budd said.
   A man who answered the phone at Celotex's Houston plant Saturday
said no one would be available for comment until Monday and that
there was no weekend spokesman on duty.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1988. The case was tried in Dallas
because some of the original 27 defendants were based here. All the
defendants except Celotex settled for an undisclosed amount before
the case came to trial, Budd said.
   None of Budd's clients has died or been found to have cancer.
   The damages include about $4 million for future suffering. That
amount is to be split into awards of $75,000 to $750,000 per
plaintiff. Each plaintiff also was awarded $750,000 in punitive
damages.
   State District Judge Michael O'Neill must approve the award.

   A USAir flight made an emergency landing
Saturday after a passenger found a message written in soap on a
restroom mirror indicating a bomb was on board, an airline
spokesman said.
   Flight 1582 from Charlotte, N.C., to Chicago was delayed at the
Indianapolis International Airport for about three hours as FBI and
local law enforcement officers examined the plane, said USAir
spokesman John Bronson in Pittsburgh. No bomb was found.
   The 74 passengers and five crew members aboard the Boeing 737
got off the plane, and were interviewed by the FBI, Bronson said.
Three passengers were detained, said Bronson, who had no further
details. The FBI declined to comment on the incident.
   ``In the message, the word `bomb' was in it,'' he said. ``I
don't have the exact wording. The passenger alerted the crew and
the pilot diverted the aiplane because we take these things very
seriously.''
   The airplane landed at the airport at 9:55 a.m. The plane
stopped on the tarmac rather than taxi up to the terminal, but
passengers and crew did not use emergency exit to get off the
plane, Bronson said.

<HEAD>China Criticizes Britain's Plan for Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Saturday criticized Britain's decision
to grant citizenship to 50,000 Hong Kong families, saying it
violates the spirit of the agreement to return the colony to
Chinese rule in 1997.
   However, the Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the official
Xinhua News Agency, was less harsh than in the past.
   The measure passed in the British parliament Monday. It was
first proposed in December. Since then, the Chinese government has
attacked it repeatedly and angrily.
   The plan's aim is to prevent an immediate exodus of the colony's
most talented people by assuring them citizenship at Britain. They
could thus be guaranteed a new life in Britain at a later date.
   Saturday's statement said the measure was ``unacceptable to the
Chinese government'' and ``will not be recognized by the Chinese
side.''
   China threatened to ``take further measures at an appropriate
time in response to the erroneous action of the British side.'' It
did not elaborate.
   ``This move of the British side contravenes the spirit and
essence of the relevant agreement between China and Britain ... and
impairs China's sovereignty,'' the statement said.
   Britain and China in 1984 signed the agreement to return Hong
Kong to China in 1997, when the British lease on the colony runs
out. Hong Kong is an enclave on the southeastern coast of China.
   China has promised that Hong Kong can retain its free-wheeling
capitalist economy and lifestyle for 50 years after 1997, but
confidence in China's promises plummeted after last year's army
crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Beijing.
   The milder tone of Saturday's statement by China is probably
part of China's attempts to mend ties with Western nations,
including Britain, which banned high-level diplomatic contacts and
imposed economic sanctions after last year's crackdown.

   Seven teen-agers attacked a subway rider early
Saturday, slashing his neck, after terrorizing other train
passengers, Transit Authority police said.
   The 19-year-old victim, who staggered bleeding from the train
when it reached the Brighton Beach stop in Brooklyn, was in
critical condition at Coney Island Hospital following the 5:35 a.m.
attack.
   Four girls and three boys, ranging in age from 13 to 19, were
involved in the attack, said Transit Authority police spokesman Al
O'Leary.
   ``They were acting disorderly, very loud, and intimidating
passengers by waving belts,'' said O'Leary.
   ``There is no evidence of a robbery,'' O'Leary said when asked
what prompted the attack. ``Their motivation is unknown.''
   No weapon was recovered, he said.
   All seven teens were apprehended and charged with attempted
murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon, O'Leary said.

   Renowned naturalist Roger Tory
Peterson came close to drowning when his boat capsized off Maine,
and suffered chest pains while stranded on an island for four
hours, authorities said.
   The 82-year-old author of ``A Field Guide to the Birds,'' a
guidebook for birdwatchers published 52 years ago but still
considered the Bible of birding, spent two days in a hospital and
was released Saturday.
   The Lyme, Conn., man was rescued with five companions from
Western Egg Rock, also known as Puffin Island, after the group's
17-foot boat capsized in the surf Thursday night off the 1-acre
island in Muscongus Bay, the Coast Guard said.
   Peterson had been working on a documentary about bird life on
the uninhabited islands off Maine that he last visited a
half-century ago.
   Peterson and his companions were flown by helicopter to St.
Andrew's Hospital in Boothbay Harbor after they were picked up from
the island, said Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer William
Bless.
   Hospital tests showed Peterson did not suffer a heart attack.
   Peterson's famous guidebook revolutionized nature study, taking
ornithology out of the laboratory and making the feathered world of
the treetops more accessible.
   The book is found in more than 3 million homes and libraries and
is considered one of the main reasons 60 million Americans take an
interest in birds.

   A single-engine, banner-towing plane
on its way to the beaches crashed and burned shortly after taking
off Saturday, killing the pilot, officials said.
   Jack Beale took off around 11 a.m. from the landing strip at Sky
Signs' banner-plane airfield near Conway, just northwest of this
resort, when the plane's engine apparently stalled and the plane
crashed, officials said.
   The 63-year-old Conway man had just picked up a new advertising
banner, which he was going to tow over the beachfront. He had no
passengers.
   The plane exploded on impact, and the flames had virtually
burned out when firefighters arrived, said Charlie Brown of the
Horry County Volunteer Fire Department.
   Beale had been flying for Sky Signs for about three months, said
company co-owner Mike Marion.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials from Atlanta were on
their way to the crash site to investigate the accident.

<TEXT>
   The nation's top military official
praised blacks' contributions in U.S. wars at a ceremony Saturday
opening construction of a monument to the ``buffalo soldiers'' who
fought in the West.
   The Buffalo Soldier Monument will honor all black American
soldiers, said Gen. Colin Powell, the first black chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``From pre-Revolutionary times through the Revolutionary War,
through every one of our wars and on up to the present, black men
and women have willingly served and died,'' Powell said.
   ``But for most of that time blacks served without recognition or
reward for the contribution they made for our freedom,'' he said,
adding that it was ``freedom they did not enjoy here in their own
beloved native land.''
   The monument is planned for the Fort Leavenworth grounds near
Smith Lake in northeast Kansas, where the buffalo soldiers of the
10th Regiment once camped between campaigns against Indians on the
Great Plains.
   ``America has made enormous progress from the days of the
buffalo soldiers to the days of a black chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff,'' Powell said. ``We aren't perfect. We never will
be. But the beauty of this country is that we're always making
progress.''
   Powell serves as the top military adviser to the president, the
secretary of defense and the National Security Council.
   The 9th and 10th Calvary Regiments of buffalo soldiers were
formed by Congress in 1866 to patrol the western frontier. It was
the Indians who dubbed black men who served in the segregated
regiments the ``buffalo soldiers.''
   In their service from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, the
buffalo soldiers endured discrimination, hardships and neglect that
white regiments didn't have to suffer. They protected settlers,
built forts and fought Apaches and Comanches on the Great Plains
and along the Texas border.
   The monument's design calls for a large bronze statue of a
rifle-carrying buffalo soldier on a horse. In the design, the
soldier stands on rocks between two ponds _ one behind him to
represent the past and a reflective pool in front to see into the
future.
   Water will flow over the rocks into the reflective pool.

<HEAD>Oka Mayor Proposes Selling Disputed Land to End Mohawk Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of this Quebec town said Saturday
that a deal had been struck to sell the federal government a
disputed parcel of land in the hope of ending an 18-day-old armed
standoff between police and Mohawks.
   Meanwhile, Indian negotiators met to draw up their response to
the latest proposals from Quebec authorities to end the
confrontation.
   The standoff in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, began after
police rushed a barricade set up by the Mohawks to stop the
expansion of the local golf course on land they claim is ancestral.
An officer was killed in the gun battle that followed, but it is
still not clear if he was shot by Indians or fellow officers.
   The Assembly of First Nations, an Indian organization, said at
least 5,000 people were expected to take part in a mass rally
Sunday in Oka. Organizers are billing it as the largest Indian
demonstration in Canadian history.
   Demonstrators have been asked to bring flowers to present to the
police as a symbol of peace.
   Oka Mayor Jean Ouellette said a deal had been reached Friday to
sell the federal government a 67-acre parcel of land that had been
slated for the golf course expansion, town spokesman Robert McCoy
said. The proposed purchase price was not disclosed.
   The land would be combined with a 30-acre tract that Ottawa's
Indian Affairs Department plans to buy from a French businessman to
make a reserve for the Kahnesatake Mohawk community in Oka.
   Ouellette told more than 100 local residents gathered outside
the town hall that he would recommend that the town council approve
the land sale as a special meeting on Tuesday, McCoy said.
   But many in the crowd expressed opposition to the deal, accusing
federal and provincial authorities of giving in to the Mohawks at
their expense.
   Under the proposed deal, the federal government would provide
compensation to homeowners on or near the land to be sold for use
as a Mohawk reserve and help make up for future lost municipal
taxes from the acreage, McCoy said.
   There was no immediate reaction from Mohawk representatives to
the land purchase proposals.
   On Friday, Mohawk negotiator Mavis Etienne shrugged off the
government's planned purchase of the 30 acres, saying: ``No one has
any business negotiating for our land, acting like they are buying
it when they don't even own it.''
   Mohawk negotiators met Saturday behind their barricades in Oka,
but had no immediate response to a set of proposals from Quebec
Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia to settle the dispute.
   On Friday, Ciaccia said Quebec is prepared to withdraw nearly
all the police from Oka and the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve south of
Montreal. The Kahnawake Indians have blocked the Mercier Bridge to
Montreal in sympathy with the Oka Mohawks, forcing commuters to
make long detours.
   In return, Ciaccia proposed that the Mohawks withdraw from their
barricades and turn in their weapons and explosives.
   However, the provincial official rejected a demand for amnesty
for those involved in the gun battle with provincial police.
Instead, Ciaccia proposed setting up a commission of inquiry _ with
a Mohawk representative _ to investigate the death of the policeman.

<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor says the food she's
eaten since she's been in jail hardly has been haute cuisine and
the former Miss Hungary could use one of her fur coats, her husband
said Saturday.
   ``She complained she was freezing very much last night, so I
packed her a couple of pillows and some silk covers and took it in
to jail so she's not going to freeze tonight,'' Frederick von
Anhalt said.
   Miss Gabor spent her first night in jail Friday, after beginning
a three-day sentence for slapping a Beverly Hills policeman during
a traffic stop last year.
   Police Sgt. Byron Sumrow said the tempestuous Miss Gabor hasn't
been asking for anything special.
   ``The worst you could get out of her was that the food wasn't
that great,'' Sumrow said.
   ``She ate the same breakfast as our other prisoners,'' Sumrow
said. ``It's standard county issue _ a TV-type frozen breakfast
which serves hash browns, toast and scrambled eggs.''
   Von Anhalt described the food as ``hamburger and mashed
potatoes,'' and said his wife won't be eating much during her stay.
   ``It's not her favorite food. She likes salads, she likes lots
of salads and diet food and the food is very rich,'' he said. ``She
is on a diet anyhow, so she's not going to eat very much.''
   Von Anhalt visited his wife Saturday morning, along with
daughter Francesca, Sumrow said.
   For lunch Miss Gabor had a cold sandwich and coffee. On the
dinner menu was salisbury steak, peas and potatoes, a roll with
butter, and coffee or water.
   ``It's nourishing and county-approved,'' Sumrow said.
   Miss Gabor spent Friday night in an 8-foot by 10-foot private
cell with a metal-frame bed, a toilet and sink. She is scheduled to
be released Monday afternoon.
   Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin enforced a three-day jail
sentence last May after ruling Miss Gabor had violated probation by
failing to perform 120 hours of community service at a shelter for
homeless women.
   Along with her jail time and community service, Rubin ordered
Miss Gabor to pay nearly $13,000 in fines and restitution.

   A Kansas City philanthropist returned
Saturday to the town where he robbed a bank more than 30 years ago,
this time to donate $50,000 for a new band shell in the city park.
   Delbert Dunmire robbed the Commercial State Bank of Abilene of
about $2,600 in October 1958.
   Dunmire said his donation for the band shell in Eisenhower Park
represented compounded interest for the money he stole.
   ``It was an act of malfeasance on my part, and I can't make
excuses for it,'' he said. ``It was a crime against society that I
can never repay society for. And I'm not attempting to do that now.
   ``I am attempting to go back and cover my tail wherever I have
done wrong and try to do right,'' he said.
   Dunmire was caught after the robbery, and served time in prison.
   His wife, Debbie, presented the check Saturday to Marlin
Fitzwater, an Abilene native and President Bush's press secretary,
who was in town for his 30th high school class reunion. Fitzwater
than gave the check to city officials.
   During the ceremony, Dunmire joked about the long-ago bank
robbery. After being presented a key to the city from Mayor Wade
Phillips, Dunmire joked it was the key to a jail cell.
   After the ceremony, Dunmire produced a maroon gym bag loaded
with cash and let people reach in to each take one unseen bill.
People of all ages reached into the bag, which was filled with $1,
$5, $10, $20 and $100 bills.
   The new band shell will replace a band shell destroyed by fire
in February 1989. Work on the new shell was expected to be finished
by late summer.
   Dunmire is the founder of Growth Industries Inc. in Kansas City.
The millionaire businessman also has donated weapons to the
Missouri State Highway Patrol.

   Hong Kong authorities Saturday intercepted 31
Vietnamese boat people in a wooden fishing boat off this British
colony.
   The refugees _ 15 men, 14 women and two boys _ were expected to
be sent to detention centers after screening, police said.
   No further details were available as to where the group left
from in Vietnam.
   A total of 3,697 Vietnamese boat people have arrived in Hong
Kong so far this year. About 55,000 of the refugees are in Hong
Kong camps awaiting resettlement overseas or repatriation to
Vietnam.
   Under a policy adopted in 1988 to reduce the number of new
arrivals, those who fled their homeland for economic reasons do not
qualify for refugee status and resettlement. The vast majority of
detainees affected by the new law are expected to face mandatory
repatriation to Vietnam.

   The Honolulu Symphony Orchestra won't miss a
beat this season, symphony officials said after reaching an
agreement Saturday on a new contract.
   Symphony Society Board Chairman William Quinn said the
settlement means Saturday night's Starlight ``Pops'' Concert
featuring guest conductor and pianist Peter Nero would go on as
scheduled.
   The settlement was announced at 9:30 a.m., 12 hours after the
musicians took up picket signs for their second strike in four
years. Their previous strike in 1986 lasted three months.
   The performers overwhelmingly approved the new pact in the
afternoon, their union said, but details of the vote and the
contract were not released.
   Wages were a key issue in the dispute over a new contract to
replace one that expired May 31.
   Although the strike began Friday night, negotiations continued
until 6:30 a.m. Saturday when they broke off. It was unclear just
how the agreement came about.
   The settlement covers some 60 full-time musicians and 20
part-timers.
   Musicians Association of Hawaii Local 677 President Milton
Carter said base pay for the musicians in Honolulu is $21,400,
compared to $55,000 in San Francisco and $35,000 to $45,000 in
Rochester, N.Y.
   During negotiations in May the union proposed an increase to put
the base salary at $34,775.

   Three gunmen posing as flower-bearing
mourners at a New York City gang member's funeral opened fire on
about 100 people at a cemetery Saturday, wounding seven people,
officials said.
   At least seven other people were trampled in the panic that
followed the gunfire around 2:30 p.m. at Rosedale Memorial Park in
this city just south of Newark, and were treated at hospitals for
cuts and bruises.
   A 20-year-old man who was among those shot was flown by
helicopter to the trauma unit of University Hospital in Newark. The
others' wounds were not considered life-threatening, hospital
officials said.
   Police Capt. Raymond Beckman said the funeral was for a
Vietnamese man who was member of a New York gang called Born to
Kill.
   About 100 people were attending the funeral when the gunmen
fired, then fled, Beckman said.
   ``As they walked by the casket with a bouquet of flowers, they
dropped them and opened fire on the mourners,'' the captain said.
   New York police said the funeral to bury Vinh Vuu, 21, began in
Chinatown in lower Manhattan earlier Saturday. Vuu was shot four
times in the chest early Wednesday in a drive-by shooting in
Chinatown, said police Sgt. Tina Mohrmann.
   She said Vuu was a leader of the Chinatown-based Vietnamese gang.
   Beckman said three weapons were used, including an Uzi
submachine gun and a shotgun. A 9mm Beretta handgun was found on
the ground. That gun, which had been fired, may have been used by
someone in the crowd, firing back at the shooters, Beckman said at
a news conference.
   Police were searching for three suspects Saturday night, said
police Lt. Richard Gerbounka
   Beckman agreed with New York police that the shooting may be
related to gangland strife between the Vietnamese gang and Chinese
gangs in lower Manhattan.
   The gunmen were apparently wearing sunglasses and trench coats,
making it difficult for witnesses to say whether they were Chinese,
Vietnamese or Caucasian, Beckman said.
   The people attending the funeral were brought to the police
station for questioning. Beckman said accounts differed on how the
gunmen got away.
   Police earlier said investigation efforts were hindered because
most of the mourners, who were Vietnamese, spoke little or no
English, but Beckman later said they spoke English and were
cooperating.
   The man flown to University Hospital was taken to the operating
room, said nursing supervisor Dorothy Crews.
   Beckman said five people were shot, but hospital officials said
seven people were admitted for gunshot wounds.
   One woman and five men aged 17 to 21 were taken to Elizabeth
General Hospital, where they were in stable condition with gunshot
wounds, said nursing supervisor Bobbie Fairchild. A 22-year-old man
was treated for a twisted ankle.
   Six people were taken to Rahway Hospital for injuries suffered
when they were trampled and for shock, said hospital spokeswoman
Nancy Jackson.
   Published reports last year said the Born to Kill gang has used
terror tactics to break into Chinatown's underworld power structure.
   Authorities said then that the gang was responsible for
robberies, assaults and murders and heroin trafficking.

   Bertha, the first hurricane of the Atlantic season,
was born Saturday, but turned away from the Florida coast and
headed out to sea, forecasters said.
   Bertha became a tropical storm Saturday afternoon, but
strengthened and was declared a hurricane hours later when its top
sustained winds hit 75 mph.
   ``Hurricane Bertha really isn't much of a concern to the U.S.
mainland,'' said meteorologist Jesse Moore of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``The only piece of land it could possibly affect at all would
be Bermuda, and we don't have it forecast to go up that way yet,''
he added. ``It's highly unlikely they'll see much more than some
swells.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Bertha's center was at 30.5 degrees north
latitude and 72.8 degrees west longitude, or 520 miles east of
Jacksonville. The hurricane was moving northeast at about 10 mph,
and was expected to maintain that course through Sunday,
forecasters said.
   Bertha is threatened by a low-pressure zone off the Carolina and
Virginia coasts generating strong, upper-level winds that could cut
the top off the hurricane and weaken it considerably, Moore said.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Arthur, which peaked with 70 mph wind
Thursday but quickly lost strength Friday, had ``completely
dissipated. You can't even see any remnants of him in the satellite
pictures,'' Case said.
   Tropical storms are named when their sustained wind speed
reaches 39 mph and become hurricanes when wind speed builds to 74
mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>New Jersey Woman Wins Appeal in Syria Export Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court said Friday a New
Jersey woman should have been allowed to withdraw her guilty plea
in an arms export case because her lawyer had not effectively
represented her.
   The three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia sent the case back to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfiled Jackson for further proceedings.
   Jackson had sentenced the woman, Rosemary Loughery of Mount
Holly, N.J. to two years in prison in 1987 but had allowed her to
remain free pending appeal.
   She had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to ship an air
navigation beacon system with her business partner in violation of
arms export license requirements. Her partner, Kevin Paul Gilday of
Philadelphia, had been sentenced by the judge to 20 months to five
years on the same conspiracy count.
   Ms. Loughery originally had been charged with the conspiracy
count and nine counts of mail fraud alleging that the defendants
tried to `defraud the United States of the right to conduct its
lawful business affairs and implement the foreign policy of the
United States of America free from stealth, chicanery, false
statements, fraud and deceit.''
   On the advice of her lawyer, Francis Hartman, she agreed to
plead guilty to the conspiracy count in exchange for dropping the
mail fraud counts, thus reducing her maximum exposure to prison
from 50 years to five, the appelate judges noted.
   The judges also noted that though she told probation officers
she believed she had done nothing wrong.
   Between her indictment and her plea, the Supreme Court ruled
that mail fraud charges could not be used to protect ``intangible
rights,'' but only in cases alleging the loss of money or property.
   Hartman did not tell his client of that development. She found
out about it through newspapers and told him she wanted to withdraw
her plea of guilty. But Hartman advised her to wait until Gilday
was sentenced before making up her mind, which she did.
   Jackson refused to let her withdraw the plea, saying it was
``motivated by an apprehension that she will receive a like
sentence.'' She then fired Hartman and got a new lawyer.
   If she had withdrawn her plea when she wanted to, three months
earlier, Jackson probably would have let her, the appellate panel
said.
   ``Her constitutional right to a jury trial was at stake, not
Hartman's,'' the judges wrote Friday.
   ``This is not a case where counsel has made a strategic decision
that in retrospect, with the benefit of hindsight, appears to have
been ill-advised. Rather, Hartman's conduct evinces an abdication
of his repsonsibility to his client.''
   No beacons were delivered. Gilday had been dealing with
undercover customs agents.

<HEAD>Hunt Continues for Flight 811 Cargo Door</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A remote-controlled submarine searching the
ocean floor for the cargo door that blew off a United Airlines jet
last year has yet to find anything after four days underwater, a
Navy spokesman said Friday.
   The Orion deep submergence system, equipped with sonar and a
video camera, is prowling the ocean bottom nearly three miles deep
and about 100 miles south of Honolulu.
   The search will cover 24 square miles of the ocean floor twice
and is expected to continue until the middle of next week, Lt.
Cmdr. Bob Anderson said.
   In the Feb. 24, 1989 accident, the cargo door on United Airlines
Flight 811 opened at 22,000 feet, tearing away a section of the
Boeing 747 fuselage. Of the 355 passengers aboard the flight from
Honolulu International Airport to New Zealand, nine were swept to
their deaths and five were seriously injured.
   The crew managed to return the jet safely to Honolulu.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has completed its
inquiry into the accident, but requested the search for the 10
foot-by-10 foot door with hopes its inspection will lead to better
plane safety.
   Personnel aboard the 226-foot Navy ocean tug Narragansett have
placed in the ocean a field of electronic transponders, which
transmit electrical signals to chart movements of the video
camera-equipped Orion sub.
   The transponders hang about 150 feet above the ocean floor
around the perimeter of the search area.
   If the door is spotted by the submersible, a second device will
be deployed at a later date to recover it.
   The door is believed to be lying under about 15,000 feet of
water.
   The NTSB's inquiry determined that a faulty design of the door's
locking mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely
indicate the door was locked.
   It blamed United, Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failure to correct problems with the door.

<HEAD>NAACP Sues Insurer Alleging Racially Discriminatory Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP and several black homeowners filed a
discrimination lawsuit Friday alleging that the city's largest
provider of homeowner's insurance instructed agents to stop writing
policies for blacks.
   The class-action lawsuit drafted by the American Civil Liberties
Union was filed in U.S. District Court against American Family
Mutual Insurance Co., based in Madison.
   ``We see this as a national issue, as part of a national trend,
and in this country, we still believe that separate but unequal is
against the law,'' said John Powell, national legal director for
the ACLU.
   The action seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order
to stop the practice.
   American Family spokesman Gary Gibson declined to comment on the
lawsuit, saying he hadn't seen the document. But he denied any
charges of the practice known as redlining, in which insurers
instruct agents to avoid selling policies in areas with more than
25 percent black residents.
   ``We have made a concerted effort to serve the inner city and
minorities,'' Gibson said in a brief telephone interview.
   The plaintiffs include Alderman Marvin Pratt, who alleges the
insurer reduced his homeowner's coverage when he moved into an
inner-city neighborhood.
   ``I'm just representative of the many numbers of folks who live
in certain zip codes who have been discriminated against,'' Pratt
said.
   Evidence in the lawsuit includes a handwritten note from an
American Family manager to an agent that reads: ``Quit writing all
those blacks!! They are the reason for your poor persistency.''
   The note was turned over to the plaintiffs by an agent who has
given a sworn statement about the company's practices, said the
ACLU and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   The lawsuit alleged the insurer discriminates against black
homeowners by instructing agents not to sell policies to blacks,
failing to hire and retain black agents and locate offices in black
neighborhoods and offering blacks ``less advantageous'' terms than
whites.
   The lawsuit also alleged redlining. Wisconsin NAACP President
Felmers Chaney said redlining makes it difficult for black
homeowners to maintain the value of their property, leads to the
decline of inner-city neighborhoods and promotes segregation.
   ACLU spokesman William Lynch said the problem of redlining is
industrywide, but American Family has been sued because it has the
worst record of discriminating against blacks.

   A high-ranking Army officer plunged to

fatality at Fort Bragg this year, authorities said Friday.
   Col. Richard J. Malvesti died from injuries received in a
parachute jump at the Holland Drop Zone on Fort Bragg about 10 p.m.

   Malvesti was a native of Quincy, Mass. He was commissioned in
the Army in 1967 and had been assigned to Fort Bragg since 1980.
   Military authorities declined to release more details about the
accident pending an investigation.
   The last parachute fatality at Fort Bragg was in January, also
during a training exercise, officials said.

<HEAD>State, Archdiocese Agree on AIDS Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Friday gave the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York approval to care for AIDS patients in
nursing homes, exempting it from requirements that patients receive
contraceptives, safe-sex counseling and abortion services.
   The state Public Health Council's action came despite protests
by some AIDS activists.
   Approval had been delayed while the archdiocese found ways to
provide AIDS education without violating its teachings against
condom use, extramarital sex, homosexuality and other practices.
   The state requires that patients be told how to avoid the
transmission of the AIDS virus by using condoms and to inform
patients of the dangers of intravenous drug use.
   Under the compromise announced Friday, the archdiocese will
provide education and information to nursing home residents about
sexual practices that transmit AIDS and the benefits of condoms,
said Health Department spokeswoman Frances Tarleton.
   Catholic nursing homes will routinely refer patients to
off-premise agencies ``for more intensive counseling or if they
wanted to get condoms, abortion, or other gynecological services,
like birth control,'' said Tarleton.
   The compromise will result in 266 new AIDS beds at three
archdiocese-run nursing homes. There is no target date for adding
the beds, said archdiocesan spokesman Joseph Zwilling.
   Tarleton said that by the end of 1995, the city will need an
estimated 3,000 nursing home beds to care for AIDS patients. There
are now only 44, all at the Terence Cardinal Cooke nursing home run
by the archdiocese.
   The state has received applications for only 1,700 more beds
despite incentives like state-backed loans, enhanced Medicaid
reimbursements rates and planning grants.
   Members of ACT-UP, an AIDS activist group, demonstrated at
Friday's meeting. They oppose the church's involvement in AIDS care
because of its stance on condoms, abortion and other issues.
   ``The fact of the matter is, they (archdiocese officials) have
come forward where other organizations ... have not,'' said
Tarleton. ``The state's position is that we need desperately to get
these nursing home beds in place in New York City.''
   She said the nursing homes will provide an alternative for AIDS
patients languishing in hospital beds and for people who can't get
home health care.
   ``It's not the most ideal way to handle AIDS prevention
education but we think it does reflect an effort on the part of the
archdiocese to ... provide these services to residents,'' said
Tarleton.

   Oil analysts predict crude prices and the cost of
gasoline will rise later this year as a result of the OPEC
agreement to curb output.
   Price-depressing overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates is less likely after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
intimidation campaign aimed at making the countries honor their
OPEC-set output quotas, analysts said.
   Under the agreement reached Friday by the 13 ministers of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, gasoline prices are
expected to rise up to 10 cents a gallon by December.
   The OPEC members agreed on a new overall production cap of 22.5
million barrels a day through the rest of the year. The figure is
400,000 barrels above the previous ceiling but will require OPEC to
cut its actual production, currently estimated at 23 million
barrels a day or more.

   ``Where I stand now reflects the majority of the people of this

   The bill Roemer vetoed Friday would have prohibited abortions
except to save the life of the mother and in cases of aggravated
rape and incest reported to police and a physician no more than a
week after they occurred.
   On July 6, Roemer vetoed an even tougher bill lacking the
exceptions for rape and incest. Two-thirds majorities in both
legislative chambers are required to override a veto; an override
of the earlier veto passed the House but fell three votes short in

   A farm bill that keeps major support programs

agricultural law ever passed by the Senate, the Agriculture
Committee chairman says.
   The $54 billion measure, setting farm policy and spending for
the next five years, was approved Friday. The House version is
expected to pass next week, followed by a conference committee to
iron out any differences between the two versions.
   ``It's the most progressive farm bill I've seen come out of this
body,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who guided the bill to the
final 70-21 vote after taking a strong interest in seeing
environmental provisions strengthened.
   The bill establishes price-support programs for commodities and
sets policy for nutrition programs, agricultural exports, soil and
water conservation, agricultural research and extension work, food
inspection and other responsibilities of the Agriculture Department.

<HEAD>A Criticism of Downsizing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Downsizing has become perhaps the most commonly
used technique by which American businesses hope to contain costs
and become more competitive. Managers say it is quick and effective.
   Those who have practiced it point to smaller payrolls, reduced
expenses and lower overall administrative costs. Sometimes plants
and offices can be closed and sold off. In general, downsizing is
viewed as cutting the fat.
   That may be how it's viewed, but that's not the result, says a
professor who in three years talked to many chief executives and
managers and surveyed 3,000 management employees in 30 downsized
companies.
   The majority of downsizing efforts are failures, declares
Profsssor Kim S. Cameron of the University of Michigan. He found
that unless management was very good, ``the employees performed
worse after the cutbacks.''
   In fact, said Cameron, ``in only five or six of the
organizations I studied did I see a marked increase in
productivity. In all the rest, performance went down.''
   Considering the context into which that statement was delivered,
it is indeed a shocking one. In the past decade, hardly a company
with any measure of pride hasn't considered downsizing. Thousands
did it.
   At times, downsizing became almost a fad.
   It was the all-purpose remedy for ailments only vaguely
discerned. Why, it was even patriotic: How could America compete in
the new global economy if it wasn't lean, mean, fit and determined
_ free of bureaucratic midriff?
   But management, says Cameron, has been reactive, viewing
downsizing as defensive, protective, conservative. It hasn't been
proactive. Rather than thinking through the issues, it focused on
the quick fix.
   ``There is no such thing as a quick fix when downsizing,'' says
Cameron. Such an approach is more destructive than constructive. It
is the ``grenade approach,'' or ``throwing something at the problem
and making a big noise.''
   Effective downsizing must be thought through. It must be part of
a broad strategy because ``effective downsizing is a transformation
of a firm's culture as much as it is a reduction in personnel.''
   Effectively implemented, downsizing begins with an analysis of
tasks, resources and talents, and an understanding of what jobs and
people can be eliminated and which ones the company cannot afford
to lose.
   It must involve strong, visible, visionary leaders who can
describe a process and outcome that employees will support. It
should involve ``bottom-up'' participation of employees.
   The strategy should employ teamwork, especially among salaried
workers, and those teams should communicate with each other. It
should even involve suppliers, distributors and customers.
   Rather than one huge and potentially destructive shock, it is
wiser to use small, slow steps over a period of time. All the
while, the downsizers should keep their eye on quality and the
maintenance of it.
   If you want to fail, Cameron observes, you might try
across-the-board layoffs and attrition without benefit of analysis;
load work on remaining employees; seek more work for the same pay;
and think of quality only in terms of error-detection.
   Do that, he suggests, and the downsizing effort, almost always
begun in an attempt to make the company more efficient, will make
it worse off than before.

<HEAD>Darwinism in Retailing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The increasing likelihood of leaner times for
the rest of the year will pile more problems on retailers
struggling to stand out in a crowded pack and maintain market
share, analysts say.
   Laggard performers, like Sears, Roebuck and Co., will have tough
jobs boosting profitability if consumer spending continues to slow.
   By contrast, powerhouses that have managed to motor along
strongly despite a difficult economic environment are poised to go
forward without a blip in their balance sheets. In other words, the
Wal-Marts of this world will prevail.
   In an application of Darwin's theory of evolution, the
efficiently run retailers will survive and prosper while the weak
ones could be headed for extinction, says Edward A. Weller of
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   No one wants to put Sears on the endangered species list. It is
clear, however, that the nation's largest retailer has more than a
few things in common with the proverbial dinosaur.
   This past week Sears posted a 39 percent drop in second-quarter
earnings. Although high insurance payouts by its Allstate Insurance
Group took a heavy toll on the company, analysts were more
concerned by the retailing results.
   The drag on earnings caused by Allstate was considered a
one-time event. The problems within the Sears Merchandise Group,
which reported a 32 percent decline in operating income, indicates
something might be rotten at the core of the company.
   Long gone are the days when the retail giant was an industry
standard bearer. An effort begun last year to regain its glory by
revamping merchandise strategy still hasn't borne fruit.
   Sears' double-pronged program involving the introduction of more
national brands, from General Electric appliances to Pirelli tires,
and a switch to an everyday low pricing policy appears to be
sparking little buying enthusiasm among customers.
   Analysts say the moves may have been made too late. Or, maybe it
just takes an extra long time to change the course of such a
mammoth operation. Indeed, it will take a lot to influence the
bottom line of a company that annually reels in more than $30
billion in revenue.
   ``Sears, K mart are working like hell to get efficient but there
isn't much evidence that they're accomplishing it yet,'' said
Weller. ``I think it's going to be tough for them.''
   Sears, and to a lesser extent its nearest rival K mart Corp.,
are playing catchup _ even though they outrank all their
competitors in terms of nationwide sales volume.
   This leaves room for nimbler competitors, such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., to maneuver in building up marketplace clout.
Wal-Mart, which is pursuing an aggressive expansion campaign, is
widely expected to eventually unseat Sears and K mart from their
top two positions on the national retail roster.
   How soon _ or whether _ the Nos. 1 and 2 retailers get knocked
from the top of the heap may depend on how they fare in the near
future.
   An unprecedented run of robust consumer spending in the '80s has
waned, replaced by an era of frugality, economists say and consumer
surveys confirm. People are putting away more money in anticipation
of lean times, which reduces disposable income.
   Mindful of the forecasts, store operators have kept close tabs
on inventories to minimize costs and protect profitability.
   Orders have been flowing into stores for the important
back-to-school season and analysts expect to get a reading on how
well merchandise is moving out the door by late August or early
September.
   Sluggish back-to-school business could be a harbinger of a
ho-hum Christmas season, a time on which retailers rely for the
bulk of their annual revenue and income.
   ``It's sort of a gloomy outlook for spending,'' says Karen Sack
of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York. ``It looks pretty rough for
retailers.''

<HEAD>Metropolitan Cathedral Sinking Like a `Dried Souffle'</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA CASTANEDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A torrential rain came right through the roof
of the Metropolitan Cathedral during a news conference last year on
preserving it and Mexico's other historical treasures.
   ``We had to leave the table because we were getting wet,'' said
Efrain Castro Morales, cultural secretary of Puebla state. ``It was
a big scandal.''
   A subsequent study found the leaky roof to be a minor problem
compared with others that might cause North America's oldest and
most important cathedral to collapse in 30 years unless major
repairs were made.
   Sergio Zaldivar Guerra, an architect who conducted the study for
the secretary of urban and ecological development, said
Metropolitan Cathedral has been sinking since construction began in
1573.
   The cathedral houses an impressive collection of religious
paintings, sculptures and altarpieces. It has four identical domes,
five altars and 14 chapels with Baroque and neo-classical touches,
but structurally, everything is askew.
   Outside, the buckling earth has broken the concrete of the
plaza, forming waves around the cathedral. Windows and doorframes
tilt to left or right. Repaired cracks scar the walls. Metal
patches and clamps mark and measure newer fissures that zig-zag
around the building.
   Inside, thick crevices _ one about 66 feet long _ run along the
marble floors and up the columns. Scaffolding blocks off areas
where workers are repairing damaged domes. The ceiling is dotted
with water stains.
   Most of Mexico City also is sinking because it is built on the
swampy beds of Lake Texcoco, over the ruins of Tenochtitlan, the
Aztec capital.
   The spongy subsoil's instability has damaged several important
buildings, including the adjacent National Palace, the Palace of
the Fine Arts and the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
   Zaldivar said the problems in the other structures were not as
severe because the buildings were smaller and lighter than the
cathedral, which weighs an estimated 130,000 tons.
   He said the worst part is that the cathedral is sinking
unevenly, ``like a dried souffle.''
   The Metropolitan Cathedral took 250 years to complete and sits
on the largest plaza in the Western hemisphere, second in the world
only to Red Square in Moscow.
   During his 14-month investigation, Zaldivar found fractures in
domes and column bases, and other damage to arches and walls.
   Acid rain has eroded the outer surface. The area between the
main altar and western tower has sunk about 8 feet and continues to
drop at a rate of .05 inches a month.
   Construction of a drainage system in the 1960s also weakened the
ground under the cathedral, as did excavation of the Aztec Templo
Mayor, or Great Temple, subway construction and digging wells for
drinking water.
   ``They did not know what would happen,'' Zaldivar said of those
decisions.
   Castro, the state official, said economic problems forced
previous administrations to neglect Mexico's important monuments,
``but it did not have to reach this grave situation.''
   Work was done, but Zaldivar said the scope of the problem was
not known at the time.
   He said the sinking cannot be stopped, but the cathedral can be
made to subside more evenly by digging pits under the higher parts
and removing mud and sediment to lower them. Underground steel
supports will be used to prop up sagging areas, Zaldivar said.
   ``Whatever is necessary'' will be spent and the government has
made an initial allocation of $3.9 million for the restoration,
Zaldivar said. The work, which began three months ago, will take at
least 6 years and the cathedral will remain open.
   Zaldivar said the work would have to be repeated periodically
over at least the next century, until earth stops compressing and
solidifies.
   ``It is safe for the next 30 years, but the sooner we complete
the work the better,'' he said.

<HEAD>Unprecedented Indictment of Eastern Not a Nail in Coffin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's already flown through more than a decade of
staggering losses, relentless competition, a difficult takeover,
management-labor feuding, an emotional strike, bankruptcy court and
blasts of bad press.
   So the last thing Eastern Airlines needed was a criminal
indictment for doctoring maintenance records, an unprecedented
event in the airline business.
   Nonetheless, industry analysts and travel agents don't view the
60-count indictment handed up this past week against Eastern and
nine managers as a fatal bullet for an airline that has
demonstrated its ability to survive.
   Some say Eastern could handily ride this one out, partly by
cutting its already-discounted fares further in order to woo
skeptical passengers.
   ``If Eastern is going to charge less, with no restrictions on
the tickets, people are still going to fly them no matter what,''
said Jack Bloch, owner of JB's Travel World, a New York travel
agency. ``Everyone who's on a budget thing will fly them.''
   William Cooper, head of Adventure Travels of Pompano Beach and
Boca Raton, Fla., said he believed many passengers already have a
thick skin about flying in general and quickly will forget the
Eastern indictment.
   ``I know passengers who will say, `If the pilot's willing to get
into the airplane and risk his life, why shouldn't I?,''' Cooper
said. ``I think Eastern has had enough of a public relations
problem anyway, so how much more damage can this do?''
   The indictment was the result of a 10-month probe by federal
prosecutors into the airline's maintenance practices at airports in
New York and Atlanta and Eastern's headquarters in Miami.
   It portrayed a pattern of violations that included installing
faulty cockpit instruments and ignoring water buildups in fuel
tanks, as well as tinkering with maintenance records to show all
work had been done properly.
   The indictment also depicted Eastern as coercing maintenance
crews to flout safety guidelines at all costs for sake of keeping
airplanes flying and passenger-ticket revenue flowing.
   None of the alleged infractions caused accidents or injuries and
all were said to have taken place between July 1985 and last
October. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn delivered the indictment
after plea bargain talks between the airline and U.S. attorney
Andrew Maloney collapsed.
   The indictment posed an acute challenge to Martin R. Shugrue
Jr., an airline veteran appointed to run Eastern three months ago
by a federal bankruptcy court. The court has been overseeing
Eastern's affairs since March 1989, when a crippling strike forced
the airline to seek protection from creditors.
   In appointing Shugrue, the court took control of Eastern from
Frank Lorenzo, the head of Eastern's parent Continental Holdings.
Lorenzo bought Eastern in 1986 and subsequently was accused by
Eastern's unions of nearly bleeding the carrier to death to cut
costs and make Eastern profitable.
   Shugrue had been in the midst of orchestrating an aggressive
campaign to put the Lorenzo legacy behind and convince the flying
public that Eastern and its workers are exuberant, efficient _ and
safe.
   He sought to minimize the indictment's impact by announcing it
before Maloney did. He also took out advertisements in leading
newspapers nationwide, asserting that the Federal Aviation
Administration had fined Eastern 16 months ago for the same
problems and everything had been corrected.
   ``Today if Eastern weren't meeting the highest government
standards of safety we would not be flying,'' Shugrue said.
   Industry experts familiar with Eastern's past problems agreed
with him.
   ``I think Eastern reacted intelligently with the ads. They drove
home the fact that this is stale bread,'' said Morten Beyer,
chairman of Avmark, an aviation consulting concern in Arlington, Va.
   ``No airplanes were delayed, no airplanes crashed, nobody was
hurt. It was a victimless crime,'' he said. ``So I don't think it's
going to have a protracted effect.''
   Still, the indictment could compound an already difficult
financial situation for Eastern. It came only a few months before
the airline industry's slowest part of the year begins. That means
an already strapped Eastern is facing the prospect of cutting fares
to woo business.
   ``A lot of people realize that for Eastern to survive, the
present structure can't continue,'' Cooper said. ``They've got some
fares that are so low now, in certain markets they're losing their
shirts. How much lower can they go, how much are other airlines
going to allow them to go?''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More evidence emerged that showed the economy has fallen to
near-recession levels. The government said gross national product
grew at an anemic 1.2 percent rate in the April-June quarter and it
revised estimates of earlier growth downward. Major automakers
reported slumping car sales, while leading companies such as Sears,
Digital Equipment and McDonald's reported slumping earnings. The
stock market fretted and took a sharp plunge early in the week.
   _Two of the most economically desperate countries followed
unusual strategies to market their raw materials. The Soviet Union,
starved for hard currency, appeared to reduce its support for black
African nationalism by agreeing to sell uncut diamonds through a
powerful cartel run by De Beers, South Africa's best-known company.
In the Middle East, Iraq threatened two OPEC neighbors with
military force unless they quit pumping excessive amounts of crude,
which the Iraqis claimed was depressing the price. Shortly
thereafter, the oil cartel reached an agreement to cut production
and raise the price.
   _Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, the best-known white collar
felons of high finance, were granted congressional immunity from
additional prosecution in exchange for their testimony about Wall
Street corruption and shady junk-bond dealings.

   With all the problems posed by a squeeze on
credit, some Wall Street analysts still believe the U.S. economy
can withstand the pressure without much widespread, long-term
damage.
   Indeed, they contend, the pain occurring now for the banking
business and its customers holds out the promise of future gains in
stability and the potential for growth.
   ``As lenders cut back, many worry that a credit shortfall might
stop the economy in its tracks,'' says Maureen Allyn, chief
economist at the New York investment management firm of Scudder,
Stevens &amp; Clark Inc.
   ``We think the pluses will continue to outweigh the minuses, and
the economy will avoid recession.''
   To many an armchair economist, the sight of a clampdown on
lending immediately evokes visions of a looming slump for workers,
consumers and businesses.
   In the 1980s, the reasoning goes, business and financial
activity was pumped up by a rapid expansion in the use of borrowed
money. Now that a restricted diet of credit has been prescribed,
belt-tightening would seem to be the order of the day.
   That certainly has been the case for the depressed home-building
and real estate markets in many areas of the country.
   But on an overall basis, Ms. Allyn maintains, a slowdown in
credit does not by itself guarantee an exactly parallel pattern in
economic growth.
   ``Some parts of the economy use more credit than others,'' she
points out. ``Real estate, for example, is voracious.
   ``During the last half of the 1980s, mortgages devoured over 40
percent of all new loans. Yet home and office building produced
only about 6 percent of the gross national product.
   ``On the other side of the ledger, exporting _ 14 percent of GNP
_ uses only a smidgen of borrowing now and then to finance
inventories or procure a letter of credit.
   ``The rising parts of the economy depend less on credit than the
slowing parts.''
   Government statistics made public on Friday showed growth in
output struggling along at a 1.2 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter of the year.
   That gave investors scant encouragement about the prospects for
improvement in corporate earnings, which lately have provoked more
than a few problems in the stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,898.51, down 62.63 from the week before. On Monday, the indicator
plunged sharply, falling more than 100 points at one time before
recovering, partly due to skepticism about economic and corporate
earnings prospects.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.33 to
193.32; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 12.68 to 442.59, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 4.96 at 355.49.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 171.72 million shares a day,
against 166.96 million the week before.
   ``Increasingly, it appears that the ongoing story for the 1990s
will be that of shrinkage of financial empires built on excessive
debt,'' said Vincent Agnew of the investment management group at
Chicago Title and Trust Co.
   ``So far, the negative impact of this trend has been more
pronounced in some areas of the country than others. But the
economy is now beginning to make some modest progress despite the
frugality that appears to be transforming the banking system.
   ``Our guess is the worst may be over and the short-term
dislocations may in fact enhance chances for a more upbeat economic
story in 1991.''

<HEAD>Business Week Reports `Best Companies For Women'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A half dozen U.S. corporations ranging from a
leading cosmetics maker to the parent publisher of USA Today are
among the best companies for working women, according to a business
magazine.
   Business Week magazine's cover story in Aug. 6 editions released
Friday said Avon Products, CBS, Dayton Hudson, Gannett, Kelly
Services, and US West Communications were leaders in corporate
efforts to promote what the magazine called ``woman-friendly
cultures.''
   The magazine also listed 12 companies in the next-best category
of ``Up-and Comers:'' American Express, Baxter International,
Corning, Honeywell, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Monsanto, Pitney
Bowes, Reader's Digest, Security Pacific Bank and Square D.
   It also listed an additional six in the No. 3 category of ``Late
Bloomers:'' Digital Equipment, Du Pont, Hewlett-Packard, Olin, 3M,
and Xerox.
   Business Week said it based the selections on several criteria,
including the numbers of women in key executive positions and on
the boards of directors, efforts to help women advance, and
sensitivity to family issues, such as child care and parental leave.
   The magazine is not the first publication to produce a
best-companies list for women. Working Woman and Working Mother
magazines also have done their own rankings in recent years.
   In 1988, two researchers, Baila Zeitz and Lorraine Dusky,
produced a widely quoted book called ``The Best Companies for
Women,'' a compilation of 50 companies with details on their
recruitment, promotion opportunities, salary, commitment to
equality, flexibility toward parental obligations and policies on
sexual harassment.
