   Three intellectuals who have been the government's
only vocal critics since the student movement for democracy was
suppressed last year disappeared on Thursday and their planned news
conference was canceled.
   It was not clear if the three former hunger strikers were
voluntarily maintaining a low profile or if they were taken into
custody.
   Sunday is the anniversary of last year's army attack on
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing that left hundreds dead and the
government has been tightening security measures in anticipation of
possible disturbances.
   Also on Thursday, Chinese newspapers reported 20 people were
executed for crimes, including a man convicted of destroying an Air
Force jeep during last June's uprising.
   The three intellectuals had planned to issue an open letter to
Chinese leaders calling for the release of political prisoners.
   Friends said two of the three who drafted the letter, folk singer
Hou Dejian and the former editor of a university newspaper, Gao Xin,
had not been seen since they left Hou's home early Thursday.
   Several hours later, Hou telephoned to say he was well but would
not be coming back for an unspecified time. Gao, 34, telephoned
later with a similar message.
   Hou, 34, also phoned two foreign journalists and said, ``Because
I personally have things to do, I'm not ready to hold a news
conference.'' He refused to elaborate.
   The third intellectual, Zhou Duo, 43, also dropped out of sight
on Thursday.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at the ministry's
weekly briefing later Thursday that Chinese were free to talk to
foreign journalists but ``a certain kind of formalities'' should be
observed for interviews. She did not comment directly on the case.
   Authorities may have been willing to tolerate their criticism
because it would have only reached a foreign audience and the three
were so open that they clearly were not involved in any underground
plotting.
   Holding a major news conference just days before the anniversary
may, however, been too great a provocation. Most of the foreign
journalists in Beijing were expected to cram Hou's tiny apartment
for the meeting.
   Sunday's edition of the official Sichuan Daily, seen in Beijing
on Thursday, said courts in the capital of Sichuan province last
week sentenced convicted arsonist Yu Yongchuan to death. He was
immediately executed.
   The newspaper said Yu led others in overturning a jeep and
setting it on fire during rioting that broke out in the capital,
Chengdu, on June 5, the day after the pro-democracy movement was
crushed.
   The other executed people were convicted of a variety of crimes.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders who worked together for
a decade to rid Poland of communism now find their unity rent by
differences over the pace and nature of change.
   The spectacle of this ``war at the top,'' to use Lech Walesa's
phrase, has dismayed activists. Some are choosing sides and others
hope to make peace between the factions.
   Walesa, who led the 1980 strike in which Solidarity was born,
brought the long-rumored tensions into the open in April.
   His method was public criticism aimed at the government of Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the parliamentary caucus led by
Bronislaw Geremek. Both are intellectuals and Solidarity advisers
who owe their positions to the shipyard electrician from Gdansk.
   Walesa said he had been silent too long. He accused the
government of advocating a ``steered democracy,'' one that limits
dissent, because it thinks it has all the answers. He said the
Communist system was being dismantled too slowly and people were
dissatisfied.
   ``Walesa feels the mood of the people very well and the people
are getting impatient,'' especially for political changes, said
Zdzislaw Najder, whom Walesa has named chairman of Solidarity's
national Citizens Committee.
   Mazowiecki's defenders say Walesa is motivated by personal
restlessness and an ambition to be president. They say his criticism
threatens to stir unrest when the government needs calm to obtain
Western investment and accomplish difficult economic reforms.
   ``No reasonable person can see any monopolization of power,''
Aleksander Malachowski, a Solidarity member of Parliament, said in
an interview, but added that some ``demagogues'' sought excuses to
attack the government.
   ``Very often in (Walesa's) statements you can see reflections of
this demagoguery,'' Malachowski said. ``He probably does not realize
it.''
   The dispute seems to signal a turning away from the 1989 ``round
table'' accord in which Solidarity agreed to a transitional stage of
coexistence with the Communists, who still held most of the power.
   With the collapse of Communist control throughout Eastern Europe,
Poland has become a rarity where former party leaders retain titular
positions of power, including the presidency and high posts in the
military, police and Parliament.
   They have kept their places largely by not disturbing the
decisions of Mazowiecki and the Solidarity parliamentary caucus.
   Walesa speaks for those who want to end the artificial
arrangement as quickly as possible. Mazowiecki's allies worry about
upsetting a balance that has worked so well.
   While Walesa says ``the intellectuals'' misled him, some of them
hint he is losing his renowned political instincts.
   ``You are making mistakes in many areas,'' foreign affairs
specialist Kazimierz Wojcicki lectured the Solidarity chairman May
13, in a stormy session of the Citizens Committee.
   ``You use terminology that confuses us,'' he said. ``You start a
presidential campaign and then retract it. ... You make us all
nervous at a moment when our economic reforms are entering a key
stage.''
   There also has been sniping between the daily Gazeta Wyborcza and
weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc, two newspapers founded by Solidarity.
They are edited, respectively, by Adam Michnik, an intellectual
perhaps best known for his ``Letters from Prison,'' and Jaroslaw
Kaczynski, a Walesa loyalist.
   Who will succeed President Wojciech Jaruzelski has become the
subject of sometimes acrimonious debate. It is assumed the former
Communist Party chief will have to step down before the formal end
of his term in 1995.
   Walesa clearly wants the job and Kaczynski has organized a
political group called the Center Alliance to support the candidacy.
   From the other side, suggestions are being circulated, sometimes
even printed, that Walesa is too impulsive and does not have the
learning or manners the presidency requires.
   Malachowski and some others in Parliament and the government say
Mazowiecki, who was little known until Walesa made him prime
minister in August, is a better presidential candidate.
   How could people who fought and suffered so long together, with
the notion of ``solidarity'' as their highest value, fall out so
soon after their hour of triumph?
   In part, the dissolution of their common foe, the Communist
Party, has released various conflicts within Solidarity: left-right,
worker-intellectual, Warsaw-provinces.
   ``Now the most difficult moment has come, because we don't have
anyone to fight against,'' actress Maja Komorowska said at the May
13 meeting.
   ``We are all victims of 45 years of Communist rule and of the
lack of democracy,'' said Najder, who recently returned from exile.
``We know how to fight our enemies, but we don't know how to coexist
as allies.''
   He also said in an interview he felt the differences between
Walesa and Mazowiecki were blown out of proportion.
   ``We have democracy, but when there are differences of opinion,
people are aghast,'' he said. ``If somebody criticizes the
government, they think he or she wants to bring down the government.
... It's absurd.''
   At the same Citizens Committee meeting where he spoke of the
``war at the top,'' Walesa praised the government and the Solidarity
leadership in Parliament, Najder said.
   Walesa said his criticism was meant to help the government by
providing a safety vent for growing public frustration.
   According to Najder, the dispute developed because Walesa is in
close touch with public feelings and wants to create a ``more open
political game'' by opposing ``monopolistic tendencies'' in
Parliament.
   He said government leniency about pensions for former officials
and its mild attitude on recovering property taken by the Communist
Party were ``incomprehensible'' to some Solidarity supporters.
   The government also may be guilty of ``excessive sensitivity,''
Najder said. The returned exile, a former director of Radio Free
Europe's Polish section, was sentenced to death in absentia by the
Communist regime.
   Malachowski, who wants Walesa to continue as Solidarity chairman
instead of becoming Poland's president, said years of joint struggle
had forged links among Solidarity activists that ``occasional
arguments'' could not break.
   Mrs. Komorowska, the actress, said the relationsship between
Walesa and the intellectuals should be like a marriage, and observed:
   ``It is a bad marriage where the couple does not sit down at the
table in the evening and say to each other what is painful.''

<TEXT>
   He once was the man of the hour, the
latest strongman installed by the army to lead Guatemala out of
corruption, insurrection and bloodshed.
   Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a born-again Christian with a
charismatic style, presided over times of masked tribunals and
firing squads, of army massacres that shocked the world.
   When a coup deposed him in 1983, after 16 months as president,
Rios Montt seemed consigned to political obscurity.
   His ambition, like his faith, has been resurrected and he is
running for president as a civilian. Rios Montt is a serious
contender scoring high in the polls, a candidate of crisis.
   Five years of democracy have not brought clean, effective
government or ended violence and human rights abuses. Street crime
is rampant, drug trafficking on the rise, the economy unraveling.
   ``It is a moral crisis, an ethical crisis, a failure of hope,''
said Juan Luis Bosch, a leading businessman. ``People put their
hope in a democratic government, but hope has become
disillusionment.''
   Things seem to be spinning out of control and Rios Montt offers
to put them right. He is a law-and-order candidate with an Old
Testament style, stern and paternal.
   ``Guatemala needs a man of character, a man who knows and
enforces the law,'' the 63-year-old retired brigadier general said
in an interview. ``Not a dictator. A man of law.''
   Rios Montt's law was harsh.
   He imposed a state of siege and created special tribunals where
masked ``judges'' tried hundreds of people for crimes including
sabotage, possession of explosives and the sale of weapons to
people deemed subversive.
   ``Only 15 people were ultimately sentenced to death, but it was
a great scandal because we shot five when the pope was here,'' Rios
Montt said.
   Pope John Paul II made a personal plea for clemency during his
1983 Central America tour.
   ``It would have been easier to shoot them and just dump them in
the trash, but that wouldn't have been justice,'' Rios Montt said,
curtly closing the subject.
   During his presidency, the army continued a vicious
counterinsurgency campaign to destroy any potential base of support
for leftist guerrillas among the peasants.
   It led to ``the gravest violations of human rights ... including
the destruction and sacking of entire villages and massacres of the
inhabitants,'' the human rights commission of the Organization of
American States said in 1983.
   Now, an almost nostalgic glow seems to bathe Rios Montt's reign;
the worldwide condemnation of human rights abuses seems forgotten.
   ``You talk to the average person here about human rights and it
means getting on a bus and not being robbed,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``That is what makes Rios Montt's message so powerful.''
   People speak of how his stern measures seemed to work, how the
army's scorched-earth campaign in the countryside dimmed the
leftist insurgency, how city streets were safe and official
corruption waned.
   ``He is seen as an upright man, a person of principles and
order, someone who will end the violence and corruption,'' said
Fernando Hurtado, deputy attorney general for human rights. ``He is
someone who, in a time of crisis, stresses values.''
   Central America's most populous nation seems caught in a time
warp. Turn on television and there is Rios Montt again, talking
about law and order, the family and clean government, just as he
did in evangelistic Sunday homilies as president.
   More than half a dozen candidates are seeking the presidency,
encouraged by the vulnerability of the incumbent Christian
Democrats, who are widely seen as corrupt and inept.
   Rios Montt is running as an independent. Political observers say
they detect little solid support for him in the two most powerful
segments of Guatemalan society: the army and business.
   ``I have the support of the people,'' he said in the interview.
``That is what matters.''
   The most serious obstacle to his candidacy is a constitution
that appears to bar former dictators _ heads of ``de facto''
governments _ from becoming president.
   Rios Montt says the 1985 constitution is not retroactive and he
will run despite an adverse advisory opinion from the
Constitutional Court. The opinion was requested by the legislature
and is not binding.
   The former general predicted his followers will start a civil
uprising if election authorities refuse to let him register when
they meet in June to set an election date and register candidates.
   ``It will be the people, not the army,'' he said. ``An army
uprising doesn't interest me. Coups don't interest me.''
   He grabbed a well-thumbed copy of the constitution, with key
passages highlighted in yellow ink or underlined in red, and
thumped a clause he says makes such an uprising legal.
   ``It says here that people have the right to defend their
rights, and they have a right to vote for me,'' he said.
   His interest in constitutional law is relatively new. One of his
first acts after a March 1982 coup put him in power was to revoke
the 1965 constitution, suspend political activity and cancel
election laws.
   Rios Montt, a member of the Church of the Word, based in
California, says he does not intend to revive the special tribunals
or military rule. Instead, he proposes an extensive system of
locally elected judges.
   ``No more tanks, no more planes, no more soldiers,'' he said.
``More justice.''
   His human rights record could make him unacceptable to many
other governments if he becomes president.
   Publicly, the United States is neutral. Privately, U.S.
officials say aid might be cut if Rios Montt wins.
   Rios Montt said his election could provoke a U.S. invasion or
assassination attempt.
   ``Do something like Panama. Shoot me. End everything,'' he said,
spitting out the words.
   Rios Montt's administration was the last but one in a 30-year
line of military or military-dominated governments that began with
a U.S.-sponsored coup in 1954.
   He dismisses criticism of his army's counterinsurgency campaign,
echoing former President Reagan's comment in 1982 that the general
got a ``bum rap.''
   ``They blamed me for what Lucas did, but they knew I had an
honest government,'' he said, referring to his predecessor, Gen.
Fernando Romeo Lucas.

<HEAD>Trade Pact Seen as Trophy Gorbachev Wants Most</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Mikhail Gorbachev fails to bring home a
signed trade agreement from his summit meeting with President Bush,
it will be another blow to a Soviet economy that is already
reeling, analysts say.
   Both Gorbachev and President Bush have put major emphasis on a
new trade agreement as the primary way the United States can
provide economic support for Gorbachev's reform program.
   ``It is a very important trophy for Gorbachev. It won't solve
all of his economic problems, but not getting a deal will hurt,''
said Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert at Harvard University.
   The pact would normalize trade relations between the two
superpowers for the first time in nearly a half century and clear
the way for significantly lower tariffs on Soviet products. It
would also expand business opportunites for American companies in
the Soviet Union.
   Donald Bowles, an economics professor at American University,
said that given the food shortages and other problems besetting the
Soviet economy, the boost from a trade agreement should not be
underestimated.
   ``The more quickly that we can normalize relationships, the
better we can make things for the Soviet people generally,'' he
said. ``That is in our long-term interests.''
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators reached basic agreement on the trade
pact on April 25 with administration officials expressing optimism
a month ago that a few minor loose ends could be resolved in time
for Bush and Gorbachev to sign the document during this week's
summit.
   Although the administration has not ruled out a signing cremony
during the four-day summit, the outlook has grown considerably less
certain.
   At first, the administration said it would not sign a trade
agreement until the Soviet parliament put into law liberalized
emigration policies for Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   But now the administration, seeking to influence Gorbachev's
handling of the Lithuanian independence movement, has linked a
trade agreement with the lifting of Moscow's economic blockade on
the breakaway republic.
   While Bush is being pressured by many members of Congress to
hold firm to this position, some U.S. business groups were lobbying
the administration to go ahead and sign a trade deal.
   The National Association of Manufacturers sent Bush a letter
Wednesday saying that the first role of U.S. trade policy was to
advance America's competitive standing in the world, not to serve
as a ``poor foreign policy messenger.''
   ``Without some clear indication that the pending U.S.-Soviet
trade agreement will be implemented, American business proposals
will get short shrift in the Soviet Union compared with those from
Europe and Japan,'' wrote NAM President Jerry Jasinowski.
   The trade agreement is needed to grant the Soviet Union ``most
favored nation status,'' qualifying it for the lowest tariffs
granted to any other country. Currently, Soviet products sold in
the United States bear duties as much as 10 times higher than
imports from other countries. By one estimate, the price of Soviet
vodka could drop by $1.25 per bottle.
   U.S. officials have estimated that the $5 billion in annual
trade between the Soviet Union and the United States could double
or even triple over the next three years with a new trade agreement.
   In addition to the lower tariffs, the agreement includes a
number of provisions aimed at expanding foreign business
opportunities. The agreement would provide better copyright
protection for American companies and cut down on the time U.S.
companies have to wait for approval for commercial operations in
the Soviet Union.
   The agreement would also clear the way for American companies
doing business with the Soviets to be eligible for
government-subsidized loans from the Export-Import Bank and the
Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   Analysts said this provision was significant because it would
expand the number of U.S. companies interested in setting up joint
ventures in the Soviet Union, a key goal of Gorbachev's economic
reforms.
   The dire economic situation in the Soviet Union was emphasized
during a pre-summit press conference Wednesday conducted by a group
of Soviet economists who discussed with unusual candor the slumping
Soviet economy, which has been beset by food shortages, labor
strikes and high inflation.
   ``Everything we have done so far were half measures. One step
forward and two steps backwards,'' said Vladlen Martynov, director
of the Soviet Institute of World Economics and International
Relations.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ally Sheedy, Robert Blake and Polly Draper
turned out for gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein. Jack
Lemmon and James Garner made TV commercials against a pair of
Republican-backed redistricting measures.
   But for the most part, Hollywood's big names are sitting out the
June 5 primary, saving their star power for the general election,
especially for the Big Green environmental initiative celebrity
drive headed by Jane Fonda.
   ``Primaries are too divisive,'' explained Shana Weiss of the
Hollywood Women's Political Committee. ``Unless there is a
compelling, principled reason to endorse someone, the celebrities
are going to wait.''
   Feinstein is battling state Attorney General John Van de Kamp
for the Democratic nomination for governor. U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson
is the favorite to win the GOP nomination.
   A Feinstein fund-raiser drew some stars, and a GOP fund-raiser
that indirectly helped Wilson attracted Charlton Heston, Bob Hope
and Chuck Norris. Van de Kamp appears to have garnered no strong
celebrity support. No celebrities have been seen at his
fund-raisers and his campaign could not provide the name of a
single big-name backer.
   Oddly, it wasn't the usually Hollywood-hip issues of abortion or
the environment that got Lemmon and Garner involved.
   They gave their support to opponents of Propositions 118 and
119, initiatives that would dramatically change the way the state
draws legislative and congressional boundaries based on the latest
census figures.
   One measure would require a two-thirds vote of the legislature
to approve reapportionment plans rather than the current simple
majority. The other would take redistricting power away from the
legislature and give it to an independent commission. Both have
heavy Republican backing.
   The commercials touched such a nerve among many Republicans that
GOP Gov. George Deukmejian, who backs the measures, assailed the
celebrity support and noted that in 1984 a similar ad campaign
helped defeat a redistricting effort.
   ``The opponents are again using a Hollywood star with a message
of misrepresentation,'' Deukmejian said.
   The other initiatives, however, have lacked star appeal: The
celebrities didn't offer and the campaigns didn't call.
   ``We're just not trying to sell it that way,'' said Bob Schmidt
with the gas tax initiative, Proposition 111, and a companion
measure, Proposition 108. ``Frankly, in any of the strategy
conferences, we've never even discussed getting any celebrity
types.''
   Feinstein, the former San Francisco mayor in a close race with
Van de Kamp, got a good celebrity showing at a May 5 fund-raiser at
the home of feminist lawyer Gloria Allred.
   ``As an almost lifelong Republican, I am no longer deluded and
I'm delighted to support Dianne,'' said Richard Paul, star of the
``Carter Country'' television series.
   But Feinstein's star support is low-profile at best. None of the
celebrities has been seen stumping for her and many of the stars at
the fund-raiser declined to comment on their political leanings.
   Among them was Dana Delaney of television's ``China Beach.''
   ``Dana just didn't think it was something she wanted to talk
about,'' said her publicist, Heidi Schaeffer.
   Wilson also has lukewarm support from Hollywood. The February
event that drew Hope, Heston and Norris was technically for the
state Republican Party, not Wilson's campaign, and an appearance by
President Bush was the draw.
   Although Van de Kamp has not stirred up Hollywood interest, the
Big Green measure he co-sponsors with Assemblyman Tom Hayden,
D-Santa Monica, has the entertainment world buzzing.
   The sweeping environmental initiative has lined up the support
of Miss Fonda, Meryl Streep, Robin Williams, Ted Danson, Candice
Bergen, Billy Crystal, Martin Short, Chevy Chase, Barbra Streisand,
Ed Begley Jr. and Donna Mills.

<HEAD>Bush Sets Out Johnson China, Homebred Opera for Gorbachev Dinner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush is laying out the china _ though
not the dishes that got Nancy Reagan in trouble _ for a spectacular
evening of socializing and opera at tonight's dinner for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa.
   Last-minute details, including finishing touches on the menu,
were being completed in secrecy today as White House social
officials prepared for the hottest social event of the year.
   First lady Barbara Bush's office, which oversees planning for
state dinners, released minimal information in advance, saying the
details could not be divulged until all was absolutely ready.
   But a few glimpses of the evening's promise penetrated the
secrecy shield.
   The feature entertainment will be American opera singer
Frederica von Stade, considered one of the world's foremost
mezzo-sopranos.
   The New Jersey-born von Stade has sung with most of the nation's
major opera companies, including the Washington Opera, and has
performed all over the world. She is particularly renowned for her
French repertoire, especially the role of Cinderella in the opera
``Cendrillon'' by Jules Massenet.
   The White House planned to set out dishes bought during
President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration, which Nancy Reagan
once described as just not elegant enough for a state dinner.
   Mrs. Reagan ordered new china. She later wrote in her
autobiography, ``My Turn,'' that the purchase became ``a symbol of
my supposed extravagance,'' even though the bill was picked up by
the Knapp Foundation, not the taxpayers.
   The set left behind by the Johnsons, Mrs. Reagan wrote, ``did
not include serving platters, finger bowls, dessert bowls and
bouillon cups. And while the Johnson china was lovely, with the
various state flowers around the edge, it was more suitable for a
luncheon than a formal state dinner.''
   Maybe so, but Mrs. Bush chose to use that dishware, rather than
Nancy Reagan's, for reasons left unsaid _ if not obvious. Simply
put, Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev never hit it off, as the former
first lady acknowledged in her book. The relationship, she said,
``obviously had been difficult for both of us.''
   The administration's chief of protocol, Ambassador Joseph V.
Reed, confirmed the Bushes themselves took a strong hand in
planning the dinner. As he put it: ``It has their personal stamp of
American elegance on it.''
   The menu features ``classic continental cuisine,'' said Mrs.
Bush's press secretary Anna Perez. She provided no specifics. As is
customary, domestic wine will be served.
   During dessert, the Air Force strolling strings orchestra will
perform for the dinner guests.
   Before and after dinner, the Marine orchestra will play in the
White House grand entrance hall where dancing is the custom after
guests sit for the entertainment in the East Room.
   The dinner also affords an opportunity for the two presidents to
exchange pleasantries in formal toasts, which are often political
in nature.
   The tightly-held guest list included such American luminaries as
Academy-Award winning actor Jessica Tandy, Tandy's husband, Hume
Cronyn, actor Morgan Freeman and NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw,
sources said. Tandy and Freeman starred together in last year's
Academy Award best picture ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   The Gorbachevs also will have a chance to mingle with the
Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, also among the
invitees.
   The 130-person guest list was rounded out by assorted political,
social, athletic and entertainment world figures.
   Some questions remained open:
   Would the Gorbachevs take a whirl around the dance floor? The
Bushes always dance a number or two, but whether their more
reserved Soviet guests would follow suit was not known.
   Would Bush and Gorbachev call each other by first names in the
formal toasts? Bush frequently addresses his foreign guests by
first name, but it remained unclear whether Gorbachev would accept
that level of intimacy with the American president.
   So far in their public comments, Bush and Gorbachev have
addressed one another formally, as ``Mr. President.''
   The Gorbachevs will reciprocate as hosts on Friday night, when
they hold a dinner for the Bushes at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington.

   If no superpower trade agreement is
signed during the Washington summit, the plight of Yuri Semenenko
may be one small reason why.
   Semenenko holds a U.S. passport by virtue of his birth in
Portland, Oregon, 45 years ago, but he still is unable to leave the
Soviet Union.
   The catch: he also holds a Soviet passport, and visa officials
say he cannot leave until he gives it up _ and only they can decide
if and when he can do that.
   Semenenko served five years in prison camps on what he said were
trumped-up criminal charges connected to his effort to obtain a
U.S. passport in the early 1980s.
   For him, the political and economic reforms for which the world
has praised President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``are changes in words
only.''
   ``In deeds, nothing has changed,'' said Semenenko, a trim tennis
fanatic and former motocross racer.
   Even though he knows Portland only through old photographs, he
would like to take his wife, Yelena, a ballet dancer, and newborn
daughter to the city to live.
   ``I have some kind of feeling that the city is my home, some
kind of ties there,'' he said.
   Travel and emigration from the Soviet Union have reached record
levels under Gorbachev. An Israeli immigration agency reported in
January that 71,509 Jews left the Soviet Union in 1989, the highest
total in about two decades.
   But many say Gorbachev's reforms have been limited. Soviet Jews
plan to demonstrate in Moscow during the superpower summit to make
their point.
   Soviet officials long have promised a new emigration law to
remove obstacles, and President Bush has set that as a criterion
for easing trade restrictions against the Soviet Union.
   Under a 1974 U.S. law, the Soviet Union has been denied the
benefits of Most Favored Nation trading status because of its
repressive policies toward the emigration of Soviet Jews and other
minorities.
   Bush administration officials have worked on the final wording
of a trade agreement, but it was unclear whether it would be put on
the table during the summit without a new Soviet emigration law.
Gorbachev's economic crackdown on Lithuania was also hindering an
accord, officials said.
   In November, the Supreme Soviet legislature gave preliminary
approval to a bill that would allow emigration for virtually anyone
who has entry permission from another country and no outstanding
alimony obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state
secrets.
   It sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be
kept from emigrating because of access to secrets. Nevertheless,
Jewish activists claim the bill is vaguely worded and might still
be used to restrict emigration.
   There are indications the bill might come up for debate soon,
but it has proved little comfort to Semenenko and others caught in
the slow grind of Soviet bureaucracy.
   Semenenko is the son of a Soviet military officer assigned to
oversee Lend-Lease shipments in World War II and is American by
virtue of his birth in Portland's Wilcox Memorial Hospital on Feb.
10, 1945.
   His family left the United States several months after
Semenenko's birth and he has lived since then in the Soviet Union.
   Ten years ago he learned he was eligible for U.S. citizenship
and in March 1989 obtained a U.S. passport, after being released
from prison camp, where he served time on charges of bribery and
hooliganism.
   He began seeking permission from the Soviet Union to leave, but
was told only the Soviet government could decide whether and when
he can give up his Soviet citizenship.
   The bureaucracy's gears moved another notch in February.
Leningrad visa officials invited him to fill out an application to
give up citizenship, and pay a fee of 500 rubles, about twice the
monthly wage for an average factory worker.
   But nothing has happened since he paid the fee and filled out
the form. Semenenko said calls to the local visa office indicated
the documents still have not been transmitted to Moscow for
approval.
   To Semenenko that means ``my documents are with the KGB, and the
visa office can't do anything about it.'' There is no way to guess
if the secret police will sign off on his departure, he said.
   As the Soviet Union struggles through economic failure, ethnic
tension and political upheaval, Semenenko said it does not matter
what kind of life he finds in the United States.
   ``Sitting here, it's impossible to construct any kind of
possibilities for the future,'' he said. ``I'm ready for any kind
of work.''

<HEAD>600 Essayists in Search of a Respectable Ruble</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   It has come to this with the Russian currency.
So great is its trouble _ so low its value _ that an essay contest
was held on ways to rescue the ruble. Six hundred ideas came from
23 countries.
   Frank Furth, a wealthy Californian who put up $42,000 in prize
money, said the idea came to him when a Soviet guest visiting his
ranch asked if he had any suggestions on how to make the ruble
convertible _ worth something outside of the U.S.S.R.
   His suggestion was to have the contest.
   If the ruble isn't convertible, no one wants it. It can't be
cashed in for other currencies. When Pepsi-Cola set up shop in the
Soviet Union, it worked out a deal to sell Pepsi for rubles, buy
vodka with the rubles, export the vodka, then sell the vodka and
make its profit that way.
   It works, but it's clumsy. Economists talk about liquidity, but
that's not what they have in mind.
   The judges _ three American academics, three Russian experts _
went over the finalists and awarded $10,000 prizes Wednesday to two
Russians, Giuzel Anulova and K. Panov, and an economics professor
from Tufts University, Franklyn Holzman.
   They gave $4,000 prizes to the runners-up, a Russian, a West
German and a Hungarian.
   The top winners called, one way or another, for creation of a
market economy in the Soviet Union as the only effective path to
ruble respectability. The others called, one way or another, for a
dual economy, which might, or might not, lead to a convertible
ruble, the judges said.
   The judges issued a statement: ``After two days of intense
discussion, the jury came away impressed with the difficulties
involved in devising a workable strategy for achieving a
convertible ruble, and also with the immense importance of making
headway on this issue.''
   Furth, antitrust lawyer and owner of a California winery, said
essays came in from ``the cognoscente of convertibility,'' showing
``that the world was responding to a chance to help.''
   Economist Ed Hewitt of the Brookings Institution said he would
have been ``chagrined'' if one of the entries had won. It came from
a sixth grader, not otherwise identified.
   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. State Commission on
Foreign Economic Relations, promised to call a conference in Moscow
in October toweigh the ideas further.
   All this happened at the Brookings Institution. Over at the
National Press Club, five Soviet officials in grey suits lined up
behind microphones and took turns for an hour taking aim at the
Soviet economy, no punches pulled.
   ``There is absolutely no logic to our pricing system,'' said
Vladlen Arkadyevich Martynov, director of the Academy of Sciences
Institute of World Economics and International Relations.
   ``We have ludicrously low prices on bread, which results in that
bread being fed to animals or even being used as fertilizer. ... We
must re-educate 100 percent of our managers.''
   For all that, Andrei Grachev, an official of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, said it would be appropriate for
capitalism to lend a hand to a communist economy trying to reform
itself.
   Said he: ``I would hope that the West would take some
responsibilities in perestroika.''

   Some timber workers have a beef with Burger
King over its use of Paul Newman salad dressing.
   Forty-three sales employees at Willamette Industries sent a
letter to Boss Enterprises, which runs eight local Burger King
outlets, asking the company to stop using Newman's Own.
   Newman's company donates profits to environmentalist groups who
the timber workers believe want to take the food from their mouths.
   Their May 16 letter cited Newman's narration of a National
Audubon Society TV special last fall on a dispute between
environmentalists and loggers.
   ``This show was pro-preservationist and for the shutting down of
all logging in the Northwest,'' the letter read. ``We do not feel
it is right that we contribute to the demise of our industry.''
   Boss Enterprises co-owner Bob Boss said he had no plans to
discontinue using Newman's Own, which he said has a contract with
Burger King.
   ``It's not our own personal support of his causes,'' he said.

   Comic Jay Leno will donate royalties from his
book ``Headlines'' to a charity that helps children stricken with
AIDS.
   ``My manager had a 3-year-old baby that died of AIDS and at the
time people thought it couldn't happen to them,'' Leno said
Wednesday.
   Profits from the book, a collection of wacky newspaper headlines
that has sold more than 250,000 copies, will go to the Samuel Jared
Kushnick Foundation, founded by his manager, Helen Kushnick. Leno
said he didn't know how much money was involved.
   Kushnick's son died in 1983 after receiving an AIDS-tainted
blood transfusion.
   She said Leno's effort ``makes me feel Sam didn't die in vain.''

   The British press applauded John Malkovich for his
British stage debut in the Broadway play ``Burn This.''
   Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail said Malkovich gave ``a
performance of wall-blasting intensity'' at the Hampstead Theater.
   Malkovich, star of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Places in the
Heart,'' is reprising the role he played on Broadway for six months
in the 1987-88 season.
   Lanford Wilson's play casts the 36-year-old actor as Pale, a
foul-mouthed restaurant manager who embarks on a relationship with
his dead brother's roommate, a dancer named Anna. She is played by
British actress Juliet Stevenson.
   Michael Billington in The Guardian said the star's ``riveting''
performance confirmed his belief that Malkovich is ``the most
exciting American actor to emerge since Brando.''

   ABC fibbed when it said Laura Palmer's murder
would be solved in the season finale of ``Twin Peaks,'' executive
producer Mark Frost says _ but withholding the whodunit seems to
have gotten the series renewed.
   ``We had no guarantee that ABC would ever renew us,'' he said
Tuesday in a telephone interview from Hawaii. ``I intentionally
structured that last hour so that if ABC was really curious about
who killed Laura, they'd have to pick up the show.
   ``Our sole strategy was survival. By withholding the identity of
the killer, we thought we were down to our last coin.''
   An ABC spokesman said early this month that the mystery would be
solved in the last episode, which was last week. On Wednesday,
spokesman Bob Wright changed his tune.
   ``I was always under the assumption that the central part of the
story pertaining to the murder would be resolved,'' he said. ``I
was wrong. From now on, I will not make any promises about `Twin
Peaks.'''
   ``Twin Peaks'' will be back in the fall, along with, Frost
hopes, disappointed viewers who charted every dizzying turn of the
show's nine hours trying to figure out who murdered the sleepy
Northwest lumber town's homecoming queen.
   On April 8, television was introduced to a world out of kilter,
confected by Frost and film director David Lynch, who made ``Blue
Velvet.''
   The ratings were only mediocre, but fans threw ``Twin Peaks''
parties and more was written about the program than any other in
recent memory.

<HEAD>Weary Gorbachev Will Rap with Private Americans as Well as Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top likely after 10 a.m. EDT meeting</NOTE>

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's first full day of
summitry mixes weighty sessions at the White House and private time
during which he will play luncheon host to a group of
yet-to-be-identified American intellectuals.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his stylish wife, Raisa, arrived from
Ottawa, Canada, for the four-day U.S.-Soviet summit late Wednesday.
   He looked slightly weary as he stepped off his jet, but said he
was keen to see Bush.
   ``This is the first time that the president ... and I will have
enough time to reflect on and discuss _ not only in a formal
setting but also in a more informal surrounding one-on-one _ all
the questions either of us might have that fall within our
responsibility,'' Gorbachev said in brief remarks at a red-carpet
welcoming ceremony at nearby Andrews Air Force Base.
   Gorbachev will meet twice with Bush at the White House today and
attend a state dinner in the evening. After more sessions Friday,
the pair will relax at Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat in
Maryland on Saturday.
   Also on today's agenda is the luncheon for American thinkers.
That will be at the Soviet Embassy, where Gorbachev is staying,
about six blocks from the White House. The Soviets have kept the
guest list closely held.
   When Gorbachev arrived at the embassy, he was greeted by gawkers
and protesters. One small group of people chanted ``Stop killing
Armenians,'' and another carried signs reading, ``No tanks in
Lithuania.''
   Gorbachev's car was in a motorcade of more than 50 vehicles.
   Earlier, as his Zil limousine drove down Connecticut Avenue,
Gorbachev's window was open. Gorbachev waved and smiled at people
along the sidewalk, who applauded.
   The promise of an agreement reducing strategic nuclear arms was
high on his wish list, Gorbachev said. He and Bush were sure to get
down to that topic at their first meeting this morning.
   Other issues likely to be addressed included a chemical weapons
ban, the role of conventional forces in Europe, the unification of
Germany, the future of the Baltic Republics, and, according to Bush
aides, Gorbachev's domestic problems.
   Those may have taken a turn for the worse Wednesday with an
announcement by Boris Yeltsin, the newly elected Russian president,
that he'll seek sovereignty for the largest Soviet republic within
his first 100 days in office.
   Yeltin, a political threat to Gorbachev from the left, said he
would try to mend fences with Gorbachev, but outlined a program of
economic and social reform must broader than Gorbachev's.
   Already, the economic reforms initiated by Gorbachev have caused
increases in food prices.
   The sad shape of the Soviet economy _ and Gorbachev's desire to
improve ties with capitalist countries _ must have been a factor in
the Soviet leader's decision to meet with South Korea's president
next week in San Francisco, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   Moscow and Seoul have no formal diplomatic relations, and
Gorbachev's decision to hold the meeting represents the strongest
Soviet gesture yet toward South Korea.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo on Monday in San Francisco, where he also will see Ronald
Reagan and former Secretary of State George Shultz.

   ``Newhart'' went out with a bang, ending its
eight-year run on CBS with the most-watched show of the week.
   It was the first No. 1 finish for ``Newhart'' since 1983, but
NBC remained the top-rated network overall, according to figures
Wednesday from the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   With the May sweeps over, the Big Three now head straight for
summer rerun season. Ratings during the sweeps period are used to
set local advertising rates.
   NBC had an 11.1 average for last week, well ahead of ABC with
10.4. CBS had four of the top 10 shows on television last week but
was in its usual last-place spot, with a 10. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 households.
   The last episode of ``Newhart'' _ which saw the Stratford Inn in
danger of being purchased by the Japanese and Bob Newhart awakening
next to Suzanne Pleshette (his wife from ``The Bob Newhart Show''
in the 1970s) and realizing the last eight years were just a dream
_ drew an 18.7 rating.
   NBC dominated with reruns of mega-hits such as ``Cheers,'' which
finished second, ``A Different World,'' which landed in sixth
place, and ``The Cosby Show,'' which came in eighth.
   The season finale of CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' which married off
the annoyingly cheerful Corky, was third.
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' which has consistently
placed in the top five for ABC, plummeted to 18th.
   More than half the top 50 shows last week were repeats.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
``Newhart,'' CBS, 18.7; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 18.3; ``Murphy Brown,''
CBS, 17.7; ``Designing Women,'' CBS, 17.2; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 16.1;
``A Different World,'' NBC, 15.9; CBS Tuesday Movie ``A Killing in
A Small Town,'' 15.8; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 15.7; ``ABC Sunday
Night Movie'' tied with ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 15.5.
   In the evening news, ABC was No. 1 for the 20th consecutive week
with an average of 9.3. CBS had an 8.5 and NBC a 7.8.

   By presidential decree, government
employees will be able to put aside their work and watch Costa Rica
play in its first World Cup soccer tournament.
   ``I'm not going to miss the game. So it's fair that all public
employees, for two hours, have the right to watch it in their
places of work,'' President Rafael Angel Calderon said after
signing the decree Wednesday.
   Two of Costa Rica's first three games will be on weekdays, in
the morning local time.
   ``Employees will have permission from 9 a.m. until 11:30 a.m.
local time. After that, everybody to work,'' Calderon said.
   The team caused national jubilation when it became the first to
qualify for a World Cup in Costa Rican history.
   The first match is June 11 against Scotland in Genoa. The other
opponents in Group C are Brazil and Sweden.
   Calderon had planned to go to Italy for the matches but later
decided to send his son instead.

   Vincent ``The Chin'' Gigante is no dapper don:
he prefers a bathrobe and pajamas to a silk shirt and designer
suits and wears slippers instead of Guccis as he rambles through
the streets of Greenwich Village.
   But authorities say that Gigante's befuddled ways are a dodge
and that the reputed boss of the Genovese crime family is every bit
as ruthless as the better-known, better-dressed John Gotti. Gigante
even put a contract out on Gotti in 1987, authorities in New Jersey
allege.
   Gigante, who until now had been untouched by a government
crackdown on the Mafia, was among 15 people from four mob families
charged Wednesday with monopolizing the installation of windows in
the city's housing projects since 1978.
   The business brought mob companies more than $191 million,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   Andrew Maloney, U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said the cooperative
effort by the four rival families was an unusual arrangement,
prompted by the profits available. Gigante mediated disputes
between the crime families, Maloney said.
   Gigante's brother and other family members says he's no don,
he's deranged. They maintain Gigante is mentally and physically
unfit to care for himself.
   Law enforcement officials reject the claim as bogus.
   ``He's crazy like a fox,'' FBI organized crime and narcotics
chief Jules J. Bonavolonta said last year.
   Gigante, 62, was in his robe and striped sleepwear when he was
arrested early Wednesday and charged with racketeering.
   The FBI says the Genovese family, with 250 members, is second
only to Gotti's Gambino crew in power and influence. The family
maintains a lock on waterfronts and unions in New York and New
Jersey, officials say.
   Gigante's alleged ascent to the top spot followed the 1986
racketeering conviction of his predecessor, Anthony ``Fat Tony''
Salerno. His organized crime career began more than three decades
earlier as a mob hit man, the FBI said. Investigators said his most
famous job was one he bungled, a 1957 hit on mob boss Frank
Costello.
   ``This is for you, Frank,'' Gigante allegedly announced before
firing a shot at Costello's head. Costello was only grazed. He
refused to identify his assailant.
   Gigante was acquitted; Costello retired and Vito Genovese
assumed control of the family that now carries his name.
   Investigators say Gigante, whose nickname apparently came from
an early boxing career, moved up through the ranks of the family,
his climb interrupted by a jail term from 1959 to 1964 on a heroin
charge.
   But since beating a 1970 bribery rap by pleading mental
incompetence, he has avoided prosecution.
   Authorities attribute Gigante's elusiveness to his bizarre
lifestyle. They say most of his conversations with mob colleagues
are conducted on long walks through Greenwich Village, far from the
wiretaps that brought down other crime bosses.
   Gigante is a familiar, shuffling presence on the streets of the
Village. Clad in a robe and mumbling incoherently, he strolls from
his headquarters, the Triangle Social Club, to a store across the
street. He sits and plays cards.
   FBI agents serving Gigante with a subpoena several years ago
found him standing naked in a shower holding an open umbrella.
   Gigante's brother, the Rev. Louis Gigante, a Roman Catholic
priest, tried unsuccessfully for years to have his brother declared
incompetent. He claims his brother's frequent visits to a
sanitarium are evidence of his mental anguish, and notes a
psychiatric report detailing Vincent's schizophrenia and
hallucinations.
   ``His mental state is such that he couldn't be the boss of a
candy store,'' Gigante attorney Barry Slotnick argued earlier this
year.
   Federal prosecutors, unswayed by such arguments, had targeted
Gigante as their No. 2 priority behind the thrice-acquitted Gotti.

   KARL-MARX-STADT, East Germany (AP) _ Karl Marx looks awfully
angry as he stares at a city that no longer practices his
principles and no longer wants his name.
   The imposing two-story bust of socialism's intellectual
architect rests on a massive block of granite in front of city
hall, staring stern-faced across a main avenue that also sports his
name.
   The area around it is empty of people, but nearby streets are
crawling with commerce. Hundreds of booths, stands and trucks
loaded with Western merchandise fill plazas and malls, the
frontline forces of capitalism's advancing army.
   Like virtually every other major population center in East
Germany, Karl Marx, the city, has become Karl Marx, the market, one
of the places to be if you have something to sell.
   ``You can do a lot of business here. It is incredible,'' said
Jochen Siebke, head of marketing for the West German branch of
Citroen, the French automaker.
   This 825-year-old city was known as Chemnitz until 1953, when
the former Communist government changed the name. In an April
referendum, 76 percent of those voting said the city of 308,000
should be changed back to Chemnitz.
   The city council has not yet formalized the change, however, and
the drab industrial town is known alternately by both names.
Highway signs switch back and forth, and the government news
agency, ADN, uses a ``Karl-Marx-Stadt@Chemnitz'' dateline on
stories from the city.
   If the city is still somewhat schizophrenic about its name,
there is little doubt about which ideology is prevailing.
   Furniture is peddled from the backs of trucks and a seemingly
endless string of booths sell everything from Barbie dolls to Black
&amp; Decker tools.
   In a plaza, models cavort to a Michael Jackson song and tout a
line of surf wear. The show takes place under a banner that says
``Test the West.'' West is a brand of cigarette.
   Citroen recently parked a dozen of its shiny cars on a dusty
parking lot in town, set up tables under red-and-white parasols and
blared music and commercials touting its sleek sets of wheels.
   The automaker wasn't necessarily looking to sell cars today,
Siebke said, but after July 2, when the German states merge their
economies and East Germans can convert their money to coveted West
German marks.
   ``You have to get out here, get you're name known,'' Siebke
said. ``It's in preparation for the whole economic union.''
   The cheapest car sells for about $9,000 _ about $1,800 more than
the average East German's annual salary.
   About half of the people who come by cannot pay, and many work
in outmoded industries that are likely to face high unemployment,
Siebke says.
   ``We don't press people to buy,'' he said.
   But he added that many people have large savings accounts.
   ``People have been saving for 20 years, but they have had
nothing to buy,'' he said. ``One man came here and he had a savings
account book with 500,000 East marks in it.''
   Under the conversion system, that will be worth about 252,000
West German marks or $152,000 after July 2.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere has urged East Germans to
refrain from spending their new currency so they will not erode its
value and cause inflation in both Germanys.
   But Wolfgang Hufenbecher, director of the West German
Commerzbank and the head of its new East German operation said the
influx of Western products may be too tempting.
   ``You can see that already,'' he said speaking in East Berlin
recently. ``Lots of West German companies put out various goods at
rather high prices, but people still buy it. There is a lot of
money around.''
   He said average East German savings accounts range from the
equivalents of $3,010 to $6,020.
   Last week, Trabant workers staged a brief strike in the nearby
city of Zwickau to demand protection from the unemployment expected
as outmoded enterprises try to compete with their inferior products.
   ``It is ironic, of course,'' Siebke said. ``East Germans will
accelerate the decline of their own industries by buying Western
products.''

<HEAD>Senators' Income Includes Honoraria, Gifts, Free Trips</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators padded their incomes by $2.7 million
last year by speaking to special-interest groups, but the practice
seems to be losing some of its appeal.
   The total honoraria income for senators in 1989, reported
Wednesday in annual financial disclosures, was slightly below the
levels for the two previous years. And the lobbying group Common
Cause said that for this year, more than one-third of the Senate _
34 members, up from 19 in 1988 _ have sworn off keeping speaking
fees for their personal use.
   One member on the Common Cause list, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, has
relapsed. After declining in the past to keep honoraria, he
retained $11,284 last year, saying he was strapped for funds
because of the cost of maintaining three houses. Boschwitz,
president of a lumber company, has holdings that could be worth
more than $3.4 million. Common Cause said he has promised to resume
his old policy this year.
   As usual, the top talker was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., who raked in $108,900. Senators are not allowed to keep
more than 40 percent of their salaries in honoraria, so Dole gave
all but $35,750 to charity.
   Also big on the speaking circuit were Sens. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., who collected $90,600; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, with $92,499;
and Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., with $73,450. Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, took in $50,000.
   The House, which disclosed its finances on Tuesday, has moved to
eliminate the practice of accepting honoraria after this year.
Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said the Senate should
follow suit.
   ``It is ludicrous for the Senate to have lower ethical standards
than the House, the executive branch and the judiciary,'' he said
in a statement, calling the practice ``a totally discredited
system.''
   Otherwise, the voluminous disclosure forms highlighted how
little many senators rely on their taxpayer-paid salaries,
reflected the popularity of travel financed by special interests
and listed the quirky gifts senators receive from various groups.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, was given a dog named Gus and a pair
of long underwear. Dole got 14 neckties, among other items. And
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate's tax-writing
committee, accepted a $940 Steuben glass bowl from the
Washington-based Tax Foundation.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., received eight trips paid for by
interest groups, including four to West Palm Beach, Fla., near
where he owns a vacation condominium.
   Another frequent flier was Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., who took
nine trips on the special-interest tab. The forays included Moscow,
Israel, West Palm Beach, and Indianapolis on the weekend of the
Indianapolis 500 auto race.
   As the disclosures illustrate, the Senate remains largely a rich
men's club.
   Wisconsin freshman Democrat Herbert Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee
Bucks pro basketball team, said he grossed more than $15 million
from that source alone, pushing his 1989 income to $20 million or
more. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., reported assets that could exceed $17
million from the family food empire.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., whose family founded Ralston Purina,
disclosed holdings that could be in the $15 million range, and the
assets of Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., appeared to be worth upwards
of $8 million.
   The disclosure forms require only that assets and income be
reported in broad ranges, so it is impossible to determine net
worth with any specificity. Some senators with extensive holdings
in blind trusts, such as Hollings and Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., are required to
report only the income they receive from the trusts.
   The forms can cause problems. Sen. Dave Durenberger, D-Minn.,
who already is the subject of a Senate ethics investigation, said
Wednesday he had failed to report a short-term $484,000 loan to buy
a house and a friend's gift of lodging in previous years. He filed
amended disclosures for five years.
   His office said the 35 days of lodging had been left out by
mistake, and that the loan was overlooked by someone who didn't
understand the disclosure forms. Durenberger is under investigation
for failure to report a $100,000 book-promotion deal in the past.
   Durenberger's aides said he also will amend his 1989 form to
report his legal fees as a liability.
   Among other odds and ends reported by senators:
   _Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the senior Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee, reported income of $1,836 as his one-eighth
share of proceeds from a family corn and soybean farm in his home
state.
   _Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., got $120.80 in royalties from a
record of fiddle music he recorded several years ago.
   _Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, received $40,000 in book
royalties, including income from volumes he co-wrote with Mitchell
and with former Sen. Gary Hart, and an advance on an upcoming
mystery novel.
   _Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., probably the Senate's best golfer, got a
set of clubs worth $1,870 from Ely Callaway of Carlsbad, Calif.

<HEAD>College Presidents Offer Advice on Dealing With Campus Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Listen'' is one of the suggestions Kenneth
A. Shaw, president of the University of Wisconsin System, offers to
fellow college administrators trying to deal with campus racism.
   Shaw's comment is included in a new book on dealing with a
problem that many contend is becoming more visible at U.S. colleges
and universities. The book, ``The Lurking Evil: Racial and Ethnic
Conflict on the College Campus,'' was unveiled by the American
Association of State Colleges and Universities during a news
conference Wednesday.
   ``It is clear that this is an issue that is rearing its ugly
head in a lot of ... segments of society,'' said Anthony F. Ceddia,
president of Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania and a
contributor to the book.
   The publication contains 16 articles _ most of them written by
college administrators _ that describe problems with campus racism
and offer suggestions for dealing with them.
   ``Listen. Listening gives us information about what is important
to other parties. It allows adversaries to relax and focus on
solutions,'' Shaw wrote in the book.
   Another writer, Washington lawyer David S. Tatel, suggests that
administrators use the means most available to them to fight racial
intolerance on their campuses.
   ``Universities should respond by doing wht they do best; namely
education,'' he said.
   The schools should avoid implementing written policies that
punish students for racial slurs and other verbal acts, Tatel said,
because they could wind up in court defending the rules.
   Lower federal court rulings, he said, ``have said even racial
slurs are protected speech.'' The Supreme Court has yet to rule on
the issue.
   Schools that believe policies are absolutely necessary should
draft them as narrowly and as clearly as possible, Tatel said.
   In addition, he said, ``universities ought not to write these
policies from the administration building.'' He said students,
faculty and community representatives should be involved to
minimize the chances of a court challenge and to ``demonstrate to
the courts a deliberate and careful response of the entire
community.''
   One way to change student attitudes is by making sure that all
groups are represented among the faculty and administration, said
Ceddia. He added, however, that he would ``be very cautious about
using words like portions or quotas or goals.''
   Ceddia said schools can do many things to help students learn to
deal with those of other races, but he warned, ``You can't just
accomplish reteaching in a two- or three-day or week-long program.
Programs need to be ongoing throughout the year.''

<TEXT>
   The long and apparently fruitless
haggling to bring Oakland's beloved Raiders home from Los Angeles
may cost Mayor Lionel Wilson his bid for a fourth term.
   The city of about 350,000 people has some of the highest crime
and unemployment rates in the state, a deeply troubled school
system, widespread drug abuse, budget problems and earthquake
damage.
   But those woes have been overshadowed in the campaign leading to
Tuesday's mayoral election by questions about Wilson's handling of
the Raiders deal.
   The 75-year-old Wilson, mayor since 1977, had only 18 percent of
the vote in a May 22 poll in The Tribune of Oakland. Leading was
state Assemblyman Elihu Harris, with 32 percent, followed by City
Councilman Wilson Riles Jr., with 22 percent.
   If none of the eight candidates wins more than 50 percent in the
non-partisan election, the two top vote-getters will face off in
November.
   The deal had seemed like a political bonanza when Wilson
announced in March he was bringing back the NFL team that left in
1982. The city offered Raiders owner Al Davis a $602 million
package, including guaranteed ticket income and up-front payments.
   But Wilson and the City Council had to quash the deal after
critics charged that the city, already strapped with huge expenses
and with debts from the earthquake, would end up paying millions if
Raider games didn't sell out.
   City officials have returned to the bargaining table, but their
offer has dwindled to $475 million, and it appears unlikely to be
accepted.
   Wilson's critics say his handling of the deal shows he has lost
his common touch.
   ``It exemplified people's feeling that they are not in control
of their government,'' said Harris, who was endorsed Wednesday by
The Tribune. ``The city is not accountable to the community.''
   ``People are concerned about the kind of time and energy and
resources that our elected officials have spent trying to
consummate this deal when we have such other problems,'' said Dezie
Woods-Jones, a candidate who trails far behind the leaders.
   Wilson did not return repeated phone calls. But aide Erica
Huggins said the Raiders are not a priority in his campaign.
   Riles, an 11-year City Councilman who finished second in the
1985 mayoral race and has been one of Wilson's staunchest opponents
on the Raiders deal, said Wilson's handling of the Raiders was an
example of his ``bumbling, hands-off method of administration.''
   The mayor's inattention is at the root of the blight in many of
Oakland's neighborhoods, Riles charged.
   Don Perata, president of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors
and chief architect of the Raiders proposal, said the Raiders deal
had given Riles an issue ``to move out on.''
   ``Take the Raiders issue out, there wouldn't be a clear issue in
the campaign itself,'' he said.
   The other candidates are Leo Bazile Jr., a lawyer and seven-year
City Councilman; Hector Reyna, who runs a recycling business;
Philip Haymon, a teacher and computer programmer, and Michael
Kinane, owner of a trading and consulting firm.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has grounded its fleet of twin-rotor
H-46 Sea Knight transport helicopters for the second time this
month.
   The 340 helicopters were ordered not to fly after routine
maintenance found fractures in the rotor-hub connecting links that
hold the rotor blades to their hub, said a Pentagon statement
released Wednesday.
   There are 259 helicopters in the fleet assigned to the Marine
Corps and 81 to the Navy.
   ``Aircraft will be returned to flight status following
electronic inspections of the connecting links,'' the statement
said. ``Periodic follow-up inspections will be implemented to
identify and remove from service any links which show evidence of
developing cracks.''
   The problem with the links is not related to trouble in the
copter's aft transmission that led to a May 13 grounding order, the
statement said.
   That transmission problem was discovered after an investigation
of an H-46 accident earlier this month.
   Seventeen Marines were injured at the Marine Air-Ground training
center at Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., when their helicopter made a
rough landing during an air-assault exercise.
   The transmission problem meant that the aircraft's rear rotor
system could lose its drive power.
   The helicopters were to be returned to service after the May 13
grounding and repair.

<HEAD>FEC Settles Case Against 1984 Reagan-Bush Campaign for $2,500</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission has accepted a
$2,500 fine to settle a complaint charging the 1984 Reagan-Bush
campaign with violating campaign finance laws, according to
documents.
   The campaign agreed to pay the fine as part of a conciliation
agreement that quells FEC allegations that the campaign failed to
keep records to justify voter-registration and recruitment efforts
paid for in part with public money.
   The FEC raised questions about the expenditures during its
routine audit of the campaign and asked for records detailing the
voter identification and mobilization efforts.
   The campaign committee balked at the request, saying many of the
documents requested by the commission didn't exist. In March 1987,
the commission referred the audit to its legal staff for further
action.
   ``The overall result of the committee's failure to produce these
documents has been that no final audit determination could be made
regarding the appropriateness'' of the spending, the FEC's general
counsel said in a memo included in the documents made public
Wednesday.
   The Reagan-Bush campaign signed the conciliation agreement last
month. The FEC released the records Wednesday in keeping with its
practice of making previously confidential investigations public
within 30 days after the case is closed.

<HEAD>Postal Service Says Some Doonesbury Stamps Appearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service says ``Doonesbury'' stamps
protesting the upcoming postage stamp price increase are starting
to appear in the mail.
   Cartoonist Garry Trudeau included a sheet of mock stamps,
featuring Zonker Harris of the Doonesbury comic strip, in Sunday
papers May 20.
   The stamps carry the legend ``Mad as Heck'' and ``Ticked Off''
and show a value of minus-5, which the comic strip indicates is
minus-5 cents. The stamps were intended to protest the coming
increase in postal rates from 25 cents to 30 cents.
   Postal Service spokesman Lou Eberhardt said an empty envelope
from California bearing two of the stamps arrived at Postmaster
Anthony Frank's office and that a few others have also been
delivered.
   But Eberhardt said he did not know how many of the stamps were
used.
   He said many envelopes with the stamps may have ended up in dead
letter offices, although some may have gotten through because of
the large volume of mail.
   Eberhardt said Frank finds Trudeau's work funny and takes the
stamps in the manner in which they were intended _ as a protest.
   Eberhardt said letter-writers should have no problem if they put
the cartoon stamps in addition to valid 25-cent stamps on their
mail, but Doonesbury stamps alone are not legal postage.

<HEAD>New York GOP Chooses Political Neophyte to Face Cuomo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After searching nearly a year for a
candidate, New York Republicans nominated Pierre Rinfret, a
political unknown with deep pockets, to challenge Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The 66-year-old millionaire economist said after his nomination
at the state GOP convention Wednesday that he's no sacrificial lamb.
   ``I think we're going to take this guy,'' Rinfret told the
convention.
   Cuomo is expected to announce a bid for for a third, four-year
term within days. Considered a potential 1992 Democratic
presidential contender, he is generally viewed as a big favorite
for re-election, even by Republicans.
   In trying to find a candidate to challenge him, the state GOP
had been turned down by one big-name Republican after another,
including U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. It was only last week that
party leaders settled on Rinfret.
   Rinfret, who has never run for public office, admitted he
doesn't know much about such major issues as closing the Shoreham
nuclear plant on Long Island and development in the 6 million-acre,
public-private Adirondack Park.
   But, he promised, ``I will know more than Mario Cuomo come
Election Day.''
   Born in Montreal and raised in New York City, Rinfret heads an
international economic, financial and political intelligence and
trading firm.
   He put his net worth at about $14 million but wouldn't say how
much of that he was willing to spend to try to unseat Cuomo. The
Democrat has more than $7 million in his warchest.
   Rinfret was an unpaid economic counsel to Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon and chief economic spokesman for Nixon's 1972
presidential campaign.
   His unorthodox economic policies included calls for tax cuts
during the Nixon years and a ban on credit cards to bring order to
the economy.
   In his acceptance speech to the convention, he had delegates
cheering as he advocated executing drug dealers to ``get the vermin
off the streets.'' Cuomo has vetoed the death penalty ever year
since he became governor in 1983.
   But Rinfret took the same position as Cuomo on abortion. ``I'm
pro-choice, period,'' he said. A few delegates jeered.
   The convention opened Tuesday with the adoption of an
abortion-rights platform plank, putting the New York GOP at odds
with the national party and President Bush.
   The state's Conservative Party, which usually agrees on a
candidate with the GOP, split with the Republicans over abortion.
This weekend, the Conservatives plan to nominate 51-year-old New
York University professor Herbert London.
   The split is expected to divide the anti-Cuomo vote and make the
governor's re-election even more likely.
   Cuomo has presided over two consecutive years of $1 billion-plus
tax increases, made necessary by budget deficits and economic
problems in New York.

   In October 1957, a beeping sphere streaked across
the sky, striking terror in the hearts of unsuspecting Americans.
Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite, had been launched by the
Russians.
   For the next decade, American schoolchildren were inundated with
lessons on the space program, all intimating that if the United
States lost the space race, and the Soviets landed first on the
moon, the free world was doomed.
   Today those children can bring their children to see and touch
the technology that once seemed so terrifying _ a full-size replica
of Sputnik hangs in an exhibit opening Friday at Boston's Museum of
Science.
   ``Soviet Space'' is the first major U.S. exhibit of Soviet space
technology. It tears down yet another wall between East and West.
   The exhibit represents ``a new age in space,'' said Dana Wilson,
the museum official who helped organize the show. ``The new space
age is cooperative.''
   Visitors through Sept. 23 can see working models of probes sent
to Mars and Venus, a Soyuz space capsule, Soviet spacesuits, a
returned moon probe, even Soviet space food. There's a fetching
portrait of Laika, the first dog in space.
   Cosmonauts Valentin Lebedev and Aleksei Leonov, the first man to
walk in space, will visit during the opening week, and artifacts
and history once shrouded in secrecy will be available for
comparison to the U.S. program.
   The exhibit brings to light Soviet failures along with
successes. Included is a full-size model of the Phobos probe to
Mars. An incorrect radio command caused Phobos I to lose contact
with Earth in 1988 about six weeks after launch. Phobos 2 orbited
Mars in 1989, gathering data for two months until it, too, was lost.
   To create the exhibit, Wilson and J. Kelly Beatty, who covers
the Soviet space program for the magazine Sky and Telescope, made
two trips to the Soviet Union. All doors were opened to them,
Wilson said, including those of a rocket factory.
   ``The feeling now is cooperation,'' Wilson said. ``No one
country can afford to have its own space program. Space belongs to
all of us. You hear that over and over.''
   Despite the alarm caused by Sputnik and by cosmonaut Yuri
Gagarin's becoming the first human in space in 1961, the
superpowers have long collaborated on space, including the
Soyuz-Apollo mission of 1975.
   Today, Soviet and American scientists are cooperating on
unmanned travel to Mars and hope some day to send a manned mission
to the planet.
   Although Americans ``won'' the race to the moon, the Soviets
have racked up a long list of firsts, including the first human in
space, the first spacewalk and the first woman in space (Valentina
Vladinirovna, 1963), Beatty noted.
   Most impressive is their work in conditioning cosmonauts to long
space stints, something necessary for flights to Mars or other
planets, Beatty said.
   On Dec. 21, 1988, Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov returned to
Earth exactly one year after they were launched into space. The
mission provided scientists with extensive data on the effects of
prolonged weightlessness.

<TEXT>
   A 67-year-old layman with little
experience in national church affairs gave assurances he's no
renegade after his longshot election as leader of the 2.9
million-member Presbyterian church
   Price H. Gwynn III of Charlotte, N.C., was named moderator of
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) on Wednesday at the faith's 202nd
General Assembly.
   Gwynn is the son of a Presbyterian minister but hasn't held a
national church position since 1961, when he was a commissioner to
that year's General Assembly.
   He was elected on the second ballot on 322 votes, or nearly 53
percent, from the 605 commissioners who voted. He succeeds the Rev.
Joan SalmonCampbell and will serve for a year. The last time the
church elected a lay moderator was 1987.
   Gwynn claimed a darkhorse victory over five other candidates,
all deeply involved in national and international church dealings.
   Afterward, he said: ``I'm not a renegade. But I am open to
innovation.''
   Gwynn roused the assembly with a speech critical of bureaucracy
but hopeful that faltering membership and divisiveness can be
solved through faith.
   The church has lost more than 120,000 members in the past three
years and 30 percent of its membership since 1970.
   On two major issues the assembly probably will take up next week
_ abortion and allowing homosexuals into the ministry _ Gwynn said
he would support the church's current positions. The convention
runs through June 6.
   He said he sees homosexuals as sinners deserving of God's love
but not of ordination. Abortion, he said, must be a last resort
arrived at only after much counseling and prayer. ``I'm for
responsible choice,'' he said.
   A semiretired president of a Charlotte packing company, Gwynn is
chairman of Presbyterian Hospital and Presbyterian Health Services
Corp.
   He is the eighth Presbyterian moderator since church factions
reunited in 1983, healing a Civil War-era split over slavery.

   The dollar closed sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Thursday, and the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange edged up.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 204.54 points, or 0.62
percent, closing at 33,130.80.
   The dollar closed at 151.75 yen, up 1.00 yen from Wednesday's
150.75-yen finish. The currency opened at 151.65 yen and ranged
between 151.53 yen and 152.15 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's rise followed its overnight gains on
overseas markets.
   Market players bought the dollar amid uncertainty over Soviet
politics, dealers said. Dealers cited the election of Boris
Yeltsin, a frequent critic of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, as Russian president.
   Dollar-buying interest by Japanese institutional investors
remained strong, said a trader with a commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the market is also watching the Washington summit
between President Bush and Gorbachev.
   On the stock exchange, Hideyuki Matsuda, a trader with Nippon
Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co., attributed the index's small losses
in early trading to the yen's weakness against the dollar.
   ``However, because market players feel strongly that trading has
been influenced too much by the currency market movements, they
started buying issues that have little to do with foreign exchange,
and that's when the index started recovering,'' he said.

<HEAD>Minor Parties Lose Overall, But Express Satisfaction Anyway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of minor parties say they're
satisfied with their isolated victories in local elections, even
though unofficial results showed overwhelming support for
Solidarity nationwide.
   Candidates from Solidarity-backed Citizen's Committees had a
commanding lead in Sunday's elections for local councils, partial
returns showed.
   Solidarity made an especially strong showing in large cities,
where the Citizen's Committees are better organized than in the
countryside.
   It won 59 of 60 seats in the Baltic port of Gdansk, where the
union was founded a decade ago, 72 of 75 seats in the city of
Krakow and 301 of 345 in Warsaw, according to unofficial returns
published Wednesday in the Gazeta Wyborcza daily.
   Official results for the 52,000 individual races in more than
2,000 councils were delayed because of slow reporting from some
outlying areas.
   Among the 80 other parties and groups that fielded candidates
were the Social Democrats, the party formed in January as main
successor to the now-dissolved Communist Party, various peasants
parties and the anti-Communist Confederation for an Independent
Poland.
   The Social Democrats appeared to have scored only marginal
success. The party won two seats in the cities of Kielce and
Czestochowa, six in Lodz and 15 in Warsaw.
   The small Confederation for an Independent Poland, a staunch
anti-Communist group that has been politically active for a decade,
won six seats in the city of Lublin, one in Katowice and three in
Krakow. But Leszek Moczulski, the leader of the group, lost his
race in Warsaw.
   Solidarity's landslide victory last June in races for all but
one of the parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest broke the
Communist Party's monopoly on power and led to the formation of the
first non-communist government in the East bloc three months later.
   The aim of the latest elections was to establish independent
local councils. During four decades of Communist rule, the local
councils were dependent financially and politically on central
authorities.
   Turnout in what amounted to the country's first fully free
elections since World War II was only 42 percent, with a large
number of parties as well as splits in Solidarity cited as reasons
for ignoring the polls.

   The New-York Historical Society hopes to unravel
a centuries-old art enigma: who WAS that guy in the blue dress?
   Since 1952, the society has proudly displayed a portrait said to
be of Viscount Cornbury, royal governor of the colonies of New York
and New Jersey from 1702 to 1708.
   Reflecting Lord Cornbury's reputed preference for women's
clothing, the subject of the portrait is decked out in a
jewel-adorned dress and a lace head covering.
   Patricia U. Bonomi, New York University history professor, used
to accept historical depictions of Lord Cornbury as a cross-dresser.
   But recently, while writing Cornbury's biography, she concluded
that the anonymous, undated portrait is not of him. She also
believes his political opponents launched a 200-year-old legend by
lying about his alleged proclivities.
   Philip Davenport-Hines, a fellow of the Royal Historical Society
in England, pronounced Bonomi's findings inconclusive. He said he
still thinks the portrait accurately depicts Cornbury.
   This summer, a graduate student from Columbia University will
research the painting for the New-York Historical Society, said
Annette Blaugrund, senior curator. The society also hopes to
consult Bonomi.
   ``I think there were questions all the way down the line about
the history of the painting,'' said Blaugrund.
   The historical society bought it from a British family named
Pakington, which kept the work on its estate.
   It's not clear when it was painted. But Bonomi determined the
work was first alleged in 1796 to depict Lord Cornbury, who died in
1723 after inheriting the higher title of Earl of Clarendon.
   ``I believe it was done as a serious portrait; it was not meant
to be kinky,'' said Blaugrund. ``When you look at it, there's
nothing very sexy about this picture.''
   A label that was on the frame when it arrived at the society's
museum identifies the subject as ``Lord Cornbury, half-witted son
of Henry, Lord of Clarendon.''
   The viscount was said to receive colonists ``dressed up in
complete female court costume because truly, he represented the
person of a female sovereign, his cousin, German Queen Anne,''
according to the label.
   The portrait and label remain prominently displayed in the
museum in New York City.
   How do visitors react? ``Some of them stop and giggle. A lot of
them just pass it by as being one of our large group of colonial
paintings,'' said Blaugrund.
   After all, ``a lot of these paintings have both women and men
seemingly with 5 o'clock shadows. That's a matter of painting
technique, the undercoats coming through, what time does to a
certain painting,'' she said. ``And there were some pretty hefty
women in their day.''
   Blaugrund said that in the case of this painting, ``It's pretty
clearly a man. ... He has a man's facial features: a bigger nose,
more jowly.''

<HEAD>Chinese Conduct First Nuclear Test Since 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has detonated a nuclear device
with at least twice the destructive force of the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima, its first nuclear weapons test in nearly two years,
Swedish monitors reported.
   Seismic signals indicated the explosion occurred at the Lop Nor
test site in the far western province of Xinjiang, Nils-Olov
Bergqvist of the Swedish Defense Research Establishment at the
Hagfors Observatory said Wednesday.
   The last Chinese test was Sept. 29, 1988, when Beijing tested a
low magnitude bomb of less than 10 kilotons, Bergqvist said by
telephone.
   The seismic indicators detected Saturday registered 5.8 on the
Richter scale and indicated a bomb with a yield of 40 to 50
kilotons, according to the government-run observatory.
   One kiloton has the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. The
bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan during World War II had an
explosive force of 20 kilotons.
   The Chinese have conducted only four tests since 1984,
apparently restrained by the high cost of building and exploding a
nuclear bomb.
   China, which set off its first atmospheric explosion in 1964, is
the only nuclear nation that makes no announcements about its
tests. Little is known about its nuclear capabilities.
   It was only the second test this year of a nuclear weapon,
following an explosion at the U.S. test site in Nevada on March 10.
Last year, 27 tests were carried out around the world, including 11
by the United States and seven by the Soviet Union.
   China insists that its nuclear weapons are solely for
self-defense and will never be used to strike first. Its nuclear
arsenal is believed to include a half-dozen intercontinental
ballistic missiles and more than 100 medium-range ballistic
missiles.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, newly elected president of the
Russian republic, earned his reputation as a radical reformer by
criticizing the slow pace of reform under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Following are some of the points on which they differ:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev: believes the Soviet Union was right to choose ``the
Socialist road'' 72 years ago and that perestroika should merely
breathe new life into socialism.
   Yeltsin: backed private ownership in his campaign speech and
never mentioned socialism, prompting Gorbachev to brand him
anti-socialist.
   
   Gorbachev: refuses to redraw any of the Soviet Union's internal
boundaries for fear of unleashing chaos.
   Yeltsin: urges a commission to examine the internal boundaries
of the Russian Federation, which contains some two dozen autonomous
regions, with an eye to re-examining the boundaries and creating
new regions.
   
   Gorbachev: has ruled out whittling the Soviet army down to a
small professional corps.
   Yeltsin: says the army must go professional.
   
   Gorbachev: has overseen some reform in the KGB.
   Yeltsin: urges the KGB be merged with the Interior Ministry in
one investigative body.
   
   Gorbachev: has been reluctant to take out major foreign loans to
try to cure the economy.
   Yeltsin: proposes taking out foreign loans and pulling in a
percent of the government's foreign currency income to gather 20
billion rubles and direct them mainly toward buying scarce consumer
products.
   
   Gorbachev: backs government plan to raise prices and introduce a
five-year plan to shift to a partial market economy.
   Yeltsin: says government plan is based on lowering the
already-low Soviet standard of living, and the shift to a market
economy can be faster and less painful by changing property laws,
freeing enterprises and taking out foreign loans.
   
   Gorbachev: imposed a partial economic blockade on Lithuania.
   Yeltsin: says Russia should strike deals with Lithuania and
other regions that want to sign direct contracts with Lithuania
without going through Moscow.
   
   Gorbachev: backs the government plan of a maximum tax of 55
percent on profits.
   Yeltsin: says the maximum should be 35 percent.

<HEAD>Abul Abbas Notorious For Achille Lauro Hijacking</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abul Abbas, who claimed responsibility
for the latest Palestinian guerrilla attack on the Israeli
coastline, also masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Achille
Lauro Italian cruise liner.
   The stocky Abul Abbas heads a faction called the Palestine
Liberation Front that has launched guerrilla attacks for 14 years.
His group is loyal to Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat.
   Abbas is a longtime supporter of the armed struggle to establish
a Palestinian state. His faction is said to number no more than a
few hundred.
   Abbas' guerrillas shot to death wheelchair-bound American Leon
Klinghoffer, 69, during the 52-hour Achille Lauro hijack that began
Oct. 7, 1985. They tossed his body overboard.
   Abul Abbas, the nom de guerre of Mohammed Abbas, said the
guerrillas had intended to travel to Israel aboard the liner and
launch terrorist attacks there, but the plan was scrapped when
their weapons were discovered.
   After the passengers were released, the U.S. Justice Department
issued an arrest warrant for Abbas, charging him with piracy,
hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit both crimes.
   U.S. warplanes diverted an Egyptian plane carrying Abbas to
Sicily, but Italian authorities allowed Abbas to leave for
Yugoslavia before the warrant could be served.
   Abbas, now 42, was one of three Palestinians tried in absentia
in Genoa in 1986 for the Achille Lauro crime. He was convicted and
sentenced to life in prison, while the others received lesser
prison terms.
   After he was convicted, the United States withdrew its arrest
warrant, saying that since Abbas had been tried in an Italian
court, a U.S. conviction was not important.
   In 1981, his group launched the first air infiltration attempts
from south Lebanon into Israel. A Front guerrilla flew a motorized
hang glider into northern Israel in a failed attempt to bomb an oil
refinery.
   Later that year, another Front squad flew a hot-air balloon into
Israel but Israelis said troops spotted the aircraft and shot it
down.
   Since then, there have been recurrent clashes between the
group's fighters and Israeli troops, both inside Israel's so-called
``security zone'' in south Lebanon and northern Israel.

<HEAD>Letter Claims Responsibility for Oakland Earth First! Blast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A newspaper has received a letter from
a writer identified only as ``the Lord's avenger'' claiming
responsibility for a pipe-bomb explosion that injured two radical
environmentalists in Oakland.
   The letter includes specific details about the construction and
placement of the bomb that injured Earth First! leaders Judi Bari
and Darryl Cherney, The Press Democrat reported today. The bomb
blew up in Bari's car May 24.
   Police have accused Bari and Cherney of knowingly carrying the
bomb. They have denied it.
   The writer also claimed responsibility for a bomb that went off
outside a lumber mill in Cloverdale on May 9, the newspaper said.
   The letter contained accurate details matching never-disclosed
information about the Cloverdale bomb, Larry Sheets, a bomb expert
with the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department, told the newspaper.
Nobody was injured in that blast.
   The newspaper turned the letter over to the FBI and said it had
agreed to the bureau's request not to divulge previously unreleased
details on the bombs.
   ``You've obviously got a piece of evidence that we're interested
in,'' said John Rikes, leader of the FBI's team of investigators.
``We would like to have it analyzed, along with all the other
evidence.''
   Rikes cautioned, however, that details about the bombs ``could
be taken straight out of `The Anarchist's Cookbook,''' which tells
how to make explosives out of household items.
   The three-page, single-spaced typed message was mailed to a
Press Democrat office in Ukiah.
   ``I built with these Hands the bomb that I placed in the car of
Judi Bari,'' the letter begins.
   The author claims to have been driven by religious zeal and
anger at Bari's opposition to anti-abortion protesters and to
timber cutting.
   ``I am the Lord's avenger,'' the anonymous writer said. The
letter was sprinkled with quotes from the Bible.
   The letter bore no return address and was postmarked Tuesday at
a post office in Petaluma that handles all letters mailed in a
200-mile-long area north of San Francisco, a Postal Service
spokesman said.
   Oakland police arrested Bari and Cherney for investigation of
possession of explosives. But prosecutors on Tuesday postponed
filing charges, saying they wanted to review the evidence.
   Cherney was freed on $100,000 bail. Bari remains hospitalized
under police guard.
   Bari is a leader in the Redwood Summer, a planned series of
demonstrations aimed at slowing the pace of logging.

   Frightened residents of this jungle town
spent their second night in the streets after earthquake-prone
Peru's deadliest temblor in two decades killed at least 115 people
and injured hundreds more.
   Hundreds of people crowded into Rioja's central plaza, afraid to
enter their damaged homes. Many lay inside tents or beneath
umbrellas while others crowded around smoky cooking fires in the
jungle twilight.
   More than 800 people were injured and at least 40 missing after
the earthquake, which registered 6.2 on the Richter scale, rocked
northern Peru late Tuesday night, civil defense authorities said.
   The damage was centered around Moyobamba, a farming center of
50,000 and the capital of San Martin department, 400 miles north of
Lima, officials said. Rioja is 15 miles west of Moyobamba.
   Most of the confirmed deaths occurred in Soritor, a small town
six miles south of Moyobamba that was nearly flattened by the quake.
   At least 23 people were killed in the town, including a family
of 15 living in a two-story house that collapsed. The other dead
were from nearby villages such as Rioja, a colonial town where
eight people were killed.
   ``It was very ugly,'' said Flor de Maria Masaboya of Rioja,
holding her year-old son in her arms. ``We were almost knocked off
our feet by the shaking.''
   ``All of us slept in the streets, but we were afraid to take out
our beds because we might be trapped by another tremor,'' said
Masaboya, pointing to a three-inch-wide crack in her adobe-walled
home.
   Another resident of Rioja, Juan Soplin Ruiz, said ``all the
homes are cracked and everyone fears the walls may collapse.''
   Soplin said the town has received no emergency aid from the
government. Some residents were going hungry rather than enter
their damaged homes, he said.
   Many people had begun to return to their red-tile-roofed houses
Wednesday morning, Soplin said. A strong aftershock at midday,
however, sent them fleeing back into the streets, he said.
   According to the Peruvian Geophysical Institute, the aftershock,
one of 45 during the day, registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   The main quake occurred at 9:33 p.m. Tuesday and lasted 45
seconds. It was centered in the jungle 75 miles northeast of
Moyobamba, the Geophysical Institute said.
   Authorities declared a state of emergency in battered San Martin
province, which had almost no communications with the rest of Peru.
The area also had no water or electricity.
   Local police reports reaching Lima by radio Wednesday said
several villages around Moyobamba were 60 to 80 percent destroyed.
   Gen. Jorge Ferreyro, Peru's civil defense chief, said the area
had few doctors and authorities there were asking the government to
send doctors, medicines and generators.
   Health Minister Paul Caro Gamarra said an air force plane left
for Moyobamba Wednesday afternoon carrying a team of 10 doctors and
emergency supplies. Two more planes filled with rescue supplies
were to leave today.
   Health department workers have been on a nationwide strike for
two months, but a union official in Lima said Wednesday that
workers were helping with emergency plans.
   Patricia Vargas Llosa, the wife of presidential candidate Mario
Vargas Llosa, visited the area on Wednesday, accompanied by former
President Fernando Belaunde Terry.
   ``The people there are terrorized because the ground is still
shaking,'' said Mrs. Vargas Llosa on her return to Lima. She said
many people were being treated in tent hospitals for fractures and
other injuries.
   Belaunde Terry said the worst damage appeared to be in Soritor
and the nearby town of Porvenir.
   The temblor came two days before the 20th anniversary of a
devastating earthquake that killed 70,000 people in the northern
Andes Mountains.
   That quake, the most deadly natural disaster ever recorded in
the Western Hemisphere, registered 7.7 on the Richter scale. An
estimated 20,000 people in the city of Yungay were killed that day,
buried in mud and ice that came crashing down from a nearby
mountain.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable
damage.

<HEAD>Researchers Improve Method for Finding Ages of Fossils</HEAD>

   Scientists said today they have made a
breakthrough that will let them accurately estimate the ages of
fossils up to 30,000 years old, compared with the old limit of
about 9,000 years.
   The gain in the technique known as radiocarbon dating has
already paid off by corroborating a theory on how variations in
Earth's orbit affected ancient glaciers, and it could help research
into climate and other topics, scientists said.
   The new work can correct the technique's tendency to
underestimate ages by up to 3,500 years, researchers from Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades,
N.Y., wrote in the British journal Nature.
   Scientists have long sought ways to make radiocarbon dating
accurate for older objects, and the new work seems to have
succeeded, said Harry Gove of the University of Rochester,
co-inventor of one radiocarbon dating technique.
   Another expert, Paul Damon of the University of Arizona, said,
``My guess is it will have a significant effect on the (estimated)
timing of past events'' in such areas as long-term variations in
climate.
   But Eric Delson, an anthropology professor at Lehman College of
the City University of New York, said he doubted the development
would make much difference in studies of human history. It would
simply adjust dates of many events in the same direction without
affecting the more important issue of the order in which they
occurred, he said.
   The 30,000-year time period covered by the study included the
spread of humans to the New World and cave painting in Europe, he
said.
   Radiocarbon dating is based on the fact that all living things
absorb a type of carbon called carbon-14. At death, the absorption
stops, and the amount trapped within the living thing begins to
decay at a constant rate.
   Scientists can date an object by comparing the amount of
carbon-14 in it today to the amount it had presumably absorbed from
the atmosphere while it was alive.
   The problem is that concentrations of carbon-14 in the
atmosphere vary unpredictably over time.
   Scientists have solved the problem for objects younger than
about 9,000 years, using calculations based on ancient tree rings
of known ages. But no reliable tree ring data is available for
objects older than that.
   In the new work, the researchers dated coral samples with both
carbon-14 dating and a second method, which depends on the constant
radioactive transformation of uranium-234 into thorium-230. The
second method, like the tree rings, provided an independent measure
for calibrating the carbon-14 data.
   The work was done by researchers Edouard Bard, Bruno Hamelin,
Richard Fairbanks and Alan Zindler.
   In a telephone interview, Zindler said the newfound accuracy
cleared up an inconsistency in a climate theory.
   Scientists had theorized that subtle changes in Earth's orbit
affected growth and melting of glaciers by changing the amount of
solar energy reaching the surface, he said. But previous carbon-14
dating of ancient coral clashed with that theory by suggesting the
last peak of glaciation was about 18,000 years ago, he said.
   The corrected date from the new study was 21,500 years ago,
which ``fits with that theory very well,'' Zindler said.

<HEAD>Six Gang Members Charged With Assault and Battery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Japanese gang members who were seen on a
television variety show severely beating a loan debtor have been
charged with assault and battery, officials said today.
   The six are accused of beating a 41-year-old real estate agent
at their office in Tokyo on Feb. 7 because he didn't pay back
$397,000. The man received an injury that required a one-month
treatment, police said.
   Part of the scene was broadcast on a variety program of the
Tokyo Broadcasting System Inc. on March 20. The tape was shot by a
production company under a contract with TBS.
   The assault occurred ``unexpectedly'' while the television
reporters were closely covering the gang organization, according to
Kanji Mizukami, chief of the Criminal Affairs Department in the
Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
   ``There was no conspiracy or incitement on the side of the
defendants and program producers,'' Mizukami told Japanese
reporters, according to an official in the prosecutors office.
   After the incident, police launched an investigation and
arrested the gang members. On May 16 they confiscated 29 original
videotapes containing the beating scene.
   The six men charged Wednesday include Katsuhiko Miyata, 42,
leader of Enomoto-gumi, an affiliate of the Kyokuto Sekiguchi-ikka,
an organized crime group based in Tokyo.
   The gang is believed to have hundreds of members, police say.

   Four of New York's Mafia families used their
combined muscle to assume near-total control over installation of
windows in city housing projects, prosecutors alleged in announcing
the indictment of 15 people.
   Among those charged were the reputed bosses of the Genovese and
Lucchese crime families.
   ``Today's indictment closes the cash window on this lucrative
enterprise,'' U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   Since 1978, more than 75 percent of the window contracts awarded
by the city's Housing Authority, totaling more than $191 million,
went to companies controlled by the criminal enterprise, Thornburgh
said.
   Payments of up to $2 per window for about 1 million windows were
funneled to the Lucchese family, prosecutors said.
   The scheme made even higher profits by illegally using non-union
labor and by employing intimidation and threats of labor unrest to
keep legitimate contractors from making lower bids on the window
contracts, prosecutors said.
   The scam cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory O'Connell.
   Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said the four
normally rival crime families cooperated because of the profits to
be made.
   ``Most if not all of the companies bidding on New York City
Housing contracts were mob-owned or mob-controlled,'' Maloney said.
   The indictment charges the defendants with labor racketeering,
labor payoffs, extortion, mail fraud and conspiracy.
   If convicted, the defendants could spend the rest of their lives
in jail.
   Vincent ``the Chin'' Gigante, the 62-year-old alleged boss of
the Genovese family, and Vittorio Amuso, reputed head of the
Lucchese family, were among those indicted. Gigante was said have
mediated disputes among the families.
   Gigante, who often walks the streets in his pajamas and mumbles
to himself, denies he is a mobster and claims to be mentally ill.
On Wednesday, he refused to get dressed when agents arrested him.
He appeared in court in a hooded bathrobe.
   Also named were Benedetto Aloi, an alleged underboss in the
Colombo crime family, and Peter Gotti, brother of reputed Gambino
boss John Gotti. John Gotti, who was acquitted the last three times
he was tried, was not named.
   Gigante's lawyer, Barry Slotnick, entered an innocent plea for
him and said he was mentally incompetent and has severe heart
problems. ``Any stress could cause sudden death,'' Slotnick said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles E. Rose said prosecutors
believed Gigante's behavior is an act.
   U.S. Magistrate John L. Caden ordered Gigante held in a
psychiatric ward pending a hearing. Four other defendants were
ordered held without bail. Gotti and five others were free on $1
million bail. Three others were being sought.

<HEAD>Rebels Agree To Disarm in Accord With Gov't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Contra rebels have agreed to
disarm by June 10 after reaching accords with the government that
give them zones for settlement, their own police force and a voice
in government.
   According to the agreement signed Wednesday, some Contra
commanders could be sent to Nicaraguan embassies abroad for their
safety, a government source said.
   Top Contra leader Israel Galeano said he was ``taking
responsibility'' to complete the disarmament of his 13,000-member
force by June 10, a deadline set in an earlier accord signed May 4
with the government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Mrs. Chamorro, announcing the accord, said: ``What we want as
Nicaraguans ... is peace and reconciliation.''
   The president, who defeated the long-ruling leftist Sandinistas
in elections Feb. 25 and took office two months later, said she was
satisfied that the ``misunderstandings'' that led the U.S.-backed
Contras to suspend disarmament for a time had been overcome.
   The latest accord, which spells out the aid to be given
demobilized rebels, says former combatants will form a police force
to ensure public order within regional development centers where
they may settle.
   The government will ask the United Nations to expand the mandate
of its peacekeeping forces to include instructing the Contras in
the creation of a professional police force, which will be under
the Interior Ministry.
   ``It's like the formation of a state within a state, and it's
very dangerous, because Nicaragua could become another Lebanon,''
said Reynaldo Antonio Tefel, a Sandinista deputy in the National
Assembly.
   ``It would be forming another army disguised as a police. In
this manner, instead of distancing ourselves from war, we'd be
getting closer to it,'' Tefel added.
   Galeano, who goes by Commander Franklin, sent a commission to
Managua last week to talk about resuming the demobilization that
began May 8.
   The commission last Friday accused the army, under Sandinista
control, of slaughtering 14 demobilized fighters and 100 civilians.
They halted the disarmament, saying they had no security.
   Investigators, including representatives of the Contras,
government, and international organizations found no evidence of
the killings.
   Galeano said there would be no more suspensions of the
dismantling process. ``We are assuming the responsibility,'' he
said.
   A top government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press the government offered top Contra
commanders diplomatic posts abroad for their own security.
   ``Those who don't feel safe here can go to one of our missions
and stay away for a year or so, and come back when they feel
safe,'' the source said.
   The source said the posts offered would be as low-level
diplomats. He said the only purpose would be to afford Contra
commanders some protection and keep them out of Nicaragua.
   The Contras agreed to demobilize at least 100 rebels daily in
each of the five security zones where the guerrillas are massed.
   But if the deadline is to be met, the number of rebels disarming
would have to be at least 200 per day in each zone.
   So far, fewer than 2,000 rebels have turned in their weapons to
United Nations and Organization of American States peace missions
supervising the demobilization process.
   Galeano said the establishment of regional development centers,
where demobilized combatants can settle, was important in resuming
the disbanding.
   Both sides announced Tuesday an agreement establishing more than
20 regional development centers in rural areas.
   Under the accord, demobilized rebels, who are largely peasants,
would be given priority in recovering their farmland confiscated by
the Sandinistas.
   They also will be guaranteed representation in municipal
governments of towns within the development centers as well as in
government ministries that will have to deal with helping them
rejoin civilian life.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Tries a New Attack Against Medfly Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unable to banish malathion-spraying
helicopters from its skies, Los Angeles wants to bar them from its
airfields.
   In a unanimous vote, the 15-member City Council on Wednesday
ordered an ordinance drafted barring the helicopters from Los
Angeles airports. Choppers in past months have been spraying
malathion to kill the crop-devouring Medfly.
   The ordinance should be ready by Tuesday, said Greg Nelson,
spokesman for Councilman Joel Wachs.
   Courts thus far have rejected lawsuits from Southern California
municipalities trying to block the state-ordered spraying.
   Opponents contend not enough is known about malathion's
long-term health effects. State officials say the pesticide is safe.
   Officials sprayed Garden Grove on Wednesday, but it was to be
the last city sprayed unless new flies are found. Officials are
trying to supplant the spraying with the use of sterile flies,
which disrupt the Medfly breeding cycle.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Agriculture Department officials in Washington
on Wednesday declined a request from Florida officials to
quarantine all California produce. More than 1,300 square miles in
California already are quarantined.
   A total quarantine would have been disastrous for California's
multibillion-dollar farm industry and a boon to Florida. Nearly two
dozen of the flies, which can turn fruit to mush, have been spotted
since April 16 in Florida.

   Mikhail Gorbachev's meeting with South
Korea's president in San Francisco next week could eventually lead
to diplomatic relations between the two nations and unification of
Korea, a scholar says.
   ``I don't expect any particularly shattering development right
away, but it's a first step of great symbolic importance,''
Lawrence Lau, Stanford University professor in Asian economics,
said Wednesday.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if diplomatic relations are
established out of this.''
   The Soviet leader, who begins four days of talks today with
President Bush, will meet with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
on Monday during Gorbachev's 21-hour stay here, said U.S. officials
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Better relations between Moscow and Seoul, for more than 40
years a pro-U.S. foe of Soviet-backed North Korea, would help the
Soviets by giving them a cheap, close source of consumer goods and
a market for natural resources, Lau said.
   ``From the Soviet point of view, South Korea also is in a
position to help North Korea,'' Lau said. ``Unification is pretty
far up the road, but the North Koreans need help and their
principal supporter _ the Soviet Union _ is no longer in a position
to support them.''
   Youn Ja Shin-Chey, a leader of the Korean Center in San
Francisco and a Russian scholar, said the 100,000-strong Korean
community in the Bay Area was surprised and thrilled by the meeting.
   ``There are maybe 60 million Koreans all over the world, and if
you asked any Korean, `What is your one wish?' the answer would be,
`The unification of North and South,''' Youn said.
   Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S.
zones of occupation after World War II. North Korean forces invaded
South Korea, prompting the Korean War from 1950 to 1953; the
peninsula since has remained two independent nations.
   The nations have no formal diplomatic relations and the Soviets
maintain strong ties with North Korea.
   In December, the Soviet Union and South Korea opened consular
departments in their trade offices in each other's capitals. But
officials working there do not have normal diplomatic privileges.

   There's the glamorous side to Mikhail
Gorbachev's visit, and then there's the not-so-glamorous side: the
ropes, barrels, flatbed trucks, directional signs and portable
toilets.
   Just ask the advance team preparing for the six-hour visit to
the Twin Cities area Sunday by the Soviet president and his wife,
Raisa.
   ``There are very few portable toilets left in town,'' advance
team member Karen Gruenberg said Wednesday. ``We were trying to
track down 85 and we finally found them.''
   While politicians, business leaders and others prepare for
meetings and handshakes, the advance team prepares for those who
will watch the meetings and handshakes: the public and news media.
   The 1,000 barrels to be used as barricades are a ``hot
commodity'' because so many already are in use at construction
sites and elsewhere, said Julie Drake, another advance team member.
   Then there's the rope _ 31,000 feet of it. Consultations with
the Secret Service were required to decide what kind to buy.
   ``They said they would prefer bright yellow so it can be easily
seen and nylon for strength and (so) it won't stretch,'' Drake said.
   Oh yes, and the rope should be a half-inch thick, she said.
   Then there was the flag snag. Ever try to get a 4-by-6-foot
Soviet flag on short notice?
   ``We needed only about eight and yesterday there were 11 left
around the country you could buy,'' Gruenberg said. ``They were all
gone this morning.''
   Among other items needed: About 120 media platforms, 100 two-way
radios, 2,000 welcome and directional signs in Russian and English,
4,000 box lunches for media and staff people at the Metrodome media
center, and 16 flatbed trucks for reporters and photographers.

   Four children were found fatally
stabbed in their beds and their mother was in critical condition
with a stab wound that may have been self-inflicted, police said.
   The children, all under 12, had been stabbed in the neck, Police
Chief Carl Verrastro said, as was their mother, 36-year-old Maria
Isabella Amaya, a native of El Salvador.
   She had been under psychiatric care for about eight months,
Verrastro said.
   The youngsters' father, Halley William Amaya, 33, came to a
neighbor Wednesday and asked her to call a doctor to the home, said
the neighbor, Andrea Orphanos.
   ```She killed the little ones and tried to kill herself,'''
Orphanos quoted Amaya as telling her.
   Verrastro said an arrest was expected today. He stressed that
other people were not at risk.
   ``I don't want the community's imagination to run wild that a
Jack the Ripper is at large,'' he said.
   Police found the bodies of the children _ Halley Jr., 11,
Jessica, 8, Christopher, 6, and Edward, 3{ _ on beds throughout the
house.
   They had been dead ``for some time,'' said Verrastro.
   Mrs. Amaya was found alive on another bed and rushed to the
hospital.
   The Amayas and their oldest child came eight years ago from El
Salvador to the United States, where the other three children were
born, Verrastro said.
   Orphanos said they were ``very nice people, hard-working
people.''
   Port Chester, a village of about 25,000 people, is north of New
York City near the Connecticut border.

<TEXT>
   The Chinese government has executed 20 people,
including a man convicted of destroying an Air Force jeep during
last June's pro-democracy uprising, Chinese newspapers reported.
   Sunday's edition of the official Sichuan Daily, seen in Beijing
today, said courts in the capital of Sichuan province last week
sentenced nine people to die, including convicted arsonist Yu
Yongchuan. All were immediately executed.
   The newspaper said Yu led others in overturning a jeep and
setting it on fire during rioting that broke out in the capital,
Chengdu, on June 5, the day after the bloody military suppression
of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   The official press has reported the executions of at least 20
participants in anti-government disturbances last June, although
the number of actual executions is believed to be substantially
higher.
   Yu is the first reported case since a Beijing court last
December sentenced two men to die for killing a policeman on June 4.
   The official Beijing Daily also reported today that a local
court ordered the execution of 11 criminals the day before. The
court cited the need to ensure social stability for the Asian Games
to be staged in Beijing in September.
   The condemned, convicted of murder, robbery, rape and
``hooliganism,'' were immediately taken to an execution grounds and
shot to death, the daily said.
   Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court chief Ji Shuhan,
in handing down the verdict, said the city must ``severely attack
criminal elements'' to ensure the security of the Asian Games and
October 1 National Day, the Beijing Daily said.
   The Sichuan and Beijing trials followed another mass execution
in Zhengzhou, central China, on Saturday, when 11 train robbers
were put to death.
   China does not release capital punishment figures, and many
executions go unreported in the official press.
   However, recently the press has carried numerous reports of
death sentences and condemned men have been paraded before mass
rallies to emphasize the government's tough stance toward crime.
   A Shanghai court last week sentenced 10 people to die on various
murder and robbery charges. In Canton last month, 10 people were
executed for selling tainted liquor and 11 others were put to death
for robbery and murder.

   The dollar rose against key European currencies
this morning after gaining strongly against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo trading.
   Gold prices were lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.75 yen, a gain of 1.00 yen
from Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 152.05
yen.
   The dollar, which had risen on overseas markets overnight, rose
further in Tokyo as institutional investors and investment trust
companies bought the U.S. currency against the yen for technical
adjustments, said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe
Bank in Tokyo.
   ``But the dollar did not rise as high as 152.50 yen because
manufacturers started selling it just above the 152-yen line, while
life insurance companies also sold the dollar at that level for
profit-taking,'' he said.
   The dollar was also held back by concerns over the release of
the U.S. jobless rate for May, scheduled for Friday in Washington,
Tabata said.
   Approximately $12 billion changed hands in spot trading,
unchanged from Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6905 West German marks, up from 1.6810
   _1.4235 Swiss francs, up from 1.4210
   _5.7000 French francs, up from 5.6715

   _1,243.00 Italian lire, up from 1,237.25
   _1.1760 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1778
   The British pound traded in London at $1.6835 compared to
$1.6930 late Wednesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $363.75 an

   In Zurich, gold opened at a bid price was $363.85, down from
$366.25 late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $2.22 an ounce today, to close at

   Imelda Marcos says the State Department offered
to return her to the Philippines for trial if she agreed to
campaign for the renewal of U.S. military base leases, according to
a report today.
   Mrs. Marcos, on trial for allegedly looting the Philippine
treasury, said in an interview with the New York Post that U.S.
officials made the suggestion in a two-day visit over the weekend.
   ``They suggested a graceful way out of my situation was if the
Philippine congress could unanimously demand my return so that I
may stand trial back home,'' Mrs. Marcos told the Post.
   A State Department official denied the agency had contacted Mrs.
Marcos or had met with her last weekend, the Post said. The
newspaper did not name the official.
   ``We're engaged in discussions with the Philippine government
about the future security relationship. ... Mrs. Marcos is not a
part of the Philippine government,'' the official said.
   American and Philippine negotiators are preparing to resume
talks on whether to renew leases on Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations. The leases expire in September
1991.
   Opposition to the bases is growing because many Philippine
citizens view them as an infringement on national sovereignty.
   In the copyrighted article by columnist Cindy Adams, Mrs. Marcos
said, ``The American government which is prosecuting me is now
asking me for my help. ...
   ``The conditions being that, when I step from the plane,
somebody would ask, `Mrs. Marcos, are you pro-bases?' and I would
say `Yes' and immediately start campaigning,'' she said.
   ``Apparently they have no more aces. Their only ace is me.''

   While Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
samples lamb at a business luncheon, his wife, Raisa, will be
treated to the tasty treasures of Fisherman's Wharf: sourdough
bread and walkaway cocktails of shrimp, lobster and crab.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will take a whirlwind tour of the city from 3
p.m. to 4 p.m. on Monday after she and her husband return from
Stanford University and he goes on to meet with executives of 150
West Coast companies.
   Fishermen and merchants along Fisherman's Wharf are planning a
colorful and musical welcome for Mrs. Gorbachev.
   ``We'll have the most marvelous flowers for her and a sample of
our Epicurean delights _ prawns, shrimp, crab, lobster, Petrale
sole,'' said an enthusiastic Al Baccari, executive director of the
Fisherman's Wharf Association.
   Baccari plans to have a band play for Mrs. Gorbachev and boats
along the wharf hoist the Soviet flags. She'll be offered a platter
of food to nibble on during her tour and a coloring book with
crayons to take home, along with a framed etching of the wharf.
   ``It's all just to say welcome, even for a few minutes,'' said
Baccari. ``I remember with affection when another Russian leader
(Nikita S. Khrushchev) visited us and he captured theimagination of
the town. Things like this add to the international flavor of San
Francisco, the birthplace of the United Nations, and make it a
joyous city.''
   The shopkeepers are not offended at all by Gorbachev skipping
the tour and attending to business.
   ``Raisa would have more fun ... She could go shopping,'' said
Ian Bader of Ripley's Magic Shop along the wharf.
   It's not likely Mrs. Gorbachev will have time for shopping.
Among the sights listed on an itinerary released Wednesday are
Golden Gate Park, Civic Center, Davies Symphony Hall, the Bank of
America Building and Fisherman's Wharf, with possible stops at the
M.H. de Young Museum and the Opera House.
   Mrs. Gorbachev is expected to be escorted on her tour by Tatyana
Kamenev, wife of the Soviet consul general, and perhaps Sherry
Agnos, wife of Mayor Art Agnos, said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San
Francisco's chief of protocol.
   ``They won't have much time, but I think she'll like it and come
back,'' Swig said. ``I just hope they don't stop in Civic Plaza.''
   Civic Plaza, across from City Hall, has become a campground for
the homeless in recent years.
   After returning to the consul general's residence, Mrs.
Gorbachev will meet with Friends of Raisa Gorbachev, including
women who have met her on trips to the Soviet Union to promote
peace.
   ``It's people who really respect her and want to show her some
hospitality,'' said Swig, ``and think of her as being a really
strong intellectual, a caring, strong woman.''
   Patricia Montandon, founder of Children as the Peacemakers, has
traveled extensively in the Soviet Union on behalf of world peace
and has met Mrs. Gorbachev several times.
   ``I will see her here but I think it's very important for other
people in San Francisco to meet her,'' Montandon said. ``She is
very much interested in causes for women and children. She has a
mind of her own. She's a doctor of philosophy and taught at the
university in Moscow. She's not just a supporter of her husband,
she's in partnership with him.''
   The Gorbachevs are scheduled to leave at 5:30 p.m. for a
rush-hour drive across the Golden Gate Bridge to Vista Point before
returning to San Francisco International Airport for their
departure at 6:30 p.m.

   China will send an assistant foreign minister to
Hanoi next month for the highest-level official visit to Vietnam
since the two countries fought a brief war in 1979, the Foreign
Ministry said today.
   Xu Dunxin, who also heads the ministry's Department of Asian
Affairs, will travel to Bangkok in early June for consultations
with Thai leaders on the Cambodia war, and then go on to Hanoi,
said ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua.
   Xu will exchange views on Cambodia with Vietnamese officials, Li
said.
   Xu's trip to Bangkok and Hanoi will coincide with talks in Tokyo
among the warring parties of Cambodia on a possible cease-fire.
   China officially supported the Hanoi government during the
Vietnam War, but relations between the two socialist countries
turned hostile when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and drove
the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge from power.
   China launched a short border war against Vietnam in early 1979
to ``punish'' Hanoi. Since then China has been the main military
supporter of the Khmer Rouge and other resistance forces battling
the Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen government in Cambodia.
   In recent years, Vietnam has sought better relations with China
and has sent several high-level delegations to Beijing. Vietnamese
First Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem visited Beijing in
early May for talks on Cambodia.
   The Beijing government, however, insists that normalization of
relations can only take place after a political settlement is
reached in Cambodia.

   A flier has been distributed offering
a reward for the slayings of seven black leaders involved in a
local school desegregation struggle.
   Police refused to give details of the case, including where the
fliers had appeared. They said security measures were being taken
to protect those threatened.
   Listed on the fliers were School Board members Wendell Holmes
and Samuel Nesbitt; National Association for the Advance of Colored
People education chairman Fred Matthews; Jacksonville Urban League
President Ronnie Ferguson; the Rev. Rudolph McKissick; Assistant
Superintendent Alvin White and Willye Dennis, president of the
local chapter of the NAACP.
   In December, a package bomb similiar to those that killed a
federal appeals court judge and a Savannah attorney was intercepted
at Mrs. Dennis' office.
   The fliers declare the seven ``wanted dead or alive for
self-serving crimes, murdering our kids future! Shoot on sight.
$10,000 price guarantee.''
   School security officials, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office and
the FBI are investigating the messages, said schools Superintendent
Larry Zenke.
   School officials and black leaders are struggling to come up
with a school desegregation plan that complies with a federal court
order. The seven are key players in the negotiations.
   Nesbitt said he first heard of the fliers early Monday when
police showed up at his home with one.
   Ferguson said he had seen a copy and had talked to police about
his safety.
   ``We have been cautious ever since the bomb scare, and we're
going to continue to be cautious,'' he said.

   Surgeons today said they have found a way to
forestall a usually fatal birth defect by opening up the mother,
operating on the fetus and putting it back in the womb to develop
normally.
   Experts say the operation, which involves rearranging the
fetus's organs, is the most extensive fetal operation ever
successfully performed. However, it is also controversial because
of the risks to both the mother and fetus.
   The first successful operation was performed on Blake Schultz,
now 9 months old, the son of Elizabeth and Richard Schultz of
Waterloo, Mich. ``I'm just glad he's healthy. And hopefully it will
help other people too,'' Ms. Schultz said.
   The surgery was pioneered at the University of California, San
Francisco, to correct fetal diaphragmatic hernia, a defect that
occurs in about one of every 2,000 babies. About three-quarters of
all babies with the defect die.
   During development, a hole in the fetus's diaphragm fails to
grow shut, and the stomach, intestines and other organs squeeze
into the chest cavity. As a result, the lungs fail to develop, and
the baby is born unable to breath.
   ``This problem is immensely frustrating for pediatric surgeons,
because the babies are otherwise perfectly nice, but they die,''
said Dr. Michael R. Harrison, who developed the surgery. ``It
seemed as though this was one of those situations in medicine where
fixing it earlier would be the only way to have an impact.''
   Harrison has performed the highly experimental surgery eight
times. The first six fetuses died, but the last two went on to
become healthy children, Blake Schultz and a girl. A report on the
first success was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   During the surgery, doctors cut into Ms. Schultz's uterus and
pulled the fetus's arm through the hole.
   Then they put the misplaced stomach, intestines and other organs
back where they belonged and covered the hole in the diaphragm with
a Gore-Tex patch. Finally they tucked the fetus's arm back into the
womb and closed up the incision.
   Ms. Schultz carried the fetus for seven more weeks before giving
birth. The baby was premature and had to spend a month on a
respirator but is now healthy.
   The second successful operation was performed March 3 on Devona
Anderson, of Tacoma, Wash., now 6 weeks old. She did better and was
able to breathe on her own on her second day of life.
   Her father, Stephen Anderson, said he and his wife, Lora, were
devastated when they learned the fetus had only a 25 percent chance
of survival if born with the defect. ``The more we thought, the
more we thought, `Let's do it,''' he said.
   The operation takes just under an hour and costs about $16,000.
   At the University of Manitoba, Dr. Frank Manning said a major
difficulty is separating those fetuses that will survive without
surgery from those that are doomed, since the operation itself is
highly dangerous to the fetus.
   He also noted that women who undergo the surgery risk a ruptured
uterus if they get pregnant again.
   ``I don't want to pour on cold water, because this is an
innovative thing he has done,'' said Manning. ``But I can't give
you unbridled enthusiasm and tell you this will be the panacea for
diaphragmatic hernia.''
   ``The disease he is attacking is a very big problem in
pediatrics,'' said Dr. Joseph P. Vacanti of Children's Hospital in
Boston. ``It is an important approach that ought to continue to be
investigated.''
   Doctors have experimented for the past decade with treating and
repairing defective fetuses before birth. Most such operations have
been relatively minor, however. Among the most common is opening up
urinary blockages.
   Harrison said he worked on the latest procedure for about 12
years. His team tested it on 1,000 fetal lambs and 200 fetal
monkeys and reviewed 200 fetuses in which the disorder was not
treated before birth.

   President Bush is welcoming Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to the White House today for summit talks marked by hopes
for a strategic arms control agreement but sharp differences over
the shape of a united Germany in the post-Cold War era.
   As Soviet and American flags waved side-by-side along
Pennsylvania Avenue, Bush and the Soviet president headed for their
first negotiating session in four days of summitry at the White
House and Camp David, Md.
   A few hours before ritual welcoming ceremonies on the White
House South Lawn, Secretary of State James A. Baker III held out
the prospect of ``significant and concrete progress'' on arms
control at the summit, the first since Bush and Gorbachev met six
months ago at Malta.
   Baker, interviewed on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' saw
encouraging signs of a ``dialogue'' on Lithuanian independence, an
issue that has left plans for a Soviet-American trade agreement in
limbo.
   But Baker cautioned that neither Lithuania nor the German issue
is likely to be resolved at the summit.
   On his arrival from Canada late Wednesday, Gorbachev declared
that the summit ``stands out in its importance, first of all, for
the promise it holds as the first major step to reduce strategic
nuclear arms.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, like Baker, sought to
discourage speculation of major breakthroughs at the summit.
   ``I don't think it ought to be measured in terms of what gets
signed and what doesn't get signed, but how it develops the
relationship,'' Sununu said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Treaties and lesser agreements covering arms control, chemical
weapons, air travel and other subjects were in various stages of
readiness. But the list of differences ran to conventional weapons
cutbacks, trade, human rights, Gorbachev's handling of the
secessionist republic of Lithuania - and Germany.
   Whatever the diplomatic prospects, Washington was eagerly
awaiting its springtime summit.
   Oversized American and Soviet flags hung side by side over the
entrance to the federal office building next door to the White
House - Old Glory on the left and the Hammer and Sickle on the
right.
   In the elegance of the White House, waiters were setting out the
china for the state dinner on the first evening's schedule. Across
the street at Lafayette Square, authorities doled out space to
competing protest groups, and assigned undercover officers to keep
an eye on things.
   For his part, Gorbachev moved about town in a motorcade that
stretched for more than 50 vehicles.
   Even as Gorbachev arrived came a fresh reminder of his
difficulty at home. Newly elected Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin said he would press for swift sovereignty for his republic
- the largest and most influential one in the Soviet Union.

   The Soviet leader made no mention of Germany when he arrived at
Andrews Air Force Base, although he said earlier in the day in
Canada the United States and its allies were trying to `` dictate''
the terms of the merger between East Germany and West Germany.
``This will not suit us,'' he said.
   Baker referred to Germany when he welcomed the Soviet leader to
America.
   The challenge of the summit, he said, was to ``leave behind not
only the Cold War but also the conflicts that preceded it. To do
that we must see a Germany unified and Europe reconciled.''
   Soviet commentator Georgi Arbatov, also interviewed on NBC-TV,
said today that NATO represents ``an anti-Soviet military bloc''
that cannot last. ``Europe needs a totally new organization,'' he
said. ``You cannot bring Cold War structures into a post-Cold War
world.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry adviser Vitaly Churkin said on ABC-TV
that ``we're flexible'' on the German issue and that U.S. officials
were showing signs of ``creative movement.''
   The two leaders are expected to sign a declaration of basic
agreements on cuts in long range nuclear weapons, with a
long-sought treaty hopefully to follow by the end of the year. The
goal is to reduce arsenals of nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines by 30 to 35 percent.
   A formal signing ceremony was scheduled for Friday. Agreements
ranging from chemical weapons to air travel were ready for
signatures, as well.
   Talks on proposed cuts in troops and conventional weapons were
on the agenda, as well, but progress there seemed to hinge on the
outcome of what shaped up as the thorniest issue of the summit.
   The White House said Bush was sympathetic to Soviet concerns
about the military might of a reunified Germany, and added it would
pursue an answer that was ``politically acceptable and reasonable.''
   Privately, U.S. officials said Bush would cut no deal at the
summit to limit German troops, but he is prepared to discuss a
formula that might eventually scale down those forces along with
the Red Army.
   Bush has insisted that a unified Germany remain within the NATO
alliance. Gorbachev has proposed that it be a member of both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact, or that both military alliances be disbanded.
West Germany has been in NATO. East Germany has long been in the
Soviet-sponsored Warsaw Pact, but its alignment is uncertain
following the fall of the Communist government there last year.
   Before leaving Canada for Washington, Gorbachev challenged Bush
to offer another solution to the German question.
   ``It seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be
playing the same note again and again. ... I would like us to find
a new melody,'' the Soviet leader said.

   Welcome, visitor from the land of Glasnost, to
the land of Huckster. Behold, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, free
enterprise at work.
   While the news pages of the nation's newspapers are filled with
accounts of your visit, it is on the advertising pages where
brotherly feelings hold sway.
   Who can resist the message of warmth and good fellowship in the
full-page advertisement dominated by a steaming cup of coffee and
this message across the top: ``We hope this is the only thing that
comes between Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush this week.''
   If you are wise in the ways of advertising, Mikhail Sergeyevich,
you will search for the hook. There it is, at the bottom,
discreetly. ``Chock Full o'Nuts Corporation,'' it says. The firm,
Mr. President, makes coffee.
   We turn the pages to see two drink glasses, each half full, with
the American Stars and Stripes and the Soviet Hammer and Sickle
decorating the stirrers.
   ``Sometimes the best relationships start on the rocks,'' is the
message. And below, in smaller print, it continues: ``Tomorrow the
superpowers begin yet another historic summit. Stolichnaya _ the
import that broke the ice in 1972 _ hopes their discussions go as
smoothly as their toasts.''
   There are two metaphors at play here, and you have to know the
idiom to get the point. On the rocks is a mariner's term for
running his ship aground. In this case it refers to past
U.S.-Soviet difficulties.
   On the rocks has a second connotation. It refers to straight
booze over ice. The advertisement, placed by Stolichnaya, the
Russian vodka, combines the two ideas.
   That's not all that's combined. Stolichnaya is exported to this
country by PepsiCo which is allowed, in turn, to sell Pepsi Cola in
the Soviet Union.
   Let us move on to a less subtle advertising presentation, also a
full page.
   In three rows of three each, it shows battleships, helicopters,
tanks, fighter planes, submarines, missiles, trucks with missiles
and soldiers with guns at the ready. Each set of the figures is
covered with a big red X _ as if to indicate the summit had done
away with their threats.
   The ninth panel is left unscathed, as if it were all that
remains after the tools of war had been done away with. It shows
nine bottles of Smirnoff Vodka, and this legend across the bottom:
   ``Now that's what we call a successful summit.'' In smaller
type, the ad mentions that ``first, the Russians welcomed Smirnoff
back in the USSR after 73 years. Next, who knows? With a start like
that, anything is possible.''
   In case the news media missed their ad, Stolichnaya followed
with a personally delivered statement to say that five cases of
their premium product were delivered to the White House for
Friday's state dinner. There was also something about a drink
called the ``Glasnost Mary'' being served, using guess-whose vodka.
   Just because these samplings are about beverages, Mr. President,
doesn't mean that their makers are the only ones to do, shall we
say, business as usual at this propitious time.
   The Smith Corona Corporation, maker of office machines, boasts
that your delegation, Mr. President, will use Smith Corona's
personal word processor and electronic portable typewriter products
this summit week. With Cyrillic alphabet, yet.
   The firm pointed out that it is selling its products through
Vneshtorgizdat. In case you want to get one at home.

<HEAD>Appeal Says Last Man Florida Executed Was Tortured by Electric

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a condemned murderer
argue in an appeal that the last man Florida sent to the electric
chair was tortured in a botched execution that the state is not
investigating properly.
   ``An inmate about to be executed in Florida will likely be
burned and tortured during that execution, will be conscious during
the event, and will suffer pain,'' says the appeal.
   Color photographs of the bodies of 10 executed men accompanied
the motion filed Wednesday by state-paid attorneys for a prisoner
condemned to die July 10.
   Fire, smoke and sparks flew from the head of the last man
executed in Florida, on May 4.
   ``Jessie Joseph Tafero was burned alive in Florida's electric
chair,'' the appeal said. ``There is no assurance that William
Michael Squires will also not be burned alive.''
   Tafero's execution for the fatal shootings of two law
enforcement officers 14 years earlier shows that executing Squires
would be a violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel
and unusual punishment, the motion argues.
   Squires, 48, is condemned for the September 1980 fatal shooting
of service station attendant Jesse Albritton in Hillsborough
County. He is under his first warrant, and no death row inmate has
been executed on a first warrant since since the state reinstituted
capital punishment in 1979.
   Reporters and prison officials who witnessed Tafero's execution
said he appeared to breathe and move after the first and second
jolts. Gov. Bob Martinez ordered an investigation. Four days later,
the state Department of Corrections concluded Tafero's death was
instant but that the mistaken replacement of a natural sponge with
a synthetic sponge had caused the burns on his head.
   Squires' attorneys blasted the corrections department for
testing the flammability of the sponge used in Tafero's execution
by using a household toaster. ``Scientific testing is not done with
a toaster,'' the attorneys wrote.
   The attorneys, from the state agency that represents poor death
row inmates, said corrections officials are not competent to carry
out executions without unneccessary pain.
   Spokesmen for Martinez and Corrections Secretary Richard Dugger
said Wednesday that the state stood by its investigation. In a
statement, Dugger called the allegations absurd, frivolous and
``designed to distort Eighth Amendment issues with a smokescreen of
technical and procedural fault-finding.''

   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin said today he
expected to meet Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev soon and
assured concerned lawmakers that the two political rivals would
``resolve most issues'' between them.
   Yeltsin, who was elected Tuesday to the powerful post despite
the opposition of Gorbachev, said he would try to mend fences with
Gorbachev but outlined a far more radical program than that of the
Soviet president.
   As president of Russia, the largest and most powerful of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics, Yeltsin could pose a major challenge
to Gorbachev and his economic reforms.
   Yeltsin promised to seek a ``businesslike'' relationship with
Gorbachev, despite their personal differences.
   ``True, we have our differences,'' he said. ``I renounce all
these personal aspects fully and completely. I leave that behind.''
   Deputies speaking today at the Russian Congress ``expressed
concern over the exchange of statements about each other'' by
Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the
summit with President Bush in Washington, ``I think we'll have an
appropriate conversation, and we'll resolve most issues without
damaging the sovereignty and aims of Russia,'' Tass said.
   Gorbachev told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday he was ``somewhat
concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin ``is
playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time.''
There have been no reports that he sent congratulations to Yeltsin
on his election.
   Yeltsin's election as Russian president capped a remarkable
political comeback. Gorbachev brought him to Moscow to head the
city's Communist Party, but sacked him in 1987 for criticizing the
slow pace of reform.
   He returned to power through a popular election to the Russian
Congress, and survived _ perhaps even benefited from, a last-minute
attack by Gorbachev, who accused him of working toward the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.
   Despite his conciliatory statements, Yeltsin at times seemed to
be baiting Gorbachev. Asked by reporters whether he thought leaders
should hold top posts in both the Communist Party and government,
Yeltsin said:
   ``I am against combining any post in one person. And I am
talking not just about the chairmanship of the party at the Russian
level, at the regional level, or at the local level.''
   It was an oblique call for Gorbachev _ Soviet president and
Soviet Communist Party general secretary _ to give up one post.
   Yeltsin on Wednesday urged making the Soviet Union a federation
of strong states that can overrule Gorbachev's central government
on most matters.
   Outlining his plans at a news conference in the Grand Kremlin
Palace, the radical populist reformer said he would seek
sovereignty for Russia within his first 100 days in office.
   He also demanded that Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov resign
for what he called a failure to deal decisively with the country's
economic turmoil, and said he would open treaty talks immediately
with the secessionist Baltic republics.
   ``We must turn this pyramid on its head,'' Yeltsin said.
   Yeltsin attacked the reform program that Ryzhkov presented one
week ago, touching off panic buying by outlining plans to double
food prices Jan. 1 and triple the price of bread on July 1. The run
on provisions prompted Moscow officials to bar non-residents from
stores in the capital.
   ``Regrettably, the ... (national) leadership and government at
this point is losing the trust of the nation,'' he said. ``I do
think we should demand its resignation.''
   Yeltsin outlined a far more radical program than that of
Gorbachev. The price increases Ryzhkov seeks would be part of a
transition to a partial market economy in the next five years.
Yeltsin wants faster steps toward a market economy, but opposes
sharp price increases, an apparent contradiction.
   In addition, under Yeltsin's plan, Russia and the other 14
Soviet republics would remain within a reconstituted Soviet Union
but have far more power than the central government in most
matters, excluding defense and national security.
   ``We must withstand the diktat of the center,'' Yeltsin said.
``If we withstand 100 days, if we are not pulled down ... Russia
will be independent in every respect. It will make its own
decisions. Russian laws must take priority over the union
(national) laws.
   ``The Russian constitution must precede the union constitution.''
   Any declaration of Russian sovereignty must be approved by the
Russian Congress, of which Yeltsin is chairman, or president.
   The Russian Congress is a newly created body that is the highest
authority in the Russian republic. As its leader, Yeltsin will play
a major role in shaping his own powers and duties.

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Thousands Flock To Memorial For Moslem Clergyman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>

   Moslem militants today fired automatic
weapons in the air and swore to die for an independent Kashmir as
300,000 mourners paid tribute to Kashmir's top Islamic leader,
assassinated last week.
   The conservative Hindu newspaper said ``elements of three
divisions'' have been transferred from India's east to the troubled
states of Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir. The report, quoting senior
officials, was the first mention in the Indian press of a believed
troop build-up on India's border with Pakistan.
   The Associated Press earlier reported that three divisions,
amounting to 30,000 men, were moved into the region from India's
northeastern border areas.
   The newspaper report said officials declined to specify how many
troops have been moved into Jammu-Kashmir, the site of a bloody
campaign for independence from mostly Hindu India, or Punjab where
Sikh militants have also been battling for a separate homeland.
   India blames Pakistan for the troubles, especially in Kashmir
where it accuses Pakistan of training and arming Moslem militants.
Pakistan denies the claim and says India is brutally crushing a
movement for self-determination. Relations between the two
countries have sunk to their lowest point in years.
   Since independence from British rule, India and Pakistan have
fought three wars, two over Kashmir, in 1948 and 1965.
   The Hindu said the purpose of the troop transfer was to further
seal India's borders with Pakistan to prevent reported
infiltrations of Pakistani-trained or armed militants. It said
India's director general of military operations had informed the
Pakistan army of the build-up.
   In Kashmir, hundreds of thousands of mourners of the slain
clergyman, Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, filled the roads and dirt paths
to a prayer ground 13 miles from Srinagar.
   Farooq was killed May 21 by three unidentified gunmen. A few
hours later, security forces fired on crowds carrying his body,
killing at least 58 people. It was one of the worst days of
violence since Jan. 20, when India launched a crackdown on the
separatist movement in Kashmir valley. So far at least 480 people
have been killed.
   At the prayer ground ceremony Kashmiri militants stood on a
stage and fired their guns in the air.
   A young man, saying he represented a coalition of about a dozen
militant groups, spoke to the crowd, blaming Farooq's death on
security forces and accusing the government of trying to split the
movement by killing the clergyman. The government has denied the
charge.
   ``We are united and will fight for the cause of freedom,'' he
said. ``We will talk with our guns.''
   He urged Kashmir's people to burn every Indian product they
owned, beginning Friday.
   The Moslem insurgency in Kashmir stems from the region's
division along a still-disputed frontier between predominantly
Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan after the two countries were
partitioned along religious lines in 1947. Kashmir was mainly
Moslem, but its Hindu maharajah, or king, opted to join India
instead of Pakistan.
   Today, the Indian-governed part of Kashmir is incorporated into
the state of Jammu-Kashmir, the only one in India with a Moslem
majority. Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people
are Moslems, but nationwide Moslems acount for only 12 percent of
India's 880 million people.

   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was slightly
injured in a collision between his limousine and a military bus on
the outskirts of Moscow, the official Tass news agency said today.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, asked at a
regular news briefing about the accident early Wednesday, said the
premier received some bumps but ``feels just fine.''
   Tass also said another person in the premier's car and one of 20
soldiers in the bus were slightly injured.
   Earlier, the Interfax news service reported the accident but
said Ryzhkov had not been injured.
   Just before the accident, the bus was approaching Ryzhkov's
limousine on Rublyovskoe Shosse, a highway on the western edge of
Moscow that leads to country houses outside the capital where top
officials live. Fleets of black ZIL limousines often are seen
traveling along the highway at high speed.
   Tass, quoting Moscow Interior Ministry official Boris
Koryakovtsev, said a security car in Ryzhkov's motorcade alerted
the bus by flashing its lights, and the bus pulled aside.
   ``The bus's wheels struck the curb, the bus spun and blocked the
road, prompting the collision,'' Tass quoted Koryakovtsev as saying.
   Interfax had reported that the accident occurred Wednesday
evening, and that a car following Ryzhkov's had collided with the
rear end of the premier's limousine when it braked for the bus.
   Ryzhkov, 60, is the head of the Soviet government. Last week, he
presented an economic reform program that spurred panic buying in
Moscow and other cities as residents sought to stock up before
state-controlled prices go up.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly elected president of the Russian
republic, told his first news conference Wednesday that Ryzhkov and
his government should resign because the public has lost confidence
in it.

   No, midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy

because of a mistake by a printing contractor.
   ``The Seal of the Navel Academy is hereunto affixed,'' read the

   ``Yes, there was an error... made on the part of a commercial
printer by the Navy,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, the Naval

detected the error, but there was not sufficient time to make
corrections prior to graduation ceremonies this morning.''
   Van Dyke said the printer has agreed to reprint the diplomas and
distribute them to graduates at no cost to the government.
   ``We're trying to look on the bright side,'' he said. ``There
are 990 of our graduates tonight with a very unique souvenir from
the Naval Academy _ and that's with an A.''

   Why is Montreal's flag flying over Boston City
Hall today?
   Because Montrealers walloped Bostonians when it came to
exercising for 15 minutes Wednesday, that's why.
   A total of 328,258 people from the Boston area called into the
local YMCA Wednesday saying they had exercised for a quarter-hour,
compared with 425,787 residents of Montreal, said Gerdy Weiss, a
spokeswoman for the YMCA.
   The whole thing ran on the honor system. Callers didn't even
have to huff and puff as proof.
   Any activity that raised the heartbeat for 15 minutes counted
for points in the second annual Boston vs. Montreal Challenge, the
brainchild of a Montreal-based fitness organization called
Participaction.
   For its punishment, Bostonians this morning got to see
Montreal's flag flying over City Hall.
   Two inches of rain and 25 mph wind kept 67-year-old Ellie Marino
indoors. So she just paced up and down three flights of stairs in
her Charlestown home.
   ``I had a stroke two years ago so I'm doing great,'' Mrs. Marino
said after calling the Challenge Hotline to register her
quarter-hour of civic exertion. ``People got to keep going, that's
the thing.''
   Jane Flynn, a 32-year-old housewife in Marshfield, jogged a
little, did jumping jacks and then switched on her calisthenics
tape before she called the hotline.
   ``I'm not really that great about exercising every day, so this
is a little inspiring to get me going,'' she said.
   Organizers planned to use a plaza outside City Hall for daylong
athletic activities, from basketball to Hula Hooping and hopscotch.
But until the rain stopped around midday, the only people around
were dressed up as giant bags of popcorn, giving away samples.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, a regular entrant in the Boston Marathon,
postponed his run around the city to the afternoon.
   Exercising brain and muscle power, about 400 Boston
schoolchildren went for an urban hike along the Boston Women's
Heritage Trail.
   In Montreal, the temperature was about the same, in the high
50s. But winds were a milder 10 mph and the sun was out.
   Montreal is much like Boston in size and ambiance. Last year,
Boston lost to Montreal, 420,868 to 248,328.
   Montreal Mayor Jean Dore got things moving in the morning,
riding behind a chauffeur on a tandem bicycle, and then joined in a
large public aerobics class. Corporations marshaled their employees
for 15-minute walks and Montrealers could catch games of volleyball
or concentrate in a spell of tai chi.

<HEAD>Calif. Judge Rules Illegal Aliens Must Pay Out-of-State College
Tuition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal aliens who live in California are not
eligible for the in-state tuition discount at California
universities and must pay the amount charged out-of-state
residents, a judge ruled.
   Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe issued a 10-day stay of his
ruling Wednesday to allow attorneys for the University of
California Board of Regents to appeal.
   Charles Pereyra-Suarez, attorney for the regents, said he would
discuss an appeal with the regents.
   Yaffe ruled on a lawsuit by David P. Bradford, 35, who claimed
he was forced to resign from his job at the University of
California, Los Angeles, in 1985 after he refused to enroll
undocumented students.
   Bradford, who processed student applications for residency
status, contended the state has spent up to $13 million over the
past five years to subsidize illegal aliens who pay in-state
tuition.
   Yaffe cited a 1984 opinion by state Attorney General John Van de
Kamp finding that under the California Education Code undocumented
aliens were not legal residents for tuition purposes.
   UCLA attorney David Birnbaum said the university's tuition
policy conformed to a 1985 Alameda County Superior Court order
requiring campus registrars to treat aliens' residency applications
the same way they would for U.S. citizens.
   Under the order, California students who were in the United
States illegally were eligible for state financial aid as well as
in-state tuition rates.
   California residents pay an average $1,633 per year in tuition
at state universities, compared with an average $7,432 per year
paid by out-of-state residents, according to a regents spokesman.
   Peter Schey, director of the Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law, said Wednesday's ruling would be unenforceable.
   ``The university is not in a position to become the second line
of defense to the Border Patrol,'' he said. Schey successfully
argued a 1982 case that allowed children of undocumented workers to
attend public schools in Texas.
   State universities, Schey added, ``have neither personnel nor
expertise to evaluate the immigration status of every student or
potential student. It would take an army of immigration agents to
figure that out.''
   Bradford's lawsuit contesting his firing has yet to go to trial.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 grafs to UPDATE with secret police headquarters
placed under protection. Pickup 3rd graf, `The plotters...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The peaceful revolution that swept away Communist
rule in Czechoslovakia six months ago was engineered jointly by
leaders of the secret police in Moscow and Prague, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   In Prague today, police chief major Pavel Hoffman said secret
police headquarters have been put under special protection after a
heated debate of seveal dismissed agents ended up in personal
threats.
   A BBC television documentary contends that secret police leaders
in both the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia conspired to bring down
the hard-line Communist leadership in Prague because it rejected
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union.
   The plotters planned for more reform-minded Communists to
replace the hard-liners but miscalculated the depth of public
desire for change, said John Simpson, the BBC foreign affairs
editor.
   Milan Hulik, an investigator for the Czechoslovak parliamentary
commission probing the plot, told the BBC it was not yet known if
the revolution was instigated by the Czechoslovak secret police or
the Soviet KGB.
   ``But all the facts point to KGB connivance,'' he said. ``We
cannot reach any conclusion other than that the whole affair had
been given the blessing of the Soviet political leadership.''
   The plotters on the Czechoslovak side are now under
investigation and some are in prison, charged with misusing their
positions as public officials, while a parliamentary inquiry into
the plot continues, Simpson said.
   The 50-minute news program, ``Czech-Mate: Inside the
Revolution,'' was broadcast on BBC-TV late Wednesday.
   The Gorbachev administration has also been reported to have had
a hand in the nearly concurrent fall of Erich Honecker, the former
East German Communist leader who had resisted implimenting
Soviet-style reforms.
   Simpson said the spark that ignited the Czechoslovak plot was
the erroneous report of a death of a youthful demonstrator during
an officially sanctioned march in Prague on Nov. 17. The
demonstration marked the 50th anniversary of the murder of a Prague
student by Nazi troops in 1939.
   The plotters believed a death during the November commemoration
``would provoke a hostile reaction,'' Simpson said.
   According to the BBC report, several thousand young
demonstrators were lured into a narrow street leading to Wenceslas
Square by Lt. Ludek Zivcak, a secret policeman who had infiltrated
the student movement.
   The documentary showed a photograph of Zivcak apparently urging
the marchers to take the narrow street which had not been part of
the original route of the demonstration.
   Once in the street, marchers were hemmed in by police and
brutally beaten. About 560 people were injured.
   Zivcak fell to the ground, his body was covered with a blanket
and an unmarked ambulance took the body away. The event sparked
rumors that riot police had beaten to death a student named Martin
Smid.
   In the days that followed, people poured into Wenceslas Square
in the heart of the capital to mourn the death and the protests
grew.
   Demonstrations continued even after the only two students named
Martin Smid at Prague University were shown to be alive.
   The mass protests finally brought about the downfall of
hard-line President Gustav Husak's government, the creation of
Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist government in four decades and
the election to the presidency of playwright Vaclav Havel, the
country's best-known opposition figure.
   Simpson said the chief plotters were the Cezchoslovak secret
police chief, General Alois Lorenc; the KGB head in Prague, General
Teslenko (first name unavailable), and KGB deputy chairman General
Viktor Grushko.
   He said they monitored the Nov. 17 demonstration together in
Prague and Grushko returned to Moscow the next day.
   The plotters' candidate to replace Communist Party chief Milos
Jakes was Zdenek Mlynar, who had been a leading figure in Alexander
Dubcek's doomed reform government in 1968.
   Mlynar, a friend of Gorbachev when they were law school students
together in Moscow, had been purged by his own Communist leaders in
1969.
   But Mlynar did not want the job when it was proposed to him and
Havel and his non-Communist Civic Forum were ushered into power by
popular acclaim.

   A half-dozen accordions stand on Lawrence
``Shine'' Mouton's kitchen table, the result of hundreds of hours
of work and decades of experience.
   ``My daddy was a musician _ Amadia Breaux. He composed `Jolie
Blonde.' I tried to learn to play ... but didn't learn to play as
well as he did,'' said Mouton, 63. ``I said if I couldn't play, I'd
learn to make 'em.''
   Mouton's name is now as well known among Cajun musicians as his
stepfather's. His accordions are played by such performers as the
popular ``Zydecajun'' musician Wayne Toups, and Jimmy Basile of
Cajun Tradition, the Mamou group nominated for a Grammy award this
year.
   As Cajun music and its spinoffs have become more popular, so has
Mouton's craft. About 45 people now make the little German-style
squeeze boxes, most of them in little backyard sheds.
   ``I figured I wasn't any dumber than the next fellow. I figured
if he could make it, I could make it too,'' said John Elton Doucet,
whose workshop is in his grocery store. ``The first one wasn't too,
too good. But then the second one was good.''
   Doucet makes six to 10 accordions a year. It's painstaking work.
The flat metal reeds and the bellows are imported from Italy, but
everything else is made by hand.
   Or at least adapted. For instance, many people make the big
silver buttons on the left end of the accordion from chrome-plated
chair glides. They snip off the little prongs, solder a wood screw
onto the back and fill in the curve with lead.
   ``You drill a hole, and it's all threaded and ready to go,''
said Larry Miller, who makes accordions only for his family but
makes and sells Cajun triangles, spoons set in wooden blocks so
they're easy to use as a rhythm instrument and the
over-the-shoulder style metal washboards used by Zydeco bands.
   The four wooden stops used to close off the four sets of
accordion reeds are made from cabinetwork spindles. And tiny coiled
screws inside the accordion were made to put tension on stereo
tuning knobs.
   Some people paint their accordions, others varnish them to show
off fine-grained woods. The long curved half-dowels which open or
close the reeds often are covered with gold Mylar tape, which gives
even more glitter than the once traditional gold paint and is a lot
easier to apply.
   Miller said he began learning to play the accordion because of a
lecture from Cajun music great Dewey Balfa, after an assembly at
the school where Miller was principal. Miller told Balfa that his
father had made triangles and played accordion, but none of his
brothers or he had kept it up.
   ``He said, `If you're concerned about it dying in your family,
it'll probably be your fault _ you were the one that broke the
chain,''' recounted Miller. ``It hit me like a ton of bricks. Three
days later, I went and bought an accordion and commenced to
learning.''
   About seven years later, he started thinking about making the
instruments. He was influenced by stories he had heard about Mouton
and a few other men who had loved the instrument so much that,
after repairing and re-repairing German instruments made before
World War II, they started making their own.
   Strictly speaking, the Cajun accordion is a melodeon or diatonic
accordion _ a very different instrument from the big piano
accordion popular shortly after the turn of the century.
   For one thing, the Cajun accordion is much smaller. It's about
11 inches high and six inches deep, and will squeeze down to 14
inches across. It weighs about eight pounds _ less than a third the
weight of its big cousin.
   It's held on with a strap around the back of the left hand and a
smaller strap for the right-hand thumb, and played like a
hand-driven harmonica. Each of the 10 right-hand buttons gives two
notes: one when the accordion is squeezed, the other when it's
pulled out.
   The 28-pound piano accordion can't be held up without heavy
padded shoulder straps. Its two-octave keyboard is twice as long as
the Cajun accordion's little row of buttons; each key always plays
the same note.
   Since it does have all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, it can
play in any key while the Cajun accordion is limited to four _ if a
player is particularly adept _ and plays every note of the scale
only in one.
   However, Cajun accordion makers say that their instrument can
overpower the bigger one, because it has four sets of melody reeds.
   German accordions began showing up in Cajun country around the
1890s, and quickly upstaged the quieter fiddle as lead instrument.
World War II stopped imports, and the factories were destroyed or
converted to other uses.
   Factories resumed making accordions later, but the style popular
in Louisiana _ four sets of reeds controlled by one set of buttons
_ wasn't used much elsehwere.
   Mouton, Charlie Ortego and Sidney Brown and Marc Savoy are
generally considered the pioneers of modern-day accordion building.
   Mouton began making accordions in 1961, opening up his father's
old German-made Sterling accordion and using it as a reference.
   In 1970, heart trouble forced him to choose between a transfer
and retirement from work as a civil engineer for Conoco. His hobby
became his full-time job.
   ``Not to say a living. I don't make that much money making
accordions, because the cost of reeds and bellows is so high,'' he
said.
   Those two parts are ordered from Italy and cost hundreds of
dollars. Reed makers don't give any discounts, Miller said, but he
and about 25 other accordion makers recently began ordering bellows
together.
   ``I remember when you could buy reeds for $5 a set,'' said
Mouton. Now, the cheapest reeds are $90, and bellows start at $150
_ and those are for a brand scorned as vastly inferior to those
made in Italy.
   Importing presents other problems. ``I ordered some reeds Oct.
19, 1989. They have my money. I still don't have the reeds,'' said
Mouton.
   Mouton still works in a little backyard shed, though his heart
problems have cut back to six or seven hours a day and about 20
accordions a year. A friend has begun cutting out the wooden parts
for him to put together.
   Photographs of his father and his wife, Betty, stand on a shelf
over his workbench. On the walls are a plaque naming Breaux to the
Cajun Musicians Hall of Fame in 1984, musicians' signed promotion
photographs, and several Wayne Toups posters, one of them
inscribed, ``To Mr. Shine _ thanks for being a special friend.''
   Mouton opens a corner cabinet.
   ``This is my daddy's old accordion. He bought it in 1918 for
$7.50. I don't know what it would cost today. But I turned down
$2,500 for it.''

<HEAD>Israeli Reserve Officer Charged in Colombian Arms Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today charged a high-ranking reserve
officer and a company he heads with illegally providing military
expertise and equipment to a group of civilians in Colombia.
   The defendant, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, is also wanted in that South
American country for allegedly helping to train fighters for
cocaine cartels.
   The case involving Klein and his Hod Hahanit, or ``spearhead''
company, has prompted wide debate in Israel over the practice of
retired military officers working as mercenaries overseas.
   Klein's company is defined in the charges as an organization
that trains and builds counterterrorist fighting squads.
   The four-page charge sheet makes no mention of the Colombian
charges that Klein was involved in training assassination teams for
the Medellin drug cartel. Klein has vigorously denied such
allegations.
   A copy of the charge sheet provided to The Associated Press
charges Klein with making an illegal deal with a group known as the
Farmers' Organization in Colombia around April 1988.
   The illegal-export charges by the Jerusalem Magistrates Court do
not give details on the farmers' group. Klein maintained earlier
that he had legally provided training to a group of Colombian
cattlemen.
   Klein, who was involved in secret counterterrorist operations
with the Israeli army, came under investigation in August.
   At the time, Colombia sought him in connection with a spate of
drug-related shootings. Klein is still wanted in Colombia for
allegedly organizing, training and equipping paramilitary groups
for drug traffickers. He has been declared a fugitive from justice
and may be tried in absentia.
   He was also questioned by Israeli police last month for an
alleged role in the illegal diversion of weapons destined for
Antigua to the Medellin cartel. He has denied any such involvement.
   An Antiguan Commission of Inquiry opens hearings on the case
Friday.
   The Israeli court has charged Klein with three counts:
negotiating to sell military expertise without a license, the
actual sale of expertise, and the unlawful sale of equipment such
as weapons, belts and night gun-scopes.
   Such actions violate a 1986 law on the export of Israeli goods
and services and a 1956 law on the activities of reservists, the
charge sheet says.
   The charges carry a maximum three-year sentence, army radio
reported. No trial date has been set.
   The Maariv newspaper said state prosecutor Uzi Hasson plans to
call a number of Defense Ministry officials to the stand.
   Also named in the charge sheet is a man identified as Yitzhak
Ben Shimon Shoshani. He is charged with mediating Klein's
negotiations for the illegal deals and direct involvement in the
illegal export of military equipment.

   That's what most people call it anyway. Now, Michigan Bell is
changing the name of its service from Directory Assistance to
Information. The service goes beyond giving out telephone numbers,
to offering area code information or emergency numbers, Michigan
Bell said.
   When the service began shortly after the turn of the century, it
was called Information. In 1967, it was changed to Directory
Assistance. In 1971, the name was changed to New Number
Information. A decade later, it returned to Directory Assistance.
   The return to Information completes the circle, Eileen Dixon, a
Michigan Bell spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
   The rules for use of the number are the same _ 20 calls to
Information a month are free with residential service. More calls
cost 22 cents each.

   No, midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy

because of a mistake by a printing contractor.
   ``The Seal of the Navel Academy is hereunto affixed,'' read the

   ``Yes, there was an error... made on the part of a commercial
printer by the Navy,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, the Naval

detected the error, but there was not sufficient time to make
corrections prior to graduation ceremonies this morning.''
   Van Dyke said the printer has agreed to reprint the diplomas and
distribute them to graduates at no cost to the government.
   ``We're trying to look on the bright side,'' he said. ``There
are 990 of our graduates tonight with a very unique souvenir from

<HEAD>University of South Carolina President Resigns; Spending Was

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the University of South
Carolina has resigned after weeks of criticism about lavish
spending on fund-raising trips and hiring of celebrities as
visiting teachers.
   James B. Holderman, 54, who has headed the 40,000-student state
university since 1977, will step down on July 1.
   Holderman made no reference to the controversy when he announced
his resignation Wednesday, and declined to answer reporters'
questions. He read from a statement in front of his home on the
campus in downtown Columbia.
   ``For my whole family, this has been more than a job, it has
been a total commitment,'' he said. ``In our collective judgment,
we have determined that it is time to pursue new personal and
professional challenges.''
   Holderman regularly used luxury hotels while on fund-raising
trips; hired $35-an-hour chauffeured limousine services in
Washington; and frequently chartered jets or flew first class,
according to records from the university and private foundations
affiliated with the school.
   Holderman argued that expensive hotel rooms were necessary to
woo wealthy donors, and said his critics overlooked the fact that
he has helped raise $22.5 million in the past year.
   Much of the money spent came from the president's discretionary
account, which is funded not from tax revenue but from such things
as profits from campus vending machine sales.
   As a result of the controversy, the board of trustees last week
implemented guidelines aimed at limiting his expenses, forcing him
to obtain prior approval for exceptional spending and making him
more accountable for funds spent.
   Critics said Holderman's spending was excessive since during the
same period he told lawmakers courses were being canceled for lack
of state funds.
   Holderman first came under criticism in 1986 for lavish spending
on his travels, for giving expensive gifts to donors and students
and for paying top dollar to lure celebrity lecturers and speakers
to the school.
   Jihan Sadat, widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was paid
$200,000 to teach a course in Egyptian culture for three semesters
in 1985 and 1986.
   More recently, the school has drawn criticism for paying
actor-director Robby Benson $158,367 to teach filmmaking and
$15,600 for rent, with Holderman kicking in $10,000 from his
discretionary fund for travel and moving expenses.
   Board of Trustees chairman Michael Mungo said the board did not
pressure Holderman to resign, though he acknowledged that criticism
of the university because of the spending should end with
Holderman's departure.

   The Dow Jones industrial average is cruising
toward the once-unimaginable 3,000 mark in what analysts call a
signal that the bull market of the 1980s has shrugged off both
scandal and the crash of 1987.
   In less than five weeks from April 27 through Wednesday, the
oldest and best known measure of trends in stock prices surged
233.51, or 8.8 percent, to an all-time high of 2,878.56. It needed
only a 4.2 percent advance to reach 3,000.
   In today's early trading, the Dow edged even higher, rising 4.98
to 2,883.54 by 11 a.m.
   Many traders and money managers minimized the significance of
the milestone. The average of 30 blue chip stocks does not
necessarily mirror what is happening to the hundreds of other
substantial companies.
   Still, ``I think it is a big psychological target,'' said Robert
Stovall, president of Stovall-Twenty-First Advisers Inc.
   A move to 3,000 in the Dow any time soon would come less than 3{
years after the average first broke 2,000, in January 1987. That
kind of pace has few parallels in the history of the century-old
average.
   It first touched 1,000 in 1966, faltered badly in the bear
markets of 1969-70 and 1973-74 and did not break 1,000 decisively
until early 1983.
   Analysts are skeptical about the significance of a 3,000 Dow for
the economy as a whole. During much of the 1980s, and again more
recently, the market has staged its strongest advances during
periods of sluggish economic growth.

   Here is the text of the arrival ceremony at
the White House for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   President Bush: Friends and distinguished guests, welcome to all
of you, especially our guest from the Soviet Union. It is my great
honor to welcome to the White House the President of the Soviet
Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. President, just _ (applause)
   Mr. President, just over a year ago I said that the United
States wanted to move beyond containment in its relations with the
Soviet Union, toward a new era, an era of enduring cooperation.
   When we last met in Malta we agreed to accelerate our efforts on
a full range of issues. Today differences remain, of course, but in
the short six months since the Malta summit we have made
encouraging progress and I want this summit to take us further
still, and I know that that is your view as well, Mr. President.
   We have seen a world of change this past year and now on the
horizon we see what just one short year ago seemed a distant dream,
a continent truly divided East and West, has begun to heal with the
dawn of self-determination and democracy.
   In Germany where the Wall once stood, a nation moves toward
unity, and peace, and freedom, and in the other nations of the most
heavily militarized continent on earth, at last we see the long era
of confrontation giving way to the prospect of enduring cooperation
in a Europe whole and free.
   Mr. President, you deserve great credit for your part in these
transforming events. I salute you, as well, for the process of
change you've brought to your own country.
   As we begin this summit, let me stress that I believe we can
work together at this historic momewnt to further the process of
building a new Europe, one in which every nation's security is
strengthened and no nation is threatened.
   Around the world, we need to strengthen our cooperation in
solving regional conflicts and building peace and stability. In
Nicaragua, for example, we've shown that we can work together to
promote peaceful change.
   In Angola, our support for an early resolution of that country's
tragic conflict is a resolution acceptable to the Angolan people,
is now paying off.
   So let us expand this new spirit of cooperation, not merely to
resolve disputes between us, but to build a solid foundation for
peace, prosperity and stability around the world.
   In that same spirit, Mr. President, let me quote the words of
one of your nation's great minds, one of the world's great men in
this or any age, Andrei Sakharov.
   Fourteen years ago, he wrote, ``I am convinced that guaranteed
political and civil rights for people the world over are also
guarantees of international security, economic and social
progress.''
   Sakharov knew that lasting peace and progress are inseparable
from freedom, that nations will only be fully safe when all people
are fully free.
   And we in the U.S. applaud the new course the Soviet Union has
chosen. We see the spirited debate in the Congress of People's
Deputies, in the Soviet press, among the Soviet people.
   We know about the difficult economic reforms that are necessary
to breathe new vigor into the Soviet economy, and as I've said many
times before, we want to see perestroika succeed. (Applause.)
   Mr. President, I firmly believe, as you have said, that there is
no turning back from the path you have chosen. Since our meeting in
Malta, we have reached agreements in important areas, each one
proof that when mutual respect prevails, progress is possible.
   But the agreements we've reached cannot cause us to lose sight
of some of the differences that remain. Lithuania is one such issue.
   We believe that good faith dialogue between the Soviet leaders
and representatives of the Baltic peoples is the proper approach
and we hope to see that process go forward.
   Over the next four days we're not going to solve all of the
worlds problems, we won't resolve all of the outstanding issues
that divide us, but we can and will take significant steps toward a
new relationship.
   This summit will be a working summit in the strictest sense of
the term, one where we mark the real progress we've made by signing
new agreements and where we address the differences that divide us
in a spirit of candor, in an open and honest search for common
ground.
   In a larger sense, though, the success of this summit depends
not on the agreements we will sign, but on our efforts to lay the
groundwork for overcoming decades of division and discord, to build
a world of peace in freedom.
   Mr. President, together, your great country and ours bear an
enormous and unique responsibility for world peace and regional
stability.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We must work together to reduce tensions, to make the world a
little better for our children and grandchildren. And to this end,
I pledge you my all-out effort. (Applause.)
   Mr. President, you brought us a beautiful day, and you brought
back Mrs. Gorbachev that brings joy to all of our hearts. A hearty
welcome to her as well.
   And _ (applause) _ so it is my _ (applause) _ so it is my
privilege to welcome you to the White House. And may God bless our
peoples in their efforts for a better world. Welcome, sir.
(Applause.)

   President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
reached their first agreement even before their summit talks began
today. They decided not to answer reporters' questions in the Oval
Office.
   The switch from the policy observed by President Reagan, who
allowed questions during summit photo sessions in his office, was
engineered by Bush as he posed with the Soviet leader for cameramen
and photographers moments before their first round of talks.
   ``I do not take questions during photo opportunities in the Oval
Office,'' Bush explained as the reporters crowded into the room.
   ``If they yell questions at you, which they're unlikely to do,
but if they did, you should feel free to answer if you want,'' Bush
told his guest.
   A reporter immediately asked Gorbachev about his differences
with Bush on the issue of a united Germany.
   ``I've been told by the president that the current policy is
that there are no questions during the photo opportunity,''
Gorbachev said. He promised they would report later to the press on
their talks.

   President Gorbachev:
   Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, thank
you for this welcome. May I also greet all Americans on behalf of
the peoples of the Soviet Union?
   My present visit to the United States is a confirmation that
Soviet-U.S. relations are acquiring greater stability, clarity and
predictability. I am convinced that both the Soviet people and the
Americans approve such changes. I think that they are also properly
appreciated throughout the world.
   Therefore, it is the great responsibility of the President and
myself to make sure that the capital of trust and cooperation
accumulated in recent years is protected and constantly increased.
   I remember well my first visit to the United States, and not
only because I saw America for the first time then. During those
days in December 1987, President Reagan and I signed the treaty on
the elimination of INF missiles.
   That was truly a watershed, not only in our relations, but in
the history of modern times. It was the first step taken together
by two powerful countries on the road leading to a safe and
sensible world.
   Since then, our two great nations have traveled a long way
toward each other. Thousands of American and Soviet citizens,
dozens of agencies, private companies and public organizations are
involved in political and business contacts, humanitarian
exchanges, scientific and technological cooperation.
   In the same years, the world around us has also changed beyond
recognition.
   Mr. President, this generation of people on earth may witness
the advent of an irreversible period of peace in the history of
civilization. The walls which for years separated the peoples are
collapsing. The trenches of the cold war are disappearing. The fog
of prejudice, mistrust, and animosity is vanishing. (Applause.)
   I have come to the United States with the impressions still
fresh in my mind of how our people celebrated the 45th anniversary
of the victory over Nazism, and of my meetings with war veterans.
   I have recently had many meetings with my countrymen. They all
understand the importance of Soviet-U.S. relations.
   They look upon their improvement with hope that the tragedies of
the 20th century, those horrible wars, will forever remain a thing
of the past. I think that this is what the Americans want, too.
(Applause.)
   Mr. President, living up to these hopes of our two nations is
your mission and mine. This meeting is part of it.
   My colleagues and I have come to do serious work in order to
make a decisive step toward an agreement reducing the most
dangerous arms which are increasingly losing their political
significance, and to provide further impetus to interaction between
our two countries, interaction and of course cooperation in solving
international problems in trade, scientific, technological, and
humanitarian fields and cultural exchanges, in expanding
information about each other and in people to people contact.
   We want progress in relations between the Soviet Union and the
United States of America.
   I am looking forward to meeting with the Americans and, to the
extent possible, getting to know better your unique and great
country.
   On behalf of Mrs. Gorbachev and myself and of all those who have
come with me to your nation's capital, I thank once again President
George Bush and all those present here for this warm welcome.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed two policemen in the
cocaine capital of Medellin today, bringing to 42 the number of law
officers killed in that city this month, police said.
   Security forces in Medellin also found an abandoned car
containing nearly 80 pounds of dynamite, a Metropolitan Police
spokesman said in an interview.
   A series of bombs exploded in Medellin and several other cities
in the two weeks preceding Sunday's presidential elections, killing
37 people and wounding about 350.
   Authorities have blamed the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel for
the bombings and assassinations of policemen.
   The cartel has offered to pay $4,300 to anyone willing to kill a
policeman. The bounty for a member of Colombia's Elite Police
Corps, a group specially trained to fight drug traffickers, is said
to be as high as $10,000.
   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the two policemen were killed by unidentified gunmen in two
separate attacks today in southern Medellin.
   So far this year, 324 policemen have been slain in Colombia, an
average of two a day, police said.
   On Sunday, Colombians elected Cesar Gaviria, 43, of the
governing Liberal Party, to be their next president. Of the four
major candidates, Gaviria took the toughest line against drug
traffickers. He said he favors extraditing them to the United
States and opposes negotiating with them.
   He takes office Aug. 7, when President Virgilio Barco steps down.

raising the overall death toll to 126.
   Ms. Bhutto has rejected demands to dismiss the government of
Sindh Province, headed by her Pakistan People's Party, and bring it
under control of the federal government in Islamabad.
   Instead, she has called out the army to help restore law and
order.
   Soldiers and local security troops were patrolling the largely
deserted streets of Karachi, the capital of Sindh and the country's
financial and industrial hub.
   Most shops and businesses, including the Karachi Stock Exchange,
have been closed this week because of around-the-clock curfews that
have brought life in this city of 8 million people to a standstill.
   The army also was patrolling Hyderabad, a city of 3 million
people 150 miles to the north, after clashes there killed at least
180 people.
   The trouble is rooted in deep hatred between native Sindhis and
the Mohajirs, descendants of Moslem Indians who immigrated to
Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the subcontinent. Sindhis
accuse the better-educated Mohajirs of taking the best jobs and
most valuable land.
   Police blame the latest violence on a militant faction of the
Mohajir Qami Movement, a small political party representing the
Moslem Indian immigrants. The party is demanding recognition as
Pakistan's fifth nationality, along with the Pathans, Punjabis,
Baluch and Sindhis.
   The prime minister had planned to leave June 3 on a four-day
trip to Qatar, Iraq, Kuwait and Bahrain, to drum up support for
Pakistan in its dispute with India over the Kashmir region. Moslem
secessionists there are trying to break away from Hindu-dominated
India. India blames Pakisan, a Moslem country, for fomenting that
unrest, but Pakistan denies the charge.
   Ms. Bhutto's aides said today the two weeks of random shootings
and clashes between rival ethnic groups and security forces in
Pakistan had forced her to delay her trip, aides said.
   ``The prime minister has decided to delay her trip until some
normalcy returns,'' said one aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>New NYC Transit Police Guideline: Eject All Panhandlers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transit Authority has instituted a new
policy following court battles over begging in the subways: All
panhandlers will be ejected.
   The chief of the TA police, William J. Bratton, instituted the
new rule Wednesday and explained it to officers in a videotape.
   Bratton said that under the new stringent guidelines, all
panhandlers, even those silently holding out a cup, would be kicked
out of the subway system.
   Earlier this month, a federal appeals court threw out a lower
court's ruling that had held that begging was a constitutionally
protected form of speech. The new rules are the first attempt since
the ruling to instruct officers in how to handle beggars.
   Some forms of soliciting will still be allowed in the system,
although not on trains. They include musical performances and
requests for money for legitimate, registered charities or
religious or political groups.
   In the videotaped message, Bratton said the guidelines were
needed ``to clear up any misunderstanding and confusion'' among
officers and to ``restore order to a system that the public
believes is out of control,'' the Times said.
   Bratton asked officers to use their ``skill and experience'' in
ejecting beggars.
   The New York subway system transports roughly 3.5 million
passengers a day.

   It was a great day for flying. My wife,
my 5-year-old son and young daughter watched from the runway as we
took off.
   I've always been scared to fly. But the plane takeoff was so
smooth. I was feeling very comfortable and was talking to Duncan
much of the way.
   We flew in formation to the tanker and practiced fueling in air.
Everything was going so smoothly. ...
   I handled the plane for a couple of minutes. Then Duncan took
control for good. We took it for a roll. We went up and did some
G-force testing to see how I would react. ...
   Then he brought the squadron back together and began setting up
for combat exercises. ...
   We did the first exercise. It was pure Top Gun. ... We were
moving so fast _ I saw Duncan's head swinging around looking at the
other planes. It was very aggressive. ...
   We were engaged in a dogfight with another plane and we were the
aggressor. Suddenly, it got turned around and another pilot was the
aggressor. Duncan told me on his radio, ``Now we're on defense.''
We began going around with Greg Gore, the other pilot, in pursuit
of us. ...
   I noticed way down to the left of what I could see that Gore's
plane was coming up in an arch towards us. Duncan suddenly pointed
the nose higher and seemed to be backing off the fight. That is
when I fixed on Gore coming at us. The pilots later said they were
trying to exercise a scissor maneuver.
   Those planes go so fast, a mere second makes such a difference.
I said to myself, ``There isn't any danger. These guys are too good
of pilots. We won't collide.'' Then it became obvious he was going
to hit us.
   I saw the whites of the other pilot's eyes.
   We went up, but I think we took the hit low. He hit us from
underneath towards the tail section.
   Gore said later he thought he was going to take it right in his
canopy and he would have died instantly. ...
   Duncan hit the ejector button as soon as we hit, sending me
exploding through the canopy and him following a second later. Then
everything came apart. It was just a ball of flame. Duncan later
told me that if he had waited a couple of seconds longer to eject,
we would have been crispy critters.
   It was just a surreal scene. I was floating up in the air and my
flight suit was burning like a torch. My first thought was, ``I'll
never see my wife and kids again. This is it.''
   Pieces of the plane were going by. Flames were all over me. I
couldn't remember where the cord was to open the parachute, but it
went open automatically.
   It was like one of those movies. The plane and debris were
spiraling down below me in flames. It was completely silent up
there.
   The parachute was swinging me around. I thought, ``Oh my God.
I'm alive.''
   Then I noticed blood was dripping from my head. The only thing I
could think was, ``I wonder if I'm really seriously hurt.'' I
didn't know if half my head was blown off. I looked down at my feet
and saw my shoes were completely singed, but they were both there.
   I saw the other guys were alive. Duncan gave me the thumbs up. I
gave him the thumbs up. It was very peaceful floating down. But I
kept smelling this smell and finally figured out it was my own skin
that had burned.
   I was trying to remember everything they told me about landing _
how to avoid trees, power lines. It seemed like five minutes to get
down. It was very, very slow. The whole world was sitting out there.
   I saw people gathering in cars below us. There were a lot of
farmers there with the wreckage off in the distance. ...
   I just sort of floated down and hit kind of awkwardly. I thought
I'd broken my leg. I couldn't get out of the chute right away and
it was blowing me across the field. A farmer came out and grabbed
the chute and helped me. ...
   Duncan came along and asked me if I was all right. He said he
was sorry it had to happen.

<HEAD>Couple Wins Political Asylum After Fleeing Forced Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Chinese couple who fled their homeland
because of China's harsh family planning laws have been granted
political asylum in the United States, their lawyer said today.
   Li Jin Mu and Wang Sai Zhen are the first known refugees to be
granted asylum under an order President Bush issued last November
that established fear of forced abortion as grounds for asylum.
   At the time they fled China last year, Ms. Wang was pregnant
with the couple's second child; only one was allowed. She had
undergone several previous abortions and her doctor had warned her
another could damage her health.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service notified the
couple that they had been granted asylum late Wednesday, said the
lawyer, Kathleen Rimar. She said the letter did not specifically
mention the abortion issue.
   ``It's a form letter,'' Rimar said. ``It basically just says
that they have demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution.''
   Ealier this month, the State Department had recommended that
asylum be granted.
   Li, 37, and Ms. Wang, whose age has not been disclosed, now live
in New York City. They must undergo a follow-up interview with the
INS within a year to confirm their asylum status, Rimar said.
   After the asylum is confirmed, the couple would qualify for
permanent resident status, although it could be a few years before
they win it because of a backlog of applications, Rimar said. Five
years after becoming permanent residents, they could qualify for
citizenship.
   The couple fled their hometown of Fuzhou early last year, along
with a nephew, Chun Kong Cheung, 19, and made their way to Canada.
There, they paid smugglers about $1,500 apiece to get them into the
United States.
   The INS caught them in Albany and sent Li and Chun back to
Canada. Ms. Wang was allowed to stay because of her advanced
pregnancy and gave birth to a daughter in New York. Li and Chun
tried again to get into the United States last October, but
government agents found them in the back of a truck at a border
crossing near Buffalo.
   The three applied for asylum after Bush issued his Nov. 30
order, which was part of a directive allowing Chinese students to
stay in the United States after the Tiananmen Square massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   The couple left their first child, a 10-year-old daughter,
behind with relatives in China. They have said they would like to
go back someday and get her.
   The State Department has rejected the nephew's application for
asylum, but Rimar said she has asked it to reconsider. He is still
in the United States, but the INS is trying to have him sent back
to Canada.

<HEAD>Christian Science Father Charged in Ill Son's Death Said Boy
Seemed Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged with manslaughter in his 2{-year-old
son's death testified that the ill boy appeared to be improving the
day he died.
   David Twitchell, and his wife, Ginger, both Christian
Scientists, were charged with manslaughter because they did not
seek medical help for their son, who died of a bowel obstruction
that could have been corrected by surgery.
   The couple says they rely on spiritual healing to cure physical
ailments according to Christian Science principles.
   Twitchell took the stand Wednesday, describing the days and
hours before their son, Robyn, died in 1986. Twitchell's testimony
continued today.
   Defense attorneys have sought to show that Robyn's symptoms
resembled the flu and that he died suddenly while cradled in his
father's arms. An autopsy showed the boy had a birth defect that
caused the obstruction.
   Officials from the Christian Science Church, which is based in
Boston, contends the state of Massachusetts has put the religion
itself on trial.
   Prosecutors maintain medical attention would have saved the
boy's life, and deny that they are prosecuting the couple's
religious beliefs.
   Twitchell broke down a few times during almost three hours of
questioning by his attorney, Rikki Klieman. He became emotional
when describing the hours leading up to his son's death when the
Twitchells believed he was getting well.
   ``I remember holding him and him being quiet in my arms and then
quietly shaking,'' said Twitchell. ``It wasn't violent shaking and
it didn't last very long. After the shaking, I noticed he half
closed his eyes.''
   Twitchell then began to cry quietly and Suffolk County Superior
Court Judge Sandra Hamlin called a brief recess.
   Twitchell said he and his wife were never far from Robyn's side
during his last days. After calling in a Christian Science
practitioner two days before Robyn's death, Twitchell said he and
his wife began spoonfeeding Robyn every 30 minutes in an effort to
get him to eat.
   The day the boy died, he appeared much better, Twitchell
testified.
   ``It was like a sunny day after a hazy day,'' he said. ``We were
pleased and happy it had turned out that way. Things had appeared
to turn out so wonderfully.''
   Twitchell said he believed the boy was recovering when he
followed his father and older brother into the kitchen Tuesday
night for dinner. But after drinking some liquid, Robyn vomited,
Twitchell said.
   Later that night, the boy died in his arms, Twitchell testified.
   Twitchell called a funeral home director who told him to call
911. Operators coached him in cardiopulmonary resuscitation over
the phone, until paramedics arrived to take the child to the
hospital.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a rebel army that has
advanced to within 25 miles of Monrovia rejected any political
settlement today and vowed to seize the capital city and form a new
government.
   In another development, the United Nations canceled an emergency
food program for refugees of the civil war, and its remaining
foreign workers in Monrovia prepared to leave. It took the actions
after a U.N. compound was attacked by government soldiers Wednesday
and a guard killed.
   President Samuel Doe said today he will not resign to help end
the fighting, heightening fears that the two armies will clash in
the capital.
   Doe commented while meeting with diplomats to discuss the attack
on the U.N. compound. One diplomat quoted Doe as saying: ``I will
not resign but will be the last person to leave'' Monrovia.
   That position represented a reversal for Doe, who reportedly had
offered at an earlier date to resign if that would help end the
fighting.
   Lawmakers in the Parliament on Wednesday unanimously rejected a
request from Doe to hold early elections and install an interim
government. The lawmakers called on Doe to fulfill his promise to
resign, a source said.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor said in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corp. today that he would not be satisfied
with Doe's resignation. The rebels have accused Doe's
administration of corruption, economic mismanagement and human
rights abuses.
   The rebel forces led by Taylor, a former Doe aide, launched
their insurgency five months ago in eastern Liberia. The fighting
has killed more than 1,000 people in this West African nation of 2
million. The country was founded by freed American slaves and
became independent in 1847.
   
   Taylor, who said he was calling the BBC from the port of
Buchanan, said his fighters would not stop until they had taken
Monrovia and formed their own government. Taylor's fighters
captured the country's main port of Buchanan, 95 miles east of the
capital, five days ago.
   Rebels were reported today to be ambushing troops within a few
miles of the main Robertsfield International Airport, 20 miles from
the capital.
   The Standard newspaper in Monrovia reported that rebels had sent
a telex to the general manager of the aiport saying all employees
should evacuate because an attack would occur soon.
   Ghana Airways, the main commercial air link to Liberia, said on
Wednesday it would no longer be flying into the country. However,
several other carriers were still serving the airport.
   Bridges to Guinea were reported to have collapsed under the
heavy traffic of refugees, but roads were open to Sierra Leone.
Thousands of Liberian refugees have fled to neighboring countries.
   In Monrovia today, there were reports that members of Doe's
Krahn tribe and Mandingos, who are accused of supporting Krahns and
exploiting other tribes, were trying to evacuate for fear that
rebels would attack the capital.
   Many of the rebels are members of the Gio and Mano tribes, who
last week were the target of attacks that killed 11 people.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight soldiers
wearing masks forced their way Wednesday into the U.N. compound in
Monrovia, where 1,000 refugees had gathered to demand protection
and safe conduct out of the country after last week's killings.
   Giuliani said the soldiers killed one guard and wounded another,
then abducted about 30 people. The bodies of three abducted men and
a youth were found later that day dumped on a roadside outside the
capital. Doe denied responsibility and said he would punish those
who carried out the attack.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, officials said they were
evacuating 57 U.N. personnel still in Liberia and protesting to the
Foreign Ministry over the attack. The 11 remaining foreign
officials prepared to evacuate today.
   Terry Lewis, chief of the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in
Liberia, told reporters the evacuation means an end to an emergency
food relief program begun April 6.
   The program aimed at feeding 135,000 people displaced during the
fighting. The first mass food distribution in the capital was
scheduled for today.

<HEAD>Toxins from Rocky Mountain Arsenal Flow into South Platte River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least five toxic chemicals from the
Rocky Mountain Arsenal, including a nerve gas byproduct and two
banned pesticides, have migrated underground four miles to the
South Platte River, officials said.
   Environmental Protection Agency officials said Wednesday that
they did not believe there was any public health threat from the
wastes dumped by the Army and Shell Oil Co.
   ``When it reaches the South Platte, it's very diluted,'' said
Connally Mears, who directs an EPA-supervised cleanup at the
arsenal north of Stapleton International Airport.
   The EPA had not previously disclosed that pollution from the
arsenal was affecting the South Platte, which supplies water for
drinking and irrigation to thousands of rural northeastern Colorado
residents.
   The pollution apparently is seeping around the edges of
underground barrier systems the Army and Shell built along the
arsenal's northern and northwestern borders to cleanse groundwater.
   The 27-square-mile arsenal's contamination of groundwater dates
to the early 1950s. Shell Oil Co. manufactured pesticides at the
arsenal for 30 years beginning in 1952. Before that, the Army
manufactured and stored chemical warfare weapons there.
   EPA officials said a plume consisting of many pollutants reached
the river, but they are chiefly concerned about five: an Army nerve
gas byproduct called DIMP; PCE, an industrial solvent; chloroform;
dieldrin, a Shell pesticide banned for most uses in 1974 because of
links to cancer; and DBCP, a Shell pesticide banned for most uses
in 1979 because it can cause sterility in workers.
   ``The key uncertainty is over the long-term health effects of
DIMP,'' Mears said.
   Last month, the EPA and the Colorado Department of Health
announced plans to test wells used by 150 homes north and northwest
of the arsenal for DIMP. Results are expected this summer.

   President Bush today praised the ``process of
change'' Mikhail S. Gorbachev sparked in the Soviet Union but
wasted no time in laying out U.S. displeasure over the Soviet
president's policy in Lithuania.
   In an official greeting on the White House South Lawn, Bush
noted the ``encouraging progress'' made by the two countries since
he and Gorbachev held their first summit meeting in Malta last
December.
   However, he said, ``The agreements we've reached should not
cause us to lose sight of some of the differences that remain.
Lithuania is one such issue.''
   Reiterating the U.S. call for negotiations by the Soviets with
leaders of the breakaway republic, Bush said, ``We believe that
good faith dialogue between the Soviet leaders and representatives
of the Baltic peoples is the proper approach and we hope to see
that process go forward.''
   Gorbachev stood impassively at Bush's side as a smattering of
applause rippled across the audience of several hundred dignitaries
and guests.
   Bush greeted Gorbachev with a warm handshake and the two smiled
frequently during the ceremonial part of the official greeting at
the start of their second summit.
   ``Mr. President, you deserve great credit for your part in these
transforming events'' that have brought dramatic reform to Eastern
Europe, Bush said.
   ``I salute you as well for the process of change you've brought
to your country.''
   Bush ended his welcoming statement on a hopeful note.
   ``We are not going to solve all of the world's problems. We will
not resolve all of the outstanding differences that divide us, but
we can and will take significant steps toward a new relationship,''
he said.
   Bush came to the talks after two days of intensive briefings and
telephone talks with the leaders of Canada and West Germany.
   In a summit-eve briefing session, the president ``went through
all the possible issues that could be raised, all the points he
wants to raise with Gorbachev,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said
after attending the meeting on Wednesday.
   The president spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
on the Canadian leader's just-finished talks with Gorbachev.
   Mulroney told Bush the Ottawa talks had gone well, the White
House said in a statement shortly after Gorbachev arrived in
Washington. Bush thanked Mulroney for his report ``on the current
thinking of Mr. Gorbachev,'' the statement said.
   Going into today's talks, Bush was ``upbeat, he's confident. He
knows what he wants to talk to Gorbachev about,'' Quayle told The
Associated Press.
   High among the topics was the pending unification of Germany,
aides said.
   White House officials said Bush would hold firm on keeping
Germany in the NATO alliance, and not singling it out for special
troop reduction deals outside future talks on reducing forces
throughout Europe.
   However, officials said Bush also was prepared to listen to
Soviet concerns on the subject.
   ``We want to hear their concerns and their interests,'' said
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, adding that Bush
would be ``exploring mutually acceptable options and positions''
with Gorbachev. He said military troop levels in Germany
constituted a proper subject for ``follow-on conventional arms
control negotiations'' once a treaty to reduce troops and tanks
throughout Europe is reached.
   Other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush
was prepared to discuss with Gorbachev a formula for such talks
that could have the Western allies limit the size of the German
army in exchange for proportional cuts in the size of the Red Army
within the Soviet Union.
   Bush spent most of Wednesday in the Cabinet Room with top
advisers, as Gorbachev wrapped up a 29-hour stopover in Canada
before flying to Washington.
   Bush also consulted with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by
telephone. He held meetings earlier in the year with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``The president's mood ... is one of anticipation and
confidence,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Bush's Wednesday briefings dealt with economic and trade issues,
arms control, and on ``overview questions, the general tone and
texture of the summit,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said the agenda called for the two leaders on
Wednesday and Thursday to discuss arms control, conventional arms,
chemical weapons, trade and other issues that could lead to
``various specific agreements.''
   Fitzwater said German unity likely would be discussed in greater
depth when Gorbachev joins Bush on Saturday at the presidential
retreat in Camp David, Md.

<TEXT>
   Columbia's astronomy mission is on
hold for at least another week, and possibly longer, as NASA tries
to track down a small leak in a shuttle fuel line that caused the
launch to be scrubbed.
   Workers entered the engine compartment early today to search for
the leak after the shuttle's external fuel tank was purged of
combustible hydrogen.
   A tiny leak was found in a so-called ``flex line connector'' in
the extensive plumbing in the suspected area, but it was believed
to be too small to have leaked so much hydrogen Tuesday, said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   ``The feeling is at this point that's probably not what they're
looking for,'' Buckingham said.
   If workers can't find the main leak, the shuttle would have to
be rolled back into its hangar, NASA officials said. That would
mean about a one-month delay.
   Columbia's launch, which had been set for 12:38 a.m. Wednesday,
was scrubbed six hours before liftoff because of leaking hydrogen
during fueling of the shuttle with more than a half-million gallons
of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   It was the first time a shuttle launch had been scrubbed during
fueling. The mission already had been delayed two weeks because of
repairs to the cooling system.
   Columbia will carry into orbit seven astronauts and a $150
million observatory called Astro. The astronauts returned to
Johnson Space Center in Houston to practice liftoffs and landings
in a shuttle simulator.
   The earliest another launch could be attempted is the middle of
next week, said Bob Sieck, launch director for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   If the problem is ``something obvious that we can repair on the
pad, then we'll do that and fly,'' said Bascom Murrah, a NASA
official in charge of prelaunch operations for Columbia.
   The odds of that happening are 50-50, NASA officials said.
   Engineers believe the leak is in a 17-inch valve in a pipe that
carries fuel from the external tank to the main engine.
   The effect of the delay on the shuttle's astronomy mission was
not clear, but the postponement is likely to affect what can be
seen of Comet Austin, which was discovered last year and is
receding rapidly from the solar system.
   NASA plans to open Columbia's payload bay Friday to replenish
the argon used to keep Astro's X-ray telescope cold. Astro's three
other telescopes, which track ultraviolet radiation, have no
special needs.
   The space agency said it would proceed as planned with Friday's

   A passenger train slammed into a police

killed, newspapers reported Thursday.
   The Cairo paper Al-Akhbar said 54 civilians were injured in the
accident Wednesday afternoon at the village of Tukh, about 25 miles
north of Cairo.
   It said the crossing's stop signal was lighted, but the driver
of the police vehicle ignored it.
   The paper said the impact derailed three cars of the train,
which was headed to the city of Alexandria.

<HEAD>Australian Government Moves to Reduce TV Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government moved Thursday to
reduce the violence shown on television, particularly in news
programs.
   Transport and Communcations Minister Kim Beazley said he
supported the recommendations in the Australian Broadcasting
Tribunal's report on television violence, which was brought up for
discussion in Parliament.
   The key recommendation is that the television industry draw up a
uniform code on how to treat violence.
   Although the emphasis is on ``supervised self-regulation,''
Tribunal Chairman Deirdre O'Connor said in a separate statement
that if the code could not satisfy meet public concerns, ``the
Tribunal would be driven to consider a range of options which could
include imposing program standards and license conditions.''
   The report said there was widespread worry about the repetition
of violent images, close-ups of blood and intrusion on grieving
people.
   The overriding concern was the effect of violence on children.
   The report said it was clear that news had assumed an
overwhelming importance in the competition for evening ratings.
   The depiction of violence in sport was also criticized,
particularly slow-motion replays of brawls and the use of fighting
in promotions.

air traffic controllers warned that they would also strike.
   The airport workers, set to begin interrmittent strikes Friday,
and the railway workers want better working conditions and more

by the train strike.
   Only a third of the trains were running, causing delays of up to
two hours during the morning rush hour. It was the third major

   A truck carrying Philippine soldiers
on their way to cut bamboo ran over a land mine planted by
Communist rebels, and six soldiers were killed and four wounded,
the military said Thursday.
   Col. Benjamin Enrile, spokesman of the Philippine army, said the
attack took place Wednesday on the outskirts of Rizal in Cagayan
province, about 225 miles north of Manila.
   Enrile said soldiers from the 65th Infantry Battalion were on
their way to to cut bamboo for a construction project when their
vehicle tripped the mine.
   Following the explosion, New People's Army rebels opened fire on
the vehicle, touching off a brief gunbattle. There was no report of
rebel casualties.
   Also Thursday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos offered a $45,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of four rebels the
military says killed two American airmen near Clark Air Base on May
13.
   Ramos said witnesses identified the four as Alex Capitulo, Allan
Gutierrez, Gonzalo Bondoc and Ric Manansala. The New People's Army
claimed responsibility for killing airmen John Raven and James
Green last month.
   The killings occurred on the eve of U.S.-Philippine talks on the
future of American military bases in the Philippines. The Communist
rebels oppose an extension on the lease for the six military
facilities, which expires next year.
   The government has been fighting the Marxist rebels for 21 years.

   Two weeks ago, Kevin A. Smith was in the
library poring over Russian history and recipes. Now he's in a
restaurant kitchen preparing blue-plate specials, Soviet-style.
   Smith is a chef at the Hard Rock Cafe, one of many Washington
establishments looking for a way to capitalize on the U.S.-Soviet
summit. The cafe kicked off a special ``Glasnost Week'' on Monday
and sold out of Hard Rock summit T-shirts the same day. The
festivities continued Tuesday with a performance by Soviet
musicians and a children's choir.
   Throughout the week, Hard Rock is featuring its own menu
translated into Russian and rubles, along with Smith's daily Soviet
creations.
   Thursday's Russian special was chicken and dumplings, swordfish
with green sauce and ground chocolate cake. On Friday the curious
can order beef stroganoff, freshwater fish soup, broiled trout and
coffee cream roll.
   The regular menu, with dishes such as Bordertown guacamole,
veggie sandwiches, chiliburgers and root beer floats, was
translated for the occasion into a strange mixture of literal and
phonetic Russian.
   ``This is the best compromise,'' said translator Rudy
D'Alessandro. ``Titles transliterated into Cyrillic letters,
explanations in Russian for the people ordering _ because you can
look at a `pig sandwich' and say what is this thing, then you read
the explanation and say, `it's edible.'''
   The restaurant, which already has branches in a number of
countries, says it is planning one in Moscow.

<HEAD>East Germany Will Investigate Communist Property Holdings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German lawmakers voted today to create a
commission that will investigate and perhaps seize the vast
property held by the former Communist Party.
   The coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
asked Parliament to form a commission that would have broad powers
to seize evidence, search houses and interrogate witnesses.
   When it is created in the next few days, all property owned by
political parties and other organizations under the former regime
would be put in trust while the government decides how to dispose
of it.
   The law was passed as the young democratic government grapples
with how to convert state-owned property to private ownership, a
prerequisite to unification with West Germany.
   The two German states are to merge their economies and social
institutions on July 2, when West German currency will become the
currency of East Germany.
   The property commission is to report its findings to Parliament
by June 30.
   The commission is part of the monumental process of dismantling
the nation's vast system of state ownership.
   The proposal calls for the property of all political parties,
unions and other organizations to be investigated, but it is
clearly aimed at the former Communist regime.
   Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, leader of the reconstituted Communist
Party that now supports a form of democratic socialism, said the
government proposal was aimed at eliminating his party's role as an
opposition faction.
   ``They want all opposition eliminated,'' said Gysi, whose party
is now called the Party of Democratic Socialism. ``That is the goal
and nothing else.'' He said his party already has given up a large
part of its property.
   Richard Schroeder, leader of the Social Democratic lawmakers in
Parliament, said the proposal is aimed at merely shedding light on
who owns what in the country.
   ``We should bring clarity and light to the property
proportion,'' he said. ``We have the impression that the history of
the former Communist Party property is still being written.''
   The left-leaning Social Democrats are part of conservative de
Maiziere's coalition.
   Under the government's proposal, the property commission would
report back to the Parliament by June 30.
   The issue of distributing East German property has generated
much argument in both Germanys.
   Hans Klein, spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said on Wednesday that property seized when the Communists assumed
control of East Germany 40 years ago should be given back to the
original owners.
   More than 1 million West Germans are expected to lay claim to
property they or their ancestors left behind when fleeing after
World War II or during the Communist regime.
   East Germany wants instead to pay compensation to former owners
and let East Germans have the initial opportunity to buy the
property.
   Some West Germans already have written letters to tenants of
East German apartments, warning them that they will seek to claim
the land on which the buildings stand.
   East Germans also fear high unemployment and rising prices when
the two nations merge their economies.
   East Germans have been lining up at grocery stores to stock up
on food and other household goods, creating huge shortages of meat,
milk and other basic necessities, officials said.
   Lawmaker Vera Wollenberger said meat was selling out in stores
within one hour of opening in the cities of East Berlin and Halle.
   Commerce Minister Sybille Reider said consumer demand has
increased 300 percent to 400 percent in recent days. Soap, bread
and other goods are selling out, she said.

   President Roh Tae-woo said Thursday
his talks next week with Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be aimed at
helping to end hostility on the divided Korean peninsula.
   Roh is scheduled to meet with the Soviet president in San
Francisco on Monday after Gorbachev ends summit talks with
President Bush. Afterward, Roh is to meet Bush in Washington.
   The Roh-Gorbachev meeting will be the first between leaders of
the two nations, which have no diplomatic relations.
   The talks come at a time when economic ties between Seoul and
Moscow are rapidly increasing. Their two-way trade doubled to $600
million last year and is expected to surpass $1 billion in 1990.
   The meeting also represents the culmination of South Korea's
``northern policy,'' which is aimed at fostering ties with
Communist nations able to influence Communist North Korea. Since
that policy went into effect in July 1988, South Korea has
established formal diplomatic relations with every nation in
eastern Europe except Albania and East Germany.
   Roh said Thursday he will try to use the San Francisco talks not
only to improve ties with the Soviet Union, but also to force open
North Korea's closed society.
   The president said he would be trying to make overtures through
Gorbachev to officials in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   ``Since there is no way opened for me to go to Pyongyang, I have
to go there by way of Moscow,'' aides quoting Roh as saying.
   Chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said Roh and Gorbachev
will discuss normalizing relations between Seoul and Moscow, trade
between the two nations, and peace on the Korean peninsula.
   ``They will also discuss world affairs with emphasis on the
situation in Northeast Asia and discuss ways to help ease tension
and promote peace on the divided peninsula,'' Lee said.
   South Korea and North Korea have been arch-enemies since the
division of the peninsula in 1945. The Soviet Union is a close ally
and arms provider of North Korea.
   South and North Korea have held sporadic talks on easing
tensions, but little progress has been made.

   A commercial rocket sustained minor
damage during a test, possibly delaying its June launch with a
satellite that will study space radiation, NASA said Thursday.
   The unmanned Atlas-Centaur rocket had been scheduled to lift off
June 23 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station with the Combined
Release and Radiation Effects Satellite. The satellite was not
inside the rocket at the launch pad when the damage occurred.
   A preliminary investigation showed that a high-pressure helium
line failed Wednesday as the system was being pressurized, said Jim
Cast, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. The line failure apparently caused two small holes
in the rocket's interstage adapter.
   The launch will be the first of a commercial Atlas, built by
General Dynamics Corp.
   General Dynamics said it is forming an investigation team to
determine the cause of the damage and to assess the launch date.
NASA and the Air Force will participate in the investigation.

   A court-appointed trustee overseeing the
sale of Jim Bakker's bankrupt empire today asked a judge to approve
a $7 million bid by a California minister for the PTL television
network.
   Morris Cerullo, head of Worldwide Evangelism Inc. of San Diego,
agreed to purchase PTL's remaining assets if he could be guaranteed
the cable network, trustee Dennis Shedd told U.S. Bankruptcy Court
Judge Thurmond Bishop.
   Cerullo, 58, an Assemblies of God pastor, has an organization
with branches in Great Britain, Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe. In
1978, he unveiled plans for a $100 million ``world outreach
center'' in San Diego, but unlike Bakker's Heritage USA complex 10
miles south of Charlotte, N.C., it never materialized.
   Earlier this month, evangelist Oral Roberts signed a $6.45
million contract that gave him the right to buy the cable network
unless someone else bid more or agreed to buy all of PTL's assets
as a package deal.
   In urging Bishop to approve the sale of the network to Cerullo,
Shedd did not mention whether Cerullo had signed a contract for
other PTL assets.
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer reported today that Cerullo signed
a $52 million contract Wednesday that included Heritage USA, PTL's
former religious theme park and retreat in Fort Mill.
   Also Wednesday, Cerullo deposited $7 million in an escrow
account for the network, said Brad Leggett, an attorney
representing Shedd.
   Shedd has said that any offer he accepts must be paid in full at
the time of the sale, not paid over time.
   It was not clear whether the reported $52 million price included
the $7 million for the television network. Shedd would not answer
questions during a recess called so he could confer with attorneys.
   Cable television's Home Box Office had asked the Bankruptcy
Court to block Shedd's deal with Roberts, because it doubted
Roberts could make the $242,000 monthly payments for the use of a
satellite HBO provides for PTL.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, three
months after Bakker resigned in the sex-and-money scandal that led
up to his 45-year federal prison term for fraud and conspiracy.
   Although the PTL network still carries other evangelists' taped
programs, Heritage USA, where Bakker had his studios and church,
has been closed since September. The 500-acre retreat near Fort
Mill also has five restaurants, a $10 million water park and two
500-room hotels, one of them unfinished. It includes about 1,700
undeveloped acres.
   Last year, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick failed to close
on a $65 million deal to buy PTL with bank financing. The lenders
wanted title insurance for Heritage USA, and Mernick could not
obtain it because of a Catawba Indian lawsuit claiming 144,000
acres of land, including the Heritage USA site, was illegally sold
to the state in 1840.

<TEXT>
   In a public relations effort gone awry, a
newspaperman who had criticized National Guard flyovers as
dangerous was invited along on a flight exercise _ and nearly was
killed in a crash that destroyed two jets.
   The two A-7 fighter jets of the South Dakota Air National Guard
collided over northwestern Iowa on Wednesday, raining debris on a
soybean field.
   Both pilots and Ward Bushee, executive editor of the Sioux Falls
(S.D.) Argus Leader, ejected. The pilots were uninjured, but Bushee
was taken by ambulance 70 miles to a Sioux Falls hospital, where he
was in fair condition.
   Bushee said that just before the planes collided ``I saw the
whites of the other pilot's eyes.''
   After the pilot of his plane hit the ejection release,
``everything came apart. It was just a ball of flame,'' Bushee said
in an account published in his newspaper.
   ``It was just a surreal scene. I was floating up in the air and
covered with fire. My first thought was, `I'll never see my wife
and kids again. This is it.'
   ``Pieces of the plane were going by. Flames were all over me. I
couldn't remember where the pull was to open the parachute but it
went open automatically. It was like one of those movies. The plane
was spiraling down below me in flames. It was completely silent.''
   Bushee, 41, had written an editorial in August criticizing
ceremonial flyovers as noisy and dangerous.
   ``Flyovers pose a risk for neighborhoods,'' he wrote. ``What if
the jet crashed?''
   The piece apparently led to an invitation to an ``orientation
flight,'' which the Air Guard offers ``to show civic leaders and
community personnel what our mission is and why there is an Air
Guard,'' said Lt. Ruth Christopherson.
   ``We've had no problems until this,'' she said.
   Bushee, 41, suffered a broken vertebra in his neck, cuts and
burns, but said he felt lucky to be alive.
   ``I've always been kind of scared of flying. I don't like to fly
that much. I think I will fly commercial, but I don't think I'll
fly in an A-7 soon,'' Bushee said. ``It's incredible we survived
it.''
   The pilots, Maj. Gregory Gore of Collierville, Tenn., and Maj.
Duncan Keirnes of Sioux Falls, were treated at a hospital in
Spencer and released, Christopherson said.
   Bushee said it was a clear, calm day and the planes were taking
part in exercises with two other A-7s.
   ``We were doing dogfights,'' Bushee said. ``One of the planes
started coming at us, and it just seemed like we couldn't get out
of the way. We seemed to be dodging into each other ... The next
thing I knew I was ejected out into the air and parachuting down.''
   The Guard was not releasing the names of the two pilots involved
in the crash. The cause of the accident is under investigation.

<TEXT>
   You've seen ``Dick Tracy: The Hype.'' Now
it's time for ``Dick Tracy: The Movie.''
   The Disney Co. screened the Warren Beatty-Madonna film for
reviewers Wednesday, climaxing months of buildup aimed at
acquainting potential patrons with the half-forgotten comic strip
and Beatty's efforts to convert it into a megahit.
   Scheduled for wide release on June 15, ``Dick Tracy'' bears
Disney's hopes for another smash like ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
The production cost was high _ estimates range from $23 million to
$30 million _ for a film with little apparent built-in appeal for
the younger crowd that is the backbone of today's film audience.
   The competition for summer tickets is fierce: ``Total Recall,''
``Days of Thunder'' and rehashes of ``Die Hard,'' ``Robocop,'' ``48
Hrs'' and ``Back To The Future.'' Against such predictable fare
``Dick Tracy'' is distinguished by its originality.
   The plot is basic comic strip: good cop vs. the bad guys. Chief
bad guy Big Boy Caprice schemes to rule the metropolis with his
band of grotesques ranging from Flattop to Pruneface. Big Boy mows
down his opposition, but his efforts to destroy Dick Tracy
repeatedly fail. Even his luscious moll, Breathless Mahoney, can't
seduce the dedicated cop.
   Forget the plot. The essence of ``Dick Tracy'' lies in
characters and style, and there it exceeds last summer's clunky,
over-produced Batman.
   The characters are outrageous and for the most part
entertaining. Dustin Hoffman does a delightful bit as the
unintelligible Mumbles. Al Pacino, in the best coverup since Albert
Finney's Hercule Poirot in ``Murder on the Orient Express,'' is
properly obnoxious as Big Boy Caprice. James Caan is wasted as the
gangster Spaldoni.
   Beatty plays Tracy straight and true blue. There's no wit to the
character and little sagacity; on a scale of 1 to 10 with Sherlock
Holmes ranked 10, Tracy ranks 3 among fictional detectives. But
Tracy's very straightness provides a solid core for the film.
   After a couple of flops, Madonna finally registers on the screen
as the oversexed Breathless. She's busty and brash with the kind of
lines (``What I'm looking for is a driver, preferably one with some
mileage.'') that Lauren Bacall used to murmur to Humphrey Bogart.
   As the orphaned Kid, the only sympathetic character, Charlie
Korso almost steals the film. Glenne Headly registers nicely in the
thankless role of Tracy's patient girlfriend, Tess Trueheart. Also
notable: Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys, Paul Sorvino as Lips Manlis,
Charles Durning as Chief Brandon, and Dick van Dyke, also
unrecognizable, as District Attorney.
   Richard Sylbert's design for ``Dick Tracy'' is self-conscious
but eye-filling. The same reds, greens, blues, etc., are everywhere
as in the Sunday comics.
   Director Beatty maintains a staccato pace punctuated by Danny
Elfman's overpowering score. In keeping with the 1930s atmosphere,
Beatty uses three extended montages to advance the plot. The few
quiet moments with Tess and Kid are welcome relief.
   Disney's Touchtone Pictures is releasing the film, originally
designed for the Walt Disney Pictures banner. The switch seems
logical, since the PG-rated film contains Madonna's sexual innuendo
and much gunfire (although no blood).
   Beatty also produced ``Dick Tracy.'' The writing passed through
several hands but the credit goes to Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.
Running time: 100 minutes.

   The field of youngsters competing in the 63rd
annual National Spelling Bee narrowed today to 65 super-spellers as
the competition became more intense and the words became harder in
the closing rounds.
   After completion of the fourth round, almost two-thirds of the
226 young spellers who had made it to the national event had been
eliminated. Ninety youths, 10 to 14 years in age, fell by the
wayside in the fourth round alone.
   They were victims of such words as ``cerebriform,''
``cambistry'' and ``consanguinity.''
   ``Take a deep breath,'' one of the judges suggested to William
Aston, 13, an eighth-grader from Jackson, Tenn., as the youngster
struggled with the word, ``hamartia.''
   He did and spelled it correctly to advance to the next round.
   Heather Ambrose, 12, of Front Royal, Va., was not as lucky. She
left the competition after failing to spell ``sayonara'' _ Japanese
for goodbye.
   About two-thirds of the 226 young spellers who entered the
national finals survived the opening rounds Wednesday and moved on
to today's competition.
   The field was expected to narrow rapidly. In early rounds
Wednesday the spellers were given words that had been included in a
study list of more than 2,000 words.
   In later rounds today, however, the words were not in the study
list.
   In Wednesday's competition, 71 of the 226 competitors fell out
of the competition after failing to spell such words as
``upeygan,'' ``ipsedixitism,'' ``quercitron'' and other words
equally challenging.
   Last year spellers went through 903 words before Scott Isaacs,
14, of Englewood, Colo., won.
   The 127 girls and 99 boys who entered this year's spelling bee
competed against nearly 9 million other students at the local level
to advance to the national contest.
   The competition, which began in 1925, is sponsored by Scripps
Howard Newspapers and 208 other daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers
in 47 states. The champion will win $5,000, a trophy cup and
special prizes from Encyclopaedia Britannica. In all there are
$26,550 in cash prizes.
   In Wednesday's competition, eight spellers were eliminated in
the first round.
   The tougher second round took 33 additional contestants,
including Erika Harrell, the only 9-year-old and the youngest
competitor this year. The fourth-grader from Muncie, Ind., stumbled
on ``soliterraneous'' _ forgetting the second ``r''.
   Thirty other contestants fell in the third round.
   The youngsters, ages 9 to 14, sat on rows of chairs on a stage
and when it was their turn walked to the microphone to be
challenged. To some the wait was worse than the word.
   ``Waiting for your number to come around'' is the hardest,
Melissa Lake, 14, an eighth grader from Denver, said between
rounds. She had just spelled correctly ``erubescent'' and survived
the third round with ``segue.''

   Germany loomed as the potential spoiler, as
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev opened
talks today gently sparring over the future of the powerful
European nation.
   Bush, in a White House arrival ceremony for the Soviet leader,
hailed the impending unification of East Germany with West Germany
as a milestone toward ``enduring cooperation in a Europe whole and
free.''
   But mindful of Gorbachev's reservations about a more powerful
neighbor, the President assured him ``we can work together at this
historic moment'' to reduce remaining East-West tensions.
   ``The trenches of the Cold War are disappearing,'' Gorbachev
said in response.
   But, in a thinly veiled reference to his concerns about German
unification and U.S. demands that the new country have NATO
membership, the Soviet leader recalled the Allies victory over
Nazism in World War II and, earlier, the defeat of Germany in World
War I.
   Gorbachev then pointedly expressed a hope that ``these horrible
wars will forever remain a thing of the past.''
   Earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that all the
Western allies _ and even some Warsaw Pact members _ agree that a
unified Germany's full membership in NATO is important to assure
European stability.
   ``So the Soviet Union is, to some extent, alone among the
nations involved in this who have a problem with it,'' Baker said
on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``So our job is to see if we can better explain it, see if we
can find other things that the Soviets can point to, to justify
Germany's membership in NATO to their domestic population.''
   There were indications the two sides may be in a mood to
compromise. U.S. officials are hinting at negotiations in the
future to scale down both the German and Soviet armies. A Soviet
official, speaking today on condition of anonymity, said the German
problem should be taken up by the 35 nations that form the European
Security Conference.
   It was not clear at the outset if the two leaders would find
ways to resolve the nettlesome issue of Germany before it obscures
the arms control agreements and other accords Bush and Gorbachev
have on their agenda.
   ``There should be no attempt to dictate a solution'' Gorbachev
said in Ottawa just before leaving Canada for his date with Bush.
   The Soviet leader has repeatedly declared, however, that the
United States should find an alternative to NATO membership for the
powerful nation that will be formed when East Germany is merged
with West Germany. But U.S. officials said there would be no
retreat from that position, nor any deal cut by Bush to scale down
the size of the new German army.
   Gorbachev's reservations are behind a Soviet slowdown in
multilateral negotiations to cut conventional forces in Europe,
including troop levels, tanks, aircraft, helicopters and other
non-nuclear weapons.
   And the issue has clouded other key issues on the summit agenda,
including a framework agreement to slash long-range nuclear
missiles, a halt in the production of chemical weapons and a
commercial pact to nearly quadruple travel between the two nations.
   Gorbachev has said time and again, as he did in Ottawa on
Wednesday, that for a united Germany to rejoin NATO in an era of
sweeping change and cooperation throughout Europe would be a Cold
War affront to the sensibilities of the Soviet people, who suffered
greater losses than any other to Nazi Germany in World War II.
Canada's prime minister, Brian Mulroney, expressed some sympathy
for that point, saying he hoped each side would explore
alternatives.
   American and Soviet representatives, for the fifth day, held a
round of talks at the State Department to try to overcome the
negotiating slump on conventional forces, and to expand on the
categories of long-range nuclear weapons to be reduced in another
treaty.
   They met for an hour and a half in the morning Wednesday, but
did not resume in the afternoon. ``Everybody would like to see
things progress, but there isn't a lot of progress,'' a U.S.
official said. ``They are waiting for the rest of the team.''
   The only evident accomplishment over the four days was an
agreement Tuesday on a definition of tanks and armored personnel
carriers. This will make it easier to reduce U.S. and Soviet
arsenals of the weapons and also to police compliance with a treaty.
   But the two leaders will issue joint statements setting goals
and calling for quick follow-up talks on future nuclear and
conventional cutbacks once a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty is
finished, U.S. officials said.
   Baker, who made arrangements to meet separately at the White
House with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said
last Thursday that Bush would press Gorbachev at the summit to
accelerate the troop reduction negotiations.
   But Gorbachev, who got the ball rolling in the first place by
volunteering to withdraw Red Army units and tanks from Eastern and
Central Europe threatened on Friday to reconsider his policies if
the Western allies kept insisting on NATO membership for Germany.
   The Soviets suffered a loss of at least 20 million people in
World War II, and with the Warsaw Pact weakening, Gorbachev is
concerned about the re-emergency of German military power.
   Administration officials said last Thursday that Bush will cut
no deal with Gorbachev to limit German troops, but he is prepared
to discuss a formula that might scale down the size of the Red Army
as well.
   But the officials said any settlement would require the
participation and consent of West Germany and the other partners in
the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany
for special limits,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
said.
   However, Bush and Gorbachev will discuss the ``general
question'' of German unification and ``we want to hear their
concerns and interests,'' Fitzwater said.
   The formula other U.S. officials said Bush was ready to take up
with Gorbachev involved a tradeoff, to be negotiated by NATO and
the Warsaw Pact in Vienna after the treaty governing U.S. and
Soviet conventional forces in Europe is completed.
   The Western allies would consider imposing limitations on the
size of the German army, but in exchange the Soviets would have to
agree to cut down the Red Army proportionally within the Soviet
Union, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   And, in a concession to Gorbachev, NATO troops would keep out of
what is now East Germany while some Red Army troops could stay
there for ``a transitional period,'' the official said.

   A wide variety of political and religious
demonstrators protested discreetly and without incident in
Lafayette Square today as President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev began summit talks across the street in the White
House.
   Two dozen Vietnamese refugees demanding democracy in their
homeland sang patriotic songs and waved the former flag of South
Vietnam. Nearby, 30 members of the ``New Testament Church'' carried
banners denouncing the summit. ``Both Communist bloc and democratic
rule are Satan's deceptions,'' read one sign.
   A self-described former Soviet political prisoner, Michail
Makarenko, was accompanied by a man wearing a gas mask and a
translator who carried signs calling for the Soviet Union to get
out of Lithuania.
   Makarenko criticized the use of poison gas to put down an
uprising in the Soviet republic of Georgia and alleged that 8,000
forced labor camps containing 14 million prisoners dot the Soviet
Union.
   Meanwhile, a half-dozen Buddhists who favor total disarmament
pounded drums as they sat cross-legged on the ground facing a small
statue of Buddha and burned incense. Across the park, the Moscow
rock group Gaza played for the second consecutive day in support of
a cure for AIDS.
   About a dozen horse-mounted police officers and nearly 100 local
and federal officers patrolled the park and adjacent streets. By
midday, there were no arrests of demonstrators.
   Trees blocked most of the view of the park from the White House
and the only electronic amplifiers were used by the rock band, so
it was unlikely that Bush and Gorbachev saw or heard any of the
colorful protests on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue.
   U.S. Park Police Sgt. Peter Gentile said about a half-dozen
organizations involving up to 2,000 people had been granted permits
to demonstrate Thursday. But Gentile estimated that only 150
protesters had shown up by mid-morning.
   Vietnamese refugee Le Tuy, a 32-year-old car restorer who
arrived in the United States in 1981, said he doubted the U.S. and
Soviet leaders would see his group's pro-democracy demonstration.
   ``We try the best we can to raise our voice, the real voice of
the Vietnamese people,'' Tuy said. ``With the help of the media, we
can carry our message to the two presidents.''
   Tuy's uncle, Nguyen Ngoc Bich, said the U.S. government still
has some sway over Vietnam's leaders.
   ``They need several things from the United States,'' said Bich,
who arrived in this country in 1975. ``They want normalization.
They want to lift the trade embargo. We think there should be quid
pro quo. We're asking for respect for human rights, for freedom to
be restored and for a return to a more democratic system of
government.''
   Many groups that reserved space for the entire week at Lafayette
Square, on the Ellipse behind the White House and at the Capitol's
reflecting pool planned to make appearances only on certain days.
   Saturday should be the biggest day for demonstrations, said Park
Police Maj. Carl Holmberg. He noted that Gorbachev and Bush plan to
spend Saturday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in the
mountains of western Maryland.
   In Lafayette Square on Wednesday, before Gorbachev's arrival
from Canada, was Concepcion Picciotto, 45, who has been there since
1981 as part of an anti-nuclear peace vigil.
   ``I want to do something for humanity,'' she said. She handed
out leaflets that read, ``Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, ever rocket fired, signifies a theft from those who are
hungry and are not fed, from those who are cold and are not
clothed.''

   Authorities investigating the killings of
three young women in five days were trying to determine Thursday if
they were linked to the apparent homicides of five prostitutes over
the past year in the Washington area.
   The latest deaths have renewed fears among prostitutes who
recall that last year's epidemic of slayings was never solved, said
Prissy Williams-Godfrey, head of a prostitution-advocacy group.
   Alexandria police officer Don Hayes said detectives are going
over the background of a woman found dead late Wednesday to find if
she was ever arrested or had any connection to the other women
killed recently.
   The woman, whose identity was withheld pending notification of
relatives, was found at the bottom of a grassy embankment. She was
partially clothed, wrapped in a plastic bag and had her hands tied.
   There was no immediate word on how or when the woman had died.
   The bodies of two other women who police said had been arrested
in the past on prostitution charges were found over the Memorial
Day weekend within a mile of each other in neighboring Arlington
County.
   ``We are working with other jurisdictions in the area trying to
cover all possibilities at this time,'' said Arlington Detective
Mike Rocconi. ``We are following several leads.''
   He said he could not comment on whether there were similarities
between the victims and the circumstances of their deaths.
   The two deaths followed five killings since April 1989 of women
authorities said had worked as prostitutes.
   Autopsies of 20-year-old Sandra R. Johnson and 26-year-old
Sherry Larman showed both women died of asphyxiation.
   Williams-Godfrey said another prostitute, whom she knew only as
Cindy, has been missing since Tuesday afternoon.

<HEAD>USDA Officials See Little Risk From Chemical, Drug Residues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Recent tests show that consumers run little
health risk from drug, chemical and pesticide residues in meat and
poultry, agriculture Department officials said Thursday.
   ``The residue rates are the lowest they've been in years,'' said
Richard L. Carnevale, assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service. He released the latest testing
results at a news briefing.
   The tests were performed on a broad range of food animals,
including cattle, calves, swine, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys
and ducks.
   Department officials acknowledged growing consumer concern about
the residues of pesticides, other farm chemicals such as
fertilizers and drugs in the food that they buy at the grocery
store.
   Such residues are found when drugs have been administered
improperly and when the animals have eaten crops sprayed with
chemicals.
   Carnevale, however, said pesticide and chemical residues were
not shown to exist in illegal levels in the most recent tests and
that only a few problems were found with drug residues. Young veal
calves were one area of concern, he said.
   Illegal levels of residues were found in only 0.3 percent of the
41,505 samples tested in the agency's routine monitoring last year,
he said.
   The Food Safety and Inspection Service conducts three types of
residue testing programs. Carnevale said the routine monitoring
system ``provides us with the most meaningful residue statistics.''
   He said the results of testing 41,000 samples showed that
statistically fewer than one out of 100 animals marketed contained
illegal residues and perhaps as few as one in 1,000.
   He did announce that as a result of the test findings producers
and others will have to present ``a full complement'' of signed
statements before so-called bob veal calves _ less than 3 weeks old
or 150 pounds _ would be accepted for slaughter.
   Carnevale said that certification program was needed because the
monitoring program found 38 instances in which calves, primarily of
the bob veal variety, contained excessive levels of sulfa and
antibiotic compounds.
   Tests also showed high levels of sulfa residues in cull dairy
cows _ ones that are no longer producing milk and are on their way
to slaughter, Carnevale said. He said the potent antibiotic
gentamicin is being used frequently in food animals, even though
that is not permitted.
   He said USDA officials are notifying dairy producers through
organizations such as the National Milk Producers Federation that
better control of the use of such drugs in cull animals is needed.
   Carnevale said the high levels of sulfa and antibiotics are
being found in the bob veal calves and cull animals because ``they
are the most susceptible to infection'' and in some cases ``the
farmer is trying to keep them alive'' and ``using everything he can
find to get them to market.''

<HEAD>After 50 Years, Circus Family May Finally be Buried</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50 years after their deaths,
circus magnate John Ringling and his wife, Mable, may be on their
way to a final resting place.
   The 2nd District Court of Appeal in Lakeland on Wednesday upheld
a judge's order last year allowing burial of the Ringlings at the
Sarasota art museum that bears their name.
   Sarasota was the winter home of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey Circus, and the Ringlings were benefactors of the museum.
Ringling died in 1936, seven years after his wife.
   ``It means we're prepared to move forward with the appropriate
memorial,'' said lawyer Lamar Matthews.
   Matthews represents Ringling's nephew Henry Ringling North in
his quest to have the couple buried at the museum alongside North's
mother, Ida North, who was Ringling's sister.
   Pat Buck, a grandniece of Ringling, had opposed burying Mrs.
North with the Ringlings because she had nothing to do with the
circus.
   Because of the dispute, Mrs. North's body has been in storage at
a Sarasota funeral home since her death in 1950.
   North had the Ringlings' bodies moved in 1987 from Fairview,
N.J., to crypts at a cemetery in nearby Port Charlotte.
   Buck and other relatives had taken the burial dispute into
court. Family discord dates back over decades.
   The state-owned museum's board of trustees voted 8-1 last year
to allow the burials on the museum grounds, provided family
differences could be worked out. Museum director Laurence Ruggiero
said he believes the appeals ruling will settle that question and
allow the burials.
   ``As soon as I get assured by our attorney that the legal stuff
is over with, we're going to proceed,'' Ruggiero said.
   Secretary of State Jim Smith, whose office oversees the museum,
also has endorsed the burials.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Seen Slumping in Latest Government Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories slumped 2.3 percent in
April, helping to push orders for the year so far down 2 percent,
the government said Thursday in a report showing further evidence of
a slow manufacturing economy.
   ``Basically, it shows the manufacturing sector is still dead in
the water,'' said Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist with the
First National Bank of Chicago. ``It's just not going anywhere.''
   The Commerce Department said orders to factories for both durable
and non-durable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted
$235.6 billion. That followed gains of 4 percent in March and 1.8
percent in February.
   Despite the gains, the April decline and a 5.5 percent drop in
January means factory orders have fallen 2 percent in the year's
first four months. And, the department said, orders have been
relatively flat since the beginning of 1989.
   The January decline was the steepest since a 7 percent plunge in
December 1974.
   Factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing
industry plans for production. A decrease in orders may forecast a
slump in that sector and layoffs in the future.
   ``The decrease in April new orders was concentrated in the
durable goods sector which declined ... 4.3 percent to $123.4
billion,'' the department said, revising the drop in durable orders
from the 4.1 percent decline first reported last week.
   ``The largest decrease was in transportation equipment, down ...
14.7 percent to $31.7 billion,'' it added. ``Both motor vehicles and
aircraft were down.'' Excluding transportation, orders were
unchanged.
   Transportation orders had risen 24.1 percent in March and 10.1
percent in February.
   Also unchanged during April were non-durable orders, which
remained at $112.2 billion.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders fell 9.8 percent to $36.9 billion
after a 13.3 percent gain the previous month. Excluding aircraft,
they were off 0.2 percent in April and 1.1 percent in March.
   Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
forecasting firm, said the capital goods spending report spells bad
news for industrial production.
   ``Businesses are starting to pull in their horns,'' Evans said,
because of high interest rates and ``a 16 percent decline in profits
last year and, in the first quarter, they're not getting any
better.''
   The volatile defense category posted a 2 percent gain to $8
billion after advances of 4.5 percent in March and 18.3 percent in
February. Excluding defense, orders fell 2.4 percent.
   Inventories ticked up 0.1 percent to $372.3 billion following two
months of declines. But Ms. Tainer said, ``They remain lean.''
   If inventories were to increase without a corresponding gain in
orders, production cutbacks could occur as factories try to get rid
of goods stored on shelves and backlots, often causing job layoffs.
   Besides transportation orders, other durable declines included
orders for non-electrical machinery, down 2.9 percent to $21.7
billion, and primary metals, down 1.4 percent to $11.6 billion.
   Electrical machinery orders rose 4 percent to $20.4 billion after
falling 1.7 percent in March and rising 2.8 percent in February.

   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev renewed ``an
old friendship'' at the White House today, sharing tea and
conversation while the Bushes' pet dog, Millie, sat at the Soviet
first lady's feet.
   There was an air of cordiality between the U.S. and Soviet
presidents' wives from the moment the Gorbachevs arrived at the
White House for the start of the four-day summit.
   After a ceremonial welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn and a
diplomatic receiving line inside the White House, Mrs. Bush took
her Soviet guest upstairs to the second-floor family quarters for
tea and a tour that included the Lincoln Bedroom.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, quoted the U.S. first
lady as saying afterward, ``We had a great meeting renewing an old
friendship.''
   ``She said Mrs. Gorbachev was very knowledgable and very warm,''
said the spokeswoman.
   ``She said that Mrs. Gorbachev and Millie bonded,'' Ms. Perez
added with a laugh. The English springer spaniel is a favorite of
many White House visitors, and is quick to warm to strangers.
   ``Millie sat on Mrs. Gorbachev's foot and she followed her ...
all over the house,'' the spokeswoman said.
   The first ladies had tea in the West Sitting Room, which
overlooks the Rose Garden and the Oval Office where President Bush
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev began summit talks.
   Mrs. Bush was quoted as observing that Mrs. Gorbachev is ``very
beautiful'' and having ``the most beautiful complexion.''
   Earlier, Mrs. Bush put a gentle hand on Mrs. Gorbachev's back
and guided her down a line of dignitaries to their appointed place
on the White House South Lawn as their husbands took center stage
for the arrival ceremony.
   The two first ladies exchanged pleasantries and an occasional
laugh, waved to familiar faces in the crowd and watched the
pageantry of unfold before them.
   The last time Mrs. Gorbachev visited Washington, in December
1987, she ruffled Nancy Reagan's feathers by observing that the
White House was more a museum than ``a regular house.''
   This time, cordiality reigned supreme.
   President Bush and his wife strolled out of the Rose Garden to
greet Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife on a
driveway lined with soldiers holding American and Soviet flags.
   Mrs. Bush wore a Bill Blass suit, with a lime-green jacket
trimmed in white over a white skirt, and her trademark triple
strand of fake pearls. Mrs. Gorbachev wore a scarlet
double-breasted jacket over a black skirt.
   Even in her black high heels, Mrs. Gorbachev was a couple of
inches shorter than Mrs. Bush, who had on white pumps.
   As they walked down a line of VIPs and shook hands with Vice
President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his
wife, Susan, and other guests, Mrs. Bush put her hand on Mrs.
Gorbachev's back, introducing her and guiding her along. Their
places were marked in white on a green runner on the lawn, a few
steps from the speaker's platform.
   During Bush's long opening remarks and Gorbachev's briefer
response, Mrs. Gorbachev stood ramrod straight, clutching a black
handbag in her right hand. Mrs. Bush, who had both hands free,
often shifted from one foot to another and occasionally checked her
watch. She led the applause when Bush said Mrs. Gorbachev's return
to the White House ``brings joy to all of our hearts.''
   The two first ladies had tea with two of Mrs. Bush's
daughters-in-law, Margaret Bush of Alexandria, Va., and Susan Bush
of Denver, as well as the the wives of Quayle, Baker, Assistant
Secretary of State Ray Seitz, Jack Matlock, the U.S. ambassador to
the Soviet Union, and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the new Soviet
ambassador to Washington.
   Later, Mrs. Gorbachev and her husband were having lunch at the
Soviet Embassy with American film stars, intellectuals and other
luminaries.
   This afternoon, while Gorbachev conferred again with Bush, Mrs.
Gorbachev planned separate visits to the Library of Congress and
the Capital Children's Museum.
   Industrialist Armand Hammer is host at a reception at the
Library of Congress in the afternoon for Mrs. Gorbachev and 350
guests, including Marilyn Quayle, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, and Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Co.
   Mrs. Gorbachev was to tour the library's Jefferson Building and
cut the ribbon on an exhibit of Russian religious manuscripts,
``Living Traditions of Russian Faith: Books and Manuscripts of the
Old Believers, Fifteenth Century to the Present.''
   Next on the schedule is the Capital Children' Museum, which is
teeming with hands-on, interactive exhibits for kids of all ages
and draws 250,000 visitors a year.
   It is currently showing the works of Anton Kumankov, a Soviet
writer-illustrator of children's books, who will be on hand to
welcome Mrs. Gorbachev.
   Later the Gorbachevs return to the White House for a formal
state dinner in their honor.
   They were last here in December 1987.
   The two first ladies will jet together to Massachusetts on
Friday morning to address the graduates at Wellesley College and
take in sights in the Boston area.
   They fly back to Washington that afternoon in time for the
Gorbachevs to host a return dinner for the Bushes at the Soviet
Embassy Friday night.
   Both first ladies will accompany their husbands to Camp David,
Md., the mountain retreat 75 miles from Washington, on Saturday for
what the White House billed as a day of relaxation.

<HEAD>CNN Book Tells All on Turner and Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Edward Turner III, a.k.a. ``Terrible
Ted,'' ``Mouth of the South'' and ``Captain Outrageous,'' is short
on words and long on bravado.
   Even when someone is writing a book about his baby, the Cable
News Network.
   ``Ted's out there,'' said author Hank Whittemore, in what may be
one of the understatements of the decade. ``He's like a brief
tornado in your life.''
   Whittemore has written ``CNN: The Inside Story,'' a 308-page
chronicle of the little network that could. Its release Friday by
Little, Brown &amp; Co., coincides with CNN's 10th birthday.
   Excerpts have appeared in TV Guide. Some of the stories in the
book have been told more times in more journalistic watering holes
than Dan Rather's infamous seven-minute stroll off a live CBS
newscast.
   Take, for example, the time a light bulb exploded in the CNN
Washington bureau and ignited the clothing of on-camera reporter Dan
Schorr. Or the time weatherman Stu Siroka was victimized by the
Chromakey process, which allows one picture to be placed behind
another. All viewers saw was Siroka's bald head, suspended above the
weather map.
   Take Turner, who after agreeing to cooperate with Whittemore,
would walk in to scheduled interviews and say ``Hi, Hank, how much
time you want? I've got about nine minutes.''
   Whittemore spent six months interviewing present and former CNN
movers and shakers. His account tells a spirited and sometimes
bizarre tale of how Turner, equipped with $100 million and even more
chutzpah, screamed, bullied, sued, cajoled and bankrolled his way
into television history by launching the first 24-hour all-news
network.
   On cable.
   And here is Whittemore, the author a best seller called ``The
Super Cops,'' magazine articles and television documentaries, on a
nationwide tour to promote his book and calling from a pay phone in
Washington's National airport.
   Asked to explain Turner, Whittemore pauses. There was an awards
dinner in Kansas City that Whittemore attended recently. ``Now I'm
still working on the book,'' Whittemore recounted, ``and he comes up
to me and says `What are you going to write about me? Just don't
make me out to be an ass.'
   ``Then he looks around and kind of beams, and says `Well, maybe I
was.'
   ``I felt like I was in a Harold Robbins novel,'' Whittemore says,
and laughs.
   ``The man will say the most outrageous things and you wonder `Is
the man just not thinking or is he being very calculating?' ''
   Whittemore talked not only to Turner. He spent hours with Ted
Kavanau, an early CNN executive who became president of Headline
News only to be forced out, and Reese Schonfeld, the network's
founding president, who also left, as well as former anchor Mary
Alice Williams, now with NBC, and several others.
   ``CNN: The Inside Story'' begins in a dilapidated white clapboard
house that was the network's first home and ends in the megalomaniac
structure in Atlanta that now houses the international news agency.
   It copiously notes many weird tales of the upstart network, from
the early days when work crews were literally finishing the set as
anchor Bernard Shaw read the news.
   And the time a cleaning woman, not knowing Shaw was on live,
walked right up to his desk and emptied his trash basket, and the
time a reporter said that ``Mary Ass Williams'' was standing by, and
yet another instance when a correspondent reported that scientists
were trying to grow ``genetically engineered orgasms'' in the
laboratory.
   But gaffes are not the only events noted. Loud and clear,
Whittemore's book comes through with the underlying theme that CNN
made television history by making the Big Three sit up and take
notice.
   And by making CBS, NBC and ABC reluctantly admit they were no
longer the only games in town.
   Round-the-clock news coverage gave CNN a number of firsts:
   President Reagan walking into a Washington, D.C., hospital after
being shot; a split-screen of the hostages being released in Iran as
Reagan was sworn into office, and a lonely cameraman perched atop a
cherry-picker with the only live feed of a nuclear warhead being
removed after an Air Force explosion in Arkansas.
   ``It seems to me that what they want to do is wire the entire
world,'' Whittemore said. ``They want to be totally global, in terms
of sending and receiving signals so that you get what Turner calls
the world talking to itself.''

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old charged in the Central Park
``wilding'' case pleaded guilty to assault today in connection with
an attack on a male jogger the same night a female jogger was
nearly killed.
   The defendant, Michael Briscoe, had not been charged in the
infamous April 19, 1989, gang rape and beating attack on the woman
investment banker, who was left for dead.
   Briscoe pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree assault,
the top count in his indictment, before state Supreme Court Justice
Thomas Galligan. The charge related to an attack by a gang of
youths on David Lewis, 31, a banker who was jogging in the park the
same night the woman was attackes.
   Galligan sentenced Briscoe to one year in prison in connection
with the assault on Lewis. He could have been sentenced to seven
years in prison on the second-degree assault charge.
   At the same time, Galligan sentenced him to one year for his
guilty plea of May 7 to a charge of fifth-degree criminal sale of a
controlled substance. That charge related to Briscoe's selling a
small quantity of PCP, or ``angel dust,'' to an undercover police
officer on March 4.
   Galligan ordered the sentences to run concurrently.
   Briscoe was one of eight teen-agers indicted in the assault on
Lewis. Another of the defendants, Jermain Robinson, pleaded guilty
to first-degree robbery in connection with the attack on Lewis and
on another man jogging in the park, teacher John Loughlin.
   The other six defendants await trial in connection with attacks
on Lewis and Loughlin as well as the rape and attempted murder of
the woman jogger, a 29-year-old woman.
   The woman was attacked as she jogged on a park roadway and was
left for dead in a muddy gully. She has since recovered remarkably
from her physical injuries, doctors say, and has returned to work
at Salomon Bros., where she is a vice president.
   Jury selection for the trial of three of the defendants is
scheduled to begin June 13.
   Briscoe's lawyer, Joseph Klempner, said that as a condition of
the plea, Briscoe must continue to talk to the prosecution about
the Central Park case. But Klempner said he would be surprised if
Briscoe ended up testifying and added, ``there's no deal here.''

<TEXT>
   A military court Wednesday suspended the
trial of Nicu Ceausescu, son of deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
until June 25 for further evidence and testimony from new witnesses.
   Nicu Ceausescu is charged with complicity in ``genocide'' for
allegedly ordering security forces to fire on demonstrators during
the December revolution that ended his father's 24-year
dictatorship. At the time, Nicu Ceausesc was the Communist Party
secretary of Sibiu County in central Romania.
   He pleaded innocent to the genocide charge but has pleaded guilty
to a lesser charge of illegal possession of arms and ammunition.
   Witnesses have testified that Ceausescu only ordered troops to
open fire when he was drunk.
   Maj. Dorel Ursu, president of the five-judge panel, agreed to
allow 19 new witnesses to be called, including 10 civilians wounded
in the revolution.
   He also agreed to a prosecution request to call Mirela Cosa, a
girlfriend of Nicu Ceausescu who was in contact with him during the
height of the revolution.
   During the trial, Ceausescu has been allowed to sit in the dock
because he is still recovering from a stab wound inflicted Dec. 22,
the day he was captured and his parents overthrown. The ousted
dictator and his wife were executed Dec. 25.

   A strong aftershock jolted Romania and
Bulgaria early today, sending panicked people back into the streets
and damaging more buildings a day after a major earthquake killed
at least 13 people.
   The aftershock struck at 3:18 a.m. and was the strongest of
about 100 recorded after Wednesday's quake, which was felt from
Moscow to Istanbul and caused major damage to buildings in Romania
and Bulgaria, officials said.
   Romania's Ministry of Health reported today that nine people
were killed in Wednesday's quake and 994 people sought hospital
treatment. A ministry communique carried by Radio Bucharest said
207 people were hospitalized. The temblor also killed one person in
Bulgaria and three in the Soviet Union.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties today.
   The Bulgarian news agency BTA said that, like Wednesday's quake,
today's aftershock was centered in the Carpathian Mountain region
of Vrancea in northern Romania.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
measured Wednesday's quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale of ground
motion and today's main aftershock at 5.9.
   A strong earthquake also struck near Mexico City today,
frightening residents but apparently causing no serious damage or
injuries. The quake registered 6.1 on the Richter scale.
   Damage from the aftershock appeared most serious in Vrancea
County, 190 miles northeast of Bucharest, where the state news
agency Rompress reported ``panic and a large amount of material
damage.''
   Severely damaged were the mayor's house, a theater, a medical
center, the national bank and a building with 60 apartments in the
county capital of Focsani, it said.
   In northern Bulgaria, thousands of people frightened by the
aftershock reportedly spent the night in the street, or fled their
cities.
   Cities and villages on the Danube river, including Ruse,
Silistra and Svishtov ``were panic stricken,'' BTA said.
   It said thousands of people milled around city streets all
night, or fled in their cars. The city of Silistra has appealed for
aid, saying it urgently needed glass, cement, bricks and tiles to
repair damaged homes, schools, kindergartens and the lone hospital,
the agency said.
   In Bucharest, people fled into the streets and stood in small
groups under dim lights. In the Bucharest Hotel, about a dozen
people remained in the lobby, frightened to go upstairs.
   Dumitru Enescu, director of Romania's Earth Physics Institute,
told Rompres that 100 aftershocks were recorded in the first 26
hours after Wednesday's quake. Prof. Stefan Tataru, chief of a
seismic station in Vrancea County, told Rompres that about 10 of
the aftershocks registered between 3 and 4 on the Richter Scale and
the rest were of lower intensity.
   Damage reports from Wednesday's quake continued to filter into
the capital. In Urziceni, 38 miles east of Bucharest, the roof of a
technical-medical store collapsed, destroying the building. Nobody
was injured.
   In the capital Wednesday, chunks of concrete from high-rise
buildings crashed to the ground, crushing two people to death.
Ceilings fell, walls cracked, books toppled from shelves, and tens
of thousands of people rushed into the streets, many crying and
screaming in fear.
   Romanians leaped in panic from windows and balconies, and some
were badly hurt, ambulance officials said.
   The quake hit when Bucharest's streets were crowded with
lunch-hour shoppers and pedestrians. It lasted about 45 seconds and
was the third major earthquake since 1977 with its epicenter in the
Romanian Carpathians.
   The Uppsala Seismological Center in Sweden said it was felt so
widely because it was about 63 miles deep.
   ``I think it was this deafening sound of cracking walls that
scared people,'' said clerical worker Sica Burcea, 52. ``The
building was swinging horizontally and vertically. We were lucky
only to have some cracks in the walls. I shivered when I realized
1977 was coming back.''
   More than 1,500 Romanians died in a 1977 earthquake.
   In the Soviet republic of Moldavia, which borders Romania, the
quake left three people dead and six hospitalized but caused little
structural damage, the chairman of the national legislature said
today.
   Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov said in Moscow that one
person died in Moldavia after jumping out a second-floor window and
two elderly people died of heart attacks, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   BTA said one person died in Silistra of a quake-induced heart
attack.
   A communique from Romania's General Inspectorate of Police said
two people died in Bucharest, two in the Danube River port of
Braila, and one each in eastern Buzau, southeastern Ialomita,
central Brasov and nearby Prahova County.
   Food shop clerk Petruta Lungu was killed in Bucharest when she
ran outside and was hit by bricks and concrete falling from an
upstairs wall, police said. A man's body was pulled from rubble
outside the shop.
   The inspectorate reported 296 people injured, 45 critically. It
said 35 of the critically injured were in Bucharest, where 102
people were hurt.
   In Moscow, where the quake shook buildings, Soviet officials
said it was felt from the Crimea to the Baltics and damaged dozens
of buildings in the southwest. Telephone lines were knocked out and
buildings shook in at least four Soviet republics.
   In Istanbul, the Anatolia News Agency said tremors were felt in
eastern Thrace in Turkey and elsewhere around the Marmara Sea
region.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measured by the ground motion recorded by seismographs. A
quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. One of magnitude 7 is
reckoned as a major earthquake.

   A defunct storage company and its former
president have been charged with conspiracy to illegally dispose of
hazardous wastes, including surplus napalm bombs, near people's
homes, officials said today.
   ``This case represents perhaps the most serious type of
environmental misconduct,'' U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said at a news conference.
   He said that the 12-count federal grand jury indictment was the
first federal felony prosecution of environmental crime in Utah.
The company, EKOTEK, and its officers had ``duped environmentally
conscious businesses into believing that waste materials were being
properly disposed of,'' Thornburgh said.
   The indictment alleges the company knowingly burned, poured out
and improperly stored a variety of hazardous wastes in violation of
an array of state and federal laws in the middle and late 1980s.
The site is now on the Superfund cleanup list.
   Among the incidents leading to the indictment was that of a
17-year-old boy who reported that his shoe began to bubble and
disintegrate after he accidentally stepped in some liquid while
running near the site, officials said. Tests have been conducted
around 125 homes near the site.
   The charges were filed Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District
Court.
   Named in the indictment were EKOTEK and Steven M. Self, the
company's president. The company was involuntarily dissolved Nov. 1.
   If convicted on all charges, Self could face a prison term of up
to 45 years, and he and the company would face up to $24 million in
fine.
   Company vice president Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday
to felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal resource
conservation and recovery laws and the Clean Water Act, Thornburgh
said.
   Miller was allowed to plead guilty in exchange for his
cooperation in the prosecution of Self, authorities said. He could
face up to 13 years in prison and a $750,000 fine; sentencing was
set for July 10.
   Self and his company are alleged to have purchased millions of
gallons of oil and solvents and burned them as fuel in a refinery
in northern Salt Lake City about three miles northwest of the
downtown area. The burning violated the federal Clean Air Act. In
other cases, wastes were illegally poured into storm drains or
stored in an improper manner.
   State Department of Health officials said tens of thousands of
gallons of the wastes have leaked into the ground and contaminated
nearby homes.
   In addition, the indictment alleges that in July 1986, Self
arranged to accept two napalm bombs for ``testing, storage and
treatment'' from the Navy Weapons Support Center in Fallbrook,
Calif. State explosives experts had to haul the bombs away and
dispose of them in 1987.
   The site, currently being cleaned up through the Environmental
Protection Agency's Superfund program, reportedly still contains
almost a half million gallons of used petroleum products and other
toxic wastes in leaking tanks and drums.
   Among the chemicals found at the plant were poisonous
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs; methylene chloride, which has
been linked to tumors; and the toxic solvents n-butyl acetate,
methyl ethyl ketone, toluene and xylene.
   The site was identified for EPA cleanup in 1988. The agency has
identified 32 companies as being responsible for cleanup of
approximately 500,000 gallons of aging, used petroleum products and
other hazardous wastes at the site.
   EKOTEK-Petrochem formerly operated an oil refinery on the site.
The state Division of Environmental Health had determined it might
pose a risk to nearby residents and the EPA took soil samples from
land surrounding about 125 homes earlier this year.

<HEAD>Company Agrees To Replace Water Coolers With Lead Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools and other owners of old water coolers
that put too much lead into drinking water can receive free
replacements under a final agreement announced Thursday by the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Under terms of the consent agreement, the Halsey Taylor Division
of Scotsman Group Inc. will mail notices of the replacement offer to
public and private school officials; universities and colleges; day
care centers with enrollments of 10 or more; and headquarters for
the YMCA, the YWCA and boys and girls clubs.
   It also will run advertisements in trade journals aimed at public
building managers.
   The offer to provide either a replacement cooler or a cash refund
_ at the option of the cooler owner _ applies to any Halsey Taylor
model made prior to 1979 that tests show emits excessive amounts of
lead _ more than 20 parts per billion _ into the water passing
through it.
   Halsey Taylor models made since 1979 do not have internal water
storage tanks and are not under suspicion. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission maintains that a lead-dip used on the exterior of
some pre-1979 models to help attach cooling coils to the tank
resulted in lead migrating to the inside of the tank and into the
stored water.
   The Vernon Hills, Ill., company denied that any of its products
constituted a health risk, but said in a statement signed on April 2
by Scotsman Group President Richard C. Osborne that it was agreeing
to the replacement program ``for the purpose of resolving this
matter without resorting to protracted administrative and judicial
proceedings.''
   At a news conference to publicize the replacement program,
commission officials said they could not estimate how many of the
thousands of pre-1979 Halsey Taylor water coolers might dispense
water with unacceptably high lead levels, and that the only way to
be sure is to test each cooler.
   One complication is that such lead levels could be in the water
before it reached the cooler.
   Michael Cooke, head of the Environmental Protection Agency's
drinking water office, said thousands of EPA tests at schools have
disclosed unacceptably high lead levels at 10 percent to 20 percent
of ``outlets'' tested. However, outlets are not limited to water
coolers. They also include bathroom and kitchen sinks and uncooled
water fountains.
   The company has established a toll-free number to provide further
information _ 1-800-635-2358 _ and has designated a special mailing
address: Halsey Taylor Water Cooler Program, 775 Corporate Woods
Parkway, Vernon Hills, Ill., 60061.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says He'll Put Aside Differences With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian
Federation and a leading critic of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said
Thursday he will try to make peace in his personal feud with the
Soviet president.
   Yeltsin, a radical reformer, was quoted by the official Tass news
agency as saying he would put aside personal differences with
Gorbachev when the president returns from the Washington summit.
   Yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the
republic's Congress about his stormy relationship with Gorbachev,
his former mentor.
   In his new position as president of Russia, the largest Soviet
republic, Yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge
and criticize Gorbachev, who opposed his election.
   Deputies speaking Thursday at the Russian Congress ``expressed
concern over the exchange of statements about each other'' by
Yeltsin and Gorbachev, Tass reported.
   Yeltsin answered that after Gorbachev returns June 4 from the
summit in Washington, ``I think we'll have an appropriate
conversation, and we'll resolve most issues without damaging the
sovereignty and aims of Russia,'' Tass said.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Yeltsin called for achieving
Russian ``sovereignty'' within 100 days. The term is used here to
mean not independence, but autonomy in most internal decisions.
   Yeltsin also urged the Kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to
enjoy the same autonomy, making the country a federation of states
that could overrule the central government on most matters.
   Although Yeltsin said he wanted a ``businesslike'' relationship
with Gorbachev, he also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev
to give up one of his posts: either Soviet president or Communist
Party general secretary.
   ``I am against combining any post in one person. And I am talking
not just about the chairmanship of the party at the Russian level,
at the regional level, or at the local level,'' he said.
   In Ottawa on Tuesday, Gorbachev said he was ``somewhat
concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory and feared that if Yeltsin ``is
playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time.''
   There have been no reports that Gorbachev sent congratulations to
Yeltsin on his election.
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist
Party but fired him in 1987 after Yeltsin publicly criticized the
pace of reform. Relations have been strained ever since.
   Yeltsin capped a remarkable political comeback by winning
election Tuesday as Russian president.
   However, at Thursday's session of the Russian Congress, Deputy
Ivan Galushko from the Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far
East said Yeltsin was overstepping his authority with some of his
statements the day before.
   He called on Yeltsin ``to refrain from hasty statements on
questions that are within the competence of the Congress or Supreme
Soviet.''
   Tass said many deputies seconded Galushko's opinion.
   In his reply, Yeltsin acknowledged disagreements with Gorbachev
but said he would put them aside.
   ``True, we have our differences,'' said Yeltsin. ``I renounce all
these personal aspects fully and completely. I leave that behind.''
   A deputy of the national Supreme Soviet legislature, Anatoly
Denisov, said in an interview that the differences between Yeltsin
and Gorbachev are so pronounced they portend ``very bad
consequences'' and ``difficult conflicts'' for the nation.
   He said they could lead to the imposition of Soviet presidential
rule nationwide.

   Two dozen Vietnamese refugees waved the former
South Vietnamese flag and sang patriotic songs as they urged
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday to
push for democracy in their homeland.
   They were but one of many ethnic, political and religious groups
trying to send a message across Pennsylvania Avenue to the
superpower leaders meeting in the White House.
   At the height, there were some 400 people massed in Lafayette
Park, according to Maj. Carl Holmberg of the U.S. Park Police. He
said there were no arrests by early afternoon.
   The orderly protesters included a self-described former Soviet
political prisoner, a half-dozen Koreans and the same number of
Buddhists and about 75 Cubans who were moved to the Ellipse behind
the White House. Also gathered there were some 30 members of the New
Testament Church, Afghans who want the Soviet Union to stop
supporting the government there, and a Moscow rock band that wants
the two nations to cure AIDS, not build more missiles.
   Police presence was heavy. About a dozen horse-mounted officers
plus close to 100 local and federal officers patrolled the park and
kept demonstrators and pedestrians away from Pennsylvania Avenue
when Gorbachev was inside the White House.
   Trees block most of the view between the park and the White
House, and the only electronic amplification was used by the rock
group, so it was unlikely Gorbachev or Bush heard or saw any of the
colorful protests.
   Holmberg predicted that Saturday would be the biggest day for
demonstrations, even though Bush and Gorbachev are scheduled to be
out of town then at Camp David, the president retreat in Maryland.
   Vietnamese refugee Le Tuy, who arrived here in 1981, said he
expected the U.S. and Soviet leaders would not see his group's signs
or hear its songs. But he said, ``With the help of the media, we can
carry our message to the two presidents.''
   Tuy's uncle, Nguyen Ngoc Bich, contended that despite the Vietnam
War, the U.S. government still has some sway over the current
leaders in Vietnam.
   ``They need several things from the United States,'' said Bich,
who arrived here in 1975. ``They want normalization. They want to
lift the trade embargo. We think there should be quid pro quo. We're
asking for respect for human rights, for freedom to be restored and
for a return to a more democratic system of government.''

<TEXT>
   A former mental patient who once tried to
hijack a plane killed his 75-year-old father, took a woman hostage
at an eye clinic and cut his own throat before police captured him,
authorities said.
   Ralph Adolphys Hughes, 38, was in stable condition at a Tyler
hospital Thursday with a self-inflicted knife wound to his throat
and two police gunshot wounds to the leg, authorities said.
   ``The tactical officers fired two shots when they went in, but
none were life-threatening,'' said Lt. Robin Roberts. ``He did cut
his throat. He cut a fairly good gash but nothing life-threatening.''
   The woman Hughes held hostage for 3{ hours Wednesday wasn't
injured.
   Police found the body of Hughes' father, Leon, in the vehicle the
younger Hughes drove to the DeHaven Eye Associates Clinic, where
Barbara Shamburger was taken hostage.
   ``Right now, it looks like they had some kind of argument in the
car,'' said Tom Giorgio, a police spokesman.
   ``He said God made him do it. That's what he told his mother on
the phone,'' Justice of the Peace Bill Beaird said.
   He said an autopsy showed the elder Hughes died of two stab
wounds to the heart.
   Investigators filed murder, aggravated assault and aggravated
kidnapping charges against Hughes. Beaird recommended that Hughes be
held in lieu of $1 million bond when he is arraigned.
   In 1987, Hughes was acquitted of an air piracy charge by reason
of insanity. He was accused of holding a flight attendant at
knifepoint moments before a plane carrying 200 people landed at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Feb. 5, 1986. No one was
harmed.
   Defense attorney R.H. Wallace said at the time that Hughes had
regained his sanity and would be all right, ``as long as he's on
medication.''
   Police said Hughes appeared Wednesday at television station KLTV
brandishing a knife. He was covered with blood and demanded to be
allowed on the air. He left after station employees called police,
said Giorgio.
   Shortly after that, Hughes entered the eye clinic, said Donna
Rayborn, the clinic's manager of administrative services. Ms.
Rayborn said the clinic employs about 60 people and had about 10
patients inside at the time.
   Detectives had not determined a reason for Hughes' behavior,
Giorgio said.
   ``We tried to negotiate with him,'' Giorgio said. ``They waited
as long as they could, but about 3{ hours into it they decided the
negotiations were going nowhere and they went in.''
   Police knocked out a window at the clinic and threw in a stun
grenade before rescuing Mrs. Shamburger.
   Psychiatrists who treated Hughes after the plane incident said he
was schizophrenic and unable to distinguish friends from enemies.
   During the hijacking attempt, authorities said, Hughes demanded
protection for himself and his family from mob killers who he
believed were on the plane. He said killers were after him because
of a romantic relationship he had with the girlfriend of a narcotics
kingpin.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers on Thursday repealed a
40-year-old law giving East German resettlers special benefits, and
they tightened rules on ethnic Germans emigrating from elsewhere in
Eastern Europe.
   The decision to repeal the law on resettlers is expected to gain
automatic approval of the Bundesrat, or upper house of parliament.
   The effective date for repealing the law is July 1, one day
before monetary, social and economic union of the two Germanys is to
take effect.
   The law provided special benefits, including housing and
financial assistance, for East German resettlers to West Germany and
granted them automatic West German citizenship.
   Repealing the law means that East Germans will be treated exactly
like West Germans who decide to move to other parts of the country.
   More than 500,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany
since January 1989.
   The influx last fall brought on the downfall of the hard-line
East German Communist government and led to the country's first free
elections in March.
   But East Germans continued to flood into West Germany, straining
West Germany's already tight housing and social services.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government resisted cutting the
resettlers' benefits until the monetary union takes effect.
   In addition to the East Germans, some 175,000 ethnic Germans from
other East European countries have arrived in West Germany this year.
   The legislators Thursday tightened requirements for ethnic
Germans emirgating from East Europe. They must now apply at West
German embassies to be recognized as ethnic Germans in their
homelands before they are granted permission to immigrate to West
Germany.
   In the past, the emigres could arrive in West Germany and then
apply to be recognized as ethnic Germans.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, hosting a luncheon for
American thinkers and performers, said today he needs time to
accomplish radical economic reforms in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, tossed a lunch party for some of
America's best-known personalities including actress and aerobics
guru Jane Fonda, actor Gregory Peck, writer Ray Bradbury and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Jesse Jackson was the only
politician on the guest list.
   In his remarks, Gorbachev appealed for more cooperation between
the Americans and the Soviets, and told his guests that, like a
pregnant woman, his country needs at least nine months to give birth
to economic reforms.
   ``We need time,'' he said to his guests who were seated at
crystal-laden tables underneat chandeliers in an ornate reception
room at the Soviet Embassy. The Gorbachevs are staying at the
building about six blocks from the White House.
   Others on the guest list included Robert Redford, Burt Lancaster,
Frank Sinatra, Jack Lemmon, Dizzy Gillespie and Van Cliburn, J.
Carter Brown, director of the National GIt said the main reason was an
upswing in fruit and vegetable
imports from Latin America in the wake of December's freeze in
Florida and Texas.
   The department forecast the U.S. agricultural surplus for the
year at $18 billion, only a shade below that for fiscal 1989.
   The surplus had been rising steadily since fiscal 1986 when it
skidded to an anemic $5.4 billion. In terms of volume, the estimate
of $150 million tons is up from last year's total of $146.4 million.
   The forecast puts exports of grains and feeds at $16.3 billion,
wheat and flour at $5.1 billion, rice at $800 million, coarse grains
overall at $7.9 billion and corn at $6.9 billion.
   It estimates total exports of oilseeds and their products at $5.9
billion, with soybeans at $3.7 billion, soybean cake and meal $900
million and soybean oil at $400 million.
   The forecast was for livestock products of $5.5 billion, poultry
and products $800 million, dairy products $400 million,
horticultural products $5 billion, tobacco $1.3 billion, cotton and
linters $2.9 billion, seeds $600 million and sugar and tropical
products $1.4 billion.

   USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service is
proposing to lower from 25 percent to 22 percent the limit on fat in
ground beef under its institutional meat purchase specifications
used by schools, hospitals and the armed services.
   The change would be part of a broader revision of the
institutional meat specifications, the department announced. It said
the move was designed to reflect increased consumer interest in
lower-fat beef.
   ``Its a step in the right direction,'' said Bonnie Liebman,
director of nutrition for the Washington-based Center for Science in
the Public Interest. ``They could do more.''
   Currently, USDA defines lean beef as having no more than 10
percent fat by weight but makes an exception for ground beef and
puts its level at 22.5 percent. ``That's why I like to speak of
so-called lean ground beef,'' Liebman said. Regular ground beef can
range up to 30 percent fat by weight.
   Under the institutional purchase specifications, the limit
applies only if the buyer does not negotiate to obtain the beef at a
different level of fat.

   USDA is cosponsoring a National Sustainable
Agriculture and Natural Resources Conference on Aug. 15-18 in
Lincoln, Neb.
   Sustainable agriculture refers to growing techniques that reduce
reliance on pesticides and other chemicals that have been shown to
pose health risks.
   ``The conference is designed to achieve a profitable agriculture
that is environmentally sound, resource efficient, socially
acceptable and thus sustainable in the future,'' said Charles E.
Hess, assistant secretary of agriculture for science and education.
   The conference will bring together educators, government
officials, farmers, agribusiness executives and environmentalists,
USDA said. It said they would ``develop guidelines to form state
teams to implement programs for sustainable agriculture throughout
the nation.''
   Other sponsors include the Rodale Institute, Dupont Co., the
American Forestry Association and the Wildlife Management Institute.

<HEAD>``Mad Cow'' Disease Turns Into French-English Beef</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British ``mad cow'' disease has now made Britain
mad at France, which rejected demands Thursday that it lift its ban
on imports of beef from across the Channel.
   British officials were irate when France imposed the temporary
ban on British beef Wednesday. The French say the beef may be
tainted by bovine spongiform encephalitis, the nervous disorder
known as ``mad cow'' disease.
   Taking up Britain's cause, the European Community on Thursday
criticized the French action and demanded the ban be lifted.
   But French Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet said the ban will
stay in place at least until the return this weekend of a team of
French veterinarians sent to Britain to assess the disease.
   Nallet acknowledged that his ``difficult decision'' had been
denounced abroad but said he acted to avert ``worry and panic''
among French consumers.
   France buys more than half of Britain's beef exports, by far the
biggest market. British officials accused France of using the
disease as an excuse to protect France's domestic market.
   ``They ought to lift that ban straightaway,'' said Francis Maud,
British minister of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
   ``British beef is perfectly safe. All the scientific evidence
points in that direction. This French ban is unjustified and clearly
in breach of Community Law, and as good Europeans we find that
intolerable.''
   Other Western European countries have banned imports of cattle
from Britain, but they have not banned beef imports.
   Two associations representing the French beef industry praised
the ban, saying their profits were being hurt by a flood of
low-priced beef imports after British customers began shying away
from the product.
   Not all the French took the ban seriously. Jacques Cagna, a
well-known Paris chef, posed for a photograph in his restaurant
holding a platter of British beef, which he vowed to serve to his
patrons.
   The cause of the disease is not known. Because the symptoms are
similar to scrapie, a sheep disease, it is assumed the disease was
transmitted through cattle feeds. They use sheep offal as a protein
supplement.
   The British government is sponsoring research on the disease,
which was identified in Britain in 1986. The outbreak has largely
been confined there.
   The disease, which has killed 13,648 cows in Britain, eats holes
in the brains of infected cattle and makes their tissue spongy.
British officials say there is no indication the disease can be
transmitted to humans, but beef sales have dropped sharply in
Britain.
   The European Community Commission, in its statement Thursday,
said it ``regrets ... the action of the French authorities, taken
without prior consultation.''
   EC Agricultural Commissioner Ray McSharry said there was
``absolutely no justification'' for France's action.

   Lower prices and higher consumer incomes
boosted the typical American family's ability to buy an existing
single-family home in April, a real estate trade group said Thursday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its housing
affordability index reached 104.6 in April, up from 103.9 in March.
   That means a family earning the median income of $34,032 had
104.6 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional
financing covering 80 percent of a median-priced home costing
$95,300.
   The median income means half the families earned more and half
less. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   The median price of a home in April declined $1,000 from March,
meaning the income needed to qualify for a loan dropped $96 to
$32,544. At the same time, the median family income rose $108.
   Realtors president Norman D. Flynn said the typical price of an
existing home in many cities is below the national median.
   The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that the median
price of a new home was $135,900 in April, but analysts generally
agreed that reflected a big jump in new home sales in the expensive
Northeastern market that month. The median had been $119,400 in
March.
   The housing affordability index would have been higher in April,
the Realtors said, except for an increase in the interest rate used
to compute the index from 10.07 percent in March to 10.15 percent in
April.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index is a composite of
closing rates offered for both fixed-rate mortgages and
adjustable-rate mortgages for existing homes as reported by the
Federal Housing Finance Board.
   ``We do expect a gradual decline in rates in the third quarter to
stimulate a healthy home buying season this summer,'' said John A.
Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist.
   The Realtors said the changes in the index _ home price, mortgage
rate and income _ resulted in a $2 decrease in monthly mortgage
payments to $678.
   Under April's affordability conditions, the Realtors said, a
family earning $20,000 would qualify for a $58,500 home using a
$46,800 loan. A family earning $30,000 would qualify for a $87,500
home with a $70,200 loan. A family earning $40,000 would qualify for
a $117,000 home with a $93,600 loan, and a family with $50,000
income would qualify for a $146,300 home with a $117,000 loan.
   But Flynn noted buyers may still face a major hurdle in obtaining
down payments even with incomes sufficient to qualify for loans.

   Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos
collapsed at the defense table during her fraud trial today, her
mouth and nose bleeding, and was admitted to a hospital.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, uttered a faint cry before she slumped forward,
and attorneys and family members rushed to her aid. She was taken,
apparently unconscious, to a nurses station in the federal
courthouse, and then by ambulance to New York Hospital.
   Dr. David Case, who has been treating Mrs. Marcos for high blood
pressure, said at midafternoon that tests were under way on Mrs.
Marcos' digestive system to determine what was wrong. Her condition
is stable and she will be admitted to the hospital, he said.
   Asked whether the condition she suffered today could be
stress-related, he said, ``It could be.'' Asked if it was
life-threatening, he said, ``Not at the moment.''
   He said he doesn't think the problem is related to high blood
pressure.
   ``I think the agony of a lengthy, drawn-out trial is taking its
toll on her as it has on all of us,'' said Benjamin Cassiday, one of
Mrs. Marcos' lawyers.
   It was the third time in the past month _ and the most serious _
that Mrs. Marcos became ill in court, prompting the judge to call a
recess.
   The incident occurred just as another of Mrs. Marcos' attorneys,
Gerry Spence, completed his cross-examination of a witness.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ordered the courtroom cleared
after several minutes of confusion.
   Spence said later Keenan had offered to recess the trial earlier
in the day when informed that Mrs. Marcos was feeling ill, but that
Mrs. Marcos ``wanted to continue. She didn't want the trial
recessed.''
   According to James Linn, attorney for Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant,
Adnan Khashoggi, Mrs. Marcos hemorrhaged from her nose and mouth as
she fell forward and clutched her left hand to the side of her head.
   ``It was terrible,'' said Khashoggi. ``I never saw so much blood
come out of someone.''
   Linn, who was sitting with his client about eight feet from Mrs.
Marcos, said she appeared to have fainted. Others said she
apparently was not fully conscious as she was taken from the
courtroom.
   Keenan recessed the trial until Tuesday.
   As on previous occasions, the illness occurred as testimony
involving her family was being heard. The witness, Robert Shaheen,
had just finished telling about dealings between Mrs. Marcos and her
husband, the late President Ferdinand Marcos, and Khashoggi.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of having helped her late husband steal
more than $220 million from their country's treasury. He was deposed
as Philippine leader in 1986, at which time the couple moved to
Hawaii.
   Khashoggi is charged with fraud and obstructing justice for
allegedly faking documents to show that he owned real estate and
artwork of the Marcoses'.
   The trial began in late March.

<TEXT>
   East German lawmakers Thursday gave the
government broad powers to seize land, houses and businesses
controlled by the privileged elite of the old Communist regime.
   The action freezes the party's vast holdings _ amassed after it
came to power after World War II _ just four weeks before the nation
merges its economy with West Germany's and begins shifting state
property to the private sector.
   Lawmakers also voted to remove the old Communist insignia, a
hammer and drafting compass, from state buildings.
   The government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere had asked
Parliament to let him form a commission that would have the power to
wrest away the holdings of the many organizations that existed under
the former government.
   De Maiziere is to form the commission in the coming days, after
which all land, buildings and enterprises owned by the Communists
would be held in trust pending an investigation of their value and
legitimacy.
   The new law also gives the commission power to interrogate
witnesses, search houses and seize evidence during its investigation.
   The law calls for a system to be set up under which the
government could reclaim the property in the public interest, even
if the property is in other countries.
   The proposal came as the young democratic government grapples
with the monumental task of converting state-owned property to
private ownership, a prerequisite to unification with West Germany.
   The German states are to merge their economies and social
institutions on July 2, when West German currency will become the
currency of East Germany.
   The independent property commission is to report its findings to
Parliament just two days before the economic union becomes official.
   Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, leader of the reconstituted Communist Party
that now supports a form of democratic socialism, sharply criticized
the proposal during a bitter nine-hour Parliament session.
   ``They want all opposition eliminated,'' said Gysi, whose party
is now called the Party of Democratic Socialism. ``That is the goal
and nothing else.''
   He said his party already has surrendered a large part of its
property.
   Richard Schroeder, leader of the Social Democratic lawmakers in
Parliament, said the proposal is aimed at shedding light on who owns
what in the country.
   ``We should bring clarity and light to the property proportion,''
he said. ``We have the impression that the history of the former
Communist Party property is still being written.''
   The property investigation would cover all parties, unions and
organizations that came into being after 1945, but is clearly aimed
at the assets of the old regime.
   It would technically include de Maiziere's own Christian
Democrats, who were allowed to exist as a formal party.
   Large amounts of property are believed held by former Communists.
   Prosecutors on Thursday charged a former district Communist Party
chief from the city of Erfurt, Gerhard Mueller, with breach of trust
and theft, the government news agency ADN said.
   Mueller, 62, was arrested in December. He is accused of building
a luxurious hunting lodge with three baths at a cost of $210,000 in
public money.
   Many questions remain about the pace and process of distributing
land and industries owned by the state to private hands.
   West Germany wants West Germans to be able to reclaim any
property they lost in East Germany when the Communists came to
power. East Germany wants its citizens to have first crack at the
property.
   East Germans are expected to face a rough transition to a free
market in July. Widespread joblessness and rising prices are
expected as socialist subsidies are eliminated and outmoded,
state-supported factories are forced to compete.
   East Germans fearing higher prices have been lining up at grocery
stores to stock up on food and other household goods, creating huge
shortages of meat, milk and other necessities, officials said.
   Lawmaker Vera Wollenberger said meat was selling out in stores
within one hour of opening in the cities of East Berlin and Halle.
   Commerce Minister Sybille Reider said consumer demand has
increased 300 percent to 400 percent in recent days. Soap, bread and
other goods are selling out, she said.
   A line formed early Thursday at a large East Berlin grocery store
selling both East German and West German goods.
   Clerk Jutta Petrick said the crush of hoarders began about two
weeks ago. ``We are running out of everything,'' she said, gesturing
to the sparse shelves.

<HEAD>Bond Measure Asks $332 Million for San Francisco Earthquake Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   San Francisco officials don't want to wait
until the next big earthquake to repair and protect about two dozen
municipal buildings, including City Hall, from the ravages of a
major tremor.
   So nearly eight months after the Oct. 17 quake, voters are being
asked Tuesday to approve the city's largest-ever bond measure to pay
for quake repairs and quake-proofing.
   Mayor Art Agnos and other city leaders are pushing Proposition A,
which would allow the city to raise $332 million to pay for quake
repairs and seismic improvements to the city-owned buildings during
the next decade.
   ``You cannot escape the reality that this work has to be done,''
said Rudy Nothenberg, the city's chief administrative officer.
   There has been little controversy surrounding Proposition A, he
said. The measure has been unanimously endorsed by the city Board of
Supervisors and faces no opposition from other groups.
   ``This is work the city would have had to do in any event sooner
or later, and given our experience in the last year, we thought
sooner rather than later,'' said Nothenberg.
   The biggest chunk of the money _ $207 million _ would be spent
preparing about 20 buildings, including City Hall and the War
Memorial Opera House, for another quake.
   The second priority would be addressing the estimated $53 million
in needed earthquake-damage repairs left over from the October quake.
   An additional $26 million would be spent to fix underground sewer
lines and pipes at the San Francisco Zoo that fractured in the quake.
   The federal government may eventually reimburse the city for an
undetermined amount of the repair costs, Nothenberg said.
   The quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, caused more
than $7 billion in damage in Northern California.
   A month after the earthquake, voters approved an $60 million bond
issue for emergency repairs and some initial seismic strengthening.
   Most of the buildings on the Proposition A list are in critical
need of strengthening or repairs because of the numbers of people
that use them.
   City Hall requires the most time-consuming and expensive work.
   It will cost about $94 million to make the building more quake
resistant through a method called ``base isolation,'' Nothenberg
said.
   City Hall would be separated from its foundation and placed on
rollers that would absorb some of the shock when the next quake
hits, he said. An additional $23 million would be spent to fix a
crack in the plaster of the rotunda and reattach loose marble on
walls and archways.
   The bond issue also would pay for less expensive repairs and
reinforcements to the 3,000-seat Opera House, the 10,000-seat Civic
Auditorium, the Veterans Building and the Public Health building.

   Australian rock band Midnight Oil took their
music and environment theme to the streets, performing amid the
skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan for a lunchtime crowd.
   ``We've got a megacrisis on our hands that we all have to
approach,'' lead singer Peter Garrett said after Wednesday's
performance. ``We've got a crisis that our leaders, corporations and
governments have a prime responsibility to address seriously.''
   The band is on a U.S. tour to promote their new album, `Blue Sky
Mining.''
   Although they have been performing for 10 years, their U.S.
breakthrough wasn't until 1987 with their hit song ``Beds Are
Burning'' from their album ``Diesel and Dust.''
   Their songs concentrate on the ecosystem, world peace, and
corporate greed. At the invitation of Midnight Oil, the
environmental group Greenpeace sets up information tables at each
concert.
   Garrett is also an attorney and president of the Australian
Conservation Foundation, the country's leading advisory board on
problems of national heritage and environment.
   ``We can't just do a one-day Earth Day,'' said Garrett.

   After a two-year hiatus, Willie Nelson is
reviving his Fourth of July picnic and outdoor concert, with help
from officials of his hometown.
   The country singer's last Fourth of July bash was in 1987 in
north Texas, where it drew only about 8,000 people.
   Nelson's daughter, Lana Nelson, and Mayor Lee Cooke announced
Wednesday that the party will be revived this year in the city's
Zilker Park.
   Over the years, the picnic has been held in a variety of
locations and sometimes marred by arrests and vandalism.
   Cooke said his city would be happy to sponsor the event with the
promise that $1 of every ticket sold would benefit a children's
playground in the park.
   ``I say welcome back, Willie,'' the mayor said.
   Nelson, performing in Las Vegas, was not on hand for the
announcement.
   This year's lineup includes Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson,
Waylon Jennings, Kinky Freedman, Johnny Gimble and Kimmy Rhodes. The
Geezinslaw Brothers, Asleep at the Wheel, Little Joe y La Familia,
and Little Whisper and the Rumors will also appear.

   A Japanese company has withdrawn a $46
million offer to buy Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill golf club and is suing
the golfer and other owners to get back its $3 million deposit.
   WDI Systems Inc. said in its breach of contract lawsuit that club
buildings are riddled with asbestos and that club owners did not
file some required income tax materials, among other complaints.
   ``The allegations are totally devoid of merit,'' said William
Carpenter, a lawyer for the Cleveland-based International Management
Inc., an agent in the sale and one of the defendants.
   ``There's nothing to these complaints,'' Carpenter said Wednesday.
   WDI agreed to purchase the club, site of an annual professional
golf tournament, in February. It paid the $3 million deposit and
gained access to the club and its records.
   Palmer owns 47 percent of the club. Club officials said Thursday
he was out of town and unavailable for comment.
   International Management is known as the biggest sports agency in
the world. It represents or has represented top athletes such as
Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Chris Evert.

   Musician Duke Robillard will be taking
his guitar south, replacing Jimmie Vaughan in the blues-rock band
Fabulous Thunderbirds.
   ``It's a very comfortable situation for me to walk into,'' he
said. ``We're all excited to see how it's going to work out, what it
will sound like.''
   Robillard is already familiar with the Austin, Texas-based band.
Drummer Fran Christina and bassist Preston Hubbard of the
Thunderbirds played with him in Roomful of Blues, the band he
founded in 1968. And Robillard toured with Thunderbirds' vocalist
Kim Wilson and others last summer.
   Meanwhile, Robillard has a tour planned with his own band through
June 16.
   The Thunderbirds were nominated for a Grammy for their biggest
success, ``Tuff Enuff,'' and the group was named blues band of the
year in 1986 by the Blues Foundation.

<TEXT>
   However big the headlines, this week's summit
seems unlikely to provide Mikhail S. Gorbachev with any quick
solutions to the burgeoning economic and political trouble at home.
The Soviet leader said as much Thursday, telling an enrapt American
audience that his reforms will depend on time and ingenuity.
   ``One has to wait nine months before a child is born,'' he said.
One translation quoted Gorbachev this way: Soviet thinkers, he said,
will have to ``twist their brains'' to achieve a successful,
market-oriented economy.
   In his animated luncheon remarks, Gorbachev appealed for Western
patience as he grapples with the Lithuanian independence movement.
His approach, he said, is to ``be very cautious, to consider a
matter seven times, or even 100 times before one takes a decision.''
   His summit partner, President Bush, has questioned Gorbachev's
action _ not his caution _ over Lithuania. The Kremlin leader
slapped an economic blockade on the republic and has declined to
lift it.
   Even as Gorbachev asked for forbearance, Bush pointedly mentioned
Lithuania as an area that divides the two nations. And there is
little on the summit agenda that is likely to ease the Baltic
rebellion or help the Soviet economy.
   ``Over the next four days we're not going to solve all of the
world's problems,'' Bush said in his welcoming remarks to Gorbachev.
He might have added ``nor the Soviet Union's.''
   Burning ethnic rivalries and growing nationalism in several
Soviet republics continue to threaten the stability of the union.
Gorbachev's plan to raise food prices touched off panic buying and
emptied store shelves.
   And political nemesis Boris Yeltsin won the presidency of Russia,
the vast republic that stretches the length of the Soviet Union with
more land and people than the other 14 republics combined. Yeltsin
immediately announced he would seek sovereignty for Russia, giving
its laws precedence over national law and effectively weakening the
union over which Gorbachev presides.
   The White House in recent months has expressed a desire to
buttress Gorbachev at home after concluding that Soviet stability
and Gorbachev's political survival are in the U.S. interest _
overriding anxiety over issues such as Lithuania.
   Agreement on a new trade pact, which would provide some tangible
benefits for the Soviets, is essentially at hand, but Bush has
backed away from signing it. He initially cited the Soviet
parliament's postponement of passage of a new law liberalizing
emigration policies. Now the administration is linking agreement on
trade with the lifting of Moscow's economic blockade against the
tiny Baltic republic.
   Even with a trade agreement, the Soviets would enjoy few
immediate benefits because their industries do not now produce much
that could compete on world markets. Improving production through
better training, quality control and industrial design will take
years in an economy that has effectively destroyed the work ethic
and has yet to implement long-promised market incentives.
   The Soviet president has argued passionately for trade
concessions to help his country pull out of its economic tailspin,
but few suggest there is anything short of a massive airlift that
could work fast enough to have an impact on the problems feeding
present public anxieties.
   Gorbachev's other summit goals _ agreement on cutting nuclear
weapons by 50 percent, eliminating chemical weapons and establishing
a non-threatening military posture for a unified Germany _ are
unlikely to help him much at home, where he already has established
his credentials as a peacemaker. But returning empty handed could
further weaken his stature if he were viewed as losing his
effectiveness in the international arena.
   At their first summit meeting, in Malta last December, Gorbachev
and Bush announced they would try to reach broad agreement on
reducing troops and conventional weapons in Europe by their next
meeting.
   That goal has proved elusive, and U.S. officials say the Soviets
are stalling and attribute the lack of progress to Soviet concern
about the future of Germany. Other observers have suggested
Gorbachev may want to slow the pace of withdrawal from Europe not
just for security reasons but because he is under pressure from his
own military, which has no place to house homecoming troops and
little enthusiasm for mustering out large numbers of career officers
in the shrinking of defense forces.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
welcomed 895 West Point cadets to the ranks of commissioned Army
officers Thursday and learned that one of them already is gunning
for his job.
   The ambitious cadet is Kristin Baker, 22, who had already risen
to the top of the academy by becoming brigade commander and the
first female captain of the corps of cadets.
   After Gen. Colin Powell told the graduates of the U.S. Military
Academy that the United States must maintain a strong military, even
though ``the prospect of peace is now more than a dream,'' he
appeared at a news conference with Baker.
   Powell noted that he and Baker had been appointed the same day
last October. Baker than admitted having aspirations to his job.
   ``It takes a long time,'' she said.
   ``About 30 years'' Powell said.
   ``See me in about 30 years,'' said Baker.
   Powell, 53, said the world has changed greatly since he entered
the military in the 1950s, but advised the newly commissioned second
lieutenants to recognize ``what has changed and what has not. We
must identify what threats have receded and which have not.''
   Powell said he believes Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is
``sincere in wanting to reform his country as he is in making sure
it continues to play a dominant role in world affairs.''
   But Powell said that despite any economic revolutions, ``one fact
remains: the Soviet Union will still possess thousands of nuclear
warheads that can destroy America in 30 minutes. We must never allow
ourselves to be at a nuclear disadvantage.''
   West Point's 806 male and 89 female graduates this year list that
includes Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Douglas MacArthur and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Women were admitted to West Point beginning in 1976. The two
Rhodes Scholarships awarded to cadets this year went to women:
Jennie Koch of Potomac, Md., and Carolyn Ford of Pensacola, Fla.
   Baker, born in Dickinson, N.D., de-emphasized her role as a woman
in her job as brigade commander and said there was still a lot to be
done for women at West Point. She called her appointment ``another
step in a long line of steps being taken for women'' at the
188-year-old school.

Responsibility</HEAD>

   Israel today urged the United States to end all
contacts with the PLO after seaborne Palestinian guerrillas loyal to
a top PLO official tried to attack crowded beaches and hotels on a
Jewish holiday.
   But PLO chief Yasser Arafat said the PLO was not responsible for
the attack and that he does not have the authority to take action
against the PLO official whose guerrillas claimed responsibility,
even if he wanted to.
   Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by Israeli forces in
Wednesday's Libyan-sponsored infiltration. No Israelis were harmed
in the attack, even though tens of thousands were on beaches for
Shavuot, the Jewish holiday that marks the giving of the Ten
Commandments.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Abbas, claimed
responsibility. Abbas, known as Abul Abbas, is a member of the PLO
Executive Committee and loyal to Arafat. He planned the 1985
hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   Israel radio said today the government had sent Washington
details of the interrogations of the 12 captured PLO guerrillas.
   Israeli leaders called Wednesday's attack proof that Arafat had
violated his December 1988 pledge to renounce terror. It was
Arafat's pledge that led the United States to open a dialogue with
the PLO.
   Arafat said today in Baghdad, where he attended a summit of Arab
leaders, that the PLO was not responsible for the guerrilla attack
on Israeli beaches.
   Asked whether he would expel Abbas from the elected PLO Executive
Committee for carrying out the attack, Arafat said:
   ``He was elected in a democratic way by the Palestine National
Council, and only the council has a say on that.'' He added, ``We
are a democratic organization, and decisions should be taken
democratically.''
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Motti Amihai claimed today
that Abbas and Arafat met in Tunis, Tunisia, five days before the
attack.
   ``We believe that Abul Abbas at that time knew for sure that this
operation is going to take place,'' Amihai said. ``I think there is
little doubt that Arafat personally, and also probably (Libyan
leader Moammar) Gadhafi, knew beforehand about this operation.''
   The PLO is an umbrella group for several factions. The smaller
groups sometimes fight among themselves or launch independent
attacks on Israel.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Israel would try to persuade
the United States to abandon contacts with the PLO.
   ``If we can convince them there that the basic assumption for
dialogue no longer exists, then it's possible that the United States
will decide to cease the dialogue,'' he said on Israel radio.
   ``The only question is whether they (the Americans) will see
reality as it is,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said it was too early to say whether the attack would
affect the 17-month dialogue, but added that ``we would view this as
a very serious matter.''
   She said the United States was ``horrified at this terrorist
attack'' and was ``pleased that all terrorists were apprehended or
killed in action.''
   The infiltrators were trained in Libya with the aim of attacking
``the hotels in the Tel Aviv region to conduct a massacre,'' said
Maj. Geb. Amnon Shahak, chief of army intelligence.
   The army said that on maps of Tel Aviv found in the possession of
the guerrillas, circles had been drawn the Kolbo Hashalom department
store, and Kings Square next to Tel Aviv city hall.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir did not say whether Israel would
retaliate against Libya. Asked on Israel television about the Libyan
involvement, he said: ``We have to take this into account.''
   According to army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the
infiltration began three days ago when a Libyan merchant ship
carrying five fiberglass speedboats and a refueling vessel left the
Libyan port of Benghazi, about 800 miles from Israel.
   Before dawn Wednesday, the mother ship cast off its cargo 120
miles off Israel. Three speedboats malfunctioned and the mother ship
and the refueling vessel sailed toward Egypt, Shomron said.
   Two boats, equipped with rockets, machine guns and anti-aircraft
missiles, headed toward the Israel coast.
   One of the boats, carrying 11 Palestinians, was attacked by
helicopters and troops of the elite Givati brigade as it sliced into
an almost empty beach near Nizzanim, 18 miles south of Tel Aviv.
Four guerrillas were killed there and seven captured.
   Israeli gunboats intercepted another boat near the communal farm
of Gaash, about 12 miles north of Tel Aviv, and five guerrillas
surrendered.
   Police ordered the evacuation of a 30-mile stretch of beaches
south of Tel Aviv jammed with people for Shavuot.
   ``Some bloodthirsty terrorists tried to turn our holiday into a
day of mourning,'' Shamir said. ``But the guardians of Israel
succeeded once again. The campaign organized by Abul Abbas was a
complete failure.''
   In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, Palestine Liberation Front
representative Hussein el-Abed said the attack was aimed at
``teaching the enemy a new lesson on the road to liberating
Palestine.''
   The faction supports armed struggle to establish a Palestinian
state.
   The infiltration came on the last day of the emergency Arab
summit in Baghdad. In a final communique, the summit blamed the
United States for the explosive situation in the Middle East. The
Arab leaders said U.S. backing for Israel encourages the Jewish
state to resist peace initiatives and settle Jews in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.

   African National Congress
official Glen Thomas has been released by police after protests from
the United States and four other Western nations, authorities said
Thursday.
   Thomas was the first ANC official to be detained since the
organization was legalized Feb. 2. He was held for almost three
weeks after being arrested May 11 following a meeting with ANC and
United Democratic Front activists.
   Police did not say why Thomas was detained nor elaborate on his
release Wednesday.
   The arrest was protested by the United States, Britain, West
Germany, Canada and Australia.
   The ANC also protested Thomas' detention under Section 29 of the
Internal Security Act, which allows police to retain suspects
indefinitely. It said the detention was not ``in the spirit'' of
talks with the government on ending white-minority rule.
   Thomas said his treatment by police was ``gentlemanly,'' but
expressed concern about Robert Nogumla, who was arrested with him
and is still held.

   A farmer in a once-rural area has been arrested
for plowing his fields too late at night after a neighbor in an
adjoining subdivision complained that the drone of the tractor was
keeping him awake.
   ``The way I feel, he moved next to the field _ the field didn't
move next to him,'' said Ray Dettmering, who farms 600 acres about
30 miles south of Chicago.
   ``The only question I have is, this fall when I go to harvest it,
what happens then?''
   Dettmering's neighbor, Leonard Reh, said he, too, must make a
living. And he can't because of the noise.
   ``I don't want to stop him from making his living,'' said Reh, a
Postal Service employee. ``But farming land at midnight is just a
little bit too outrageous.''
   Reh's home is in a new subdivision in Matteson, about 30 miles
southwest of Chicago. The village has seen an influx of middle- and
upper-middle class commuters in recent years.
   Reh and other neighbors say that since they must turn their
lawnmowers off at 7 p.m. because of village ordinances, why should a
farm tractor be different?
   And so, about 11 p.m. on April 26, police responded to Reh's
complaint. They tromped through muddy fields to arrest Dettmering as
he, his wife, Kathy, and a hired hand finished plowing the land he
leases.
   Dettmering faces a June 11 hearing on two counts of disturbing
the peace. Each count carries a maximum fine of $500 and six months
in jail.
   Dettmering, 28, of Peotone, has a day job and farms someone
else's land on nights and weekends.
   ``Almost all producers depend to a certain extent on rented
land,'' especially in rapidly urbanizing areas, said Ralph Heimlich,
an agricultural economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
Washington, D.C.
   Heimlich said suburban growth areas, while attractive to the
middle-class, often pose conflicts between suburbanites and their
farm neighbors.
   ``People want to move out in the country and enjoy the open
space, but some of the things that go with it aren't so pleasant,
such as spreading manure from a dairy operation or ... dust and
noise with a tillage operation,'' he said.
   Dettmering, who grew up in a farm family, said in a telephone
interview Thursday he'd like to be a full-time farmer but can't
afford it. He said he depends on his second job as a farm equipment
mechanic to make ends meet.
   ``I've got an eight-hour-a-day job,'' he said. ``There's not
enough money on the farm to be living off of.''
   The Illinois Farm Bureau estimates 25 percent of the family
farmers in the state work 200 or more days off the farm.
   ``If you have a small or medium-sized operation, for many people
they find it a necessity. It's just one of those facts of life,''
said Dennis Vercler, a bureau spokesman.
   This year, Dettmering said a wet spring has put him behind in
preparing the land for corn. The days when it wasn't raining meant
even longer days _ and nights _ in the field, he said.
   Reh said, however, he just wants a good night's sleep.
   ``I have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to work,''
he said. ``Whoever owned this land before used to work the land
during the day _ he never bothered anybody.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ephemeral, clean'' blue will signal the brash
new fashion statement of traffic agents, long saddled with the
nickname ``Brownies'' because of their oh-so-drab uniforms.
   ``Brown looks dirty; it seems to remind you of congestion,'' said
Joe DePlasco, spokesman for the city Department of Transportation.
   And so on Friday, at ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of
the traffic enforcement division, the department will reveal all _
via mannequins adorned with uniforms past, present and future.
   Much has changed since June 1, 1960, when the city sent forth its
first corps of so-called ``meter maids.''
   That all-woman ticket-writing force wore white blouses, navy blue
skirts and scarves, black kid pumps and a hat modeled after that
worn by the era's airline stewardesses. A men's version was created
when the force went co-ed in 1967.
   In 1974, the duds du jour became a brown skirt or pants; brown
jacket and overcoat; brown shoes; brown tie and white shirt.
   You might say that brown became all the rage after that. In
recent years, the color has become to some belligerent motorists
what red is to a bull.
   ``There is a lot of Brownie bashing that is going on in the
streets,'' said DePlasco. ``We'd like to change the image that
traffic agents can be abused by the public.''
   In the first four months of 1990, 167 traffic agents were
assaulted or otherwise confronted by unruly motorists; in the same
period last year, the number was 114.
   Besides, says DePlasco, the Brownies _ er, traffic enforcement
agents _ found their nickname to be pejorative. They hope the new
garb will signal a new era of respect.
   ``We think the uniform could give a greater sense of pride, would
be cleaner, look nicer, make the person feel happier about
themselves and win more respect from the public,'' said DePlasco.
   The city's 1,900 traffic agents will phase in the new look, using
their $480 a year uniform allowance.
   It will feature a navy blue hat, white shirt, navy blue tie, navy
blue jacket, gray trousers with a navy stripe and black shoes. A
committee is being formed to add the finishing touches, and the
final creation is expected by fall.
   ``We're willing to take suggestions from renowned New York
fashion designers,'' said DePlasco.

   A 9-year-old who flattened a
schoolmate's nose after the boy called him ``Fatso'' faces a felony
charge, and the father of the accused is outraged.
   Bobby Woods of suburban Sunrise is charged with aggravated
battery, a second-degree felony, in the fight with Khalid Fathallah
at an elementary school where both were attending summer school.
   ``This is incredible,'' Bobby's father, Nolan, said Wednesday.
``I think this kind of court time should be spent on kids who need
it. Kids vandalizing, raping, stealing. Not over a little
fistfight.''
   Bobby was charged partly because Khalid suffered a broken nose.
``That raises it above a simple schoolyard incident,'' said
Assistant State Attorney Gary Ford.
   But defense attorney Paul Stark said he would ask a judge next
week to dismiss the case.
   Bobby, who at 5 feet and 101 pounds is bigger than the average
9-year-old said the fight started after Khalid and another boy
called him names. ``Fatso ... `Hey, Fatso, like cookies? Oink, oink'
and all that,'' he said.
   If convicted, Bobby's sentence could range from a reprimand to
being put in state custody, Ford said. Ford said the youngster is
unlikely to suffer a heavy penalty because the 9-year-old has no
criminal record.

<HEAD>Algeria March Draws Tens of Thousands</HEAD>

   Tens of thousands of demonstrators on Thursday
marched through Algiers pressing for a ``true democracy'' in the
latest in a series of demonstrations leading up to the June 12
municipal elections.
   The peaceful demonstration was called by the head of the
Socialist Forces Front, Hocine Ait-Ahmed. It mostly attracted
Berber-speaking residents of the Kabyle regions; they carried signs,
mainly in the Berber language, calling for ``real democracy'' and
``linguistic pluralism.''
   The march, headed by a young girl carrying a rose, began at the
May 1 Square and passed the parliament building.
   Previous marches, by the Islamic Salvation Front on April 20, the
Democrats on May 10 and the ruling National Liberation Front on May
17, drew more than 100,000 people.
   At least 12 parties have cropped up since Algeria's Constitution
was changed last year to allow political pluralism. The June
municipal elections will be the first multiparty elections since
Algeria gained independence from France in 1962.
   The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front is seen as the ruling
party's main contender, expected to draw about one-third of the
votes.

<HEAD>High Wind Keeps Deaf and Blind Climbers From McKinley Summit</HEAD>

   An international team that includes two
blind climbers, a deaf climber and an amputee nearly made it to the
top of Mount McKinley, but 50 mph winds forced them to turn around,
officials said Thursday.
   The group got up to at least 18,000 feet, said Roger Robinson, a
U.S. Park Service ranger. At 20,320 feet, Mount McKinley is North
America's highest mountain.
   ``They've all descended. They're at 14,000 now. Indications are
they're not going back up,'' he said.
   ``They did very good considering that only about half the folks
that try McKinley make it to the top.''
   The ascent was attempted by 1,009 climbers last year; only 524
reached the summit.
   Adaptations were made for the disabled climbers.
   ``Apparently they've got ropes stretched out to the latrines when
they're at camps,'' said Bob Seiber, chief mountaineering ranger.
``They work extremely well together and develop their other senses,
I guess.''
   Patrick Reinhart, a member of the expedition and director of
Challenge Alaska, a group that helps develop recreational and sports
opportunities for disabled climbers, came up with the idea for the
ascent.
   Reinhart, who has an artificial foot, always wanted to climb
McKinley. So did Ross Watson, a Canadian member of the expedition
who lost his sight at age 12 in a pellet gun accident.
   Patrick Hurst, a 27-year-old Englishman who teaches outdoor
sports to physically disabled people, also is blind.
   Lkakpa Sonam, a Sherpa from Nepal, is deaf.
   In overall charge of the expedition is George Rooney, a member of
the American Alpine Club who's been up McKinley twice and tried
climbing Everest in a joint American-Polish expediton. He's also an
emergency medical technician and a specialist in mountain rescue.

   The normally placid, rolling lawns of
exclusive Wellesley College were crawling Thursday with Secret
Service agents, reporters and harried college administrators in
preparing for Friday's arrival of Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev.
   But the earlier commotion over Mrs. Bush's selection as
commencement speaker has all but disappeared.
   Instead, many of the students, teachers and alumnae trying to
dodge television camera crews inside the enormous tent had a new
gripe.
   In the words of graduating senior Kelly Brown, 21,: ``Now we have
this big circus and we just wanted a quiet graduation ceremony.''
   Graduation for the Class of 1990 at Wellesley, an oasis of brick
towers and woodsy green meadows in this affluent suburb 10 miles
west of Boston, will be anything but quiet.
   That was guaranteed last month when about 150 of Wellesley's
2,200 students signed a petition complaining that Mrs. Bush had
gained recognition through her husband's achievements. That, they
complained contradicted the school's philosophy that women should
stand on their own.
   Mrs. Bush will now address the 600 graduating seniors with Mrs.
Gorbachev at the Friday morning ceremony. The Gorbachevs arrived in
the United States Wednesday night for the start of a four-day summit.
   The two first ladies will speak for six minutes each. A phalanx
of Secret Service agents has been on campus for five days. Wellesley
security officials said the graduation tent, which will accommodate
5,500, was the biggest they have ever put up.
   The petition, co-authored by seniors Peggy Reid, 21, and Susana
Cardenas, 21, gained national attention. The two women said Thursday
that they still oppose the selection of Mrs. Bush as speaker, but
plan no protests.
   ``When she comes to speak I'm going to welcome her on her own
merits and not because she's the president's wife,'' said Reid, a
religion major who plans to teach English in Costa Rica next year.
   Cardenas, an American citizen from Lima, Peru, echoed many on
campus when she said the media had distorted the intent of the
petition. She said students never wanted publicity about the
controversy and did not want to be ``discourteous'' to Mrs. Bush.
   ``We didn't intend it to be a personal judgment against her,''
said Cardenas. ``We brought the petition to the college president
and she was very sympathetic but said we couldn't change speakers
and it was resolved.''
   Others on campus said the petition, signed by about 150 students,
represented only a tiny minority of students.
   Marion Patterson, 82, president of the class of 1927, said she
attends every Wellesley graduation and is a ``great admirer of
Barbara Bush. She grew up in an era when careers weren't the mode.
She married and raised five children and I think she's a great asset
to the country.''
   Patterson took a dim view over the controversy about Mrs. Bush.
   ``I was distressed by it,'' she said. ``It was fostered by a
South American student here on scholarship.''
   Susan Hand, a college librarian whose two daughters have attended
Wellesley, said she was ``very angry'' about the media's
``distortion'' of events.
   ``I never heard anybody talking out against it,'' Hand said. ``I
think Barbara Bush coming will be neat and interesting for the kids.
She has a different point of view from a lot of them but it's good
to have a different point of view.''
   Karen Tucker, 22, a graduating senior from Cambridge, said
Thursday that ``most people are happy with the decision.''
   ``When you think of a commencement speaker, you look for
inspiration and I think Mrs. Bush proved herself of being capable of
providing inspiration,'' she said.
   Mary Griffin, 21, a junior who was jogging across campus Thursday
morning, looked wistfully over at the graduation tent.
   ``I wish it was my year,'' she said. ``I was really excited when
I heard about them coming. It's exciting when you think _ we're
going to have the first ladies of the two superpowers here.''

<HEAD>Archaeologist Finds 200-Year-Old Shoes in Well</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you can tell a lot about people by
the shoes they wear, archaeologists in the nation's oldest city hope
to learn something about whoever lost a pair in a well 200 years ago.
   City archaeologist Carl D. Halbirt retrieved the shoes and other
valuable finds during the past month from an underground well.
   ``It's kind of a rarity to find leather shoes,'' Halbirt said
Wednesday. ``It doesn't happen all the time, and I've got two of
them.''
   The worn leather shoes are wet but preserved. They have heels
with the cobbler nails still in them, and an area on the front where
buckles would fit.
   ``The water in the well area is slightly alkaline, which helped
preserve everything,'' he said.
   The shoes are probably about the equivalent of size 8-8{ in
contemporary men's shoes, said Halbirt.
   Lab work will be needed to determine their exact age.
   Other items found in the well include a pocket knife, bucket
handle and some nails, all of which date to about 1780-1800.
   The well was discovered during the city's installation of new
utility lines under a street.

   A strong aftershock rocked Romania,
Bulgaria and the Soviet republic of Moldavia before dawn Thursday,
causing people to flee into the streets a day after a major
earthquake killed at least 14 people.
   The 3 a.m. aftershock was the strongest of about 100 recorded
after Wednesday's quake, which was felt from Moscow to Istanbul and
caused serious structural damage to buildings in Romania and
Bulgaria, officials said.
   Romania's Ministry of Health reported nine people were killed in
Wednesday's quake and 994 people injured. A ministry communique on
Radio Bucharest said 207 required hospitalization. The temblor also
killed one person in Bulgaria and four in southern Moldavia.
   There were no reports of casualties Thursday.
   The Bulgarian news agency BTA said that, like Wednesday's quake,
the aftershock was centered in the Carpathian Mountain region of
Vrancea, in northern Romania.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
measured Wednesday's quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale and
Thursday's aftershock at 5.9.
   In Moldavia, which borders Romania, the quake left four people
dead and 30 injured but caused little structural damage, the
chairman of the national legislature said.
   Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov said in Moscow that one
person died in Moldavia after jumping out a second-floor window, two
elderly people died of heart attacks and that another also died from
undisclosed injuries, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Earthquakes also struck two parts of Latin America.
   An earthquake measuring 6.1 rocked the western areas outside
Mexico City before dawn Thursday, frightening residents but
apparently causing no serious damage or injuries.
   Late Tuesday, an earthquake in northern Peru left at least 135
people dead, Civil Defense officials said Thursday. The quake
measured 6.3, and was centered 400 miles north of the capital Lima
near the jungle villages of Moyobamba and Rioja. Aftershocks were
also reported in that area Thursday.
   Damage from Thursday's Romanian aftershock appeared most serious
in Vrancea County, 190 miles northeast of Bucharest, where the state
news agency Rompress reported ``panic and a large amount of material
damage.''
   Severely damaged were the mayor's house, a theater, a medical
center, the national bank and a building with 60 apartments in the
county capital of Focsani, it said.
   In northern Bulgaria, thousands of people frightened by the
aftershock reportedly spent the night in the street, or fled their
cities.
   Cities and villages on the Danube River, including Ruse, Silistra
and Svishtov ``were panic stricken,'' BTA said.
   It said thousands of people milled around city streets all night,
or fled in their cars. The city of Silistra has appealed for aid,
saying it urgently needed glass, cement, bricks and tiles to repair
damaged homes, schools, kindergartens and the lone hospital, the
agency said.
   In Bucharest, people fled into the streets and stood in small
groups under dim lights. In the Bucharest Hotel, about a dozen
people remained in the lobby, frightened to go upstairs.
   Dumitru Enescu, director of Romania's Earth Physics Institute,
told Rompres 100 aftershocks were recorded in the first 26 hours
after Wednesday's quake, some as high as 4 on the Richter scale.
   Damage reports from Wednesday's quake continued to filter into
the capital. In Urziceni, 38 miles east of Bucharest, the roof of a
technical-medical store collapsed, destroying the building. Nobody
was injured.
   In the capital Wednesday, chunks of concrete from high-rise
buildings crashed to the ground, crushing two people to death.
Ceilings fell, walls cracked, books toppled from shelves, and tens
of thousands of people rushed into the streets, many crying and
screaming in fear.
   Romanians leaped in panic from windows and balconies, and some
were badly hurt, ambulance officials said.
   The quake hit when Bucharest's streets were crowded with
lunch-hour shoppers and pedestrians. It lasted about 45 seconds and
was the third major earthquake since 1977 with its epicenter in the
Romanian Carpathians.
   The Uppsala Seismological Center in Sweden said it was felt so
widely because it was about 63 miles deep.
   ``I think it was this deafening sound of cracking walls that
scared people,'' said clerical worker Sica Burcea, 52. ``The
building was swinging horizontally and vertically. We were lucky
only to have some cracks in the walls. I shivered when I realized
1977 was coming back.''
   More than 1,500 Romanians died in a 1977 earthquake.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a quake
as measured by the ground motion on seismographs. A quake measuring
6 can cause severe damage. One of magnitude 7 is considered a major
earthquake.

<HEAD>At Lunch with Gorbachev: Flattery, Joshing and Caviar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev used a wily politician's
old trick to win over his audience at lunch: flatter them and call
out to some by name.
   There was Henry Kissinger and Gorbachev ribbed him gently,
calling him, ``my old man who always contests things.''
   There was musician Van Cliburn, ``and,'' said Gorbachev, ``I
heartily welcome him here, because he has done much to promote
understanding between our two peoples.''
   Cliburn was accompanied by his mother, Rildia Bee, who will be 94
in October. The concert pianist responded to Gorbachev's greeting,
saying how much he appreciated Gorbachev's hospitality in the Soviet
Union last summer.
   He said Gorbachev's attendance at his concert there ``thrilled
all my friends in Texas.''
   There was John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist.
Gorbachev called him ``a wise man, being loaded with knowledge.''
   The Soviet president twitted him, too, noting that Galbraith had
switched to another table ``so that we could see him better.''
   The occasion was a chicken kiev and caviar lunch at the Soviet
Embassy. It came between summit session one and two.
   The guests, bearing invitations in oversized envelopes, climbed a
wide carpeted staircase in the old mansion, passed a portrait of a
glaring Lenin, and sat down at round tables covered with pink linen
and laden with china and were treated to a long, long rambling
welcome from their host.
   His theme: the age of Soviet-American alienation is over.
   ``We are living in one civilization,'' he said, ``regardless of
all the differences that we have _ and I believe the differences are
not a liability, it is a plus to a certain extent because it
provides a good foundation for reaching a higher level plane of
knowledge...''
   The flattery came when Gorbachev called his guests ``members of
the American intellectual community.''
   Some would fit that title _ certainly Galbraith, certainly
cowboy-boot clad Stephen Cohen of Princeton, one of America's
keenest analysts of the Soviet system _ but most probably would
reject being called intellectuals.
   The old Hollywood was represented by Gregory Peck. From the new
Hollywood came Jane Fonda, wearing a short and clingy orange suit
and holding hands with her latest escort, cable television mogul Ted
Turner.
   Raisa Gorbachev reportedly had especially wanted to meet some
movie stars.
   It was an eclectic group. Jesse Jackson was the only out-and-out
politician. The Washington cultural community was represented by
James Billington, the Librarian of Congress and also a noted
Sovietologist, and by Robert McC. Adams, head of the Smithsonian.
   Also present: Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of a U.S.
president, and her Soviet husband, physicist Roald Sagdeev, and
Pamela Harriman, doyenne of the Democratic Party and widow of FDR's
wartime ambassador to Moscow; science fiction writers Isaac Asimov
and Ray Bradbury, two authors who, Gorbachev said, turning on the
flattery again, were his daughter's ``favorites.''
   Mingling among the guests were 40 Soviet members of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences. Wesley Posvar, president of the University of
Pittsburgh, said the fact they were flown to Washington just for the
occasion was important, ``more than symbolic.''
   After lunch, Kissinger said the affair was a disaster _ ``for my
diet.''
   He called Gorbachev ``serene.'' The Rev. Leo J. O'Donovan,
president of Georgetown University, said the Soviet leader was
extraordinarily relaxed ``and a smile played constantly around his
mouth.''
   For Cliburn, the occasion must have brought forth old memories.
He won a reputation and esteem for American musicianship when he won
the Tschaikowsky music competition in Moscow in 1958 and was
welcomed home as a national hero, ``the new American Sputnik.''
   During Gorbachev's first American summit, with Ronald Reagan in
December 1987, American ``intellectuals'' were also Gorbachev's
guests at a mix-and-mingle reception at the embassy. Kissinger was
there then too.
   Last time, Yoko Ono and Billy Graham were guests. Ms. Ono wasn't
there this time, and religion was represented this time by Robert
Schuller, the televangelist who has been asked to prepare 12
spiritual messages to be aired on television to the Soviet people
over the next year.

   Rain fell across the South on Thursday, with locally heavy rain
in already sodden parts of Texas and Louisiana, and temperatures hit
record lows around parts of the Great Lakes.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon over
southeastern Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, northeastern Texas and
the southern half of the Florida Peninsula. Showers were scattered
over central Georgia and east-central Missouri, and light rain fell
over southwestern Missouri.
   The heaviest rain was over sections of northwestern Louisiana and
east-central Texas, areas already hard hit by flooding along the Red

   Shreveport, La., got 3.30 inches of rain between 2 a.m. and 8
a.m. EDT, and 2.09 inches fell during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
at Monroe, La., the National Weather Service said.
   Rain and showers extended from the northern Pacific Coast and the
northern coast of California inland all the way to the northern
Rockies, with showers turning to snow at higher elevations. Redding,
Calif., tied its record low of 48.
   As much as 8 inches of new accumulation of snow was possible at
higher elevations of the Oregon Cascades.
   South of the rain and snow, high wind advisories were posted over
the valleys of southwestern Utah, extreme southern Nevada and the
eastern Mojave Desert in California.
   Unseasonably cool air rolled southward across parts of the Great
Lakes. Record lows included 38 at Pittsburgh; 36 at Muskegon, Mich.;
and 35 at Youngstown, Ohio. Harrisburg, Pa., tied its record of 43,
and Wilkes-Barre-Scranton, Pa., tied its record of 39.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38 at
Redmond, Ore., to 97 at both Beeville and Wink, Texas.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 29 at Truckee, Calif.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices Up in May, USDA Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products increased 2
percent from April to May, raising the overall commodity index 3.4
percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Higher prices for hogs, corn, hay, broilers and lettuce fueled
the increase over the last month, the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   The average price for all hogs of $60.50 per hundred pounds of
live weight was the second highest on record, topped only by $62.10
in August 1986.
   Lower prices were reported for eggs, onions, milk and cattle.
   While beef cattle prices showed a slight decline, calf prices
increased. Prices for sorghum and soybeans were also up from April
levels, but barley, wheat and rice dropped slightly.
   USDA economists said the climb of 3.4 percent in the index of all
commodities over the year-earlier level was propelled by increases
in hogs, cattle, milk and grapefruit.
   The economists have been saying net cash income of farmers in
1990 may be in the range of $55 billion to $59 billion, compared
with about $53 billion last year. The record was $57.2 billion in
1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   Another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
net farm income for 1990 may be in the range of $47 billion to $51
billion, according to USDA. Last year's level of $49 billion set a
record.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by the department to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the May price index for
livestock and poultry rose 1.2 percent from April and averaged 10
percent above the level of a year ago.
   Milk prices dropped 20 cents from April to an average of $13.20
per 100 pounds. Even so, the preliminary May price remained 90 cents
above the level of a year ago.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 3.1 percent from April but averaged
4.9 percent below the year-earlier level. Fruit prices fueled by
oranges and grapefruits were up 3.6 percent from last month, about
the same level as a year ago.
   The index for commercial vegetables climbed 3.4 percent from the
April level but was down 21 percent from a year earlier. Lettuce and
tomatoes were up while carrots and onions were down.
   Tomatoes averaged $18.70 per hundred pounds, up from $14.60 last
month, although still far below the May 1989 figure of $43.30.
Lettuce was at $10.90 per hundred pounds, up from $8.32 last month
and $6.84 a year ago.
   Carrots sank to $7.71 per hundred pounds from $10.60 in April and
a year-earlier level of $18.20. Onions averaged $13.80 per hundred
pounds, down from $19.40 in April but above the $9.47 of a year ago.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $74.30 per hundred pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $74.60 in April but up from $68.80 in May
1989. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $60.50 per hundred pounds, compared with $53.80 in
April and $41.60 in May 1989.
   _Corn, at $2.66 a bushel, was up from $2.51 in April and $2.58
from the level of a year ago.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.44 a bushel, compared with $3.49 in April and $4.01 a
year ago.
   _Rice averaged $7.21 per hundred pounds, compared with $7.31 in

   Fifteen Disneyland visitors paddling
furiously aboard a canoe kept getting wetter and wetter, apparently
in the belief a good soaking was part of the adventure. Moments
later, the boat sank.
   As the canoe slipped into the Rivers of America lagoon Tuesday
evening, about six riders swam to shore while others treaded in the
8-feet-deep water for a second canoe and a raft, said Brian Burnap,
a park visitor from Sacramento.
   Burnap said they didn't panic. In fact, most of the riders
remained stoically in their seats as the canoe took on water.
   Life preservers were stowed at both ends of the canoe, but in the
confusion they weren't distributed, said Disneyland spokesman Bob
Roth.
   The sinking was blamed in part on two young men who splashed and
rocked the canoe, causing it to take on water, Roth said.
   The only injury was a bruised toe, Roth said. The soggy riders
were taken to a first-aid station, where they were given clothes to
wear while theirs dried.
   The canoes continuously loop Tom Sawyer Island in the theme
park's Frontierland section. A Disneyland employee steers and a
second crew member rides in the front while riders paddle the course.

<HEAD>NY Police Evicting Beggars from Subway, Rail Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have begun evicting the city's panhandlers
and homeless from their last great public refuges: the subways,
Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal.
   The Transit Authority on Wednesday began aggressively ejecting
panhandlers from the subways and removing sleeping people from
station floors and benches.
   The Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road
said that on Friday they will begin enforcing court-approved
regulations banning begging and various activities, such as sleeping
or using more than one bench seat, primarily associated with the
homeless.
   The evictions have drawn criticism from advocates for the
homeless.
   In recent years, the homeless have gone to Grand Central, Penn
Station and the subways in search of warmth during the winter and
for safety year-round.
   On May 10, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
panhandling in transit systems didn't amount to constitutionally
protected free speech.
   ``The courts clearly said the subways are not the place to wage
the social battles,'' Transit Authority police chief William J.
Bratton said Thursday. ``They have to be waged elsewhere.''
   Bratton said authorities have to demonstrate that they are in
control of the subways. ``It's been quite apparent that the previous
approach to panhandling was not giving that sense at all, that we
were being laughed at,'' he said.
   An estimated 400 people a night have been spending the night at
Penn station, officials said. A count for Grand Central wasn't
immediately available.
   The prohibition on panhandling was part of Operation Enforcement,
a set of rules outlined by the Transit Authority last October.
   In April, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which overesees the
Transit Authority and the commuter railroads, approved regulations
for behavior in railroad stations.
   Under Bratton's orders, beggars are to be ejected without warning
regardless of whether they are aggressive or passive. The police
chief said he would be satisfied with a 25 percent reduction in
panhandling.
   He also labeled as ``bogus'' and ``baloney'' accusations that the
effort against begging would divert officers from fighting
escalating crime in the subways.
   Among those criticizing the evictions was Peter Smith of the
Partnership for the Homeless advocacy group.
   ``Where are the homeless supposed to go, where are they supposed
to beg?'' Smith said. ``Is the MTA going to put together a shuttle
to the moon? It's getting absurd.''
   But the eviction plan is supported by shopkeepers at Penn Station.
   ``It's not good for business to have people sleeping down here,''
said Singh Cheema, who runs a jewelry store near Track 17. ``Some
customers are offended.''
   At 2 a.m. on any given night at Penn Station, the homeless sleep
side by side _ pregnant women, children, gray-haired men with
crutches by their sides, an occasional person with a dirty plaster
cast on an arm. The huddled line stretches for a block.
   Until Friday, the sleepers were rousted at 5 a.m. On Friday,
anyone lying down at any time or using more than one bench seat will
be awakened and told about available social services, said Long
Island Rail Road spokesman Brian Dolan.
   ``If they refuse to take advantage of the assistance offered ...
they will be told to leave the station,'' Dolan said. ``They will be
ejected.''
   At Grand Central, Metro North has already closed off many areas
previously inhabited by the homeless, and began enforcing the
panhandling ban the day after the May 10 court ruling. Social
services are available there also.

   An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter
scale shook metropolitan Mexico City early Thursday, sending
frightened residents into the streets. The Red Cross reported no
injuries or major damage.
   The 1:35 a.m. jolt, which lasted 15 seconds, was centered about
180 miles southwest of this quake-prone capital, according to the
U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center at
Golden, Colo.
   Hotel clerks in Acapulco said the quake was felt in the Pacific
resort but that there was no damage.
   Mexico City, spread across a basin prone to earthquakes, suffered
one of the century's most devastating temblors on Sept. 19, 1985.
   That earthquake, which measured 8.1, and an aftershock the next
day, left 9,500 people dead and 150,000 homeless.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake measuring 6 can cause severe damage. A 7 reading is
a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a
``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

   The collision of two Air National Guard
fighter jets while one was carrying a newspaper editor probably will
not change Guard policy on public relations flights, a spokesman
said Thursday.
   But the South Dakota Air Guard will not be able to take any more
civilians aloft for a while because one of the A-7s that crashed
Wednesday over northwestern Iowa was the Guard's only two-seater,
Capt. Reid Christopherson, Guard executive officer, said in Sioux
Falls, S.D.
   ``At the national level, I don't anticipate and am not aware of
any reason why it should change the way that program's
administered,'' Christopherson said.
   The pilots of both planes and Ward Bushee, executive editor of
the Sioux Falls (S.D.) Argus Leader, ejected and parachuted to the
ground.
   The pilots were released from a Spencer hospital after treatment
of minor injuries.
   Bushee, who was invited to join the flight as part of the Guard's
public relations program, was listed in fair condition at McKennan
Hospital in Sioux Falls. The hospital would not comment on the
extent of Bushee's injuries or when he would be released.
   Bushee said from the hospital that his sixth vertebra was chipped
and he suffered burns on his left arm, shoulders and knees. Bushee
said he wouldn't need surgery, and expected to be released Saturday.
   Christopherson said taking civilians on a flight is a lengthy
process that goes through the public affairs office at the Pentagon.
An editorial by Bushee in August that criticized ceremonial flyovers
did not affect that decision, he said.
   Bushee gave his newspaper an account of his flight with Maj.
Duncan Keirnes, of Sioux Falls, saying it started smoothly and that
they later went into a dogfight exercise with another jet. Then the
two planes collided.
   ``Duncan hit the ejector button as soon as we hit,'' he said,
``sending me exploding through the canopy and him following a second
later. Then everything came apart. It was just a ball of flame.
Duncan later told me that if he had waited a couple of seconds
longer to eject, we would have been crispy critters.
   ``It was just a surreal scene. I was floating up in the air and
my flight suit was burning like a torch. My first thought was, `I'll
never see my wife and kids again. This is it.'
   ``Pieces of the plane were going by. Flames were all over me. I
couldn't remember where the cord was to open the parachute, but it
went open automatically.''
   Christopherson said the unit's guest-ride program is part of the
Guard's national public relations program.
   ``We probably do two to four of these a year,'' he said. ``The
program will probably continue,'' he said. ``I don't see any reason
why it shouldn't.''
   Christopherson said neither of the pilots faced disciplinary
action and both could continue to fly military missions.
   ``Any restrictions would be strictly limited to medical
decisions,'' he said. ``I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be
returned to flying status.''
   Keirnes and the other pilot, Maj. Gregory Gore of Collierville,
Tenn., are pilots for civilian air lines, but Christopherson
declined to say which ones.
   The Guard would not release names of two other pilots flying in
the same exercise and would not permit interviews with any pilots.
   Christopherson said the accident was the first since the South
Dakota Air National Guard unit began flying the A-7s in 1977 and
that the Guard last lost a plane in 1974.
   ``The airplanes probably won't be replaced,'' he said. ``We are
scheduled to convert from A-7s to F-16s in early 1992.''
   Christopherson said he talked to both pilots early Thursday but
that there was no discussion on what caused the crash.
   The Guard is determined to get to the bottom of what happened,
Christopherson said.
   ``It's in no one's best interest to hide anything,'' he said.
``The objective is to learn from what went wrong.''

<HEAD>Soviet Moldavia Recognizes Independence of Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature of Soviet Moldavia on Thursday
recognized Lithuania's independence, the Tass news agency reported,
making it the first Soviet republic outside the Baltics to do so.
   The move by lawmakers in the southwestern republic represented a
direct challenge to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts
to isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev imposed an economic embargo of key raw materials to the
Baltic republic for failure to rescind its pro-independence laws,
and he has decreed Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence
to be unconstitutional.
   According to the official news agency Tass, deputies of the
Moldavian Supreme Soviet, meeting in the capital of Kishinev,
favored the establishment of direct diplomatic, economic, political
and cultural relations with Lithuania.
   The legislature also proposed to exchange ``permanent missions''
with the Lithuanian parliament, or Supreme Council, Tass reported.
   The news agency did not give vote totals on the measure.
   So far, only the Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia have
formally acted to cooperate on such levels with Lithuania. On May
12, the three Baltic republics revived a 1934 political alliance
pledging mutual cooperation.
   Tass noted pro-Moscow deputies who are members of the ``Soviet
Moldavia'' alliance opposed the decision on recognition,
specifically objecting to the term ``diplomatic ties.'' They said
that term cannot be applied between republics that are part of the
same nation, Tass said.
   The news agency added that some members of the group were not
represented at the session because deputies from predominantly
Russian-speaking towns have not attended parliament since May 22. It
gave no reason for their absence.
   Like the Baltic states, the region that is now Moldavia was
forcibly annexed into the Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940.
   Before the annexation, Moldavia, then called Bessarabia, was part
of Romania and had long been regarded as a cradle of Romanian
culture.
   The Moldavian People's Front, an independent political movement,
has been pressing demands for greater autonomy from Moscow, although
it has moved cautiously on any reunification with Romania.
   The People's Front won a battle to establish Moldavian as the
official language of the republic and return to the Latin alphabet
used by Romanians, dropping the Cyrillic letters of the Russian
alphabet imposed under Stalin.
   Gorbachev's embargo, imposed April 18, cut off all oil, most
supplies of natural gas and other key raw materials to Lithuania
after it failed to rescind pro-independence laws.
   Since then, Lithuanian officials have sought to establish ties
with other Soviet republics to trade for materials the republic
desperately needs. One major obstacle to such an arrangement,
however, is that Moscow controls rail lines and highways needed to
transport goods to Lithuania.

<HEAD>A `Gonzo' Celebration After Charges Are Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Thursday formally dismissed all
charges against Hunter S. Thompson and the ``gonzo'' journalist
celebrated. He stood up and poured a glass of water on his own head.
   Thompson had been bound over for trial last week on three felony
counts of possession of a controlled substance and one of unlawful
possession of incendiary devices. He also faced misdemeanor charges
of sexual assault, simple assault and marijuana possession.
   Thompson, 53, was charged after Gail Palmer-Slater, a business
entrepreneur and former porn film producer, accused him of grabbing
her breast and throwing a drink at her when she visited his Woody
Creek home Feb. 21.
   She wanted to interview him for a story she planned to write.
   ``I didn't beat up that woman. She came to my house and got
sloppy and rude. If the taxi would have come sooner, this never
would have happened,'' Thompson said.
   During a telephone interview from her St. Clair, Mich., home,
Palmer-Slater, 35, said prosecutors decided to drop the charges
because of her background.
   ``I had a very public career in the mid '70s and I'm really easy
to trash, which is exactly the reason why I said I can't do anything
about this,'' she said Wednesday.
   ``But my husband insisted it be reported,'' she said. ``Then
Hunter said I was doing this for publicity, so I was damned if I
spoke to the press about my side and damned if I didn't, because
Hunter kept making all these statements about me.''
   Pitkin County District Attorney Chip McCarory said he didn't
think the case could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt anymore. He
said she changed her statements between the time she talked with
investigators and the time she testified at the preliminary hearing.
   After District Judge Charles Buss brought Thursday's 15-minute
hearing to a close, the courtroom audience applauded. Thompson rose
and poured a cup of water over his head.
   Thompson is best-known for his accounts of political campaigns,
shark hunts in Hawaii and the Hell's Angels. He often laced his
writing with exaggerated first-person accounts of drug and alcohol
abuse, a writing style that became known as ``gonzo'' journalism.

   An aftershock hit the southern Soviet republic of
Moldavia on Thursday, one day after an earthquake in the region
killed four people, injured dozens and damaged the homes of nearly
600 people, Soviet media reported.
   A government commission met in the republic's capital of Kishinev
to assess damage from Wednesday's earthquake, which measured 6.5 on
the Richter scale and was centered in neighboring Romania's
Carpathian Mountains.
   Tass said the earthquake caused significant damage to 40 schools,
42 day-care centers, 36 medical clinics and an undetermined number
of industrial and agricultural facilities.
   In Kishinev, about 1,000 apartments need emergency repairs, and
340 were being evacuated, the official news agency said, quoting
preliminary information.
   Worst hit were the southern regions of Moldavia, including the
cities of Komrat, Chadyr-Lunga and Kakhul, Tass said.
   Earlier Thursday, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature
in Moscow, Anatoly Lukyanov, said one of the quake's victims died
after jumping out a second-floor window. He also said two elderly
people died of heart attacks, according to Tass. Details on the
fourth victim were not immediately available.

<TEXT>
   Regional telephone giant NYNEX Corp. was
indicted Thursday on a charge of violating the 1982 court order that
broke up the old Bell system.
   The New York City-based company was indicted on one count of
criminal contempt of court for allegedly providing information
services to customers in violation of the 1982 consent decree.
   NYNEX denied any wrongdoing Thursday.
   The indictment is likely to provide ammunition to those opposing
efforts in Congress to lift some of the restrictions the 1982 decree
imposed on the regional Bell companies.
   The landmark 1982 ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene
had prohibited the seven regional Bell holding companies from
engaging in certain types of business, including processing
computerized data.
   The indictment, obtained by the Justice Department's antitrust
division, accused NYNEX through its Nashville, Tenn., subsidiary,
Telco Research Corp., of providing data processing and information
retrieval services over telephone lines from April 1986 to February
1987.
   The indictment did not cite possible penalties.
   Telco provided a computer and software to the long-distance
company, MCI Communications Corp., to aid in making MCI's network
more efficient, NYNEX spokesman Bob O'Brien said Thursday. He said
Justice alleged that NYNEX did not provide enough of the computer to
MCI.
   Justice said NYNEX violated terms of the 1982 consent decree,
known as the Modification of Final Judgment, that prohibit NYNEX and
the other regional Bell companies from providing information
services.
   The consent decree was set up to divide different types of
communication services between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
and the spinoff companies.
   ``Our position is that there was no violation of the MFJ,''
O'Brien said.
   NYNEX purchased Telco in April 1985 and ``Telco was providing
service through MCI prior to our acquisition,'' O'Brien said. NYNEX
in May 1986 asked Justice to scrutinize the computer service to
avoid any possible violation, he added.
   The indictment said NYNEX modified the MCI agreement on two
occasions, in April and October 1986.
   NYNEX, with Justice approval, subsequently tried to transfer
title of the computer to MCI, but MCI didn't want it and NYNEX ended
the agreement in February 1987, O'Brien said.
   In a statement, Assistant Attorney General James F. Rill said,
``A willful violation of any consent decree is a very serious matter
deserving of criminal penalties.
   ``A court order is the law and companies bound by a decree are
not free to deliberately or recklessly disregard that decree,'' Rill
said.
   The Federal Communications Commission in February fined NYNEX a
record $1.4 million for alleged $118.5 million in overcharges sold
by NYNEX's purchasing arm to its two telephone companies, New York
Telephone and New England Telephone.
   NYNEX appealed the fine.

<HEAD>Judge OK's Sale of PTL Network to California Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LUCY SOTO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge accepted a California evangelist's
$7 million bid for the PTL television network Thursday as the first
step toward selling the rest of Jim Bakker's bankrupt empire for an
additional $45 million.
   The religious cable network was sold to Morris Cerullo, an
Assemblies of God pastor who heads Morris Cerullo World Evangalism
Inc. of San Diego. The deal must also be approved by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   Cerullo on Wednesday signed a $52 million contract to purchase
all PTL assets if he could be guaranteed the cable network, PTL
trustee Dennis Shedd told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop.
   Cerullo can back out of the deal to buy the rest of PTL,
including Heritage USA, a retreat and religious theme park 10 miles
south of Charlotte, N.C. But Shedd expects Cerullo will make good on
his offer.
   ``He's the only person who went through the whole process of
negotiations. And he put his money on the table,'' Shedd told
reporters after the hearing.
   ``This may not be the terms everyone wants but ... it's the only
terms we could get,'' Shedd said. ``It's the best thing out there.''
   Cerullo on Wednesday deposited the $7 million for the network in
an escrow account, said Brad Leggett, an attorney representing Shedd.
   Shedd said he will ask Bishop to set a date before mid-July for a
hearing on selling the rest of the assets.
   Cerullo's organization has branches in Great Britain, Canada,
Israel and Zimbabwe. In 1978, he unveiled plans for a $100 million
``world outreach center'' in San Diego, but unlike Heritage USA, it
never materialized.
   ``It is our hope to go back and achieve what the Bakkers failed
to do,'' said Cerullo's attorney, Tim Treadwell. Cerullo didn't
attend the hearing.
   Treadwell said the ministry will most likely be moved to
California.
   Earlier this month, evangelist Oral Roberts signed a $6.45
million contract giving him the right to buy the cable network
unless someone else bid more or agreed to buy all of PTL's assets as
a package.
   Roberts didn't return a telephone message left Thursday at his
office in Tulsa, Okla.
   Bishop rejected four other offers, including an $8 million bid
from Media Arts International Ltd., to purchase the cable network
because the bidders wanted more time to negotiate.
   Treadwell said Cerullo would withdraw his offer if a delay was
granted.
   In approving Cerullo's offer, the judge included a stipulation
that cable television's Home Box Office must come to an agreement
with Cerullo over transfer of lease arrangements. HBO provides a
satellite for PTL.
   HBO had asked the court to block Shedd's deal with Roberts
because it doubted the evangelist could make the $242,000 monthly
payments for the use of its satellite.
   The closing date on the deal is Aug. 31, but can be extended if
the FCC doesn't grant Cerullo a license by then, Leggett said. If
the FCC rejects the license transfer due to some fault of Cerullo's,
PTL could keep $1 million of the $7 million Cerullo would have paid
for the network.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, three
months after Bakker resigned in the sex-and-money scandal that led
to his 45-year federal prison term for fraud and conspiracy.
   The failed ministry owes creditors millions of dollars.
   The PTL network still carries other evangelists' taped programs,
but Heritage USA, where Bakker had his studios and church, has been
closed since September. The 500-acre retreat also has five
restaurants, a $10 million water park and two 500-room hotels, one
of them unfinished. It includes about 1,700 undeveloped acres.
   Last year, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick failed to close on
a $65 million deal to buy PTL with bank financing. The lenders
wanted title insurance for Heritage USA; Mernick could not obtain it
because of a Catawba Indian lawsuit claiming that 144,000 acres,
including the Heritage USA site, was illegally sold to the state in
1840.

   West Germany's central bank denied
Thursday that it differed with the government's pace and terms for a
monetary union with East Germany.
   In a statement issued at a policy-making meeting, the Bundesbank
said it wanted to ``counter recent impressions'' in the news media
that the bank had not played a large enough role in negotiations on
the monetary union agreement.
   The central bank also said it was ``satisfied'' that its
requirements for a monetary union were met.
   The statement was similar to comments made late Wednesday by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, who said the central bank was
in agreement with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government on the
monetary union pact.
   ``I regret that the impression has arisen of a great
confrontation, a war between the Bundesbank and Bonn. The impression
is wrong,'' Poehl said Wednesday night.
   Earlier this year, the Bundesbank indicated it was opposed to
rapid monetary union. But it soon altered its stance and expressed
support for Kohl's push for quick union.
   Two weeks ago, the two German states signed a treaty under which
they will become a single economic entity beginning July 2.
   Under the treaty, West Germany's deutsche mark will be legal
tender for East Germans and all banking and monetary policy in East
Germany will come under the Bundesbank's jurisdiction.

   A defunct petroleum disposal company was
charged Thursday with illegally burning, dumping and storing
hazardous waste, including surplus napalm bombs.
   Prosecutors alleged that a puddle of waste from the company was
so noxious it melted the shoe soles of a passing jogger.
   ``An environmental crime is like a robbery or assault against all
of us,'' said Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who came to town
to announce the first federal felony environmental prosecution in
Utah.
   A 12-count indictment alleges Steven F. Self of Fallbrook,
Calif., and his defunct Ekotek Inc. of knowingly ignoring federal
environmental laws.
   The indictment provides a clear signal ``to environmental
profiteers seeking to improperly cash in on the growing
waste-handling business,'' Thornburgh said.
   The indictment alleges Ekotek ``duped environmentally conscious
businesses into believing that waste materials were being properly
disposed of.''
   The indictment alleges conspiracy to violate the clean air, water
and resources conservation and recovery acts and involves charges
that Self and others illegally burned and discharged solvents, oils,
grease and contaminated runoff, then concealed the violations by
falsifying manifests and logs.
   Self's attorney in Salt Lake City didn't respond to telephone
requests for comment.
   Before Ekotek was shut down by state regulators in October 1987,
residents of nearby homes complained of malodorous smoke coming from
the site.
   Prosecutors said a 17-year-old boy reported his shoe began to
``bubble and disintegrate'' after he accidentally stepped in a
puddle while running by the site.
   Ekotek _ which was in the business of recycling or destroying
waste oil products _ discharged into the public sewer system
approximately 10,000 gallons of wastewater per day, the indictment
said.
   The indictment alleges that in July 1986, Self arranged to accept
two napalm bombs for ``testing, storage and treatment'' from the
Navy Weapons Support Center in Fallbrook and later told state
officials they had been properly disposed of. State explosives
experts had to haul the bombs away the following year.
   Company vice president Steven F. Miller pleaded guilty Wednesday
to three felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal
environmental laws.
   Miller, who agreed to testify against Self and cooperate with
cleanup officials in exchange for his plea, faces up to 13 years in
prison and a fine of up to $750,000. He remains free on his own
recognizance.
   If convicted on all charges, Self and the company may be fined up
to $24 million and Self would face a prison term of up to 45 years.
   Miller's California attorney, Barbara Caulfield, said her client
would not comment before his sentencing July 31.
   The defendants are alleged to have purchased millions of gallons
of oils and solvents and burned them as fuel in a refinery, which
was about three miles from downtown Salt Lake City.
   State Department of Health officials said tens of thousands of
gallons of wastes have leaked or been dumped into the ground and
have contaminated nearby homes.
   Ekotek operated the site from 1981 until October 1987. Peter
Stevenson, the Environmental Protection Agency's on-scene cleanup
coordinator, said agency crews have been stabilizing and evaluating
the site since 1988. It has designated for EPA Superfund cleanup.

   NASA workers found a tiny leak in
Columbia's rear engine compartment Thursday, but judged it too small
to have caused the hydrogen leak that delayed the shuttle launch.
   ``The feeling is at this point that's probably not what they're
looking for,'' said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The search continued until late afternoon, then was halted so
Columbia's on-board fuel tanks could be drained. Officials planned
to increase pressure on the shuttle's external tank, which was
filled with nonflammable helium, to find the main leak, Buckingham
said.
   At a news conference in Washington, NASA administrator Richard
Truly said a special test _ using another gas chilled to a liquid
state _ might have to be run ``because the leak appeared only when
the temperature got so cold.''
   The external tank was being filled with more than a half-million
gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen Tuesday when
the leak was detected. NASA called off the launch, set for 12:38
a.m. EDT Wednesday, and drained the explosive propellant.
   Truly called the news conference to announce that NASA has
launched a program to solicit new and innovative ideas to carry out
President Bush's call for establishing a manned base on the moon and
sending a human expedition to Mars in the next 30 years.
   He named retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford, a veteran
of two Gemini and two Apollo space flights, to head the effort,
which will receive $4.5 million.
   Engineers believe Columbia's leak is in or near a 17-inch valve
in a pipe that carries fuel from the external tank to the main
engines.
   If the leak is detected and repairs can be made at the launch
pad, Columbia might be ready to lift off by the middle of next week.
But if Columbia has to be returned to a hangar, the delay would be
about a month, NASA officials said.
   Columbia's astronomy mission, with a $150 million observatory
called Astro, already had been delayed two weeks because of repairs
to the shuttle's cooling system. The latest postponement will mean
even more changes to Astro's observing schedule.
   One of the prime targets, Comet Austin, is speeding away from
Earth, making observations more difficult with every passing day.
Halley's Comet was to have been studied had the mission proceeded as
scheduled in March 1986, but the Challenger explosion pushed
everything back.

<HEAD>9-Day Shipping Strike on Danube River Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nine-day strike by 10,000 shipping
and harbor workers that paralyzed traffic on the Danube River ended
Thursday, the state news agency Rompres reported.
   The strike had left Romanian and foreign ships stranded for miles
along the famed riverway.
   Rompres said the shipping union and the Ministries of Labor,
Social Security, Finance, Economy and Transport reached agreement on
the workers' demands, issued in a May 23 communique,
   The demands included a 50 percent salary hike and retroactive
payment of night shifts for the past three years.
   Unions at Romania's largest steel plant, in the port of Galati,
said the length of the strike was beginning to affect the national
economy, noting their plant was running out of coal and limestone.
   Sailors, dockers, harbor workers and administrators struck in the
Danube ports of Galati, Sulina, Tulcea, Cernavoda and Braila.
   The government had previously agreed to some of the demands
presented by the shipping union on April 25: a 25 percent salary
increase for night shifts, allowances in hard currency and food
allocations for the merchant marine.
   Union leader Gheorghe Vrabia was quoted as saying Sunday: ``We do
not require the increase of our salaries. We just want to be given
back what had been taken back from us in the dictatorial regime (of
Nicolae Ceausescu). These are our rights and we will not cease the
strike until our claims will be met.''
   Ceausescu was overthrown in a popular revolt last December and
executed Dec. 25.

   Police are patrolling a university campus
in Ethiopia's capital to prevent further student demonstrations
protesting the recent execution of 12 top generals, Western
diplomats said Thursday.
   The envoys said students at the University of Addis Ababa began
boycotting lectures and staging demonstrations after the executions
were reported May 21. The most recent protest was Wednesday.
   The executions were reported on radio and television two days
after a special court convicted the officers of trying to overthrow
the government.
   ``The students began their protest immediately and riot police
moved in,'' said one Western diplomat.
   He said there were reports the students removed photographs of
President Mengistu Haile Mariam from the walls and replaced them
with those of the executed generals.
   He also said there were reports police arrested about 300
students and held them three days. There were, however, unconfirmed
reports some of the students were still in custody.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were
interviewed by telephone from Addis Ababa.
   The generals, including some of Ethiopia's most distinguished
military leaders, were convicted of staging an abortive coup against
Mengistu's government in May 1989.
   Loyalist troops crushed the revolt in three days, and at least 13
generals were killed in the fighting.
   The executed officers included Maj. Gen. Haile Gebre-Michael, 57,
commander of all ground forces; his deputy, Maj. Gen. Alemayehou
Desta, 55; and air force chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Solomon Begashaw.
   The trial of another 35 senior officers is continuing while an
additional 130 officers are awaiting trial.

   Here is a transcript of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's comments to reporters Thursday after his
second meeting with President Bush, as translated by Gorbachev's
interpreter.
   Q. ``Have you resolved the German question? With a new melody?''
   Gorbachev: ``Well, I think it is not here that the German
question will be resolved.''
   Q. ``Why not?''
   Gorbachev: ``I'll explain. But this extended meeting of two
delegations was dedicated to an exchange of views about the
development of the situation in Europe with due regard to the
settlement of all aspects relating to the external aspects of German
unification. I think that we have had a very substantive discussion
with the President, and also with other members of both the
delegations who participated. We understand the positions of each
other.
   ``I hope that we understand each other's concerns better as well,
and in this context both the US side and the Soviet side put forward
certain ideas, certain suggestions. And I believe, and the President
has agreed, that this exchange of views now requires that our
foreign ministers have a more in-depth discussion of these issues
and the experts who also participate, and we have instructed the
ministers to have that discussion. I understand that of course you
would like to find out more than I've said, but we don't know
everything yet.
   Q. ``Do you still think President Bush is dictating: NATO in
Germany, Germany inside NATO?''
   Gorbachev: ``Well, I will say this to this: President Bush is ...
what President Bush is doing is probably protecting ... defending
his viewpoint. I think that dictating is unacceptable in situations
when there are so many participants involved in this problem.''
   Q. ``Have you heard a different melody today or the ...''
   Gorbachev: ``Well, I think since ... since we have decided that
our ministers and experts should have a more in-depth discussion of
what was discussed today, I think that means that something has
emerged that requires such ... and our view is that ... our view is
... our view is that ... our view is that as a result of this
settlement of this question, not only the security of the Soviet
Union and of other countries should not be diminished but also no
damage should be done to the positive processes underway now in
Europe and elsewhere in the world and certainly no damage should be
done to the Soviet-US relationship which is very important. And
that's why we have to act in a very, very responsible way.''
   Q. ``Have you discussed economic assistance, and are you going to
ask for ... seek more assistance economically?''
   Gorbachev: ``Well, let's just say ... well, let's just say that
... let me say that in the morning, we had a rather conceptual,
philosophical discussion with the President, specifically, broadly
on US-Soviet relationship in this rapidly-changing world. And we
said that without Malta, without that meeting that we had in Malta,
and the exchange of views that we had there, really developments
could have taken a rather different course, and we predicted over
there in Malta, that there might be problems that we ... challenges
that we will have to meet, and it is very important to act in a
responsible and prudent way. And that is how we really acted after
Malta.
   ``And we have said that it is very important to have
understanding between our countries, and to continue to have that
understanding. So that was a rather broad and conceptual discussion
about the role of our two countries. And in that context, we did
discuss also the economic trends, and I made some explanations to
the President about the situation ... the economic reforms that we
are undertaking in the Soviet Union.
   ``But I would say that that was a discussion in that kind of
broad context. In addition, those economic matters, the matters of
economic cooperation, were discussed by our ministers and tomorrow
the Presidents will continue this discussion.
   ``Thank you.''

   The White House on Thursday rebuffed Israel's
plea to end all contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization
after an attempted beachfront attack on Israeli civilians. But the
White House condemned the action as a ``cowardly attempt to target
innocent people.''
   ``We are deeply concerned about the responsibility for this
attack and we are looking into it,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said about Wednesday's foiled attack on
beaches south of Tel Aviv by seaborne Palestinian guerillas loyal to
a top PLO official.
   Other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed
that no decision had been made on whether to keep talking with the
PLO or break off the discussions.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said in Baghdad the PLO was not
responsible for the attack and that he does not have the authority
to take action against the PLO official whose guerrillas claimed
responsibility, even if he wanted to.
   He said only the PLO Council could expel that official, Mohammed
Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, an Arafat loyalist and member of
the PLO Executive Committee who planned the 1985 hijacking of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   Fitzwater told reporters: ``We don't have any conclusions at this
point. We are investigating this matter and reviewing all the
information we can gather on it. We are very concerned about what
the ramifications might be but at this point we do not want to
express any conclusions.''
   Asked if continued discussions with the PLO was under review in
light of the fact that the administration has conditioned such talks
on PLO renunciation of terrorism, Fitzwater said, ``No, not at this
point.''
   He said the United States first wants to investigate the matter
and see who is responsible.
   ``President Bush condemns the terrorist attack yesterday in
Israel and is outraged by what appears to be a cowardly attempt to
target innocent people,'' Fitzwater said in a prepared statement.
   Other U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said they
don't consider Arafat's remarks to be the official PLO response.
   At the same time Arafat spoke, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia,
Robert Pelletreau, was meeting in Tunis with PLO officials. The U.S.
officials said they are awaiting a reply from the PLO to questions
set forth by Pelletreau.
   Once all the information is made available from the PLO and other
sources, the officials said a judgment will be made on how to
proceed.
   On Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
it was too early to say whether the attack would affect the 17-month
dialogue with the PLO on ways to peace talks started between Israel
and Palestinians, but added that ``we would view this as a very
serious matter.''
   Thursday the State Department referred all queries to Fitzwater.
   Israel urged the United States to end all contacts with the PLO
after seaborne Palestinian guerrillas loyal to Abbas tried to attack
crowded beaches and hotels.
   Israeli leaders called Wednesday's attack proof that PLO leader
Yasser Arafat had violated his December 1988 pledge to renounce
terror. It was Arafat's pledge that led the United States to open a
dialogue with the PLO after years of refusing to negotiate with the
organization.
   Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by Israeli forces who
headed off the attack. No Israelis were hurt in the attack, even
though tens of thousands were on beaches for the Jewish holiday of
Shavuot.
   Fitzwater said Bush commended the action of Israeli forces.
   Israeli officials claimed Abbas and Arafat must have known about
the attack in advance.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Motti Amihai said Abbas and
Arafat met in Tunis, Tunisia, five days before the attack.
   ``We believe that Abul Abbas at that time knew for sure that this
operation is going to take place,'' Amihai said. ``I think there is
little doubt that Arafat personally, and also probably (Libyan
leader Moammar) Gadhafi, knew beforehand about this operation.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said on Israeli radio that Israel
would try to persuade the United States to abandon contacts with the
PLO.
   ``If we can convince them (the United States) there that the
basic assumption for dialogue no longer exists, then it's possible
that the United States will decide to cease the dialogue,'' he said.

   Following the resignation of the
controversial president of the University of South Carolina, some
legislators called Thursday for strict spending guidelines for his
successor.
   The surprise resignation Wednesday of the university's president,
James B. Holderman, followed weeks of controversy over his spending
during fund-raising drives. He was criticized for using luxury
hotels, chartered jets and chauffeured limousines.
   In announcing his resignation, which is effective July 1,
Holderman didn't refer to the controversy. The 54-year-old
administrator said he was seeking ``new personal and professional
challenges.''
   Some lawmakers said the university should take a lesson from
other Southeastern schools, where less is spent on fund-raising. At
the other universities, presidents enjoy much smaller discretionary
accounts than Holderman's $533,000 personal account, funded by
concessions.
   ``It'll be important for the new president to get out into the
state, to get people to know him and not give the impression that
he's a jet-setter,'' said state Rep. Mike Fair.
   Fair and state Reps. Herb Kirsh and David Beasley said spending
guidelines imposed on Holderman two weeks ago by USC's board of
trustees should be vigorously applied to his successor.
   ``The board needs to have a long, hard, solid meeting to
determine what they are looking for in a president,'' Beasley said.
   Holderman, 54, ran the university since 1977.
   He regularly used luxury hotels on fund-raising trips, hired
$35-an-hour chauffeured limousines in Washington, and chartered jets
or flew first class, according to records from the university and
private foundations affiliated with the school.
   Holderman argued that expensive hotel rooms were necessary to woo
wealthy donors.
   Holderman first came under criticism in 1986 for spending on his
travels, giving expensive gifts to donors and students and paying
top dollar to lure celebrity lecturers and speakers to the school.
   Jihan Sadat, widow of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, was paid
$200,000 to teach a course in Egyptian culture for three semesters
in 1985 and 1986.
   More recently, the school has drawn criticism for paying
actor-director Robby Benson $158,367 to teach filmmaking and $15,600
for rent, with Holderman kicking in $10,000 from his discretionary
fund for travel and moving expenses. Benson announced Thursday he
wasn't renewing his contract and cited Holderman's resignation as
the reason.
   Trustee Charlie G. Williams, state superintendent of education,
said revisions in the powers of the president of the 40,000-student
school have yet to be discussed by the 23 trustees.
   ``The board should look at what other universities are doing in
fund-raising. We should not be so proud as to not look at Clemson;
they're spending modest amounts and raising a lot of money,'' Fair
said.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Wades into Crowd Near White House</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 3 to CORRECT motorcade destination to Soviet

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev waded
into a rush-hour crowd on a downtown Washington sidewalk Thursday,
shaking hands with pedestrians and declaring, ``I feel really at
home.''
   The bystanders cheered and applauded, and some pedestrians
yelled, ``Gorby, over here.'' A few in the crowd waved small
American flags.
   Gorbachev had just concluded his second round of talks with
President Bush when he stopped his motorcade en route from the White
House to the Soviet Embassy. He walked calmly up to the crowd of 500
or more people who had been waiting in hopes of catching a glimpse
of him. After a few seconds on the sidewalk, he walked the street,
trailed by a phalanx of security officials.
   Asked about the summit, Gorbachev told onlookers, ``We want to
further our relationship.''
   He said people ``want a better tomorrow. And the rest,'' he said,
``is not too important.''
   At one point Gorbachev could hardly be seen as the crowd pushed
toward him, most of the men and women holding out their hands.
Gorbachev shook several during the encounter near the corner of
Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street.
   Within a few moments, he was back inside his car on his way to
the Soviet Embassy. Journalists crowded around as word spread of his
stroll.
   Such unscheduled stops have become something of a Gorbachev
trademark. He did much the same thing in 1987 while visiting
Washington.
   On a Canadian stopover in Ottawa earlier this week, Gorbachev
walked through the downtown shopping district for 45 minutes,
shaking hands and chatting with Canadians who rushed to the scene
when they heard broadcast reports he was walking about.
   On Wednesday morning, after laying a wreath at a Canadian war
memorial, Gorbachev and his host, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
left their cars and walked several hundred yards toward Parliament
Hill, making their way through crowds of delighted people.

   Americans in the Middle East or headed there
should be especially careful because of the rising level of violence
in the region, the State Department said on Thursday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in a statement
there have been a number of terrorist incidents in the aftermath of
the murder of eight Palestinians in Israel.
   The latest incident was the attempt Wednesday to launch a
seaborne attack on Israel.
   Ms. Tutwiler also noted that anti-American groups in the region
have publicly threatened to attack American citizens or U.S.
interests.
   Such statements have been issued by leaders of Hezbollah and of
the Palestine Islamic Jihad and by the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine.

   Here is the text of remarks by President Bush
during a toast Thursday night honoring Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev:
   Friends, distinguished guests _ and, especially, Mr. President
and Mrs. Gorbachev: Barbara and I are delighted to welcome you to
the White House _ to share ``bread and salt'' with us on this
special evening.
   We're now nearing the end of a momentous day _ the first of four
in this Washington Summit.
   And here in the White House, Mr. President, we will meet again _
this time to sign our names to a series of agreements that signify
the progress our two nations have made in forging a new
relationship. Agreements on everything from nuclear testing and
chemical weapons _ to expanded contacts between the people of
America and the Soviet Union.
   These agreements are a continuation of all that began in Malta
just six months ago _ a foundation we can build on. Proof that
differences can be resolved _ even while others remain. And let me
assure President Gorbachev _ whatever deep differences divided us in
the past, the United States and the American people approach every
issue with a sincere belief that our two nations can find common
ground. Indeed, because of our unique positions in the world _ we
must find common ground.
   We meet at a time of great and historic change _ in the Soviet
Union, in Europe, and around the world. Such profound change is
unsettling, but also exhilarating. We do not shrink from the
challenges before us but welcome them, determined to build the
foundations of enduring peace and security.
   Mr. President, you deserve great credit for the course you've
chosen _ for the political and economic reforms you've introduced _
and for creating within the Soviet Union a commitment to change. As
I said this morning as I welcomed you to the White House, we want to
see perestrokia succeed _ we want to see this transition now under
way in the Soviet Union maintain its momentum.
   Mr. President, it is said that your country is ``the land of
possibilities.'' You have demonstrated the truth of that statement,
and we've seen this past year that ours is a world of possibilities.
That our time is a time of historic change _ a time when men and
nations can transform history _ can turn possibility into progress,
into peace.
   So let us raise our glasses:
   To our guests, President and Mrs. Gorbachev; to the growing
friendship between the American and Soviet people; and to the
possibilities now open to us _ to the prospect of progress, and
lasting peace.

   When Phoenix builds a Japanese tea garden, it
doesn't fool around. The city has bought 900 tons of rocks, and
wants to put the garden over an interstate.
   Phoenix plans to build the $2.9 million garden and a $400,000
replica of an Irish farmhouse in honor of Himeji, Japan, and Ennis,
Ireland, two of its sister cities.
   The garden and the farmhouse are to be part of Deck Park, planned
for a deck over Interstate 10 downtown. The park is scheduled to
open late next year.
   Architects and landscapers from Himeji picked $14,000 worth of
rocks for the 2{-acre garden.
   ``I don't think they realize how big these rocks are, because by
the time we dug out some of these monsters, they were 8 to 10 feet
across,'' said Dale Longbreak of Red Mountain Mining Co., which
collected the rocks north of Mesa and delivered them Wednesday.
   But sometimes 1,800,000 pounds of rocks isn't enough. The
architects and landscapers want 15 more kinds of rock to make the
garden authentic, said parks official Mike Whiting.

   President Bush was nearly upstaged by summit
guest Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday as he sought to maintain a
low profile while Gorbachev made frequent public appearances and
pronounceents.
   Finally, Bush emerged at the White House in early evening to give
to reporters his side of his two opening day's sessions and his
impressions of the Soviet leaders.
   ``I feel very comfortable with him. I feel very free to bring up
positions I know he doesn't agree with. That hasn't always been the
case. There have been times when people banged their shoes when they
didn't agree. That's not the tone of this meeting,'' Bush said.
   But by the time Bush made his originally unplanned remarks,
Gorbachev had already spoken to a group of American thinkers,
answered questions, and held two impromptu news conferences outside
the White House.
   White House press officials, who had moved their entire operation
out of the White House and to a college gymnasium about a half mile
away, were clearly taken by surprise by Gorbachev's tactics.
   Earlier, Bush quickly got down to business in welcoming remarks
by telling Gorbachev not to ``lose sight of the differences''
between the superpowers and specifying Lithuania as a prime example.
   Although Bush and Gorbachev exchanged cordial and upbeat
greetings at a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the White
House, Bush's remarks were pointed in places.
   But after their initial session, Bush laid low for the afternoon.
Gorbachev, meanwhile, was busy presenting his case.
   Finally, Bush, apparently smoked out by Gorbachev's constant
public comments, echoed the Soviet leaders' comments on their
progress in striving for reaching common ground on the issue of
German unity.
   ``We've got a big agenda,'' Bush said. ``I am convinced that out
of this meeting we will narrow our differences.''
   He described Gorbachev as a man he could talk to. ``When he
talks, I listen. When I talk, he listens. There is no shouting,''
Bush said.
   In his welcoming remarks, Bush referred to the late Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov as ``one of the world's great minds,''
quoted him and declared: ``Sakharov knew that lasting peace and
progress are inseparable from freedom _ that nations will only be
fully safe when all people are fully free.''
   ``The agreements we've reached cannot cause us to lose sight of
some of the differences that remain. Lithuania is one such issue,''
Bush said. ``We believe that good faith dialogue between the Soviet
leaders and representatives of the Baltic people is the proper
approach _ and we hope to see the process go forward.''
   As recently as Wednesday, in Canada, Gorbachev had spoken harshly
of the methods used by the Lithuanians in their independence effort.
   But the Soviet leader, who also had complained about Western
pressure on what he considers an internal problem, did not mention
the rebellious Baltic state in his welcoming remarks.
   Bush called his schedule with Gorbachev ``a working summit in the
strictest sense of the term'' and said they would join in ``an open
and honest search for common ground.''
   Between their opening morning session and a 4 p.m. second
session, the president had no public events scheduled. By contrast,
Ronald Reagan made a number of separate appearances while Gorbachev
was maintaining his own schedule during their summits.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Bush was using the
time to meet with advisers to discuss the first summit session.
``He's also got a country to run,'' Popadiuk said.

<HEAD>Apollo Capsule To Remain in Storage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The charred Apollo capsule in which
three astronauts died 23 years ago will remain in storage in
Virginia rather than be buried in an abandoned missile silo or given
to a museum, NASA said Thursday.
   The capsule was to have been shipped in May from Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va., to its final resting place in a silo at Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station. It was to have been buried on top of
debris from the 1986 Challenger explosion, America's only other
space tragedy.
   The transfer temporarily was halted after curators at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum said they
would like to acquire the capsule as an historic artifact. The
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kan., also had
expressed interest.
   NASA spokesman Mark Hess said the decision to keep the capsule at
Langley indefinitely was made after conferring with relatives of the
three astronauts who died and former Apollo astronauts.
   ``They just asked us to reconsider and keep it, or store it in
another way,'' Hess said.
   Displaying the capsule at the Smithsonian or anywhere else was
never seriously considered, Hess said.
   ``I don't think you'd find a soul in NASA who thought that was an
appropriate alternative,'' he said.
   Mike Stephenson, associate director of the Kansas Cosmosphere and
Space Center, said he's pleased the capsule will not be buried in
the silo. His museum had been interested in the capsule _ and still
would be _ for memorial purposes rather than for display.
   ``It's certainly important that the artifact be preserved,''
Stephenson said.
   The capsule has been stored in a locked container at Langley
since the 1967 fire, which claimed the lives of astronauts Virgil
``Gus'' Grissom, Roger B. Chaffee and Edward H. White II. It briefly
was removed a few weeks ago so its heat shield could be cut into
pieces for shipping.
   The astronauts died when fire engulfed the capsule during a
countdown rehearsal for the first manned Apollo mission. The fire,
in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen, was triggered by a spark
when a broken or bruised wire beneath Grissom's couch contacted
metal.
   Thirty-one cartons of hardware and investigative material were
moved to Kennedy Space Center in late April for burial with the
capsule. They will be returned to Langley.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
comments to reporters Thursday after his second meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush: ``Well, I'd just say at the end of a very interesting day
that the talks have gone reasonably well. The mood is very positive
in the sense that I had a very good, and I mean genuinely, not in a
diplomatic sense, very good exchange, for a couple of hours this
morning with President Gorbachev. I'm very well pleased with the
ground we covered.
   ``This afternoon's meeting, the tone was positive. Differences
remain. We talked about the German question there. I believe
President Gorbachev indicated after the meeting that he didn't think
the whole question of Germany would be resolved. Certainly we're not
in any position to resolve that entire question. But when he said
that the differences were ... had been narrowed somewhat, I'm taking
some heart from that and we'll continue these discussions tomorrow.
   ``But I think, given the difficulties of some of the problems we
face, the talks have gone certainly as well as I could have expected
up to now, and we still have a lot of discussion. But we've touched
on almost every contentious issue, as well as spelling out the areas
in which we have common interests and where things are going very
well between us.
   ``So, that's a report for tonight, and tomorrow I'll be able to
say a little bit more. But I won't go into details that we've agreed
we're not going to talk about.''
   Q: ``None of us understand why you can't sign a trade agreement
if it's all wrapped up.''
   Bush: ``Well, we haven't said whether we can sign a trade
agreement or not, yet.''
   Q: ``Why?''
   Bush: ``Will get ... we haven't discussed that yet.''
   Q: ``(Inaudible) ... instructed the foreign ministers to discuss
something that emerged today about Germany, sir. Could you tell us
about that?''
   Bush: ``No, because we agreed we wouldn't. We agreed we'd let
them discuss it ...''
   Q: ``Will you confirm that ...''
   Bush: ``... and I will say I think ... I think when I heard what
President Gorbachev said, that is exactly what we agreed he would
talk about. So, we're just going to stay with that guidance.''
   Q: ``When will they meet ...''
   Bush: ``I don't know, probably tomorrow, probably tomorrow.''
   Q: ``Was there some narrowing of differences that made you decide
the foreign ministers should get together with some specific details
you have them working on?''
   Bush: ``Well, that was a proposal that President Gorbachev made,
and I think the foreign ministers need to discuss in great detail
the subjects we discussed to see. But I was ... I took ... I must
say, Michael, I took some heart from that. I was encouraged by that.
Our position has been stated and restated, and we'll see where we go.
   ``But I think the important point is we could talk very frankly,
no rancor there, and let's hope some of the differences have been
narrowed. But, when he says this whole German question will not be
solved at a meeting of this nature, I would agree with that. We
consult our allies, and we don't ... and he knows that. He knows
that we have a lot of consultation. But, basically, my position is
the same as it was when we went into the meetings. But I'm listening
very carefully, listening to their views and trying to understand
their positions.''
   Q: ``Did you offer something specific for the foreign ministers
to discuss on Germany?'' Bush: ``I think they do have some specifics
to discuss, but there's ... that can be discussed after they get
through talking about those things.''
   Q: ``Mr. President, did you offer any concessions. Did you ...''
   Bush: ``No, I want to stay with the guidance that we agreed on,
but I ... our position is well known and the fundamentals have not
changed. The fundamentals have not changed.''
   Q: ``Has he taken offense to your stand on Lithuania or your
remarks today at the welcoming ceremony?''
   Bush: ``He didn't seem to take offense to anything. He knows that
we had differences. I've been very up-front with him, and he's been
very, very direct and up-front with me. So, that's one of the good
things about the meeting. When great powers have differences,
sometimes they haven't been able to talk about them in a civil way.
We are talking about them in a very civil way, and I commend him for
that approach. It's one I like, it's one I understand and it's one I
think benefits not just the United States and the Soviet Union but a
lot of other countries as well.''
   Q: ``Would a trade bill be contingent on what you hear on
Lithuania?''
   Bush: ``Well, we're going to discuss the details of that ...
probably get into some of that tomorrow.''
   Q: ``Do he feel like you have a better understanding on about ...
on Germany, being that he's more ready to come your way than you are
to his?''
   Bush: ``We're not dealing on that. Look, we agreed to some
guidance, he and I, and I'm going to stick with it, and he did. And
I think that's a good sign. We're in the middle of some discussions
about where it stands.''

   Q: ``Why do you think that it's going so well? Both of you have
talked about a really good relationship that the two of you in the
talks, the hours you've spent. Why do you think this time there has
been such a ... is it a good chemistry?''
   Bush: ``Well, I don't know. It's a good question and I feel very
comfortable with him. I feel very free to bring up positions that I
know he doesn't agree with, and as I've said that hasn't always been
the case. There've been times when people banged their shoes when
they didn't agree. And we don't ... that's not the mood or the tone
of this meeting. And we have both realized we're engaged in very,
very historic and important work here.
   ``And I think his ... I think when these meetings are over the
people in this country are going to be pleased with some of the
positions he takes concerning U.S. interests. And, hopefully I can
be reassuring to the people in the Soviet Union about the kind of
relationship we want. So the tone of it is important so that we can
try to quote, narrow differences, unquote.''
   Q: ``Mr. President, does either side have a better understanding
of the other's position on Lithuania now? Have you narrowed any
differences?''
   Bush: ``That subject has been dicussed but not in the plenary
meetings and not in great detail yet. It will certainly be discussed
in much more detail.''
   Q: ``(Inaudible) ... your discussion on Germany. Was there any
similar encourage around Lithuania?''
   Bush: ``As I say, that matter has not been discussed, and I can't
quantify for you my hopes one each important question and that is an
important question.''
   Q: ``Mr. President, have you backed off anything since his
comments yesterday about dictating to the Soviets?''
   Bush: ``I don't recall ... you mean something he said in Canada?''
   Q: ``Yes, sir.''
   Bush: ``Well, I think when I said out there that we're dealing
from positions of unique responsibility, I think he understood that
I have a certain respect for the standing of the Soviet Union and
I'm not attempting to dictate. I'm ... but I clearly am entitled to
and will put forward the views of the American side as forcefully as
I can.
   ``But you don't get any progress if you ... if you give the
impression that you're in a situation of dictation. The age of the
dictator is over. Don't you remember my speech here a while back?''
   Q: ``Well, Mulroney seems to think that you're ... most of the
West is insensitive to what the Soviets suffered in World War II.''
   Bush: ``I think Mulroney, with whom I've talked twice in the last
two days, knows very well that the United States is not insensitive
to the fact that the Soviets lost 27 million lives in a war, and I
know Mr. Gorbachev understands that I'm quite sensitive to that.
   ``I think he's also sensitive to the fact that a lot of American
kids lost their lives. I reminded him that I was the only one of the
two of us that was old enough to remember it from being there.''
   Q: ``That's why he doesn't want Germany in NATO.''
   Bush: ``Well, you're putting words into his mouth.''
   Q: ``Do you have enough time in three days, or is that too
   short a period of time?''
   Bush: ``Well, I don't know. I think the Camp David meeting where
we have a lot of one-on-one time is going to be fruitful. I think
the ... I think we've got to do better on simultaneous as opposed to
consecutive translations to speed things up and today we ... in the
Oval Office, we had the ... we had the longer version. So I'd like
to move that up a little bit. But I guess there's never enough time
when you're dealing with an agenda that is this important.
   ``We've got regional questions that we haven't touched on yet. We
have more refinement on ... each side to refine its views on the
European questions. We have arms control that's still being talked
about behind the scenes but that he and I have not gone into. So
we've got a big agenda. And whether we'll have enough time to do
everything that he wants and that I want, I don't know. I am
convinced that out of this meeting we will narrow differences and
that two ships are less apt to pass in the night based on simple
misunderstanding. And I'm convinced of that, because I can talk very
frankly with him. And when he talks, I listen. And when I talk, he
listens. We're not shouting at each other. There's not a rancor in
there.
   ``And once in a while both of us ... we feel strongly about
something, we might get a little more passionate than the rest of
the time in presenting our views. But I'm very pleased with that
mood of wanting to ... his wanting to understand the United States'
position, my having an opportunity to discuss it. And I hope he
understand the receptivity on my part.''

   Q: ``Mr. President, may I try once more on the question of
Germany?''
   Bush: ``You can try, but I'm not going to give you any more,
because we agreed with the President of the Soviet Union on a
guidance ... if you want me to read it to you again, I'll get my
notes out, but I can't help you on it. Nice try. Another question,
though, maybe.''
   Q: ``Mr. President, have you noticed a change in the Soviet
President since Malta? Have his domestic problems constrained him at
all in your talks?''
   Bush: ``He's six months older. No, I don't really ... I don't
...''
   Q: ``Has he brought up his own domestic problems and offered that
as a stumbling block to any solutions?''
   Bush: ``No, no. He's not done that. He's not trying to hide
anything, nor is he wringing his hands. To me there is a certain ...
and I don't know if his friends felt this way ... but a certain
strength and confidence that was there in Malta and is certainly
still there now. And you could feel that. I mean, this wasn't just a
casual observation. You ... I felt strongly about that. So I don't
feel a weakened presence or anything of that nature. I feel a man
determined to do his job.''
   Q: ``Do you think there's anything you can or should do to help
him in the short term?''
   Bush: ``Well, I think I'm going to do what's in the national
interest of the United States, our security interests, our global
interests. And working closely with the Soviet Union ... a lot of
questions ... is in our interest. And so with that approach in mind
I think maybe we can ... he can go away feeling that he's got people
here that are not just dealing from some innate animosity towards
the Soviet Union.
   ``We're in a fantastic era of change. And we focus on the
problems at meetings like this, but we ought not to neglect the fact
that we're sitting here talking to the head of the Soviet Union at a
time when Eastern Europe for the most part enjoys the democratic
process and enjoys a freedom that none of us would have predicted
possible. And a lot of that is because of the way in which Mr.
Gorbachev has conducted himself.
   ``So, there's some problems out there, but we ought not to
overlook the fact that we've come a long, long way. And there is
less tension in terms of world catastrophe, but there's still some
big problems. So it's that kind of an approach that I'm bringing to
these meetings.''
   Q: ``Sir, was there any progress today on START or CFE?''
   Bush: ``Well, that's going on but not ... it didn't come up ...
the arms control agenda was not discussed today.''
   Q: ``Do you think you're going to Moscow?''
   Bush: ``Huh?''
   Q: ``Do you think he'll invite you to Moscow?''
   Bush: ``Eventually.''
   Q: ``Did you watch him out of the car, sir?''
   Bush: ``Eventually. Huh?''
   Q: ``Did you watch him when he get out of the car down there on
15th Street?''
   Bush: ``No, I didn't see that.''
   Q: ``A big crowd.''
   Bush: ``Was it?''
   Q: ``A big crowd, yes. I think he's taking your advice about
   parades.''
   Bush: ``(Chuckling.) How was it received?''
   Q: ``When he left he indicated that he was hoping there would be
more in-depth discussion. Were there in-depth discussions today?''
   Bush: ``I thought they were in-depth. I thought ...''
   Q: ``He didn't seem to ...''
   Bush: ``Well, I don't know ... I think he thinks they were
in-depth.'' (Chuckles.)
   Q: ``Did you talk with him about the handshaking out on the
street?'' (Inaudible.)
   Bush: ``No, we didn't. We didn't discuss that.''
   Q: ``You didn't really settle anything today.''
   Q: ``Did you come out here because you feared ... (inaudible) ...
won the game and he was getting all the publicity by ...''
   Bush: ``Michael, I knew you'd want ... (laughter) ... I knew
you'd want a debriefing. (Laughter.) You know how I'm jealous about
air time. It's terrible. (Laughter.) You know how I am. I'll see you
guys ... you've got to stop laughing.'' (Laughter.)

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos
collapsed and coughed up blood Thursday during her federal
racketeering trial and was taken by ambulance to a hospital.
   Mrs. Marcos, who twice in the last month had fallen ill with high
blood pressure, was carried out on a stretcher, an oxygen mask on
her face, and was taken to New York Hospital.
   Tests showed evidence of bleeding in her stomach, said Jonathan
Weil, a hospital spokesman. Her condition was listed as stable.
   He said doctors concluded that she has erosive gastritis, a
condition in which acid produced by the stomach erodes the organ's
lining.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, was treated with intravenous medication to
suppress the production of acid, Weil said.
   ``It is expected that she will be in the hospital for several
days until her condition, which is not life-threatening, has
improved,'' he said.
   The spokesman said Mrs. Marcos was ``alert, conscious, awake and
not excessively in pain.''
   The condition wasn't thought to be related to the blood pressure
problem, said Dr. David Case, an internist who has been treating
Mrs. Marcos for high blood pressure.
   Asked if the problem could be stress-related, he said, ``It could
be.''
   The incident occurred just as Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerry
Spence, completed cross examining a witness.
   Mrs. Marcos began coughing into a black handkerchief and then
slumped forward in her chair.
   ``I heard a deep groan and she passed out on the table,'' Spence
said.
   Jurors watched as her lawyers and supporters rushed to her aid.
U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan quickly excused the jurors until
Tuesday and cleared the courtroom.
   An attorney for Mrs. Marcos, Benjamin Cassiday, said that she was
``gagging on her own blood'' and that her doctor, who was in
attendance, instructed aides to hold her head up as he administered
to her.
   ``When I saw her face and throwing up blood, I thought she was
going to die,'' Cassiday said.
   According to James Linn, attorney for Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant,
Adnan Khashoggi, Mrs. Marcos hemorrhaged from her nose and mouth as
she fell forward and clutched her left hand to the side of her head.
   ``It was terrible. I never saw so much blood come out of
someone,'' Khashoggi said.
   Linn, who was sitting with his client about 8 feet from Mrs.
Marcos, said she appeared to have fainted. Others said she
apparently was not fully conscious as she was taken from the
courtroom to the nurse's office.
   Since her first attack on April 26, Mrs. Marcos has worn a
special blood pressure monitoring device that intermittenly buzzes.
She was wearing it on Thursday when she collapsed.
   ``If she's not well enough to participate in her own defense and
if the doctors don't think she's well enough, I won't let her back
for all the tea in China,'' said another Marcos lawyer, John Bartko.
   Mrs. Marcos has been on trial since March 20 on charges of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of
justice.
   She is accused of having helped her late husband, former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, steal more than $220 million
from their country's treasury to buy four New York buildings and
artwork.
   Khashoggi is charged with fraud and obstructing justice for
allegedly faking documents to show that he owned the real estate and
paintings.
   ``I think the agony of a lengthy, drawn-out trial is taking its
toll on her as it has on all of us,'' Cassiday said.
   Family members at the hospital included Mrs. Marcos' daughter,
Irene, her sister-in-law, Fortuna Barba, and her step-sister, a nun,
Sister Bellarmine.
   Her illness came one day after Mrs. Marcos became upset when the
judge angrily rebuked Spence in front of the jury.
   Mrs. Marcos had appeared close to tears as Spence and Keenan had
a heated exchange about whether the attorney had made misleading
statements to the jury.

   The Justice Department said Thursday it is
seeking a court order to enjoin Stewart Sandwiches Inc. of Norfolk,
Va. from making and distributing sandwiches until it complies with
federal health laws.
   The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Norfolk charges
that Stewart made sandwiches containing potentially life-threatening
bacteria.
   Stewart, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of
sandwiches sold in vending machines and convenience stores, is
accused in the lawsuit of failing to control bacteria contamination
at its plant in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   ``We will not tolerate any threat to the purity of this nation's
food suypply,'' said Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general in
charge of the Civil Division.
   There was no answer at company headquarters in Norfolk.
   The department said the Food and Drug Administration received a
complaint April 12 from Florida authorities that bacteria had been
found in a sandwich made by Stewart and sold in that state.
   The same day, the FDA received a complaint from Louisiana
officials that sandwiches shipped to that state were also
contaminated, the department said.
   Two private test laboratories hired by Stewart also found
bacteriological contamination during an inspection of the company's
cooked food section in April, the department said.
   Three inspections in 1989 by the FDA found unsanitary conditions
and evidence of bacteria, the department said.
   The complaint also asks injunctions against Stewart's president,
Theodore J. Broecker, and Donald R. Beard, senior vice president.

   The Brand family scurried Thursday to
get the farm spruced up for some special guests: Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa.
   ``I'll clean the house if I have time,'' said Cecilia Brand, who
learned Wednesday that the Russians might be coming to the farm
about 20 miles south of Minneapolis.
   ``This was a total surprise,'' said Mrs. Brand, 54. ``... I'm
excited _ and nervous.''
   It wasn't certain the Gorbachevs would visit the farm during
their stop in Minnesota on Sunday. But Mrs. Brand said she'd been
told the Soviet president would probably arrive that evening after
meeting with business and agricultural leaders in Minneapolis.
   ``We think of ours as a typical American farm and want to convey
what American farm life is like,'' Mrs. Brand said as she stopped to
relax for a few minutes during a hectic Thursday.
   The Brands were trying to keep up with their chores and field
work as they clean the barn and other areas and mow the lawn.
   If the weather is nice, the Brands would like to sit around the
picnic table in their large yard and talk with the Gorbachevs,
telling them about their family and the farm.
   If it's rainy, the visit will be around the kitchen table.
   ``We want to welcome them here,'' Mrs. Brand said. ``This is our
opportunity to promote some little bit of international
understanding.''
   Mrs. Brand and her 58-year-old husband, Richard, have a large
dairy operation, milking about 75 cows. Their total herd, including
calves and animals that will be sold for beef, numbers about 250.
   They also raise alfalfa, corn and soybeans on their 240-acre farm
and additional acres that they rent, and sell seed corn. And about
20 to 25 cats prowl the property.
   The Brands have farmed their land for 32 years. They're helped by
sons, Greg, 31, and John, 27, who both live nearby.
   The Brands aren't strangers to the job of entertaining foreign
visitors, and think that may be one reason they were chosen as
potential hosts to the Gorbachevs.
   ``We do have a lot of foreign people who come here. We've had
several Chinese and Japanese and quite a few European groups,'' Mrs.
Brand said. She speculated that the farm's closeness to the Twin
Cities could help explain why state officials frequently steer
visitors her way.
   However, a Gorbachev visit would be far different.
   ``Security will be very, very tight,'' Mrs. Brand said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
his wife, Raisa, will get a gourmet taste of Minnesota at Sunday's
lunch at the governor's mansion, chefs say.
   Twin Cities writers and business people got a preview Wednesday
night of the meal the Gorbachevs, Gov. Rudy Perpich, his wife, Lola,
and 46 other people will be served during the Soviet leader's
Minnesota visit.
   Before the meal, they will enjoy hors d'oeuvres including corn
cakes with smoked salmon, creme fraiche and caviar and Minnesota
cheese puffs.
   The first course will feature pecan-breaded walleye from Rainy
Lake in northern Minnesota with artichokes, smoked tomatoes and
local garden greens.
   The main course is veal medallions, with a Minnesota wild
rice-corn compote and a sauce of Minnesota morels.
   ``The walleye is a family favorite. We do a lot of seafood and
veal,'' Mrs. Perpich said.
   The dessert is minted sweet biscuits, with early summer berries,
cream and caramel.
   Chardonnay wines from California will be served with the
appetizers and first course, a California Cabernet Sauvignon with
the veal and a white dessert wine with the berries.
   General Mills and Pillsbury are underwriting the cost of the meal.

   The United States and the Soviet Union will
sign an agreement increasing by nearly four-fold the number of
commercial flights between U.S. and Soviet cities, the White House
announced Thursday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the airline
agreement was one of a series of agreements that would be signed by
U.S. and Soviet officials on Friday at the White House.
   Others include new pacts on ocean studies, maritime cooperation
and cultural exchanges.
   The new airline agreement _ to be signed by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze _
would enable Soviet citizens for the first time to use rubles to buy
tickets on U.S. airlines.
   That will open up travel to many Soviet citizens who do not have
access to U.S. dollars or other easily-convertible currencies with
which to purchase tickets. The Soviet ruble generally cannot be
exchanged for other forms of currency.
   Under the agreement, Soviet airlines would serve as a middleman
in selling such tickets to Soviet travelers. The pact calls for up
to 8.75 percent of tickets on any given flight to be made available
to purchasers with rubles.
   The pact would increase from the current four to 14 U.S. and
Soviet cities served. Now, flights are allowed only between Moscow,
Leningrad, Washington and New York.
   Total passenger and cargo flights per side will increase from
under eight at present to 15 immediately; to 42 by next April and to
58 by April, 1992.
   An ocean studies agreement, also to be signed by Baker and
Shevardnadze, calls for shared use of research vessels and a ``broad
range of oceanographic research cooperation,'' according to a White
House fact sheet.
   A more-modest U.S.-Soviet joint effort to explore the oceans was
suspended by the United States with the 1979 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   Another agreement, to be signed by Shevardnadze and U.S.
Transportation Scretary Samuel Skinner, seeks to put U.S.-Soviet
maritime relations on a more normal footing _ including increased
access to each other's ports.
   Agreements will also be signed by other administration officials
and Shevardnadze on cultural centers, customs cooperation and
distribution of the magazines intended for each other's country,
Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>500 Contras Disarm After Latest Accord With Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicargua (AP) </DATELINE>

   Nearly 500 Contra rebels surrendered
their weapons on the first day of a renewed disarmament agreement, a
United Nations spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman, Fernando Castanon, said the disarmament of 498
guerrillas from five security zones brings to 2,482 the number of
rebels who have demobilized since the process began May 8. About
11,500 remain in the security zones policed by U.N. forces.
   Also Thursday, the United States turned over to Nicaragua $60
million, the first payment of $300 million in aid approved by
Congress. John Leonard, charges d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy,
presented the check to Foreign Minister Enrique Dreyfus. The
Nicaraguan economy is in serious financial straits.
   The rebels agreed Wednesday to renew the demobilization process
and to disarm the entire Contra army by a previously agreed-to
deadline of June 10.
   In return the government agreed to provide more than 20
``development zones in combat areas where Contras and their families
can settle. It provides them with their own police forces and with
voices in local town councils and government ministries aiding in
the resettlement.
   The rebels will get title to land and be given priority in
getting compensation for property confiscated by the former
Sandinista government.
   The Contras agreed to demobilize at least 100 rebels from each
zone daily, although they will have to double that rate to meet the
June 10 deadline.
   The latest agreement is one of a number reached between the
Contras and the government of President Violetta Barrios de Chamorro.
   The demobilization process was stopped by the Contras once after
a series of crippling strikes by the public sector in which the
Sandinista-led strikers got virtually everything they wanted.
   The Contras said this made them worry about the stability of the
government in the face of the Sandinista opposition.
   The Contras, with American backing, fought the leftist Sandinista
regime for nine of the 10 years it held power in a war that cost
about 30,000 lives.
   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada said Thursday that the
government gave the Contras too much.
   It said the deal lacks ``an obligatory clause that offers the
citizenry guarantees on the disarmament of the Contras.''
   Mrs. Chamorro said Wednesday that Gen. Humberto Ortega, the
former Sandinista defense minister who remains in charge of the
army, will develop a plan to reduce the army's size after the
Contras have disarmed.
   Her retention of Ortega, brother of former Sandinista President
Daniel Ortega, also has been a point of controversy among the
Contras and one of a number of pressures on her new administration.

^Gorbachevs to White House for Glittering State Dinner</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winning actors, media moguls and
political luminaries joined President Bush on Thursday in honoring
Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev with a glittering evening of Maine
lobster and opera arias.
   As the guests settled into the White House's State Dining Room
for the capital's biggest social event of the year, the two
president praised one another warmly for the tone of their summit
talks.
   In his formal toast, Bush lauded the Soviet president ``for
creating within the Soviet Union this commitment to change.''
   ``Mr. President,'' Bush told his counterpart, ``it is said that
your country is the land of possibilities. You have demonstrated the
truth of that statement, and we've seen this past year that ours is
a world of possibilities, that ours is a time of historic change, a
time when men and nations can transform history.''
   For his part, Gorbachev said the days are gone when the Soviet
Union considered the United States an enemy.
   ``The enemy image is becoming a thing of the past. Ideological
stereotypes are fading away,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, wearing his glasses and speaking somberly through most
of the toast, held out hope that this summit meeting would yield
``the biggest results,'' of any previous Soviet-U.S. summit.
   ``I cannot say yet how we are going to conclude this meeting,
what the results will be. That would be premature,'' he said. But
based on the talks Thursday, he said it was ``possible to expect
major results from this meeting.''
   ``Maybe I'm too optimistic but let's wait and see, we have two
days,'' he said to applause.
   The White House was decked out in white peonies and red roses,
with President Johnson's flower-edged china set on the tables and
the grand entrance foyer decorated in red and pink, 12-foot geranium
trees.
   The Gorbachevs arrived for the black-tie gala evening dressed
simply, Soviet style _ the Russian president in a dark business
suit, Mrs. Gorbachev in a tea-length black, pink and green floral
dress with a flowing skirt.
   They stepped from their limousine onto the red carpet at the
White House front steps where they were greeted by the tuxedo-clad
American president and his wife Barbara, who wore a sapphire blue
gown, with fitted bodice and sweeping skirt.
   For the state dinner during Gorbachev's 1987 visit to Washington,
then-President Ronald Reagan also dressed in a business suit, so as
not to outshine his guest. Soviet leaders traditionally do not wear
black tie, considering it an elite dress style.
   Bush and his wife Barbara put a personal touch on Thursday
night's menu, serving lobster from their longtime summer vacation
state, Maine.
   And, in light of the Soviet fondness for opera, they enlisted one
of the world's foremost mezzo-sopranos, Frederica von Stade, to sing
for the guests in the East Room following dinner.
   Tables were done in red tablecloth with white napkins, with
crystal bowls on mirror plateaus filled with white peonies, white
ixia and red roses.
   Complementing the lobster served en gelee, the menu for the
evening featured corn sticks, roasted filet of beef mascotte with
green peppercorn sauce, asparagus with sauce aveline, mixed salad,
Saint Pauline cheese, and dessert of lime turban with iced
raspberries and friandises candies.
   Guests invited to mingle with the Soviet Union's first couple and
other members of their entourage included former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and industrialist Armand Hammer, who has conducted
business in the Soviet Union for many years.
   Also holding coveted tickets to the dinner were such celebrities
as Academy-Award winning actor Jessica Tandy; Tandy's husband, Hume
Cronyn; Academy Award nominee Morgan Freeman; NBC news anchor Tom
Brokaw and evangelist Billy Graham. Tandy and Freeman starred
together in last year's Academy Award best picture ``Driving Miss
Daisy.''
   Tandy and Graham sat at the president's table with Mrs. Gorbachev.
   Among those joining Mrs. Bush at the Soviet president's table was
Freeman.
   Others who made the list of invitees, in addition to various
Cabinet members and administration officials, were: Bush's son Neil
and his wife Sharon of Denver; The New York Times Chairman Arthur
Ochs Sulzberger and Washington Post Publisher Donald Graham; Time
Magazine columnist Hugh Sidey; Los Angeles movie mogul Jerry
Weintraub; Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold Poling; National Urban
League president John Jacob and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
   Congressional leaders also were invited.
   As a side note to the festivities, the Gorbachevs and Bushes
exchanged the customary official gifts. The president chose to give
Gorbachev a five-volume biography, ``Life of George Washington,'' by
Chief Justice John Marshall. The Soviet leader's present for Bush
was an antique painting of Russian birch trees.
   Mrs. Bush chose an elegant Judith Leiber
gold-and-rhinestone-trimmed handbag for Raisa Gorbachev. Mrs.
Gorbachev presented Mrs. Bush with a decorative enameled tea set.
   For table settings, Barbara Bush decided to use the flower-edged
china bought during President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
She selected that setting over place settings that Nancy Reagan
bought after deciding the Johnson dishes were not elegant enough for
a state dinner.
   During dessert, the Air Force strolling strings orchestra were on
tap to play for the dinner guests, and the Marine orchestra tuned up
for music in the grand entrance hall for after-dinner dancing.

<HEAD>Girl Testifies She Was Raped by Buckey But Remembers Little Else</HEAD>

   A 13-year-old girl testified Thursday that
Raymond Buckey raped and molested her while she was a pupil at the
McMartin Pre-School 10 years ago, and cut the ears off a rabbit to
keep her silent.
   The last of three child witnesses in Buckey's retrial also said
he squeezed birds to death to scare her into silence.
   But the girl said she could remember nothing else about the years
she attended the family-owned Manhattan Beach preschool.
   Most of her answers on cross-examination were, ``I don't
remember,'' and she flatly denied accusations she made against
Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, during her testimony in the
case five years ago.
   Under questioning by Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero, the
girl said Buckey molested her while playing ``the horsey game'' in a
classroom at the preschool.
   Buckey, 32, is charged with raping the girl and using a finger to
rape and sodomize her.
   Under cross-examination by Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, the
girl said both she and Buckey were naked during the incident.
   ``... In a classroom on a regular school day?'' Davis asked
incredulously.
   ``Yes,'' said the girl.
   She acknowledged that she didn't remember Buckey being her
teacher nor did she remember who any of her teachers were.
   The defense has said Buckey didn't teach at the school from 1979
to 1981, when the girl attended. Witnesses have said he may have
been a teacher's helper for part of the time.
   The witness, who was serious and composed, said she remembered
Buckey cutting off the ears of one or more rabbits with a scissors.
In earlier testimony she has said he used a knife. Pressed by Davis
for more details she said she could not remember.
   ``He said that he would hurt my parents if I told,'' she said.
   ``If you told what?'' asked Davis.
   ``What happened to me,'' said the girl.
   She denied that Buckey's mother ever molested her. Davis read to
the girl her own previous sworn statements that Mrs. Buckey had used
her finger to rape and sodomize her. Asked if that happened, she
answered, ``No.''
   Mrs. Buckey was acquitted of these and other molestation charges
earlier this year.
   The first Buckey trial, the longest and costliest criminal
proceeding in U.S. history, ended in January with Buckey acquitted
of 40 counts of molestation and his mother acquitted of 12 charges.
But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey, and the
district attorney decided to retry him on eight of those charges
involving three children.
   Prosecutors said they plan to rest their case Friday.

<TEXT>
   Two Colombians and a New Yorker, captured in
Canada's largest drug bust, were found guilty Thursday for
conspiring to traffic cocaine worth about $200 million.
   The three face a maximum life sentence. Sentencing is scheduled
for Monday.
   Moments before the jury's verdict was announced, Ricardo Delgado
Marquez, 24, of New York, and Colombians Fernando William Mendoza
Salazar, 27, and Flor E. Mery-Correa, 32, were seen laughing in the
prisoners' box.
   The jury of nine men and three women deliberated for 15 days
before reaching its verdict.
   The three were arrested April 1989 after undercover police
intercepted a shipment of 1,100 pounds of cocaine flown from
Colombia to Montreal and replaced most of the drug with brown sugar
in an elaborate sting operation.
   Ms. Mery-Correa was found guilty of conspiracy to traffic in
cocaine and possession for the purpose of trafficking. She was
acquitted of conspiring to import and export the narcotic.
   Delgado-Marquez and Mendoza-Salazar were convicted of conspiring
to export and traffic cocaine and possession for the purpose of
trafficking, but were acquitted of conspiracy to import.

   The NAACP agreed to drop a lawsuit against
former staff attorneys who it alleged kept more than $2 million in
fees illegally, the organization said Thursday.
   A statement issued by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People gave no details on the disposition of
the fees.
   It said only that an agreement was reached with former NAACP
general counsel Nathaniel Jones, who is now a judge on the Sixth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   NAACP President Benjamin Hooks said in the statement the dispute
was ``an honest difference of opinion as to how these fees should be
distributed.''
   A lawsuit pending in Cleveland was being dismissed as part of the
agreement, the statement said. Others besides Jones were parties to
the case, but the statement did not mention them and the NAACP
office did not answer a telephone call seeking clarification.
   The legal fees resulted from five discrimination cases dating to
1970.

   President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
grappled over terms of German unity after an opening round of
summitry Thursday that set the stage for major agreements on
chemical and nuclear weapons. Overall, Bush declared, ``The mood is
very positive.''
   The two leaders began their talks proclaiming a new era of
cooperation in spite of their differences. ``The trenches of the
Cold War are disappearing,'' Gorbachev said.
   Bush saluted Gorbachev's leadership in a tacit boost for his
plunging popularity at home, and vowed to end ``decades of division
and discord.''
   After nearly five hours of discussions, Bush and Gorbachev
readily acknowledged they could not settle nettlesome questions this
week over the shape of conventional forces in Europe or the military
bearing of a unified Germany.
   ``It is not here that the German question will be resolved,'' the
Soviet president told reporters. Separately, Bush said, ``Certainly
we're not going to solve the whole issue at this summit.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will take up the issue next week in Copenhagen
during a meeting of the 35-nation European Security Conference.
   There was confusion over whether the superpowers were making any
progress on Germany. Gorbachev said at one point that both sides had
advanced ``certain ideas, certain suggestions,'' and White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``new ideas'' amounted ``to a
way to meld the concerns of the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   But several hours later, a U.S. official told reporters, ``There
are no new ideas,'' and let it be known that Bush would call West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and reassure him of Bush's fidelity to
the new Germany's membership in the west's NATO alliance. Gorbachev
favors some formula that guarantees a renewed German militarism.
   The impasse didn't stay the leaders from providing an upbeat view
of the summit, Bush said, ``I'd just say at the end of a very
interesting day that the talks have gone reasonably well.''
   Gorbachev _ who told a State Dinner audience that ``the enemy
image is becoming a thing of the past''_ sprinkled the day with a
series of unexpected appearances that have become his trademark.
   As he did during his 1987 visit to Washington, Gorbachev
delighted a downtown crowd by hopping out of his limousine and
shaking hands. The throng of about 500 people cheered and applauded.
``Gorby, over here!'' some shouted.
   Twice, he made a beeline to reporters waiting in the White House
driveway for impromptu news conferences.
   After largely ceding the limelight to Gorbachev during the day,
Bush made an unscheduled appearance in the Rose Garden to respond to
questions. ``The talks have certainly gone as well as I could have
expected up to now,'' he said.
   The White House said agreements would be signed Friday ending
production of chemical weapons and sealing the major elements of a
treaty to slash long-range nuclear arms. The leaders will also
commit themselves to deeper cuts in the years ahead.
   Hopes faded for progress on reducing tanks and troops in Europe,
an issue intertwined with the thornier question of German unity.
   Bush said he spoke frankly with Gorbachev. ``He didn't seem to
take offense at anything. ... I feel very comfortable with him. I
feel very free to bring up positions that I know he doesn't agree
with,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev said he and Bush ``understand each other's concerns
better.''

<HEAD>Prosecution Agrees Mom Insane; No Charges in Toddler Stranglings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother accused of strangling her two
toddlers while they slept will not be tried for the killings because
prosecutors say they have no way to disprove that she was insane at
the time.
   Dorothy Diane Rose has been hospitalized since the January
slayings and apparently still believes her 13-month-old daughter and
2-year-old son are alive. Eight defense and two state psychiatrists
agree she was legally insane.
   ``The prosecution doesn't have any evidence to dispute or refute
that finding of insanity,'' Assistant State Attorney John Skye told
a judge Wednesday.
   When Ms. Rose's case is called up for trial Monday on two counts
of first-degree murder, prosecutors say they will agree she should
be found innocent by reason of insanity.
   That doesn't mean the 31-year-old woman will go free. With an
acquittal because of insanity, Circuit Judge M. William Graybill
will retain control and must decide whether to have her committed
indefinitely.
   Ms. Rose has been under psychiatric care since Jan. 23 when
deputies found her near death from a self-inflicted stab wound to
the chest and slashed wrists. Her daughter, Jessica Linn Rose, and
son, Michael Holt Rose, had been strangled in their beds.
   Detectives believe Ms. Rose, who was involved in a bitter
divorce, killed her children to prevent their father from winning
custody. Some psychiatrists have speculated that she thought she was
saving them from an abusive situation.
   ``Where are my children? Where are my children?'' Ms. Rose asked
on a videotape made by defense attorneys a day after the killings.
   In addition to the psychiatrists, friends, neighbors and law
enforcement officers all agreed Ms. Rose was insane, attorneys said.
   ``We have no bad feelings against her although it was a terrible
tragedy,'' father-in-law Donald Rose said Wednesday. ``I think we'll
get over it, but we'll never forget it.''

   A university Thursday let members of a bankrupt
Soviet circus move into a dormitory after a motel evicted the troupe
for not paying their bills.
   Promoters of the Great Circus Bim Bom, meanwhile, tried to set up
new shows in Kentucky to save the tour.
   The circus has been stranded in Georgia since May 9, when
financial problems stalled the first leg of its two-year tour around
the country.
   Earlier this week, a motel in Marietta, north of Atlanta, evicted
the 125 performers after they were unable to pay a bill of more than
$9,700. They stayed temporarily in another motel before Oglethorpe
University agreed to take them in.
   Oglethorpe President Donald S. Stanton said about 40 of the
stranded performers will stay on the school's Atlanta campus for
about a week and will eat free meals in the dorm's cafeteria.
   Others will stay with families in the Atlanta area through
arrangements made by a local Baptist church, Stanton said.
   Circus tour manager Bob Liberman said negotiations were under way
Thursday for a performance in Kentucky. He said the deal is likely
to be completed by Friday.
   Liberman said he was grateful for Oglethorpe's offer.
   ``They agreed to do it out of the kindness of their hearts,'' he
said.
   Stanton said the wife of the university's registrar called him
Wednesday night after seeing a televised report on the circus' woes.
Stanton said he spoke with university residential officials, who
worked out the details with circus members.
   The dorm where the performers will stay was being painted,
Stanton said, but the work was halted temporarily.
   ``We're putting up `Wet Paint' signs in Russian, so they'll
know,'' Stanton said.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Thursday directed their top diplomatic aides to meet
next week to seek a post-summit agreement on the military face of a
united Germany.
   A meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was set for Tuesday
in Copenhagen, after Bush and Gorbachev reached an impasse on
whether a new Germany would be a member of NATO. A second June
session, in Berlin, was tentatively scheduled for the two aides.
   Bush and Gorbachev exchanged what the Soviet leader called new
approaches, and Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said
optimistically: ``The ideas presented amount to a way to meld the
concerns of the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Later, a Bush administration official sought to play down any
perception that there had been a breakthrough. The official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bush would call West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl within the next day or so ``to reassure him
that we have not changed our position'' on a united Germany.
   Bush is determined to secure NATO membership for the new Germany
once it is created, while Gorbachev is equally intent on keeping the
country out of the Western alliance or at least restricting the size
of the German army.
   ``Both the U.S. side and the Soviet side put forth certain ideas
and suggestions'' on Thursday, Gorbachev said. He gave no details,
but a Soviet official told The Associated Press the Soviets wanted
Germany's future taken up by the 35-nation European Security
Conference.
   ``I hope that we understand each other's concerns better,''
Gorbachev said as he left the White House.
   ``This exchange of views now requires that our foreign ministers
have a more in-depth discussion,'' he told reporters. ``I think it
is not here that the German question will be resolved.'''
   Bush said later that ``certainly'' was the case. But the U.S.
president, who appeared outside the White House shortly after
Gorbachev left, added, ``When he said that differences had been
narrowed somewhat, I'm taking some heart from that and we'll
continue these discussions tomorrow.''
   ``Fundamental positions have not changed,'' he said.
   Bush offered his own public assurances to Gorbachev that ``we can
work together'' to reduce East-West tensions on a broad front.
   The two leaders aired their differences on Germany publicly at a
morning arrival ceremony and then privately in the Oval Office.
   In addition to the Baker-Shevardnadze session in Copenhagen, U.S.
officials said Baker also will meet separately in the Danish capital
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who has
been the point man for the West in trying to work out an
accommodation with Moscow.
   Genscher, for instance, proposed keeping NATO troops out of what
is now East Germany after the merger with West Germany.
   Baker, Shevardnadze and Genscher had all planned to be in
Copenhagen to attend a 35-nation conference on human rights. A
meeting also had previously been scheduled among the four World War
II allies and the two Germanys in Berlin on the subject of Germany's
future.
   Gorbachev told reporters in a White House driveway that Bush
defended his viewpoint on Germany during their talks.
   ``I think dictation is unacceptable,'' the Soviet leader said,
but he did not renew his accusation of the previous day that the
United States was indeed trying to dictate to the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, Germany and unrest in the Baltics dominated the
meeting Baker held with Shevardnadze at the White House while the
two presidents were in the Oval office, U.S. officials said.
   Just a few blocks away, meanwhile, top-level U.S. and Soviet
negotiators held a fifth day of talks on what will be the summit's
crowning achievements _ a declaration of basic accord to cut
long-range nuclear missiles and a pledge to quickly launch
negotiations for even deeper reductions once the treaty is finished.
   But Deputy Soviet Prime Minister Viktor K. Karpov and Under
Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew and their aides evidently
were unable to make significant progress in arrangements for the
withdrawal of tens of thousands of U.S. and Soviet troops and tanks
from Europe.
   This ``is an area where we will probably not be able to reach
specific agreement at this point,'' Fitzwater said.
   Gorbachev has slowed work on this parallel treaty partly out of
concern that a strengthened Germany would be enrolled in the Western
alliance while his own allies in the Warsaw Pact drift away from the
Soviet orbit.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators held three rounds of talks Thursday
at the State Department.
   Baker, appearing on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' made plain
there would be no retreat in the U.S. position.
   ``All of the Western allies, all of the countries of Western
Europe, and, indeed, three countries of the Warsaw Pact, think that
this would promote stability in Europe, that it's important that
that happen,'' Baker said.
   ``So the Soviet Union is, to some extent, alone among the nations
involved in this who have a problem with it. So our job is to see if
we can better explain it,'' Baker said.
   Bush, in a White House arrival ceremony for the Soviet leader,
hailed the impending unification of East Germany with West Germany
as a milestone toward ``enduring cooperation in a Europe whole and
free.''
   But mindful of Gorbachev's reservations about a more powerful
neighbor, the president assured him ``we can work together at this
historic moment'' to reduce remaining East-West tensions.
   ``The trenches of the Cold War are disappearing,'' Gorbachev said
in response.
   In a thinly veiled reference to his concerns about German
unification and U.S. demands that the new country have NATO
membership, the Soviet leader recalled the Allies' victory over
Nazism in World War II and, earlier, the defeat of Germany in World
War I.
   Gorbachev then pointedly expressed a hope that ``these horrible
wars will forever remain a thing of the past.''
   There were indications the two sides may be in a mood to
compromise. U.S. officials are hinting at negotiations in the future
to scale down both the German and Soviet armies in a tradeoff deal
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

   U.S. Rep. Patricia Saiki formally announced
her candidacy Thursday for the U.S. Senate seat once held by the
late Spark Matsunaga.
   The Republican lawmaker said she could bring the overwhelmingly
Democratic state more clout with the White House than could the
Democrat appointed to hold Matsunaga's office until a special
election in November.
   Matsunaga died April 15 of cancer at age 73.
   Saiki's main competition is expected to come from former U.S.
Rep. Daniel Akaka, who was appointed to replace Matsunaga. Akaka,
like Matsunaga a Democrat, has declared his candidacy.
   Saiki had already said she intended to run for the seat but said
she wanted to make her candidacy official in her native Hilo.
   In a speech at Mooheau Park Pavilion, a traditional rallying spot
for Democrats, Saiki pointed to her achievements as a state
legislator and two-term congresswoman from Honolulu.
   Two other Republicans, Molokai Island rancher Maria Hustace and
former state legislator Richard Sutton, also are candidates.
   ``I offer an independent vote for Hawaii and something more, a
respected voice that can and will be heard in the Oval Office,''
Saiki said.
   Saiki said she wanted to debate Akaka, but Akaka has said he
would decline offers to debate.

   Civic leaders are hawking a collection of
mementoes to help pay expenses associated with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota on Sunday, ranging from handkerchiefs
and T-shirts to posters.
   The ``GorbaChief'' handkerchief was modeled after the ``Homer
Hankies'' waved by Minnesota Twins fans during the 1987 World Series.
   Star Tribune publisher Roger Parkinson, who heads the committee
planning the visit, said 20,000 to 30,000 handkerchiefs bearing the
Gorbachev Visit Committee's official logo were printed. They're $3
each, plus tax.
   The poster is a replica of a $25,000 ad welcoming Gorbachev that
will appear in Pravda, the official newspaper of the Communist
Party. It is the first time Americans have advertised in Pravda and
only the second time an ad has appeared in the newspaper, said Bill
Dunlap, chief executive officer of Campbell-Mithun-Esty, the
Minneapolis-based advertising agency that created the ad.
   Fifty-five hundred posters were printed and will go for $10 each,
plus the inevitable tax.
   The T-shirts bear the official logo, which includes an outline of
the state of Minnesota and a hammer and sickle. Five hundred
T-shirts will go on sale Thursday for $14 each, and more are to be
printed if needed.
   For smaller budgets, there's a postcard, bearing the logo and a
postmark commemorating the visit, for $1.
   Gifts for the Gorbachevs were displayed in the governor's
reception room Wednesday, including bottles of Boundary Waters Beer,
named for the region of lakes on the U.S.-Canadian border;
sweatshirts depicting the Minnesota state flower, the showy lady
slipper; and a commemorative limited edition of the Russian version
of the Monopoly game produced by Minnetonka-based Tonka Corp.

<TEXT>
   Rebel troops advanced to within 25 miles
of the capital Thursday, and the Pentagon announced that a U.S. navy
flotilla with more than 2,000 Marines was off Liberia in case
American citizens need to be evacuated.
   President Samuel Doe on Thursday refused to resign despite the
advance of the insurgents, and vowed to be the last person to leave
the city.
   ``Tough times never last. Tough people do,'' Doe told a group of
foreign ambassadors, according to one envoy at the meeting.
   His statements heightened fears of a bloody conflict if the two
armies clash in the West African capital. So far, more than 1,000
people have been killed in the 5-month-old rebellion, most of them
civilians slain by government troops.
   Late Thursday, the State Department warned in a travel advisory
that conditions in the country were deteriorating and ordered all
non-essential U.S. personnel to depart immediately.
   Cmdr. David Thomas, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said
the U.S. flotilla includes a destroyer, an amphibious assault ship,
a tank landing ship and other support vessels carrying ammunition
and combat supplies.
   Aboard the ships were 179 Marine officers and 2,102 enlisted men,
Thomas said.
   He said the U.S. ships are under orders to ``be prepared to
evacuate American citizens in the event that they would no longer be
able to leave the country by commercial means.''
   About 10,000 Americans, mostly businessmen and missionaries, are
in Liberia.
   The 11 U.N. expatriate workers in Liberia evacuated the country
Thursday for security reasons.
   Terry Lewis, coordinator of the U.N. Disaster Relief
Organization, said they were sad to leave. ``We had a lot of work to
do here. People won't starve yet, but there are going to be some
very hungry people.''
   Lewis said they hoped to return, ``possibly in a few weeks when
the security situation improves.''
   Doe spoke with diplomats who protested an attack on the U.N.
compound Wednesday by soldiers carrying out reprisals against
unarmed civilians.
   According to ambassadors at the meeting, Doe promised to send
troops to protect diplomatic missions. But one envoy told The
Associated Press they were trying to find a diplomatic way to refuse
the offer.
   ``The last thing we want is unruly armed Doe soldiers. We would
rather have policemen,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Doe was defiant during the meeting, despite a promise he made to
a rally Friday that he would make any sacrifice, including stepping
down, if it helped end bloodshed.
   ``He said he would not resign but would be the last person to
leave,'' the diplomat said.
   Doe's ministers appeared not to be as resolute. Hotel owners said
many had moved into their establishments, fearing to sleep in their
houses where they could be rebel targets.
   Rumors in Monrovia said Doe forced his ministers to hand in their
passports to prevent them from leaving the country.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor said in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday that he would not be satisfied with
Doe's resignation. The rebels have accused Doe's administration of
corruption, economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Taylor said his fighters would not stop until they had taken
Monrovia and formed their own government. Taylor's fighters captured
the country's main port of Buchanan, 95 miles east of the capital,
five days ago.
   Rebels were reported to be ambushing troops within a few miles of
Robertsfield International Airport, 20 miles from the capital.
   In Monrovia, there were reports that members of Doe's Krahn tribe
and Mandingos, who are accused of supporting Krahns and exploiting
other tribes, were trying to evacuate for fear that rebels would
attack the capital.
   Many of the rebels are members of the Gio and Mano tribes, who
last week were the target of attacks that killed 11 people.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight soldiers
wearing masks forced their way Wednesday into the U.N. compound in
Monrovia, where 1,000 refugees had gathered to demand protection and
safe conduct out of the country.
   Giuliani said the soldiers killed one guard and wounded another,
then abducted about 30 people. The bodies of three abducted men and
a youth were found later dumped outside the capital. Doe denied
responsibility and said he would punish those responsible.
   Doe seized power as a master sergeant in a bloody 1980 coup that
ousted elitist descendants of slaves who discriminated against
native Liberians. Liberia, a country of 2 million, was founded by
freed American slaves in 1847.
   Doe and his officers are members of the Krahn tribe, which makes
up only 2 percent of the population in this nation of 14 small
tribes.
   The rebels are chiefly Gio and Mano tribesmen, although Taylor
had an American-Liberian father and a Bassa mother.
   The rebellion began Dec. 24 with an invasion of 200 rebels from
Ivory Coast. What started as a minor rebellion escalated into a war
because government atrocities have won the rebels thousands of
recruits.

   Flash floods fed by up to seven inches of
rain forced closure of low-lying roads and chased hundreds of people
from their homes Thursday, some of whom fled in boats.
   Creeks that empty into the rain-swollen Mississippi River
overflowed their banks in heavy thunderstorms.
   ``We've had flash flooding all day. It hit pretty suddenly,''
said Warren County Sheriff Paul Barrett. ``A lot of them have lost
everything they had.''
   Barrett said more than 130 houses in the city were flooded and
between 30 and 40 county homes have been flooded.
   No injuries were reported, the sheriff said.
   ``We were lucky,'' said Barrett. ``We packed some people out on

heading to a motel.''
   Up to seven inches of rain fell during the day in some areas.
   By 8:35 p.m., the Vicksburg Police Department reported that most
of the flooding in the city had subsided.
   Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency in Warren County and
called out the Mississippi National Guard to help officials and
residents deal with the flooding.
   Barrett said some residents could probably return to their houses
Friday, while others may have to wait through the weekend.
   Parts of U.S. 61 were closed because of high water for several
hours Thursday but had been reopened by late Thursday. Other county
and city roads also were closed, city officials said.

   He almost missed his American debut.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater waited more than an
hour for his new counterpart, Arkady Afrikanovich Maslennikov, to
appear at the summit press center, then decided to go ahead without
him.
   ``We have received differing reports on my counterpart's
progress,'' Fitzwater told the hundreds of assembled journalists,
who had been waiting with growing impatience for the first joint
U.S.-Soviet briefing on the start of the summit meeting between
Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Maslennikov eventually did appear, explaining his tardiness with
a quip that instantly pitted him against Fitzwater as a
spokesman-cum-humorist.
   ``I was trying to get more information so I could be more
specific than my counterpart, Mr. Fitzwater,'' the new Soviet
presidential spokesman said.
   Maslennikov, 58, replaced the familiar face of Gennady I.
Gerasimov, who remains chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry but no longer speaks for Gorbachev, who appointed his own
press secretary in April after assuming his new, stronger
presidency. There has been speculation that Gerasimov was passed
over for the job because he did not get along with the Western press
corps, which has become increasingly important to Gorbachev.
   A longtime Pravda reporter who speaks heavily accented but quite
fluent English acquired during tours in India, Pakistan and Britain,
Maslennikov paried reporters' questions like an old pro, joking
occasionally but never varying from his boss's familiar positions on
prospects for a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, the disagreement over
the military future of a united Germany and the agreements the
leaders are scheduled to sign on Friday.
   He said he would speak in Russian and use a translator for the
largely English-speaking press corps because ``I just don't want to
use my very ugly English.'' But he quickly found his English was up
to the task and more convenient than wrestling with the earphones
and wireless receiver used for listening to the interpretation.
   He confessed he had spoken to Fitzwater in advance for some
pointers on handling the horde of reporters that far outnumbers the
Moscow press corps. But as he was surrounded after the formal
briefing and peppered with an unceasing string of more questions, he
pleaded, ``Don't squeeze me dry. Leave something for next time.''

   A teen-ager pleaded guilty Thursday to assaulting
a male jogger the night a female jogger was raped, beaten and left
for dead in the Central Park ``wilding'' case. He was sentenced to a
year in jail.
   Michael Briscoe, 18, who wasn't charged in the attack on the
woman, pleaded guilty before state Supreme Court Justice Thomas
Galligan to one count of second-degree assault, the top charge in
his indictment.
   Briscoe could have been sentenced to seven years in prison on the
assault charge.
   He had already pleaded guilty on May 7 to selling a small amount
of PCP, or ``angel dust,'' to an undercover police officer on May 4.
Galligan gave him a year on the drug charge, to run concurrently
with the assault sentence.
   ``It was a deal he could not turn down,'' said Briscoe's lawyer,
Joseph Klempner. He added that nothing in the deal requires Briscoe
to testify against codefendants but he will continue to talk to
prosecutors.
   Briscoe was one of eight youths indicted in the attack on David
Lewis, 31, a banker who was jumped and beaten viciously as he jogged
in the north end of Central Park the night of April 19, 1989.
   A second teen-ager, Jermain Robinson, was sentenced to one year
in jail after he pleaded guilty earlier to one count of first-degree
robbery in the attack on Lewis and another jogger that night, John
Loughlin, a teacher.
   Lewis, reached at his office, refused to comment on Briscoe's
sentence but said, ``I've been told by the DA's office to be
prepared to testify. It's their call.''
   The other six youths are awaiting trial in the attacks on Lewis
and Loughlin and the near-fatal rape and beating of the woman jogger.
   The woman, now 29, was left battered and bleeding in a mud
puddle. She recovered remarkably, doctors say, and has returned to
work at an investment bank.
   The viciousness of the attack shocked the city and garnered
headlines around the nation.
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin June 13 for the three of the
defendants.

   Seven members of a Hong Kong theater troupe who'd
been denied visas to come to New York for a performance
commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre were granted permission
to enter the country Thursday.
   The seven had been stranded in England, where they recently
completed five performances, and were to arrive in New York on
Thursday night, said Eleanor Yung, director of the Asian American
Arts Centre.
   The center is sponsoring the New York performance of ``Deep
Structure of Chinese Culture,'' scheduled for Saturday at the
Borough of Manhattan Community College.
   A pro-democracy movement in the People's Republic of China was
crushed last June 4 when government troops killed hundreds of
demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   The visas were denied by the U.S. Embassy in London last week due
to concern that the performers with the Zuni Icosohedron theater
troupe would not return to Hong Kong once they were in the United
States, Ms. Yung said.
   She said the visas were issued after the Hong Kong Consulate
General assured U.S. officials the performers would not try to
immigrate illegally. She said numerous U.S. politicians and other
concerned citizens had lobbied on the performers' behalf.
   The visas were granted Thursday morning in London, she said, and
the performers boarded a flight to New York later in the day.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Ms. Yung said.
   The theater company's name refers to an American Indian tribe and
a 25-sided geometric shape. Four members of the troupe were issued
visas earlier, and will take part in the performance with the seven
performers flying in Thursday.

   The Soviet Union has protested illegal Japanese
fishing in its waters and is seeking millions of dollars in
compensation for losses, an official said Thursday.
   The Foreign Ministry delivered a protest note to the Japanese
Embassy in Moscow complaining of systematic violations of fishing
treaties to the point that ``the agreements themselves are
threatened,'' spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said.
   Perfiliev told reporters that illegal fishing exhausts stock
reserves, costing the Soviet Union millions of dollars. He said the
illegal fishing must be stopped and the damages paid.
   In Tokyo, Soviet diplomatic sources said a protest was addressed
to North Korea as well concerning the illegal salmon fishing in
Soviet-claimed waters of the north Pacific.
   It referred to the seizure of six Japanese fishing boats May 9-13
off Soviet-held Sakhalin island, said the diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The boats and their crews were released soon
after the seizures.
   Perfiliev said the ``actions of the Japanese side'' were to blame
for the incidents. ``It's obvious that if not for such crude
violations, the Soviet side would not have seen the necessity of
acting to correct the situation.''
   The protest lodged with Japan did not, however, mention the
highly publicized seizures May 19-22 of 10 North Korean vessels,
manned mostly by Japanese fishermen, that were also found operating
illegally in Soviet waters.
   Moscow has filed a separate complaint with the North Korean
Embassy over those seizures, the diplomatic sources said.
   ``I believe this is the most large-scale case to date,'' one
source said. ``They were caught with 170,000 salmon on board. That's
quite a lot.''
   Although 70 percent to 80 percent of the crew members and much of
the equipment aboard the vessels were Japanese, the sources said,
the Soviet Union believes legal responsibility remains with North
Korea because the ships flew the North Korean flag and had North
Korean captains.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry on Thursday announced that 169
Japanese fishermen were being held by the Soviets on Shikotan, a
small island in the Kurile chain just off the northern Japanese
island of Hokkaido.
   The Soviet sources could not confirm the number of Japanese
fishermen being detained.
   The Japanese fishermen are believed to have thought they would be
given more lenient treatment if caught while flying the North Korean
flag. North Korea is a Soviet ally.
   The North Korean-flagged ships were seized outside the 200-mile
Soviet zone, the Foreign Ministry said. But under international
rules, migratory fish such as salmon belong to the country where
they were spawned.
   One of the Soviet sources denied speculation that the seizures
indicate a worsening of relations between Moscow and North Korea.
   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations.

   Canada's 10 premiers will meet this weekend to make
a final attempt to rescue the controversial Meech Lake accord, Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said Thursday.
   Mulroney in an announcement said the meeting will be held Sunday
during a working dinner in the capital. He said the meeting could
continue Monday if there are signs of progress over the
constitutional accord, which by law must be ratified by June 23 by
all 10 provinces.
   ``What is in dispute is modest _ extremely modest _ when compared
to what is at stake,'' said Mulroney, who is in favor of the accord.
``What is at stake is Canada.''
   The accord, opposed by New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba,
would recognize Quebec as a ``distinct society'' within Canada.
About one-fourth of Canada's 25 million residents live in Quebec, a
French-speaking province.

   Barbara Bush welcomed Raisa Gorbachev to the
White House Thursday with tea and warm words _ and an instant fan in
Millie, the Bush family dog.
   They all went for a tour of the mansion while the two women's
husbands talked business in the Oval Office.
   ``We had a great meeting renewing an old friendship,'' Mrs. Bush
said afterward through spokeswoman Anna Perez.
   ``She said that Mrs. Gorbachev and Millie bonded,'' Ms. Perez
added with a laugh. The English springer spaniel is a favorite of
many White House visitors, and is quick to warm to strangers.
``Millie sat on Mrs. Gorbachev's foot and she followed her ... all
over the house.''
   By the end of the day, when the Gorbachevs attended a White House
state dinner in their honor, the two wives were what President Bush
wanted to talk about.
   Bush began his formal toast by telling his Soviet counterpart:
``Tomorrow Mr. President, comes the day that so many have been
waiting for, the day when expectations will be at fever pitch.
That's right, tomorrow _ Barbara and Raisa go to Wellesley.''
   The line got an appreciative laugh from guests well familiar with
the controversy over Mrs. Bush's appearance at Wellesley as a
commencement speaker. Her selection prompted objection from some
students that she was not an appropriate role model because her
success is due to her husband's achievements.
   Mrs. Gorbachev has accepted the first lady's invitation to
accompany her to the comencement and make remarks as well.
   There was an air of cordiality between the U.S. and Soviet
presidents' wives from the moment the Gorbachevs arrived for the
start of the four-day summit.
   The last time Mrs. Gorbachev visited Washington, in December
1987, she ruffled Nancy Reagan's feathers by observing that the
White House was more a museum than ``a regular house.''
   Thursday, after a ceremonial welcome on the South Lawn and a
diplomatic receiving line inside, Mrs. Bush took Mrs. Gorbachev
upstairs to the second-floor family quarters for tea and to show her
the Lincoln Bedroom and other parts of the mansion.
   Mrs. Bush described her guest as ``very knowledgeable and very
warm,'' as well as ``very beautiful,'' according to Ms. Perez.
   Outside, Mrs. Bush put a gentle hand on Mrs. Gorbachev's back and
guided her down a line of dignitaries to their places as their
husbands took center stage.
   Mrs. Bush wore a Bill Blass suit, with a lime-green jacket
trimmed in white over a white skirt, and her trademark triple strand
of fake pearls. Mrs. Gorbachev wore a scarlet double-breasted jacket
over a black skirt.
   Even in her black high heels, Mrs. Gorbachev was a couple of
inches shorter than Mrs. Bush, who had on white pumps.
   Mrs. Bush led the applause when her husband said Mrs. Gorbachev's
return to the White House ``brings joy to all of our hearts.''
   The two women had tea with two of Mrs. Bush's daughters-in-law,
Margaret Bush of Alexandria, Va., and Sharon Bush of Denver, as well
as the wives of Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, Assistant Secretary of State Ray Seitz, Jack Matlock,
the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh,
the new Soviet ambassador to Washington.
   Later, Mrs. Gorbachev and her husband lunched at the Soviet
Embassy with American film stars, intellectuals and other luminaries.
   In the afternoon, Mrs. Gorbachev cut a golden ribbon at the
Library of Congress to open an exhibit of Russian religious books
and manuscripts that she said convey ``the national spirit of
Russia.''
   Several hundred guests packed a newly renovated gallery at the
library's ornate Jefferson Building to hear Mrs. Gorbachev, Marilyn
Quayle and other dignitaries at the opening of the exhibit of
illuminated manuscripts and other works on loan from the Soviet
Union.
   It is called ``Living Traditions of Russian Faith: Books and
Manuscripts of the Old Believers'' and several prominent Russian
Orthodox churchmen were on hand to greet the wife of the Soviet
president.
   Mrs. Gorbachev expressed hope that Americans would find ``the
national spirit of Russia'' in viewing the works of the Old
Believers, a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church that until recent
years faced difficult times in its communist homeland.

   A nurse accused of slashing seven patients'
intravenous feeding tubes because he was angry at the hospital where
he worked was arrested Thursday on a felony charge.
   No one was seriously injured, although the last incident
discovered Monday, involving an 83-year-old woman whose tube had
also been slashed Saturday, was potentially life-threatening,
authorities said.
   Kevin Koss, 38, of Broward County was charged with tampering with
products with intent to do great bodily harm or death, and was being
held late Thursday in the Broward County Jail awaiting a bond
hearing.
   If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison.
   Kloss, a licensed practical nurse, was working on the fourth
floor of University Community Hospital in this Fort Lauderdale
suburb, where eight slashing incidents occurred over the Memorial
Day weekend, the county sheriff's office said.
   Kloss, who police say confessed under questioning, had worked the
overnight shift, when nearly all the incidents occurred, said
sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.
   ``His motive was that he was angry at the hospital for some
disciplinary action ... and he wanted to get back at the hospital,''
said Sheriff Nick Navarro.
   Detectives were still investigating, and it wasn't clear what
prompted the disciplinary action, Leljedal said.
   ``We know that he had some disciplinary problems with the
hospital and as a result of that, the hospital had taken away his
key to the narcotics cabinet and he took that as a personal
affront,'' Leljedal said.
   Kloss had worked at the hospital for more than two years, the
sheriff's office said.

federation of strong states that can overrule Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's central government on most matters.
   Outlining his plans at a news conference Wednesday, the radical
populist reformer said he would seek sovereignty for Russia, the
largest Soviet republic, within his first 100 days in office.
   He also demanded that Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov resign
for what he called a failure to deal decisively with the country's
economic turmoil, and said he would open treaty talks immediately
with the secessionist Baltic republics.
   ``We must turn this pyramid on its head,'' Yeltsin said.

   Frightened residents of this jungle town
spent their second night in the streets after earthquake-prone
Peru's deadliest temblor in two decades killed at least 115 people
and injured hundreds more.
   Hundreds of people crowded into Rioja's central plaza, afraid to
enter their damaged homes. Many lay inside tents or beneath
umbrellas while others crowded around smoky cooking fires in the
jungle twilight.
   More than 800 people were injured and at least 40 missing after
the earthquake, which registered 6.2 on the Richter scale, rocked
northern Peru late Tuesday night, civil defense authorities said.
   The damage was centered around Moyobamba, a farming center of

   Senators padded their incomes by $2.7 million
last year by speaking to special-interest groups, but the practice
seems to be losing some of its appeal.
   The total honoraria income for senators in 1989, reported
Wednesday in annual financial disclosures, was slightly below the
levels for the two previous years. And the lobbying group Common
Cause said that for this year, more than one-third of the Senate _
34 members, up from 19 in 1988 _ have sworn off keeping speaking
fees for their personal use.
   One member on the Common Cause list, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, has
relapsed. After declining in the past to keep honoraria, he
retained $11,284 last year, saying he was strapped for funds
because of the cost of maintaining three houses. Boschwitz,
president of a lumber company, has holdings that could be worth
more than $3.4 million. Common Cause said he has promised to resume
his old policy this year.
   As usual, the top talker was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., who raked in $108,900. Senators are not allowed to keep
more than 40 percent of their salaries in honoraria, so Dole gave
all but $35,750 to charity.

   Vincent ``The Chin'' Gigante is no dapper don:
he prefers a bathrobe and pajamas to a silk shirt and designer
suits and wears slippers instead of Guccis as he rambles through
the streets of Greenwich Village.
   But authorities say that Gigante's befuddled ways are a dodge
and that the reputed boss of the Genovese crime family is every bit
as ruthless as the better-known, better-dressed John Gotti. Gigante
even put a contract out on Gotti in 1987, authorities in New Jersey
allege.
   Gigante, who until now had been untouched by a government
crackdown on the Mafia, was among 15 people from four mob families
charged Wednesday with monopolizing the installation of windows in
the city's housing projects since 1978.
   The business brought mob companies more than $191 million,

   You've seen ``Dick Tracy: The Hype.'' Now
it's time for ``Dick Tracy: The Movie.''
   The Disney Co. screened the Warren Beatty-Madonna film for
reviewers Wednesday, climaxing months of buildup aimed at
acquainting potential patrons with the half-forgotten comic strip
and Beatty's efforts to convert it into a megahit.
   Scheduled for wide release on June 15, ``Dick Tracy'' bears
Disney's hopes for another smash like ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
The production cost was high _ estimates range from $23 million to
$30 million _ for a film with little apparent built-in appeal for
the younger crowd that is the backbone of today's film audience.
   The competition for summer tickets is fierce: ``Total Recall,''
``Days of Thunder'' and rehashes of ``Die Hard,'' ``Robocop,'' ``48
Hrs'' and ``Back To The Future.'' Against such predictable fare
``Dick Tracy'' is distinguished by its originality.

   In Swedish sports history, Harry
Persson was a tragic figure.
   A talented heavyweight, he went to the United States in 1926 to
try to take the world boxing title from Jack Dempsey. He was beaten
by his own naivete and honesty.
   Now two Swedes are putting Persson's story to music for a
full-length opera, commissioned by the Royal Opera House.
   ``It is a tear-jerker, full of hard punches against the tear
glands,'' said novelist Torbjorn Savfe, author of the libretto. The
score is being composed by Lars-Ake Franke-Blom, for a 1992
premiere.
   Savfe said the opera, understood to be the first written about a
boxer, is full of ring action. Even the Statue of Liberty wears a
boxing glove in one scene.
   The music is modern, interwoven with hits from the 1920s.
   Persson was a stone worker with a rock-hard right who beat every
European he met in the ring. He was an idol whose popularity in the
economically depressed Sweden of the '20s matched that of another
sports hero of the early '80s, tennis champion Bjorn Borg.
   ``The Americans longed for a ... European who could match Jack
Dempsey,'' Savfe said. Dempsey was heavyweight champion 1919-1926.
   Persson crossed the Atlantic with hopes of punching his way to
wealth and fame. His Swedish compatriot, the late actress Greta
Garbo, arrived a year ahead of him.
   But reality dealt Persson a knockout blow. He was confronted by
a boxing world controlled by cheats and intriguers. Anyone who
refused to play by their rules was crushed.
   ``Persson was the honest Swede filled with romantic ideas of the
American dream of success. He believed he could beat his way to the
gold through good craftsmanship,'' Savfe said. ``He was completely
outwitted.''
   Persson began well, defeating Johnny Risco, Carl Carter and Jack
Adams.
   But Persson insisted on doing things his way. He refused to fire
his Swedish manager and sign on with American promoters. Suddenly,
he started losing.
   In a match against Bud Gorman, Persson was disqualified for
hitting below the belt after Gorman had lifted his shorts high over
his abdomen.
   ``He lost on points against Pat McCarthy, although he won 10
rounds. ... He was the victim of con tricks,'' Safve said.
   Persson never got a chance to meet Dempsey. He returned to
Sweden in 1927, disillusioned, his boxing career virtually over.
His wife took his money and their son and deserted him, Savfe said.
   The staging of the opera includes several of Persson's
successful matches and his disqualification in the Gorman fight. In
a final scene, four years after he returns to Sweden a fallen hero,
Persson fights Norwegian Otto von Porat.
   ``He goes down and just sits on the mat in the ring after the
first blow in the first round, and he shakes his head. The tragedy
is completed,'' Savfe said.
   Persson died in 1979, at age 81. Savfe said no one visited him
in a sanatorium outside Stockholm during the last seven years of
his life.
   Sweden got a world heavyweight champion in 1959, when Ingemar
Johansson beat Floyd Patterson. Patterson retook the title a year
later. Johansson is now 57 and occasionally appears as a sports
commentator on television.

   ``I never look at anybody,'' says the 23-year-old British soul
singer, whose debut album, ``Affection,'' quickly went gold.
   ``I just look straight ahead or at the floor and hope I go the
right way. When you walk down the street there's going to someone
who's going to start whispering and pointing. That's part of what I
am now.''
   A few years ago, she and songwriting partners Ian Devaney and
Andy Morris were sitting in a Manchester pub, sharing stories of
boring jobs and dead-end bands, wondering if they should take a
crack at forming a group.
   Now, Stansfield sits at a small table in the lounge of a
Manhattan hotel, still tired from playing the night before in
Philadelphia, the first time she had visited the city of Teddy
Pendergrass, the O'Jays and other soul performers of the '70s she
heard as a kid.
   ``When you're really young you think of American musicians of
being different, on the other side of the world, completely
different people,'' said Stansfield, wearily pouring herself tea.
``It's like they're not real in a way. You build them up in your
own mind.
   ``I remember my sister used to be into the Beach Boys. She
always used to go baby-sitting on a Saturday night and she always
used to put the Beach Boys on. You did have the picture of going on
the beach, surfing. It always seemed like a dream world, far from
what I am.''
   Over an hour long, ``Affection'' sounds as if it were a a
minihistory of soul music in Stansfield's lifetime, from the
Supremes to Aretha Franklin to the Philadelphia groups. Stansfield,
born in Roachdale, England, is something of a minihistorian
herself, starting her musical education at age 4 with Motown
records.
   ``A lot of English bands and English people were influenced by
soul music,'' said Stansfield, referring to Soul II Soul, Simply
Red, Sade and other performers of ``Brit-soul.''
   ``Obviously, they imitated that sound and that kind of singing.
I've got an accent like this because of my parents. I sing like
this because of those records.''
   By the time she was 10, Stansfield had decided she wanted to
sing and had already met her future musical partners; she attended
the same school as Devaney while Morris was a friend from another
school.
   Together, these three blue-eyed soul artists _ Blue Zone, they
call themselves _ do their best to copy sounds they were too young
to hear the first time around. The single ``All Around the World''
is a perfect example, a dance song complete with opening rap, sharp
string breaks, Philadelphia style and Stansfield's gospel turns on
the chorus.
   ``Ian came up with the riff, melody and chorus, and he said,
`Can you do something to this, write some lyrics, do some verses
and bridge?''' Stansfield explained. ``It's quite simple. A lot of
the songs on the album were like that. I think that's where the
magic lies, in the spontaneity.''
   Writing is a little like walking the streets for Stansfield, a
matter of closing her eyes and hoping she heads in the right
direction. At that same sob session in Manchester, Morris and
Devaney argued with her about writing songs. She had never tried
and didn't want to.
   Her friends persisted, pointing out her gift for improvising and
insisting that writing required the same skills.
   ``Whatever comes out of my fingers, comes out, basically,''
Stansfield said.
   ``It's really strange sometimes. Your mind thinks so quickly.
It's got a word ready before you've written the last one. Five
minutes later, you've got two verses and a chorus. You look at it
and it makes complete sense. You think, `Where did that come from?'
''
   If meeting people on the street is no longer possible,
Stansfield can at least check out the fans while on stage. A
surprising mix, she says, black and white, old and young. She can
also shake hands with some famous strangers, the ones who taught
her to sing, the kind of people who've spent years listening to
whispers on the street.
   ``It's so weird when you meet all these people. It's like you've
idolized these people all this time,'' Stansfield said. ``I met
Dionne Warwick and she was so complimentary, just a normal woman,
just like me. I just thought, `Yeah, right on!'''

<HEAD>Changing Social Values Challenge Japan's Sex Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sex business has been a fast track to success
for Kimiko Matsuzaka, queen of porno videos, but Japanese social
values are changing and someday that road may close.
   Ms. Matsuzaka earns more than five times the average for a
working woman of her age, which is 21, and now is moving into more
conventional entertainment. She recently completed a series of
appearances, fully dressed, in a prime-time television drama and is
a regular on a television talk show.
   ``I see myself as a success story,'' she said in an interview at
the offices of Diamond Visual, Inc., one of Japan's most prolific
makers of adult videos. ``I'm happy doing what I'm doing.''
   Other porno stars have moved smoothly into mainstream
entertainment before Ms. Matsuzaka, who made 15 videos last year,
and many more may want to follow.
   Opposition is growing to Japan's anything-goes ``pink world,''
which ranges from geisha liaisons with politicians to neon-lit
strip joints and bathhouses that sell sex.
   ``It is abnormal for a society to nurture the sex business the
way Japan's does,'' said Mizuho Matsuda, director of HELP, a
shelter for women. ``Major TV networks and magazines praise it
without the awareness that this just isn't right.''
   Critics of sex on television won a major victory in April with
the cancellation of a talk-variety program that had pushed the
limits of discretion for 25 years. It mixed trendy themes with
nudity, scenes from porno videos and reviews of sex shops.
   ``A few years ago, programming was such that the networks were
even criticized in Parliament,'' said an official of the National
Association of Commercial Broadcasters, to which all five major
private networks belong.
   No legislation was enacted and each network made changes
voluntarily, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Matsuda of HELP said social values are changing, but she
believes the main reason for less sex on television is that it has
become less profitable.
   ``Sex stopped boosting TV ratings because of the increasing
abundance of porno videos, books and other materials,'' she said.
``People who want to watch that kind of thing no longer look for it
on television.''
   There are other signs of changing values.
   A scandal arising from allegations that Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno had kept a paid mistress helped drive him from office last
summer, and a Tokyo district packed with high-profile sex
businesses is in decline.
   The notorious Kabukicho was noted for bars, glitzy massage
parlors and streets of ``love hotels'' with special rates for stays
of an hour or so.
   Norio Iwabuchi, chairman of an association of sex business
owners in the district, said Kabukicho peaked about five years ago
with about 200 businesses. Tougher rules were enforced in 1985 and
the number has declined by two-thirds, he said.
   Iwabuchi said he believed authorities imposed stricter zoning
and restrictions on operating hours because the industry became too
gaudy.
   ``The police look at prostitution this way: Don't get rid of it
all; leave some and close your eyes so long as it stays in its
place and there isn't any trouble,'' he said. ``We stood out too
much.
   ``It used to be possible for a woman to start in a peep show and
go on to become a star, but those days are gone,'' Iwabuchi said,
as a seminude Filipina danced before oneway mirrors at one of the
Kabukicho peep shows he owns.
   He attributed much of the change to Japan's growing wealth and
greater opportunity for women to earn good pay in other work.
   ``Money used to justify just about anything, but Japan now can
afford to look down on people who make it the way we do,'' he said.
   Not many years ago, travel agencies helped organize sex tours to
Asian countries, where more than 1 million Japanese men sought the
services of prostitutes in the early 1980s.
   Criticism from Southeast Asian countries helped cool that fad,
but at about the same time, tens of thousands of Asian women began
arriving in Japan each year.
   Since 1986, Ms. Matsuda's center has helped nearly 1,000 women
escape exploitation in the sex business, most of them from Thailand
or the Philippines.
   The women are called ``Japa-yuki,'' meaning those who go to
Japan. Ironically, the word comes from ``Kara-yuki,'' for Japanese
women who went abroad as maids or prostitutes early in the century.
   Many Kara-yuki were sold by their families as a way to escape
poverty. Sending a daughter into prostitution was never honorable,
but in those days Japanese authorities licensed brothels and they
were an accepted aspect of society.
   Japan's long history of sexual freedom for men lives on in a
multibillion-dollar sex industry.
   Telephone booths near railroad stations are plastered with
stickers advertising clubs where prostitutes can be contacted.
Young businessmen paging through sexually explicit comic books are
a common sight.
   Pornographic magazines are on the racks in neighborhood
convenience stores and campaigners against sex-for-sale find it a
tough target.
   ``Prostitution wasn't outlawed until 1958, and then only because
Japan felt pressure from the United States, so the social awareness
of the sex industry as bad is still shallow,'' Ms. Matsuda said.
   Japan has 1,463 ``soaplands,'' or bathhouses that sell sex,
police say. According to statistics from 1988, the most recent
available, 3,337 people were arrested for prostitution and related
offenses.
   Police officials acknowledge privately that the statistics
represent only a small fraction of the activity.
   ``This is a man's paradise,'' said Nobuko Oba, a member of the
Tokyo city council. ``Anything you might want, you can find it
here.''
   She added, however, that Uno's ``geisha scandal'' showed social
values were changing.
   Ms. Oba granted that the reports of the prime minister having
paid a former geisha to be his mistress shocked the political world
because the woman and media broke the code of silence, not because
of the moral implications of Uno's conduct.
   ``But the fact that it created a controversy is enough for me,''
she said. ``I think the sex scandal proved that at least the
public's way of looking at women and the sex industry is changing.''
   Ms. Oba has created a stir by demanding the Tokyo city
government stop supporting bus tours to ``oiran'' shows in
Yoshiwara, the former brothel district.
   Oiran were high-class prostitutes in the samurai days. The tours
are promoted as a cultural outing to see an elaborately costumed
woman perform an oiran's dance and play traditional instruments.
   Tokyo is the bus company's major shareholder. The oiran tours
continue.

<TEXT>
   The narrow, hot, smoky corridors of a
resettlement office are crammed with Soviet Jews: young and
middle-aged couples, elderly women, World War II veterans with rows
of medals on their chests.
   Hysterical arguments flare up in the long lines. Besieged
officials look exhausted. A woman tries to push ahead of others to
a lawyer who is supposed to help immigrants deal with landlords.
   Several people shout angrily. Finally, someone cries: ``Please,
please, stop it! Are we all animals?''
   Confusion is everywhere as Israel struggles to absorb a huge
influx of Soviet Jews that caught the government by surprise,
threatening to overwhelm social services and balloon the national
debt and unemployment.
   The surge of arrivals also complicates the Middle East
situation. Artab nations see the immigration as a threat to
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Officials and private citizens in Israel welcome the newcomers,
whatever the problems they pose, as a fulfillment of the age-old
dream of ``ingathering'' Jewish exiles.
   Israelis hope the tide will result in the country having enough
Jews to survive economically and militarily, to keep abreast of an
Arab population with a much higher birth rate.
   The Soviet immigants also may break the deadlock in the struggle
for political control between the center-left Labor Party of Shimon
Peres and the right-wing Likud bloc led by Yitzhak Shamir, the
caretaker prime minister.
   They will tip the ethnic balance between the Jews of European
origin and those from Middle East countries, how virtually equal in
number, and influence the relative weight given to religious and
secular issues.
   Already, their presence has changed the face of Israeli society.
   Television news carries subtitles in the Cyrillic alphabet.
Banks advertise savings plans in Russian.
   Department store chains hire Russian-speaking personnel and
offer the newcomers special installment plans. Liquor stores stock
Israeli-made vodka called by such familiar names as Stolichnaya and
Zubrowka, a Polish brand popular in the Soviet Union.
   Satellite dishes on immigrants' houses are tuned to Moscow
television. Newspaper stands offer Russian-language weeklies.
British tycoon Robert Maxwell and the Hebrew newspaper Maariv plan
to publish a daily in Russian.
   State television has devoted hours of programming to the new
Israelis, including a three-hour broadcast with live hookups to
Moscow and a to plane carrying immigrants from from Budapest,
Hungary.
   Pushed by growing uncertainty and anti-Semitism in the Soviet
Union and new restrictions on U.S. immigration, Soviet arrivals
rose from a trickle to a record 35,000 so far in 1990.
   Forecasts say 500,000 to 1 million Soviet Jews could come
eventually. That would be the largest influx since 1948-1951, when
the new nation took in 685,000 immigrants from 42 countries,
doubling its population.
   Months passed before Israeli officials fully comprehended the
sheer volume, which has reached 1,000 on some days.
   The official forecast of 40,000 immigrants in 1990 has been
raised to at least 100,000 and possibly 150,000.
   ``Israel is now in the midst of an emergency,'' said Yitzhak
Peretz, the absorption minister. ``The wave of immigration grows
every day. We must act urgently.''
   Jews abroad have undertaken a major fund-raising effort,
including a pledge of $420 million by U.S. Jews, but it is far from
enough.
   In early May, the government added $1.25 billion to the $900
million budgeted for settling immigrants. That meant budget cuts
and more borrowing abroad.
   The system can't keep up.
   In Holon, a Tel Aviv suburb, Nissim Spiegelmacher gets up at 4
a.m. An hour later, he joins a line forming outside the Absorption
Ministry office, which opens at 7 a.m.. Other immigrants, who
arrive later, are turned away.
   ``An official has to deal with 35 families a day,'' said
Spiegelmacher, 49, a bearded engineer from Odessa. ``The rooms are
crowded. ... The organization is terrible.''
   His wife, Nora, a 47-year-old chemist, complained that
government offices were open only in the morning, while they were
in Hebrew class. One of them has to miss class in order to get the
paperwork done, she said.
   Alexei Streimushov, a theater director from Kiev in his late
20s, mused that long lines were familiar to Soviet immigrants.
   ``In those lines, people bark at each other; they start to hate
each other, just like in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Housing and employment are the main problems. The government
wants to start building 70,000 apartments this year, including
45,000 public housing units, but officials say the first units
would take 16 months to complete.
   The government system of subsidizing rental apartments has
pushed prices up and led to a projected shortage of 29,000 units in
the medium-price range by the end of this year.
   Nathan Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet prison camps
for human rights activism and immigrated in 1986, said his warnings
about an immigration boom had been ignored and he fears the housing
crisis is not taken seriously.
   ``We have lines of people seeking apartments and it's already
clear that we would not have a single apartment in a few months,''
he said. ``For a year, we speak about construction, and we are not
building.''
   Israel's economy still staggers from loss of tourism and extra
military costs resulting from the 2{-year-old Palestinian uprising.
Unemployment has averaged 9.3 percent so far this year.
   Finding jobs for the Soviet Jews is especially difficult because
one in four is a highly educated professional. They face tough
competition in a labor market that already has 24 percent
professionals, compared to 16 percent in the United States.
   David Mena, head of the state-run Employment Service, said most
immigrants would start hunting jobs late this summer, when their
Hebrew language courses are completed.
   ``When we have six people competing for every job and no new
jobs being created, these immigrants would not find jobs in their
profession,'' he said.
   Immigration has inflamed ethnic tensions among Jews. A debate on
resettlement costs has pitted many Ashkenazis of European descent,
including Soviet Jews, against Sephardis of Middle Eastern origin.
   There are fears that financial resources are being diverted from
the Negev and other predominantly Sephardi areas, where factories
have been closing and laying off workers.
   Some callers to radio shows and letters to newspapers have
suggested the immigrants be put in tent camps like the Sephardis
were in the 1950s.
   Whether more of the newcomers will choose Likud or Labor is not
known, but most are secular and may upset the ultra-Orthodox
political faction's ability to be a kingmaker in coalition
governments.
   The Interior Ministry is controlled by the Shas party, which
represents ultra-Orthodox Sephardi Jews. It demanded proof that the
immigrants were Jewish.
   This angered the Soviet Jews. Officials said many had mixed
marriages and were even non-Jews by Orthodox definition.
   The influx has stirred national pride. Israelis have volunteered
to help, adopting families and taking gifts of furniture and
kitchen utensils to immigrant homes. At least 50 volunteer groups
have been formed.
   ``In many places, we have more volunteers ready to help the
immigrants than we have immigrants,'' said Yuri Stern, an adviser
to Parliament's committee on absorption.
   Uri Gordon, head of the Jewish Agency's immigration department,
said Israel needs 6 million Jews to be secure enough to make peace
with the Arabs.
   ``Negotiations with our neighbors will then be easier,'' he
said. ``Every Jew who comes from Russia makes the prospects for
peace stronger.''
   Arabs, especially the Palestine Liberation Organization, have
expressed fear that immigrants will flood the occupied territories
displacing Palestinians.
   Israeli officials said only about 200 Soviet Jews had settled in
the occupied lands.

   The Horshaks are afraid of leaving, of
what the future in Israel will bring, but uncertainty and
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union are more frightening still.
   They have joined hundreds of thousands of other Soviet Jews in
applying to leave for Israel. A record 35,000 have gone so far in
1990 and Israeli officials expect up to 150,000 Soviet Jews to
arrive by year's end.
   ``We want to leave because the situation, in general, is very
unstable,'' said Svetlana Horshak, a plump, 45-year-old chemist.
``The possibility of some nationalistic outbursts in the country is
also very unpleasant.''
   Russian nationalist movements have had little impact in this
Black Sea port city of 1.1 million, once a thriving Jewish center,
but Odessa is in the Ukraine, which has a long history of
anti-Semitism.
   Mrs. Horshak said: ``I almost don't feel it here, especially
among my friends. But even the talk about possible pogroms
elsewhere is quite unpleasant, and I think there is a 50 percent
possibility it may happen here. ``What is important is that I
cannot say what I can expect from people with whom I have normal,
good relations, under extreme conditions.''
   For her husband, Mikhail, a 43-year-old engineer, fears and
uncertainty about the future are embodied in Marina, their
13-year-old daughter.
   ``She is the reason I want to leave,'' Horshak said.
   He sat at a table bearing thin tablets of unleavened matzo bread
made for Passover, which commemorates the flight of Jews from
ancient Egypt.
   The solitary reminder of the holiday illustrated the frail links
many families in the Soviet Union have with Jewish tradition.
   It took the Horshaks nearly two decades to decide to leave.
   Mrs. Horshak wanted to emigrate in the early 1970s, when some of
her relatives and friends left for Israel and the United States. At
the time, she thought of going to America.
   Mikhail felt he could not abandon his native country and the
town of his birth, and there was no pressing need to impove their
living standard.
   The family has spent four generations in a comparatively
spacious apartment first occupied by Mrs. Horshak's
great-grandmother, who moved to Odessa in the 1920s.
   The Horshaks earn 500 rubles a month, a medium income that kept
them here while others sought a better living abroad.
   Svetlana does environmental research for the city sanitation
department and Mikhail, a maritime engineer, is an expert on
industrial waste disposal.
   After deciding to leave, they asked relatives in Israel to send
them an invitation, which is needed to start emigration procedures.
   The document arrived in April, and now the Horshaks are waiting
to apply for an exit visa. They are No. 180 on the list.
   Even after many radio broadcasts, letters and conversations with
tourists, Israel remains a mystery to the Horshaks.
   They pepper a visitor from Israel with questions: What's the
climate like? Should they take winter clothes, Mikhail's tools? Is
Hebrew a difficult language? Is this furniture worth packing? Would
Mikhail be doing army reserve duty?
   Most of all, they fear having to live in the occupied
territoris, where 70,000 Israeli settlers are surrounded by 1.7
million Palestinians.
   ``Is that true that we are going to be sent to the territories,
to become a buffer between Israelis and Palestinians?'' Mikhail
asked the visitor.
   Israel says there is no policy of settling Jews in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and that only 200 Soviet immigrants live there.
   For Marina, submerged in reading, aerobics and pop music, the
prospect of leaving seems like an adventure.
   Her parents are more realistic. Mikhail, a self-styled mechanic
who tinkers with the family car, said he would work in a garage if
necessary.
   ``We don't have rose-colored glasses,'' he said. ``It is
absolutely clear that, during the first years, everything will be
alien and very hard.''

   Vladimir Kislik, a nuclear physicist who worked
in a Soviet atomic weapons program, has had to take a job analyzing
coal ashes.
   Kislik, who arrived a year ago, is lucky to have work. Nearly
one of every four Soviet Jewish immigrants is a highly educated
professional, and Israel is having trouble absorbing such an influx
of brain power.
   ``Israel cannot provide employment for the thousands of
scientists who will immigrate in the next two years,'' Absorption
Minister Yitzhak Peretz said recently.
   Amos Rubin, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's economics adviser,
said of the highly qualified professionals: ``If we absorb even one
in 10 successfully, we know we are on the right track.''
   This year's immigration figures are staggering, and the volume
caught Israeli officials by surprise.
   The Jewish Agency, which assists immigrants, says each 100,000
immigrants from the Soviet Union includes nearly 23,000
professionals _ about 11,000 engineers, 2,500 doctors and dentists,
2,000 scientists and roughly 7,000 others, such as computer
specialists and nurses.
   Up to 150,000 Soviet Jews are expected to arrive this year.
   No figures are available on how the 10,000 professionals who
arrived in the past six months have fared, but employment
opportunities are limited.
   Universities and government laboratories have places for only a
small number engineers and researchers. Few high-tech jobs are
being created in private industry because of a recession brought
on, in part, by the 2{-year-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   There is fierce competition from Israel's highly skilled labor
force, of which professionals make up 24 percent, compared to 16
percent in the United States.
   Israeli officials say unemployment for university graduates
exceeds the nationwide average rate of 9 percent. Thousands of
engineers and scientists have sought work abroad, mainly in the
United States.
   Haim Harari, a physicist who heads the respected Weizmann
Institute in Rehovot, said earlier this year the Soviet immigrants
should not receive preferential treatment.
   ``I can't accept a situation where we create jobs only open to
Russian immigrants and Israelis are in the United States waiting to
come back, but can't find jobs,'' he said. ``It's sheer idiocy to
export our people to the United States and import Russians.''
   Problems of settling the immigrants have been exacerbated by
political instability since the collapse March 15 of the coalition
government of the right-wing Likud bloc and center-left Labor Party.
   Among other things, it delayed appropriation of an extra $1
billion for the program.
   Private programs have been organized, but they help only a
relative few of the newcomers.
   For example, SATEC, a small high-tech firm in Jerusalem that
hired Kislik, was founded two years ago to hire Soviet scientists.
Australian businessman Joseph Gunick put up $3 million.
   The company, which makes digital electricity meters and
technology to extract gold from low-grade ores, employs 35 recent
arrivals from the Soviet Union. Scientific director Herman
Branover, who came from the Soviet Union in 1972, said the company
was making a modest profit.
   SATEC remains unique. Branover said he tried to duplicate it,
but failed because foreign investors would not finance high-risk
ventures in a country with unstable politics and an infamous
bureaucracy.
   ``I'm very angry, especially with the American Jews,'' Branover
said. ``They have been marching for years on Fifth Avenue, shouting
`Let my people go'. Now that the Russians are indeed coming, the
American Jews are doing very little.''
   Rubin, the adviser to Shamir, said any government employment
program for Soviet professionals must focus on investment in
high-tech firms. As a way to lure foreign capital, Rubin said, he
had proposed that the government guarantee two-thirds of an
investment.
   He predicted rising unemployment, tax increases and a reduction
in social services for all Israelis because of an immigration rate
that, on a per capita basis, would amount to 20 million arrivals a
year in the United States.
   Branover said most of the newcomers were ready to make
sacrifices.
   ``We have people here who used to be managers of giant factories
with 5,000 employees, and they are happy to get a job as a simple
engineer,'' he said.
   Kislik, 54, knows about sacrifices.
   After requesting permission to emigrate to Israel in 1973, he
was sent to a Soviet labor camp for three years, confined to a
psychiatric hospital for a month and beaten repeatedly by agents of
the KGB secret police.
   His wife divorced him. He couldn't work as a scientist, and made
a living as a bookbinder and ticket seller in Kiev.
   He longs to work again in nuclear physics, but has resigned
himself to analyzing coal ashes in his tiny lavender cubicle at

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some facts and figures about the
immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NUMBERS _ A total of 160,426 Soviet Jews settled in Israel
between 1971 and 1988. More than 35,000 have arrived so far in 1990
and up to 150,000 are expected by year's end. About 1 million are
expected to have applied by the end of summer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COSTS _ The government has budgeted the equivalent of $2.2
billion for 1990 and will need $3 billion annually to settle
150,000 Jews a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HOUSING _ Construction is to begin this year on 70,000
apartments, including 45,000 public housing units. Despite that,
the Central Bank predicts a shortage of 29,000 units in 1990 and
62,000 in 1992.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE IMMIGRANTS _ About 75 percent are under 55 years old, and 54
percent have academic degrees. In every 100,000, there are 11,222
engineers, 2,608 doctors and dentists, 2,642 teachers, 1,713
computer programmers, 1,072 mathematicians and physicists, 1,399
accountants, 1,008 carpenters, 697 painters and 23 piano repairmen.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BENEFITS PROVIDED _ The benefits package for each immigrant
totals $11,500. A family of three is entitled to a rent subsidy of
$238 the first year, $188 for the second and $125 for the third
year, plus a living allowance of $400 a month for two years or
until work is found.

   Rain has poured down all morning,
but as the trail dips into rain forest, any thoughts of discomfort
vanish amid the lush undergrowth.
   There is almost a sense of entering a sanctuary as the damp
ground cover muffles the thud of boots. The only sounds are water
dripping from the canopy of branches onto huge ferns, the gurgle of
a distant brook and the occasional trill or shriek of an unseen
bird.
   The fresh scent of rain mingles with the smells of the verdant
forest.
   Sunlight begins to break through the low-hanging trees,
vibrantly highlighting every possible shade of green. Rocks and
limbs are covered with moss so thick it seems possible to take a
nap and wake up covered with it.
   After a few hours, the trail climbs above the tree line to
reveal stunning views of deep blue lakes below and craggy mountains
still covered with snow in late summer. Clouds begin to move back
in, obscuring the sheer cliffs of distant fjords in mist.
   This is hiking in New Zealand, which attracts nature lovers from
thousands of miles away. Even the main industries help create an
idyllic landscape: rolling green hills of rich farmland and pasture
dotted with millions of sheep.
   Hiking and bicycling seem a way of life for the hardy residents,
who protect and enjoy their environment. They have built thousands
of miles of hiking trails that are virtually free of debris.
   In most places, the water remains clean enough to drink from the
streams. At night, the sky is so clear the bright stars barely
twinkle; only a sliver of moon is needed to see clearly without a
flashlight.
   For those tired of carrying and pitching tents, many trails have
the added advantage of communal wooden huts that provide warmth and
shelter. They also offer a welcome bit of camaraderie for people of
various nationalities, who range from couples carrying infants to
people in their early 70s.
   A few huts are near hot springs, where a long soak can ease the
aches of a day's hiking. Shelters on the most popular trails fill
quickly, especially in peak seasons, so early arrivals get the
bunks and latecomers sleep on the floor.
   It's lovely to fall asleep with rain drumming on the roof, but
there are some inherent problems with communal living. Not the
least of them are people who snore and others who like late parties.
   Many of the trails, known here as tracks, are far from easy. New
Zealanders don't seem fond of switchbacks, preferring instead to
challenge their legs and lungs with more direct routes up and down
the rough terrain.
   One particularly tough track rises to a ridge 3,569 feet above
the valley in a series of steps carved from the hillside, through a
boulder field and over an ankle-wrenching stretch of loose rock
called scree.
   Whatever the difficulties, there's nothing like the isolation of
hiking down a mountain as the early morning fog rises, blanketing
everything in a shroud of white. Only the sound of your footsteps
and the trickle of distant, glacier-fed waterfalls break the
silence.
   It is like visiting an alien planet to trek across the desolate
crater of an inactive volcano, where lakes of startling green
contrast with gray volcanic dust.
   New Zealand offers numerous coves and rushing rivers that are
ideal for canoeing or white-water rafting. There are streems and
lakes rich in trout, black sand beaches for those who want a rest.
   Wildlife includes albatrosses with 10-foot wingspans, colonies
of seals and penguins, mischievous mountain parrots called keas and
the reticent, flightless kiwi bird that has become the national
symbol.
   The weather often consists of surprises, and good rain gear is a
must. Forecasting seems more guesswork than science, particularly
on the South Island's west coast, where rainfall may reach 300
inches a year.
   Sunshine turns quickly to brooding clouds, which spew downpours
and give way to sun again. Trails can change to small streams, dirt
to mud, solid footholds to slick rock and roots.
   Sandflies are probably the worst curse of hiking in New Zealand.
The tiny insects swarm and bite, sometimes drawing blood.
   They move slowly, however, which means a good walking pace can
leave them behind. Repellants generally drive them off and they
disappear at night.
   Keas, found in higher elevations, are covered with thick green
feathers that often reveal an undercovering of red while in flight.
Sometimes, they take hikers by surprise with low passes and loud
screeches.
   If humans give them food, they don't have to spend all day
hunting it, which leaves time for mischief that sometimes borders
on the malicious.
   They have been known to tear up boots, backpacks and bicycle
seats with their sharp, powerful beaks. A traveler told of two keas
that cooperated in an attempt to fly off with his bicycle helmet.

<HEAD>Video Game Glasnost: Soviet's Tetris Hooks American Players</HEAD>

   Video game junkies now have an alternative to
the zapping, blasting and pulverizing of the shoot-'em-up
adventures popular on the fantasy screen.
   Tetris, an addictive brain-twisting game, has no combat, no
karate chops, no chases and no characters, not even a story line
like the Super Mario Brothers.
   This video cerebral challenge features building blocks _ Soviet
blocks, that is. Created by a Soviet scientist, Tetris is the first
communist bloc video game to hit it big in the free market.
   ``It's a moving puzzle,'' said Richard Epstein, 43, of
Parsippany, N.J. ``When I can't sleep, instead of reading a book, I
play Tetris.''
   ``I like the action games, but this is the first real strategy
game,'' said David Rodriguez, 16, of New York City. ``You just
can't stop.''
   Since its introduction to the world two years ago, Tetris sales
have sizzled.
   About 4 million copies are in use in homes, offices and arcades,
mostly in the United States and Japan. The U.S. Software Publishers
Association gave it four awards last year, including best original
game and best entertainment program.
   Its creator is chain-smoking Alexey Pazhitnov, 35, a researcher
at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow who developed it in his spare
time on his home computer, which is as rare as well-stocked food
shelves in his homeland.
   ``When people started to play, they couldn't stop,'' Pazhitnov
told an interviewer on a tour of the United States earlier this
year. ``The game was like a fire.''
   Tetris is somewhat of an electronic Rubik's Cube, and its
creator prefers wizardry to war.
   ``I don't like the violent games. I hate shooting games,''
Pazhitnov said. ``My idea is to make constructive games, not one
where you destroy things.''
   Tetris features seven geometric figures _ rods, squares,
zigzags, L-shapes and a squat T _ each made up of four blocks. The
name is derived from the Greek word ``tetra,'' which means four.
   A shape selected at random falls on the screen, and the player
can turn it on its side, steer where it goes and control how fast
it falls. The object is to arrange the falling blocks in solid rows
across the width of the screen, something that appeals to
obsessive-compulsives and problem-solvers.
   Filling in all the blanks does two things: It scores points and
also makes the line disappear to allow room for more shapes.
   If the blanks aren't filled in, the blocks pile up like bricks
in a wall. The game goes on until the screen fills up, which can
take minutes or hours, depending on skill levels.
   The game was adapted to personal computer software by a comrade,
a teen-age ``khaker,'' or Russian for hacker. It spread to Eastern
Europe and then to England, where an enterprising London capitalist
scooped up the rights and peddled it to Spectrum HoloByte of
Alameda, Calif., which marketed the game for personal computers.
   Since 1988, Spectrum has sold 150,000 copies at $39.95 each.
   But the real action came last fall when Tetris became available
on the Nintendo Entertainment System, which controls 80 percent of
the U.S. home video market and has been the hottest selling
Christmas toy three years in a row.
   About 1.5 million Tetris games at $34.95 each were sold in the
past six months, the company said.
   Nintendo also put the puzzle on its Game Boy, an $89 hand-held
unit about the size of a paperback book. Two million copies of
Tetris now belong to Game Boy owners.
   Another video power, Sega, adapted Tetris for video arcades.
   But compulsion hasn't meant riches for Pazhitnov. The game is
marketed through ELORG, the Soviet Foreign Trade Association, and
all profits go to the Academy of Sciences.
   Pazhitnov already has made a sequel called Welltris, a
three-dimensional version honored this year by the Software
Publishers, and has other games due out soon.
   After years of plotting to export ideology and weaponry, the
Soviets have found a smash with technology. But if the United
States can send Bon Jovi, McDonald's and Estee Lauder to Moscow,
why not a Soviet video game enthralling American kids?
   Although American parents and educators cringe at the time kids
spend playing video games, one teacher believes Tetris can blast
classroom boredom while it fosters spatial learning _ the stuff of
which IQ tests are made.
   And it comes without the violence found in games such as Blaster
Master or Mega Man 2.
   ``There's a whole lot of high-order thinking going on. In its
own way, it reveals a bit of the beauty of geometry,'' said David
Thornburg, director of the Thornburg Center for Professional
Development in Mountain View, Calif.
   ``These video games have got these kids thinking. They're not
killing time,'' Thornburg said. ``We could do a whole lot to
benefit our students if we could find out what makes them play
video games and capture that enthusiasm for history, mathematics
and language arts.''
   Tetris junkies rarely think about geometric equations and
classroom motivation when consumed by a game, however.
   They're too preoccupied with the shapes dribbling down their
screens.
   ``I've seen those shapes in my sleep,'' said Cindy Quinn, 29,
who uses a computer in her job with a New York credit card company.
   ``I've played it in the morning a couple of times and it made me
late for work. You can't stop playing,'' she said. ``It's such a
disorderly world. There's something about making things fit.''

<HEAD>CNN, Once Called ``Chicken Noodle News,'' Celebrates 10th Year
Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began 10 years ago today with 300 employees,
$400 million in start-up costs and 12 bureaus. But critics who
laughingly called it `Chicken Noodle News'' then are eating crow
now.
   Ted Turner's Cable News Network, originally seen in only 1.7
million U.S. homes, now is in 54 million. It has nearly 1,800
staffers and 27 bureaus worldwide and is seen in 90 countries,
including the Soviet Union. And it became profitable in 1985.
   That the 24-hour network is a global presence as well as a
big-league rival of the news divisions of ABC, CBS and NBC was
neatly noted during the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone
for ``Today,'' asked if a TV station there was describing what was
going on.
   ``Well,'' the man replied, ``they're actually relaying the CNN
broadcast.''
   Such recognition, by either a man in Panama or world leaders,
was an uncertain dream when Ed Turner _ no relation to Ted _
reported for duty at CNN's temporary offices in Atlanta six months
before operations began.
   Battle stations were in an ancient building resembling, well, an
ideal fixer-upper. Turner, now CNN's executive vice president,
recalls that ``it looked like something off of Tobacco Road, only
not that nice.''
   Turner is a veteran of more than 20 years in news, including a
stop at CBS, where he produced the ``CBS Morning News.''
   He was running an Oklahoma City station when CNN beckoned.
   ``They said, `Come on down and try,''' says Turner, a native
Oklahoman with a deadpan sense of humor. ``And who could say no to
something that everybody said was going to be a sure failure?''
   Ted Turner himself became a recruiter, according to a new book,
``CNN: The Inside Story.'' It says he tried to hire ... Walter
Cronkite. The famous, respected then-CBS anchorman politely and
indirectly said no.
   Lesser news stars who nonetheless also were respected said yes.
   They included two who became the best-known of CNN's original
anchors: Mary Alice Williams from New York's WNBC-TV _ she returned
to NBC last April _ and Bernard Shaw, a no-nonsense former Marine
from ABC who still is at CNN in Washington.
   When he joined CNN, had he any feelings he might be joining the
crew of television's Titanic? ``No,'' Shaw says, ``I'm a good
swimmer.''
   Network news still was riding high and considered The Place to
Work when Ed Turner joined CNN. But he found few cries of ``you
must be mad'' when recruiting CNN's grunts _ reporters, producers,
writers, bureau chiefs.
   ``Generally, they were interested,'' he says. ``It was trying to
sell the wife, or the husband, as the case may be. But the desire
to gamble was considerable among the journalists. A lot of them
said, `Why not?'''
   The arguments against were considerable: low pay, long hours, no
unions where possible and the distinct chance that at any minute
the whole shebang might go poof. Indeed, CNN lost $16 million its
first year.
   But local TV news had burgeoned in the 1970s, Turner notes, and
many younger local newsies were ready for the majors. But the
networks were full up.
   ``We came along at the right time,'' he says.
   The new arrivals, he says, ``hadn't been tainted by exposure to
the other networks, where in those days they had so much help and
logistical support, and so many nice limousines, it'd ruin you from
remembering to go out and get a story.''
   The hardest part, he says, was getting recognition, from
advertisers, newsmakers and viewers. That long since has been
solved, particularly among Washington's movers and shakers.
   It wasn't always so in that hamlet, one of the last major cities
to get cable. That's why CNN in its early days gave away satellite
dishes to the White House, the Pentagon and the House and Senate,
says Turner.
   But he thinks the real turning point came at the 1984 Democratic
convention in San Francisco, when CNN got a booth, just like the
Big Three, overlooking the convention floor:
   ``That to me,'' he says, ``was a symbol of `There's a new
big-time player around, folks.'''
   That player now isn't seen only on cable or what it says are
950,000 hotel rooms _ 700,000 in the U.S. and Canada and the
balance abroad.
   Some of its reports also are seen on the news programs of 250
U.S. stations that are CNN affiliates, Turner says. Significantly,
the majority _ 160 _ also are network affiliates.
   But Turner, while he enjoys needling the networks, doesn't
believe the nightly network newscasts that once ruled the national
news roost are going the way of the pterodactyl _ at least not all
three.
   ``I think that they will survive in some form, perhaps not as
formal half-hours, but as update services or feeds to their
affiliate stations. One or two may continue (in their present
form). But they have to find a new editorial presentation.''
   That, he says, is because it is a different game now, with CNN
going strong and many local news operations airing national and
international reports before Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan
Rather start their newscasts.
   As Turner sees things, a big problem for the Big Three is that
``the surprise factor _ the `Hey, Martha, come here and look' _ is
gone.''

   In the world of national children's rights
crusader Faye Yager, a shadowy Satanic brotherhood manipulates the
nation's courts, haunts its police departments and allows children
to suffer unspeakable evil.
   A 30-room English Tudor mansion _ complete with housekeeper,
gardener and gray Rolls Royce parked outside _ protects Mrs. Yager
from that world.
   It is the headquarters for her underground network, through which
she says thousands of volunteers in all 50 states hide hundreds of
children.
   Police came to the house in April with a search warrant, looking
for files or videotapes to back up a Florida woman's claim that Mrs.
Yager tried to browbeat the woman's children into accusing their
father of Satanism and abuse.
   Since Mrs. Yager's arrest April 14 on related charges, Cobb
County police have received calls from throughout the country, many
on behalf of fathers who hope the network will be dismantled and
their missing children returned, said police Lt. Robert Pittman.
   ``It's very frustrating to a father who's been cleared of any
wrongdoing whatsoever to know there's a nationwide organization
whose avowed purpose is to remove children from the jurisdiction of
our courts,'' said Thomas A. Massey, an Evansville, Ind., attorney.
   Massey represents John Rademacher, whose ex-wife and 8-year-old
daughter, Sara, have been missing since last November, presumably
hidden in Mrs. Yager's network.
   Authorities seized about 40 files and tapes from Mrs. Yager's
home, but she said the network is safe.
   ``I'm not stupid. I don't keep anything that's going to lead to
any kids. But they don't know that,'' she said.
   A former interior designer, Mrs. Yager, 40, started Children of
the Underground three years ago to shelter abuse victims she
believes have been abandoned by the court system. She estimates she
has helped at least 500 families, with one to six children each.
   The case against Mrs. Yager, which is expected to go before a
grand jury this summer, involves a Florida woman who said she asked
the organization for protection because her husband physically
abused her, their 8-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son.
   Mrs. Yager is charged with kidnapping the boy and subjecting him
to cruel verbal treatment; a kidnapping charge involving the girl
later was reduced to interfering with the custody of a child.
   Police contend Mrs. Yager threatened to send the children back to
their father, who she said would beat them, if they refused to make
accusations against him.
   Cobb County District Attorney Tom Charron described Mrs. Yager as
a woman with good intentions who has become obsessed.
   Mrs. Yager denies the criminal charges. But she does not entirely
disagree with Charron's assessment.
   ``I am obsessed,'' she conceded during an interview at her home
in an affluent Sandy Springs neighborhood in suburban Atlanta. ``I'm
obsessed with a legal system, a system designed to protect that
destroys. I'm obsessed with this cult business that is allowed to
operate. These people are Ozzie and Harriet by day and get away with
it.''
   She claims many prominent lawyers and judges are ``generational
Satanists'' brought up to believe in Satan.
   In the basement file cabinet where she files records by state,
``cult'' cases are earmarked with bright orange tabs.
   Seated on a settee in a room surrounded by antiques, she strings
together story after story of children who say they were abused,
many by fathers or relatives involved in the occult. In a voice
often just above a whisper, she talks of girls used as Satanic
``breeders'' to carry fetuses that their tormentors later sacrifice.
   At times, she stops to introduce a grandmother who works with the
network, or to chat with an abused teen-ager. The youth is one of
the changing number of house guests that vary with her caseload, she
said.
   The case against her, Mrs. Yager vowed, never will go to trial.
She contends the police and FBI agents assisting in the
investigation are harassing her family and trying to destroy her
credibility, especially among law enforcement officials who trusted
her.
   ``My credibility has been tarnished, tarred and feathered. I've
been slandered,'' she said.
   Her history with Cobb County authorities dates back to 1973, when
the courts awarded custody of her own daughter, Michelle, to the
child's father, Roger Lee Jones, even though Mrs. Yager claimed he
had sexually abused the girl.
   She launched her underground crusade in 1987, the year after
Jones was indicted on nine counts of child molestation involving
three minors in Venice, Fla. He still awaits trial on the charges.
   Memories of what happened to her daughter, who now lives with
Mrs. Yager and her third husband, keep her bent on helping other
children, she said.
   FBI Agent Jeff Holmes accompanied police on the search of Mrs.
Yager's house a few days after her arrest, but won't say whether the
FBI has undertaken a broad investigation of the network.
   Charron said that until the missing children or the locations
where they are being hidden are found, authorities can do nothing.
   ``Until you have the children or proof of where they are, you
don't have the elements of a crime,'' he said.
   Any broad action involving the network would be up to the FBI
because Cobb County has limited jurisdiction, Charron said.
   Mrs. Yager's critics call her a media princess carried away with
publicity.
   Denise Gooch, one of the founders of a national group called the
Mothers Alliance for the Rights of Children, which Mrs. Yager also
helped start, described her as a ``reporter's dream and a parent's
nightmare.''
   She was asked to leave because of philosophical differences
shortly after the group started, and began her own network the same
year, said another founder, Sarah King.
   Mrs. Yager admits she doesn't shun attention.
   She traveled to a preliminary hearing in Cobb County in her
husband's Rolls Royce, driven by her gardener. Wearing a hat, a
flowered dress and a corsage, she listened as her attorney argued
she should not bear court costs because she is indigent.
   ``Howard Yager doesn't have to pay for attorneys for his wife. I
have no income,'' she said, adding that she transferred her property
and money into her husband's name before starting the underground.
   Authorities have criticized Mrs. Yager's interview techniques
with children, contending she intimidates them and often introduces
the subject of Satanism.
   ``She's not objective,'' said Pittman, the Cobb County police
lieutenant. ``We feel she intimidates the child into saying things
that aren't true.''
   Some videotapes, Pittman said, show Mrs. Yager ``screaming and
hollering at kids, threatening to send them back into an abusive
situation.''
   Mrs. Yager, who has the children sit in a high-backed
Renaissance-style chair in her library while she videotapes them,
denied she is abusive.
   ``I'm very blunt about things,'' she said. ``I tell them, `You're
at the end of the road. If I can't help you, not many people out
there are going to.'''
   She also denied bringing up Satanism, saying, ``I don't want to
believe things like that are going on. I'm being forced to believe
it.''
   Helen Russell, a friend who has watched some of the interviews,
defended Mrs. Yager's style and her findings about cults.
   ``Isn't it easier to think one woman is crazy,'' Mrs. Russell
asked, ``than to think our society has gotten so perverted?''

<HEAD>California, North Carolina Races Top Primary Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A bitter primary campaign for governor of California is winding
down in a flurry of television commercials while North Carolina
Democrats are choosing a challenger to Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
All told, candidates in nine states are vying for support Tuesday,
1990's busiest primary election day so far.
   Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp have spent months
attacking each other's positions on abortion, the death penalty and
how to deal with California's $3.6 billion budget deficit.
   Polls suggested their race was a dead heat as they entered the
last weekend of the primary campaign.
   On the Republican side, Sen. Pete Wilson faced only token primary
opposition and sat on a huge campaign war chest as he waited to
learn which Democrat would be his opponent in the race to succeed
retiring Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican.
   In North Carolina, Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley were in a runoff
for the Democratic Senate nomination. Gantt, the former mayor of
Charlotte, finished first in a six-way primary May 8, but failed to
get the 40 percent necessary to avoid a runoff with the second-place
finisher.
   Meanwhile, Helms has started running television ads accusing the
Democrats of throwing mud at him.
   Voters also will go to the polls Tuesday in Alabama, Iowa,
Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.
   In Alabama, five Democrats were battling for the right to
challenge Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican elected governor of
the state since Reconstruction. The contenders were state Attorney
General Don Siegelman, former Gov. Fob James, U.S. Rep. Ronnie
Flippo, state Sen. Charles Bishop, and Paul Hubbert, executive
director of the Alabama Education Association.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Republican state Sen. Bill
Cabannis were assured of their party nominations, setting up a
face-off in November.
   Abortion was the big issue in Iowa, where three Democrats were
vying to take on GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, an opponent of legalized
abortion. The Iowa chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action
League endorsed Don Avenson, speaker of the Iowa House, a move that
provoked an angry response from banker John Chrystal, who, like
Avenson, supports legal abortion.
   NARAL's decision to weigh in on the race was believed aimed at
the third Democrat, Attorney General Tom Miller, an opponent of
abortion. Miller was an early favorite in the race and NARAL leaders
were concerned the fall election would be between two opponents of
abortion.
   In the Senate primary in Iowa, incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin and
his GOP challenger, Rep. Tom Tauke, were assured of their party
nominations.
   Another crowded field was battling in Democratic and Republican
gubernatorial primaries in New Mexico, where incumbent Garrey
Carruthers, a Republican, was ineligible to seek a second term.
   For the first time in the state's history, the governor elected
in 1990 will be allowed to serve two consecutive four-year terms.
   The leading contenders on the Democratic side were Albuquerque
lawyer Paul Bardacke and rancher Bruce King, who already has served
eight years as governor, elected first in 1970 and again in 1978.
   Regarded as the top GOP contenders were Frank Bond, a former
legislator and education commissioner, and Les Houston, the
Republican leader of the state Senate.
   Four Republicans were competing in Montana to challenge
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. Two years ago, underdog GOP challenger
Conrad Burns toppled Democratic Sen. John Melcher, and the
Republicans are hoping to repeat that success this year. Vying to
take on Baucus were Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad, state Sen. Bill Farrell,
and businessmen John Domenech and Bruce Vorhauer.
   Abortion was an issue in a three-way congressional primary in New
Jersey. state Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen and state Sen.
Richard A. Zimmer, supporters of the pro-choice position, were
competing with professional football player Phil McConkey, an
abortion opponent, for the GOP nomination. The winner will face
Democrat Marguerite Chandler in November for the House seat held by
James Courter, the defeated GOP candidate for governor in 1989.
   The leading candidates in the Democratic primary to fill the
House seat formerly held by Democrat James Florio, the winner of
last year's campaign for governor of New Jersey, were Linda Bowker,
president of the state chapter of the National Organization for
Women and Camden County official Robert E. Andrews. Gloucester
County official Daniel Mangini had no opposition in the Republican
primary.
   The November lineups were virtually assured for Senate races in
New Jersey and New Mexico, where Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republican Pete Domenici were heavily favored for re-election. In
South Dakota, Republican Larry Pressler will be challenged in
November by Democrat Ted Muenster. In Mississippi, no Democrat filed
to oppose Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.
   Abortion was just one of the issues raised in the heated
California gubernatorial primary.
   The California governor's office was the biggest prize in the
1990 elections. The Democrats control the legislature and if they
can recapture the governor's office, the party will have the
political advantage next year when lines are redrawn for the state's
congressional districts. With 45 seats, California already has the
largest House delegation and the state is expected to gain six more
as a result of the 1990 Census.
   The Republicans recruited Wilson, re-elected to the Senate in
1988, to run for governor. Van de Kamp, the state attorney general,
was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But Feinstein,
the former mayor of San Francisco, surprised many observers with the
strength of her campaign.
   A supporter of the death penalty, Feinstein contrasted her
position with Van de Kamp's opposition to capital punishment. She
also suggested that as a woman, her pro-choice credentials were
stronger than Van de Kamp's.
   Van de Kamp said he personally opposes capital punishment but
would uphold California's death penalty, and countered with a
commercial saying he had put or kept 277 murderers on death row. His
most recent ad features an endorsement from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, who labels Feinstein ``a Republican in Democratic clothing.''
   While the Democratic contenders were spending millions on
commercials in the primary, Wilson has raised close to $10 million
while facing only token primary opposition.
   Also on the ballot in California were two Republican-backed
propositions designed to dilute the legislature's power of
redistricting. One would require any plan to pass by a two-thirds
vote of both chambers, the other would remove it entirely and place
it in the hands of a non-partisan commission. Democrats oppose both
proposals.
   In North Carolina, Gantt, bidding to become the first black
Democrat ever elected to the Senate, and Easley have spent more time
attacking Helms than each other.
   And now the Republican senator has responded with an animated
television ad that shows a wooded scene with flowers blooming and
birds chirping. It then shifts to a bullet-riddled photo of Helms
nailed to a tree and closes with a blob of mud hitting the picture.
A voice then says, ``Isn't it nice that Mike Easley and Harvey Gantt
aren't running negative campaigns?''

   Xiong Rucheng remembers the day he and his
colleagues at the Yunnan Public Health Bureau learned that drug
addicts near the border with Burma had contracted AIDS.
   ``No one could believe it,'' said Xiong, chairman of the bureau's
foreign affairs office. ``How could China have AIDS?''
   In Septembr, they sent the report to officials at the Ministry of
Public Health in Beijing, who didn't believe it either.
   ``They said, `We'll help you clear this up','' Xiong said, but
after testing the 50 samples three times, ``they finally believed
us.''
   He said 146 drug addicts out of nearly 6,000 tested had been
found to carry the HIV virus.
   Previously, only seven Chinese were known to have contracted
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the deadly disease that weakens
the body's immune system, making it susceptible to infections.
   They either were hemophiliacs infected by contaminated blood
products or had contracted AIDS overseas or through homosexual
relations with a foreigner, according to official reports.
   AIDS victims in Yunnan are drug addicts who used contaminated
needles.
   Chinese health authorities had targeted coastal cities, where
contact with foreigners is most common, in their efforts to prevent
AIDS from entering China.
   ``How did they know it would be found in far-off Yunnan, a
minority area, where the people are honest and unsophisticated?''
Xiong said. ``How could such a place have contracted the most
frightening disease of the modern age?''
   Yunnan is a poor, remote, mountainous province in southwestern
China that is home to nearly half the country's minorities.
   Nearly all the AIDS victims were found in Ruili, an area on the
Burmese frontier that is closed to foreigners. Chinese visitors
describe it as a wild, dangerous place full of traders and smugglers
from Nepal, Pakistan, Laos and Burma.
   In Ruili, drug users prefer injecting heroin to smoking opium,
Xiong said.
   He said 80 percent of the AIDS carriers were of the Dai minority,
only one was a woman, and none had begun showing symptoms of AIDS.
   All continue to lead normal lives and have not been told they
have AIDS, Xiong said.

<HEAD>Christians Flee to Moslem Areas; Sectarian Amity Rekindled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Moslem and Christian families are
reaching out to help each other survive, finding common ground in
the suffering wrought by 15 years of civil war.
   Mazen, a Sunni Moslem who lives in Moslem west Beirut, ran the
gantlet of snipers to drive into east Beirut to rescue Joseph and
his family, Christian friends trapped by fighting between Christian
factions.
   ``I knew I could get killed, but these are my friends,'' Mazen
said. ``I couldn't bear the idea of them under that murderous
shelling, without food or water. I knew that if I didn't bring them
... they'd never think of coming here.''
   Mazen, Joseph and several Christians interviewed after fleeing
east Beirut asked not to be identified further. The Christians fear
being harassed or killed by the warring factions if they return to
Christian east Beirut.
   The 15-year-old civil war has created religious and psychological
barriers for many Lebanese, deepening the sectarian divisions that
always have festered.
   Now, some of those barriers are eroding because of the suffering
inflicted on Christians by the months-long battle between the forces
of rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese
Forces militia.
   Police say more than 200,000 people have fled the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north and east of Beirut, where 1 million lived
before the battle began Jan. 30.
   Tens of thousands, like Joseph and his family, have found
sanctuary in Moslem areas. Some returned to villages they fled years
ago.
   It is impossible to predict whether the new Christian-Moslem
coexistence will expand or help end the war, in which about 150,000
people have been killed.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 wounded,
most of them civilians, in the fight for control of the Christian
enclave. It is the worst fighting between Christians since the civil
war began in April 1975.
   Many Christians fled Lebanon through the port of Jounieh, north
of Beirut, where ferries from Cyprus regularly run through shellfire
to pick them up.
   Street fighting in the enclave eventually blocked roads to
Jounieh, however, and thousands of people like Joseph found
themselves with no choice but Moslem areas as a refuge.
   They also found an unexpected welcome.
   ``The Moslems didn't kill us and eat our flesh as we'd been told
by the Lebanese Forces,'' Joseph said, relaxing in Mazen's house
with his wife, Ferial, their 6-year-old son, Tony, and baby daughter
Rana.
   ``We've made a lot of Moslem friends here. We have breakfast with
one family at their home and we're invited to lunch at another. We
meet these people every day now.''
   ``Our Moslem friends shower the children with toys and clothes,
although my financial situation is far better than theirs,'' said
the 36-year-old real estate agent.
   Lebanon has at least 17 Christian and Moslem sects that lived
side-by-side for decades, usually in clearly defined areas, but
often in mixed communities. It was a fragile unity, but it worked.
   The region north of Beirut was the heartland of Maronite
Catholics, the dominant Christian sect. Maronites controlled the
government, parliament, judiciary and army after Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, which fostered jealousy and
animosity among Moslems.
   After the war began, Christians were driven from Moslem areas in
the Chouf Mountains, west Beirut and the coastal plain south of the
capital.
   Many Christians have remained in west Beirut, expecially leftist
Greek Orthodox, But tens of thousands of refugees, mostly Maronites,
packed into east Beirut and the shrinking Christian enclave.
   Joseph and Mazen were introduced eight years ago by a mutual
friend, an army officer now fighting for Aoun. They kept in touch
and Mazen regularly slipped into east Beirut to visit.
   Mazen said he decided to try rescuing Joseph's family because ``I
knew they would never think of seeking refuge in west Beirut.''
   He set out in his small car during an afternoon lull in shelling
and entered east Beirut through the Museum Crossing, the only
gateway between the two sectors.
   ``There was a lot of sniper fire,'' he said. ``I had to take a
long way around to Joseph's house. ... The trip normally takes 15
minutes. That day it took me two hours. ... Joseph had mixed
feelings about coming with me to west Beirut, but I insisted.
   ``Finally, I asked him, `Do you think you and your kids can take
much more of this?' He said no, and we started packing.''
   Joseph said: ``I realized that if we stayed in east Beirut, we'd
be committing suicide. Our house had already been hit. It was either
die ... or take our chances in west Beirut.''
   Christians who sought refuge at the Sunni Moslem Ibbad el-Rahman
mosque in west Beirut also were overwhelmed by Moslem hospitality.
   ``They gave us mattresses, pillows and blankets,'' said a woman
who gave her name as Hala. ``They give us everything we ask for _
meat, rice, bread and water.''
   Hala fled to the Moslem sector a few weeks ago with her
11-year-old daughter, her sister, niece and mother.
   Abu George, a farmer, is among about 70,000 Christians who have
sought sanctuary in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern
Lebanon.
   ``We were living on the edge of death,'' he said. ``After several
days in the underground shelter, we ran out of water, flour and
food.''
   He took his seven children for his old village of Deir al-Ahmar,
where they were given a welcome he was not sure they would receive.
   ``It was like going from hell to heaven,'' he said.
   Another 80,000 Christians have gone to south Lebanon, including
many families who were driven out of the region years ago.
   Some found Moslem squatters, themselves refugees, living in their
old homes. Many of the Moslems agreed to share the houses.
   Most villages around the hill town of Majdelyoun were occupied by
Moslem families who abandoned their own ancestral homes in the
Israeli-occupied zone just north of the border.
   ``They've been displaced like us,'' said Fadwa, a housewife with
two children who returned to Majdelyoun from east Beirut.
   ``We've been living together for the past few weeks and we're
having a great time. The kids play together and the women prepare
lunch.''

<HEAD>`Senior Officials' Busy Spinning the Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Summit time has been prime time for The Senior
Administration Official.
   Senior Official is the identity assigned to the government
experts who provide background, detail and the administration's
viewpoint on events like the current summit conference.
   There's been more than one of him and her in the summit buildup,
but they spoke with a single, authoritative voice, under briefing
rules that do not permit further identification.
   The official is no newcomer to Washington. The briefing system
has been around for years, used by successive administrations to
tell their stories on such events as a presidential mission abroad
or a major policy statement at home. That is done under what are
called background rules, in which a source of information provides
it only on condition of anonymity.
   It doesn't always work out. White House chief of staff John
Sununu has had trouble with the system, complaining earlier this
year about the use of anonymous sources by reporters, then appearing
in the briefing room prepared to speak under senior official
anonymity rules. Reporters protested the contradiction, but he
refused to put his briefing on the record.
   More recently, Sununu said under background rules that President
Bush's no-conditions terms for budget negotiations did not mean he
would tolerate a tax increase, only that Democrats were free to
propose one. He made the comments as a senior official, aboard an
airplane on which he was the only senior official, so the cover
didn't hold. That put the budget talks in jeopardy until the White
House promised again that Bush would set no conditions.
   Sometimes, officials say they can speak more candidly on
background, without attribution, than on the record, with names
attached. But it is not unusual for an official to hold an
unattributed background session one day and show up on network
television the next morning, saying much the same things.
   Sometimes the background rule is set by an official who says he
doesn't want to be identified because he isn't supposed to be
talking for publication. That's not the case when The Senior
Administration Official appears at formal White House briefings on
an event like the summit conference.
   The rule of anonymity is said to apply there because the briefers
often are technicians or negotiators, little known to the world
outside their specialties, and are not public figures or spokesmen
for the administration.
   It leaves a margin for error, since any slip is anonymous. It has
been described in past administrations as a system that permits
diplomats to speak without nailing them to positions that could be a
problem at a negotiating table.
   And it reserves the public stage to the people elected or
appointed to be there. President Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III both conducted on-the-record briefings and answered
summit questions at the same lectern The Senior Official uses.
   With and without attribution, the message from the White House
became a self-fulfilling prophecy of summit success, to be validated
Sunday morning as Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
hold a joint news conference on their meetings in Washington and at
Camp David, Md.
   One way that's been done is by trying to lower expectations, much
as a presidential candidate sometimes plays down his prospects in a
primary election, in order to claim victory in almost any outcome.
   So, with the United States and the Soviet Union in contradictory
and so far unyielding positions on the NATO status of a reunified
Germany, senior officialdom said nobody should expect that to be
resolved at the summit. Baker then made the same point in a Thursday
television interview, saying that ``involves a whole host of other
countries,'' not only the superpowers.
   Another positioning tactic is to make the most of what is
available. ``As we move from conflict to cooperation,'' White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said on Wednesday, ``agreements
reached on Thursday and Friday will provide for a realistic
foundation for the growing and changing U.S.-Soviet relationship.''
   Agreements are reached at summit meetings only in the sense that
they get a final endorsement there, with the signing of deals
negotiated in advance. When the most ambitious of those treaties
can't be nailed down in time for summit signatures, the skillful
Senior Administration Official puts the emphasis elsewhere, on deals
that can be reached and on progress that is not measured by a stack
of documents anyhow.
   Not that agreements aren't important, the Senior Official said,
but the real work of the summit was honest, frank dialogue, trying
to move two superpowers just a few steps closer together.
   Welcoming Gorbachev, Bush said that the most meaningful measure
of success is in ``the groundwork for overcoming decades of division
and discord.''
   And on that, scorecards that count points won and lost, or
agreements signed and shelved, really won't measure results.
   That will have to show in what happens in the months ahead, no
matter what is said now.

   The eroded soil swirling in the Smoky Hill
River after a hard rain is the legacy of sod-busting pioneers and
more than a century of poor farming practices.
   The Smoky Hill and other rivers look like a spilled cup of
heavily creamed coffee because they carry a muddy mix of water,
rich top soil and farm chemical residues.
   Ecologist Wes Jackson blames ``exploitative agriculture'' _
farming that relies on working the ground with heavy equipment and
tons of chemicals to fertilize crops and protect them from weeds
and pests.
   ``Mining the soil,'' he said, describing modern agriculture as a
carryover from the days when people farmed a patch of ground until
it was unproductive and then moved on.
   And agricultural chemicals, he said, are ``substances with which
our tissues have had no experience.''
   At 53, Jackson, founder of the Land Institute, has held to his
ideas long enough that admiration has replaced ridicule. He has
gone from the target of mocking barbs to a respected leader in the
sustainable agriculture movement, which seeks to reduce or
eliminate the use of chemicals and and change other consumptive
farming practices.
   The message from Jackson has been much the same as it has been
for 20 years. But the world around him has evolved, and he now sits
on a U.S. Department of Agriculture panel evaluating proposals for
low input sustainable agriculture, or LISA, research projects.
   He addressed an Earth Day crowd of 100,000 people at Lincoln
Park in Chicago.
   George Ham, a Kansas State University associate dean of
agriculture and former head of KSU's agronomy department, has a
cordial relationship with Jackson. They disagree on the definition
of sustainable agriculture and other points.
   ``I certainly recognize his professional background and
expertise and certainly recognize where he's coming from,'' Ham
said. ``In terms of our approaches to sustainability, ours is short
term while his is more long term.''
   For instance, Kansas State is helping farmers gradually decrease
the amount they plow and the quantities of chemicals they use.
   Jackson, however, looks to the day when the plowing and chemical
use would be, for the most part, eliminated.
   Ham agreed that agriculture has evolved and environmental
concerns now are more important. Kansas State is placing new
emphasis on looking at water quality and how chemicals move through
the soil, he said.
   ``An increasing number of people are finally recognizing that
agriculture itself is an ecological problem outranking industrial
pollution,'' Jackson said.
   ``A lot of the resistance to my ideas came from my well-known
stands on the Vietnam War, civil rights and the environment,''
Jackson said. ``People thought I was some kind of nut.''
   Even his wife, Dana, concedes he is outlandish. She says that's
why he is a sought-after speaker.
   And how receptive could farmers and agricultural academicians be
when a speaker refers to farming as ``the barbaric plunder of
nature'' and compares chemical treatment of soils and crops as
``fossil-fuel chemotherapy.''
   Jackson has chided farmers for wearing caps with seed and
chemical company logos ``advertising the corporate agribusiness
lords for whom they work.''
   And he said helping farmers cope day-to-day is like caring for a
cancer patient. ``This is noble work, but it is more for the
purpose of helping someone cope than it is to change the patient's
fate,'' he said.
   Jackson _ who has a bachelor's degree in biology, a master's
degree in botany and a doctorate in genetics _ has been a teacher
and lecturer for nearly three decades.
   He doesn't pretend to have answers for all the questions he
asks. He doesn't suggest farmers immediately abandon all chemicals
and tilling. He believes a radical political agenda and an as yet
undiscovered economy are needed to reform agriculture.
   The Land Institute, which Jackson and his wife founded in 1976,
uses the prairie as its standard for a new agriculture.
   Supported by foundations and a corps of individual donors, the
non-profit institute employs 13 people and has 10 interns each year
for a 43-week term of study. The interns receive $125 a month.
Preference is given to people who plan to earn graduate degrees and
work in the field of sustainable agriculture.
   Most of the work is targeted at developing a domestic prairie.
In technical terms, Jackson calls it ``a herbaceous perennial
seed-producing polyculture'' that wouldn't require fertilizer,
pesticides or herbicides. The legumes and seed-bearing grasses
grown for human and animal food wouldn't need annual plowing.
   Several plants show promise. They are Eastern gamma grass, a
high-protein warm season grass related to corn; leymus, a cool
season wild rye, and Illinois bundle flower, a native prairie
legume.
   Researchers also are working with a grain sorghum-Johnson grass
crossbreed. They hope to wed the domestic milo plant's grain
production with the noxious weed's perennial and winter hardiness
traits.
   Of the institute's 278 acres, 90 are native prairie and 50 are
replanted prairie. There are also a herbery, where more than 300
wild plants were transplanted for study, a 140-foot greenhouse, and
various test plots.
   A brick 1960s-era split-level rural home serves as
administrative and research offices. The Jacksons live in the small
home they built nearby in 1971.
   As the institute has grown, its budget has climbed from $16,000
a year to nearly $500,000.
   The time frame for results from work at The Land, as its backers
call it, is 25, 50 or 100 years. Even then the effort might not
reach its goals.
   But he is resolute about his calling.
   ``Let's find out from the ecology what it is about nature's
community that sees to it all the ecological bills get paid,'' he
said. ``What other choice do we have?''

   On windy days, when black clouds of soil
bury farm fences and blot out the sun baking North Dakota's
prairie, Don Nelson wonders if the loss of precious earth will ever
end.
   ``We're so hopelessly behind,'' Nelson said. ``With these winds
we've had, it sucked almost all the moisture out.''
   North Dakota, entering its third straight year of drought, leads
the nation in acres of land lost to wind erosion.
   Figures from the federal Soil Conservation Service show a record
1.6 million acres in North Dakota were damaged by wind erosion from
Nov. 1, 1989, through February. That compares with 474,200 acres
for the same four months of 1988-89.
   Farmers like Nelson are the underdogs in the fight to save the
soil.
   Nelson, 53, leads a double life. He does research and consults
with doctors as a pathologist at a Bismarck clinic, then dons a
plaid shirt, blue jeans and hat, lights up a cigar and heads for
his wheat and barley fields east of Bismarck.
   Farming is a life he has known since childhood in Beresford,
S.D., near Sioux Falls. But two years of drought have sapped the
moisture from his 3,000 acres, and Nelson has been fighting to keep
the soil from blowing away.
   ``This year, I'm going to do less tilling and use more
chemicals,'' Nelson vowed last week as he maneuvered a huge
planting drill into a shed.
   ``I don't know what the answer is. I'm beginning to think more
about continuous cropping. But we may not ever solve the problem.''
   The main problem comes on land left to rest before its next crop
is planted, Nelson said. The drought has reduced cover crops like
grasses and small grains that would keep the soil in place.
   Tilling leaves the soil more vulnerable to erosion, and
herbicides could seep into water supplies. Nelson, however, said
chemicals may be the lesser evil because they are not used as
intensely in North Dakota as in other states.
   Myron Senechal, a conservationist with the North Dakota Soil
Conservation Service, said farmers gradually are changing their
style of farming to cut down on erosion, mainly by tilling less.
   ``Producers are aware of the erosion out there,'' he said.
``It's a learning process we have to promote on a day-to-day
basis.''
   ``Part of the problem is the winter,'' adds Doug Gasseling,
state SCS agronomist. ``We've had 60-degree temperatures in
February, and it just broke the soil structure down. A lot of our
farmers didn't have moisture to start with.''
   The persistent drought also has taken an emotional toll. Rain
and snow that fell last week were the talk of the state, bringing
smiles to farmers' faces and a touch of green to the grass. But
much more is needed.
   ``I don't see signs yet that the pattern has changed,'' Nelson
said. ``As you get close to planting time, you think the drought
can end with a rainstorm. I was waiting the last two years for that
rainstorm, and it never came.''
   Nelson, who is unmarried, said his double life keeps him on the
go, but he likes it that way. He relaxes by going to medical
meetings.
   ``It's like dealing with nature in different levels. I probably
diagnosed 15 different cancers this morning and I don't know
whether I can control them. I know I can't control the drought.
   ``It gives you a pretty good vision of the magnitude of the
struggle,'' Nelson added. ``But I know eventually this drought is
going to end, and we're going to have good crops again. I think
that's what keeps anybody going in this business.''

<HEAD>Most People Choose Doctors Old-Fashioned Way, Poll Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most people still choose their doctors by relying
mainly on advice from friends or family rather than fee
considerations, despite growing worry over medical costs, a poll
has found.
   But one watcher of the health-care market suggested the figures
mask the large number of patients who automatically put fee
considerations first by belonging to managed health-care plans that
limit physician choices.
   And the head of a health-consumer group said more people might
make decisions based on fees if fee information were easier to get.
   A Gallup poll of 1,500 randomly selected U.S. adults found that
the factor they most often cited as their main reason for choosing
a doctor was the recommendation of friends or family. That reason
was offered by 19 percent.
   Referrals by professionals were close behind at 17 percent,
followed by specific medical reasons at 13 percent and convenience
at 9 percent, according to the survey, commissioned by the American
Medical Association.
   Only 1 percent of those surveyed cited fees as the main factor
in their most recent selection of a physician, said an article in
the May 25 issue of the AMA's weekly American Medical News.
   But 20 percent of respondents said cost was at least part of the
picture when they chose a doctor. That compares with 60 percent who
said they believe cost is the main problem facing U.S. health care
and medicine today.
   ``The results show that although the public is concerned with
the big-picture concept of medical costs, patients care far more
about how a physician treated their neighbor or their cousin than
which physician has the cheapest fees,'' said Dr. James S. Todd,
acting AMA executive vice president.
   But other specialists offered different interpretations,
including Roger Holstein, president of Consumer Health Services
Inc., which operates a physician-referral service called Prologue
in eight cities.
   He said 32 percent of people choosing physicians already belong
to cost-saving managed-care plans, such as health maintenance
organizations or preferred provider organizations, that restrict
their choice of physicians, so ``the process of choosing a doctor
has much more to do with convenience.''
   An additional 27 percent of people looking for doctors are
limited to physicians who can offer payment plans or will accept
their insurance, Holstein said from Boulder, Colo.
   ``There is evidence that 59 percent are choosing a doctor
largely on the basis of payment plans,'' said Holstein, quoting
figures from a study his company did this year.
   Arthur Levin, director of the Center for Medical Consumers, a
non-profit medical information service with 15,000 subscribers,
said he believes few doctors will release fee schedules over the
telephone.
   ``There's no way to compare unless you go around to 10 doctors
and make appointments'' and ask for prices of varying services
during the course of an examination, he said from New York.
   ``That's kind of an inefficient and expensive way to find out
what the price is,'' he said.
   The Gallup poll, conducted in January and February, found that
concern about doctors fees is growing. The proportion of
respondents who agreed to the statement ``doctors fees are usually
reasonable'' fell from 33 percent in 1988 to 25 percent in 1990,
said the poll, which had an error margin of 2.5 percentage points.

<HEAD>Lab Began With Nuclear Power Reserarch, but Now Helps Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early research at the Argonne National
Laboratory helped create nuclear power, but now scientists there
are turning crop waste into plastic, unlocking the secrets of
photosynthesis and preparing to study soil with a powerful new
X-ray.
   The laboratory's basic mission of energy research has produced
spinoffs that could help farmers produce food and find new markets.
   ``Advances in agriculture are most likely to occur as a result
of the application of modern science, and that's precisely what
we're attempting to do,'' lab Director Alan Schriesheim said.
   Argonne, which opened in 1946 with a mission of finding peaceful
uses for atomic energy, has 1,700 acres 25 miles southwest of
Chicago. Rare white deer roam the grounds.
   Part of the U.S. Department of Energy, it is operated under
contract by the University of Chicago. The staff of 3,000 includes
more than 1,000 scientists, engineers and technicians.
   Argonne spokesman David Baurac said much of the research focuses
on energy sources.
   For example, polymer chemist Patrick Bonsignore has been
converting potato scraps and cheese whey into degradable plastics.
   ``We want useful products from waste, and we are optimistic
about their use in agriculture,'' said Bonsignore. ``But the
current technology needs to be upgraded significantly so we can
lower the costs.''
   He said the degradable plastic material could be used to mulch
farm fields and coat pesticides to give them a timed-release effect.
   Argonne also is preparing to build a $700 million Advanced
Photon Source _ billed as the world's brightest X-ray _ to begin
working in 1995 or 1996.
   Agronomist Darrell Schulze of Purdue University said it will
give researchers a powerful tool to examine soils _ how they shrink
and swell, how minerals are arranged within them, and how plant
roots behave.
   ``We should be able to see things in their natural state without
cutting them or digging them out,'' said Schulze. ``One thing this
might be useful for is understanding drought tolerance in plants.''
   Biochemist Deborah Hanson is using photosynthetic bacteria to
study photosynthesis, and believes her work could make crops more
efficient and increase their yields, and lead to the design of
herbicide-resistant plants.

<HEAD>Cookie Man Changes His Way of Eating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who made a living on chewy cookies that
were almost as much chocolate chip as dough now is preaching weight
loss. For him, the conversion was essential. His life depended on
it.
   In a witty and honest book, David Liederman offers practical
advice to people who share his addiction: compulsive eating.
``David's Delicious Weight-Loss Program'' (St. Martin's Press,
$18.95) is not a medical book, nor is it a magic bullet. But it is
inspiring.
   The ``cookie man,'' at 5-foot-11, weighed more than 300 pounds
and had dangerously high cholesterol and blood sugar levels when
his doctor let him know: ``I wouldn't live to see my children grow
up.''
   That did it. Liederman changed his life.
   He calls himself a compulsive eater in remission. And happily
so. ``My sense of humor had disappeared when my eating was out of
control _ I was angry at myself and it spilled over onto the people
around me. I was sneaky, too, as all compulsive eaters are when
they try to keep their binges a secret. Now I'm neither.''
   Liederman opened David's Cookies, shops that sell fresh warm
cookies, and owns two New York City restaurants. This is his third
book. Written with Joan Schwartz, it includes exactly how to keep a
food journal, sample menus, a guide to eating in restaurants, and
recipes for such dishes as wild mushroom soup, roasted chicken
salad, white clam pizza, potato pie, and oat bran cookies.
   Liederman, who says he was overweight since childhood, had more
going against him than most dieters _ surrounded every day by the
``the world's finest chocolate, butter, pastries, ice cream and
cookies.''
   But while he once tasted everything, he now depends on the
aroma, or on tastings by his wife, Susan, and two daughters.
   ``Sure, I would prefer the old way, but a compulsive person
can't afford preferences. If you are a compulsive eater you are
eating yourself to death _ death by overweight or death by
cholesterol or a combination of both.''
   His effort included avoiding foods that would increase his
cholesterol; eating good, well-prepared food; learning what foods
triggered his binges and avoiding them; keeping a food journal; and
exercising. Like many specialists, Liederman says a ``diet'' is not
the answer, and his own litany of diet failures is plenty of
evidence they didn't work for him.
   ``You have to take responsibility for your own eating habits and
change your own behavior,'' he writes. ``You need a program that
makes sense for you as an addictive personality.''
   Trained as a French chef, Liederman said his diet recipes meet
standards he demanded at the three-star Restaurant Troisgros in
Roanne, France.
   Liederman's stories, or versions of them, will sound familiar to
compulsive eaters. One night at the dinner table Liederman, his
brother and his stepfather _ forks first _ surged toward the one
remaining pork chop. The stepfather speared the brother, and in the
chaos, Liederman got the meat.
   ``We ate fast and we talked fast; at the dinner table we went
for speed and volume. We were so eager to get to the next portion
that we barely tasted what we were eating and whatever hit the
table was devoured as if hit by a buzz saw.''
   He also tells of eating frozen pastries, standing at the open
freezer door. Later, vacations revolved around getting to the most
three-star restaurants in France in the shortest amount of time.
   ``The name of the game was overkill. I would start lunch at 12
and finished somewhere between 4 and 5 p.m., having polished off
seven courses of food, two bottles of wine, 10 desserts and Cognac
or Armagnac.''
   Despite the humor in his stories, Liederman takes overeating
seriously, recognizing the excuses, denial and self-pity and
fighting over and over against his addiction.
   Not all compulsive eaters are overweight, he notes. And many
hide their bouts of overeating, if not from everyone, from some
people.
   ``A compulsive eater doesn't eat fast and overeat because he or
she enjoys food,'' he said. ``The idea is to control the food, to
make it all belong to him or her.''

<HEAD>Not All Victims of Alzheimer's Are Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tragedy of Alzheimer's disease
comes early to some victims, who find their reason and memories
slipping away in middle age.
   Of the 4.5 million Alzheimer's patients in the United States, 5
percent to 10 percent are younger than 65, said the national
Alzheimer's Association.
   ``We're not talking about a public health problem, as these
cases are extremely uncommon. But it is always very distressing to
see a dementing disorder occur in the prime of life,'' said Ranjan
Duara, medical director of the Wien Center for Alzheimer's Disease
at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach.
   In Broward County, a 38-year-old woman was recently diagnosed
with Alzheimer's. One of the youngest cases in the country, she had
to quit her job as a school teacher last year and lives with her
mother. Disability checks have been slow in arriving, and the
family recently applied for food stamps.
   These young Alzheimer's patients often find themselves shut out
of day care programs and experimental drug trials that will admit
only those 60 and older.
   ``We're recognizing that these people have special needs because
they don't fit into the age categories typically associated with
Alzheimer's patients,'' said Mollie Charters, president of the
Broward County chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.
   About one-third of people age 85 or older will develop
Alzheimer's, said Creighton Phelps of the Chicago-based Alzheimer's
Association. By comparison, less than 1 percent of the population
younger than 55 is at risk.
   Nearly all early-onset patients have a family history of the
disease. They also can exhibit defects in the chromosone that
causes Down's syndrome, specialists say. Many Down's patients also
develop Alzheimer's disease in their 40s.
   Steven Sevush, a neurologist and psychiatrist at the University
of Miami Medical School, said that because a definite diagnosis of
Alzheimer's only can be made by cutting into the brain,
``aggressive attempts should be made to find other causes rather
than making a clinical guess.''
   Some other diseases that occur in middle age have symptoms
similar to Alzheimer's and some of them are treatable.

<DATELINE>BETHEL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battery maker is enclosing tester strips
with its batteries that give a thermometer-like reading on how much
juice they have left.
   Duracell U.S.A. says it has patented the Copper Top Tester
strip, which is squeezed to the top and bottom of the battery. A
liquid crystal bar creeps up to either ``replace'' or ``good.''
   The tester can be used for alkaline batteries and can be used
over and over on standard AA-size, AAA-size, C and D batteries,
said a spokesman for Duracell. It also can be used on other brands
of batteries.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Patients Skip Medications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients with high blood pressure who
skip their medication are pushing up health care costs each year in
the United States, a university researcher says.
   The research quantified the relationship between hospital
admissions for high blood pressure and failure to take medications.
The study was published recently in the journal ``Medical Care.''
   Researchers studied Medicaid patients in Los Angeles County,
comparing those who were hospitalized for high blood pressure
during the year of the study and those who were not.
   On average, those who were rehospitalized did not take their
medicine 46 days over the year. Those not rehospitalized skipped
their medication 25 days.
   Studies of other chronic diseases, such as epilepsy and
glaucoma, show similar trends, said Lee Strandberg of Oregon State
University, one author of the study.
   Nationally, the cost to the health care system of patients who
fail to follow directions for taking medicine is $7 billion to $10
billion, Strandberg said.
   ``Studies such as ours will help target the cause of the
problem. Then we can develop strategies to manage the situation,''
he said.
   The issue is of particular importance in Oregon, where a panel
is developing a priority list for rationing health care for the
poor, Strandberg said.
   The study was done with researchers at the University of
Southern California School of Medicine, University of
California-Berkeley School of Public Health, Los Angeles County and
a private consulting firm.

   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge fell in April for the second time in three months, a sign
analysts said portends continued sluggish growth with pockets of
weakness in construction and manufacturing.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators, designed to forecast economic activity six to
nine months in advance, fell 0.2 percent in April _ due in large
measure to the third straight monthly drop in building permits.

Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. steel industry's recovery from a severe
downturn in the early 1980s could be harmed by clean-air controls
under consideration by Congress, executives of major steel
companies said at their annual convention.
   Reining in proposed pollution regulation has become a major
policy issue for the industry, said Thomas C. Graham, president of
USS, the steelmaking division of USX Corp.
   Other issues of concern include the high cost of capital in the
United States and foreign competition, executives said Wednesday at
the American Iron and Steel Institute gathering.
   ``Clearly, the environment is again the major public policy
issue facing steel producers after a decade in which trade was at
center stage,'' said Graham, who called some clean-air proposals
being considered by Congress ``draconian.''
   He said the steel industry is willing to spend more to install
pollution-control equipment, but only if the results justify the
costs.
   ``We oppose requirements which would drain our available capital
_ and which would cause plant closings and substantial job losses _
without verifiable scientific indication of real benefit to the
environment or improvement to public health,'' he told industry
executives and reporters.
   Graham, who heads the nation's largest steelmaker, said steel
producers spent $7 billion over the last three decades to eliminate
90 percent to 95 percent of the pollutants they put into the air
and water.
   The industry's main concern in the current debate is provisions
of the Senate clean-air bill that would force automatic shutdowns
of plants that produce coke _ a key ingredient in steelmaking _
unless they meet certain pollution standards, Graham said.
   He called a provision that would give steel companies up to 30
years to comply with the coke oven standards misleading.
   ``The fact is that the mere passage of the shutdown provisions
would have an immediate, chilling impact,'' he said. ``How could we
justify making the major investments needed in the next five to 10
years to rebuild aging (coke) batteries ... if they face mandatory
shutdown in the future?
   ``Foreign steelmakers _ who are not facing the kind of
environmental cost burdens we are _ would love to see passage of
the Senate shutdown provisions,'' Graham said.
   The executives said research continues into direct steelmaking _
in which iron ore would be melted directly, eliminating the need
for coke _ but that the technology was at least 10 years away.
   The chairman of the trade association, Frank W. Luerssen, called
the cost of capital the domestic steel industry's top concern.
   Without access to lower-cost borrowing, U.S. steel companies
cannot compete with foreign makers in modernizing plants, said
Luerssen, who is chairman and chief executive officer of Inland
Steel Industries Inc.
   He said companies in Western Europe and Japan can borrow money
at lower interest rates, a major factor in the decision by many
U.S. steel companies to enter joint ventures with foreign companies
and in foreign purchases of U.S. steel plants.
   ``The profitability of steel companies is occasionally too low
to attract low-cost capital,'' said Joseph F. Toot Jr., president
of steel products maker Timken Co. ``On the other hand,
profitability can be substantially improved through investment in
world-leading technology.''
   Commenting on Japanese investment in U.S. steelmaking in recent
years, he said, ``It is intriguing to observe that the Japanese
investor can apparently see through this Catch-22 and see that in
the long haul, the American steel industry will become more
profitable.''
   On another topic, industry leaders said they support the Bush
administration's efforts to eliminate dumping of foreign steel in
the United States and subsidies from foreign governments to their
steelmakers.
   The current limits on steel imports are scheduled to expire in
March 1992. By then, the administration hopes to have eliminated
subsidies and dumping, or selling foreign steel in the United
States at below the cost of production.
   Graham said the industry would seek no further protection or
extension of the import limits if dumping and subsidies were
eliminated.
   He also said the industry believes the main reason it wasn't
competitive globally several years ago was a ``grossly overvalued''
dollar, rather than just unfair foreign competition. A stronger
dollar makes U.S. exports more costly in terms of foreign
currencies.
   He said the Federal Reserve's move to ease inflation in the
early 1980s by raising interest rates, thus increasing the value of
the dollar, ``helped almost destroy American manufacturing
competitiveness.''

<HEAD>New Delaware Law Allows Banks To Sell And Underwrite Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Delaware law that allows banks with
operations in the state to sell and underwrite insurance nationwide
was only hours old when the insurance industry challenged it.
   Gov. Michael N. Castle signed the legislation into law Wednesday
and it took effect immediately.
   Two hours later, a petition was filed with the Federal Reserve
Board to block Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, from
taking advantage of the law. Citicorp plans to locate an insurance
headquarters in Dover and sell insurance nationwide through a
subsidiary of its Delaware bank.
   The petition, filed by five national insurance agent
associations and three local groups, alleges Citicorp is attempting
to evade the federal Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibits bank
holding companies and their subsidiaries from selling insurance,
said William R. Anderson, associate general counsel of the National
Association of Life Underwriters in Washington.
   Citicorp officials, who had not seen the petition, were expected
to respond today, said David Swayze, a Wilmington attorney and
Citicorp lobbyist.
   The law is a continuation of Delaware's effort to stay in the
forefront of an ever-changing financial services industry.
   In 1981, the state enacted the Financial Center Development Act,
which offered tax incentives and eliminated interest rate ceilings
to lure out-of-state banks to move their credit card operations to
Delaware. Delaware was the first to relax its banking laws and
other states soon followed suit.
   Since 1981, the state enacted about eight laws aimed at making
it more attractive for financial service companies to locate in
Delaware, and Castle said the trend would continue.
   ``We cannot rest on our laurels. It's not just banking, but all
financial services that interest us here in Delaware, and we're
always looking at ways to improve our business environment to be
ahead of the curve, to be ahead of our competitors, to be ahead of
everybody else in the country ...,'' Castle said.
   Secretary of State Michael Harkins said there is a possibility
that with the new law, a major European bank could open a
subsidiary in Delaware. He would not identify the bank. He said,
however, that Delaware wants to bring in foreign banks.
   In addition to banking reforms, Delaware is known worldwide for
its favorable incorporation laws. More than half of the nation's
Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in the state.
   As he signed the bill Wednesday, Castle said it was possible the
new law would be challenged by insurance companies or other states.
But he predicted such challenges would fail.
   The law allows banks chartered in Delaware after 1934 to sell
and underwrite insurance nationwide. Most banks chartered before
1934 already have such powers. Those chartered earlier that do not
have such powers must obtain permission from the state Legislature.
   A companion bill also signed into law restricts the types of
insurance banks can sell within the state, but allows them to sell
a full range of products outside Delaware.
   The banks must locate their insurance headquarters in Delaware
to take advantage of the laws.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's No. 2 bank, also has said it
plans to sell insurance through its office in the state.
   More than half of the states allow banks to engage in some form
of insurance sales, but they limit the sales to within state
boundaries, said Mary-Liz Meany, spokeswoman for the American
Bankers Association in Washington. The banking industry considers
the new law a boon for consumers because it expands the market.
   ``There's been a sense that if the insurance industry allowed
more players in the market, the price will come down,'' Meany said.
   She said the law gives insurance powers to about 40 financial
institutions nationwide that have affiliates in Delaware.

<TEXT>
   A state court has denied Bell of
Pennsylvania the right to install telephone devices that flash the
numbers of incoming callers, saying the feature invades privacy and
violates wiretap laws.
   The 4-1 ruling Wednesday by Commonwealth Court reversed a
November order by the Public Utility Commission allowing Bell to
offer the service.
   Caller ID lets people know who is calling before they pick up
the receiver. The caller's number flashes on a small device
attached to the telephone.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Pennsylvania Coalition
Against Domestic Violence and others sued to block the service.
Some argued it would threaten battered spouses and children by
revealing their location.
   Bell offered blocking devices to domestic-violence shelters and
law enforcement agencies to prevent their numbers from being
revealed to users of Caller ID, and Attorney General Ernie Preate
Jr. contended in court papers that the service did not violate
Pennsylvania's wiretap law.
   But the court disagreed, and said Caller ID is unacceptable even
if offered with a blocking device.
   ``In the framework of a democratic society, the privacy rights
concept is much too fundamental to be compromised or abridged by
permitting Caller ID,'' the court said.
   Bill Harral, Bell vice president of external affairs, said the
company mahy appeal.
   ``Because of this decision, Pennsylvanians are being denied a
service they eagerly want and badly need _ a weapon against
unwanted, harassing, threatening or obscene calls,'' he said.
   The service could be vital to emergency dispatchers, allowing
them to locate people who call for help even if the caller hangs
up, Rabe said.
   Bell spokesman Eric Rabe said about 1,000 people had registered
for the service. The company had proposed charging $6.50 per month.
   Caller identification is offered in parts of New Jersey,
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, according to Bell Atlantic,
the corporate parent of Bell of Pennsylvania. They are under review
in Delaware and the District of Columbia.

   A tape deck that has aroused the ire of record
companies because it can make near-perfect recordings of compact
discs has been approved for sale by the government and will soon be
introduced to the U.S. market.
   Despite its expense _ about $1,200 _ the digital audio tape
recorder's ability to make direct digital copies of CDs is expected
to boost sales for the much-debated recording medium, industry
officials said.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry's approval
Wednesday was timed to allow Japanese manufacturers to introduce
DAT recorders at the Consumer Electronics Show, which opens
Saturday in Chicago, the officials said.
   Opposition to DAT technology has persisted in the United States
in the music industry over concern about copyright protection, and
Congress has not yet passed legislation setting a new standard for
the machines.
   Japanese electronics companies, which make virtually all DAT
equipment, have refrained from actively selling DAT decks in the
United States because of opposition from record companies and
songwriters.
   But Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. spokesman Akira Nagano
said his company, which makes Panasonic equipment, might begin
marketing in the United States before legislation is approved if
congressional action is delayed. Current laws do not prohibit DATs.
   One version of the DAT recorder has been sold in Japan and some
parts of Europe since 1987, and are available through the ``gray
market'' in the United States. But in a concession to record
companies, the equipment currently on the market cannot make direct
digital recordings of CDs.
   Instead, they convert the high-quality digital signals on CDs to
analog signals and reconvert them to digital form before recording
them, resulting in a slight loss in sound quality.
   That, combined with the high price of blank DAT tapes that cost
almost as much as CDs, has held DAT sales far below initial
expectations.
   Last summer, however, U.S., European and Japanese record and
electronics industry groups agreed on an international standard
that would allow sales of DAT equipment that can make direct
digital copies of CDs.
   But they also agreed the machines would include a ``sequential
copy management system'' that adds a ``flag'' signal to the tape
when CDs are recorded, to prevent the DAT copy from being copied
further.
   That version of the DAT recorder was approved by the Japanese
government on Wednesday.
   ``After studying the situation carefully, the Japanese
government has decided that the standard agreed upon represents the
best balance between the interests of equipment makers and record
producers,'' Hisato Nagao, a ministry official, told The Associated
Press.
   Unlike analog recordings, digital tape recordings deteriorate
very little from generation to generation. Record manufacturers had
feared that DAT machines would result in a flood of high-quality
copies of CDs that would cut into their sales.
   Company officials said they were unsure until Wednesday's
decision whether they would be able to announce prices and
marketing plans for their DAT recorders at the Chicago show, the
main trade exhibition for the lucrative U.S. consumer electronics
industry.
   ``If the ministry hadn't decided now, it would have meant a
many-month delay in marketing the new DAT equipment,'' said an
official at a major electronics company, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. electronics companies, which have virtually abandoned
production of consumer electronic goods, are unlikely to oppose DAT
marketing, officials say.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Accuses Car Rental Companies of Ripping Off
Consumers</HEAD>

   Car rental companies are coercing consumers
into buying damage coverage they don't need, a consumer group
claims.
   ``It's just a way for (rental companies) to make a lot of
profit. The product itself is inherently a fraud on consumers,''
Lucinda Sikes, a staff attorney for the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, said at a news conference Wednesday.
   But Jan Armstrong, executive director of the National Car Rental
Association, said only about one in five auto renters opts for the
so-called collision damage waiver, which pays for a vandalized,
wrecked or stolen car.
   Sikes said the collision damage waivers can run as high as $13 a
day in addition to the actual rental price.
   ``A lot of people don't need it at all but are buying it out of
fear,'' Sikes said, adding that the cost of the coverage is too
high, sometime boosting the rental price by as much as 48 percent.
   ``It really should be only a few dollars a day,'' she added.
   The U.S. PIRG report said collision damage waivers often are
``sold under coercive circumstances, at excessive prices and with
deceptive statements about coverage.'' The report did not describe
the type of coercion it said was used.
   The report was compiled from a survey of 10 companies operating
in the Washington area.
   Consumers often are left in the dark about exceptions to the
waivers, which may be voided for reasons ranging from travel on a
gravel road to driving after only one drink, Sikes said.
   ``It's written in the fine print,'' she said.
   About 60 percent of personal auto policies cover rental cars,
Sikes said, and some credit card companies provide collision damage
waivers when rentals are charged to the card.
   Armstrong contended Sikes was unfair in suggesting that the
industry was cheating consumers ``when we're in business to provide
a service.''
   Armstrong said customers are not being coerced into accepting
the coverage. Most of those who do pay for the waiver, she added,
either don't own cars, are from other countries or do not have
credit cards or personal auto insurance that provide the coverage.
   ``It's a safety net,'' she said.
   Armstrong said industry leader Hertz favors doing away with the
waiver, but the alternative generally has been higher prices for
all rental cars.
   ``The price is built in and everybody pays,'' she said.
   Both Sikes and Armstrong said people planning to rent cars
should find out first if their personal auto policies or credit
cards would pay for a damaged rental car.

   American agricultural exports for the fiscal
year ending in September will total $40 billion, an increase of
$1.5 billion from the February estimate, the Agriculture Department
forecasts.
   USDA on Wednesday issued a statement revising the estimated
volume of agricultural exports to 150 million metric tons, a
increase of 1.5 million from the February forecast.
   The department said, however, that much of the increase would
result from a change in the system under which shipments between
the United States and Canada are reported, the department said in
its situation and outlook summary.
   The change was designed to eliminate under-reporting of exports
by both countries, USDA said.
   In addition, though, USDA said that since February the prospects
for exports of U.S. corn, soybeans and cotton have improved in
terms of both volume and price.
   USDA also raised the forecast for U.S. agricultural imports from
$21.5 billion to $22 billion.
   It said the main reason was an upswing in fruit and vegetable
imports from Latin America in the wake of December's freeze in
Florida and Texas.
   The department forecast the U.S. agricultural surplus for the
year at $18 billion, only a shade below that for fiscal 1989.
   The surplus had been rising steadily since fiscal 1986 when it
skidded to an anemic $5.4 billion. In terms of volume, the estimate
of $150 million tons is up from last year's total of $146.4 million.
   The forecast puts exports of grains and feeds at $16.3 billion,
wheat and flour at $5.1 billion, rice at $800 million, coarse
grains overall at $7.9 billion and corn at $6.9 billion.
   It estimates total exports of oilseeds and their products at
$5.9 billion, with soybeans at $3.7 billion, soybean cake and meal
$900 million and soybean oil at $400 million.
   The forecast was for livestock products of $5.5 billion, poultry
and products $800 million, dairy products $400 million,
horticultural products $5 billion, tobacco $1.3 billion, cotton and
linters $2.9 billion, seeds $600 million and sugar and tropical
products $1.4 billion.

   USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service is
proposing to lower from 25 percent to 22 percent the limit on fat
in ground beef under its institutional meat purchase specifications
used by schools, hospitals and the armed services.
   The change would be part of a broader revision of the
institutional meat specifications, the department announced. It
said the move was designed to reflect increased consumer interest
in lower-fat beef.
   ``Its a step in the right direction,'' said Bonnie Liebman,
director of nutrition for the Washington-based Center for Science
in the Public Interest. ``They could do more.''
   Currently, USDA defines lean beef as having no more than 10
percent fat by weight but makes an exception for ground beef and
puts its level at 22.5 percent. ``That's why I like to speak of
so-called lean ground beef,'' Liebman said. Regular ground beef can
range up to 30 percent fat by weight.
   Under the institutional purchase specifications, the limit
applies only if the buyer does not negotiate to obtain the beef at
a different level of fat.

   USDA is cosponsoring a National Sustainable
Agriculture and Natural Resources Conference on Aug. 15-18 in
Lincoln, Neb.
   Sustainable agriculture refers to growing techniques that reduce
reliance on pesticides and other chemicals that have been shown to
pose health risks.
   ``The conference is designed to achieve a profitable agriculture
that is environmentally sound, resource efficient, socially
acceptable and thus sustainable in the future,'' said Charles E.
Hess, assistant secretary of agriculture for science and education.
   The conference will bring together educators, government
officials, farmers, agribusiness executives and environmentalists,
USDA said. It said they would ``develop guidelines to form state
teams to implement programs for sustainable agriculture throughout
the nation.''
   Other sponsors include the Rodale Institute, Dupont Co., the
American Forestry Association and the Wildlife Management Institute.

Subsidies</HEAD>

   A four-year effort to revamp the world trading
system remained in doubt after U.S. and European negotiators failed
to budge from their positions on government payments to farmers.
   No headway in resolving the stubborn dispute was reported
Wednesday after lengthy discussions by key trade officials of the
United States and the European Community.
   ``We have hit a snag,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills.
   Mrs. Hills and other American officials tried to use a meeting
of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development to advance the Uruguay Round of trade talks. But their
efforts were blunted by the community, made up of a dozen West
European nations.
   ``This is not a negotiating forum,'' said Frans Andriessen, the
community's trading chief.
   The Americans want the Europeans to agree to do more to slash
their costly subsidies to farmers, but the Europeans so far have
refused.
   The dispute has stalled the Uruguay Round negotiations, an
ambitious effort to overhaul the world trading system by reducing
trade barriers in 15 areas, including agriculture and textiles.
   The bargaining among nearly 100 nations began in Uruguay in 1986
and is scheduled to end with a final round of talks in December.
   But the latest failure to find common ground on farm subsidies
does not bode well. The talks are held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and an agreement
for promoting freer trade.
   Canada's international trade minister, John Crosbie, was glum
when he came out of Wednesday's discussions.
   ``It was discouraging,'' he said. Both sides, he said, ``seemed
to be so adamant of their own positions.''
   Andriessen acknowledged that the inability of the community to
change its position might be viewed negatively. But he predicted
the trading partners would be able to ``come to a satisfactory
agreement.''
   Mrs. Hills said the negotiators would be in ``grave difficulty''
if they were unable to settle the farm subsidy dispute by December.
The United States has linked agreement on the agriculture issue to
success in other areas as well. But Andriessen noted that
``agriculture is not the only issue,'' since the talks cover 14
other areas.
   American officials wanted Thursday's final statement at the OECD
meeting to show that both sides were willing to lower trade
barriers so that farm exports would have better access to other
countries' local markets.
   They also wanted the community to promise to reduce farm
payments that encourage overproduction of crops and to slash
subsidies that help farmers sell their goods on foreign markets.
The United States complains that export subsidies have helped the
community increase its share of the world market.
   The community refused to pledge to widen its markets to foreign
food products or to curb export subsidies, according to U.S.
officials.
   The community has argued that it has adopted a plan limiting the
maximum annual amount of expenditure on price guarantees. But it
says it cannot wipe out its subsidy programs entirely.
   OECD members are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and West Germany.

   Share prices were broadly lower at midday Thursday
in what some dealers described as a natural reaction to the sharp
gains of recent days.
   ``We've gained about 80 points in the past couple of days, so a
fall of up to 20 points is probably healthy,'' one trader said.
   Other dealers pointed to surprisingly weak trading in stock
futures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 9.9

   Volume came to 308.1 million shares at midday, compared with

<HEAD>Honeywell, Northwest Reach Accord To Navigate Via Soviet
Satellites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative deal reached by Northwest
Airlines, Honeywell Inc., and the Soviet Union could relieve
overseas air routes and make ground-based navigation equipment
obsolete, officials from the two companies say.
   ``It will allow us to put more airplanes in the sky more
safely,'' Bob Buley, manager of flight standards and product
development for Northwest, said Wednesday.
   ``We think it could be the sole source of navigation by 1995,''
said Jim Koch, vice president of Minneapolis operations for
Honeywell.
   The joint venture allows for the simultaneous testing of Soviet
and U.S. satellites as a navigation guide for commercial jets. It
was announced at a news conference by Honeywell Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer James Renier and Northwest Chairman Alfred
Checchi.
   The executives said the agreement signed by Honeywell, Northwest
and the Soviet Union is subject to government approval in both
countries.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets would deliver equipment to
Honeywell and Northwest late this year. The exchange would enable
Honeywell to build units capable of reading commercial aviation
signals from the Soviet Glosnass satellite system. Military
aviation signals would not be accessible, Koch said.
   The equipment would be mounted on a Northwest 747 cargo plane
for test flying through September 1991. The same plane in April
began testing Honeywell equipment that reads commercial navigation
signals from the U.S. Global Positioning System of satellites.
   The 21 active satellites planned for each system could enable
pilots to double-check the positions of their planes to guard
against inaccurate readings, Buley said. The system also could
enable planes to land at airports that lack sophisticated
ground-based navigation equipment, he said.
   ``It will literally open up the globe to commercial aviation,''
Buley said.
   Koch said Northwest and Honeywell will strive to have the dual
satellite navigation system certified for use in all commercial
jetliners by 1993. They will seek certification for the system as a
plane's sole source of navigation by 1995.
   Trans-oceanic air travel would benefit the most by the advance,
Buley said. The absence of ground-based navigation during overseas
flights requires pilots to approximate their whereabouts and keep
about a 60-mile buffer between planes, he said.
   Satellite navigation would allow pilots to nearly pinpoint their
whereabouts and fly within five or even three miles of other
planes, he said. Today's reference systems for flying overseas can
result in position errors of about 10 nautical miles for every five
hours of flying, Honeywell said in a news release.
   ``We're running into gridlock over there now,'' Buley said of
routes from the United States to the Pacific Rim, where Northwest
is dominant. ``We're having to take delays getting off the ground
because we have to wait for the planes ahead of us to get well into
the system.''
   The agreement would not give Honeywell exclusive rights to
develop equipment capable of reading Soviet satellite signals, but
it would give the controls maker a head start on a potentially huge
market, Koch said.
   Koch said the Soviets alone have up to 4,000 commercial
airplanes. Excluding the Soviet Union, the worldwide fleet of
commercial aircraft is estimated at about 9,100, said Tom Cole, a
spokesman for the aircraft maker Boeing Co. of Seattle.
   Buley said it could cost between $25,000 and $50,000 to equip
each plane with equipment needed to receive satellite signals. The
sales would be made by Honeywell's space and aviation division,
which accounted for about $2 billion of the company's $6.1 billion
in sales last year.
   Checchi said Northwest would eventually like to extend its
routes to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But he said such an
expansion ``is not our highest priority.''

   Kemper Corp. says it will lay off 600 employees
and restructure its unprofitable stock brockerage operations in an
effort to save about $30 million a year.
   As a result of the restructuring, the suburban Long Grove,
Ill.-based company said Wednesday it would take a $126.5 million
charge against second-quarter earnings.
   The changes are due to be completed by year's end and will
affect about 12 percent of the brokerage's U.S. work force of
5,100, the company said.
   The plan calls for the company's five regional brokerage firms,
which had functioned largely independently, to operate as divisions
of a management unit, Kemper Securities Group Holdings Inc.
   The five firms are Blunt, Ellis &amp; Loewi in Milwaukee; Boettcher
&amp; Co. in Denver; Lovett Underwood Neuhaus &amp; Webb in Houston;
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in Cleveland and Kemper Clearing Corp. in
New York.
   The five firms will keep their own names but administrative and
support activities will be based in Illinois.
   ``By operating as completely autonomously as we were, we found
ourselves int he position of duplicating many activities,'' said
James Boris, chairman of the Kemper Securities Group.

<HEAD>Polish Officials Predict Stock Trading Soon in Warsaw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not happen right away, but two Polish
officials say their country is ready for that hallmark of
capitalism, a stock market _ even after more than 40 years of
Communist rule.
   ``If all will be well, we will be able to do it, I think, in the
late fall, say October, November 1990,'' Grzegorz Jedrzejczak told
reporters Wednesdasy.
   He and Leslaw A. Paga, both advisers to Poland's Finance
Ministry, are drafting that country's first securities regulations
since the 1930s. They met with reporters in the offices of SEC
Chairman Richard C. Breeden.
   ``We expect that in early fall we'll be ready with drafts of
securities law which we will present to our Parliament, and of
course, nobody knows how long it will take in Parliament because
that's an advantage of democracy,'' Jedrzejczak chuckled.
   The visitors said securities trading could resume in Poland
quickly if legislation creating a Polish securities and exchange
commission is passed.
   But the pair conceded it won't be easy to win foreign investment.
   ``We cannot declare that we just now are a trustworthy
country,'' said Paga. But they said there would be no problem
finding capitalists in Poland.
   Noting the thriving black market in foreign currency in
Communist-dominated Poland, Jedrzejczak said ``people are quite
smart. It won't be a problem. There are hundreds of people trading
commodities on the streets now.''
   Meanwhile, Breeden announced the appointment of top officials
from the New York Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
and other industry professionals to an advisory panel on emerging
markets in Eastern Europe.
   In addition to outgoing Chicago Merc Chairman Leo Melamed and
NYSE Chairman John Phelan, who will be stepping down at the end of
the year, the panel includes:
   Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, a self-regulating organization that oversees
the over-the-counter stock market; and Matthew P. Fink, senior vice
president and general counsel of the Investment Company Institute,
a mutal fund and investment company trade oranization.
   Also: Shaun F. O'Malley, chairman of the accounting firm, Price
Waterhouse and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman William A. Schreyer.
   The panel, which expects to hold its first meeting in mid-June,
will recommend what action the SEC and the financial industry can
take to help create and organize securities markets in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   It was the third visit to the SEC for Paga and Jedrzejczak, who
said they hoped to create a securities regulating agency ``in the
Polish tradition'' and not just a carbon copy of the SEC.
   They have been studying not only U.S. markets but those in
Canada, Spain, Italy, France and other countries because ``we need
to follow ... the international standard,'' said Paga.
   He said the pre-war Warsaw stock exchange was comparable to
other stock markets in the 1930s, but necessary regulatory
legislation was all but demolished ``during the Stalinist period.''
   Jedrzejczak said new growth in Polish securities trading would
rely on the speed of privatization which, in turn, would ``depend
on political decisions, at least partly. But we expect within two
years from now there will be about 100 companies which will be
traded on the stock exchange.''

<HEAD>France's LVMH Moves to Increase Guinness Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a French liquor
and luxury products group, on Thursday moved to increase its stake
in Guinness PLC to 24 percent, in line with the British liquor
company's stake in LVMH.
   LVMH said it didn't intend to increase its holding beyond that
level, and that the move was part of an agreement reached with
Guinness in 1988 to hold equal stakes in each other.
   Guinness said it welcomed the move.
   LVMH makes Moet champagne, Hennessy cognac, Louis Vuitton
luggage and perfumes. Guinness, a brewer, also makes Johnnie Walker
Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin. The companies have said the
cross-holdings underscore their commercial cooperation.
   LVMH said it was lifting its Guinness stake to 24 percent by
offering to buy 6.8 percent of Guinness through a tender offer.
LVMH was offering to pay as much as $13.86 a share for up to 59.4
million Guinness shares.
   LVMH's current holdings include 42.8 million shares which the
company acquired Thursday. These purchases plus the tender offer
will cost a total of about $1.4 billion, LVMH said.
   Guinness shares stood at $12.80 on London's Stock Exchange
Thursday morning, up from $12.47 at Wednesday's close.
   Guinness gradually acquired its 24 percent stake in the French
group over the past two years.
   LVMH's statement that it doesn't intend to raise it fairly compatible
companies,'' Davidson said.
   Last year Guinness had after-tax profit of $793 million on sales
of $5.2 billion. LVMH said its profit and sales figures were not
immediately available.

<TEXT>
   Feuding family owners of two designer blue
jeans companies settled a multimillion-dollar dispute, but hours
later a row developed among the lawyers.
   A lawyer for Guess? Inc., which settled a legal battle with
Jordache as jurors were deliberating Wednesday, jeopardized the
deal by seeking a $17.7 million lien on the settlement, another
Guess lawyer contended.
   Marshall Grossman, who represented Guess during the trial, filed
the notice for a lien to make sure he would get his salary bonus,
said Pierce O'Donnell, who represented Guess in the settlement
negotiations.
   ``It's a very treacherous act to have a lawyer turn on his
client,'' said O'Donnell, who described the Guess clients as
``outraged.''
   A lien is a claim on another person's property as security for
the payment of a debt.
   Grossman would not comment on whether a lien notice had been
filed, citing attorney-client confidentiality. But he asserted:
``The settlement is in no jeopardy whatsoever.''
   The family feud involved four French-born Marciano brothers,
Maurice, Armand, Paul and Georges, who founded Guess in 1981, and
three Israeli-born Nakash brothers, Joe, Ralph and Avi, who own
Jordache and purchased a half-interest in Guess in 1983.
   The partnership disintegrated in allegations of fraud and
double-dealing, which led to two separate trials to resolve the
claims.
   The Marcianos contended the Nakashes intended to steal for
Jordache the Guess designs that were making a splash in the fashion
world.
   In ensuing years, Guess soared to the top of the lucrative
designer jean market. Over the past four years, Guess profits have
averaged $45 million a year.
   The settlement filed in Los Angeles Superior Court rescinds the
sale of Guess stock by the Marcianos to the Nakashes. The Nakashes
agreed to return the half-interest in Guess, which they bought for
just under $5 million.
   The Marcianos won an earlier court fight in which a jury
determined the Nakashes had defrauded the Marcianos when they
purchased the interest in the then-fledgling company.
   The terms for division of some $106 million held in an escrow
account were not revealed.
   The agreement also included restraining orders forbidding either
Guess or Jordache to spy on the other company through electronic
surveillance, telephone wiretaps or other means.
   O'Donnell said the Nakashes' attorney, Howard Weitzman, was
``shocked and very concerned'' about the lien notice. A call to
Weitzman's office after business hours Wednesday was not answered.
   Before the lien was filed, Weitzman said he had been trying to
settle the case for nearly a year along with about a dozen other
related cases pending in civil and federal courts in Los Angeles,
New York and Hong Kong.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today,
bogging down after another advance Wednesday to a record high.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.14 to 2,876.42
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a slim edge on losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 475 up, 459 down and 539
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.22 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market's steady rise to new highs in recent
days had stirred up considerable enthusiasm for stocks.
   But traders apparently adopted a cautious approach today while
they awaited Friday's report from the Labor Department on
employmentin May.
   The data are expected to be skewed by the temporary effects of
government hiring of census workers. Even after that is factored
out, many observers are uncertain whether the figures will lend any
fresh conviction to recent hopes for lower interest rates.
   Elsewhere, evidence of a weak showing by the economy in April
continued to accumulate. The Commerce Department this morning
reported a 2.3 percent drop in new factory orders.
   Tyco Toys climbed 3{ to 28&lsqb; in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it had received takeover inquiries from a party it
didn't identify.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .05 to 196.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was unchanged at 362.91.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.07 to a
record 2,878.56.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 8 to 7 on the NYSE
with 802 up, 701 down and 508 unchanged.
   Big Board volume reached 199.54 million shares, up from 137.41
million in the previous session.

   France today rejected a European Community demand
to lift a ban on imports of British beef and cattle, saying it
would await a report from veterinarians sent to assess the
so-called ``mad cow'' disease.
   British officials were infuriated when France imposed the
temporary ban Wednesday on the ground that the beef may be tainted
by bovine spongiform encephalitis, a nervous disorder.
   Britain accused France of using the disease as an excuse to
protect its domestic market. France is Britain's biggest market for
beef and cattle.
   ``They ought to lift that ban straightaway,'' said Francis Maud,
British minister of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
   ``British beef is perfectly safe. All the scientific evidence
points in that direction. This French ban is unjustified and
clearly in breach of Community Law, and as good Europeans we find
that intolerable.''
   The disease, which so far has killed 13,648 cows in Britain,
eats holes in the brains of infected cattle, leaving tissue spongy.
The British government says there is no indication the disease can
be transmitted to humans. Nevertheless, beef sales have declined
sharply in Britain.
   The European Community Commission, in a statement today, said it
``regrets ... the action of the French authorities, taken without
prior consultation.''
   ``In the absence of convincing arguments for this action, the
commission calls upon France to revoke the ban immediately,'' the
statement said. It said the EC has taken all necessary health
precautions regarding the disease.
   EC Agricultural Commissioner Ray McSharry, in Paris for the
annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, said there was ``absolutely no
justification'' for France's action.
   Aides to French Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet said the ban
would remain in effect pending the return by this weekend of French
veterinarians sent to Britain to investigate the disease.
   The concern of the ministry, Nallet's office said, is ``to
guarantee the health of French consumers and cattle.''
   The cause of the disease is not known. Because the symptoms are
similar to scrapie, a sheep disease, it is assumed that the disease
was transmitted through cattle feeds which use sheep offal as a
protein supplement.
   The British government has allocated $19 million this year for
research into the disease, which was identified in Britain in 1986.
The outbreak has largely been confined there, although a few cases
have been confirmed in the Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Belzbergs Sell Stake In Armstrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Belzberg family of Canada has
abandoned its bid to acquire Armstrong World Industries, ending a
feud that prompted the enactment of the nation's toughest
anti-takeover law.
   First City Capital Corp., a Belzberg entity, said Wednesday it
had sold its 4.8 million shares in Armstrong, a flooring-products
and furnishings manufacturer with $2.5 billion in annual gross
revenues.
   Armstrong purchased 3.7 million of the shares and its board had
authorized the repurchase of up to 4 million shares, said company
spokesman John Scheldrup. He said the shares were bought at $35.75
per share.
   The move comes about a month after the Belzbergs failed to seat
three of four nominees on the Armstrong board and the state enacted
legislation that requires corporate raiders to surrender short-term
profits from thwarted takeover bids.
   First City spokeswoman Dezanne Philips acknowledged the
stringent takeover law and the largely unsuccessful proxy fight
played a role in the decision.
   The anti-takeover legislation was drafted last year after the
Belzbergs first disclosed an interest in acquiring the company. Its
introduction triggered a nationwide debate between investor groups
and state labor and business interests.
   The Belzbergs mounted an aggressive lobbying effort to defeat
the bill in the Pennsylvania Legislature, claiming it would protect
ineffective management and strip stockholders of traditional
rights. But the bill was approved by wide margins.
   In addition to garnishing profits in failed takeover bids, the
law also restricts the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor
contracts when corporations change hands.

<TEXT>
   With the return of bull-market enthusiasm that
has carried stock prices to new highs in the past few weeks, Wall
Street is setting its sights on a lofty target _ the 3,000 level in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Should the market keep rising the way it has all through May,
analysts point out, that once-distant objective could be reached in
very short order.
   In less than five weeks from April 27 through the close on
Wednesday, the ``Dow'' _ the oldest and best known measure of
trends in stock prices _ surged up 233.51 points, or 8.8 percent.
   From Wednesday's record reading of 2,878.56, it needed only a
4.2 percent advance to reach 3,000. And in today's early trading,
the Dow edged even closer, rising 4.98 to 2,883.54 by 11 a.m.
   As always when the Dow approaches a round-number milestone, many
professional traders and money managers in the financial world are
inclined to downplay its significance.
   For all its renown, the average comprises only a small sampling
of 30 big-name stocks that do not necessarily mirror what is
happening to the shares of hundreds of other substantial companies.
   Still, analysts generally acknowledge that a Dow reading of
3,000 could be widely read as a signal that the bull market of the
1980s had survived a series of scandals, the crash of 1987 and a
recession in the securities business itself to persist into the
1990s.
   ``I think it is a big psychological target,'' said Robert
Stovall, president of Stovall-Twenty-First Advisers Inc.
   A move to 3,000 in the Dow any time soon would come less than 3{
years after the average first broke 2,000, in January 1987. That
kind of advancing pace has few parallels in the history of the
century-old average.
   It first touched 1,000 in 1966, during some of the headiest days
of a ``go-go'' era of enthusiasm for stocks that faltered badly in
the bear markets of 1969-70 and 1973-74.
   It took more than 16 years, until early 1983, for the Dow to
break decisively above 1,000 and start moving steadily higher.
   But as impressive as its recent exploits may look, they have
left a good many veteran analysts unawed. For one thing, these
observers note, a tripling of the Dow since the '60s still leaves
it struggling to keep up with inflation over the same span.
   There is plenty of skepticism as well about the prospective
significance of a 3,000 Dow for the economy as a whole.
   The doubts arise partly from the stock market's penchant during
much of the 1980s, and again more recently, for staging its
strongest advances during periods of sluggish economic growth.
   Whenever business activity has picked up momentum in recent
years, stock prices generally have bogged down amid fears of
increasing inflationary pressures and higher interest rates.
   True to form, the latest market gains have come on evidence of
slackening growth, which has been accompanied by a dropoff in
inflationary expectations and a decline in interest rates.
   As long as stock traders think this way, some analysts contend,
they are in danger of being caught napping should a recession hit.
   S. Jay Levy and David A. Levy, economists in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
argue that the markets reflect ``wishful thinking about a
continuing expansion of the economy.
   ``The weaknesses of the economy that were reported this month
may be the prelude to, or even the beginning of, a recession,'' the
Levys contend. ``The chances of avoiding a downturn this year are
only two in five.''
   But Edward Yardeni, economist at the brokerage firm of
Prudential-Bache Securities, maintains that overall growth can
continue while ``rolling recessions'' run their course in
individual sectors of the economy.
   Stocks also stand to benefit, Yardeni says, from a long-term
downtrend in interest rates and the profit gains American companies
can reap in the changing political worlds of Europe and Asia.
   His forecast for the Dow Jones industrial average: 5,000 by the
end of 1993.

<HEAD>Forecasts of More Rain Push Grains, Soybean Futures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market continues to be weather driven, as the latest
National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast calls for continued
wet conditions in the Midwest, said Victor Lespinasse of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The strength of soybean futures reflects the continued inability
of many Midwestern farmers to plant their crops because of soggy
fields.
   Corn futures opened lower but were staging a comeback largely
due to the same factors that were helping soybeans.
   The weather service's outlook calls for above-normal
precipitation in Illinois and most of the eastern corn producing
region.
   Wheat was getting a boost from concerns the harvest of red
winter wheat could be delayed by wet conditions.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.33\ a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 1} cents lower with July at $1.41{ a bushel; soybeans were
1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with July at $6.07 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Light movement of hogs from the farm to processors was giving a
boost to hog futures, and higher wholesale prices gave a lift to
frozen pork belly futures.
   Cattle prices were pushed lower by expectations of an increase
of fed cattle supplies through the spring and summer.
   Live cattle were .07 cent lower to .13 cent higher with June at
74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with August at 83.75 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with June at 66.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent to .45 cent higher with July at 66.50 cents a
pound.

   Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald's
resignation, announced at a time when the automaker is scaling back
and struggling to regain lost market share, is troubling to the
company and investors alike, analysts say.
   Greenwald, the apparent successor to Chairman Lee Iacocca, said
Wednesday he was resigning to head United Air Lines employees'
$4.38 billion proposal to buy the carrier. He became the third top
Chrysler executive to quit this month.
   Iacocca, 65, whose contract expires at the end of 1991, said
when Greenwald was named vice chairman in November 1988 that the
chairmanship was his to lose. But Greenwald, 54, flew earlier this
week to Iacocca's villa in central Italy to discuss his plans with
his longtime boss, a company spokesman said.
   ``Lee made a major effort to try and change his mind,'' an
unidentified company source told The Detroit News. But Iacocca and
Greenwald returned Wednesday to Detroit to make the announcement.
   ``It has to disturb investors that ... the person who has been
designated as the next chairman of Chrysler would leave Chrysler
just a few days after the Chrysler treasurer announced his
resignation,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, senior vice president at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``Not only will investors be disturbed by the management
succession, they will wonder what these managers know about
Chrysler that we don't know,'' Glantz said.
   Greenwald's resignation, effective immediately, follows those of
Michael Hammes, who was vice president of international operations,
and Chrysler Treasurer and Vice President Fred Zuckerman. Chrysler
also has seen its market share slide and its earnings dive.
   The automaker reported a 80 percent drop in earnings during the
first quarter of this year. It made $71 million during the period,
or 32 cents a share, compared with $351 million, or $1.50 a share
in the first quarter of 1989.
   Its U.S. market share for cars and light trucks fell from 14.1
percent at the end of April 1989 to 12.4 percent at the end of
April 1990, and an austerity program launched last October will
slice $1.5 billion from Chrysler's $426 billion annual budget by
1991.
   Greenwald, vice chairman since November 1988, will become chief
executive officer of the Chicago-based United Employees Acquisition
Corp., an entity formed by the airline's three major unions to
handle the buyout efforts.
   UAL stock was up $4.75 a share to $155.62{ in mid-day trading on
news of Greenwald's move.
   United's pilots union led an ill-fated $6.75 billion plan to
acquire the airline last year. The proposal collapsed after the
union and its partners, which included senior management and
British Airways PLC, were unable to get bank financing for the
deal, sparking a stock market panic.
   After the acquisition, Greenwald, 54, will become chairman and
chief executive officer of UAL Corp. and United Airlines, its chief
subsidiary, the employee group said in a statement.
   Glantz added that Greenwald is putting himself in position to
cash in on the buyout.
   ``He's paid about $1 million a year (at Chrysler) ... but his
Chrysler stock options are worthless,'' Glantz said. ``In a
leveraged buyout that works, you can make tens of millions of
dollars, maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said there has been no decison
on who will replace Greenwald, but Glantz said the logical
successor is Robert S. Miller Jr., 49, now Chrysler's chief
financial officer.
   United Auto Workers union vice president Stan Marshall, who
leads the union's Chrysler department, speculated that Robert A.
Lutz, president of the automaker's Chrysler Motors Corp.
subsidiary, also will have a shot at filling Greenwald's shoes.
   ``He's been the one out there pushing the cars while Greenwald
held back on putting cars on the market,'' Marshall said.
   Harris said the recent resignations were unrelated to each other
or to the company's belt tightening.
   ``This really shows the depth of Chrysler's management,'' Harris
said from the company's Highland Park headquarters. ``There are
some very talented people here. They are sought after.''
   Hammes left May 17 to become an executive vice president for
Black &amp; Decker Corp. and vice president of Black &amp; Decker's power
tool group, Harris said. Zuckerman said he resigned, effective this
summer, to look elsewhere for a position in ``corporate
restructuring or other senior financial officer activities.''
   Greenwald worked with Iacocca at Ford Motor Co. and followed him
to Chrysler in 1979. He played major roles in securing federal
government loans that saved Chrysler from bankruptcy in 1979, and
in negotiating the purchase of American Motors Corp. in 1987.
   ``I can understand Jerry's interest in an opportunity like the
one United Air Lines presents today,'' Iacocca said. ``He is a
major management talent, and he'll have a chance to show it.''
   Greenwald said the difficult part about resigning from Chrysler
will be leaving Iacocca and other Chrysler executives.
   ``Looking back, the most gratifying period for me were those
uncertain years,'' he said. ``I've been offered an opportunity to
lead another great company during a period of major transition, and
it's an opportunity I can't turn down.''

<HEAD>Jury Backs Residents of Ashland Oil Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. was ordered to pay
$10.3 million to four neighbors of its Catlettsburg, Ky., refinery
who said emissions from the plant hurt their health and damaged
their property.
   Residents of Ceredo and Kenova, W.Va., and Catlettsburg, Ky.,
sued in state court after finding a caustic white substance on
their cars and homes. The substance was not easily removed and
damaged their property, they alleged.
   ``The verdict recognizes the magnitude of the problem that
people have been living with for a number of years,'' attorney D.L.
Hamilton said Wednesday. ``I hope Ashland Oil got the message.''
   The exact nature of the caustic substance was not established at
the trial.
   More than 270 Kenova-area residents have suits pending against
Ashland for a total of more than $840 million. Wednesday's verdict
should force Ashland Oil to re-evaluate whether to settle out of
court, Hamilton said.
   ``My answer to that is that we're going to appeal this case,''
said Dan Lacy, an Ashland Oil spokesman.
   The company's appeal to the state Supreme Court will target
Judge Tod Kaufman's decision to block former Environmental
Protection Agency administrator Lee Thomas from testifying, Lacy
said.
   Thomas was to testify about air quality standards, Lacy said.
Kaufman said Thomas' testimony would have been confusing to the
jury and that Thomas was not qualified as a technical expert on air
quality standards.
   The court also refused to allow testimony on the company's air
monitors.
   ``Had we been able to bring that information to the jury, we
honestly believe the jury's verdict would be different,'' Lacy said.
   Ashland Oil attorneys argued residents had no evidence of
illness or property damage, such as medical expenses or repair
bills.
   Ashland Oil, Kentucky's largest corporation, had 1989 revenues
of $8.46 billion.

   The dollar rose against other major currencies in
European trading Thursday, helped by a combination of political
jitters and trading in preparation for Friday's report on the U.S.
labor market.
   The start of the summit between U.S. President George Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Washington set the market
on edge, particularly as a dispute appeared possible over the
future role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the
unification of Germany.
   World tension elsewhere, particularly in the Middle East, also
helped the dollar, traders said.
   A strong undercurrent influencing the trade in dollars, dealers
said, was the expectation in foreign exchange markets that U.S.
employment figures for May would be good.
   Market expectations are for a rise of 253,000 in non-farm
payrolls and no change in the unemployment rate from April's 5.4
percent.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.75 yen, a gain of 1.00 yen
from Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 152.65
yen.
   The pound tumbled Thursday after remarks by Bundesbank President
Carl Otto Poehl, who on Wednesday said the time wasn't right for
British entry into the European Monetary System (EMS).
   Traders said the pound could bounce back as soon as late
Thursday in U.S. trading.
   The British pound traded in London at $1.6760 compared to
$1.6930 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday's levels were:
1.6990 West German marks, up from 1.6810; 1.4325 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4210; 5.7300 French francs, up from 5.6715; 1.9060 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8880; 1,247.00 Italian lire, up from 1,237.25;
and 1.1740 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1778.
   Selected midday rates in New York included: 1.6975 West German
marks; 152.275 Japanese yen; 1.43075 Swiss francs; 1.17325 Canadian
dollars; and 1,247.50 Italian lire.
   A pound was quoted at $1.6795 at midday in New York.
   Gold bullion prices declined. A troy ounce of the precious metal
was quoted at a bid price of $363.75 late Wednesday in London, down
from $366.65 late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the gold bid was $364.00, down from $366.25 late
Wednesday.
   Silver in London was quoted at a bid of $5.08 a troy ounce, down
from Wednesday's $5.15.

   Senior executives from MCA Inc., the U.S.
entertainment giant, conferred Thursday with Premier Michel Rocard
about the proposed construction of a movie-oriented theme park and
studio complex near Paris to compete with Walt Disney Co.'s Euro
Disneyland.
   The MCA delegation, headed by President Sidney J. Sheinberg, is
considering both Paris and London as possible sites for the $1.2
billion project, trying to determine which location offers better
financial opportunities.
   Rocard, according to his office, told the visitors he was
amenable to the proposal provided that MCA addressed environmental
concerns and cooperated fully with the French TV and film industry.
   MCA's final decision is expected within the next few months, and
the complex is tentatively scheduled to be opened in 1993.
   The proposed site in France is Melun-Senart, a new suburb being
developed about 20 miles southeast of Paris.
   The complex would include a golf course, hotels with 5,000 rooms,
a high-tech industrial park oriented toward the audiovisual
industry, production studios and an amusement park.
   MCA, which is based in Universal City, Calif., has projected 5
million visitors to the park in its first year, and estimates the
complex would create 12,000 jobs.
   About 20 miles north of the site, foundations are being laid for
Euro Disneyland, an even bigger project, scheduled for opening in
1992. Disney executives anticipate 11 million visitors in the first
year, and have estimated the total cost of the undertaking at $7.6
billion.
   British officials have been trying to woo MCA with a 1,600-acre
site on the outskirts of London. Their hopes are based in part on
the premise that the company might shy away from direct competition
with Euro Disneyland.
   There is evidence, however, that MCA won't back away. It has
decided to compete head to head with Disney World in Orlando, Fla.,
by opening Universal Studios Florida nearby.
   The Times of London reported recently that several British
officials travelled to Hollywood to lobby on behalf of the London
site.

<TEXT>
   American Home Products Corp. said Thursday its
top health care products executive, Bernard Canavan, has been
elected as its president.
   Canavan, 54, succeeds John R. Stafford as president. Stafford,
52, had been president since 1982 and remains chairman and chief
executive.
   Among American Home's most recognizable brand names are Woolite
detergent and Easy-Off oven cleaner.
   Canavan is a physician who has been with American Home Products
since 1969.
   He was elected to the board in January and put in charge of
nearly all the company's health care operations, American Home said.
   Late last year, American Home bought A.H. Robins Co., which makes
Robitussin cough syrup and Chap Stick lip balm, for $3.2 billion. In
April, American Home agreed to sell its household products business
to Reckitt &amp; Coleman PLC, for $1.25 billion.
   ``It is most appropriate that as the company has become more
concentrated in the areas of Ben Canavan's expertise, that he take
on a greater role in the management of all our operations,''
Stafford said. He added that health care represents more than 85
percent of the company's sales.
   In his new job, Canavan will oversee drug and medical supply and
devices as well as food and household products.
   Stafford will continue to oversee financial and administrative
functions, industrial relations and the general counsel.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as weather concerns continued
to dominate trading activity.
   Corn futures were pushed lower selling by professional traders
and funds, and a National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast
that called for more favorable planting weather.
   Heavy rains in recent weeks have delayed the planting of corn,
and a dry spell could allow farmers to catch up, said William
Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures were higher on conjecture that the amount of corn
acreage given over to soybeans may not be as large as expected,
Biedermann said. Because soybeans mature more quickly than corn,
farmers usually plant soybeans when corn planting is delayed into
June.
   Soybeans also received a boost on speculation that a planned
Brazilian port strike would cause enough shipping delays to shift
export business to the United States.
   Wheat futures opened weak, then surged late in the trading
session on news the Peoples Republic of China had bid for 600,000
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents lower to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.33{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
lower to a { cent higher with July at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were 1

<HEAD>EC Says U.S. Farm Subsidy Demands Are Politically Impossible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American demands that the European Community slash
its export subsidies to farmers would be ``politically impossible''
to meet, a trade bloc official said Thursday.
   But other officials warned that the community's refusal to budge
was threatening the outcome of ambitious plans to overhaul the world
trading system.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the fight over
subsidies that broke out at the annual meeting of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development was ``a disagreement that
was waiting to happen.''
   But, Brady told a breakfast meeting of reporters, it ``is best
that we face the differences in the free world openly and with some
energy now rather than wait until the last minute.''
   At issue is an American demand that the 12-nation European
Community do much more to slash its costly subsidies to farmers,
which the United States claims hinder trade. The Europeans so far
have refused.
   Ray MacSharry, the community's agriculture chief, said the
trading bloc could not eliminate its export subsidy program.
   ``That is politically impossible and will not happen,'' he said.
``We're best to get involved in serious negotiations about making
progress ... for greater liberalization of trade.''
   He said eliminating the subsidies would mean higher farm prices
in Europe and unemployment for millions of farmers. The community
gives exporters help so more expensive European farm products can
compete with lower prices on the world market.
   The deadlock has stalled the Uruguay Round negotiations, a
four-year effort to overhaul the world trading system.
   Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said the
European position was ``simply not a tenable long-term position.''
   ``They will be putting at risk not just agriculture but the whole
round (of trade negotiations) if they stick to a position as tight
as that,'' he said.
   The talks, involving some 100 nations, are designed to reduce
barriers to trade in 15 areas, including agriculture and textiles.
   The bargaining opened in 1986 and is due to end in December. It
is being held under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, a forum and agreement for promoting freer trade.
   Trade and finance officials of 24 industrialized nations ended
the OECD meeting by agreeing ``to take urgent steps to reform
agricultural policy, as regards support and protection, so as to
permit greater liberalization of trade.''
   But their final statement reflected the differences between the
United States and the community over how to do that.
   The statement said some nations wanted the others to pledge to
make changes in the areas of internal support, barriers to market
access and export subsidies. U.S. officials had pressed for that
wording.
   In addition to resisting elimination of export subsidies, the
Common Market has refused the U.S. demands that it open its markets
wider to foreign farm products and cut farm payments that encourage
crop surpluses.
   The EC has urged a more general approach, such as finding a way
to measure a country's trade performance in agriculture and then
work to reduce that level.
   The United States and other countries have insisted the farm
issue is crucial to a successful outcome of the overall trade talks.
   In their final statement, the ministers promised ``to make every
effort to overcome the differences'' by a July 23 negotiating
session in Geneva. By then, the United States wants preliminary
agreements or negotiating texts in all 15 areas under discussion.
   OECD members are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and West Germany.

<HEAD>CNN Bringing Back Movie Theater Newsreels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network is reviving the movie theater
newsreel, but some film experts doubt the cinema CNN will be a hit
among audiences who already have expressed disdain for advertising
on the silver screen.
   CNN is hoping that reviving the newsreel, a relic from cinema's
pre-television golden age, will help promote the round-the-clock
cable TV network that is available to 54.4 million subscribers.
   The two-minute film segments, called ``CNN Reel News,'' make
their debut Friday in a New York theater chain. If successful during
a 90-day trial period, CNN officials say they will expand the
program nationwide.
   ``This is a way to inform and to, most importantly, entertain.
And it's another way of getting CNN's image out,'' said Rick
Salcedo, vice president of news promotion at Turner Broadcasting
System Inc., which owns CNN.
   Ironically, television hastened the demise of movie theater
newsreels. The most famous of them, Fox-Movietone News, ended
production in 1963, when TV's comprehensive news coverage made the
novelty of seeing faraway events on the big screen obsolete.
   ``Television was probably the major factor'' in the demise of
newsreels, said Glenn Smith, who maintains the Fox-Movietone
archives at the University of South Carolina.
   Smith said he is skeptical about whether today's audiences want
or need to see news stories at the movies. ``My personal opinion is,
you better have a very novel approach to it,'' he said.
   CNN's newsreels, which will be shown before feature films and
rotated biweekly, will tend to the lighter side of the news. Salcedo
said he figures audiences have plenty of opportunity to see the big
stories before they get to the theater.
   ``It's got to be something that doesn't have such a short shelf
life,'' Salcedo said. ``It's more of the lighter stuff, more of the
entertaining, informative type of information as opposed to the hard
news.''
   The newsreels include items plucked from CNN's regular
programming as well as stories that never made it to TV. A sample
newsreel shown to a reporter included 30-second segments on elephant
seals, frozen smoke experiments, an electronic movie ticket seller
and oatmeal wrestling.
   The opening and closing credits include vintage black and white
images, which turn into a color picture of a space shuttle. Those
segments, which were still in production Thursday, will prominently
feature the CNN logo, according to Salcedo.
   It borders on advertising, and that could mean trouble. Saying
moviegoers don't like commercials, Walt Disney Studios and Warner
Bros. have banned on-screen ads at theaters showing their films.
   Salcedo said the newsreels would not be shown before Disney
films, but he was unsure about Warner Bros.
   Jack Boozer, an assistant professor of communications at Georgia
State University who specializes in movies, said it's difficult to
predict how audiences will react to the CNN newsreels.
   ``I don't think it will be resented as much as the advertising,
which is just blatant,'' Boozer said. ``I don't think it's a viable
idea unless it is `large picture' type of stories. Straight news,
talking heads won't work.''
   TBS has sunk about $100,000 into producing ``Reel News'' but is
not paying the 11-theater City Cinemas chain in New York to show it
during the trial period, Salcedo said.
   He said TBS will seek a corporate sponsor before going national
with the project.
   Although Turner owns a six-screen movie theater in Atlanta,
Salcedo said it was thought that a more objective appraisal of the
newsreels could be obtained in New York.
   ``You get a much more critical audience up there,'' he said. ``If
they start throwing things at the screen, it might tell us
something.''

   The Agriculture Department has no immediate
plans to expand a Southern California quarantine ordered to combat a
Medfly outbreak, a USDA spokesman said Thursday.
   The Mediterranean fruit fly attacks more than 200 varieties of
fruits and vegetables and citrus is especially vulnerable, with
losses of 25 percent to 50 percent of production likely in cases of
severe infestation.
   ``We feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is
quarantined are adequate at this point to prevent the spread of
Medflies,'' said spokesman Larry Mark.
   He said the decision was made Wednesday after the National Plant
Board Advisory Council, meeting here, recommended no change for at
least 30 days.
   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner last week urged the
department to order the entire state of California under quarantine
to fight the Medfly, one of the world's most destructive pests.
   The worst outbreak was a decade ago in the area south of San
Francisco.
   USDA enlarged the quarantine area May 8 to include parts of Los
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. A Medfly
quarantine also is in effect for part of the Miami Springs-Hialeah
area of south Florida.

   To entice buyers for their one-bedroom Boston condo, Kenneth and
Cheryl Bell are prepared to offer just about anything from low-cost
financing to the (newly renovated) kitchen sink.
   In Culver City, Calif., Bruce Preston is a bit more relaxed. He
expects to sell his three-bedroom stucco colonial about $20,000
below the asking price within a month. But he laments, ``If this was
a year and a half ago, it would have taken a week.''
   The Bells and Preston live on opposite coasts but are coping with
a housing malaise that's sweeping much of the country, a reflection
of higher interest rates, tougher mortgage lenders and troubled
regional economies.
   Experts say it's difficult to generalize about something as
varied and vast as the American real estate market, where one home
sits unsold for months while another might get snapped up quickly.
Nonetheless, a random sampling of sellers nationwide suggests more
sob stories and fewer successes.
   ``There are a great many markets doing well and a significant
number that are pretty flat. Unfortunately, the flat markets are
where most people live,'' said John Tuccillo, chief economist for
the National Association of Realtors, a professional trade group of
property brokers that tracks housing trends.
   Real estate hot spots this year include the Pacific Northwest and
portions of the Midwest and the South, experts say. The cooler
spots, which represent some good buying opportunites, are largely in
the Northeast and Southwest.
   ``I call it democratization,'' said Robert Van Order, chief
economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., a federally
chartered company that buys mortgages. ``The Northeast had it good
for several years. Now it's slowing down. The Midwest and Southwest
are coming back. I think the West will always be good.''
   Even so, the ``good'' markets like California aren't immune to
sluggishness. Preston, a 30-year-old social worker selling his
three-bedroom Culver City house, said he recently lowered the asking
price about 2 percent to $299,000. That would have been unheard of a
year and a half ago. He expects it to sell for around $290,000.
   The biggest losers, though, have been those who bought when
prices were at their peak and are now trying to sell into softened
demand. Some sellers, particularly in the Northeast, have resorted
to desperate gimmicks ranging from higher broker commissions to free
trips to Disney World.
   Others have turned to the auction block, once a forum for
bankrupt farmers and professional business liquidators. Jim Gall,
president of Auction Co. of America in Miami, said he expects
auctions in single-family homes to quadruple this year to around
$100 million.
   The Bells of Boston are good examples of eager sellers. Their
first step was to make the price attractive: $78,000 for the condo
they bought three years ago for $80,000, even though they renovated
the kitchen and bathroom.
   While ads for the condo highlight those improvements, they also
promise ``owner will help,'' a rarity just three years ago when
prices were higher.
   Bell, a 27-year-old laborer, said he and his wife were willing to
aid potential buyers in obtaining financing or even loan the closing
costs. The Bells need more space for a growing family.
   Feeling more pressured is Andres Deleon, a 26-year-old
businessman relocating to Venezuela. Deleon is hoping buyers will be
attracted to the cut-rate price on his two-bedroom condo a few
neighborhoods away from the Bells. He's asking $79,000, about 20
percent below what he paid four years ago.
   Underlying the real estate problem has been high mortgage rates.
They crept toward 11 percent in March after falling into the single
digits earlier this year. Rates on conventional 30-year mortgages
now average between 10.25 percent and 10.5 percent, but some
economists say they could edge up again soon.
   ``The rates are what's killing me,'' said George Mojica, a
64-year-old retired maintenance supervisor, who wants to sell his
Baldwin, N.Y., house and move to Florida. ``Once interest rates go
down, there will probably be more activity.''
   The runup in rates has caused single-family home sales and
housing starts to fall to the lowest levels since the 1982 recession.
   In April, the last month for which data is available, new home
sales fell 1.6 percent, the fifth straight monthly drop, to a nearly
7{-year low, government data show. The National Association of
Realtors said April sales of existing homes fell 2.1 percent.
   Starts for houses and apartments fell 5.8 percent that month, the
third consecutive monthly decline, to the lowest rate since October
1982. For single-family homes alone the decline was 7{ percent.
   Mortgage volume, a barometer of housing industry health, totaled
$390 billion in 1989, 16 percent lower than four years earlier. The
Mortgage Bankers Association of America estimates it will fall to
$380 billion this year.
   A more informative picture of lending emerges in regional looks
at mortgage activity, which reflect the health of the local
economies.
   For instance, Stephen Ashley, president of Silbey Corp. of
Rochester, N.Y., a mortgage lender in the troubled Northeast, said
applications were off between 10 percent and 15 percent in the first
four months of this year.
   By contrast, Ronnie J. Wynn, president of Colonial Mortgage Co.
in Montgomery, Ala., said business is booming, with volume during
the same period up to $85 million from $25 million. Wynn said the
gain reflects the company's decision to move into healthier regions,
such as Atlanta and Houston, and out of depressed areas.
   Many lenders stress that even in areas where the housing market
is sluggish, slightly higher interest rates don't mean they aren't
willing to loan mortgage money.
   ``The residential homebuyer still has plenty of credit
availble,'' Ashley said. ``It's still within the realm of what we
could determine to be affordable.''
   Nonetheless, homebuyers still face more restrictions than they
did a few years ago.
   For example, most banks are asking for higher downpayments,
generally at least 10 percent of the price of a home. They're also
abandoning some gimmicks once used to lure borrowers, such as
``no-doc'' or ``low-doc'' loans, in which they approved some loans
without verifying an applicant's income or employment.
   ``I think we're basically back to basics a little bit more,''
said Ashley.
   In addition, lenders have been monitoring business conditions
more closely, wary of plunging into areas where job layoffs or
cyclical industries such as automaking or defense work could affect
a homeowner's financial health.
   ``Now I think lenders are trying to be more predicting in terms
of where the local economies are going and how the housing markets
are doing,'' said Fred Koons, chairman of Chase Home Mortgage Corp.
in Tampa, Fla. ``They adjust credit to reflect those forecasts.''
   Chase, for instance, is looking at home appraisals more
carefully, Koons said. ``You're reliance on appraisal is high
particularly if markets are not inflationary,'' he said.

   An increasing number of homeowners, frustrated by softness in the
housing market and escalating moving expenses, have been turning to
alternate methods of selling their property.
   Some opt for a discount broker or real estate counselor. Some
choose to handle everything themselves to save commission costs.
Others offer inducements to buyers that range from owner financing
to paid vacations.
   For those do-it-yourself homesellers here are some tips offered
by J.R. Paine, author of the ``The 30 Day Way to Sell Your Home.''
   _Make a checklist of all critical areas of your home, eyeing
areas that need repair.
   _Dress up your home. Avoid giving prospective buyers the
impression you don't like where you live or think the home is less
valuable than your asking price.
   _Have a reliable appraiser assess your home's true value.
   _Select the best time to go on the market. In northern climates,
the most popular season is in the warmer months; in southern areas,
colder weather is best.
   _Get a ``For Sale'' sign.
   _Select a real estate attorney.
   _Select a title company to do your title work.
   _Obtain current interest rates from a local bank.
   _Emphasizes money appeal in advertisements with words like
``economical,'' ``bargain'' or ``value''; or ego appeal, with words
like ``elegant,'' ``graceful'' or ``fashionable.'' Use ``low traffic
street'' instead of ``dirt road,'' and describe a rundown house as a
``handyman's dream.''

   Assets of the nation's 502 money market mutual
funds rose $128.3 million to $381.54 billion in the latest week, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a
$94.7 million increase in fund assets the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21, 1990.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 239 general
purpose funds fell $231.2 million to $129.25 billion, assets of 102
broker-dealer funds increased $481.4 million to $159.62 billion, and
assets of 161 institutional funds declined $121.9 million to $92.68
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was 7.68
percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous week,
said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield held at 7.68 percent, unchanged from the
previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 43
days, down from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.20 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.21 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, rose to 5.06 percent from 5.05 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.96
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 8.16 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.17 percent; 8.18 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.19 percent;
and 8.24 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.20 percent.

   The dollar advanced Thursday against all major
currencies except its Canadian counterpart amid buying ahead of a
key U.S. economic report due Friday.
   Nervousness about various world matters also encouraged currency
dealers to buy dollars.
   Gold prices gained slightly in the United States after weakening
abroad.
   The start of the summit between U.S. President George Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Washington set the market
on edge, particularly because a dispute appeared possible over the
future role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after the
planned German unification.
   Tension elsewhere, including in the Middle East, also helped the
dollar, traders said. Dollar investments are typically favored in
times of uncertainty.
   A strong undercurrent influencing trade in dollars was
speculation in foreign exchange markets that U.S. employment figures
for May could indicate economic health. The monthly report,
scheduled for release Friday, will furnish the first information of
how the economy performed during the month.
   The British pound tumbled Thursday after remarks by West German
Bundesbank President Carl Otto Poehl, who on Wednesday said the time
wasn't right for British entry into the European Monetary System.
   Sterling had been bought aggressively in recent days on the
assumption that Britain soon would relent in its opposition to
joining the exchange rate mechanism in which many European countries
participate.
   The pound traded in London at $1.6760 compared to $1.6930 late
Wednesday. Sterling continued to stumble in U.S. trading. A pound
fetched $1.6780 late in New York, down from $1.6950 Wednesday.
   The dollar's trading day began on a strong note in Tokyo. It
closed in the Japanese capital at 151.75 yen, a gain of 1.00 yen
from Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 152.65
yen. It was quoted at 152.10 yen at the end of New York trading, up
from 151.45 yen late Wednesday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late quotes, included: 1.6965 West German marks, up from 1.6825;
1.4290 Swiss francs, up from 1.42265; 5.724 French francs, up from
5.6735; 1,248.25 Italian lire, up from 1,237.75; and 1.17285
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17675.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late levels were: 1.6990 West German marks, up from 1.6810; 1.4325
Swiss francs, up from 1.4210; 5.7300 French francs, up from 5.6715;
1.9060 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8880; 1,247.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,237.25; and 1.1740 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1778.
   Precious metals prices were mixed.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
June delivery added 20 cents to close at $364.30. But Republic
National Bank quoted a late bid of $363.70 for a troy ounce of gold
bullion, 85 cents lower than Wednesday.
   Gold prices had declined in earlier European dealing. A troy
ounce of the precious metal was quoted at a bid price of $363.75
late Wednesday in London, down from $366.65 late Wednesday. In
Zurich, the gold bid was $364.00, down from $366.25 late Wednesday.
   Silver also had a mixed day. Silver for June delivery rose to
$5.074 a troy ounce on New York's Comex from $5.047 on Wednesday. In
London, silver was quoted at a bid of $5.08 a troy ounce, down from
Wednesday's $5.15.

   Stock prices finished mixed Thursday, flattening
out as traders cashed in some of the gains from the market's recent
upsurge to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 57.64 points Tuesday
and Wednesday, slipped back 1.90 to 2,876.66.
   That still left the average with a 219.90-point gain for May.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
801 up, 682 down and 534 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market's strong showing of late had stirred up
considerable enthusiasm for stocks.
   But traders apparently adopted a cautious approach Thursday while
they awaited Friday's report from the Labor Department on employment
in May.
   The data are expected to be skewed by the temporary effects of
government hiring of census workers. Even after that is factored
out, many observers are uncertain whether the figures will lend any
fresh conviction to recent hopes for lower interest rates.
   Elsewhere, evidence of weakness in the economy in April continued
to accumulate. The Commerce Department this morning reported a 2.3
percent drop in new factory orders.
   Bond prices rose slightly in the credit markets, lowering yields
on long-term Treasuries to the 8.57 percent-8.61 percent range.
   UAL gained 4| to 155{ on word that Gerald Greenwald was leaving
his job as vice chairman of Chrysler Corp. to lead a proposed buyout
of UAL's United Airlines.
   Tonka fell 3 to 7&lsqb; in active trading. Late Wednesday the toy
manufacturer said it expects to post a sizeable second-quarter loss
because of disappointing sales of some of its products.
   Westinghouse Electric rose 1&rsqb; to 36&rsqb;. The company said it plans
to buy back as many as 20 million shares of its stock.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at
42&lsqb;; International Business Machines, down ~ at 120; General Motors,
down | at 48|, and Eastman Kodak, down ~ at 40\.
   Tyco Toys climbed 3&rsqb; to 28 in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it had received takeover inquiries from a party it
didn't identify.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.69 million
shares, against 199.54 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 199.77 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.32 billion, or 0.10
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.19 to 196.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .41 to 422.03, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .37 at 361.23.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .20 to 458.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 363.06, up .15.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Prices Plunge on API Inventory Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices plunged Thursday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange following the release of figures showing a buildup in crude
oil and gasoline stocks.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were mostly higher;
precious metals futures were mixed, and livestock and pork futures
were mostly lower.
   The release of the American Petroleum Institute's inventory
figures Wednesday showed an increase rather than the expected
decrease in gasoline and crude oil stocks.
   The API reported that gasoline inventories as of last Friday
increased 1.1 million barrels from the preceeding week to 214.2
million barrels.
   The nation's inventory of crude oil increased by 2.1 million
barrels and distillates, which includes heating oil, by 737,000
barrels.
   ``The build in crude is particularly ominous,'' said Nauman
Barakat, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
``Crude stocks are at eight-year record highs ... so you've got to
give the benefit of a doubt on prices to the down side.''
   Adding pressure to energy prices were API figures showing an
increase of 492,000 barrels a day in refinery runs. And as
refineries return to operation after seasonal maintenance work,
output is expected to continue climbing.
   Barakat said the consensus in the industry is that demand will be
flat in coming weeks, which will mean prices will continue to fall.
   He also noted that there are rumblings that the Saudi Arabian
government is growing irate with continued overproduction by members
of OPEC. Barakat said the Saudis may eventually overproduce
themselves in retaliation.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 68 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in July at $17.40 a barrel;
heating oil was .45 cent to 1.08 cents lower with June at 50.07
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to 2.98 cents lower
with June at 63.89 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade as weather concerns continued to dominate trading
activity.
   Corn futures were pushed lower as a result of selling by
professional traders and funds, and a National Weather Service
six-to-10-day forecast of more favorable planting weather.
   Heavy rains in recent weeks have delayed the planting of corn,
and a dry spell could allow farmers to catch up, said William
Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean futures were higher on conjecture that the amount of corn
acreage given over to soybeans may not be as large as expected,
Biedermann said. Because soybeans mature more quickly than corn,
farmers usually plant soybeans when corn planting is delayed into
June.
   Soybeans also received a boost on speculation that a planned
Brazilian port strike would cause enough shipping delays to shift
export business to the United States.
   Wheat futures opened weak, then surged late in the trading
session on news the Peoples Republic of China had bid for 600,000
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program.
   Wheat was 4 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $3.33} a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with July at $2.78 a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with July at $1.44{ a
bushel; and soybeans were 1} cents to 3 cents higher with July at
$6.07\ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog futures were pressured by lower cash prices, while pork
bellies were the limit down due to technical trading.
   The weakness in pork futures spilled over into cattle, which
gained some support from active boxed beef sales.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at
74 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with August at 83.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .55 cent
lower to 1.30 cents higher with June at 65.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .45 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 64.05 cents
a pound.
   Precious metals futures were mixed in sluggish trading on the New
York Commodity Exchange.
   Gold was 20 cents to 70 cents lower with June at $364.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.7 cents higher with July at $5.110
a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. scrambled to realign
its top management Thursday and fill gaps created at a critical time
by the resignation of Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald and other
executives.
   Responding to Wednesday's surprise resignation of Greenwald, heir
apparent to Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler named Robert S.
Miller, its executive vice president and chief financial officer, as
vice chairman.
   Greenwald, 54, quit the nation's No. 3 automaker to lead a $4.54
billion employee buyout of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
   Miller, 48, and Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz had been
considered likely successors to Greenwald. Lutz, 58, was given
slightly expanded responsibilities.
   Greenwald's resignation was the latest in a series of top-level
depatures at Chrysler, which is struggling to halt the erosion of
its market share and earnings in the face of a weak U.S. auto market
and stiff competition from foreign automakers.
   Michael Hammes, the company's international operations vice
president, quit to head Black &amp; Decker's tool division. Chrysler
Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman said he would leave the automaker this
summer to pursue other interests.
   Also, 62-year-old Bennett Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler Motors,
has cut his work load.
   Iacocca had said he would leave more of the day-to-day operation
to other executives. But his recent remarks that he may remain as
chairman beyond 1991, combined with the rash of top-level
departures, have increased speculation that he might increase his
role in the company's operations.
   The talent drain on Chrysler's upper level management began after
a similar depletion started late last year when Chrysler adopted a
$1.5 billion cost-cutting program to trim white-collar work force by
about 2,500 people.
   ``The (stock) market probably views this as a further indication
that the operating problems at Chrysler are really severe and
probably increases the potential for Chrysler losing its
independence in the future,'' auto analyst John Kirnan of Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. said Thursday.
   Chrysler finished up 25 cents at $15.62{ on Thursday.
   Chrysler's U.S. market share for cars and light trucks fell to
12.4 percent at the end of April from 14.1 percent a year earlier.
   The automaker's profit dropped by nearly 80 percent in the first
quarter of this year, although analysts said the results would have
been worse if not for a company austerity program.
   ``Chrysler is not in (financial) trouble,'' said Joe Phillippi,
an auto industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
``They've got plenty of cash. Clearly they're struggling with
(sales) volume. Even with modest profitability, we're looking at
cash flows that are still excellent.''
   Greenwald, meeting with reporters Thursday, dismissed suggestions
that Chrysler was a likely takeover target.
   ``I don't put much stock in a major partnership or a major
merger,'' Greenwald said.
   Chrysler has close working relationships with the Japanese
automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and the French automaker Renault.
Italy's Fiat SpA and Chrysler reportedly have been talking about a
sizeable deal.
   Greenwald said Thursday he began thinking seriously about leaving
Chrysler 10 days ago and finally decided to do so Wednesday morning
after spending a day and a half with Iacocca.
   Greenwald, who has been roundly supported by the United Auto
Workers union, repeatedly declined Thursday to say whether he felt
Iacocca would step down then or seek a new contract with the
automaker. Speculation that Iacocca would be active after 1991,
whether he officially retires or not, apparently didn't sit well
with Greenwald, although he denied being frustrated.
   ``I think he (Greenwald) recognizes that Lee is probably going to
be around for an extended period of time,'' Phillippi said.
   ``Even if Lee were to become chairman only and Jerry were to
become CEO, he's still going to have the old boss looking over his
shoulder,'' Phillippi said. ``And that may have bothered him.''
   Greenwald said the challenges of financing the UAL buyout _ which
would be the largest employee buyout of a U.S. company if it
succeeds _ were too good to ignore.
   ``Here I am having a second chance to go through a major
industrial event in American history,'' Greenwald said.
   Greenwald was a major player in Chrysler's winning of loans and
federal loan guarantees to pull the company from the brink of
bankruptcy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

   A Pennsylvania state court ruling barring a phone
company from installing devices that alert customers to the numbers
of incoming calls could provide ammunition to those trying to block
the service elsewhere.
   The Caller ID service has been criticized as an invasion of
privacy by foes but praised by supporters as a way to detect
unwanted calls and speed the jobs of emergency workers.
   Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court ruled Wednesday that Bell of
Pennsylvania may not offer the service, on the grounds that it is an
invasion of privacy and violates state laws on wiretapping and
phone-number tracing.
   Bell of Pennsylvania said it might appeal to the state Supreme
Court.
   Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the decision ``changes the nature of the debate'' over
Caller ID.
   Most groups with concerns about the service, such as the ACLU,
have said they will not oppose it if the phone companies provide a
way for customers to block their numbers from appearing on Caller ID
screens when they place calls.
   But the Pennsylvania court went beyond such concerns in finding
that Caller ID as a concept violates state laws, with or without the
number-blocking devices.
   Ms. Goldman said the ruling, by implication, could mean Caller ID
services are illegal in other states that have similar wiretap and
number-tracing laws.
   She said the ACLU is pressing for Congress to enact federal
legislation regulating Caller ID services. Bills to do so are
pending in the House and Senate.
   Bell of Pennsylvania does not plan to provide blocking devices
for most customers, including those with unlisted numbers. Such
devices only would be provided to domestic violence shelters and law
enforcement agencies.
   The phone company argues that blocking devices would negate the
usefulness of the service by allowing those who abuse the phone
system, such as obscene callers, to elude detection.
   Rochelle Dreyfuss, a law professor at New York University and an
expert on privacy law, said the Pennsylvania decision could be used
to bolster lawsuits in other states seeking to block or modify
Caller ID services.
   ``It's common for lawyers to argue that `this is what other
states have done with this issue,' '' she said.
   Edward Martone, executive director of the ACLU's New Jersey
chapter, said the Pennsylvania decision ``helps us with our
arguments here.''
   The New Jersey ACLU opposed the Caller ID service that has been
offered by New Jersey Bell since late 1988. Both the New Jersey and
Pennsylvania phone companies are part of Philadelphia-based Bell
Atlantic Corp.
   The ACLU has no active case against the state or the phone
company seeking to block the service, but Martone said it was
considering several options to return the issue to public discussion.
   The office of the New Jersey Public Advocate, which represents
consumer interests before state bodies, also opposed Caller ID in
hearings before state regulatory agencies.
   The office said it believed the service was a privacy invasion
and that it could harm hotlines and similar services that offer
anonymous advice, said Robin Portnoi, the assistant deputy public
advocate.
   New Jersey Bell _ which offers no blocking devices to any
customer _ has addressed the concerns of law enforcement agencies
and social service groups such as shelters by offering them outgoing
phone lines only, Ms. Portnoi said.
   Shelters fear battered women would be afraid to call their
spouses if it would lead to alerting the husbands to their location.
   When a person called by a shelter or law enforcement agency tries
to return the call by using the number that flashed on his Caller ID
screen, he either gets a recording saying the number does not accept
incoming calls or is transferred to an answering service, under
several options provided by New Jersey Bell, said spokesman Peter
Ventimiglia.
   However, Ms. Portnoi said, the state public advocate ``has asked
us in light of the Pennsylvania decision to take another look at
caller ID in New Jersey.''
   Concern over privacy issues sparked California lawmakers to ban
the service unless the phone company offers a blocking device. New
York regulators took a similar stance when they approved Caller ID
on a trial basis in the Rochester area.
   Caller ID is already available or is about to be introduced in
other states, including Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee and West
Virginia.

<HEAD>Two Money Measures Fall in Latest Reporting Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended May 21, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,266.1 billion from a revised $3,266.4 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,062.9 billion from a revised $4,063.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $807.1 billion from a revised $803.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.1 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.7 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,267.9 billion, a 4.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $4,066.0 billion, up 2.0 percent, while M1 rose
5.2 percent to an average of $805.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.157 billion,
compared with an increase of $943 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $924 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$327 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $389 million
in the two weeks ended May 23, down from a revised $628 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $305.3 billion in the two-week period ended May 30, down from
$306.0 billion two weeks earlier.

   Energy futures prices slumped Thursday as
traders, anticipating an oversupply of gasoline and crude oil, sold
down their holdings.
   The June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline plunged 2.98
cents to 63.89 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The July contract tumbled 2.00 cents, and subsequent months also
declined.
   Gasoline prices were slammed by an American Petroleum Institute
report late Wednesday that refineries had sharply increased their
output of the fuel, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, the July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, was down 68 cents to $17.40 a
42-gallon barrel. Later months also settled lower.
   Peter Beutel, an analyst with at Elders Futures Inc., said
traders were concerned that Saudi Arabia would raise its crude
output.
   The publication Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday that
Saudi officials were studying oil production by other countries and
would decide whether to increase their own output.
   The Saudis are believed to be angry because their fellow members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are not abiding
by new production limits.
   If the Saudis raise their output, it would worsen the oversupply
of crude and knock prices lower.
   Home heating oil declined in sympathy with other futures prices
Thursday. The June contract for heating oil fell 1.08 cents to 50.07
cents a gallon, and later contract months also dropped.
   Meanwhile, natural gas moved higher. The July contract advanced
to $1.590 per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.585 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Cat Food Sales Too Late To Save Alpo Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five days after taking Alpo Petfoods Inc.
off the market, an official of the parent company visited Alpo
headquarters and ordered top management to move out.
   Ian A. Martin, who heads American operations for Grand
Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain, Alpo's parent, broke the news
Tuesday to Frank Krum, Alpo president and chief executive officer,
and Willard H. Cressman, senior vice president of finance.
   Alpo's 1,500 employees were informed later that day that Krum,
56, was being replaced by Rob Hawthorne, 45, previously president
and chief executive officer of Pillsbury Canada, also part of Grand
Metropolitan.
   Industry analysts Wednesday attributed the move to the expensive
promotional campaign to introduce Alpo's new cat food.
   Krum will serve as a special adviser to Martin on trade and
industry relations. Cressman has elected not to stay with the
company, a Grand Met spokeswoman said.
   Krum, Cressman and Hawthorne were unavailable for comment.
   The 54-year-old pet food company was put up for sale Feb. 8, when
Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard decided it didn't fit into the
conglomerate's plans to focus on its human foods business.
   Alpo spent $70 million in promotions and advertising for the
introduction of its cat food this year, including the use of the
cartoon character Garfield.
   Alpo, the sixth-largest pet-food maker in the United States, now
holds 9 percent of the $1.3 billion canned cat food market and 5
percent of the $1.1 billion dry cat food market, analysts said.
   Alpo, which earned $45 million in 1989 on sales of about $400
million, expects cat food sales to top $100 million in 1990.
   Because of the rapid growth of its cat food sales, Alpo was
pulled off the market May 24. Martin said Grand Met and potential
buyers were ``not able to reach agreement as to the value of Alpo's
recently launched cat food business.''

<TEXT>
   Employees seeking to buy UAL Corp. for $4.54
billion did well in landing Chrysler Corp.'s Gerald Greenwald to
head the effort, but still need a top executive with airline
industry experience, analysts said Thursday.
   Wall Street quickly signaled its approval of Greenwald, who was
instrumental in arranging the federal government's bailout of
Chrysler a decade ago. UAL stock surged $4.75 to $155.62{ a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   But the stock remained well below the $201 a share in cash and
securities offered by the employee-led buyout group, reflecting
skepticism that the latest in the long line of attempts to acquire
UAL, parent of United Airlines, would succeed.
   The employees _ led by the Air Line Pilots Assocation, the
Machinists union and the Association of Flight Attendants _ still
must arrange financing for the deal. That hurdle caused the collapse
of a $300 a share, $6.75 billion offer made last year by a group led
by the pilots union.
   Nevertheless, ``Greenwald is a known entity in bank circles,''
said a New York-based airline analyst who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It will make them (the buyout group) much more
credible.''
   Greenwald, vice chairman of Chrysler since November 1988 and heir
apparent to Chairman Lee Iacocca, said late Wednesday he would
become chief executive officer of United Employees Acquisition
Corp., an entity formed by the airline's pilots, flight attendants
and machinists unions to handle the buyout efforts.
   After a successful acquisition, Greenwald, 54, would become
chairman and chief executive officer of Chicago-based UAL and United
Airlines, replacing Stephen Wolf.
   At a Thursday news conference in Highland Park, Mich., Greenwald
said he began seriously considering joining the buyout effort 10
days ago, about five weeks after the employee group first contacted
him.
   ``The offer kept getting more tempting,'' he said. ``At one
point, I wasn't at all clear who was going to be running the
company. My mind changed from it being a problem to being an
opportunity about 10 days ago.''
   Greenwald said he first needed to arrange the takeover financing.
The UAL board has given the buyout group until Aug. 9 to come up
with the financing for the takeover, with completion of the deal due
about a month later.
   At a press conference in New York later Thursday, Greenwald tried
to reassure potential lenders that the new UAL would be run for
profit and cash flow needed to pay off debt and grow.
   ``The employees are going to be in the position of investor, not
management. This company is going to be run like any other
company,'' he said. Plans for the company provide money to pay off
loans as well as buy more planes to help the airline grow, he said.
   After examining the company, Greenwald said he became convinced
financing will be provided based on UAL's financial health. The
unions, he said, have just begun visiting potential lenders after
waiting to hire a chief executive.
   Greenwald conceded his lack of airline experience is a weakness,
but added that his work putting together the Chrysler financing is a
strength. He said he hoped much of UAL's management would stay if
the buyout is successful and said any replacements would come from
the airline industry.
   If financing is arranged, Greenwald will seek as his second in
command someone from the airline industry.
   ``While he (Greenwald) has a good record on financial matters,
the airline industry is unique,'' said Robert Joedicke, an airline
specialist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Bankers also need the assurances that would come from a chief
operating officer with a strong knowledge of the airline business,
Joedicke said.
   ``They (the banks) don't have the luxury to have someone to come
in (and undergo) on the job training,'' he said. ``The key
requirement is that there is someone there that understands how to
run an airline.''
   Greenwald played major roles in securing federal government loans
that saved Chrysler from bankruptcy in 1979, and in negotiating the
automaker's purchase of American Motors Corp. in 1987.
   A big obstacle to success at UAL is continuing skepticism about
the chances that the buyout will be completed.
   In 1987, UAL stock rose to more than $100 a share on a decision
by the board of directors to sell assets and distribute the proceeds
to shareholders. The October 1987 stock market crash quickly
followed and UAL's stock fell to about $60 a share.
   Last year, a buyout offer from United's pilots and management
sparked wild speculation in the stock, which soared to $294 a share
in September. The deal collapsed a month later, helping to trigger a
one-day free-fall on the New York Stock Exchange and sending UAL's
stock plunging.
   ``There is so much pain in people's minds over the losses
suffered in the past,'' the analyst said. ``Many investors are
staying away.''

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In General Mills-Cholesterol Cereal Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. has agreed to pay $21,000 to
settle complaints by three states over its anti-cholesterol claims
for the now-defunct Benefit cereal, the company said.
   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III and the attorneys
general in Iowa and Wisconsin alleged that an advertisement claiming
that ``Benefit removes cholesterol from your body'' was false and
misleading.
   Golden Valley-based General Mills said Thursday it agreed to pay
each of the three states $7,000. The settlement is not an admission
of wrongdoing, the company said.
   ``The settlement was the fastest and least costly way to resolve
differences over a single newspaper ad for a product that hasn't
been sold for over five months,'' the company said in a statement.
   Humphrey has urged the federal Food and Drug Administration to
ban food health claims unless there is scientific consensus that the
claims are true. He also urged the federal agency to spell out the
exact wording that food manufacturers must use in making any health
claims about their products.

<HEAD>SEC To Explore Easing Rules in Foreign Tender Offers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators voted Thursday to
explore rules changes that could allow U.S. investors to participate
in tender offers by foreign companies.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously to seek
public comment on the appropriateness of permitting selected foreign
tender offers to proceed in this country under foreign rules and
regulations.
   Such an exception to SEC rules is still a long way off but the
commission took the first step toward even considering it.
   Currently, those buying and selling publicly-offered securities
in this country must comply with SEC regulations _ which some
foreign concerns find too expensive or too onerous.
   Consequently, rather than cut in U.S. holders of foreign stocks
on tender offers for their securities, overseas concerns have chosen
to exclude them.
   The SEC will issue what they call a ``concept release,'' seeking
public opinion on the idea of allowing foreign rules to apply where
the U.S. securities holdings involved constitute a relatively small
portion of the securities in the transaction.
   Among the things that have yet to be decided: the definition of a
``relatively small portion.''
