<HEAD>New Drug Effective Against Rare Form of Leukemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single round of treatment with an experimental
new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of
leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well,
says a study published today.
   The new drug was developed at Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., where doctors tested it on patients
with hairy cell leukemia. In almost every case, the medicine erased
all signs of the disease.
   Hairy cell leukemia affects the white blood cells that make
disease-fighting antibodies. Doctors are also testing the drug
against chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
   The Scripps doctors concluded that the medicine, called
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, or 2-CdA, ``may well be the drug of choice
in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia.''
   The study was directed by Dr. Lawrence D. Piro and published in
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   In their study, doctors gave the drug to 12 patients. Of these,
11 have remained completely free of all signs of the disease for
periods up to four years.
   The doctors cautioned that longer follow-up will be necessary
before they can be sure they have actually cured the disease.
   Two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed
in recent years. They are interferon and deoxycoformycin, a drug
that is similar to 2-CdA. However, interferon is less effective,
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects.
   By contrast, the only unwanted effect of 2-CdA was a few days of
fever. Patients experienced no nausea, hair loss, rashes or other
symptoms typical of cancer therapy. Also unlike other treatments,
this one appears to work after a single seven-day course of therapy.
   The Scripps Clinic reached an agreement recently with Johnson &amp;
Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceuticals to produce the drug, which is not
yet approved for routine use.

<HEAD>Study: Poor People More Expensive to Treat Than Affluent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor patients cost hospitals more to treat than
affluent ones, a study today concludes.
   The study, conducted in Massachusetts, found that poor patients
were hospitalized 3 percent to 30 percent longer than better-off
patients, depending on the hospital, and their bills were 1 percent
to 18 percent higher.
   The researchers did not attempt to learn why the poor needed to
stay in the hospital longer.
   Medicare already pays more to hospitals that take care of large
numbers of poor people. The researchers said their work suggests
that all hospitals _ not just those with high numbers _ should get
extra for their poor patients.
   Medicare pays hospitals flat fees for specific illnesses. But it
does not give more money if patients are unusually sick and need
longer stays.
   The doctors, whose findings were published in the New England
Journal of Medicine, based their conclusions on a review of the
cases of 16,908 people admitted to five Massachusetts hospitals in
1987.
   The study was directed by Dr. Arnold M. Epstein of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Celebrates Ben Franklin, 200 Years After His Death</HEAD>

   Leo Lemay thinks he knows what Ben Franklin
would do if he returned to his adopted city and saw the hoopla
surrounding the 200th anniversary of his death.
   ``First of all, he'd have a good time,'' said the University of
Delaware professor of English and an organizer of a scholarly
conference that's one of several events this week marking April 17,
1790.
   It was on that date that the 84-year-old Franklin, weakened by
gout and kidney stones, died, succumbing to a fever and an abscess
in his left lung.
   He knew it was coming. As early as 1786, he wrote, ``Having seen
during a long life a good deal of this world, I feel a growing
curiosity to be acquainted with some other.''
   The outpouring of grief at the April 21 funeral included a
half-mile-long procession watched by throngs that filled streets
and rooftops.
   Come Saturday, a more joyful parade will celebrate his full life.
   ``We don't want anyone standing on the curb watching this parade
_ we want everyone in it,'' said Hobart Cawood, superintendent of
Independence National Historical Park.
   Among the invited participants are those whose lives or
professions were touched by Franklin's legacy. And since he was a
printer, publisher, journalist, builder, folk philosopher, patriot,
inventor, scientist, diplomat and politician _ that's a lot of
lives touched.
   ``We've got many other groups that are associated with
Franklin,'' Cawood said, ``such as the first insurance company ...
which he founded; Pennsylvania Hospital, which he founded; the U.S.
Postal Service, since he was the first postmaster general; the fire
department, which he started _ all of these have units in the
procession.''
   Of course, all Americans have been touched by the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution, in which Franklin had a hand.
   ``Ask someone, `Who do you associate with Philadelphia?' More
than anyone else, even though he's been dead 200 years, people will
say Ben Franklin, throughout the world,'' Cawood said.
   ``We're not celebrating his funeral. But after he died he left
something very important behind _ he left institutions and
organizations and a reputation and so many things that continue
right up to this year.''
   Franklin also bequeathed 1,000 pounds sterling to Pennsylvania
and Philadelphia in trust to provide low-interest loans to ``young
married artificers,'' meaning apprentices starting their own
businesses.
   He made a similar bequest to Massachusetts and Boston, the
hometown he left as a 17-year-old runaway.
   Franklin directed that the fund be dissolved 200 years after his
death and split between city and state. Now comes the question of
what to do with the money, which today is worth about $4.5 million
in Massachusetts and $2 million in Pennsylvania.
   Philadelphia's share, $520,000, will be used to help students in
the trades, crafts and applied sciences, a special commission
announced Tuesday.
   ``Franklin said, `Laborers and handicraftsmen are the wealth and
support of the nation,' and we are hoping that by these grants we
may increase the number of competent handicraftsmen in
Philadelphia,'' said Whitfield Bell, commission chairman.
   As for Pennsylvania's share, the state Senate has passed a bill
that would give the state's $1.5 million to the Franklin Institute,
a Philadelphia museum devoted to science and Franklin. In
Pennsylvania until now, the Franklin fund has been used to make
mortgage loans at below market rates to low- and moderate-income
workers.
   To Lemay, who has written several books on Franklin, ``he is one
of the very greatest geniuses of the 18th century.''
   ``You can be interested in him as a great scientist, probably
the second greatest in the 18th century after Newton, and you can
be interested in him as certainly the greatest writer of colonial
America,'' Lemay said.
   Lemay helped bring together historians and professors from
around the country _ as well as from France, England and Germany _
to discuss the great man at a conference, ``Reappraising Benjamin
Franklin: A Bicentennial Perspective.''
   Among the topics: Eat Not to Dulness, Drink Not to Elevation:
Franklin's Journalistic Writings on Drunkards and Drinking;
Franklin as Crime Reporter; and Benjamin Franklin as Founding
Father of American Humor.
   And of course, the age-old debate: Was Franklin Too French?

<TEXT>
   A teacher strike that has closed hundreds
of schools since Monday entered its fourth day today with
Oklahoma's Senate deadlocked on education spending.
   Organizers said they expected their largest demonstration of the
week at the Capitol today, in part because teachers from Oklahoma
City, the state's second-largest school district, and Lawton, the
third-largest, are joining the strike.
   At least 12,000 teachers, parents and students picketed at the
Capitol on Wednesday. Elsewhere, students staged walkouts at their
open schools.
   Teachers are demanding more pay and higher school spending.
Their 31,000-member union, the Oklahoma Education Association, says
Oklahoma teachers rank 48th in pay among the states, making $22,000
a year, compared with the national average of $29,648.
   ``We've waited long enough,'' was the message on stickers worn
by many of the teachers, referring to an 8-month-old special
session and the failure of the Legislature to enact a $230 million
school reform and tax bill.
   The bill stalled in the Senate last week when 13 of the 14
Republicans present and seven of the Senate's 33 Democrats voted
against a provision to make the bill effective immediately upon
signing by Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   Many of the protesters have focused their lobbying efforts on
the 20 senators who voted against the provision.
   Union president Kyle Dahlem said the walkout continues to gain
momentum. ``It's incredible the broad support from the teachers,
parents and children,'' Dahlem said. ``I'm at a loss for words.''
   The union, which called for a five-day walkout last week, said
at least 125 of Oklahoma's 606 school districts were closed
Wednesday. About 60 percent, or 343,200, of the state's 572,000
students have been affected.
   More than 20,000 of Oklahom's estimated 35,000 teachers have
been off the job at various times, the union said.
   Despite the walkout, leaders of the Democratic majority in the
Senate said nothing had developed in negotiations with Republicans
on a compromise that could lead to enactment of the school bill.
   Republican Sen. Charles Ford said he offered a compromise that
pared the tax increase from about $230 million to $170 million,
deleting the sales tax proposal. The proposal would raise personal
and corporate income taxes.
   Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison, a Democrat, said the
Ford plan drew no support in a caucus of Democrats.
   Education Secretary Sandy Garrett said she thinks the public
wants the school issue settled soon. ``I think the public does not
like strikes but wants the Legislature to act,'' she said.

<HEAD>Timing of Distant Quakes Just Coincidence, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say it's only coincidence that
earthquakes rocked and rolled Asia, Indiana and three parts of
California this week.
   ``You do get the impression these things are related when they
happen over a large area at about the same time,'' said
geophysicist Don Anderson of the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena. ``But when you do the statistics after the fact, a
link between these quakes never holds up.
   ``They do seem to be happening at random.''
   Scientists also dismiss as pure coincidence that Tuesday's
quakes happened exactly six months after the jolt that killed
nearly 70 people in the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17, and that
Wednesday's shakers happened on the anniversary of San Francisco's
catastrophic quake of 1906.
   Most also believe it's only by chance that so many quakes
happened during a two-day period this week.
   ``If you look up history, this kind of coincidence happens many
times,'' said Caltech seismologist Hiroo Kanamori. ``I don't think
it is really statistically significant.''
   But Anderson said it's conceivable the temblors in three regions
of California are linked by a gradual buildup of stress as the
Pacific plate of Earth's crust moves past the North American plate
along the San Andreas and related faults.
   On Tuesday, a quake estimated at 6.2 to 6.4 on the Richter scale
rocked China's northwest border with the Soviet Union. In the Los
Angeles Basin, seismologists recorded a magnitude-4.6 aftershock
and several smaller aftershocks of the magnitude-5.5 Upland quake
of Feb. 28. A temblor of magnitude 2.5 to 3 jostled rural eastern
Indiana.
   On Wednesday, about 75 quakes _ including one measuring 5.4 _
shook Watsonville, a farming community south of San Francisco Bay
that was hard-hit by the Oct. 17 disaster. Scientists called the
quakes aftershocks of the earlier temblor.
   ``We figured it was all over,'' said Robert Holleson, a former
Watsonville resident who was visiting Wednesday. ``But the power's
off, the phone's dead, helicopters are flying all over. It's like
it's starting all over again.''
   Also Wednesday, a major quake measuring 7.5 rocked the Celebes
Sea between Indonesia and the Philippines, and small quakes rattled
Southern California's desert near Indio.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
reports 1,200 to 1,500 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger
worldwide every month, said Pat Jorgenson, U.S. Geological Survey
spokeswoman in Menlo Park.
   ``It's not unusual two or more moderate to large earthquakes
would occur on the same day,'' she said.
   The entire Earth wobbles as it rotates because of tides,
atmospheric pressure, wind friction and changes in the planet's
molten core.
   Most scientists believe such forces are too small in any local
area to cause quakes. But, Anderson said, ``in places where Earth's
crust is very close to the breaking point, they might be just
enough to trigger earthquakes.''
   He also said a long-term buildup of stress on the boundary
between the Pacific and North American plates could cause widely
separated clusters of quakes in California.
   Kanamori countered that no one has documented a widespread
stress buildup in California's crust.

<HEAD>Organization Mails Copies of ``Filthy'' Art Images to Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pornography-fighting Christian group is
blanketing Congress with envelopes it says contain ``filthy''
pictures of homosexual acts from a taxpayer-funded art exhibit.
   Each envelope marked ``extremely offensive material enclosed''
holds explicit photographs and drawings from the ``David
Wojnarowicz, Tongues of Flame'' show mounted with a $15,000 federal
grant.
   The American Family Association hopes a good look at
reproductions of 14 images displayed at the University Galleries at
Illinois State University will convince lawmakers to kill funding
for the National Endowment for the Arts.
   ``We're spending $175 million in this area that benefits
primarily the rich and the perverted,'' the Rev. Donald Wildmon,
founder and director of the Tupelo, Miss.-based association, said
Wednesday.
   But Barry Blinderman, director of the galleries, said the
exhibition's beneficiaries were the 6,000 students and middle-class
residents of Normal, Ill., who turned up.
   ``The show received excellent local coverage and the support of
a supposedly conservative media here,'' he said.
   Wildmon said he resorted to pictures to show congressmen just
how taxpayer money was being spent.
   ``Someone once said that a picture is worth a thousand words,''
Wildmon said. ``That sheet contained 14,000 words. What I sent to
those congressmen is as filthy as anything I've ever seen.''
   Wildmon also objected to a Wojnarowicz collage that included an
image of Christ with a hypodermic needle.
   Blinderman defended the Christ image as purely symbolic.
   ``In no way is the artist trying to say Christ was a heroin
user. It's a poetic image that's placing the redeemer of mankind
with a very contemporary issue,'' Blinderman said. ``Metaphor can
be understood by common taxpayers. Christ himself spoke in parables
so everybody could understand him clearly.''
   Blinderman said the artist's sexual images are presented as if
the viewer is peering through a telescope.
   ``The point of the work is that there is no one kind of
sexuality in our country, and they address the surveillance of what
should be private activity,'' he said.
   Some lawmakers say Wildmon's campaign is having an effect.
   ``We've received 270 to 300 postcards or letters in the last
month as a result of Don Wildmon writing to the constituents,''
said an aide to Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J.
   ``At this point, it's going to be very difficult for us to vote
to fund the NEA,'' said aide Jeff de Korte.
   Although Saxton supported endowment funding last year, he voted
to withhold $45,000 for controversial exhibits of photographs by
the late Robert Mapplethorpe, which included explicit images of
homosexual acts, and by Andres Serrano, which depicted a crucifix
immersed in urine.
   Those works sparked criticism of the endowment, which also
provides seed money for mainstream artistic activities from opera
to dance nationwide.
   Rep. Dean Gallo, another New Jersey Republican, fired off a
letter to endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer on Wednesday
contending the agency showed poor judgment in supporting the
Illinois exhibit.
   ``What is so unfortunate is that these few decisions could put
many worthy local projects ... in jeopardy,'' Gallo wrote.
``Frankly, support for the NEA is fast disintegrating among members
of Congress and our constituencies.''
   Frohnmayer and President Bush have strongly opposed government
censorship of the arts, while saying taxpayers have no place
financing obscenity.
   Wildmon said he also was sending the package of pictures to
editors of daily newspapers nationwide, 1,000 Christian radio
stations, 100 Christian television stations and 3,200 clergymen.
   Asked whether sending potentially obscene materials through mail
might be illegal, Wildmon said he had consulted with the U.S.
Postal Service.
   ``They told us ... that it could leave us open to prosecution.
But they doubted very seriously if there would be any government
agency that would prosecute us. The contradiction is this is
government-funded material.''
   Lawrence Maxwell, manager of the fraud and prohibited mailings
branch of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Washington, said
the courts have jurisdiction in determining what is pornographic.
   Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, a
lobbying group for the arts, pointed out that some of the most
respected art has been shocking, such as a Goya altarpiece
depicting Christ with syphilis.
   ``I think there are many people who are outraged by these pieces
of art,'' she said. ``But for every one of those citizens who are
outraged by the content of the art there is another citizen who is
outraged by the idea that one minister will set the standards for
the rest of the country.''

<TEXT>
   Soon after security forces unleashed the
bloodiest crackdown in Nepal's modern history, Bijay Bahadur yanked
a picture of King Birendra from his paint shop wall and threw it in
the attic.
   The same day, he also took a handful of rice from his meager
lunch and placed it on a rectangular metal plate as part of a
ritual to feed the king and his forefathers.
   His actions highlight a contradiction in Nepal, the world's only
Hindu kingdom. The monarchy is losing power in a groundswell for
democracy but, for many people, the king remains a living god.
   Bahadur said he pulled down the portrait because he was angry
with the king for the April 6 crackdown.
   ``It was a matter of respect, which had vanished,'' he said.
   On that day, security forces fired into a crowd of 200,000
protesters calling for democracy. Witnesses said police killed
about 200 people. The government claimed only 10 died.
   While gunfire was still echoing through the city, garment seller
Nima Churing, his wife and their four children gathered under
Birendra's picture, lit incense sticks, filled seven small glasses
with holy water and bowed their heads.
   Churing, who like Bahadur also lives in the narrow-laned
Chatrapati area of Katmandu, repeated the prayers the next morning
as soldiers with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled the curfew-bound
capital.
   ``We have done these prayers all our lives. Our forefathers did
it throughout their lives. How can we stop it?'' asked Churing.
   The belief that the king is a living god was propagated early in
the 18th century when snakes prevented King Pratap Malla from going
to a temple of the Hindu god, Vishnu.
   Court astrologers explained the incident by saying Pratap was
the reincarnation of Vishnu and the holy snakes did not want the
king to pray to himself.
   The tradition continued after Birendra's ancestor Prithvi
Narayan Shah vanquished the Malla dynasty and set up his kingdom,
encompassing most of present-day Nepal, in 1769.
   Even today, many people, especially in remote villages, believe
that seeing the king can wash away their sins.
   But while a majority of Nepal's 17 million people _ 75 percent
of whom are illiterate _ worship the king as a god, the educated
and urban population is tearing itself away from the belief.
   ``When I worship the king, it is an inadvertent reaction of my
psyche,'' said Bahadur. ``But I certainly do not believe that the
king is a god.''
   It was this educated and urban elite that led the seven weeks of
pro-democracy protests that forced Birendra to lift a 29-year ban
on political parties. This week, the king agreed to accept his
kingdom's first opposition-led government in nearly three decades.
   During the demonstrations, slogans and graffiti were directed
against Birendra and the royal family for the first time.
   Birendra was depicted as a weak leader, dominated by his wife,
Aishwarya.
   ``Birendra hides behind the queen's petticoat,'' was one chant
that was often heard. ``Birendra thief, leave the throne,'' was
another.
   Many intellectuals believe members of the royal family are
involved in antique and gold smuggling. Queen Aishwarya is often
referred to as Nepal's Imelda Marcos, a reference to the wife of
the late Philippine president.
   There has been little effort to prove the accusations because
criticizing the royalty is illegal.
   Despite the discontent, political observers and newly legalized
political parties agree that the monarchy will remain intact and
that the king will most likely become a constitutional monarch.
   ``It will be a long time before the institution of the monarchy
goes away. The Nepalese people are not ready to sever a part of
their lives suddenly,'' said former Foreign Minister Dilli Raj
Regmi.
   Arbinda Shrestha, a bank clerk who took part in pro-democracy
demonstrations, calls Birendra ``a symbol of unity.''
   ``My political feelings may be there, but I still want the king
to stay,'' he said.
   Many others support Birendra and blame his Cabinet ministers for
the crackdown and mass arrests.
   ``The king was OK. Only his government was bad,'' said Shiva
Manda, a film magazine reporter.
   The people's feelings are echoed by the Nepali Congress party,
which is to head an interim government, and its junior partner, the
seven-party United Left Front coalition.
   With the front's taking part in the government, Nepal becomes
the only country in the world where communists have joined hands
with a monarchy.

<HEAD>Medicare Trust Fund Could be Bankrupt Before Turn of Century:
Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soaring health care costs could bankrupt the
Medicare trust fund that pays for hospital care before the turn of
the century, the fund's board of trustees says.
   In its annual report to Congress, the board said ``early
corrective action is essential in order to avoid the need for
later, potentially precipitous changes.''
   The hospital insurance trust fund is financed with payroll
taxes. While currently more than four covered workers support each
beneficiary, that ratio will start slipping early in the next
century. By the middle of the next century there will be just two
covered workers supporting each beneficiary.
   ``Not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the
hospital insurance program inadequate to offset this demographic
change, the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before
the major demographic shift begins to occur,'' said the report,
released Wednesday.
   If economic growth is moderate, the Medicare Hospital Insurance
Trust Fund will run out of money between 2003 and 2005, the board
said.
   Under optimistic economic assumptions, funds would be exhausted
in 2018, but under a pessimistic scenario, the fund could run dry
in 1999, the board said.
   ``These findings underline the urgency of our task in containing
health care costs and spending our health care dollars more
effectively and efficiently,'' Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan said.
   The projected bankruptcy date is a staple of the board's annual
reports. In the early 1980s, it predicted bankruptcy in the 1990s,
but the date slipped back as cuts were made in the Medicare program
and more optimistic forecasts were used later in the decade.
   Medicare's other trust fund, the Supplemental Medical Insurance
Trust Fund, is ``actuarially sound'' _ that is, it should have
enough money to meet its obligations, the board said. But the
trustees said they were concerned about the soaring costs of the
program, which pays Medicare Part B expenses _ physician and
outpatient services.
   ``Growth rates have been so rapid that outlays have nearly
doubled in the last five years,'' the board said.
   About 75 percent of the money in the Supplemental Medical
Insurance Trust Fund comes from general federal revenues and 25
percent comes from premiums paid by beneficiaries.
   The Medicare program provides medical benefits to about 30
million Americans age 65 and older and 3 million disabled
individuals.
   The board also reported that the Social Security trust funds
that support benefits for the elderly, survivors and the disabled
will remain financially sound well into the next century.
   Trustees estimated the next cost-of-living benefit increase for
Social Security recipients would be 4.5 percent. This would be
considered the 1990 increase, though it would not be paid until
beginning in January 1991. The last increase, for 1989, was 4.7
percent, reflected in checks last January.
   The Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance
trust funds will take in more money than they pay out for the next
several decades.
   Those two trust funds are taking in $316 billion and paying out
$254 billion in the current fiscal year. The hospital fund will
take in about $80.3 billion and pay $63.8 billion; the supplemental
fund will take in $46.2 billion and pay $44.4 billion.
   Based on intermediate assumptions, total income to the two
Social Security trust funds over the next 75 years is estimated to
cover about 93.5 percent of the total amount paid out.
   Because the trust funds are projected to remain solvent for the
next 20 to 30 years, the trustees recommended no changes in either
financing or benefits in the Social Security programs.
   The voting members of the Social Security Board of Trustees
include the secretaries of Treasury, Labor and HHS, as well as two
``public'' members, for which nominations are pending.

   A truck driver was stabbed to death by a
truck-stop cashier's relatives for grabbing her buttocks,
authorities said.
   Brady Wilson, 37, of Weatherford, was stabbed numerous times
Tuesday night at the Food and Fuel Truck Stop near the New Mexico
line and died at a hospital, investigators said.
   Authorities said Wilson had grabbed the unidentified cashier as
she walked through a break area next to the truck stop. The woman
ordered him not to do it again, then went to the truck stop manager
and complained, authorities said.
   Sheriff's Lt. Gary Gabbert said either her brother or her
husband's brother overheard her. ``He went and told her husband and
both men came back and confronted the truck driver,'' Gabbert said.
   Gabbert said authorities had not clearly established who had
slain the man. No arrests were immediately made.

   Financier Charles H. Keating Jr. ended eight
days on the witness stand by rejecting a government lawyer's
suggestion that he tried to have every savings and loan regulator
who challenged him removed or fired.
   However, Keating acknowledged Wednesday that he pursued his
complaints about one top official as high as then-White House chief
of staff Donald Regan.
   ``Had I been listened to, this country would be $500 billion
better off,'' Keating told James Murphy, attorney for the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision who is defending the
government's April 1989 seizure of Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association in Irvine, Calif.
   Keating denied a suggestion by Murphy, representing the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, that he regarded
regulators who had confronted him as motivated by animosity and had
tried to have them fired or removed from his case.
   But asked if he had tried to get Edwin Gray fired as chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, predecessor of the thrift office,
Keating replied: ``I spoke with the administration about it. Yes. I
thought he was wrecking the industry.''
   In response to a question by U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin, Keating identified Regan as the administration official
with whom he spoke. He told reporters later he did not believe the
meeting at Regan's office influenced the chief of staff, who he
said had been unhappy with Gray long before.
   Gray has said Regan tried to force him to resign before his term
expired at the end of June 1987.
   The meeting with Regan is only one example of Keating's
political reach. Five senators who accepted political contributions
from him are under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for
meeting with regulators on his behalf in April 1987.
   Earlier Wednesday, Keating testily rejected Murphy's suggestion
that he had used Lincoln in an attempt to entice Saudi Arabian
investors into supporting his Arizona real estate ventures.
   Murphy introduced documents showing that Keating tried in
February and March 1989 to obtain a $3.75 million loan from the
Saudi European Bank on behalf of American Continental Corp.,
Lincoln's parent firm.
   At the same time, Lincoln put up more than $13 million in two
other deals with the Saudis. In one, Lincoln paid $5.76 million to
buy the Saudis' interest in a California real estate development.
In the other, Lincoln provided $7.5 million of an $8 million loan
from the Saudis to a holding company in the Dutch Antilles.
   The contention that Keating used the federally insured deposits
in Lincoln to benefit American Continental, his Phoenix-based
holding company, is a key point in the government's justification
for seizing Lincoln.
   Officials say the S&amp;L's collapse will cost taxpayers an
estimated $2 billion to cover federally insured deposits.
   Keating said he had no knowledge of the deals between Lincoln
and the Saudis and that his own efforts to obtain a loan from the
Saudis were unrelated.
   Wednesday's testimony marked the 25th day of hearings on the
government's motion to dismiss Keating's suit. Sporkin said he
would give the government through Friday to present any rebuttal
witnesses. He eventually could decide to uphold the seizure, find
it invalid or order a full trial of the matter.

<HEAD>Subsidized Projects Said in Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one-third of the 350 subsidized housing
projects held by a prominent Democratic fund-raiser have financial
or physical problems, a top federal housing official says.
   Francis A. Keating, general counsel of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, defended on Wednesday the department's
suspension last January of A. Bruce Rozet from HUD contracts over
concerns about management of a handful of projects with which he
was connected.
   Keating acknowledged to a House subcommittee that HUD took the
action based on evidence involving only a small number of
properties.
   But he said the troubled projects were symptomatic of larger
problems involving Rozet's web of affiliated corporate entities,
and that more than 100 of the properties in his portfolio were
classified as financially or physically troubled.
   ``The overriding concern from HUD's perspective is that because
of abuse of the system, and misuse or misappropriation of federal
government resources, thousands of families are forced to live in
shameful conditions,'' Keating said.
   Rozet has been engaged in a dispute with HUD and Secretary Jack
Kemp, who in January suspended Rozet and his corporations from any
new department contracts.
   HUD acted after alleging that Housing Resources Management, an
affiliate of Rozet's Associated Financial Corp., misused government
and tenant funds at developments in Oklahoma and Washington, D.C.
Rozet is appealing the suspension before an administrative law
judge.
   Rozet, in a telephone interview from California, defended his
companies' handling of housing projects and said Keating's comments
reflected a failure to understand how subsidized housing operates.
   He said that one Washington, D.C., project his firm managed
remains in bad condition a year after it was turned over to HUD. He
said Keating failed to mention that HUD has taken no steps to begin
asbestos removal, a costly procedure that prompted the owners to
give up the project.
   ``They are clearly the slum landlords; they are clearly the ones
who are perpetuating the conditions and imposing them on the
tenants,'' Rozet said. ``... They are doing exactly what they
accused us of doing.''
   Rozet has been a major fund-raiser for prominent Democratic
officials and candidates, including Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
and Jesse Jackson.
   Keating appeared before the House Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs housing subcommittee, where Rozet had attacked HUD in
testimony Feb. 27. Rozet contended then that he tried repeatedly to
improve conditions at problem developments but was denied help by
HUD officials. He said the department's attitude ``verges on the
criminal.''
   Keating called that claim ``a shield intended to deflect blame.''
   ``We believe that when the quality of life of the tenants is at
stake, owners who fail should be removed, not bailed out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Protocol Official Fined for Evading Duty on Furs</HEAD>

   The State Department's deputy chief of
protocol drew a $648 fine for trying to evade duties on two furs
she purchased during an official trip to Argentina, a Customs
Service spokesman says.
   Jennifer Fitzgerald, a longtime friend of President Bush, paid
the fine to Customs for ``misdescribing'' the value of a fur-lined
raincoat and for failing to declare a silver fox cape, spokesman Ed
Kittredge said Wednesday.
   State Department spokesman Margaret Tutwiler said Customs and
the department's inspector general began a joint investigation
following an anonymous phone call to a complaint hot line in
January.
   Fitzgerald had traveled to Argentina as a member of the U.S.
delegation to the inauguration of President Carlos Menem six months
earlier. She was summoned in March, with her coats, to the Customs
Service office in Baltimore.
   Government aircraft used by State Department delegations fly
from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.
   ``One coat was a raincoat that she had listed on her declaration
as valued at $300, but actually it was lined with nutria fur,''
said Kittredge. ``That changes the situation.'' Nutria is similar
to beaver fur.
   Kittredge said Customs officials valued the coat at $1,100 and
fined Fitzgerald $440 for violating the service's fraud statute.
   She also was fined $208 for failing to declare the cape, valued
at $1,300, said Kittredge.
   Duties are not normally collected on furs from Argentina, he
said, but Fitzgerald was penalized because she had reported her
purchases inaccurately.
   Efforts to reach Fitzgerald by telephone for comment were
unsuccessful.
   The case was referred to the U.S. attorney's office in
Baltimore, where prosecutors decided against further action.
``That's routine,'' said Kittredge.
   Fitzgerald, whom Bush appointed to the protocol job, first
worked as an aide to the president in 1970 when he was U.S. envoy
to China. She was on his staff when he served as vice president.
   Syndicated columnists Jack Anderson and Dale Van Atta first
reported the fur fine on Tuesday.

   ``Roots'' author Alex Haley says his
love for his grandparents has inspired him to write a novel set in
Appalachia.
   ``I want to dispel the image people have about this part of the
world,'' Haley said Tuesday, speaking to a community club.
   Haley, whose ``Roots'' traced his family back to Africa, spent
much of his youth with his grandparents in the Tennessee town of
Henning.
   Grandparents tell grandchildren things they won't tell their own
children, said Haley, who now lives in Norris. Stories he heard
from his grandparents made him think of an Appalachian-oriented
story about the relationship between a grandfather and his grandson.
   Haley said he ``writes with a camera in my head'' and sees the
story becoming another TV miniseries.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ban on At-Home Possession of Child Pornography</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is arming law enforcement
officials with a powerful new weapon to wipe out child pornography
and its ``contemptible exploitation of children,'' anti-pornography
groups say.
   The court, in a 6-3 ruling Wednesday, said states may make it a
crime to possess or look at child pornography, even in one's home.
   While the dissenters said the decision tramples on rights of
free expression and privacy, others were jubilant and predicted
states will follow the court's blueprint and enact tough new laws.
   Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America said every state
should ``take advantage of this decision and immediately begin to
crack down on this depraved and contemptible exploitation of
children.''
   ``This decision will help state law enforcement officials
throughout America shut down highly organized private networks of
pedophiles who trade pictures of their victims,'' said Jerry Kirk,
head of the National Coalition Against Pornography. ``It's vital
that we realize that there is no child pornography without there
first being the tragic molestation of a young child.''
   In other rulings, the court:
   _Said federal judges may order local officials to raise property
taxes to pay for the racial desegregation of public schools. While
ruling unanimously in a Kansas City, Mo., case that judges
themselves generally may not impose such tax increases, the court
voted 5-4 to empower judges to tell school officials to do so.
   _Decided, 7-2, that an overnight guest in a private home enjoys
the same privacy protection as the homeowner against unreasonable
police arrests and searches. The decision struck down the murder
conviction of a Minnesota man staying at a home raided by police
without a court warrant.
   In a separate issue involving children, several justices voiced
concern Wednesday that society's desire to protect children could
deny fair trials to people charged with child abuse.
   The court heard arguments in cases from Maryland and Idaho and
is expected to announce rulings in both by July. At issue is
whether defendants in child abuse cases are entitled to at least
one face-to-face confrontation with their young accusers.
   Some states use closed-circuit television or permit experts to
testify for the children.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said a court appearance might well be
``something of an emotional trauma'' for a child but added that
must be weighed against the years in prison faced by a defendant if
convicted.
   In the child pornography ruling, the justices upheld an Ohio law
said to be the toughest of its kind in the nation. Eighteen other
states also have laws against possessing such material.
   The laws are aimed at stamping out so-called kiddie porn by
punishing those who buy the material, not only those who sell it.
   Justice William J. Brennan, leading the court's dissenters, said
the Ohio law is so vague and so sweeping that it might ban the
engravings of nude children ``that adorn our courtroom.''
   ``At bottom, the court today is so disquieted by the possible
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for
simple possession,'' he said.
   Sexually explicit photos of children ``may be distasteful,'' he
said. ``But the Constitution guarantees both (the) right to possess
them privately and (the) right to avoid punishment under an
overbroad law.''
   A more liberal Supreme Court invoked free speech and privacy
rights in 1969 when it barred states from outlawing at-home
possession of obscene materials.
   But the court said Wednesday that such protection applies only
to obscenity depicting adults. At-home possession of sexually
explicit material depicting children is not protected, even if the
material is not obscene, it said.
   The justices in 1982 carved out a major exception to free-speech
rights when they let states outlaw the sale and distribution of
material depicting children in sexual performances or poses _ even
if not obscene.
   The court for more than 30 years has allowed states to outlaw
the sale and distribution of obscene material, ruling in a series
of cases that such material is not constitutionally protected.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court Wednesday, said
Ohio legitimately seeks to ``destroy a market for the exploitative
use of children'' by making possession of child pornography a crime.
   ``Given the importance of the state's interest in protecting the
victims of child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain,''
he said.

<HEAD>Late Filers Could Use Loophole to Avoid Penalty, Investigators Say</HEAD>

   A gaping hole in Internal Revenue Service
procedures could allow millions of taxpayers to claim falsely that
they applied for an automatic extension of time to file their tax
returns, congressional investigators say.
   ``IRS currently has no way of determining whether the extension
was actually requested,'' the General Accounting Office said in a
report to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr.
   The IRS estimates that 6 million couples and individuals who
were unable to meet this week's deadline for filing income-tax
returns submitted a Form 4868 to get an automatic four-month
extension. They were required to submit with the form a check for
estimated taxes owed.
   By filing Form 4868, taxpayers avoid a failure-to-file penalty
that is 5 percent of tax due for each month or part of a month that
a return is late. The maximum penalty is 25 percent.
   In a report on IRS policies for forgiving, or abating,
penalties, the GAO found that the tax agency is not nearly so
forgiving as raw statistics indicate. In fact, it said, 29 percent
of the abatements of the most common penalties in 1988 were
necessary to correct IRS errors in assessments.
   One of the major causes of such errors, the report said, was
that in many cases, the IRS had no record of taxpayers' application
for a delayed filing deadline, ``although many of them later
produced a copy of the application that they purportedly submitted
on time.''
   Because the IRS has no way of determining whether such a
taxpayer actually filed for an extension, the GAO said, ``as a
matter of policy it records these as assessment errors.''
   In such cases, the failure-to-file penalty could be wiped out.
   Such an adjustment is one of only several types of
computer-generated changes to taxpayer accounts that the IRS
records as penalty abatements. In another example, the agency could
penalize a taxpayer for late payment, then discover a credit on the
taxpayer's account that would prompt a reduction in penalty.
   ``These adjustments may overstate the number of abatements by
almost 80 percent and their dollar value by almost 40 percent,''
the GAO said.
   The study concentrated on the two most common penalties imposed
by the IRS. The penalty for failure to pay taxes on time was
imposed on 8.4 million taxpayers in 1988; the penalty for failure
to file a return was imposed 2.9 million times that year.
   The IRS reported it forgave 2.5 million of those 11.3 million
penalties, or 22 percent. However, the GAO found that 80 percent of
the abatements actually were computer adjustments worth about $954
million.
   ``The remaining 500,000 abatements, worth about $1 billion, were
taxpayer-requested abatements which required IRS personnel to make
a decision regarding whether to reverse, or `forgive' the penalty
assessment, on the basis of information supplied by taxpayers,''
the report said.
   It said the IRS agreed with its recommendation that the
computer-generated adjustments not be reported as abatements.
   ``IRS errors in making penalty assessment and abatement
decisions can increase taxpayer frustration and generate an
additional administrative burden for IRS,'' the GAO said. ``This is
of particular concern in today's environment of growing taxpayer
dissatisfaction and limited IRS resources.''
   The IRS also agreed with a GAO recommendation that tax auditors
be required to fully document reasons for forgiving penalties. GAO
inspectors found that in many cases, justifications for abatements
were inadequate to help in finding and correcting problems in
processing returns.

<HEAD>Spy Toy Lets Little Brother Act Like `Big Brother'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Little brother can play Big Brother with a toy
long-range microphone, complains a children's advocacy group that
says the toy encourages illegal eavesdropping by children.
   But the manufacturer of the ``Spy Tech'' Long-Range Microphone
says there's only a ``remote possibility'' the toy could be used
for eavesdropping.
   ``We've developed a toy line that is totally nonviolent ... it's
safe, it's fun and nonviolent,'' said Jim Alley, senior vice
president for marketing at Tyco Industries, Inc., the nation's
fifth-largest toymaker.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said Wednesday the group would ask the Federal Communications
Commission to investigate the toy.
   ``We want them to investigate the legality of selling a
listening device to children,'' said Charren.
   ACT said it also would ask the Federal Trade Commission to
review print and broadcast advertisements for the microphone.
   Tyco's ``Spy-Tech'' toy line includes the microphone, an
undercover vest, binoculars, an intruder alert, periscope,
fingerprint kit, walkie talkies and a hidden camera. The toys, each
sold separately, are designed for children 8 years and older.
   ``Part of it is just a pretend spy kit,'' said Charren,
explaining the group doesn't object to the complete line. ``The
problem is that the listening device works. It is not then a toy;
it is an eavesdropping device.''
   Such criticism is ``amazing,'' Alley said. The television
commercial for the toy ``does not depict children using any of the
Spy Tech toys in any antisocial behavior,'' he said.
   The advertisement shows two children using the microphone to
hone in on the sound of a man's whistling, but Charren warned it
could be used for other listening.
   ``That message of listening to somebody when he doesn't know
you're listening is one anybody can get from the advertisement,''
she said.
   The company is ``providing the means and encouragement to young
children to surreptitiously spy on their unsuspecting playmates,
friends, families and neighbors,'' said Rudolph Brewington, a
privacy advocate and Washington-based freelance journalist, in an
April 10 letter to Tyco president Richard Grey.
   Brewington contends the device violates both U.S. criminal law
and postal regulations that prohibit the manufacture, distribution
or mailing of devices that are ``primarily useful for the purpose
of the surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications.''
   Alley said there is little chance the microphone, which sells
for under $20, could be used for eavesdropping.
   ``It's a toy. It's not a high-tech listening device,'' he said,
noting ``it works only in line of sight'' and not through walls,
windows or doors. He also said it could not be concealed because of
its size and bright red coloring.
   ``The device is small enough to be hidden in a book bag,''
countered Charren, saying ``it could be used in a schoolroom to
hear another child being disciplined.''
   An aide to Rep. Ronald Dellums said the device would be illegal
under a bill proposed by the California Democrat.
   ``If a child was listening in on three of its playmates across
the playground that would be illegal,'' said George Withers,
legislative director for the congressman's Capitol Hill office.
   The proposal, the Privacy Assurance Act of 1989, would require
that all participants in a conversation consent to its interception
by listening or recording devices in instances not involved in law
enforcement.
   The bill, which has been referred to the House Judiciary
subcommittee on crime, would also require that sound- or
voice-activated recorders emit an audible beep-tone to alert a
speaker that his communication is being recorded.

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-Mexican border has become a zone of
violence because of rock-throwing Mexican bandits who prey on
countrymen trying to enter the United States illegally, a former
U.S. Border Patrol agent says.
   James R. Dorcy, who also worked for the Justice Department's
inspector general's office, on Wednesday defended the patrol
against allegations of human rights abuses.
   He told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights
and international organizations that some people wanted to believe
that the Border Patrol ``has institutionalized unlawful violence
and deprivation'' against aliens.
   ``I come here to tell you that it is not true,'' he said. Any
lapses, he said, are investigated thoroughly.
   But the American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker
humanitarian organization, released a report in which it said it
documented 380 cases of alleged human rights violations against
aliens between May 1988 and May 1989.
   They occurred near San Diego; Rio Grande, Texas; Tucson, Ariz.;
El Paso, Texas, and Florida.
   The violations involved physical abuse, denial of constitutional
rights, arrest, shooting, seizure of property and verbal abuse,
said Maria Jimenez, director of the committee's Immigration Law
Enforcement Monitoring Project.
   ``Particularly alarming is the increasing use of deadly force in
border policing which, in at least one instance in each of the four
southern border areas, have led to death or serious injury,'' she
said.
   Agents have used guns and cars to run down aliens trying to
flee, she said.
   In one case, Luis Eduardo Hernandez, 14, was run over and killed
by a Border Patrol vehicle just a few feet from the border as he
attempted to run back into Mexico through the fence in August 1989,
said Roberto Martinez, who works with Jimenez.
   But Dorcy said the agents are the ones at risk.
   ``The rock-throwing incidents that our Border Patrol agents
daily face are perpetuated by none other than members of the
criminal element at the border who also prey on their own
countrymen trying to cross the border illegally,'' he said.
   Steven Garcia, who represents the Border Patrol agents'
bargaining unit, said the patrol is understaffed and often harassed
by those desperate to cross the border.
   ``Hostile crowds of people hurl rocks, bottles and insults at
border patrol agents who venture close to the border,'' he said.
   Moreover, he said, the Border Patrol is understaffed and unable
to handle the thousands of people who want to get into the United
States. A single agent may handle as many as 40 people at one time,
he said.
   Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., said the situation is deteriorating.
   ``I wish I could say that violent confrontations between
Americans and undocumented immigrants are isolated, but,
unfortunately, they are not,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analysis Sees Wheat Harvest Up Sharply if Trends Hold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new economic analysis by the Agriculture
Department says this year's wheat harvest could increase sharply if
current prospects hold up.
   The wheat inventory on March 1 was the smallest in 15 years and
could be down to 442 million bushels by the start of the new
marketing year June 1, according to USDA estimates. That would be
the smallest June 1 wheat reserve since 1975.
   Analysts said Wednesday that despite the tight supply situation,
1990 wheat prices through mid-March dropped about 10 percent,
reflecting prospects for a larger harvest this year.
   ``Winter wheat acreage seeded last fall was up nearly 4 percent
from a year earlier, and 71 percent of the crop was reported in
good or excellent condition as of mid-April,'' the report said.
   Farmers who normally plant spring wheat indicated in a survey
announced by USDA on March 30 that they intend to reduce their
acreage this year.
   As a result, the new report said, the total wheat acreage may be
up only 1.2 percent from last year.
   ``But some of last year's wheat area was counted twice because
farmers reseeded damaged winter wheat acreage with spring wheat,''
the report said. ``Thus, this year's area increase is understated.''
   Additionally, the report said, winter wheat states say that
``this season's winterkill has been lower, so harvested area may
post larger gains than planted area.''
   The larger harvested acreage, assuming per-acre yields recover,
points to a 1990 U.S. wheat crop ``substantially larger'' than last
year's 2.04 billion bushels. Production dropped to about 1.8
billion bushels in 1988, largely reflecting drought losses.
   Wheat market prices in the 1989-90 marketing year that soon will
end are forecast by USDA to average in the range of $3.70 to $3.75
per bushel, compared with $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.

   A government index that measures drought
severity over the long haul shows that much of the Midwest and
Great Plains has recovered from the moisture deficits of the late
1980s.
   The so-called Palmer Index used by the National Weather Service
shows huge areas of moist conditions east of the Rocky Mountains
and relatively small areas of severe and extreme drought remaining
in North Dakota and adjacent parts of South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa
and Nebraska, and the southern part of Florida.
   Most of the West, however, is still gripped by severe and
extreme long-term drought.
   According to the agency, the index ``depicts prolonged abnormal
dryness or wetness'' over periods of months and years. The index
changes little from week to week and reflects the long-term runoff,
recharge and deep percolation of moisture into the subsoil.
   The index was used in a weekly report by the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility, operated by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments.
   Weather analysts said the overall indications from the index and
state reports are that ``moisture supplies are abundant in the
central and eastern Corn Belt, adequate to short in the western
Corn Belt and mostly short in the spring wheat region.''
   In Ohio and Indiana, for example, topsoil moisture was reported
to be 48 percent and 65 percent in surplus, respectively. The cold,
wet soils have limited fieldwork in Indiana and caused
unhealthy-looking stands of wheat and oats in Ohio.
   ``Conditions improve to the west, with about one-fifth of
Illinois' topsoils rated either short or surplus, and 28 percent of
Iowa rated short and 72 percent adequate,'' the report said. ``This
contrasts favorably with the situation 12 months ago, when topsoils
rated 81 percent short in Iowa and 44 percent short in Illinois.''
   But the report said subsoil moisture ``remains surprisingly low
in the western Corn Belt, with Iowa reporting 76 percent short and
Nebraska 88 percent short.''
   Th report showed that it would take up to seven inches of
additional precipitation to restore subsoil moisture reserves,
although most parched areas of the northern plains would need less
than that.
   ``For North Dakota, the nation's most important spring wheat
state, all indicators show that drought remains a concern,'' the
report said. ``A dry March, following the driest winter on record,
did nothing to remove the lingering effects of the 1988 drought.''
   Although North Dakota is most affected right now, surrounding
states also are of concern, and the area ``clearly bears close
watching in coming weeks,'' the report said.

   This year is the 50th anniversary of four of
the Agriculture Department's largest research centers.
   R. Dean Plowman, head of the department's Agricultural Research
Service, said observances will be held at various times through
early fall, beginning April 20-21 at the Southern Regional Research
Center, New Orleans, La.
   Others will be July 6-7 at the northern center, Peoria, Ill.;
Sept. 18 at the western center, Albany, Calif.; and Oct. 3-4 at the
eastern center, Philadelphia.
   Plowman said the system was started by the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1938, which authorized USDA to establish regional
laboratories.
   Among the centers' achievements, he said, was a technique for
mass-producing penicillin during World War II, frozen concentrated
orange juice, permanent press cotton fabrics and instant potato
flakes.

<HEAD>House Approves Anti-Price Fixing Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Discount stores would find it easier to sue
manufacturers who refuse to sell to them at the behest of
high-price retailers, under a bill approved by the House.
   Challenging the threat of a veto by President Bush, the House
voted 235-157 Wednesday for legislation restoring discounters'
ability to win jury trials for suits alleging that their
competitors and manufacturers conspired to keep retail prices from
falling below a fixed level.
   ``Consumers must now buy highbrow fashions at ritzy-glitzy
prices because highbrow and ritzy-glitzy (suppliers) can discuss
price ranges and still be exempt from antitrust laws,'' said Rep.
Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla.
   ``And they can shut out rock-bottom discounters who want to sell
the same thing to a consumer at a lower price.''
   The legislation was introduced following the Justice
Department's refusal to pursue any vertical price-fixing cases
under the nation's antitrust laws since 1981, when Republicans
assumed control of the White House.
   Compounding the problem, according to consumers groups, were
Supreme Court decisions in 1984 and 1988 that dismissed private
suits because discounters had not shown that their supplies were
cut off because they were charging prices below those suggested by
a manufacturer.
   The legislation was supported by 42 of the nation's 50 state
attorneys general, who contend that such price collusion often is
done with a nod, and without a paper trail of written formal
agreements.
   The result, according to Consumers Union, is that larger dealers
are coercing manufacturers to terminate contracts with rival
discounters, and various brand names are disappearing from the
shelves of discount stores.
   Kristin Rand, a lawyer for the consumer group, cited a suit
dismissed by a federal judge in New York in January in which Kids
'R' Us, a nationwide discounter of children's clothing, accused
Macy's of pressuring two manufacturers of children's swimwear to
stop supplying it.
   Although the judge found evidence of coercion on the part of
Macy's, she said, there was no automatic presumption of an
antitrust violation because there was no agreement on a specific
price or price level.
   ``Price fixing is now proliferating because of the lax
enforcement of our antitrust laws,'' said the bill's chief sponsor,
Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas.
   Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has estimated
that consumers are paying an extra $20 billion as a result of a
combination of the court rulings and the reluctance of the Justice
Department to pursue antitrust violations.
   Democrats beat back three Republican amendments to weaken the
bill. However, on a voice vote the House did approve an amendment
by Rep. Carlos Moorhead, R-Calif., to not apply the new evidentiary
standards retroactively.
   Similar legislation has been approved by Senate Judiciary
Committee, although Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah have threatened to mount a
filibuster if it's brought to the Senate floor.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the White House Office of
Management and Budget have said they would recommend that Bush veto
the bill.
   OMB said in a statement of administration policy that the bill
would interfere with manufacturers' rights to determine who will
distribute their products and expressed fears that juries would
``misinterpret lawful business decisions as price-fixing
conspiracies.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Opposes Economic Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is determined to stop
Congress from imposing economic sanctions on Iraq, although it is
worried about alleged Iraqi attempts to build a nuclear and
chemical weapons arsenal.
   Some U.S. officials also oppose a proposed congressional
resolution condemning Iraq's ``consistent pattern'' of human rights
violations, said a congressional source who asked not to be
identified.
   The non-binding resolution faced a vote today in the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights. It cites, among other
violations, Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish
minority in 1988 and persistent repression of all political
opposition.
   The administration is mainly concerned, however, with draft
legislation being sponsored by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., that
would ban all U.S. aid to Iraq.
   The administration is particularly opposed to a provision in the
draft bill that would ban credits and loans by the government's
Export-Import Bank for Iraqi agriculture, said Edward Gnehm, Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Persian Gulf affairs.
   Gnehm, speaking at a seminar on Wednesday, said the
administration's ``policy on sanctions is to oppose them.'' And he
added, ``our objective will be to see that it (the bill) doesn't
pass.''
   Iraq, he said, ``is an important country, with an important role
to play in the region. We hope this role will be a constructive
one.''
   The administration believes that sanctions would antagonize
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and reduce U.S. influence over his
policies.
   Iraq has the world's second-largest proven oil reserves, and
U.S. dependence on imported oil from the Persian Gulf region is
growing. Iraq also has the region's biggest military force,
battle-tried during its nine-year war with Iran.
   But ties with the United States have been strained in recent
weeks over a series of disclosures about Iraqi actions.
   Gnehm cited a warning by Saddam that his country would use
chemical weapons against Israel if attacked, which he called
``inflammatory''; last month's exposure of an Iraqi ring allegedly
trying to smuggle nuclear triggers for atomic bombs, and an alleged
plot by an Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations to kill two
political opponents.
   ``Recent Iraqi actions have raised serious questions in our mind
about Iraqi intentions,'' he said. ``Iraq cannot flout our laws and
act in ways which call its international commitments into question
with impunity.''
   He urged the Iraqi government to ``take early action to allay
the concerns we have about its recent behavior.''
   Although Saddam has denied he intends to develop nuclear arms,
Gnehm said Iraq continues to try and develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.

<HEAD>Air Traffic Modernization Program Criticized</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The multibillion-dollar effort to overhaul the
air traffic control network has become mired in delays, contract
disputes and unjustified purchases, congressional auditors say.
   In testimony Wednesday to the House Appropriations subcommittee
on transportation, representatives of the General Accounting Office
cited ``fundamental weaknesses'' in the procurement process.
   Those weaknesses ``have resulted in expensive, inadequately
justified procurements, continued delays in the development and
delivery of important elements of air traffic control modernization
and increased risk that some air traffic control systems will be
stressed beyond their capacities,'' a GAO report said.
   It recommended that the Transportation Department re-evaluate
the $1.7 billion Mode S transponder program in the overhaul plan
and consider ``all alternatives ... including terminating the
contract in whole or in part.''
   And it said the Federal Aviation Administration, an agency of
the Transportation Department, should cancel its $1.5 billion
Computer Resources Nucleus project, which is largely unrelated to
the air traffic overhaul.
   A transponder is a device used to signal an airplane's identity
to a traffic control radar. The Mode S makes it possible to
``read'' an airplane's altitude in addition to its location. The
first fully capable Mode S system out of 396 the FAA plans to
purchase won't be delivered until April 1993, five years late, the
GAO said.
   It said the program also is mired in contract disputes.
   Additionally, the GAO said there have been delays in shipping
critical parts for the $5 billion Advanced Automation System for
air traffic control. This increases the burden on terminal radar
approach control facilities, or TRACONS, a critical element in
maintaining the safe separation of aircraft, GAO said.
   The transponder system and the automation system are part of the
National Airspace Plan, the government's blueprint since 1981 for
modernizing the air transportation network. It was originally
estimated to take 10 years and cost nearly $12 billion.
   Critics say the technology for the program has become obsolete
while delays and new projects have added to its completion date and
overall cost.
   FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said the agency was studying the
GAO's recommendations and would prepare a response that would be
part of a formal report.
   The agency has defended its program elsewhere, blaming problems
on the unprecedented growth in air traffic.
   The National Airspace System Plan ``will develop the technology
and expertise that American companies will sell all over the
world,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in a speech
earlier this year.
   The FAA is requesting $2.5 billion for fiscal 1991 for the plan.
That represents a 45 percent increase over the previous year's
funding.

<HEAD>US, Japan to Negotiate Over Unfair Trade Allegation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, which is pushing
Japan to lower its barriers to the sale of American and other
foreign goods, is launching talks on another product _ amorphous
metals.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said Wednesday the United
States and Japan have agreed to negotiate in an effort to resolve
allegations of unfair trade practices being brought by a New
Jersey-based company, Allied Signal Inc.
   Hills said that while negotiations are under way, she will delay
action for five months on a petition the company filed seeking
economic retaliation against Japan.
   The dispute, because it involves a high-technology product with
the potential for big sales, is considered a major test case in the
administration's new efforts to break down trade barriers in Japan.
   Allied Signal, headquartered in Morristown, N.J., filed its
petition with Hills' office on March 5 alleging that it has been
unfairly blocked from selling its invention in Japan for more than
a decade. Marketed under the name Metglas, the product is used in
electric transformers, where it cuts energy transmission losses.
   The company contends that the potential worldwide market for the
product is $1 billion annually and that it has been barred from
Japan because the Japanese government wanted to foster development
of a rival amorphous metal product.
   In announcing her decision, Hills said she would expedite review
of a new petition from Allied Signal seeking retaliation if the
talks over the next 150 days fail to resolve the dispute.
   Allied Signal Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said he accepted
the administration's decision to negotiate in light of recent
actions by Japan to lower barriers to foreign products.
   ``The recently announced progress in the trade talks between the
United States and Japan holds out the promise that trade issues
between the two nations can be resolved in a more businesslike and
less confrontational manner,'' he said in a statement.
   Sen. John Danforth, a leading congressional critic of Japan,
said the administration would have to be ``dogged in its pursuit''
of a successful resolution of the dispute.
   ``The bottom line has to be results in the form of export sales
for a U.S. firm that is being shut out by Japan,'' Danforth, R-Mo.,
said in statement.

   In the harsh world of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary, Wilbert Rideau can do pretty much what he wants _
except get out.
   In prison for murdering a woman by slitting her throat and
stabbing her in the heart, he has become a prize-winning journalist
in his 29 years behind bars.
   But his high profile has led authorities to keep him locked up,
says Rideau, who claims he'd be a free man if he had spent his time
making license plates instead.
   ``I've tried to make amends the best I could in the only ways
available to me. I've done things that counted over the last 29
years,'' Rideau said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``That was
the only violent act of my life, done when I was a wild teen-ager.
If I could change it, I would.''
   On Wednesday, the Louisiana Pardon Board recommended _ for the
fourth time in six years _ that Rideau be set free. Gov. Buddy
Roemer said he is inclined to reject the unanimous recommendation
to commute Rideau's life sentence.
   Rideau is serving time for the 1961 murder of bank teller Julia
Ferguson during a robbery in the southwest Louisiana town of Lake
Charles. Then 19, he got away with $14,279 stuffed in a suitcase.
Wielding his pistol, he forced two tellers and the branch manager
into a car.
   He drove them to a deserted road and shot all three. When Mrs.
Ferguson begged for her life, Rideau killed her. The two others
survived.
   Rideau, 48, who fancies designer jeans and cowboy boots as his
prison gear, has been called a model inmate by prison officials.
   The editor of the prison magazine, The Angolite, he also gives
lectures to youth groups and gets out to go on national speaking
tours on prison reform. Over the years, Rideau, who works out of
the magazine office, has had a literary agent and written
free-lance articles for up to four figures for publications such as
Penthouse.
   Rideau has won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, the
American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the George Polk
Award for special interest reporting.
   The Polk award came on two articles in The Angolite, ``Prison: a
Sexual Jungle,'' dealing with homosexual rape, and ``The Other Side
of Murder,'' which told of the aftermath of a killing.
   The Angolite, which has carried stories on inmate suicides,
prison riots, prisoner rights, executions, prison sports and
special events, was featured in The New York Times Sunday Magazine
and has been praised in Time magazine, The Washington Post and
Columbia Journalism Review.
   Rideau has appeared on national TV, including ABC's
``Nightline,'' on which he was on a five-man panel with former
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in a discussion of prison reform.
   And that is why, Rideau thinks, he's still in prison.
   ``Let's face it, they've released thousands of murderers since
I've been in prison. I've watched them come in and go out _ all
anonymous,'' he said.
   ``The governor hasn't searched out the families of their victims
to talk to. They've managed to get out because their greatest
achievement as a prisoner was that they remained anonymous.''
   Of the 31 prisoners sentenced to either death or life in prison
sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary in 1962, only Rideau remains
behind bars.
   ``It's not like I'm asking for special treatment or
consideration, not when the system has released everybody else
routinely convicted of the same or worse crimes. The system exists
for everybody else in the state but Wilbert Rideau,'' he said.
   Wednesday was the seventh time Rideau has applied for clemency.
He initially was sentenced to death, but that was commuted to life
in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death penalty.
   He must wait one year to reapply.
   ``I'll try again next year,'' he said. ``What choice do I have?
I can't sit down and talk to the governor so the only hope I have
is to go to the pardon board.''

   A two-day conference on global warming brought
to the surface the polarization between much of Europe and the
United States over the question of global warming and the need for
action.
   The conference produced little to indicate the Bush
administration will abandon its go-slow, cautious policy and adopt
the more aggressive posture held by many of the European countries.
   President Bush, in closing the international conference
Wednesday, declared his ``commitment to action, to sound analysis
and sound policies'' in tackling the problem of manmade pollution
that scientists say is causing a warming of the earth.
   ``The climate change debate is not about `research versus
action,' for we have never considered research a substitute for
action,'' he told the delegates from 18 nations.
   But neither Bush nor other senior administration officials
suggested that the administration is prepared to embrace the
aggressive response strategies discussed by some European delegates.
   No one at the White House discussed possible timetables for
reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Allan Bromley, the president's
science adviser and co-chairman of the conference, repeatedly
emphasized the session was aimed at dealing with unresolved
scientific issues and economics, not response or policy issues.
   The president did not mention action plans when he welcomed the
delegates on Tuesday, prompting criticism from the European
delegations. Environmentalists contended Bush allowed the
leadership mantle to fall into European hands on the global warming
issue.
   ``Worldwide action is urgently needed even if all the complex
scientific causal relationships of climate changes have not been
firmly established,'' Klaus Topfer, the West German environment
minister, told the delegates.
   The Europeans argue enough already is known to launch prudent
plans for cutting carbon dioxide, which comes largely from the
burning of fossil fuels and accounts for half of the global warming
problem.
   The Dutch favor a commitment as soon as possible by the
industrial countries to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by the
year 2000. The European Community may well make such a commitment
without U.S. participation this summer.
   West Germany informed the delegates it plans to draft a proposal
for a 25 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions in Germany by the
year 2005. The Canadians also said they plan to develop carbon
dioxide reduction goals.
   The Bush administration, however, has made no indication it will
join soon in taking similar actions, suggesting instead that the
global warming threat and the economic impact must still be better
understood.
   European delegates scoffed at those statements.
   ``A stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is not a matter of
economic constraints, but it is a matter of political will,'' Hans
Alders, the Dutch environmental minister, told the delegates.
   Within the Bush administration there appears to be no similar
sense of urgency. Asked about a timetable, Energy Secretary James
Watkins suggested in an interview that a plan for specific carbon
dioxide controls might not be prudent until the middle of the
decade.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly suggested it could be
considerably sooner. He said the United States still hopes to join
negotiations late this year or early in 1991 on developing a
framework that would eventually be the basis for an international
treaty to cut global warming pollutants.
   Meanwhile, the White House tried to put its own ``spin'' on the
global warming issue during the conference, according to an
internal document that found its way to environmental activists,
who provided it to reporters.
   The guidelines, presumably for administration officials
attending the conference, included a section on ``debates to
avoid.'' It wasn't clear who drew up the ``talking points,''
although administration officials said they were authentic.
   The document warned against discussions of whether there is too
much warming of the Earth because ``in the eyes of the public we
will lose this debate.''
   Other things not to do, according to the White House guidelines:
   _``Don't get into an advocacy position of the merits of the
various policy proposals.''
   _``Don't use specific numbers (degrees, dollars, rates, etc.)''
when discussing how the conference is ``accelerating the
international discussion and understanding of these issues.''
   _Finally, ``don't let reporters position this conference as an
attempt to delay serious decisions on this issue.''
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency and
one of the administration's leading spokesmen on global warming
issues, said he was aware of the document, but that he frequently
talks about many of the subjects outlined in the ``don't'' section.

   Even the safety and health hazards at the top
of 1986 fix-up lists for the government's nuclear weapons plants
hadn't been fixed at the beginning of 1990, says a report to
Congress.
   As of January, the government and its contractors had taken care
of just 41 percent of the highest priority problems in the weapons
complex, and overall had resolved just 34 percent of the health and
safety problems identified since 1986, the General Accounting
Office said.
   ``It is shocking that nuclear hazards requiring immediate
attention got no attention at all,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, who released the report Wednesday with Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif.
   ``Our work raises questions about the (Energy Department's)
commitment to resolving its problems in a timely manner,'' said the
report by the GAO, Congress' investigative arm.
   The department refused to comment on the report before officials
got a chance to review it. However, the report's authors got their
data from the department's computers and discussed the data with
DOE officials.
   ``It would seem to us unlikely that it would reveal anything we
weren't already aware of,'' DOE spokesman Robert Griffin said.
``Certainly Admiral Watkins (Secretary James D. Watkins) is aware
of the magnitude of the environmental problems faced by the
department.''
   According to the report, the Energy Department has logged 113
radiation and other problems that posed ``a clear and present
danger to workers or the public.''
   There were 36 such problems at the Rocky Flats plant in
Colorado, of which 23 were resolved; 33 at Savannah River, S.C., of
which one was resolved; 30 at the Y-12 Plant in Tennessee, of which
12 were resolved; 14 at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in
California, of which 10 were resolved.
   When all types of safety and health problems were added up, the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state had the largest
total, 294, of which 89 had been taken care of. Rocky Flats' total
was 262, with 142 problems resolved; and the Feed Material
Production Center at Fernald, Ohio, was ranked third with 186
problems, 46 of which were resolved.
   Data on environmental hazards showed Fernald had more problems
than any other plant _ 68 in all. Among the other major plants,
Savannah River and Lawrence Livermore were second with 65
environmental problems; Los Alamos, N.M., and Idaho Lab each had
59; Hanford and Y-12 each had 58; Pantex in Amarillo, Texas, had
56; and Portsmouth, Ohio, had 55.
   At 31 Energy Department-owned nuclear weapons plants and
research laboratories, 1,277 environmental problems were logged,
including 44 radioactive contamination problems, the report said.
   ``All of these problems are considered by DOE to be
unresolved,'' it said.
   The department told the GAO none of those 1,277 problems pose an
immediate health threat. However, 192 of those problems involve ``a
high risk for a threat to health,'' and Fernald had 31 problems in
that category _ more than any other plant.
   The government has acknowledged the environmental problems at
the plants, but the report criticized the slow pace at which it has
drawn up plans to fix the problems. Nine plants don't have such
plans, and where the plans have been completed they were, on
average, six months late.
   ``We know the problems are complex but that is no excuse for
DOE's failure even to come with plans to clean up the hundreds of
nuclear hazards,'' Metzenbaum said in a statement.

   The best pitches at Dodger Stadium don't
always start on the mound.
   Up in the stands, peanut vendor Roger Owens can fire bags of
goobers to fans up to 30 rows away.
   Closer to the target, he can make behind-the-back and
under-the-leg tosses. Then there's the split-nut shot. Two double
bags of peanuts, thrown simultaneously, separate in flight and head
toward two targets.
   And when one hand gives, the other takes. Owens sells an average
of 700 bags of peanuts per game at Dodger Stadium _ at a buck each.
   His all-time record was at Texas Stadium during a Dallas Cowboys
game in 1976, when he sold 2,400 single bags. Two years ago, Owens
sold 6,000 bags during three days at the Southeast Regionals of the
NCAA basketball tournament.
   The 47-year-old Owens, who pitched baseballs for the Manual Arts
High School team years ago, began his career with the Dodgers in
1958 as a soda vendor. He was promoted to peanuts that same season.
   In search of a sales pitch, he looked to his strong arm and gift
of gab. By 1977, he was invited to the presidential inauguration of
peanut farmer Jimmy Carter.
   Owens is writing a biography titled ``The Peanut Man.''
   ``It'll show that no matter what job you take, if you do the
best you can, you can go to the top,'' Owens said. ``Even with this
menial peanut-vending job, I've been able to take it to the top and
turn it into a career.''

   ``Easy listening'' music can do more
to put people on edge than silence can, researchers say.
   Music fans eager to relax should simply reach for the type of
music they already enjoy, the researchers said.
   ``Some people don't relax to certain types of music because they
don't like it,'' said Valerie Stratton, a Penn State University
assistant professor of psychology.
   ``The subject might even become more tense than without music,''
said Annette Zalanowski, an assistant professor of music.
   The pair exposed dozens of people to a variety of music and
polled them on how relaxed they felt during each piece.
   Atonal music from 20th century composers and non-Western music
billed as relaxing fared the worst, Stratton said. Rock 'n' roll
wasn't used because lyrics could skew a person's true response to
the music, she said.
   Music from India was panned because the 84 college-age people
tested were unaccustomed to it, the researchers said.
   ``No single type of music was most effective in aiding
relaxation, and no significant differences were found between
soothing and stimulating music,'' the researchers said.

<HEAD>German Industry Seeks U.S. Investment in East Germany, Eastern
Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German industry is urging U.S. companies
to join in a more-the-merrier spirit and invest in East Germany and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   ``There are vast opportunities for Western business,'' Ludolf
von Wartenberg, president of the Federation of German Industries
(BDI), said Wednesday in a speech to the American Institute for
Contemporary German Studies.
   Von Wartenberg said West German subsidiaries of American
companies, like Ford, General Moters and IBM, are actively looking
for investment opportunities like major West German and other West
European-owned firms. But he said he came to the United States in
part to encourage U.S. companies without a foothold in Europe to
join in.
   ``Japan is very interested,'' he said, noting that it has set up
an office in Berlin and is looking to move into East Germany.
   Von Wartenberg acknowledged that West German companies have a
competitive advantage, but said he expected 30 percent of firms in
East Germany eventually would be foreign-owned, the same percentage
as in West Germany.
   ``Enormous investments are necessary in infrastructure, above
all telecommunications, where the current standards are deplorable,
but also roads, railroads, the vast area of financial and
consulting services, and to some extent tourism.''
   East German industry will have to undergo a drastic
transformation because it is so inefficient and polluting, he said.
Many plants will have to be rebuilt from the ground up, and the
workforce will have to become much more productive.

   Wolfensohn said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu promised
him that the administration would support the Kennedy Center.
   ``If they don't come through with the money, I think I'll

   Several universities are telling the Pentagon
a military policy barring homosexuals from service is generating
pressure to oust ROTC from their campuses.
   ``The contradiction between the university's principle of
non-discrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual
orientation, and the presence of an ROTC that does discriminate,
cannot exist on the campuses indefinitely,'' John M. Deutch,
provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a
letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Many universities will withdraw from the ROTC program,''
Deutch wrote.
   The Department of Defense has declined to comment on the campus
challenges on grounds the homosexual ban is being challenged in
court.
   The department has limited responses to a written statement
outlining its grounds for barring homosexuals _ that homosexuality
is incompatible with military service because of the close quarters
in which people of the same sex must live and because of the
security risk posed by the possibility of a homosexual officer
being blackmailed.
   Top administrators, faculty groups and students from MIT, the
University of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, Northwestern
University and others have actively campaigned against the Reserve
Officer Training Corps policy.
   No ROTC program has been removed from a campus as a result of
the opposition.

<HEAD>GM Expediting Electric Car Production, Smith Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is pushing development of
an electrically powered car in recognition of consumer demand for a
cleaner environment, says GM Chairman Roger B. Smith.
   The nation's largest automaker intends to be the first to
mass-market the vehicle, Smith said in a speech Wednesday to the
National Press Club. GM unveiled a prototype vehicle, the Impact,
in January.
   He refused to say when or where the car would be built or to
reveal technical information about the vehicle, saying he did not
want to tip off competitors. In the 1970s, GM announced it would
produce a 1985-model electric car, but it dropped that project long
before production.
   Smith said the goal is to manufacture a car that would match
today's safety and performance standards without the air pollution
of an internal combustion engine. Generation of the electricity, of
course, would create other pollution if fossil fuels were used in
the power plant.
   ``We have set an aggressive schedule for ourselves in order to
pull along the technological developments that we still need,''
Smith said.
   Still needed is a better battery, and Smith said that may
require joint development by automakers, utilities, battery
manufacturers and the federal government.
   Though obstacles remain, ``when we look at the strict clean-air
legislation that's now being proposed for many areas of the
country, we're convinced that the Impact has a bright future.''

   In the harsh world of the Louisiana State
Penitentiary, Wilbert Rideau can do pretty much what he wants _
except get out.
   In prison for murdering a woman by slitting her throat and
stabbing her in the heart, he has become a prize-winning journalist
in his 29 years behind bars.
   But his high profile has led authorities to keep him locked up,
says Rideau, who claims he'd be a free man if he had spent his time
making license plates instead.
   ``I've tried to make amends the best I could in the only ways
available to me. I've done things that counted over the last 29
years,'' Rideau said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``That was
the only violent act of my life, done when I was a wild teen-ager.
If I could change it, I would.''
   On Wednesday, the Louisiana Pardon Board recommended _ for the
fourth time in six years _ that Rideau be set free. Gov. Buddy
Roemer said he is inclined to reject the unanimous recommendation
to commute Rideau's life sentence.
   Rideau is serving time for the 1961 murder of bank teller Julia
Ferguson during a robbery in the southwest Louisiana town of Lake
Charles. Then 19, he got away with $14,279 stuffed in a suitcase.
Wielding his pistol, he forced two tellers and the branch manager
into a car.
   He drove them to a deserted road and shot all three. When Mrs.
Ferguson begged for her life, Rideau killed her. The two others
survived.
   Rideau, 48, who fancies designer jeans and cowboy boots as his
prison gear, has been called a model inmate by prison officials.
   The editor of the prison magazine, The Angolite, he also gives
lectures to youth groups and gets out to go on national speaking
tours on prison reform. Over the years, Rideau, who works out of
the magazine office, has had a literary agent and written
free-lance articles for up to four figures for publications such as
Penthouse.
   Rideau has won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, the
American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award and the George Polk
Award for special interest reporting.
   The Polk award came on two articles in The Angolite, ``Prison: a
Sexual Jungle,'' dealing with homosexual rape, and ``The Other Side
of Murder,'' which told of the aftermath of a killing.
   The Angolite, which has carried stories on inmate suicides,
prison riots, prisoner rights, executions, prison sports and
special events, was featured in The New York Times Sunday Magazine
and has been praised in Time magazine, The Washington Post and
Columbia Journalism Review.
   Rideau has appeared on national TV, including ABC's
``Nightline,'' on which he was on a five-man panel with former
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in a discussion of prison reform.
   And that is why, Rideau thinks, he's still in prison.
   ``Let's face it, they've released thousands of murderers since
I've been in prison. I've watched them come in and go out _ all
anonymous,'' he said.
   ``The governor hasn't searched out the families of their victims
to talk to. They've managed to get out because their greatest
achievement as a prisoner was that they remained anonymous.''
   Of the 31 prisoners sentenced to either death or life in prison
sent to Louisiana State Penitentiary in 1962, only Rideau remains
behind bars.
   ``It's not like I'm asking for special treatment or
consideration, not when the system has released everybody else
routinely convicted of the same or worse crimes. The system exists
for everybody else in the state but Wilbert Rideau,'' he said.
   Wednesday was the seventh time Rideau has applied for clemency.
He initially was sentenced to death, but that was commuted to life
in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death penalty.
   He must wait one year to reapply.
   ``I'll try again next year,'' he said. ``What choice do I have?
I can't sit down and talk to the governor so the only hope I have
is to go to the pardon board.''

   ``First: In compliance with the desire and insistence of Islamic

efforts in this sphere, we have decided to move the hostages affair
forward by releasing an American hostage within 48 hours on the
basis of reciprocal move to accomplish what is required to
accelarate the happy ending.
   ``Second: We want the humanitarian move to be balanced between
both sides. This is a condition to move forward. Otherwise there is
no meaning for a one-sided movement. We have responded to the
behests, hoping to reach a solution as proposed and on the basis of
the verbal message that will be conveyed to President Bush. We are
ready to reciprocate or escalate. The other side has to choose.
   ``Third: The arrangements for the release should be accomplished
by the arrival of John Kelly in Damascus to coordinate some final
steps to guarantee success within 48 hours.

   A Supreme Court ruling allowing judges
to order schools to raise taxes for desegregation wouldn't have
come about if lawmakers and the public had met their
responsibility, says the head of Kansas City's schools.
   The high court ruled 9-0 Wednesday that judges cannot directly
impose a tax increase, as U.S. District Judge Russell Clark did in
the Kansas City case in 1987. But in a 5-4 vote it upheld a federal
appeals court decision that Clark could instead order the school
board to raise taxes.
   Julia Hill, newly elected school board president, said the issue
wouldn't have even been before the court if voters hadn't turned
down school tax increases time and again.
   ``I would have loved for the previous tax levies to pass when
they were presented to the public _ sometimes three times,'' she
said at a news conference.
   ``When democracy fails, sometimes people have to pay. And
democracy failed here in Kansas City, and it also failed at the
state level.
   ``All of this could have been alleviated by changing some
boundary lines 20 years ago. But nobody did anything, so we're at a
state now where we're under a federal court order.''
   Before 1954, Missouri law required schools to be racially
segregated. In the following 35 years, the percentage of black
students in Kansas City's school district rose from 22.5 percent to
about 75 percent.
   Black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become
predominantly black schools, alleging black students were being
denied equal educational opportunities.
   Clark ruled in 1987 that the schools ``have literally rotted,''
and ordered state and district officials to upgrade them. He
ordered the state to pay three-fourths of the remedial costs and
the school district the rest.
   District voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to raise
taxes for education.
   Clark had nearly doubled the local property tax from $2.05 to $4
per $100 of assessed valuation to help finance the improvements.
The increase raised about $30 million.
   Civil rights forces praised the Supreme Court decision.
   ``It's a powerful reaffirmation that state laws may not impede
the vindication of constitutional rights, the rights of school
children,'' said Paul Holtzman of the Washington-based Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

<HEAD>State to Demolish 34 Buildings on Seedy Times Square</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The peep shows and X-rated theaters of Times
Square will give way to four new office towers now that the state
has won the right to demolish 34 buildings in a long-delayed, $2.5
billion renewal project.
   State and city officials hope that replacing the sex shops and
other run-down buildings will revitalze the area and rout the
prostitutes, drug pushers and muggers that give Times Square its
seedy reputation.
   State Supreme Court Justice Stanley J. Parness signed an order
Wednesday giving the state Urban Development Corp. title to the 34
properties.
   The project, first approved in 1984, is the nation's largest
urban redevelopment project.
   ``After seven years, after 48 lawsuits, we are finally taking
possession of the property,'' said state Director of Economic
Development Vincent Tese. ``We now own it.''
   The tenants will be moved out and demolition could begin as
early as summer, he said.
   Critics charge that the towers are too big, the tax abatements
granted to builders too large and the real estate market too soft
to warrant the new office space.
   But backers say the project will create 16,000 construction jobs
and 20,000 permanent jobs when the towers are completed in four
years.
   The buildings will be glitzed up with neon signs, lights and
mirrors to preserve the area's character. The developers also plan
to renovate the dilapidated Times Square subway station and nine
theaters.
   The idea is to discourage drug dealers, muggers, con artists and
prostitutes in an area where 2,246 felonies were reported on 42nd
Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in 1988.
   ``This is a milestone for the economy of New York,'' Gov. Mario
Cuomo said. ``It will make 42nd Street a safe, productive part of
the city's entertainment district.''
   The project's developers, Prudential Insurance Co. and Park
Tower Realty, have put up $241 million to compensate the landowners.
   Gary Rosenberg, lawyer for the Durst Organization, which filed
three lawsuits against the project, said his organization had 30
days to decide whether to appeal the condemnation order.
   In the last year, Durst acquired 70-year leaseholds for eight
theaters. Despite the threat of condemnation, it is renovating the
theaters and has spent more than $3 million so far to repair roofs
and facades.
   A hotel and merchandise mart are also on the drawing board. Tese
said Wednesday's decision also should spur action on those plans.

<HEAD>Sex of Embryos Revealed by New Technique Before Pregnancy Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who sought to have baby girls have been
impregnated with female embryos selected from a test tube,
scientists reported today.
   The results, obtained by way of a new embryo-screening procedure
designed to prevent genetic diseases, are the first reported
pregnancies using embryos tested to reveal gender, researchers said
in the British journal Nature.
   Two of three pregnant women expect twins this summer, study
co-author Alan Handyside said in a telephone interview. The third
expects one child, he said.
   The laboratory test identified the sex of the microscopic
embryos only three days after fertilization, he said.
   The women were at risk of transmitting serious genetic diseases
to a male child, Handyside said. The test also could be used
without a medical justification to select the sex of a child. But
Handyside said he would consider that unethical.
   Further research might provide a way to screen out embryos that
would develop serious genetic diseases, thereby removing the
prospect of abortions in those cases, researchers said.
   The work was reported by Handyside and colleagues at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School at Hammsmith Hospital in London.
   Lab techniques have been used before to determine a baby's sex.
In 1986, a New Orleans fertility institute announced the birth of a
boy whose sex had been selected during ``in vitro'' fertilization,
which is done in the laboratory. That case involved selecting sperm
to produce a boy.
   But sperm selection has not proved reliable, said Dr. Maria
Bustillo of the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va. And it
does not hold the promise of diagnosing genetic diseases before an
embryo is implanted, as embryo analysis does, she said Wednesday.
   It is not clear how many couples would choose the embryo
analysis, which requires in vitro fertilization, rather than
conceiving naturally and then considering an abortion after
undergoing a standard genetic analysis of the fetus, she said.
   But it may be possible someday to allow a woman to conceive
naturally and then flush out the embryo for analysis, she said,
then reimplant it if desired.
   Some 200 genetic diseases that typically affect only boys have
been identified, including the most severe form of muscular
dystrophy, hemophilia and a form of mental retardation, Handyside
said.
   The embryo analysis involves collecting eggs from a woman,
fertilizing them in a test tube and letting them grow to eight-cell
embryos. A single cell is removed from each embryo to see if it
contains a bit of genetic material that indicates the presence of a
Y chromosome, which would mean the embryo is destined to become a
boy.
   The three pregnant women were each given two embryos to increase
the chance of pregnancy, Handyside said.
   For families that risk passing on serious genetic disease to
males, the embryo procedure should be less emotionally trying than
an abortion, said pediatrician and ethicist Dr. Kathleen Nolan at
the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
   She and ethicist Arthur Caplan at the University of Minnesota
said the technique is probably too cumbersome and costly to make it
widely popular for choosing a baby's sex without any medical reason.
   But they said thorny issues could arise if researchers find an
easier way to analyze genetic traits of an embryo and learn to
predict a variety of diseases and personal traits.
   Many people would oppose using embryo analysis to pick a child's
hair color or sex for no medical reason, just as many would support
use of the technique if the embryo were certain to develop a

   ``Some might consider it socially very undesirable for a woman

obese ... since those children are likely to get into more medical

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared Thursday,
while the dollar closed sharply lower against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 787.46 points on
Wednesday, added another 696.35 points, or 2.38 percent, to end the
day at 29,945.41.
   The dollar closed at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from Wednesday's
close of 159.87 yen. The currency opened at 158.35 yen and ranged
between 157.60 yen and 158.50 yen.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei index's surge largely to the yen's
strength against the dollar.
   ``Inspired by the yen's recovery, market players started buying
issues to which they have been paying little attention,'' said a
trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the market appears to have entered a rising phase after
a series of plunges earlier this year.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's slide followed its downswing
in New York Wednesday, despite a report of a sharp improvement in
the U.S. merchandise trade figures for February.
   ``Japanese investors had bought the dollar earlier expecting the
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit, and they started selling the
dollar before the figure actually came out yesterday,'' said Minori
Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The trade deficit narrowed to $6.49 billion in February, its
lowest level in six years, from a revised $9.32 billion in January,
largely because of a sharp drop in oil imports. Past improvements
in the trade deficit have usually helped the dollar, but some
analysts suggested that the latest improvement may not last.
   ``Many market players are still doubtful that the decrease in
the U.S. deficit will continue,'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   She said investors are trying to test the dollar's bottom, and
added, ``The dollar will slide as low as 157 yen.''
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond was quoted at 86.26 points, up from Wednesday's close of
86.14. That dropped the yield to 7.31 percent from 7.335 percent.

   Here's a look at what is at stake economically for
Lithuania and the Soviet Union if the Baltic republic is isolated:
   
   IN THE SOVIET ECONOMIC ARSENAL
   _ Lithuania receives all of its oil, gas and diesel fuel from
the Soviet Union, paying subsidized prices. At world market prices,
Lithuania would run a deficit of $700 million for oil alone.
   _ It also receives all of its metals, cotton, tractors and
automobiles from the Soviet Union.
   _ It receives 58 percent of its sugar from Cuba, via the Soviet
Union.
   _ It receives 37 percent of its concentrated fertilizer from the
Soviet Union. Cotton, 100 percent.
   _ It received 400,000 tons of grain from the Soviets in 1989.
   _ It has only four to five days' supply of newsprint, and the
Soviets could cut off the supply, thus shutting down its newspapers.
   
   IN LITHUANIA'S ECONOMIC ARSENAL
   _ The republic sends to the Soviet Union 1.5 percent of the
nation's total production, including household electrical meters
(100 percent); television set components (70 percent); and tractor
components (30 percent).
   _ It produces much more meat (530,000 metric tons in 1987), eggs
(1.2 million metric tons in 1987), milk (3.1 million metric tons in
1987) and other dairy products than it consumes, so it could cut
off the rest of the Soviet Union from its surplus.
   _ Textile products are shipped to factories in the Soviet Union,
including one plant in Leningrad that employs 18,000 workers.
   _ The shutdown of the pipeline to the Mazeikiai refinery also
means a curtailment of supplies to the republics of Estonia, Latvia
and Byelorussia. A shutdown of a natural gas pipeline would
interrupt the flow of gas to Kaliningrad, part of the Russian
republic west of Lithuania.
   _ Lithuania could demand world prices for exporting Soviet
products through its Baltic ports, including Klaipeda.

<TEXT>
   Robert Ray, one of three AIDS-exposed
hemophiliac brothers who won a court battle to go to school only to
be burned out of their home by an arsonist, has developed the
disease, his mother says.
   The Ray family learned about two months ago that 12-year-old
Robert had AIDS, his mother, Louise Ray, said Wednesday. The body
was taken out of school to study at home, she said.
   ``It was our decision because of his mood swings. One minute
he's fine, the next he may be crying. It's embarrassing enough. But
then to be crying in front of your friends. And it's something
uncontrollable,'' she said.
   Robert, who had been the healthiest of the three boys, is the
first to progress to the disease. Ricky, 13, and Randy, 11, also
are infected with the AIDS virus.
   Doctors say all three were exposed to the virus through tainted
blood products used to treat their hemophilia before screening
began in 1985.
   Four years ago, the boys were barred from school in Arcadia and
then in Bay Minette, Ala., but in 1987 they were reinstated in
Arcadia by a federal judge. Many parents kept their children home
in protest.
   At the end of the first week of class, the Rays' house burned
down, an unsolved arson. The family moved to Sarasota, where the
boys and their virus-free sister enrolled without incident.
   Robert ``still swims in the pool, rides his bike,'' his mother
said. ``He's doing as well as can be expected. With AIDS you don't
know what to expect.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight more sheriff's officers have been
suspended in an internal investigation into skimming of drug money
in the department's narcotics bureau, bringing to 27 the number
relieved of duty.
   The seven deputies and one sergeant suspended Wednesday were
summoned to City Hall in suburban Santa Fe Springs, relieved of
their weapons and badges and questioned, the department said. They
were suspended with pay.
   They joined 18 other officers from the narcotics bureau and
another officer outside the unit who have been suspended in the
18-month-old probe.
   Sheriff Sherman Block declined to elaborate on why the eight
were suspended, but the inquiry has focused on allegations officers
skimmed money seized from suspected drug dealers.
   Ten deputies suspended earlier and one of their wives were
indicted on charges of stealing more than $1.4 million and using it
to buy cars, homes and stocks.
   ``Although we are saddened by the necessity for this action, the
more than 11,000 honest and hard working men and women of the
Sheriff's Department will continue, as they have, to do their jobs
within integrity,'' said Sheriff Block, who is up for re-election
this year.
   About two years ago the narcotics bureau had 120 deputies and
sergeants. Current numbers were not released.
   The inquiry has hurt at least a dozen drug prosecutions. Most
recently, a convicted dealer serving a five-year sentence was freed
from prison in December after the judge learned sheriff's
investigators may have falsified evidence.
   Prosecutors said deputies may have lied about the circumstances
that led to a search of Trosper Parie's apartment and discovery of
more than 11 pounds of cocaine.

   Mexico says it could curtail joint
anti-drug operations with the United States if it confirms reports
that bounty hunters kidnapped a Mexican doctor to face charges in
the murder of a U.S. drug agent.
   The government said Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo delivered the warning to U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh on Wednesday.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, a suspect in the 1985
torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, was
arrested April 3 in El Paso, Texas. He had reportedly been
kidnapped at his Guadalajara office the previous day.
   Some news reports have said Alvarez Machain was kidnapped by
bounty hunters seeking a $100,000 reward offered by the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Adminstration. The agency has refused to comment on how
he arrived in the United States.
   Other reports say Mexican federal police took Alvarez Machain to
the United States. The Mexican attorney general's office denies
this and the government said Tuesday it had asked the U.S. State
Department to explain how he was apprehended.
   Another investigation has been opened by Mexico's Congress,
where lawmakers are complaining of an affront to their country's
sovereignty.
   Alvarez del Castillo and Thornburgh met Wednesday during a
regional drug enforcement conference.
   ``The Mexican attorney general told the U.S. official that it is
the exclusive province of Mexican authorities to fight narcotics
trafficking in all its forms within its own territory,'' the
government said in a statement.
   ``If it is proved that the suspect was kidnapped and illegally
taken to the United States by authorities of that country, it
endangers the bilateral cooperation in the fight against drug
trafficking, which until now have been excellent,'' the statement
said.
   Thornburgh says he has ordered an investigation into the case.
   The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday quoted unnamed Mexican
sources as saying Alvarez Machain's abduction was arranged by
agents in the Los Angeles DEA office without the knowledge of their
superiors in Washington.
   Alvarez Machain, 42, is one of 19 Mexicans indicted by a federal
grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of kidnapping, torturing and
killing Camarena, a DEA special agent. He was arraigned earlier
this month and pleaded innocent.
   U.S. prosecutors allege that Camarena was abducted by drug
traffickers and tortured by Mexican officials about DEA activities
in Mexico and charges against suspected participants in the
abduction and murder have strained U.S.-Mexican relations.
   U.S. law enforcement officials say Mexico failed to respond to
their requests to extradite several defendants. Mexican officials
say the United States had never requested the extradition of anyone.
   A Jan. 31 indictment returned in Los Angeles contained the
latest charges in the case. Besides Alvarez Machain, it named
Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police, and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, former head of the
Mexican office of Interpol, the international law enforcement
agency.
   Alvarez Machain's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, says his client was
kidnapped but that he would not raise the abduction as a legal
issue because prior rulings in similar cases said, in effect, ``too
bad, but they're here.''
   Steinberg said Alvarez Machain was taken from his Guadalajara
office on April 2 by five men who identified themselves as Mexican
federal police and told the gynecologist he was under arrest for
performing illegal abortions.
   He said that the next day the group placed Alvarez Machain on a
plane to El Paso, where he was arrested by a DEA agent.
   They say fingerprints on a syringe used to drug Camarena were
traced to Alvarez Machain, who allegedly revived the DEA agent when
he lost consciousness after being beaten.
   Alvarez Machain is to face trial in Los Angeles on May 1 along
with four other defendants in the case.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar took a nosedive against the Japanese yen
today, contributing to a surge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief
index as market players actively bought issues.
   The dollar closed at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from Wednesday's
close at 159.87 yen. The currency opened at 158.35 yen and ranged
between 157.60 yen and 158.50 yen.
   The amount of decline in the dollar today was the largest since
Aug. 1, when it lost 2.45 yen overnight to 136.65 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's slide in Tokyo followed its overnight
downswing in New York, despite a report Wednesday of a sharp
improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade figures for February.
   ``Japanese investors had bought the dollar earlier based on
their expectation that the U.S. trade deficit would largely
improve, and then they dumped the currency when the figure actually
came out,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank.
   He said the market did not react to Wednesday's U.S. trade
report because it had already taken into account the expected
decline in the trade deficit.
   ``In an attempt to take profits, many market players sold the
dollar regardless of the figure,'' he said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit
narrowed in February to a six-month low of $6.49 billion from a
revised $9.32 billion deficit the previous month.
   ``The dollar's decline after the 158.50 yen line is not because
of position adjustments,'' he said.
   He said life insurance firms selling dollars were in part trying
to get enough money for the May U.S. bond auction.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
rose 787.46 points Wednesday, posted another 696.35 points, or 2.38
percent, ending the day at 29,945.41 in heavy trading. Volume
traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares, up
from Wednesday's 450 million.
   Traders attributed the index's surge largely to the yen's sharp
recovery.
   ``Market players now believe that they have gotten over with all
the negative elements as the yen and bond prices started
recovering,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior trader with Nikko
Securities Co.
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds was
changing hands at 86.38 points as of 4 p.m., up from Wednesday's
86.14-point close.
   Their yield was quoted at 7.285 percent, down from 7.335 percent
the previous day.
   Shimoyama said the market is recovering by itself after a series
of plunges. The market has lost 8,970.46 points, or 23.1 percent,
from its yearend record-high close at 38,915.87.
   ``Because the index has lost so much, and also from our past
experiences, we believe the market had bottomed out,'' he said, but
added that some uncertainties remain.
   A trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``Inspired by the yen's recovery, market players
started buying issues to which they had been paying little
attention.''
   Traders actively bought shipbuilding, steel and bank issues.

   A woman who police say was killed and then
carved up and boiled by her father was mentally ill and had made
life miserable for her family, her sister says.
   Angela DeChurch, 32, of Atco, N.J., said Wednesday her
38-year-old sister, Carol DiGregorio, had attacked every member of
the family during episodes of paranoid schizophrenia and had
``tortured'' her father and ``treated him terrible.''
   John DiGregorio, 60, was charged with murder and abuse of corpse
in the slaying. Police said he told them he hit his elder daughter
with a tire iron four or five times as she attacked him with a
knife in their Bensalem kitchen Sunday.
   He then cut off her extremities, boiled parts of her body in
three large pots and put her head in the refrigerator's lettuce
crisper, police said.
   Mrs. DeChurch said her father came to her home Monday and told
him what he had done. Her husband called police.
   DiGregorio ``was a wreck,'' she said. ``He couldn't live with
himself. He came to me because he knew we would make a call.''
   In Mrs. DeChurch's eyes, her father committed no crime. ``He
loved my sister probably more than any father could love his
daughter,'' she told the Philadelphia Daily News.
   ``She has attacked me in the past. She has attacked my mother.
She hated herself and she hated him.''
   Neighbors said that the victim constantly screamed at DiGregorio
and that the father had tried hard to keep her home and out of a
mental institution, where she had been previously committed. They
said they admired his devotion to his daughter.
   Ana Rodriguez said DiGregorio on Friday told her his elder
daughter was ``doing bad'' and he feared she would have to go back
to a mental institution.
   Another neighbor, Bill Oakley, said he could tell from Ms.
DiGregorio's clothes and makeup that her mental condition had
deteriorated. Her lipstick was off the side of her mouth, like a
clown's, and dress went from conservative to leather miniskirts, he
said.

   Israeli warplanes blasted unidentified

local radio station reported.
   Voice of the People, mouthpiece of the Lebanese Communist Party,
said the raid was carried out at 10:45 a.m. against unidentified

   The broadcast, which interrupted regular programming to flash

   Police could not immediately confirm the report.
   The Naameh hills house bases for several Palestinian guerrilla
factions as well as bases for Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   The raid, if confirmed, will be the 10th Israeli air attack into
Lebanon this year.
   Israeli helicopter gunships carried out the Jewish state's ninth
air attack into Lebanon this year on April 4, blasting an office of
the Palestinian Communist Party in the southern refugee camp of
Rashidiyeh. Seven people were wounded.
   By police count, 10 people were killed and 29 wounded in the
nine air attacks.

   The chief abortion foe in the Illinois House,
narrowly defeated in a primary re-election bid by an
abortion-rights candidate after 14 years in office, says she will
sue to be declared the winner.
   The state Board of Elections on April 9 pronounced Rosemary
Mulligan, a paralegal from Des Plaines, the winner over Rep. Penny
Pullen by a vote of 7,431 to 7,400 _ the same count reported on
election night March 20.
   But Pullen said a recount of 56 of the 112 precincts in her
suburban district showed her winning by 17 votes. ``We will be
asking the court to correct the figures and declare me the

   Pullen's attorney, former Chicago Election Commissioner Michael

   Both candidates in the closely watched election had received
financial backing from groups on either side of the abortion issue.

<HEAD>Observer: Cease-Fire Talks On Edge Of Breakdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cease-fire talks involving the Contra
rebels, the Sandinista government and the incoming administration
are on the verge of a breakdown, according to a source close to the
negotiations.
   The parties were optimistically described as being near
agreement on Tuesday, but on Wednesday became bogged down in
disputes. The talks dragged on nine hours with no success reported.
   Suspicion remains high after nine years of civil war.
   The Contras said Wednesday they were willing to negotiate an
immedaite cease-fire. But they said they would not disarm until the
Sandinista-controlled army is under the control of Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro's civilian government, which takes over from President
Daniel Ortega next Wednesday.
   The Sandinistas have warned that a failure by the Contras to
disarm could endanger a peaceful transfer of power.
   An observer from the Organization of American States said late
Wednesday that the talks were ``very delicate and on the edge of
breaking down.'' The observer spoke on condition of anonymity and
gave no further details.
   Chief Contra negotiator Oscar Sovalbarro said earlier that the
rebels want to ``avoid the continued shedding of blood,'' but
expressed distrust for the Sandinista's main objective _ to see the
rebels disarmed before inauguration day.
   He said there were 15,000 rebels in the Nicaraguan countryside;
most estimates put the number at 9,000. The fighters recently began
infiltrating back into Nicaragua from border camps in Honduras,
their base in waging war against the Sandinistas with U.S. support.
   Suspicion on both sides remains high, and the Sandinista Party
newspaper Barricada accused the Contras of playing ``a double game
of promises of demobilization and threats to the contrary.''
   ``They are all working toward the same tactical objective:
gaining time so the demobilization does not start before April 25,
while at the same time ... recently infiltrated troops occupy
advantageous military positions in the mountainous zones,'' it said
in an editorial Wednesday.
   Barricada demanded Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the United
National Opposition, abide by its promise to ``respect the
integrity and professionalism'' of the army in exchange for
officers giving up leadership positions in any political party.
   Sandinista Party officials now control the force.
   On Wednesday evening, about 200 people demanding the immediate
dismantling of the Contras surrounded the Organization of American
States building, where the talks were being held.
   ``We're not leaving ... until they sign to demobilize,'' said a
young woman who gave only her first name, Carla.
   The group threatened representatives of the Contras and Mrs.
Chamorro's advisers, said Antonio Lacayo, head of Mrs. Chamorro's
transition team. No police were present.
   Ortega called on the negotiators ``to contribute patriotically
to reach an accord that sets the exact date for the demobilization
and disarming of the Contras.''
   The Contras' stance increases the chance that Mrs. Chamorro, who
defeated Ortega in Feb. 25 elections, could face a threat of
protest strikes and other actions by Sandinista-dominated labor
groups.
   At a news conference, the Contras said they wanted to clarify a
series of contradictory statements issued since their arrival
Tuesday morning from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa.
   ``We want to be clear that the resistance maintains its
position: As long as the destiny of the Sandinista army is not
known, which cadres are going to control the army of Nicaragua, we
cannot take the next step,'' Aristides Sanchez said.
   The three parties concluded a rough draft of a 12-point document
dealing with the cease-fire and five security zones in which the
Contras are to gather before turning in their weapons.
   ``We have had promises from the president-elect that the
necessary reforms will be made, reforms that can bring the
reconciliation of the Nicaraguan people,'' Sanchez said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Joseph Ada's chief counsel contends in
court papers that the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing
the right to an abortion does not apply to this U.S. territory.
   The memorandum argued that Roe vs. Wade and Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, the July decision giving states more
authority to restrict abortion without overturning the earier
ruling, are not in force in Guam because it is a territory.
   Ada signed the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion measure
into law last month. Enforcement remains on hold pending a hearing
in federal court May 8 on a challenge brought by a woman who wants
an abortion.
   Katherine Maraman, the governor's legal counsel, and attorney
Monessa Lujan argued that many of the Constitution's due process
and equal-protection provisions do not fully apply to Guam in
recognition of its traditions.
   The new law, if upheld by the court, would make it a felony for
doctors to perform abortions and a misdemeanor for women to have
abortions, except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the
mother's life.
   The measure also makes it a misdemeanor to solicit women to have
an abortion.

<HEAD>Study: Many Refuse to Change Sunning Habits After Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of more than 1,000 people who had
skin-cancer surgery found that nearly half continued to stay in the
sun in the belief that cancer ``was not enough of a problem to give
up a tan.''
   Still, a leading dermatologist sees the sun setting on
sunbathing.
   ``I'm encouraged in the way attitudes are changing,'' said Dr.
Howard K. Koh, chairman of the American Academy of Dermatology
committee coordinating its annual effort to encourage skin cancer
prevention and detection.
   ``I think the message is out that the deep tan is unhealthy.''
   The study found 44 percent had not changed their habits
concerning outdoor activities one year after removal of their
cancers, despite a doctor's repeated counseling.
   Thirty-eight percent said they still weren't using sunscreens,
despite their doctors' advice, said the study, published in the
April issue of the American Medical Association's Archives of
Dermatology.
   Though giving up sunbathing was the most common behavior among
subjects after surgery, 24 percent admitted they were still
suntanning a year later.
   ``The attitude of these non-compliant individuals, who were
usually women, was that skin cancer was not enough of a problem to
give up a tan,'' said the study's author, Dr. June K. Robinson, a
dermatologist at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   The patients who disregarded their doctor's advice said a tan
``made them feel good, and that the sunscreens have an
objectionable sticky feeling,'' wrote Ms. Robinson.
   All subjects underwent surgery between 1983 and 1987. They were
counseled before and after by Ms. Robinson and a nurse, who told
them they could reduce their risk for subsequent cancers by
reducing sun exposure, wearing protective clothing and using
sunscreens.
   The study focused on non-melanoma skin cancer because its known
cause is the built-up effect of sun exposure over several years,
Koh said.
   Though rarely fatal, non-melanoma skin cancer will strike an
estimated 600,000 Americans this year, the American Cancer Society
says.
   In contrast, melanoma skin cancer is expected to strike 27,600
Americans in 1990 and kill 5,300.
   Its cause is less certain but is believed to be partly
intermittent harsh sun exposure, particularly during adolescence,
Koh said.
   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United
States, with the number of cases of malignant melanoma doubling
each decade, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   Ms. Robinson wrote that of the 1,042 patients who answered
anonymous questionnaires, 56 percent said they had changed their
outdoor activities.

<BYLINE>China Will Not Tolerate Pro-Democracy Ship
^By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said today it ``cannot tolerate'' support
for a radio ship that plans to transmit pro-democracy messages into
the country, and did not rule out the use of force to stop the
broadcasts.
   ``The activities of this ship are aimed at subverting the
people's government and are against the norms of international
relations,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua told a news
conference.
   ``Therefore we cannot tolerate the support of that ship.''
   The 1,200-ton ``Goddess of Democracy'' left France on March 17
for international waters off the Chinese coast, where it plans to
broadcast music, news and pro-democracy reports to the mainland.
   The converted trawler's mission is sponsored by a coalition of
groups headed by the French magazine Actuel and with the
cooperation of the Federation for a Democratic China, a Paris-based
Chinese dissident organization.
   China has formally protested to the French government about the
boat, and sponsors have charged that the ship has been under
``constant surveillance and intimidation by the Chinese
authorities'' since it left port.
   Actuel on Monday said its editorial offices in Paris were broken
into over the weekend with documents and computer disks related to
the ship stolen. A reporter for the magazine said the disks were
returned on Wednesday in a non-stamped envelope carried to the
magazine's offices by a postman.
   The ``Goddess of Democracy'' is named after the statue erected
by pro-democracy students in Tiananmen Square last spring before
Chinese troops crushed the movement for a freer China, killing
hundreds of people.
   Li refused to answer several questions on whether China would
resort to force to stop the broadcasts, saying only that she had
``nothing to offer'' on that question.
   She said the radio ship ``is a tool of the reactionary
organization Front for Democracy in China (Federation for a
Democratic China) ... We are resolutely opposed to the provision of
support or facilities to it by any state, region, organization or
individual.
   Chinese authorities have protested the mission to France as
``gross interference'' in China's internal affairs. The French
government says it is not involved in the project.
   The ship, which is equipped with one television and two radio
studios, is now in the Indian Ocean headed for Singapore. It plans
to begin broadcasting into the mainland by the end of April.
   Sponsors say the ship suffered 10 days of administrative hassles
in the port of Djibouti on the Horn of Africa.

<HEAD>Air Traffic Control Center Short on Chairs: Union</HEAD>

   Some controllers at the Chicago Air Route Traffic
Control Center are sitting on garbage cans and crates these days
because of a backlog of orders for chair parts, union officials
said.
   The broken chairs threaten the efficiency of the controllers,
who need good chairs to have a clear view of radar screens, said
Jim Poole, chairman of the National Air Traffic Control Association
chapter at the center, 40 miles west of Chicago.
   Union and Federal Aviation Administration officials said the
lack of chairs _ ordinary office chairs designed for good posture _
posed no danger to traffic safety at the center, one of the
nation's busiest with about 400 controllers.
   So many chairs are broken two controllers had to make do with an
overturned garbage can and a wooden box on a recent shift, Poole
said this week.
   FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said there is a nationwide problem
with broken chairs.
   ``The agency has had difficulty getting replacement parts,'' he
said. ``They have to go to Oklahoma City for the parts, and there's
a backlog of orders.''

   The dollar was lower against all key currencies in
European trading this morning, after taking a dive on the Tokyo
market.
   Gold was higher.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from
Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar traded at 156.85 yen.
   The drop in Tokyo was the sharpest since Aug. 1, 1989, when the
dollar fell 2.45 yen overnight.
   Dealers said the dollar began falling in New York Wednesday
despite a report of a sharp improvement in the U.S. merchandise
trade figures for February.
   ``Japanese investors had bought the dollar earlier based on
their expectation that the U.S. trade deficit would largely
improve, and then they dumped the currency when the figure actually
came out,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank in
Tokyo.
   He said the market did not react to Wednesday's U.S. trade
report because it had already taken into account the expected
decline in the trade deficit.
   ``In an attempt to take profits, many market players sold the
dollar regardless of the figure,'' he said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6713 West German marks, down from 1.6720
   _1.4790 Swiss francs, down from 1.4876
   _5.6200 French francs, down from 5.6315
   _1.8835 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8855
   _1,228.00 Italian lire, down from 1,230.50
   _1.1608 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6440, compared with $1.6347
late Wednesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $376.60 per
troy ounce this morning, up from $375.00 per ounce late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $376.50 up from $375.50 late
Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.93 to close at $377.80 an ounce.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Wednesday.

   Three hundred masked men dressed in civilian
clothes rounded up residents of a remote jungle village and shot to
death about 50 elderly people and children, area officials said.
   The massacre occurred one week ago in Sonomoro, according to
officials 12 miles north in Concepcion. They said Wednesday that
they did not learn of it until five survivors arrived on foot to
report it.
   Villagers said they did not know who the attackers were, and
that the gunmen did not say anything during the slaughter.
   The killers could have been members of the Maoist-inspired
Shining Path guerrilla group, said officials in Concepcion, about
120 miles east of Lima, the capital. Both the rebels and government
security forces have been accused of similar massacres in the past.
   The survivors said the attackers, carrying automatic rifles and
grenades, rounded up villagers and shot to death about 50 of them
in the village square after separating them by age.
   They said the killers then burned homes and a school and left on
foot.
   The villagers asked Concepcion officials for police protection
and for money to bury the victims.
   Also Wednesday, police in Peru's main coca-growing region said
Shining Path rebels ambushed an army convoy and killed seven
soldiers.
   An undetermined number of soldiers were wounded in the Tuesday
attack, near the town of Campanilla, 400 miles north of Lima,
police said.
   There was no report of rebel casualties.
   Campanilla is in the upper Huallaga valley, where most of Peru's
coca, the raw material used to make cocaine, is grown. Peru is the
world's leading supplier of coca.
   Shining Path rebels control much of the valley and police say
they allow drug traffickers to operate in the region in exchange
for arms and money.
   The Shining Path has been fighting Peru's elected governments
since 1980.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
violence. Most of the victims have been civilians.

   A Cuban exile is denying federal charges that
he took part 14 years ago in the car-bomb assassination of former
Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier.
   In a three-minute court proceeding Wednesday, Jose Dionisio
Suarez Esquivel pleaded innocent through his lawyer to five felony
charges, including murdering a foreign official.
   FBI agents arrested Suarez on April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla.
He had been a fugitive since his indictment in 1978 with seven
other people in the 1976 bomb blast that killed Letelier as he was
driving along Washington's Embassy Row. A woman aide also was
fatally injured.
   A former Chilean diplomat, Jose Miguel Barros, testified in a
Chilean court last year that Letelier's assassination was ordered
by Chilean army Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who headed
the Chilean National Intelligence Agency.
   Contreras is one of three men sought in the case and U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens said he has not given up hope of having them
brought to justice. The recently replaced military government of
Chile refused to extradite Contreras and another Chilean
intelligence official. A third man, an associate of Suarez, is a
fugitive.
   ``We are currently considering a number of avenues with respect
to the remaining three fugitives,'' Stephens said in a statement.
   Suarez is being held without bond at an undisclosed location. A
plea of innocent was entered for him by his lawyer, Edward Sussman,
before U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson. Suarez's next court
appearance will be in two or three weeks.
   Investigators believe that Suarez, reportedly a member of an
anti-Castro group, was drawn into the murder by officials of Chile.
Letelier had been ambassador to the United States from 1970 to 1973
under the Marxist government of Salvador Allende. His killing
strained U.S. relations with the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
   According to the indictment, Suarez provided explosives and a
remote-controlled detonating device and helped assemble the bomb
used in the assassination.
   Michael Townley, a U.S. citizen who worked for the Chilean
intelligence agency and served a prison term in the case, said
Suarez detonated the bomb.
   FBI officials said Suarez, 51, a naturalized U.S. citizen, had
been living in the St. Petersburg area for the past five years and
the arrest was the result of information developed a few days
before his capture.

   Attorney General Yosef Harish today ordered
police to remove 150 Jewish settlers from a building complex in the
Christian quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
   The Jews' occupation of a 72-room building complex in the
Christian area on April 11 set off a week of angry protests by
Christian clerics and Palestinians, both Christian and Moslem.
   About 30 police and border guards were stationed outside the
four 100-year-old buildings owned by the Greek Orthodox Church just
after the order was issued.
   Asked if the settlers would be ejected today, Police spokesman
Uzi Sandori said: ``It's almost certain but not sure.''
   Ben Elon, one settler, said the group had not yet received
Harish's eviction order. Asked if they would comply with the order,
Elon said: ``We will honor all legal decisions.''
   Harish's order said the settlers have not proved the right to
occupy the complex. He said he took the action to prevent further
deterioration of relations between the Christian and Jewish
communities in Jerusalem.
   If the Jews are removed from the building, it would be the first
time settlers have been dislodged since April 1982 when Israeli
soldiers evacuated 3,000 settlers from Yamit in the Sinai
Peninsula, ceded to Egypt under its peace treaty with Israel.
   Abdul Wahab Daroushe, an Arab member of Israel's Parliament,
visited the Jerusalem site and told the settlers the Jews should
leave.
   ``I don't think there are any lack of apartments for these
people to live in. They are a provocation here,'' he said.
   The Jews' move into the Christian quarter upset a tradition in
which religious communities in the Old City live in separate and
jealously guarded neighborhoods.
   The settlement also has political implications since the Old
City is part of the area captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war. Israel annexed the area to its capital, but most
countries, including the United States, do not recognize Israel's
claim to sovereignty.
   The settlement led to court action by the Greek Orthodox Church
to dislodge the settlers.
   The church maintained a former tenant acted illegally when he
sold his rights to live in the building, leading to establishment
of the Jewish settlement. The settlers argued they had a legal
contract from a Panamanian company to sublet.

   The Bush administration, responding to a
lessening of tensions in Europe, is indefinitely postponing the
production of new short-range nuclear missiles that were to be
deployed in West Germany, U.S. officials said today.
   The 88 new launchers, 36 of which were to be controlled by the
United States and the others by West Germany, Britain and the
Netherlands, were designed for targeting on East Germany.
   The tentative U.S. goal was to begin deploying them in 1995 to
replace the current mixture of nuclear-armed and conventional Lance
missiles.
   But East Germany is rapidly moving out of the Soviet sphere and
preparing for union with West Germany. It is no longer perceived as
a threat to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.
   The current arsenal of Lances will remain in West Germany,
however. Those with nuclear warheads have a range of about 75
miles, and the non-nuclear weapons are designed to hit targets
within 45 miles.
   The new launchers were intended to have a greater range of about
280 miles, just below the level of intermediate-range nuclear
missiles that were banned in a U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987.
   ``The present system is a viable deterrent through the year
2,000, even though the Army would have liked to start deployment of
new Lances in 1995,'' a U.S. official said.
   The current Lances recently were touched up with new fuel for
their rockets, the replacement of worn-out components and other
maintenance.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marla Maples says she went into hiding amid the
publicity about her reported romance with Donald Trump in part out
of concern for her friends' privacy.
   ``I didn't want to bring any more havoc into my friend's
lives,'' Maples said in an interview with ABC newswoman Diane
Sawyer. ``I had to always think about where I was going and what
effect it could have on the people I was visiting.''
   Sawyer showed a brief clip of the taped interview this morning
on the WABC-TV program ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' The
interview was to be broadcast tonight on ABC's ``Primetime Live.''
   Allegations of the actress-model's purported affair with Trump
first surfaced in February.
   After she was thrust into the spotlight, Maples said, ``I knew I
had to get away. I knew I needed to turn off the television, not
read newspapers, just not be affected by words. I needed to get
back to what's real.''
   Sawyer said Maples avoided talking about specifics in her
relationship with Trump, about which she may have to testify in
litigation between the developer and his wife, Ivana.

<HEAD>Report: FTC Investigating On-Screen Advertising Bans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Hollywood studios that banned on-screen
advertisements at theaters showing their movies have come under
investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, according to
published reports.
   Fred Haynes, chief of the FTC antitrust division's motion
picture section, revealed the probe of Walt Disney Studios and
Warner Bros. at a recent board meeting of the National Association
of Theater Owners in Washington, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
   The FTC would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the
investigation first reported Wednesday in the entertainment trade
paper Daily Variety, the Times said.
   Justice Department spokesman Joe Krovinsky said Wednesday that
officials there were aware of the FTC probe because the agencies
check with each other to avoid duplicating efforts.
   Officials with Disney and Warner said the studios had not been
contacted by the FTC and they would not comment on the reports, the
Times said.
   Disney and Warner have said many moviegoers dislike the
commercials and the studios feared the bad feelings could extend to
their feature films.
   Some theater owners have said the policy infringes on their
right to offset costs by showing commercials before movies.
   The FTC enforces laws governing restraint of trade, which is the
restriction or prevention of business competition.
   Both Disney and Warner have said they will allow theaters'
existing advertising contracts to expire before they impose the
bans.

<HEAD>Elderly Minister Arrested in Death of Ill Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 81-year-old retired minister was
charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the
clubbing death of his ailing daughter.
   The Rev. Gerald E. Maggart struck 49-year-old Beverly Maggart
with a hammer Tuesday night as she lay in a bed in her apartment,
authorities said. She lived within a short walk of her parents.
   Maggart, the retired pastor of Country Club Congregational
Church, was charged Wednesday and released on $25,000 bond.
   His wife, Elizabeth Maggart, said he acted out of kindness, not
malice. She said their daughter suffered from a brain tumor,
seizures and bad reactions to medication, though her problems were
not terminal.
   ``The poor girl was going through so much,'' Mrs. Maggart said.
``They just loved each other to death.''
   Police said Maggart decided to kill his daughter on Sunday. He
allegedly walked to her apartment Tuesday and killed her about 11
p.m. He called police Wednesday morning after talking to his wife.
   John M. Morris, chief counsel for the criminal division of the
state attorney general's office, said he does not recall any
previous mercy killing cases in Missouri. The state has no
provision for mercy killing, he said, adding, ``Murder is murder.''
   Beverly Maggart worked as a secretary at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City from the mid-1970s until she became physically
unable to work last September.

   All the new Lances were supposed to be nuclear-armed.
   Their potential deployment had stirred opposition among West
German groups eager to promote disarmament and concerned that
deploying new weapons on their territory could make West Germany a
more inviting target in the event of a war.
   As East-West tensions eased, support for the missiles declined
in the West German government and among several of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
   Still, the Reagan and Bush administrations resisted efforts led
by West Germany for negotiations to eliminate both NATO and Warsaw
Pact short-range missiles until a treaty to cut back troops, tanks
and other weapons in Europe is concluded.
   The accord is still not finished. But, the officials said, the
Bush administration has decided not to have the Army Missile
Command solicit proposals from munitions makers for manufacturing
new Lance missiles.
   ``The project has been put on indefinite hold,'' said a U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the current Lance arsenal would serve as a deterrent
through the rest of the century.

<HEAD>Income Growth Slowed in New England for Second Straight Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Per capita personal income growth slowed in
New England for the second straight year in l989 and failed to
match the national average in the Plains, Southwest and Far West
states, the government said today.
   ``New England had a second consecutive year of decelerating per
capita income growth in 1989,'' the Commerce Department said in its
semi-annual report. ``Per capita income in New England grew 6.6
percent in 1989, down from 8.3 percent in 1988 and 8.6 percent in
1987.''
   Despite the slowdown, New England's per capita income of $21,509
topped all other regions of the country, according to the survey by
the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
   By contrast, per capita incomes grew 5.5 percent to $16,231 in
the Plains, 5.6 percent to $19,153 in the Far West and 6.1 percent
to $15,231 in the Southwest, the department said.
   It reported the national growth rate was 6.5 percent and the
average per capita personal income was $17,567.
   The Mideast posted the highest growth rate, up 7.1 percent. It
was followed by the Great Lakes region, up 7.0 percent; and the
Southeast and Rocky Mountain states, both up 6.7 percent.
   It was the third consecutive year of accelerating growth in the
Rocky Mountains. But despite the pickup, it still was 13 percent
below the U.S. average of $17,567.
   Per capita personal income is the annual total personal income
of residents divided by the resident population.
   States with the highest incomes were Connecticut, with an
average $24,604; New Jersey, $23,764; Massachusetts, $22,196;
Alaska, $21,173, and Maryland, $21,020.
   At the lowest end were Mississippi with an average $11,835; West
Virginia, $12,529; Arkansas, $12,984; Utah, $13,027, and Louisiana,
$13,041.
   New England posted ``well-above-average growth earlier in the
1980s,'' the department said. The deceleration last year was caused
by the smallest earnings increases in manufacturing and private
service-type industries since 1975 and the first construction
earnings decline since 1975.

   Area code 212's number is up. And that means
New York could have three area codes in a few years.
   With the proliferation of faxes and computers using phone lines,
New York Telephone expects to run out of numbers for that area code
in Manhattan and the Bronx in 1993, company spokesman Peter Muller
said.
   Muller said the company's ``best guess'' is that it will add an
area code that year. New York Telephone has reserved 917 for future
use.
   The state Public Service Commission voted Wednesday to begin
looking at the issue and to solicit comments.
   One option would be to assign the new area code to cellular and
pager numbers, said commission spokesman Edward Collins. No area in
the country has a special area code for portable phones and
beepers, he said.
   The five boroughs that make up New York City used to have one
area code: 212. In 1985 the numbers in that area code were used up,
and the 718 area code was created for Brooklyn, Staten Island and
Queens.
   New York and Los Angeles are the nation's only two cities with
two area codes. Los Angeles County is getting a third area code in
1992 that Pacific Bell says will include parts of the city.

<HEAD>Gap Between Federal Income Taxes Owed and Paid About $100 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gap between federal income taxes owed and
paid is about $100 billion a year and growing, and Internal Revenue
Service enforcement efforts are likely to cut it by only about
one-fourth, Congress was told today.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. said the tax gap was as
much as $96.8 billion in 1988 and predicted it will rise to $127
billion in 1992. The figure includes only the federal income taxes
owed on legal income. The total gap, including taxes on illegal
earnings, and Social Security and estate taxes, has been estimated
unofficially at $200 billion a year or more.
   The tax gap does not include about $87 billion of accounts
receivable, which are taxes assessed by the IRS but still unpaid
over several years.
   ``A $100 billion shortfall is certainly a cause for concern _
particularly in today's world of sizable deficits,'' Goldberg told
the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. He noted, however,
that last year the IRS collected over $1 trillion, all but $25
billion of it paid through self-assessment by the taxpayers.
   ``The plain fact is that voluntary compliance has been and
remains the backbone of our tax system,'' Goldberg said. Although
tougher enforcement efforts are essential, he added, ``we cannot
lose sight of the fact that a 1 percent swing in voluntary
compliance will increase _ or decrease _ revenues each year by more
than $5 billion.''
   His prescription for the problem: simplified tax laws, a
modernized computer system and better quality assistance to
taxpayers. ``Taxpayers are willing to pay what they owe; they
cannot abide complexity, uncertainty, administrative burdens and
hassles with the IRS that may take months or years to resolve,''
Goldberg said.
   Since the IRS began tracking the tax gap, voluntary compliance
by individual taxpayers has remained fairly constanty: as high as
83 percent in 1973, 82.7 percent in 1988 and a forecast of 83.6
percent in 1992. Corporate compliance, estimated at 86.6 percent in
1973, has risen to 88.1 percent.
   In 1987, the lastest year for which complete figures are
available, 25.8 percent of the tax gap was attributed to informal
supplies (such as roadside vendors and home-repair workers)
underreporting income; large corporations were next at 17.8 percent.
   Individuals who did not bother to file a return accounted for
7.6 percent of the gap. Failure to report capital gains was
responsible for 7.1 percent. Miscellaneous business income,
including rent and partnership income, accounted for 6.7 percent.
   The IRS found that 99 percent of wages, interest and dividends
was reported. The remainder accounted for 4.6 percent of the gap.
   Goldberg estimated that $505 billion of income taxes were due in
1987 and that $411 billion was paid voluntarily, leaving a gross
tax gap of $94 billion. IRS enforcement efforts, including audits
and collection initiatives, brought in $22 billion, leaving a net
gap of $72 billion.

<HEAD>Jogger A Year After Attack: Promoted To VP And May Testify At
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Park jogger who was gang-raped and
beaten into a coma a year ago today has been promoted to a vice
president at her investment banking firm, Salomon Brothers Inc.
   The promotion was confirmed today by Lisa Borowitz, a Salomon
spokeswoman. It was made in January, when the firm announces all
its corporate moves.
   The 29-year-old jogger, whose name has never been made public,
returned to work at Salomon Brothers in November after undergoing
rehabilitation at a Connecticut hospital. She was assigned to a
position advising large corporations on investments.
   Doctors have called her recovery from severe brain damage
remarkable. When she was found in the park April 20, 1989, after
being attacked the previous evening, she had lost most of her blood
and was near death.
   The woman may be called to testify against her alleged
assailants, even though she has no memory of the attack.
   New York Newsday, quoting unidentified court sources, reported
there is a ``strong possibility'' prosecutors will call her to the
witness stand to discuss her life before the attack and her
recovery. She has said she wants to testify.
   No date has been set for the first trial, which will involve
three of the six teen-agers charged.
   Authorities said she was attacked while jogging during the late
evening, as she often did, by a gang of ``wilding'' youths who beat
and raped her and left her.
   Two suspects remain in jail because they could not make bail:
Raymond Santana, 15, and Kharey Wise, 17.
   The other four suspects, Kevin Richardson, 15; Steven Lopez, 16;
Antron McCray, 16; and Yusef Salaam, 16, are out on bail. Salaam,
Santana and McCray are to be tried first.

   Three Soviet diplomats accredited with the United
Nations have been uncovered as spies attempting to obtain
restricted technology, Swiss authorities said today.
   The three were trying to collect confidential
``scientific-technological information,'' according to the office
of the Federal Prosecutor at Bern. They were accredited with the
U.N. office in Geneva.
   One was stopped last month on a parking lot in Geneva before he
was to receive documents from an informant, the office said. He has
since left Switzerland, it added. The government demanded last week
that he be recalled.
   The two others returned home earlier as part of a regular
rotation, the office said. All three were barred from re-entering
Swiss territory.
   A spokesman of the office, Roland Hauenstein, declined to give
their names or elaborate on their assignments. He also refused to
say what happened to the informant.
   Hauenstein said the case showed again that Eastern intelligence
agents are focusing on efforts to obtain Western technological and
scientific know-how. Last year, a member of the Soviet trade
mission in Bern was expelled for similar activities.
   The Geneva newspaper Tribune de Geneve said about 1,200 Soviet
officials in Geneva and 120 in Bern and Zurich have diplomatic
status. It said about 30 percent were believed to be intelligence
agents.

   A package bomb believed sent by Basque
separatists exploded today at the headquarters of Expo '92, the
Seville World's Fair, injuring one woman, officials said.
   A spokesman at Seville's General Hospital said the left hand of
secretary Carmen de Felipe was mangled when she opened a book sent
inside the package. Surgeons were operating in an attempt to save
her hand, he said.
   The explosion, at around noon, was the first attack directly
related to the exposition, scheduled to open April 12, 1992, in
commemoration of Christopher Columbus' first voyage to the New
World.
   At the time of the explosion, Expo '92 Commissioner Manuel
Olivencia was meeting with officials of the French-based
International Expositions Office.
   None of the participants in the meeting was injured.
   No group immediately took reponsibility for the blast. Police
said the package bore the hallmarks of ETA, the Basque separatist
group that has been attacking official Spanish targets in its
independence campaign for the three-province Basque region.
   On April 2, police at a roadblock outside Seville arrested a
French national whose car contained more than 660 pounds of
explosives.
   The man, Henri Parot, said he belonged to a roving French
commando group of ETA. He said the organization had planned car
bomb attacks against government buildings in the southern Spanish
city.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed the lives of more than 600 people since 1968.

<TEXT>
   Nepal's first independent government in
almost three decades took office today, less than two weeks after
the king lifted a ban on political parties.
   King Birendra swore in Nepali Congress Party President Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai, a former political prisoner, as prime minister
and leader of an interim coalition government until elections
promised for within a year.
   After taking the oath of office at the royal palace in central
Katmandu, Bhattarai swore in nine ministers at the government
secretariat. One member of the 11-minister Cabinet was to arrive in
the capital later, Bhattarai said.
   Four ministers including Bhattarai belong to the Nepali
Congress, three to the United Left Front, two are Birendra's
nominees and two are independents.
   ``The responsibility weighs very heavy on my shoulders,''
Bhattarai said after the swearing-in ceremony. Hundreds of people
packed the conference hall where the ministers took their oaths in
a private ceremony.
   Bhattarai said his government's first priority will be to ``try
to lessen the economic difficulties of the people and make life
easier and less expensive than what it is today.''
   Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Its 17 million
people have an average annual income of 150 dollars a year, and 75
percent of them are illiterate.
   Nepali Congress leader Ganesh Man Singh, who declined Birendra's
proposal to become prime minister because of poor health, said
economic reforms were important but ``cannot be achieved in a day
and people should not have unwarranted aspirations.''
   The swearing-in capped the pro-democracy movement that started
Feb. 18 with a series of marches and strikes that spawned a popular
groundswell in this remote Himalayan monarchy where political
activity had been forbidden since 1961.
   On April 6, police opened fire on 200,000 demonstrators marching
on Birendra's palace, killing 200, according to witnesses. The
government claims no more than 10 died.
   Two days later the king yielded to the mass movement led by the
Nepali Congress and the United Left Front, and lifted a 29-year ban
on political parties.
   On April 16, Birendra dissolved the partyless legislature and
announced the resignation of his government's prime minister,
Lokendra Bahadur Chand.
   Those had been the main conditions of the Nepali Congress and
the United Left Front for joining a palace-proposed interim
government.
   The ministers' oath called for allegiance to Nepal's present
constitution which gives near-absolute powers to the king.
   But Bhattarai has said a proposed constitutional reforms
commission would draft a new constitution reducing the king's
powers and possibly make Nepal a constitutional monarchy.
   The new government has also promised to hold multiparty
elections within a year.
   The Nepali Congress formed the country's first democratically
elected government in 1959, but it lasted only 20 months before
Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed it, accusing it of
corruption and poor administration.
   Bhattarai was Parliament speaker in the 1959-60 government. He
was jailed for nine years immediately after Mahendra dissolved that
government and spent five more years in jail at different times for
political agitation.

   Officers killed four blacks
today, just hours after President F.W. de Klerk ordered an
investigation into the police shooting of 11 unarmed blacks who
were protesting high rents.
   Police said officers shot and killed four youths and wounded
another at the Rammulotsi black township near Viljoenskroon in the
Orange Free State. Police opened fire during a demonstration, but
officials declined to give any details.
   Earlier, De Klerk appointed a judicial commission to investigate
the March 26 police action in the black township of Sebokeng. The
African National Congress had pulled out of peace talks with the
government over the killings. Judge Richard Goldstone will head the
inquiry, the government said.
   In other developments, police said five more people died in
black factional fighting in Natal province, including a black
police officer who was stabbed. They said a 14-year-old boy and a
9-year-old girl were burned to death in ``necklace'' killings.
Blazing tires were put around their necks.
   Police said a police barracks in the black township of Soweto
outside Johannesburg was attacked Wednesday with grenades, but
there were no injuries.
   The government also announced that military reservists would be
required to do 60 days duty a year instead of 30 days because of
growing unrest.
   De Klerk made the decision to appoint a judicial commission to
look into the police action in Sebokeng, which is outside
Johannesburg, after meeting late Wednesday with his Cabinet. Judge
Richard Goldstone will head the inquiry.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu welcomed de Klerk's decision, saying
police actions must be investigated.
   ``A judicial commission is important in our situation because it
is able more or less to sift through things _ not depend on
opinions,'' he said.
   Police said they were forced to open fire when protesters
threatened officers blocking the march.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan said military service for army
reservists had to be increased to 60 days because of unrest in
Natal and other parts of the country.
   ``This situation, as well as the potential for unrest elsewhere
in the country, make an extension of the service period ...
unavoidable as a temporary measure,'' he said in a statement.
   Malan challenged the ANC to drop its support for armed
resistance to the white government. He said all responsible groups
had to help end the wave of unrest that has claimed more than 500
lives this year.
   ``No peace process can in reality take place if violence
continues or when violence is held out as an option,'' he said.
   ``Revolutionary intimidation and mobilization of people is
taking place on a wide scale and is connected with the ANC's links
to the continuation of the armed struggle.''
   De Klerk earlier this week demanded the ANC formally renounce
its armed struggle. The ANC has refused to renounce violence, even
though its guerrilla forces are virtually inactive.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and freed Nelson Mandela in February
to try and clear the way for talks on ending white-minority rule
and sharing power with the country's black majority.
   Much of the violence sweeping South Africa has involved rival
black political factions. The worst bloodshed has been in Natal,
where hundreds have died in black faction fights.

   The Sandinista government and the
U.S.-backed rebels signed a cease-fire agreement early today that
calls on the Contras to begin laying down their arms next week and
to disband by June 10.
   The cease-fire, which began at noon today, will be verified by
U.N. forces and Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   The document was signed by Nicaragua's minister of defense, Gen.
Humberto Ortega, rebel commanders Oscar Sovalbarro and Aquilino
Ruiz Robleto, and representatives of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   ``With this accord we conclude the peace process started with
the elections,'' said Antonio Lacayo, chief of the Chamorro
transition team.
   The Yatama Miskito Indian group fighting alongside the Contras
on the Atlantic coast reached a separate but similar disarmament
agreement that establishes a cease-fire in the eastern half of the
country at midnight today.
   The accords appeared to end a tense standoff among the
Sandinista government, Chamorro's incoming administration and the
Contras that had threatened to derail the transfer of power in
Nicaragua.
   The signing came after lengthy negotiations, including an
all-night session that ended this morning. The talks began on
Tuesday.
   The agreement says the rebel forces should begin disarming on
Wednesday, the day the Chamorro government is inaugurated.
Demobilization of the Contra forces is to be completed by June 10
at the latest.
   The leftist Sandinistas had demanded that the Contras disarm
before they handed power to the new civilian government. But Gen.
Ortega said today that it was more important that peace be reached
``as soon as possible.''
   ``We all made an effort so that it (the dismantling) would have
been on the 25th,'' but ``technical hurdles'' made that impossible,
Gen. Ortega said.
   He said the delay was ``nothing if we compare it to the tragedy
and suffering that we have had during these years of war.''
   The accord says the Contras' weapons will be surrendered ``in a
voluntary form'' in the presence of U.N. forces and Obando y Bravo.
   It also establishes security zones for the rebels inside
Nicaragua so they can begin regrouping immediately in preparation
for demobilization and disarmament. During the decade-long war
between the Contras and the Sandinista government, many of the
Contras were based in Honduras.
   Under the accord signed today, Sandinista forces are to start
withdrawing immmediately from the five security zones and complete
the withdrawal by Saturday. The Sandinista forces are required to
stay at least 12 miles from the zones and are prohibited from
conducting flights over the zones.
   The government has guaranteed the safety of the rebels and their
families and said it will respect their civil liberties.
   The agreement calls for Roman Catholic monitors to provide
transportation for the rebels and their families to the security
zones and give them humanitarian aid.
   The Contras had said on Wednesday they were willing to negotiate
an immediate cease-fire but would not disarm until the
Sandinista-controlled army was brought under the control of the new
civilian government.
   Sandinista President Daniel Ortega had warned that if the
Contras failed to disarm, the peaceful transfer of power could be
endangered.
   There are at least 9,000 rebels in the Nicaraguan countryside.
The fighters recently began returning to Nicaragua from border
camps in Honduras.
   The talks began on Tuesday, lasted for six hours and then
resumed again on Wednesday afternoon, lasting until about 5:30 this
morning.
   The negotiations were the first involving the opposition
coalition backing Chamorro, known as UNO, the Contras and the
Sandinistas since Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition defeated the
Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro will take office for six years and her
administration is counting on a peaceful Nicaragua to deliver on
her key campaign promise of reviving the economy.
   Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro had called on the Contras to disband.
   However, as soon as UNO won the elections, most of the Contras
slipped across the border into Nicaragua, leaving behind in
Honduras only the wounded, the crippled and a few old guns.
   That reduced the effectiveness of a UNO-Contra accord of March
23 under which Contra forces in Honduras were to disarm. The accord
set no firm date.
   Washington backed the Contras in their nine-year war with the
Sandinistas that cost 57,000 lives but supported Mrs. Chamorro's
call for their dissolution. Fighting between the Contras and
Sandinista forces had slowed to a virtual standstill in recent
months, with only sporadic fighting.

<HEAD>Attorney General Describes Spokesman's Role in Gray Story</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today
confirmed that his chief spokesman had declined to steer a CBS
reporter off a story about a criminal investigation involving Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   Thornburgh, who ordered an intensive criminal investigation of
unauthorized disclosures about the case, said in a statement that
press secretary David Runkel was following his standing
instructions by declining to wave CBS reporter Rita Braver off the
story.
   Thornburgh said Runkel did not violate any department rules
because he had not intended to confirm the story by refusing to
deny information Ms. Braver had obtained from other sources.
   Several days after CBS reported that Gray was a subject of the
probe, the Justice Department issued a statement that the
congressman was not a target of the investigation.
   The department said at the time that Gray was cooperating with
the investigation of alleged financial irregularities in his
congressional office.
   Thornburgh said that Runkel, in refusing to deny that a probe of
Gray was underway, was ``following my standing instruction that no
one in the department mislead the media.''
   ``Unfortunately, there are circumstances where a statement of
the kind likely made here by Mr. Runkel may be used by a reporter
as confirmation of a story,'' the attorney general said.
   The attorney general, who was attending a hemispheric drug
enforcement conference in Mexico, issued the statement in response
to a story in today's editions of The New York Times that Runkel
had played a role in confirming the story reported by Ms. Braver
last spring.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian, who read the
attorney general's statement to reporters, refused to comment on
The Times' account that Runkel had failed a lie detector test
during the leak investigation conducted by federal prosecutors and
the FBI.
   Thornburgh said that ``a refusal to deny or wave a reporter off
a story with which he is confronted by the reporter does not, in my
view, constitute misconduct.'
   ``A real distinction must be made, I believe, between an
unsolicited and affirmative unauthorized disclosure and such a
`confirmation' by one responsible for dealing with the media.''
   The CBS story produced a storm of indignation from Democrats on
Capitol Hill because it broke as Gray was seeking election as House
majority whip.
   Democrats charged the leaks from the Justice Department were
politically inspired.
   Thornburgh ordered the Justice Department to conduct a criminal
investigation, in which more than 100 people were questioned and
asked to make sworn statements.
   Runkel has refused to say if he was among those who took lie
detector tests but has confirmed that he had given testimony before
a federal grand jury that investigated the matter.
   In December, Thornburgh reported to Congress that the
investigation ``has not produced sufficient evidence to enable me
to ascertain that any present employee of the Department of Justice
was responsible for the disclosure.''
   The attorney general, responding to pressure from Democratic
lawmakers, agreed recently to turn over the report of the
investigation to the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility.
   That unit conducts investigations of misconduct by Justice
Department employees and can recommend to the attorney general that
disciplinary action be taken against individuals.
   Eramian said ``the OPR review has been completed and the
attorney general has received that office's advice.'' He declined
to say what OPR had advised.

   President Bush met with French President
Francois Mitterrand at a Florida Keys resort today to discuss the
future of NATO and how to respond to Soviet pressure on the
breakaway republic of Lithuania.
   ``We're still trying to get verification of the exact situation
there,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the
developing Lithuanian crisis as Bush flew to the Florida Keys for
his meeting with Mitterrand.
   The Kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural gas to
Lithuania today, hours after it halted the flow of crude oil to the
republic for refusing to scrap laws promoting independence,
Lithuanian officials said.
   ``President Bush has begun a series of consultations with our
allies on appropriate responses,'' Fitzwater said. ``He telephoned
German Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl yesterday on this matter. He will
discuss it with President Mitterrand this afternoon and we will be
in touch with all of the allies either directly or through
diplomatic channels in the next few days.''
   Asked if joint NATO or Western action was being considered,
Fitzwater said, ``I wouldn't put it in that category. I think it's
more a consultation about what individual countries might do, what
their approach might be.''
   ``We're still trying to get dialogue. Trying to get both sides
to use whatever maneuvering room they have,'' said Fitzwater.
   The spokesman also said the U.S. government had received a
message from Syria Wednesday saying it appears an American hostage
would be released as the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine said earlier.
   ``We have statements of imminent release from Islamic Jihad and
from Syria. But there's no way for us to know conclusively that
it's going to happen,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the State Department has dispatched a reception team to
Wiesbaden, West Germany, but cautioned that the reception team has
been sent there before on rumors of a hostage release that never
happened.
   ``Our position is that we want the unconditional release of all
hostages. We will not deal or negotiate for hostage release but
we're hopeful this could be real,'' Fitzwater said.
   Today's meeting of Bush and Mitterrand is the seventh time the
two leaders have met since Bush became president 15 months ago.
   After flying across the Atlantic in a Concorde jet, the French
leader joined Bush at the exclusive Ocean Reef Club. The two
leaders went to the private waterfront estate of Ohio businessman
and friend Richard Farmer to begin eight hours of talks.
   Heading into the meeting, Bush waved off reporters questions
about Lithuania, saying ``We'll answer all questions later.''
   The president said earlier he hoped the session with Mitterrand
will ``narrow any differences that might exist'' between France and
the United States on the post-Cold War role of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the West's political and military alliance.
   ``There have been reports that there was a little drift and a
little separation'' between the two allies on the future of NATO,
Bush said in an interview Monday. ``The best way to find that out
is simply to sit and talk.''
   Fitzwater said that in addition to NATO and German unification,
Bush and Mitterrand will discuss the May 30 U.S.-Soviet summit as
well as the president's recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Bush, who met last week with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney in Toronto and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
Bermuda, said, ``I've tried hard as president to stay in close
touch with our alliance leaders, and (these) talks, given the
rapidity of change in Eastern Europe, seemed very timely.''
   France has enjoyed a special, independent status within NATO
ever since the late Charles de Gaulle pulled French forces out of
the alliance's integrated military structure in 1966. De Gaulle was
unwilling to cede control of French forces to NATO's supreme
commander _ an American general.
   Now, as the two Germanys head toward unification, Bush and the
entire NATO alliance have insisted that the new Germany must be a
full member of NATO, including its military arm. The Soviet Union
has dropped its insistence that Germany be neutralized, but has
suggested overlapping NATO and Warsaw Pact membership.
   Mitterrand planned to fly back to Paris aboard the supersonic
jet tonight after eight hours of private meetings, a news
conference and dinner with his American host.
   For Bush, it was the prelude to an outdoorsy Earth Day weekend
that he will spend fishing in the Everglades off Islamorada, Fla.,
after side trips to Republican fundraisers in Birmingham, Ala., and
Orlando, Fla., on Friday.

<HEAD>Denver Mayor Orders Probe Into Coroner's Office After Autopsies
Disputed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Federico Pena has ordered an investigation
into the Denver coroner's office following questions about its
handling of the deaths of two small children.
   Pena on Wednesday asked the Denver Department of Health and
Hospitals to conduct a thorough review. He said he specifically
wants an analysis of the working relationship between the coroner's
office, the district attorney's office, the police department and
other city agencies.
   Attorneys and medical experts have questioned the competence of
a pathologist, Dr. Robert Deters, who was temporarily hired by the
coroner's office during a staff shortage. The offices of the
Colorado public defender and the Denver district attorney
separately have requested second opinions on Deters' rulings in the
deaths of two children.
   The district attorney is questioning the case of 16-month-old
Salvador Rodriguez of Denver, who was hospitalized Jan. 17 and died
three days later. Several doctors at the hospital said he showed
signs of having been hit on the ear, but Deters ruled that the
child had died of complications resulting from an ear infection.
   In another case, involving a 2-month-old boy allegedly starved
to death by his mother, the public defender's office accused the
coroner's office of withholding autopsy reports and failing to
perform required tests.
   Questions also have been raised about Deters' findings in other
cases.
   Deters on Wednesday said his work had remained top-quality
despite a caseload of more than 500 autopsies in 16 months.
   ``I worked hard, I put in some long hours and I devoted whatever
time was required to the job thoroughly,'' he said.
   John Fairman, manager of the Denver health department, said the
coroner's office turned to Deters, head of the pathology department
at McKee Medical Center in Loveland, for a few months' help after
its full-time pathologist resigned and the part-time pathologist
was transferred.
   But the contract period grew to 10 months, during which time
Deters performed 390 autopsies for Denver, plus others for McKee
and for counties in northern Colorado and Wyoming. Deters says he
has worked as much as 80 hours a week during the past 10 months,
with few days off.
   He was paid $234,000 for the autopsies performed for Denver.
   At a news conference at Denver General Hospital Wednesday,
Deters initially declined to discuss the cases in which his rulings
have been challenged because of possible litigation.
   But he later stood by his decision in the Rodriguez case.
   Also at the news conference, officials with the Denver
Department of Health and Hospitals, the coroner's office and McKee
defended Deters' work.
   ``He stepped forward voluntarily and has worked extremely hard
to provide competent, high-quality work,'' said Dr. Ben Galloway,
acting director of forensic pathology at the Denver coroner's
office.
   Denver this month hired a new full-time pathologist, which is
expected to ease the crisis in the coroner's office. Fairman said
Deters remains on contract, but can now reduce his workload.

   The 1990 census could cost an extra $100
million or more, Census Director Barbara E. Bryant said today as
she urged Americans who have not returned their forms to do so.
   It could cost the bureau an extra $10 million to count each 1
percent of citizens who don't mail back their forms, she told the
House census subcommittee. Currently the response rate is 7 percent
below plan.
   Asked if the total shortfall would be close to $100 million,
Bryant said, ``it could be more than that.''
   Some 4.8 million census forms have been returned by the post
office as undeliverable. Detailed plans exist to send workers out
to count people on their doorsteps.
   ``We plan to follow up on every housing unit for which a
questionnaire was not returned and we have the workforce to do
it,'' she said.
   The census is not over, Bryant emphasized, calling on Americans
to mail back their forms. Workers will begin visitimg homes next
week, but the bureau is always happy to get mailed-back forms, she
said.
   Currently, 63 percent of households have mailed back their
census forme, she said. The bureau had hoped for a 70 percent mail
response.
   Census workers have been hand-delivering forms to many of the
missed blocks and buildings, a process that has delayed response in
many areas. Thus, the bureau continues to urge people to fill out
the forms and send them back although the count officially took
place on April 1.
   The updated figures show Wisconsin as the most responsive state,
with 74.5 percent of households having sent back their forms.
Alaska is trailing at 47.1 percent.
   Among major cities, Columbus, Ohio was leading with a 71.9
percent response rate.
   Other major cities with high return rates included Indianapolis,
68.6 percent; Minneapolis-St. Paul, 66.2 percent; El Paso, 64.9
percent; Kansas City, 64.4 percent and Seattle, 64.2 percent.
   Boston was last at 45.4 percent and New Orleans was also low at
47 percent.
   Other major city response rates include Atlanta, 60 percent;
Baltimore, 60.9; Chicago, 52.0; Cleveland, 50.8; Dallas, 58;
Denver, 59.3; Detroit, 55.3; Houston, 55.6;
   Also Los Angeles, 58.3 percent; Memphis, 60.2; Milwaukee, 59.8;
New York, 51.3; Philadelphia, 54.7; San Diego, 60.8; and San
Francisco, 61.7.

   A summer storm whipped across
Bangladesh, killing eight people and injuring 200, news reports and
officials said Thursday.
   The storm, with winds of 60 to 90 mph, hit six eastern and
northern districts Wednesday. It blew down houses and toppled
trees, said a district official at Jamalpur, 90 miles northwest of
Dhaka. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, is often
buffeted by natural disasters. Floods, cyclones and storms kill
hundreds of people every year.
   At least 166 people were killed and another 1,600 injured in
storms that battered the country in late March and early April.

   The government Thursday filed
rebellion and murder charges against one of President Corazon
Aquino's sharpest critics for allegedly helping mutineers in last
December's coup bid, officials said.
   Judge Tirso Salazar's spokeswoman said the court ordered the
arrest of Homobono Adaza, former member of the Philippine Assembly,
and five other people for their alleged involvement in the Dec. 1-9
bid to oust Mrs. Aquino.
   Adaza's lawyer, Armando Marcelo, said he was told about the
charges but was unaware of any arrest warrant. He said he did not
know the whereabouts of his client.
   Others charged were fugitive Brig. Gen. Jose Zumel, key leader
of the December assault; Edgardo Abenina, Jr. son of another rebel
officer; and three businessmen _ Medardo Pestano, Crismel Verano
and Joaquin Venus. Venus is the former presidential assistant of
the late Ferdinand Marcos.
   Adaza is the third prominent civilian to have been charged in
connection with the December coup attempt. It was the sixth and
most serious attempt to overthrow Mrs. Aquino since she took power
in 1986.
   Others charged include Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who was arrested
in February but released on bail, and Rodolfo Aguinaldo, former
governor of Cagayan province who remains at large.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured in the
fighting in December.
   Adaza was formerly an Aquino supporter and a strident critic of
Marcos, who ruled for 20 years. He helped direct Mrs. Aquino's 1986
election campaign against Marcos but later broke with her because
of personal and philosophic differences.

   A series of aftershocks hit an area of western
China on Thursday following a strong quake two days earlier, and
regional officials said two people were hurt.
   On Tuesday, a quake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale hit West
Wuqia in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
   A woman at the Xinjiang Seismology Bureau said frequent
aftershocks measuring up to 4 on the Richter scale were still being
felt in the mountainous region.
   The official, who did not give her name, said two people were
injured, but she did not have details.
   Zhu Lingren, the bureau's deputy director, said Wednesday the
big quake's epicenter was in an unpopulated mountain range 37 to 43
miles southwest of Wuqia and less than 60 miles from the Soviet
border.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 6.4 could cause severe damage in a populated area.
   Foreigners have been barred this month from the area where the
quakes hit because of ethnic unrest. Local sources said troops were
dispatched to Kashgar and two other cities April 6 to quell rioting
by Xinjiang's Turkic-speaking Moslems.

   Heavy rains in Rio killed up to
seven people, news reports said Thursday. The downpour caused chaos
throughout the city and forced the postponement of a long-awaited
show by Paul McCartney.
   News media reported four people died late Wednesday when two
homes collapsed. Three others were electrocuted when they leanedon
light posts as they waded through flooded streets, according to
news reports.
   Police and Civil Defense officials told The Associated Press
they could not confirm the number of deaths.
   The rain caused massive traffic jams throughout Rio as cars
stalled in flooded streets. Traffic was backed up for hours on the
10-mile-long bridge that connects Rio to the neighboring city of
Niteroi on the other side of the Guanabara Bay.
   Promotors of McCartney's two scheduled shows at the Maracana
soccer stadium announced the first concert, scheduled Thursday
night, would be pushed back a day as rain forced workers to halt
construction of the stage.

<TEXT>
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano torched
another Hawaii Island home today, the 82nd destroyed during its
current eruption, and continued moving toward other dwellings in
its path, authorities said.
   A house in Kalapana Gardens Subdivision was ignited about 3:30
a.m. today, less than 12 hours after another home a short distance
away burned down, said Bruce Butts of the Hawaii County Civil
Defense Agency.
   The flow was moving toward another home that was about 350 feet
away, Butts said.
   The lava was coming from the north and was following the path of
another flow that destroyed two homes April 4. In all, the volcano
has destroyed six homes in the Kalapana area this month.
   There are about 120 homes in and around Kalapana Gardens
Subdivision.
   Residents in 26 homes remain on 24-hour evacuation alert.
Twenty-five homes were evacuated Sunday.
   Damage from the lava has totaled more than $20 million since the
volcano started erupting in January 1983.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Appoints Ministers of Health, Aviation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has appointed two
new ministers to head the departments of health and civil aviation,
the Tass news agency said.
   Igor Denisov was named to replace Yevgeny Chazov as minister of
health. Boris Panyukov was appointed minister of civil aviation,
taking over from Alexander Volkov, the news agency said Wednesday.
The two former ministers were relieved of their duties by Gorbachev
last month.
   Denisov takes over the health ministry at a time when the
department is under frequent attack for poor equipment and
training, shortages of medicine, and personnel that often seems
uncaring and lazy.
   The 49-year-old surgeon has been working in the health ministry
since 1987. He was first deputy minister in charge of personnel
training, health planning, economics and foreign relations in the
field of medicine, Tass said.
   Panykov, 60, has been involved in Soviet civil aviation since
1962 and held the title of first deputy minister before being
tapped by Gorbachev for the top job, the news agency said.
   The two appointees face confirmation hearings by the Supreme
Soviet legislature. No date for the hearings was announced.

<HEAD>Vandalized Rembrandt Going Back on Display</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rembrandt's ``Night Watch''
masterpiece will go back on display May 1, less than one month
after being sprayed with sulfuric acid by a man believed to be
mentally disturbed, officials said Thursday.
   No extra security will be introduced to protect the painting,
despite the fact the April 6 attack was the third against the
Rembrandt this century, said Det de Beus, spokeswoman for the
Rijksmuseum.
   The huge 1642 painting will be returned to its customary
center-stage spot in the main gallery in the Rijksmuseum, the
nation's largest treasure trove of art.
   A protective veneer layer prevented any damage to the work of
art, according to Ms. De Beus.
   ``The painting can withstand an attack as it is,'' she told The
Associated Press, adding: ``It's not as if it is attacked every
day. The last one was 15 years ago.''
   In 1975, a Dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission
slashed the painting with a knife. He was sent to a psychiatric
hospital, where he committed suicide.
   During World War I, a jobless shoemaker slashed the canvas to
protest his inability to find work.
   In the latest attack, a 31-year-old Dutchman squirted sulfuric
acid onto the canvas. He is undergoing psychiatric treatment.
   The acid ate away at the veneer layer, leaving several dozen
white streaks over a one-square-yard area of the canvas. The
painting measures 12-by-14.5 feet.
   ``But the paint layer was not harmed at all,'' said Ms. De Beus,
adding that restorers were able to begin refinishing the painting
last week without having to retouch the paintwork.
   Working in a dust-free room in the museum, the restorers will
apply the second and final veneer coat Friday. It is expected to
dry by May 1.
   The protective veneer layer was put on the painting during the
lengthy restoration that followed the 1975 attack.
   ``Night Watch,'' a group portrait of 17th-century Dutch
militiamen, draws far more museum viewers than any other painting
in the Netherlands.
   The priceless painting, renowned for Rembrandt's mastery of
light and dark, is not insured in line with Dutch government policy.
   Two guards are stationed by the ``Night Watch'' during museum
hours. One of them sprayed a neutralizing agent over the painting
after the acid attack.
   A knee-high steel barrier keeps viewers approximately two yards
away from the painting.

<HEAD>Former Political Prisoner Becomes Nepalese Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, a leader of the
pro-democracy movement who spent 14 years in jail, on Thursday
became prime minister of Nepal's first independent government in
almost three decades.
   King Birendra administered Bhattarai's oath of office at the
royal palace, embarking on a new political course for the Himalayan
monarchy where Birendra once wielded absolute power.
   After the ceremony at Narayan-heti palace, Bhattarai drove to
the government secretariat where he swore in nine ministers. His
10th minister missed the ceremony because of a flight delay, the
prime minister said.
   ``The responsibility weighs very heavy on my shoulders,''
Bhattarai said after the swearing-in ceremony, which was attended
by government officials and hundreds of supporters.
   Bhattarai, president of the Nepali Congress party, now heads a
coalition interim government composed of democrats, communists,
royalists and independents.
   Four ministers, including Bhattarai, belong to the Nepali
Congress. Three are members of the seven-party United Left Front;
two are Birendra's nominees; and two are independents.
   Bhattarai said his government would like to lessen the
economical difficulties of the people and ``make life easier and
less expensive than what it is today.''
   Nepal has a per capital annual income of $150 and is one of the
world's poorest countries. Seventy-five percent of its 17 million
people are illiterate.
   The palace ceremony was closed to the public and press. Hundreds
of people packed the secretariat conference hall, the size of a
hockey field, where the ministers were sworn in.
   The pro-democracy movement, led by Nepali Congress and the
United Left Front, started Feb. 18 with a series of demonstrations
and strikes in this remote mountain kingdom where political protest
was forbidden.
   On April 8, Birendra bowed to protesters' demands and lifted a
29-year-old ban on political parties.
   The surprising announcement followed an April 6 crackdown on
demonstrators that witnesses called a massacre. Authorities said 10
people were killed and 107 injured that day throughout the country.
Witnesses said 200 died in Katmandu alone when police fired on
marchers.
   On April 16, Birendra dissolved the non-partisan National
Assembly and announced the resignation of the government, meeting
major opposition demands.
   The two Cabinet members nominated by Birendra are Achyut Raj
Regmi, a minister in the former Cabinet and a former Nepali
Congress member; and Keshar Jung Rayamajhi, a former Nepal
Communist Party member.
   The ministers' oath called for allegiance to Nepal's present
constitution, which gives near-absolute powers to the king. But
Bhattarai has said a new constitution will be drafted to reduce the
king's powers.
   The new government has promised to hold multiparty elections
within a year.
   The Nepali Congress formed the country's first democratically
elected government in 1959. It lasted only 20 months before
Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed it, accusing it of
corruption and poor administration.
   Mahendra introduced a new constitution and ruled the country
through the National Assembly and the submissive government.
   Bhattarai was the Parliament speaker in the 1959-60 government.
He was jailed for nine years immediately after Mahendra dissolved
that government and spent a total of five more years in jail at
different times for political agitation.

<HEAD>Religious Strife Deaths Jump 83 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deaths linked to religious tensions in
India jumped 750 percent in 1989, according to figures released
Thursday.
   Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed said 491 of the 607 deaths
occurred in Bihar state, the scene of bloody clashes between Hindus
and Moslems.
   Sayeed's figures did not include killings in the northwestern
state of Punjab, where Sikh militants are fighting for a separate
homeland. At least 1,821 people died in separatist violence there
in 1989. More than 600 have died this year.
   It also did not include bloodshed in Kashmir, where Moslem
militants are trying to secede from India. More than 270 people
have died in separatist violence in Jammu-Kashmir state this year.
   Sayeed told Parliament that in 1988, 80 people died in
``communal violence.'' That is the term used by Indian officials
and news media to describe ethnic, religious or caste-related
clashes. In 1987, the total was 331.
   The majority of India's communal violence occurs between Hindus
and Moslems. India's 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu, while
12 percent are Moslems.
   The most recent clash occurred in the western state of Gujarat.
More than 30 people were killed in riots that broke out this month
in the state after a Hindu boy who was in love with a Moslem girl
was stabbed to death.
   Not all of the violence involves Hindus and Moslems.
   In the state of Assam, members of the Bodo tribe, who worship
spirits believed to inhabit rocks and trees, have been agitating
for a separate homeland. Last week, attacks by suspected Bodo
militants left 25 dead. So far this year, 43 people have died in
such violence.
   Clashes in central India between security forces and Naxalites,
a band with roots in Maoist Marxism, have left 93 dead so far this
year, Sayeed said.

   The rap group 2 Live Crew performed
before hundreds of fans early today without incident despite
threats by a prosecutor to have the musicians arrested on obscenity
charges.
   The band began its 90-minute concert shortly after midnight,
opening with a song called ``Martinez Rap,'' about Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez's campaign against explicit lyrics.
   The nightclub Central City was filled to its 1,500-person
capacity at $12.50 a ticket for the one-night stand.
   ``Just business as usual. Arrests? Not by this department,''
said a duty officer at Gainesville police headquarters who asked
not to be named. ``This whole thing, we understand, was being
publicized by the state attorney's office.''
   State attorney Len Register had called some of 2 Live Crew's
sexually explicit songs ``the most filthy thing I've ever
encountered.'' He threatened to have the band arrested if they
played uncensored versions of songs such as ``Me So Horny,'' and
``Move Somethin,'' which has lyrics referring to sadomasochistic
sex and violence against women.
   Debbie Bennett, spokeswoman for the group in Miami, said it
played its usual concert, including adult lyrics. She said the
group had an attorney on standby and bail money available if
Register had followed up on his threat.
   Register's office said this morning that he was in meetings, and
that he was not immediately available for comment on why his threat
was not carried out.
   Police spokeswoman Sadie Darnell said before the concert that
police received no special orders from the state attorney's office.
``I don't feel this issue is over,'' though, she said this morning.
   No Alachua County sheriff's officers were sent to the nightclub
either, clerk Lashaun Butler said.
   Local officials in some Florida counties have banned some 2 Live
Crew albums, especially one called ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
State legislatures in several states also have begun considering
mandatory record labeling acts because of the group's material.
   The Miami-based group is led by Luther ``Luke Skyywalker''
Campbell. Members are David ``Mr. Mixx'' Hobbs, Chris ``Fresh Ice
Kid'' Won Wong and Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross.

   The Kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural
gas to Lithuania today, hours after it halted the flow of crude oil
to the republic for refusing to scrap laws promoting independence,
Lithuanian officials said.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said Moscow's economic
embargo was tantamount to it recognizing his Baltic republic's
independence.
   A Soviet energy official, however, said the Lithuanians got what
they deserved for defying President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who on
Friday threatened to cut off supplies unless they rescinded their
independence-oriented laws.
   A Lithuanian government spokesman appealed over Vilnius Radio
today for fuel conservation, ``and maybe we will not be intimidated
by these sanctions.''
   As the events in Lithuania unfolded, Gorbachev met in the
Kremlin today with leaders of Latvia and Estonia and offered
concessions and made threats in an effort to keep them in the
Soviet Union, participants said.
   Gorbachev offered both republics ``special status'' in the
Soviet Union if they drop their attempts to follow Lithuania into
independence, said Raymond Lochmelis of the Latvian Popular Front
and other officials present.
   The Soviet leader also proposed a loose confederative system
instead of a union tightly controlled by the center. He also
reportedly threatened to end the talks unless Estonia rescinded its
claim that it is an occupied independent state and Latvia canceled
its plan to declare independence on May 3.
   The flow of natural gas to Lithuania was shut off in three
pipelines _ two from Latvia and one from Minsk in Byelorussia _
reducing supplies to Lithuania by more than 80 percent, Lithuanian
lawmakers said.
   A fourth pipeline from Slonim in Byelorussia that supplies
Lithuania continued to provide 3.5 million cubic meters of gas to
the republic, guaranteeing ``a normal supply of gas for residents
and communal domestic use in the Lithuanian S.S.R.,'' parliamentary
officials quoted the Byelorussian gas concern's telegram as saying.
   That leaves Lithuania with only 16 percent of the gas it needs
per day. Lithuania uses an average of 18 million cubic meters daily
for industrial and domestic use.
   Lithuanian officials estimate the republic has enough oil to
last six weeks to three months.
   Juozas Martusevicius, a Lithuanian electrical official, said
Moscow officials guaranteed that enough natural gas would be
supplied to keep Lithuania's Elektrenai power plant functioning.
The plant also serves customers in the neighboring Russian republic
territory of Kaliningrad. Lithuania's sole nuclear power station,
in Ignalina, is shut down for repairs.
   Lithuania is entirely dependent on Moscow for oil and gas, and
the embargo was the toughest action Gorbachev has taken in his
effort to force the republic of 3.8 million people to rescind its
March 11 declaration of independence.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said today
that Moscow ``might have some other restrictions'' to impose on
Lithuania, but he refused to elaborate.
   Late Wednesday night, the oil to Lithuania's only refinery
stopped flowing through a pipeline feeding the plant from the
Russian city of Polotsk, according to Bronius Vainoras, director of
the facility.
   Vainoras told the British Broadcasting Corp. that the refinery
will have to close if supplies are not restored. Half of the
refinery was working but at a reduced capacity, he said.
   Landsbergis, speaking after Lithuania's parliament had refused a
Kremlin ultimatum and instead offered to negotiate, said
Gorbachev's move represented ``economic coercion and economic
warfare against a neighboring country.''
   ``Truly, this is recognition of the independence of Lithuania,''
he said. ``It is hard to imagine why the people of Lithuania,
irrespective of nationality and creed, are being punished. What was
their crime?''
   In Moscow, Deputy Oil Minister Lev Dmitrievich Churilov said his
department cut off the oil _ mostly Siberian crude _ after
receiving a decree from the Soviet Council of Ministers ordering
the shutdown ``until further special notice.''
   Lithuania's Mazhiekiai refinery processes about 12 million tons
of petroleum products a year. Lithuania uses about a quarter of the
output, journalists quoted Lithuanian government officials as
saying.
   Neighboring Baltic states Latvia and Estonia _ themselves moving
along a slower path toward independence _ won't be hurt by the
cutoff to Lithuania, Churilov said. Lithuania's supplies will now
go to the republics of Byelorussia, the Ukraine and Russia, as well
as Eastern Europe, he said.
   Noting that he was expressing his personal opinion, Churilov
told The Associated Press that the cutoff might teach the
Lithuanians a lesson.
   ``Maybe this measure can make them think a little,'' he said.
``They should not respond to appeals from the president and
government with ultimatums.''
   Lithuanian officials met today to discuss the cuts in energy
supplies, said spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas, with the priority being
given to the power industry, bakeries and the food industry.
   He said that in the areas of fuel and power, Lithuanians would
be put on ``a starvation diet.''
   ``Where we can give up the use of gas, petrol, any heating or
lighting, let us do this, and then we will be able to survive
longer and, maybe, we will not be intimidated by these sanctions,''
Jursenas said in his appeal.
   Sales of gasoline in Lithuania tripled this week as motorists
reacted to Gorbachev's threat with panic-buying, said Lithuanian
Energy Minister Leonas Asmantas.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene was in Norway
today, seeking oil to help offset the embargo. Norwegian Prime
Minister Jan P. Syse said his country has not promised oil supplies
to Lithuania.
   ``We don't expect the world to give us any concrete goods at the
moment ... all we are after is moral support,'' Mrs. Prunskiene
said. ``We believe Lithuania will survive without natural gas but
life will be reduced, cut off from normal possibilities.''
   The White House said today that President Bush was consulting
with U.S. allies on ``appropriate responses'' to the Lithuanian
crisis.
   Prior to the cutoff, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
action against Lithuania could destroy commercial relations between
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   ``It's very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion'' he said.
   Gorbachev has declared unconstitutional Lithuania's moves to
curtail the spring draft into the Soviet army, give residents
Lithuanian identity cards and seize the property of the Communist
Party on Lithuanian territory.
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along
with the fellow Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia.

<TEXT>
   A top Bush administration official said today
that the U.S. trade deficit could worsen this year and warned that
Japan's closed markets pose ``important risks for the world
economy.''
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said that there is more at
stake than reducing America's huge trade imbalance. He said growing
protectionist threats could imperil world prosperity.
   ``If we are going to preserve the global trading system, we are
going to have to insist that Japan and others who share the
benefits do their part,'' Mulford said. ``Clearly, Japan has not
done its part.''
   Mulford's comments were part of the administration's continuing
campaign to pressure Japan to open its markets further for foreign
trade. Many have grown concerned that a big decline in the value of
the yen in recent months threatens to worsen the $49 billion trade
deficit between the two nations.
   A weaker yen would make Japanese products less expensive in this
country while making American goods more costly in Japan.
   ``The depreciation of the yen and Japan's relatively closed
markets are not sustainable over time as their continuation would
pose important risks for the world economy,'' Mulford said in
testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee.
   Mulford said that any further improvement in America's broadest
measure of trade, the current account, was likely to be ``very
modest and the possibility of deterioration in the current account
cannot be excluded.''
   Mulford's comments echoed the outlook in a new adminisration
assessemnt prepared by the Treasury Department which said further
improvement in the trade balance this year would be ``modest at
best.''
   While this forecast is in line with the view of many private
economists, it poses a threat to the optimistic economic
assumptions underlying President Bush's 1991 budget.
   A widening of the trade deficit would worsen the slump in
manufacturing as companies found it harder to sell their products
overseas. Further weakness in manufacturing could seriously depress
overall economic growth.
   The broadest measure of U.S. trade, the current account, posted
a deficit of $105.9 billion in 1989. It had posted an all-time high
of $143.7 billion in 1987. The current account measures both trade
in merchandise and services, a category that primarily reflects
investment flows between countries.
   So far this year, the merchandise portion of the trade deficit
has been on a roller coaster, surging to $9.32 billion in January,
only to drop to $6.49 billion in February as oil imports retreated
from a record high set the month before.
   Many private economists look for America's oil dependence to
deepen in coming months as domestic production slumps further.
Another negative factor on the trade front is the recent strength
of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Japanese yen.
   A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive on overseas
markets and makes foreign imports cheaper for American consumers.
   The United States has often joined with other leading industrial
countries in coordinated efforts to keep currency rates in line as
a way at attacking trade imbalances.
   The Group of Seven nations _ the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ last met in Paris
earlier this month. They promised then to continue their
coordination efforts but rejected petitions by Japanese officials
for stronger action to bolster the sagging yen.
   In the trade assessment, the administration declared that ``the
yen's weakness is a matter of concern, with undesirable
consequences for the global adjustment process.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady gave a similar view in
congressional testimony but did not offer any specific actions the
administration was willing to take.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan widened to $3.12 billion in
February from $2.86 billion in January.
   The administration's trade report said the dramatic political
changes occurring in Eastern Europe had the potential of easing
global trade imbalances.
   The report said the unification of West and East Germany should
help lower West Germany's large trade surpluses because the united
country would have more demand for imported products. However, it
said, the prime beneficiaries of this development were likely to be
other countries in Europe, not the United States.
   On another point, the report said Taiwan and South Korea had
made progress in liberalizing their currency exchange-rate policies
but that both nations need to make further progress.
   The two countries had been cited in previous reports for
manipulating their currencies in order to bolster their export
sales, particularly with the United States, their primary foreign
market.

<HEAD>State Department Warns Americans on Travel in Philippines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has advised
Americans not to travel to eight areas of the Philippines because
of continued crime and danger from insurgents, according to the
U.S. Embassy.
   The latest travel advisory was issued April 9 and will be in
effect for a year, an embassy official said.
   At least eight Americans have been killed in Communist
insurgency-related incidents here in the last four years.
   Americans should avoid Kalinga-Apayao province, Isabela province
and the Cagayan Valley region on the main island of Luzon. Samar
island and Masbate province in the central Philippines also should
be avoided. The other areas on the advisory are Lanao del Sur, Sulu
province, and Basilan island in the southern Mindanao island group.
   It said travel to most tourist destinations and urban areas in
the Philippines is generally considered safe but that Americans
should stay away from entertainment districts at night because of
high crime.
   ``Only national highways and paved roads should be used. Except
for major urban areas, road travel at night should be avoided,'' it
added.
   Americans should check with the U.S. Embassy or with local
officials before leaving the capital, the warning said.
   It noted that while there were no warnings against travel to the
six U.S.-run military installations in the Philippines, Americans
should take precautions because of threats against military
personnel and facilities.
   In March, Communist rebels kill an American rancher in Masbate
province for refusing to pay ``revolutionary taxes'' to the
insurgents.
   An American geologist, his Filipino wife and his father-in-law
were killed in an ambush by guerrillas last February in Bohol
province.
   In September last year, Communist guerrillas killed two American
civilian employees at a U.S. Air Force post. A year ago, Communist
assassins gunned down a U.S. Army colonel on his way to work in
suburban Quezon City.
   In October 1987, insurgents shot to death three Americans in
attacks outside Clark Air Base.
   The Communist New People's Army is widely believed to be
operating in most of the country's 75 provinces. It is the armed
wing of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines, which has
been fighting a 21-year-old insurgency.
   Moslem rebels have also been waging a largely dormant war for
self-rule in Mindanao for the past 18 years. Several pirate groups
and kidnapping syndicates also operate in the region.

   A California sea lion that wandered 100
miles up the San Joaquin River was shot to death, authorities said.
   The 214-pound seal named Judge was found beached Sunday on the
river bank west of Modesto. Two days later, it was found dead with
a gunshot wound, said Warden Hugh Rutherford of the state
Department of Fish and Game.
   ``I got a call about a seal in the river. I said `A seal? A
seal, as in Sam-Edward-Adam-Lincoln?' Who ever heard of a seal in
the San Joaquin River?'' Rutherford asked.
   Rutherford said Judge apparently got lost while in the San
Francisco Bay.
   Authorities haven't determined who shot the seal, but if caught
the person could face a year in jail and a $20,000 fine.
   Judge was raised at the California Marine Mammal Center in
Sausalito and tagged before being released into the wild,
Rutherford said.

<HEAD>Honduran President Says Democratic Progress Linked to Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States risks erosions of Central
America's recent democratic progress if it fails to fulfill aid
commitments to Honduras and its neighbors, Honduran president
Rafael Callejas said Thursday.
   Callejas said he encountered ``a lot of good will'' in
discussions with administration and congressional officials this
week on U.S. plans to provide $80 million in economic aid to his
country in the 1991 fiscal year.
   But he also was realistic about the political unpopularity of
foreign aid in the United States and the increased competition for
aid dollars from emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   ``We understand the difficulties in the United States and the
new perspectives in Eastern Europe,'' Callejas said at a news
conference.
   ``Without economic support, the Central American region will
again have social unrest, and its consequences ... will be a
weakening of the democratic system.''
   U.S. aid is the only source of short-term financing for the
country's balance of payment needs, he said.
   He added: ``The environment for government is not easy,'' citing
a decade of economic reversal in his country he said would take two
decades to overcome.
   But Callejas said a $247 million international loan to pay off
past-due debts to international financial institutions will help
Honduras begin an economic turnaround by the end of next month.
   Since he was sworn in on Jan. 27, the 46-year-old, U.S.-educated
president has launched sweeping economic reforms, including raising
taxes and cutting his government's budget to reduce the deficit.
   Increasing the region's political stability will help warm the
climate for international investment, Callejas said, specifically
mentioning development of the tourism and agricultural sectors.
   In the long run, ``the vital element is not foreign aid but
trade,'' he said. During his visit, he sought to open talks about
possible future opening of U.S. markets to his country's sugar,
coffee, textiles and footwear, said Callejas.
   He conceded those goods are ``politically subject to very
intense dialogue'' because of protectionist sentiments in the
United States and said no opening was likely in the next two years.
   ``Achieving perfection is very complex,'' he said. ``We're
looking for a political will demonstration that trade for Central
America will be opened.''
   On other subjects, Callejas said:
   _He welcomed news of a truce in Nicaragua between the Sandinista
government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. ``This implies that
there is a guaranteed transition of the presidency in Nicaragua and
a willingness to dialogue in the search for solutions,'' he said.
   _An informal congressional delegation from Honduras is visiting
Cuba, but there is no intent to formalize diplomatic relations.
``It is the only Hispanic nation (in the hemisphere) that is not
democratic. There is a requirement that they change their political
attitudes,'' he said.
   _It is too soon to talk about economic integration for Central
America, until peace is achieved in El Salvador and the new
Nicaraguan government can be solidified. But an economic summit in
June or July that will include Belize and Panama will be a forum
for discussion of such issues, he said.

   A bomb set by Sikh separatists exploded
in a fast-moving bus in Punjab state, killing at least 15
passengers and injuring 44, police said. Nine people were in
critical condition.
   In other incidents of violence in the state, seven people were
shot and killed by the militants, Press Trust of India news agency
reported. At least eight militants were killed.
   Police official Brijender Singh said the bomb exploded in a
state-owned bus near Bharoli village, about 60 miles northeast of
Amritsar. The Sikh holy city of Amritsar is a main center of the
Sikh separatist movement.
   The bus was on a 180-mile run from the Punjab town of Moga to
Jammu, in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Singh, the police chief in the area where the bombing occurred,
said the vehicle was traveling at 50 mph when the bomb went off. It
exploded in the rear of the bus, starting a fire.
   The dead were identifed as 10 men, three women and two children.
Thirteen victims were Hindus, India's religious majority. The other
two were Sikhs.
   PTI said Sikh militants had shot and killed seven people across
the state since Wednesday.
   Four militants were killed during armed encounters with police.
Four others died in a Sikh gang war, PTI said.
   On Sunday, five people were killed when a bomb hidden in a
tractor exploded outside a Hindu temple in Ludhiana, 70 miles
southeast of Amritsar. Police blamed the Ludhiana bombing on Sikh
militants.
   The extremists have killed 631 people so far this year in
Punjab, the only Indian state where Sikhs form a slight majority
over Hindus.
   Nationwide, Sikhs account for 2 percent of the population, while
82 percent of the 880 million Indians are Hindus.
   Militants in the Sikh community seek a separate nation to guard
against what they call cultural and political discrimination by
Hindus.

   With East-West tensions in decline, the Bush
administration is postponing indefinitely the development of new
short-range nuclear missiles that were to be based in West Germany,
U.S. officials said Thursday.
   The 88 new launchers, 36 of which were to be controlled by the
United States and the others by West Germany, Britain and the
Netherlands, were designed for targeting on East Germany. They
would have been capable of launching about 1,600 missiles.
   The tentative U.S. goal had been to begin deploying the missiles
in 1995 to replace the current mixture of nuclear-armed and
conventional Lance missiles with an all-nuclear force and an
expanded range.
   But East Germany is rapidly moving out of the Soviet orbit and
preparing for union with West Germany. It is no longer perceived as
a threat to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.
   The current arsenal of Lances will remain in West Germany. About
700 carry nuclear warheads and have a range of about 75 miles. The
900 or so non-nuclear missiles in the arsenal are designed to hit
targets within 45 miles.
   The new launchers were intended to have a range of about 280
miles, just below the level of intermediate-range nuclear missiles
that were banned in a U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, called the decision sensible and in line with what he
had advocated the move for some time.
   In a speech, Nunn also called for sharp reductions in U.S.
forces in Europe beyond the 225,000 level proposed by the Bush
administration and tentatively approved by the Soviet Union, which
would cut back to 195,000 troops beyond its border.
   ``We should start planning on a residual force in Europe on the
order of 75,000 to 100,000 troops within five years,'' Nunn said.
He also suggested cutting the Navy's 14 carrier battle groups to 10
to 12.
   Congress appropriated $32 million last year to develop the new
Lance missiles. The Pentagon has requested $112 million for this
year. Overall, the program would have cost more than $1 billion,
Dunbar Lockwood of the private Arms Control Association estimated.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said the future of the
Lance was a decision for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He said, however, that the Army Missiles Command had put a hold
on plans to issue a formal request for contractors' proposals for
building the new weapons.
   ``The Army has delayed the release of the final request for
proposals on the follow-on to Lance,'' he said.
   Another U.S. official told The Associated Press that ``the
present system is a viable deterrent through the year 2000, even
though the Army would have liked to start deployment of new Lances
in 1995.''
   The current Lances recently were touched up with new fuel for
their rockets, the replacement of worn-out components and other
maintenance.
   All the new Lances were supposed to be nuclear-armed.
   Their potential deployment had stirred opposition among West
German groups eager to promote disarmament and concerned that
deploying new weapons on their territory could make West Germany a
more inviting target in the event of a war.
   As East-West tensions have eased, support for the missiles has
declined in the West German government and among several of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
   Still, the Reagan and Bush administrations resisted efforts led
by West Germany for negotiations to eliminate both NATO and Warsaw
Pact short-range missiles until a treaty to cut back troops, tanks
and other weapons in Europe is concluded.
   The accord is still not finished. But, the officials said, the
Bush administration has decided not to have the Army Missile
Command solicit proposals from munitions makers for manufacturing
new Lance missiles.
   ``The project has been put on indefinite hold,'' said a U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the current Lance arsenal would serve as a deterrent
through the rest of the century.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes to Spend More on Organic Farming Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee voted
Thursday to increase spending for research on organic farming
nearly tenfold.
   Conventional farming methods promoted by the federal government
over the last several decades have involved a growing use of
chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, which
environmentalists and many farmers are beginning to consider
detrimental.
   The committee voted to increase the $4.5 million being spent
this year on organic farming to $40 million annually. It also
authorized $10 million a year to train thousands of extension
agents in non-chemical farming methods.
   The authorization is the first major step the government has
taken to get farming out of the chemical business.
   The legislation, approved on voice vote, also would establish a
groundwater office in the Agriculture Department to determine the
extent of damage to drinking water caused by agriculture chemicals
and how to correct it.
   The proposals were among the provisions of the committee's
agricultural research section, or title, of its 1990 farm bill.
   Another provision requires USDA to study the effects of climate
change on food crops and forests.
   ``Many scientists believe that a four degree rise in average
temperature could halve the world's production of rice _ the staff
of life for 70 percent of the world's population,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee.
   Federal agriculture officials would be required to integrate
global warming concerns into plant and forestry research planning
and decision-making and to establish an office of climate change if
the legislation is adopted.
   Both the Senate and House agriculture committees have been
working since January on the 1990 farm bill, which will set policy
for virtually all federal agriculture programs during the next five
years.
   The panels are in different stages of completion on the various
parts of the legislation, which they hope to have before the full
Congress by summer.
   The Senate's section on research would authorize an
unprecedented $400 million over the life of the bill for research
grants to companies, institutions and individuals studying plants,
animals, nutrition and health, natural resources and the
environment, new products and marketing and trade.
   The bill also creates partnerships among researchers, state and
local governments, private businesses and the federal government
for developing and selling industrial products made from farm and
forest crops.
   Progress is being made, for example, in using corn and wheat to
make biodegradable plastic bags and diapers. Soybeans are being
experimented with in the manufacture of lubricants and printing
ink; sunflowers in fuel and red dye; meadowfoam in cosmetics; and
milkweed in pillow stuffing and backpacking equipment.

   Reputed mobster John Gotti's son is reportedly
getting married Saturday, and the lucky woman is in the mob version
of the federal witness protection program _ no one is willing to
identify her.
   ``We keep everything confidential,'' said Maria DeCandia, who
runs Hidden Assets, a lingerie store where the son, John A. Gotti,
is known to shop.
   ``I have nothing to say. No dice,'' said the pastor of Our Lady
of Grace Roman Catholic Church.
   ``I don't know anything about a wedding. Didn't hear about a
wedding. Shows how stupid we are. We don't even know about a
wedding,'' said the groom's uncle, Pete Gotti.
   These comments were harvested by the Daily News, which quoted
sources as saying that a reception for 200 people was planned at
the Helmsley Palace Hotel. But few other details were forthcoming
about the nuptials.
   The elder Gotti himself answered queries with a cold stare as he
entered his favorite haunt, the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club. Others
in Gotti's Queens neighborhood said they were in the dark.
   ``Of course we've heard about it,'' said Nancy, a manicurist who
works next door to the Bergin. ``But we have no idea who she is.
Nobody knows. It's the question of the day.''
   ``We just heard about it. He's really a very nice boy. Who's the
girl? Have you heard?'' said Gotti's next-door neighbor, Jack
Stillman.
   Law enforcement officials have alleged that the younger Gotti
joined the mob last year. He is 26 and is said to be president of a
Brooklyn trucking company; he has been arrested several times in
bar fights.
   His father, known as the Dapper Don, is reputedly head of the
Gambino organization, which authorities say is the nation's most
powerful crime family.

   Thousands of radical students clashed
with riot police Thursday during nationwide protests marking the
30th anniversary of an uprising that toppled the country's first
authoritarian government.
   ``Crush the pro-American fascist regime!'' yelled students as
they hurled rocks and firebombs at riot troops in Seoul.
   News reports said at least 30,000 radicals and dissidents
protested in at least six cities. Police reported 25,000 students
rallied at 76 colleges and universities and about 10,000 of the
protesters were violent.
   About 50 arrests were reported in Seoul. No injuries were
reported, but dozens of police and protesters were hit by rocks or
glass as firebombs exploded.
   In addition to Seoul, violent clashes erupted at schools in the
central provincial cities of Taejon and Kongju, and in the eastern
cities of Chunchon, Kongneung and Wonju, according to Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed to protect government
buildings, train stations and downtown areas.
   Thursday was the 30th anniversary of the student-led uprising
that ended the 12-year authoritarian rule of President Syngman
Rhee. Radicals, who have lost support due to their violent tactics,
said the anniversary would mark the beginning of fresh
anti-government and anti-U.S. protests.
   They also were protesting the merger in January of the ruling
party and two opposition parties into a huge conservative governing
party.
   ``Destroy the merger!'' yelled some 1,000 radical students
wielding metal pipes and hurling firebombs and rocks at Seoul's
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. ``Down with (President) Roh
Tae-woo!''
   As night fell, bands of 50 to 100 students ran through downtown
areas jabbing their fists in the air and shouting anti-government
slogans.
   The protests backed up traffic on one of Seoul's main bridges
and sent shopkeepers and pedestrians racing for cover to escape
acrid gas.
   The 1960 uprising is generally regarded as the beginning of
Korean democracy, and the anniversary is celebrated by both
radicals and government officials.
   ``The April 19 uprising was part of a movement to protect free
democracy by youths and students who rose against government
oppression,'' Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said at a ceremony
marking the anniversary.
   ``The precious sacrifice of those slain brought a victory for
civil rights as well as a historic turning point for developing a
free democracy,'' he said.
   Police with black paint moved onto Chungang University early
Thursday and removed traces of a U.S. flag painted on a campus
road. Students have painted U.S. flags on campus roads to let
pedestrians trample on them and stimulate anti-U.S. feeling.
   Officials warned that burning or defaming American flags ``could
damage the traditional friendly relationship'' with the United
States.
   Dissidents say the presence of the 43,000 U.S. troops in South
Korea prevents reunification of North and South Korea. The radicals
are a small but vocal minority in South Korea.

<HEAD>Census Counts On Despite Slow Public Response</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau remains determined to count
Americans, but the bureau director said Thursday that lagging
public response means it will take more people and money to do it.
   ``We plan to follow up on every housing unit for which a
questionnaire was not returned and we have the workforce to do
it,'' bureau Director Barbara E. Bryant told the House Census
subcommittee.
   ``The only thing that has changed is that our workload of
personal-visit followup will be larger than originally planned.''
   To date, 63 percent of households have returned the forms; the
bureau had hoped for a 70 percent return by this time.
   Bryant said it would take an extra 5,300 workers and cost an
additional $10 million to count each percentage point below the 70
percent level.
   ``A 63 percent mail response is by no means a disaster,'' she
said.
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, said he was ``deeply troubled'' by the
low level of participation so far. Public confidence, he said, may
be shaken by reports of millions of forms that could not be
delivered for various reasons.
   ``We have had some operational problems and our mail-response
came in lower than expected. ... We remain convinced we will have
an accurate census,'' Bryant said.
   Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., said the bureau does have problems,
but ``it's not a crisis, it's not a disaster.''
   ``You cannot conclude that we will not have an accurate
census,'' Ridge said. ``What you can conclude is that it will cost
a lot more money.''
   Bryant said the low response rate could boost the cost by $70
million. The bureau has already taken a $60 million cut in general
government budget trimming.
   Asked if her agency would be asking for about $100 million in
added money, she declined to be specific.
   ``It could be more than that,'' she said.
   The overall cost of the 1990 national head count, spread over 10
years, is expected to total about $2.5 billion.
   Asked about problems in large buildings and whole towns and ZIP
codes being missed, Bryant said about 5 million forms were mailed
late because addresses were added for new developments and for
places not included earlier.
   In late summer, there will be a followup to reach people who
were missed, and local governments will check the counts for
accuracy, she said.
   About 4.8 million forms were returned to the bureau as
undeliverable, a rate Bryant said was well below that of the 1980
census. She said that occurred in many cases because some people
get their mail in post office boxes while the census uses street
addresses.
   The street addresses are needed to design political districts.
   About 1.8 million of the returned forms have been delivered by
hand. Of the remaining 3 million, she said most will turn out to be
vacant homes and apartments. All locations will be visited.
   People who have not received forms, she said, should call the
bureau at 1-800-999-1990.
   The bureau will begin sending out about 330,000 workers April 26
to visit homes where people did not respond, Bryant said.

   Eastern Airlines said today it would not appeal
a federal bankruptcy judge's appointment of a trustee to take
control of the airline, a move that ousts boss Frank Lorenzo from
that role.
   ``Although we did not feel a trustee is warranted, we are
gratified Judge Burton Lifland has indicated the airline will be
reorganized and not broken into pieces,'' said spokesman Bob Hunter
in Miami.
   Lifland late Wednesday granted the request of Eastern's
unsecured creditors, who sought a trustee because of frustration
over the carrier's mounting losses and its plans to cut payments to
creditors sharply.
   ``The flying public's interest must at all times be taken into
account,'' Lifland told a packed courtroom, adding later, ``It's
time to change the captain of Eastern's crew.''
   The head of Eastern's Machinists, while welcoming the move, said
today the action would not mean a quick end to his union's year-old
strike.
   ``It will not happen immediately,'' Eastern Machinists president
Charles Bryan told a news conference in Miami. ``Obviously we have
no interest in going back and sacrificing, working very hard and
bringing it out of bankruptcy, only to still have Frank Lorenzo own
all the common stock.''
   The judge appointed as trustee Martin Shugrue, a pilot and
airline executive who formerly worked for Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.
   Shugrue, a former president of Continental Airlines, resigned
last year under pressure from Lorenzo. Texas Air also is the parent
of Continental.
   Lorenzo left the courtroom without comment before the decision.
Hunter said today that the company welcomed Shugrue's arrival.
   ``There are no changes, it's business as usual,'' Hunter said.
``His appointment does send a very clear message of Judge Lifland's
confidence in the company's future _ he said he would appoint a
trustee to operate the airline, not to liquidate it.''
   Miami-based Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization since March 1989, after a strike by its pilots,
Machinists and flight attendants crippled its operations.
   The unions had sought a trustee from the start, claiming that
Lorenzo was bleeding Eastern by transferring its assets to
non-union Continental and Texas Air, and they had heaped
practically all their hostility on him alone.
   Dick Nellis, a representative of Eastern's pilots union, said he
was ``overjoyed'' at the ruling but added: ``It is really very sad
that it has taken so long for the system to recognize why the real
Eastern employees left the property in the first place.''
   ``Literally, there have been thousands of careers that have been
shattered and billions of dollars of Eastern Airlines assets
wasted,'' he said.
   Earlier, Eastern President Phil Bakes testified that appointment
of a trustee would prompt employees to quit, hurt business further
and heighten the chance Eastern eventually would have to be
liquidated.
   E.J. Breen, a spokesman for the pilots union in Miami, said the
appointment of Shugrue would give Eastern another chance to succeed.
   The appointment of a trustee in a bankruptcy case is rare, legal
experts observed.
   Lifland said naming a trustee ``is an extraordinary remedy,''
but he cited Eastern's staggering losses of more than $1.2 billion
since the bankruptcy filing, which he said had ``wiped out the
parent's equity.''
   The judge also noted numerous instances where the company had
projected overly optimistic results and then cut the amount it
proposed to repay creditors in successive reorganization plans.
   The unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million, had
repeatedly emphasized that they did not seek a liquidation of the
airline. Instead, they asked for a trustee to operate Eastern and
perhaps seek a buyer for it.
   Lifland also said during the four-day hearing, which began
Friday, that if a trustee were appointed it would be someone to
operate rather than liquidate the airline.
   In closing statements, Eastern's court-appointed bankruptcy
examiner used strong language to describe the carrier's losses and
Lorenzo's management style, although he did not formally take a
position on the trustee request.
   Examiner David I. Shapiro told the court that other companies in
Chapter 11 had never been allowed to continue operating with such
big losses and with such a total lack of confidence from creditors.
   ``Can Mr. Lorenzo now be allowed to wipe out the creditors'
interest? Can anyone blame the creditors for being outraged?'' he
said. ``Mr. Lorenzo only starts negotiating at the very last
minute. ... He's just a tough guy to make a deal with.''
   Because of Lorenzo's style, Shapiro added, it would be easier to
sell Eastern under a trustee than under current management.

<HEAD>East German Leader Predicts Economic Merger in Eight Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's prime minister on Thursday
said the Germanys may merge their economies within eight weeks, but
he demanded that West Germany pay a bigger price for unification.
   Lothar de Maiziere also said East Germany would defend the
military interests of the Soviet Union but still would pursue the
quick path to unification that Moscow opposes.
   De Maiziere, in his first speech to the freely elected
Parliament, said a final plan for a single Germany could be in
place before Parliament breaks for the summer.
   ``In the next eight to 10 weeks we will lay the foundations for
the economic, monetary and social union so that this union can
enter into force before the summer break,'' he said.
   He said East Germany must be an equal partner in the talks and
that the nations ``must agree on conditions that ensure East
Germans do not get the feeling of being second-class German
citizens.''
   While a single currency and shared social and economic
institutions could be in place, long negotiations are expected on
the process of fully unifying the governments and creating a single
nation. The process is not expected to be completed until next year.
   De Maiziere reiterated that most East German marks, which are
virtually worthless, must be traded at a 1-1 rate to the powerful
West German mark when a single currency is created.
   But the vice president of the West German central bank, Helmut
Schlesinger, was quoted as saying a 1-1 exchange could lead to
higher inflation in West Germany.
   De Maiziere said he was concerned there was less willingness to
help among West Germans fearful that inflation and higher taxes may
be the price for bailing out the collapsing East German economy.
   ``We are not demanding sacrifices from you,'' he said. ``What we
expect is togetherness and solidarity. The division of Germany can
only be lifted by sharing.''
   De Maiziere, chosen as prime minister last week, also said most
of the remaining sections of the Berlin Wall would be torn down to
symbolize the end of 40 years of oppression.
   He said one piece would stand as a ``historical monument.''
   The wall and East Germany's other border controls were opened in
November during the pro-democracy revolt that toppled the former
hard-line Communist regime.
   He also said he expected the Germanys would field a single team
in the 1992 Olympics.
   De Maiziere, in a wide-ranging speech, also sought to ease
Soviet objections to quick unification.
   He said East Germany, now a member of the Warsaw Pact, would
protect the interests of the Soviet-led alliance when it negotiates
unification.
   He avoided direct reference to NATO. Last week, his coalition
government said a unified Germany could be part of the Western
military alliance until a new European security system is formed.
   The Soviet Union opposes NATO membership for a united Germany.
But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl says the merged country must
remain part of the alliance.
   The West German television network ZDF said Wednesday that a
letter from Soviet officials to de Maiziere outlined Moscow's
opposition to quick unification because it would lead to rapid
integration into NATO.
   De Maiziere favors a form of unification in which the West
German constitution would become the constitution of East Germany.
Some German politicans in both states favor a slower pace that
would require a new constitution to be written.

   A teachers strike that has closed hundreds
of schools since Monday entered its fourth day today with
Oklahoma's Senate struggling to forge a compromise to end a
deadlock on education spending.
   Organizers said they expected their largest demonstration of the
week at the Capitol this afternoon, in part because teachers from
Oklahoma City, the state's second-largest school district, and
Lawton, the third-largest, are joining the strike for the day.
   At least 12,000 teachers, parents and students picketed at the
Capitol on Wednesday. Elsewhere, students staged walkouts at their
open schools.
   Teachers are demanding more pay and higher school spending.
Their 31,000-member union, the Oklahoma Education Association, says
Oklahoma teachers rank 48th in pay among the states, making $22,000
a year, compared with the national average of $29,648.
   ``We've waited long enough,'' was the message on stickers worn
by many of the teachers, referring to an 8-month-old special
session and the failure of the Legislature to enact a $230 million
school reform and tax bill.
   The bill stalled in the Senatthers have been met in part, officials
said Thursday.

<HEAD>Studio Bidding Leads to Record Price for Screenplay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A film script about a private eye who joins
forces with a former football star to solve a murder sold for a
record $1.75 million.
   ``The Last Boy Scout'' could have fetched $2 million, but
28-year-old screenwriter Shane Black said he preferred to sign with
the David Geffen Co., an independent producer he worked with
previously.
   It's become almost routine to ask $1 million for prized
screenplays in recent months. But industry executives said
Tuesday's sale price far exceeded previous highs.
   Black, who wrote ``Lethal Weapon,'' declined to comment on his
latest sale.
   Geffen, who produced ``Beetlejuice,'' said he wanted the script
because, ``I can see a movie in it. It's not maybe a movie. It's
definitely a movie, and those aren't easy to find.''
   A bidding war has broken out during the past year for ``spec
scripts,'' screenplays written without having been commissioned by
a producer or studio.
   The boom, fed in part by a push by 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney
Co. and Columbia Pictures to expand their slates, ended the
$300,000 benchmark price for top scripts barely a year ago.
   Black's script apparently attracted the studios because it is
action-oriented and crafted well enough to lure a prominent
director and actors, and it promises to launch sequels.
   Fox opened the bidding at $850,000 on Monday, the Los Angeles
Times reported Thursday. Universal Pictures dropped out when the
price topped $1 million, while Warner Bros. and a partnership
between Tri-Star and Carolco Pictures continued in pursuit.
   The partnership had bid $2 million by late Tuesday before Black
chose Geffen, the Times said.
   Some studio executives say script auctioning has become too
costly.
   ``To get $1 million, it used to have to be a damned good script.
Now, you practically pay that for the idea alone and wind up with a
lot of rewrites,'' said David Hoberman, head of Disney's Touchstone
unit, which has stayed out of the auctions.
   Others like the change.
   ``I don't know of anything that generates the excitement of the
chase after a big script,'' said John Goldwyn, executive vice
president of worldwide production at MGM-UA Communications Co.
   Screenwriters increasingly are auctioning their work as the
studios turn away from the development process, in which executives
pay writers to write and rewrite ideas discussed in advance.
   About 83 percent of Hollywood scripts sold last year were made
by the development process, down from 91 percent in 1986, according
to partially complete figures from the Writers Guild of America
West.

   Mayor David N. Dinkins, long active in the
anti-apartheid movement, has substantial savings accounts at a bank
that does business with South Africa, New York Newsday reported
Thursday.
   The 1989 tax return filed jointly by the mayor and his wife,
Joyce, shows $7,284 in interest from four separate accounts at
Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Co., the newspaper said.
   Manufacturer's Hanover not only has renewed loans to South
Africa, but is one of two U.S. banks on the committee of creditors
that renegotiates South Africa's foreign debt.
   Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, has strongly supported
laws forbidding the city from depositing money in banks that do
business with South Africa.
   Apparently the mayor was unaware of Manufacturer's South African
ties, Newsday said.
   Albert Scardino, Dinkins' spokesman, said the mayor was planning
to move the accounts by the end of the week for financial as well
as political reasons.

<HEAD>Two Liberal Republics Hold Crucial Free Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's two most liberal
republics hold elections Sunday whose results could jeopardize the
country's fragile federation.
   In Croatia, more than 30 parties are vying for parliamentary
seats in the republic's first multiparty elections in 50 years.
   In Slovenia, a center-right coalition advocating independence
hopes to consolidate power by winning the republic's presidency. It
already won legislative elections.
   The coalition's candidate, Jose Pucznik, faces a tough battle
against Milan Kucan. Kucan is a popular reform Communist who won
44.5 percent of the vote in the first round. Pucnik got 26.6
percent in that vote.
   In Croatia, surveys suggest the Party for Democratic Change _
the reformed Communist party _ is in the lead for the legislature.
But nearly a third of the voters are undecided, according to the
polls.
   If pro-independence forces win in both elections, it could
exacerbate the tension with Serbia that threatens to pull apart the
country. Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two
autonomous regions, simmering with ethnic and ideological tensions.
   Slovenia and Croatia, already pushing for closer ties with the
West, would move further away from the hard-line Communist
leadership of Serbia. It is the largest of Yugoslavia's republics
and the only one besides Montenegro still following a one-party
system.
   Croatia and Slovenia have liberal judiciaries and media, and
their Communist parties no longer consider their supremacy
guaranteed. In hard-line Serbia, there is a strong Communist
influence in the press, judiciary and all other aspects of life.
   Last week, the Communist-dominated Yugoslav military, which has
forged close ties with Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, warned it
would prevent anti-Communist parties in Slovenia and Croatia from
assuming power.
   Franjo Tudjman, leader of the conservative Croatian Democratic
Union, which wants radical reshaping of Yugoslavia, dismissed the
statement as ``irrational and insane.''
   Polls show Tudjman's party in second place behind the reformed
Communists. Under Tudjman's formula, Yugoslavia's republics would
be independent states that would establish relations only if common
interests were involved.
   The reform Communists are more cautious. They say the federation
model is fine for now, but if it fails to reflect the republics'
needs in the future Yugoslavia should become a confederation
without central rule.
   The 66-year-old Tudjman once was the Yugoslav army's youngest
general but later spent almost five years in jail for
``counterrevolutionary activities.'' His bid for power is fueling
the fierce rivalry that has existed between Serbia and Croatia
since Yugoslavia was created in 1918.
   Serbia's Communists brand Tudjman a fascist and a secessionist.
They have orchestrated several rallies of Croatia's 450,000 Serb
minority, which is haunted by memories of mass extermination in the
Croatian puppet state set up by Nazi Germany.
   The Serbs in Croatia seek autonomy from the republic, but all
Croatian parties oppose it.
   Tudjman is predicting victory, but his two main rivals are also
optimistic and appear unwilling to consider establishing a
coalition with him if no party wins a majority.
   Mika Tripalo, a senior member of the Coalition for National
Accord, says Tudjman is ``too extreme'' to win.
   The Coalition embraces five traditional Croatian parties
emerging for the first time since World War II, and almost a dozen
other movements. It has broad support.
   Tripalo wants some change in Yugoslavia's complex multi-regional
system. For instance, he said, Croatia cannot continue to spend
vast sums on poorer regions such as Serbia's strife-torn province
of Kosovo.
   But the Coalition, like the reformed Communists, stops short of
advocating Croatian independence. Both seek greater autonomy for
the republics and a leaner federal government strictly limited to
conducting foreign and defense policies.
   Ivica Racan, the Party of Democratic Change leader who over the
past six months has steered Croatia to a multiparty democracy,
virtually rules out coalition with Tudjman.
   Many voters are skeptical any party has the answer in a key area
_ the economy.
   All want to privatize property nationalized by the Communists
and introduce a market economy. None says exactly how.
   ``All their economic programs are vague, consisting mainly of
wishful thinking about the possibilities of huge infusions of
foreign capital after the vote,'' said economist Tomica Sohinger.
   ``Everybody seems to think that Westerners have nothing better
to do with their money than to give it to us,'' he added.

   Hollywood's plan to send Bugs Bunny and his
friends into the fight against drugs won applause from Congress on
Thursday but also a request for more than just the cartoon special
set to air on national television Saturday.
   ``I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion
activity in which we finally hear from Hollywood and this is the
last shot,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
   ``Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change
anybody's mind who's going to use drugs,'' he said.
   Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee watched a sample of
the 30-minute special, ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue'' and
applauded the effort to reach youngsters.
   ``The most powerful weapon that we know in politics is the
cartoon and we hope that the cartoon will be the most powerful tool
to educate our children,'' said committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr.
   The program tells of Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is
saved with help from Bugs Bunny, the Chipmunks, Daffy Duck,
Garfield, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Slimer,
the Smurfs, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Michaelangelo and
Winnie the Pooh.
   He is also saved from Smoke, a sinister, drug-pushing apparition
whose voice was provided by actor George C. Scott.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presentation, funded
by Ronald McDonald Children's Charities and McDonald's restaurant,
is set to air at 10:30 a.m. Saturday EDT and PDT, 9:30 a.m. CDT and
8:30 MDT. According to latest plans, the cartoon will be aired on
ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and numerous independent stations and cable
outlets.
   Roy Disney, vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co. and head of its
animation department, was executive producer of the program.
   In the program, Michael lives in a pleasant, middle-class
setting where stuffed bears come to life and the Chipmunks sing and
dance while urging Michael to ``say no.''
   Asked about long-range plans, Disney Studios President Richard
Frank said the studios have been working so hard ``to get this
particular special out that we really haven't had time to sit down
and plan other ones.''
   Actually, only 15 minutes of the production were shown to the
lawmakers and some of the music as well as all of the sound effects
were missing. ``What you're going to see is minus those
embellishments,'' Disney explained.
   ``I know what I'm going to be doing Saturday morning,'' Biden
said after the screening. ``I want to hear the music.''

   Visitors to four of the country's most popular
national parks will be asked to recycle glass, plastic and aluminum
trash in a program sponsored by two chemical companies and the
Interior Department.
   Recycling will start next month at Great Smoky Mountains
National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, the first site of
the recycling education program launched by Dow Chemical Co.,
Huntsman Chemical Corp. and the department.
   Acadia in Maine and Grand Canyon in Arizona will be added by
June, with plans to expand the program to California's Yosemite by
fall. Officials said they hoped eventually to add paper to the list
of recycled materials.
   ``It is time to recognize that recycling is a standard of good
citizenship,'' Frank Popoff, chief executive officer of Dow, said
at an open-air news conference near the Lincoln Memorial.
   Bill Snodgrass, recycling project manager with Dow, said the
first four parks were chosen for their volume of visitors _ a
combined total of 18 million to 20 million a year.
   ``It's our best chance to reach the public,'' he said. ``We
think Americans are willing to recycle. When we see people in a
national park, we think their environmental mood has to be
fantastic.''
   Park visitors will find special plastic bins in which to deposit
aluminum, glass and plastic trash. Popoff said it's hoped that
local entrepreneurs will start businesses to collect the materials,
haul them to nearby separation centers and sell them to recyclers.
   Where possible, he said, Dow will arrange to have the recycled
plastics converted and returned to the parks in the form of picnic
tables, park benches, sign posts, guard rails, car stops and other
products.
   Snodgrass said the program will cost the companies $500,000 per
park this year, but the costs will decrease after the first
start-up year. He said about 2 million pounds of recyclable waste
should be recovered in the program's first year.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said recycling has not been
feasible in the past because of inadequate collection systems.
   ``This is an experiment,'' he said of the Dow-Huntsman project.
``We think it will work. We think it's the answer.''
   Both Dow, of Midland, Mich., and Huntsman, of Salt Lake City,
have in-house recycling programs that company officials said save
millions of dollars a year. Popoff said Dow's recycling practices
reduce the company's wastes by 88 million pounds a year and saved
$30 million in 1988.

   Actress-model Lauren Hutton, the gapped-tooth
star of such films as ``American Gigolo,'' filed suit against
fellow actress and friend Beverly D'Angelo for alleging breaking
her leg in a car accident.
   ``It's not like she ran over her on purpose. It was just an
accident, but we wanted to protect the statute (of limitations),''
Hutton attorney Richard Bisetti said Thursday. Such suits must be
filed within a year of an accident.
   The Superior Court suit filed earlier this month against Miss
D'Angelo and Budget Rent A Car seeks an unspecified amount for
medical expenses, loss of earnings and pain and suffering.
   On Aug. 20, Miss D'Angelo was behind the wheel of a rented car
that backed into Miss Hutton, 46, who was waiting to get inside,
Bisetti said.
   ``She was in a cast for almost eight months and they (doctors)
are still concerned about her leg,'' he said.
   Bisetti said Miss D'Angelo and Budget Rent A Car were supposed
to be served with the suit by Friday. Budget owner Arnold Graham
wasn't in the office early Thursday, a receptionist said.

   A state agency has offered Bob Hope $20
million for 5,700 acres of his mountain property to spare the
rugged canyon country from development, an official said.
   Hope has not acted on the proposal by the Santa Monica Mountains
Conservancy, said Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston.
   ``I am optimistic,'' he said Wednesday. ``I think it would be
the most important acquisition that has been made, certainly in the
last 20 years or so, in the whole Santa Monica Mountains zone.''
   Hope has been criticized by environmentalists for moving to sell
his vast holdings in Los Angeles and Ventura counties to developers.
   The proposed agreement would transfer most of Hope's mountain
land to the state and federal governments.
   The area would serve as part of a migratory wildlife corridor
for animal populations in the Santa Monica and Santa Susana
mountains.
   The 86-year-old comedian has endured negative publicity in
recent months over his sale of mountain lands to prospective
developers and his refusal to consider giving or selling the land
to park agencies.
   Hope's publicist Frank Lieberman said the entertainer had no
comment regarding the proposed sale.

   2 Live Crew members were as nasty as
they wanted to be early Thursday as they performed in a nightclub
despite threats of arrests on obscenity charges.
   The nightclub Central City was packed to its 1,500-person
capacity when the group opened with a song called ``Martinez Rap,''
about Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's campaign against the group's
graphic lyrics.
   The band, whose album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' has been
banned in several Florida counties, began its performance at
midnight and concluded about 1:30 a.m.
   ``Arrests? Not by this department,'' said a duty officer at
Gainesville police headquarters who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``This whole thing, we understand, was being publicized
by the state attorney's office.''
   State attorney Len Register had called some of 2 Live Crew's
sexually explicit songs ``the most filthy thing I've ever
encountered.'' He threatened to have the band arrested if they
played uncensored versions of songs such as ``Me So Horny,'' and
``Move Somethin,'' which has lyrics referring to sadomasochistic
sex and violence against women.
   Register's office said Thursday he was in meetings and would not
be available for comment.
   Debbie Bennett, spokeswoman for the group in Miami, said it
played its usual concert. The group had an attorney on hand and
bail money available if Register had followed up on his threat, she
said.
   The Miami-based group is led by Luther ``Luke Skyywalker''
Campbell. Members are David ``Mr. Mixx'' Hobbs, Chris ``Fresh Ice
Kid'' Won Wong and Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross.

   A group purportedly acting in the name of
religion says it set fire to the office of gospel singer Sandi
Patti because she put herself ``on the pedestal of God.''
   Police said they have never heard of the ``Equal Religious
Coalition'' but they're taking a claim of responsibility for the
fire seriously.
   An unidentified woman professing to be part of the group said
Tuesday's fire was set in the singer's office ``in objection to
Mrs. Patti's blatancy to continue to put herself on the pedestal of
God.''
   The woman made the claim to the Anderson Herald Bulletin, the
newspaper reported Thursday. It said the woman phoned Wednesday and
read a statement.
   ``We are not taking any information too lightly or too
seriously,'' Patti said. ``We are waiting to see how this fits into
the whole scheme of things.''
   The newspaper notified police, and Chief Ron Rheam said he
reviewed the message and is considering it.
   No one was injured when flames destroyed the Helvering Booking
and Management office, operated by Patti's husband, John Helvering.
The office handles mail distribution of Patti's records, tapes and
T-shirts.

   Mrs. Fowler said she adopted the plight of the animals after
living among a herd with her family during her husband's research

   Mutual of Omaha Fund Management, the investment affiliate of the
insurance company, sponsored Wednesday's reception for Mrs. Fowler

20th anniversary of Earth Day.
   Mrs. Fowler formed the Fowler Wildlife Association in New York

the proceeds going to fight the slaughter of elephants.
   ``For my children and my grandchildren, I am committed to doing
all that I can to save this most powerful species from man's
destruction and greed,'' she said.
   The money will help Richard Leakey, director of Kenya's
Department of Wildlife, curb the poaching of elephants for their
tusks, she said. About 2,000 elephants are killed each week, and
about 85 percent of Kenya's elephants have been killed since 1973,
she said, citing Leakey's statistics.

<HEAD>Planned to Leave, but Kidnappers Moved First</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Alann Steen, a journalism teacher who once faced down a grizzly
bear in Alaska, worried about his safety in wartorn Beirut and had
planned to leave.
   Kidnappers acted first. On Jan. 24, 1987, Steen and three other
teachers, two Americans and an Indian with resident alien status in
the United States, were abducted by gunmen masquerading as police.
   Steen, 50, had been in the Lebanese capital since 1983, when he
surprised friends by taking a job at Beirut University College.
   ``When he said he was leaving for Lebanon, we were very
surprised that he would make that decision, and people here tried
very hard to dissuade him,'' said John Sutthoff, a fellow professor
when Steen was at California's Chico State University.
   During a visit to California in October 1985, Steen told the
weekly Arcata Union he moved to Beirut over the objections of his
second wife, who filed for divorce after a visit.
   His third wife, Virginia Rose Steen, heads the Fine Arts
Department at Beirut University College and witnessed his
kidnapping. They were married in July 1986.
   Howard Seemann, a former colleague at Humboldt State University
in Arcata, said Steen indicated in a 1986 letter he would be
spending only one more year in Beirut because it had become too
dangerous.
   Seemann said Steen was nervous walking Beirut's streets because
his fair complexion made him easy to identify as a Westerner. He
moved back to the campus from a downtown apartment, where he kept a
pistol under his pillow and an automatic rifle in his closet,
Seeman said.
   Steen was an editor at the Arcata Union before becoming a
journalism teacher, off and on, between 1970 and 1981 at Humboldt
State University and at Chico State in 1981-83.
   He also wrote free-lance articles. In ``Grizzly in No-Man's
Land,'' a feature in the magazine ``Outdoor Life'' in February
1979, Steen wrote about an encounter with a bear during a solo
backpacking and kayaking trip in Alaska.
   Steen was born in Boston April 22, 1939. He served with the
Marines in the Far East during the Vietnam War, according to
Humboldt State personnel records, but his daughter Becky said he
never saw combat.
   He graduated from Humboldt State in 1969 with a journalism major
and later received a master's degree in English and journalism from
that school.
   Seemann described Steen as ``the good American, the opposite of
the ugly American ... very relaxed, patient and pleasant.''

   Robert Polhill visited Beirut on business trips for an
accounting firm and fell in love with the country, his mother
recalled.
   He returned as an assistant professor of business studies at
Beirut University College. On Jan. 24, 1987, he and three other
academics were kidnapped by gunmen posing as policemen.
   Polhill, 55, had lived in Lebanon for four years with his second
wife, Ferial, who is Lebanese.
   His mother, Ruth Polhill, a retired high school librarian who
resides in Fishkill, N.Y., said her son visited Lebanon on one of
his first business trips for a New York City accounting firm.
   ``It was very beautiful,'' she recalled. ``He loved the people.
He loved the campus.''
   Polhill, a diabetic who requires daily medication, attended
Cornell University and graduated from New York University in 1961,
after which he began work as a New York accountant. He was
described as a photography buff, an avid New York Giants fan and a
committed educator.
   ``We are a family that's been touched by teaching,'' said
Polhill's aunt, Lois Bird of East Rochester, N.Y.
   Polhill had two children from a previous marriage _ Steven, of
New York City and Brian, a student at the State University of New
York at Binghamton.
   His mother said he told her he was not fearful living on the
Beirut campus. ``Now that's what he tells his mother,'' she said.
``He had all the confidence he's be safe on the Beirut campus.''
   Said son Brian: ``We knew it (kidnapping) was a possibility, but
it wasn't something he put a big accent on. He was extremely
careful. He kept a low profile.''

   Jesse Jonathan ``Jon'' Turner, one of four Beirut University
College staff members taken hostage Jan. 24, 1987, stayed in
Lebanon to help the college's students get the education they
needed, his former wife says.
   Ina Clare Turner of Moscow, Idaho, said that feeling of
responsibility was common among faculty members at the college.
   ``They all loved BUC as much as Jon does,'' she said. ``Very
assuredly I would say they were all there because they wanted to be
there.''
   Turner, 42, an associate professor of mathematics and computer
science at the Beirut campus, was abducted with three other
academics, two Americans and an Indian, by men posing as police
assigned to protect the college staff.
   ``He was told the campus was secure,'' said Turner's mother,
Estelle Ronnenburg of Boise, Idaho. ``The Lebanese police guarded
it, along with student police. The college was fenced all the way
around.'''
   Mrs. Ronneburg said her son, who married a Lebanese woman, had
integrated well with the people in Beirut.
   ``He had many friends over there and came to be highly thought
of,'' she said.
   Turner graduated from Boise High School and received an
undergraduate degree in psychology from Boise State University in
1970 and three graduate degrees from the University of Idaho _
master's degrees in philosophy and mathematics, and a doctorate in
mathematics.
   Mrs. Ronneburg said he moved to Beirut from Hawaii in 1983.
   During the 18 months she spent in Beirut, Ina Clare Turner said,
fighting outside the closed campus forced the couple and other
faculty members to seek refuge in a basement shelter.
   The stays would last from four hours to three days and the
shelter, a radio-television classroom in better times, was
furnished with foam mattresses.
   ``When we went down there we would take bottles of water,
oranges to eat and books to read. Whenever we heard there was
trouble, we would go down to the shelter and wait it out,'' she
said.
   Turner's second wife, Badr, gave birth to a daughter, Joanne, on
July 24, 1987, five months after he was kidnapped.

   The White House said today it had
dispatched a hostage reception team to Wiesbaden, West Germany
after hearing ``statements of imminent release'' of an American
hostage in Lebanon.
   But pro-Iranian kidnappers in Beirut said they have postponed
the release because the United States failed to meet their demand
to send a senior State Department official to Syria.
   The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture
of Robert Polhill, one of three U.S. educators held by the group
since Jan. 24, 1987.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the release
statements came from both the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, which is holding several American hostages, and from
Syria.
   ``We're hopeful this could be real,'' Fitzwater said as the
president flew to Florida for a meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Fitzwater said the State Department had dispatched a reception
team to Wiesbaden, ``where they have the medical facilities to
receive any hostage that might be released.''
   ``We have statements of imminent release from Islamic Jihad and
from Syria,'' Fitzwater told reporters. But, he cautioned,
``there's no way for us to know conclusively that it's going to
happen.''
   He said the hostage reception team has been sent there before on
rumors of a hostage release that never happened.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said on
Wednesday it would release one hostage this week. It did not
identify the hostage, but the statement was accompanied by an
instant photograph of Jesse Turner of Boise, Idaho. The group also
holds Alann Steen and Robert Polhill.
   Fitzwater said the Syrian government sent word through
diplomatic channels Wednesday that it appears a hostage would be
released. ``It is a little more significant that we have a
statement from the Syrian government, but it by no means makes it a
certainty,'' he said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
the message from Syria was the first official word to the U.S.
government that a hostage may be released.
   She also ruled out any ``deals'' and said the United States had
had no contact with Iran, directly or indirectly, about the captive
Americans.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador
Damascus, had returned to his post in Syria after attending a
meeting of U.S. diplomats in Bonn, West Germany. She said Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly, who also attended, did not plan to
goto Syria, as demanded by the Islamic Jihad.
   Eight Americans are among the Western hostages held in Lebanon
by pro-Iranian groups. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Turner, Steen and Polhill were taken from the campus of Beirut
University College in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Asked if the administration was concerned that sending Kelly to
Damascus might be viewed as negotiating with terrorists, Fitzwater
said, ``we certainly don't want any question about negotiations to
be raised by his going.''
   ``Our position is that we want the unconditional release of all
hostages. We will not deal or negotiate for hostage release but
we're hopeful this could be real,'' Fitzwater said.

   Childbirth can be a trial, and it can
even happen at a trial.
   Jacqueline Jamerson, 24, had her son minutes Wednesday after she
walked out of District Judge John Ballard's courtroom complaining
of labor pains. She was taken to an adjacent courtroom where she
gave birth with the help of a fire department ambulance crew.
   A jury had been picked to hear drug charges against Ms. Jamerson
when defense attorney Michael Walker told the judge his client was
experiencing ``discomfort.''
   The defendant's friend Ester Johnson said Ms. Jamerson
complained of being uncomfortable, but assumed it was because she
had been sitting on a wooden chair for three days of jury selection.
   ``I told her she might be going into labor, but she said it was
only a few pains,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``She handled this pretty
well.''
   Ms. Johnson, however, said she almost panicked watching the
delivery. ``That baby was a real screamer.''
   Mother and son were listed in good condition at the LSU Medical
Center.
   Jurors were told Thursday to go home for the weekend.
   Jamerson, her former boyfriend Gerald ``Itty-Bitty'' Kennedy,
30, are charged with possessing about 2 pounds of cocaine.
   Jamerson's attorneys said they will ask for a mistrial.

<TEXT>
   A $50,000 annual Abraham Lincoln Prize has
been established to stimulate scholarship into Lincoln's presidency
and the Civil War era, sponsors of the award announced Thursday.
   The prize, said by its sponsors to be by far the largest ever
offered in the field of American history, will be awarded annually
to a scholarly work _ deemed to be the finest of the year _ dealing
with Lincoln, Civil War soldiers or related subjects.
   The award will be administered by Gettysburg College and will be
presented at its Pennsylvania campus each year on Lincoln's
birthday, beginning on Feb. 12, 1991.
   Funds for the award were donated by New York financiers Lewis E.
Lehrman and Richard Gilder Jr.
   Lehrman, a former unsuccessful Republican candidate for
governor, is a managing director of the investment banking firm of
Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. Gilder is president of Gilder, Gagnon &amp; Co.,
a Wall Street stock brokerage.
   The announcement of the founding of the award was made in a
ceremony at the National Portrait Gallery in a hall used by Lincoln
125 years ago to celebrate his second inaugural. A portrait of
Lincoln hangs around the corner from where the announcement was
made.
   Gabor S. Boritt, professor of civil war studies at Gettysburg
College, said founders anticipate the Lincoln Prize will usually be
awarded to the author of a work of history, generally a book.
   But he said an important article or essay or even works of
fiction, poetry, the theatre, the arts or film might be considered,
``provided they show high fidelity to history.''
   The jurors for the 1990 Lincoln Prize will be Robert V. Bruce,
professor emeritus of history at Boston University; James M.
McPherson, professor of history at Princeton University and winner
of the Pulitzer Prize for his 1988 Civil War history, ``Battle Cry
of Freedom''; and Tom Wicker, a columnist for The New York Times
whose 1984 novel, ``Unto This Hour,'' dealt with the Civil War
battle of Second Manassas.

   Cervical cancer deaths have dropped 11 percent in
seven years, but the death rates for black women remain more than
twice as high as those for white women, federal cancer specialists
reported Thursday.
   The racial disparity is ``substantial and persistent,'' the
Centers for Disease Control reported, though black women may have
surpassed white women in getting cervical cancer screening.
   U.S. deaths from cervical cancer dropped from 5,537 in 1980 to
4,951 in 1987, the latest year for which detailed analysis is
available, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``That's primarily from the increased use of screening,'' said
CDC cancer researcher Eddas Bennett. Virtually all cervical cancer
deaths are preventable with early detection _ chiefly through Pap
test screening _ and treatment when necessary, the CDC said.
   Overall, annual cervical cancer death rates declined from 4.2
deaths per 100,000 women in 1980, to 3.4 in 1987. But while the
rate among black women fell from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1980 to 7.6 in
1987, it remains more than twice the white rate, which dropped from
3.6 to 2.9.
   The CDC attributed the racial disparity in death rates to
generally lower socio-economic status among blacks, as well as a
higher incidence rate of cervical cancer, regardless of outcome.
   Preliminary CDC reports indicate that black women actually are
more likely than whites to undergo cancer-screening Pap smears.
   ``A higher proportion of black women ... report having been
screened,'' the CDC said, citing an unpublished study whose details
are not yet publicly available.
   Lower screening rates for black women in previous years may be
contributing now to higher death rates in older black women,
Bennett said.
   ``Previously, black women were screened less frequently than
white women, and it takes some years for it to catch up,'' she said.
   But ``for younger black women who were screened more frequently
than their white counterparts, disparities in follow-up and
treatment may have contributed to excess cervical cancer
mortality,'' the CDC said.
   ``If you're screened, it often comes down to a question of
whether you actually received the appropriate follow-up,'' Bennett
said.

<TEXT>
   The Solidarity trade union under the gavel
of chairman Lech Walesa launched its second national congress
Thursday, celebrating its past triumphs while facing deep questions
about its future.
   In an emotional opening speech, Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki invoked the memory of the union's long, painful struggle
to survive after the shock of martial law in 1981.
   ``Solidarity is alive. Poland is alive, free and independent,''
proclaimed the prime minister, interrupted by cheers from the 487
delegates.
   Walesa looked more to the future.
   ``Solidarity has had great achievements, but expectations are
even higher and we have to live up to them,'' he told the congress
before turning control of the meeting over to a 10-member presidium.
   The scheduled six-day meeting takes place in the same Olivia
sports hall where the union met for 18 stormy days in September and
October 1981.
   Communist authorities declared military rule to crush Solidarity
only two months later, forcing the union into an eight-year battle
to regain legal status and worker rights.
   The union finally triumphed at talks one year ago, leading to
the swift toppling of Communist rule after elections in June.
Within months, Communist monopolies were broken in the five other
East bloc countries.
   Solidarity now faces new difficulties.
   The union has managed to regain only 2.2 million of the 10
million members it had in 1981. Opinion polls show confidence in
Solidarity dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships
associated with the strict austerity program pursued by
Mazowiecki's Solidarity-created government.
   Economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising
joblessness among the industrial workers who are the backbone of
Solidarity's support.
   Walesa, meanwhile, has criticized the pace of political reforms,
saying Mazowiecki's team is not moving quickly enough to dislodge
Communists from power in state-owned enterprises and government
ministries.
   Before a backdrop upon which the red union ``Solidarnosc'' logo
was silk-screened, Walesa stood alone on the dais Thursday morning
and pounded his gavel three times to bring the congress to order.
   Delegates and hundreds of international guests and observers
applauded, with some union members raising their arms in the
traditional Solidarity V-for-victory sign.
   A symbolic procession of workers _ including black-uniformed
miners in tall feathered caps and shipyard workers in blue
worksuits and yellow hardhats _ took up positions on the side of
the hall.
   After leading the singing of the national anthem, Walesa
announced that the congress had ended the underground and
provisional phase of the union's activity.
   He asked for a moment of silence ``for the people who died that
we might live a dignified life.''
   During the congress, the union will elect new leaders and accept
a program for the future.
   Walesa appeared all but certain to win another term as chairman,
but rumors circulated that he would be challenged.
   At least one Solidarity region, Upper Silesia, is on record as
proposing alternative candidates.
   A draft prepared for the congress urges Solidarity to
concentrate more on traditional union issues, while not resigning
entirely from being a broad-based political movement.
   One option to be discussed is creation of a separate Solidarity
political party.
   The congress' first day was mainly given over to ceremony,
procedural details and speeches from invited guests such as
Mazowiecki.
   The prime minister, whose economic policies are likely to come
under harsh criticism at the congress, stressed his roots in
Solidarity in an emotional speech to the congress.
   ``I am one of you. I remain one of you,'' he said. ``I want to
remain faithful to this.''
   While acknowledging the ``difficult, painful problems that have
appeared _ unemployment, hard living conditions,'' Mazowiecki
called attention to signs of success for his economic policies,
including ``smothering of inflation (and) more goods in stores.''
   He said entirely free local elections scheduled across Poland on
May 27 will have a profound effect in increasing democracy in
Poland.
   Today, he concluded:
   ``We can say we have won this fight against totalitarianism and
we shall will this fight for democracy.''
   As Mazowiecki stepped away from the podium, half the hall stood
to applaud. The other half remained seated until a smiling Walesa
went over to vigorously shake the prime minister's hand.

<HEAD>U.S. Safety Investigators Want More Access To Cruise Ships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's chief accident investigator asked
on Thursday for more power to examine mishaps on cruise ships that
sail under foreign flags but work out of U.S. ports and carry
mostly Americans.
   Complaining that international owners have thwarted efforts at
investigating offshore accidents involving foreign-flag cruise
ships, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman James L.
Kolstad encouraged Congress to expand the powers of U.S.
authorities.
   ``Had the Scandinavian Star been carrying hundreds of U.S.
passengers off the Florida coast instead of Europeans in the North
Sea, neither the National Transportation Safety Board nor the U.S.
Coast Guard would have been able to investigate this accident
without the owner's permission,'' Kolstad said.
   Kolstad was referring to the shipboard fire a more than a week
ago in the North Sea in which more than 160 people died.
   The NTSB had investigated a major fire aboard the same ship two
years ago in the Gulf of Mexico and ``identified some of the very
problem areas survivors have reported this past week,'' he told the
House merchant marine subcommittee.
   Kolstad pointed to another thwarted effort at an offshore
investigation: the February 1989 collision between the Celebration,
owned by Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines and operating under
Liberian registry, and a Cuban bulk carrier.
   Not only cruise ships, but also cargo ships operate under
so-called ``flags of convenience'' such as those of Panama or
Liberia, allowing them to avoid higher taxes and wages. The ``flag
state'' rules govern the ship on the high seas, while ``port
state'' rules govern it within the port state's territory.
   But Kolstad and members of Congress say the burgeoning cruise
industry has exploited the law of the seas. Critics say the
businesses are American in everything except flag, and many ships
go on short excursions known as ``cruises to nowhere'' to escape
onshore gambling laws.
   Unions are using the same argument to push for putting the crews
of these ships under jurisdiction of U.S. labor law.
   Opponents say that U.S. efforts to extend regulation would
violate long-established international law and would drive cruise
operators to base their ships in the Bahamas and offer cheap
fly-and-cruise packages.
   Kolstad argued that the international mechanism for addressing
safety issues and accident investigations is too slow and
cumbersome.
   The United States is host nation to more than 80 percent of the
world's large passenger vessels, some now capable of carrying 2,600
passengers.
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Joel D. Sipes disputed Kolstad's
assertions about the lack of international cooperation and said his
agency prefers working within international agreements.
   ``That is the experience that NTSB has had that we have not,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian kidnappers said Thursday they
postponed indefinitely the release of an American hostage because
the United States refused to send a senior State Department
official to Syria.
   The announcement came in an Arabic-language statement delivered
by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. It was delivered
to the independent Beirut newspaper an-Nahar and a Western news
agency.
   The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture
of Robert Polhill, one of U.S. educators held by the group since
Jan. 24, 1987.
   The kidnappers on Wednesday said John Kelly, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, should fly to Damascus
``to coordinate some final steps to guarantee success within 48
hours.'' They said a hostage would be freed within that time frame.
   The White House refused to dispatch Kelly. Doing so would either
have engaged the United States in negotiations over the hostages or
given that appearance, a senior U.S. official explained Wednesday
night.
   The group's statement Thursday reiterated the demand that Kelly
be sent to Damascus.
   ``As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and
finalized,'' the statement said.
   ``But Kelly's failure to respond has so far frustrated the
release, which made us postpone this operation until the picture is
cleared,'' it added.
   The kidnappers said Wednesday they were freeing one of the three
Americans in response to requests from Iran and Syria, whose
leaders have encouraged an end to the hostage crisis. The group
implied that some sort of exchange was involved.
   On Thursday morning, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the United States had dispatched a hostage reception team to West
Germany after hearing ``statements of imminent release'' of an
American hostage.
   The group did not say which of the three would be freed, only
that the release would occur within 48 hours _ or by Friday evening.
   That statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of Jesse
Turner of Boise, Idaho _ the first photo of him alone since three
months after his abduction. The group also holds Alann Steen.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner were abducted from the campus of
Beirut University College on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Turner, 42, taught mathematics and computer science at Beirut
University. Polhill, 55, of New York, was a lecturer in accounting.
Steen, a journalism professor born in Arcata, Calif., and a former
resident of Boston, turns 51 Sunday.
   Eight Americans are among the Western hostages held in Lebanon
by pro-Iranian groups. The longest-held is 42-year-old Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Police Find Body Entombed in Concrete</HEAD>

   A body encased in concrete was
discovered Thursday by police using sledgehammers after a woman
told them she could no longer live with the secret of the man's
death, authorities said.
   Elaine LaDolce told police the man had died Nov. 7 after her
boyfriend, Paul Garland, gave him a bath in scalding water, said
Police Capt. Gabriel DiBernardo.
   The victim, in his mid-30s, shared the house with Garland and
LaDolce in this city 10 miles north of Buffalo, authorities said.
His name was withheld until relatives were notified.
   Police said they were trying to find the 40-year-old Garland for
question him. Authorities had not decided what, if any, charges to
file.
   The police captain said Garland had threatened to kill LaDolce
if she told anyone about the death, but she went to police late
Wednesday after fighting with him and deciding she ``could no
longer live with the terrible secret.'' She told detectives Garland
had complained about the man's smell and ordered him into the
bathtub while he boiled water on the kitchen stove, DiBernardo said.
   LaDolce said she did not see what happened in the bathroom, but
heard the man's screams after Garland took in the scalding water,
DiBernardo said. The screams stopped and Garland emerged from the
bathroom saying ``something was wrong, that his friend wasn't
breathing,'' the detective said.
   Garland dressed the body and dragged it downstairs, LaDolce told
police. He allegedly tried to dig a grave in the basement but
couldn't break through the floor, so he built a wooden vault around
the body and encased the whole thing in concrete, DiBernardo said.
   It took detectives four hours to break through the concrete, he
said.

   The Democratic-controlled House Budget
Committee on Thursday approved a plan to slash President Bush's
defense spending proposal and shift billions of dollars to domestic
programs.
   The $1.24 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 was approved on a
21-14 party-line vote. Debate in the full House was scheduled for
next week.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said there was
``good common sense'' behind the Democratic version of the fiscal
1991 budget. He described it as ``a sharp departure from the status
quo.''
   Republicans portrayed the plan as an embodiment of the same old
liberal Democratic priorities, with irresponsible defense cuts and
loose reins on domestic spending. But they expressed little
concern, calling the committee action just an early step in the
long budget process.
   ``We believe the sooner we get this exercise over the sooner ...
we can actually begin writing the bill'' in bipartisan talks
involving the president, said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,
senior Republican on the committee.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president had ``no plans for a summit at this time'' on the budget.
   The Democratic budget envisions $295 billion in military
spending next year, about $1 billion less than in the current year
and $8 billion less than requested by Bush.
   Three-fourths of the defense savings would be shifted
immediately into domestic accounts that include Medicaid, food
stamps, education, AIDS and anti-drug abuse programs.
   Liberals on the committee failed Thursday in their attempt to
cut defense spending even further next year. However, they said
they were satisfied with the long-term blueprint in the budget for
squeezing the Pentagon by 25 percent over the next five years.
   The Democratic budget is structured to force the Pentagon to
abandon procurement of expensive weapons systems. Although it
avoids specifics, the B-2 stealth bomber is an obvious target.
   The long-term focus also would help Congress avert troop
cutbacks before the November election.
   The Senate Budget Committee was scheduled to begin its
budget-drafting next week. Its chairman, Sen. James Sasser,
D-Tenn., has suggested military spending be cut even more deeply
next year than it would under the House plan.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has
balked at that suggestion.
   ``The Democratic (defense cut) proposal in the House is higher
than mine would be but it is within the range of responsibility,''
Nunn said Thursday. He said he would submit his own figures late
this week or early next week.
   He proposed Thursday that U.S. troop strength in Europe should
be cut well below the 225,000 baseline proposed by Bush.
   ``We should start planning on a residual force in Europe on the
order of 75,000 to 100,000 troops within five years,'' he said in a
speech.
   In the House committee Thursday, Democrats describe their fiscal
blueprint as a turning point.
   ``It recognizes the realities of a changing world in which our
leadership will be tested not by the threat of nuclear war but by
the challenge of reversing a legacy of debt and unmet needs within
our society,'' said budget committee chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   ``The defense number is the fulcrum of the budget,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Republicans, he said, wanted to maintain it ``to fight the last
war. The new war we must fight is the economic war.''
   But Republicans and some Democrats criticized the plan for
adding new domestic spending when federal deficits are still in the
$100 billion a year range.
   ``If you liked the Dukakis economic program, you'll love this
budget,'' said Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky.
   ``The defense number ... is scary,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La.
   Why couldn't the ``peace dividend'' from defense cuts be
translated into ``a deficit reduction dividend or a tax reduction
dividend?'' asked Rep. Bill Schuette, R-Mich.
   Schuette also voted against Bush's budget when it was defeated
in committee when offered as a substitute to the Democratic plan.
   The Democratic budget envisions $13.9 billion in new taxes next
year, the same amount requested by Bush in his budget. The plan
does not specify where those revenues might be found, and like Bush
the word ``taxes'' is avoided.
   The taxes help the plan achieve its goal of reducing the federal
deficit by about $36 billion next year. The government's red ink
would be reduced to about $64 billion as figured under the
Gramm-Rudman budget law.
   Those figures include the surplus in the Social Security trust
fund as part of the government's revenue stream. But Panetta said
that even if that influx wasn't counted, his committee's plan would
balance the budget by fiscal 1995.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, called Thursday for a bipartisan budget
summit to develop a major, long-term plan to restore fiscal balance.
   Panetta sought to put the onus on the Bush.
   ``It would be in the best interest of the country if the
president and the Congress worked together to resolve their
differences and develop a strong deficit reduction package,'' he
said.
   ``In the absence of that kind of cooperation, however, the
budget committee must proceed with the budget process.''

   Syrian soldiers tamed street battles
between rival Shiite militiamen Thursday after four hours of
fighting left four people dead and 10 wounded, police said.
   The Syrians apparently were dispatched to prevent clashes from
hindering the promised release of an American hostage held by a
pro-Iranian group. Later in the day, however, the group announced
the release had been postponed.
   The group, Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
released a statement saying that the release of one of three
American educators had been delayed by the United States' refusal
to send a senior State Department official to Syria. The three
Americans were seized Jan. 24, 1987.
   Also Thursday, Israeli warplanes twice raided a tunnel complex
used by Syrian-backed Palestinian guerrillas near a seaside village
south of Beirut. Two people were wounded.
   The raids were launched three days after guerrillas in southern
Lebanon fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. They exploded
in a field and caused no casualties.
   The Syrian soldiers moved into the capital's western and
southern zones to separate gunmen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal militia. About 12,500
Syrian troops are stationed in Beirut's Moslem sector as a
peacekeeping force.
   The fighting had raised fears that it could jeopardize the
hostage's release. Most of the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon,
including eight Americans, are believed held by groups linked to
Hezbollah in the southern slums, a Shiite stronghold.
   ``Tension resulting from intra-Shiite clashes could block
efforts to release a hostage,'' a police spokesman said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``The Syrian command is obviously keen
on facilitating a hostage release.''
   The appearance of Syrian patrols armed with automatic weapons,
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades ended four hours of
clashes between the rival factions.
   For more than two years the two groups have fought sporadically
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect.
   The fighting flared after Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine issued its statement Wednesday saying that it would
release a hostage within 48 hours.
   The kidnappers said the release would be in response to requests
from Iran and Syria, whose leaders have sought to end the hostage
crisis. Hostages freed in Beirut are usually taken by the Syrians
to Damascus, where they are handed to representatives of their
governments.
   The kidnappers' statement Wednesday did not name the hostage to
be released. It was accompanied by a photograph of captive Jesse
Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho.
   Turner, a professor of mathematics and computer science, was
kidnapped with three colleagues from the U.S.-affiliated Beirut
University College campus Jan. 24, 1987. One of the educators,
Nithileshwar Singh, was freed Oct. 3, 1988.
   The group also still holds journalism professor Alann Steen of
Boston, who turns 51 Sunday, and Robert Polhill, 55, an accounting
lecturer from New York.
   The hostage held the longest in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized
March 16, 1985.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine threatened March
15 to kill its three hostages unless the United States met
unspecified demands. It also threatened to attack airlines flying
Soviet Jewish emigrants to Israel.
   The group previously offered to trade the professors for 400
Arab inmates held in Israel. The Israelis rejected the swap.
   The last American hostage released in Lebanon was David
Jacobsen, former director of the American University Hospital in
Beirut. He was kidnapped May 28, 1985, by another pro-Iranian
Shiite group, Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. He was freed Nov.
2, 1986, under a clandestine arms-for-hostages deal between
Washington and Tehran.
   Singh is an Indian citizen who was a U.S. resident.
   In addition to the eight Americans, four Britons, two Swiss, two
West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian are missing in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Math, Science Education Needs More Money, Senate Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists and teachers complained before a
Senate panel Thursday that a bill created to boost math and science
achievement fails to put enough money behind the ambitious goals.
   ``The money is minuscule compared to the problem,'' Charles
Hollister, marine geologist and vice president of an oceanographic
center in Woods Hole, Mass., told the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   ``None of us really can get too excited about cranking up our
enthusiasm for something that's so small.''
   The bill, the Excellence in Mathematics, Science and Engineering
Education Act, recently was introduced by Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., to help reach the national
education goal of making America No. 1 in math and science by the
year 2000.
   About $125 million would be pumped in increments of a few
million dollars into wide-ranging programs designed to tackle a
variety of problems in the disciplines, as well as provide
incentives to minorities and women.
   Hollister explained it takes as much as $30,000 a year to train
a graduate student _ ``just for stipend alone.'' When the research
costs are added in, ``it's between $250,000 to $500,000, just for
one doctoral student.
   ``My sense of the bill is (that) the blueprint is pretty good. I
was alarmed at the low numbers. I don't think you could possibly
have an impact with $2 million to $3 million with today's money,
especially with the goal being what it is,'' he said, estimating
the appropriation should be ``closer to $1 billion.''
   Shirley Malcom of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science agreed that ``the size of the authorization is not on a
scale with the size of the problem.''
   ``Even if we assume that programs can be devised that have
higher leverage over state, local and private funds as well as the
voluntary efforts of thousands, the level of support currently
proposed is not in keeping with the scale of the problem,'' said
Ms. Malcom.
   Hans Andersen, president of the National Science Teachers
Association, said the bill should double to about $10 million the
amount slated to assess student achievement in each of the programs.

   The State Department called on Israelis on
Thursday to choose a government ``capable of saying yes'' to U.S.
proposals for negotiations with Palestinian Arabs.
   ``It's our view that progress at this point depends on the
emergence of a government that is capable of making decisions and
willing to move forward on peace,'' spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said.
   The statement reflected barely concealed resentment that Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir had not pushed through a formula by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for negotiations.
   Israel has been in the throes of trying to form a new government
to replace the ruling coalition, headed by Shamir, that fell apart
over the Baker plan.
   Shamir objected to provisions for participation in the
negotiations by Palestinians expelled from the West Bank or having
had homes there.
   ``The U.S. has worked very hard to move the peace process
forward,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, reading from a prepared statement.
``We have made important progress by getting to the point where
Palestinians from the territories were prepared to engage in a
dialogue with Israel about elections.''
   The U.S. official added: ``What is needed now to get to such a
dialogue is for an Israeli government to emerge that is capable of
saying yes to the proposals put forward by Secretary Baker.''
   Jerusalem said the statement, portions of which were given to
Israeli reporters on Wednesday, was improper.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud said U.S.-Israeli
relations were ``characterized by a long tradition of
non-interference in internal political processes.''
   ``The process of forming a new government is currently under way
in Israel. It is therefore to be expected that another country, be
it as friendly as it may be, will not interfere,'' he added.
   Shamir, who remains prime minister in a caretaker government,
was asked by reporters in Jerusalem if he would accept the Baker
formula. ``It is self-understood that I cannot say this,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Thursday that
a Senate resolution recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital has
damaged Middle East peace efforts and is an example of increasingly
hasty actions by the chamber on sensitive matters.
   ``These kinds of resolutions, hastily prepared and even more
hastily passed, are nonsense _ dangerous nonsense, and we ought to
do something about it,'' said Dole, who was one of 84 sponsors of
the measure that was approved in March.
   The State Department, meanwhile, took another slap at the
continuing settlement of Jews on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Ms. Tutwiler said it was ``disappointing that a leadership that
was not prepared to go forward on peace would be prepared to take
steps on settlements, which in our view make it more difficult to
develop a meaningful peace process.''
   At the same time, the State Department praised a ruling by an
Israeli Court ordering the ouster of Jews who had moved into a
building complex in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem.
   ``We are pleased that the court has so promptly made its
decision,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We believe it would be in the best
interest of reducing tensions for this matter to be concluded as
quickly as possible.''
   However, the State Department declined to follow the lead of the
Carter administration and declare settlements on land held by the
Arabs from 1948 to 1967 to be illegal.
   U.S. policy calls on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and
from Gaza as part of an overall settlement that would involve Arab
recognition of the Jewish state.

   Two-thirds of Americans favor withdrawing far
more U.S. troops from Europe than proposed by President Bush,
according to a poll released Thursday.
   Told that Bush in February proposed cutting U.S. and Soviet
forces in Central Europe to 195,000 soldiers, 52 percent said they
believed each side should go down to 100,000.
   Thirty-two percent favored stopping at Bush's proposed level,
but 14 percent said both sides should cut to zero. Two percent were
undecided.
   The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted between Feb. 19 and
March 2 by Market Strategies Inc., a polling group that works for
Republican political candidates, in collaboration with Americans
Talk Security, a bipartisan research group.
   The poll's margin of error was 3.2 percent.
   The United States currently has 305,000 troops in Europe; the
Soviets have about 600,000.
   In a Senate floor speech Thursday, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the Bush
administration should begin planning for a residual force in Europe
of between 75,000 and 100,000 troops within five years.
   The survey also said Americans see a receding Soviet military
threat. Sixteen percent said the Soviets pose no threat at all to
the United States; 49 percent cited a minor threat, and 33 percent
said the Soviets are still a serious threat. Two years ago, 53
percent of those polled said the Soviets posed a serious threat.

<TEXT>
   Actress Elizabeth Taylor,
hospitalized with pneumonia, was listed as stable Thursday at St.
John's Hospital and Health Center, her publicist said.
   ``She's stable. She's OK. We have nothing else,'' said Lisa Del
Favaro, a Taylor spokeswoman with Chen Sam and Associates public
relations in New York City. Inquiries to the hospital were referred
to Chen Sam.
   Miss Taylor, 58, hospitalized with a sinus infection April 9 at
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, was transferred to St. John's on
Monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia.
   ``She is currently being treated intravenously with antibiotics
and will remain hospitalized,'' Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious
disease specialist treating Miss Taylor, said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Miss Taylor said in the statement: ``I have been advised by my
physician to remain hospitalized and I expect to make a full
recovery.''
   The actress had a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961, the
year she won an Oscar for ``Butterfield 8.'' Doctors performed a
tracheotomy _ inserting an air tube in her windpipe at the neck _
to help her breathe.
   Miss Taylor's health problems started with a fall from a horse
when she was 13 and filming the movie ``National Velvet.'' She has
had back problems ever since.
   In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and pain killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse at the
Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.

   Police arrested five teen-agers and charged them
with starting a fire at a tire dump that burned for 17 days,
spewing toxic smoke into the air and forcing 600 people from their
homes, officials said Thursday.
   The teen-agers, ranging in age from 15 to 17, were arrested
Thursday and late Wednesday, police said. The Young Offenders Act
prohibits disclosing the identitities of those charged.
   The arrests were made after tips from the public, police in
Ontario said on condition of anonymity.
   Investigators had said arson was the cause of the fire at Tyre
King Recycling. The dump is in Hagersville, 12 miles north of Lake
Erie and 60 miles north of Erie, Ohio.
   The fire, fed by 14 million tires, broke out early Feb. 12,
forcing the evacuation of hundreds living in a two-mile radius
around the blaze.
   The Environment Ministry declared Tyre King, Ontario's largest
tire dump, an illegal waste site in December 1985.
   The fire was initially described as a major environmental
disaster, and officials had feared the oily runoff created by the
melted tires might have contaminated drinking water in local wells.
   But experts said recently that damage from both the oil and
smoke was less than had been expected.

<HEAD>Coroner Reverses Self, Says Man Was Beaten to Death by Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Orleans Parish coroner on Thursday
changed his explanation of a police killer's death and agreed with
private pathologists who said the black man was beaten to death by
police.
   ``After careful and extensive investigation ... into the death
of Adolph Archie, it is my decision that the classification of the
death is homicide, police intervention,'' Dr. Frank Minyard wrote
in a brief statement.
   At a news conference March 23, the day Archie died, Minyard said
an autopsy indicated that he had suffocated on his own blood after
ripping a tracheal tube from his throat while waiting for a CAT
scan.
   But pathologists hired by Archie's family said their autopsies
found little blood in Archie's lungs and a great deal of evidence
that he had been beaten to death. He had a cracked skull, a crushed
larynx, a shattered face and had been hit too many times to count,
said attorney Mary Howell.
   An autopsy also was performed for the FBI, but U.S. Attorney
John Volz has said results cannot be released while the
investigation was going on.
   Police Superintendent Warren Woodfork could not be reached for
comment. ``Superintendent Woodfork is not in his office, and we
have no comment at this time,'' said police Sgt. Robert Young.
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference and another civil
rights group, the Grass Roots Organization for Women, have called
for Minyard's resignation. According to officials for the groups,
police have told them confidentially that four police officers beat
Archie.
   Police said Archie punched a guard who surprised him breaking
into a car at the Louisiana Superdome on March 22, stole his gun
and then ran into rush-hour traffic.
   Officer Earl Hauck II, directing traffic downtown, was shot
after he cornered Archie near an office building loading dock,
police said.
   Archie was pulled out from under a car minutes later, officers
said.
   An officer headed toward Charity Hospital with Archie, but
Woodfork said officials decided to take him first to a police
station because he might be in danger from Hauck's fellow officers,
who had gathered at the hospital.
   Archie was held for 45 minutes at the station where Hauck had
worked, then taken to the hospital, where he died about 13 hours
later.
   Minyard said April 4 that his staff's autopsy was as thorough as
possible in two hours, and added that he believed police reports
that Archie had fallen in a struggle after he lunged for an
officer's gun.
   ``Every day I work with homicide. And if I don't believe them
... the whole system breaks down,'' he said then. ``I have to
believe what they tell me.''

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Thursday
that his chief spokesman unintentionally confirmed to a reporter
that there was a criminal investigation involving Rep. William H.
Gray III.
   Thornburgh said press secretary David Runkel was ``following my
standing instruction'' not to mislead the media when he did not
steer CBS reporter Rita Braver off the story last spring.
   The attorney general, who launched a criminal investigation of
the unauthorized disclosure of the investigation, said Runkel's
failure to deny information Ms. Braver had obtained from other
sources was not misconduct.
   ``A refusal to deny or wave a reporter off a story with which he
is confronted by the reporter does not, in my view, constitute
misconduct,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``Unfortunately there are circumstances where a statement of the
kind likely made here by Mr. Runkel may be used by a reporter as
confirmation of a story,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``A real distinction must be made, I believe, between an
unsolicited and affirmative unauthorized disclosure and such a
`confirmation' by one responsible for dealing with the media,''
Thornburgh said.
   The CBS story, aired while Gray, D-Pa., was seeking election as
House majority whip, produced a storm of indignation from Democrats
in Congress who accused the Justice Department of a politically
inspired leak.
   The Justice Department took pains a few days later to correct
the impression left by the CBS story that Gray was under
investigation. In an unusual statement, Thornburgh's office said
the Pennsylvania Democrat was not a target of the investigation.
   The attorney general, who is in Mexico attending a drug
enforcement conference, issued the statement in response to a story
published Thursday in the New York Times, which also said that
Runkel failed a lie detector test during the leak investigation.
   Department spokesman Daniel Eramian, who read the statement to
reporters, refused to comment on the Times account of the lie
detector test.
   But Runkel, who was traveling with Thornburgh and unavailable
for comment, has previously refused to say whether he was one of
the 10 people who took polygraph tests during the leak
investigation.
   Runkel has acknowledged that he testified before a grand jury
about the case.
   Under routine investigative procedures, a subject who fails a
polygraph test is summoned for questioning before a grand jury.
   Thornburgh has been an outspoken opponent of unauthorized leaks
about pending criminal investigations, making it a hallmark of his
tenure as attorney general.
   The attorney general has repeatedly cited the Gray leak as an
egregious example.
   Eleven FBI agents who conducted the leak investigation took
sworn statements from 109 people.
   In a letter to Congress in December, Thornburgh reported that
investigation ``has not produced sufficient evidence to enable me
to ascertain that any present employee of the Department of Justice
was responsible for the disclosure.''
   ``I have determined that no termination of employment or other
disciplinary action is justified in this matter at this time,'' the
attorney general had said in his letter to Congress.

   Norway said Thursday that Lithuania is free
to buy its oil, but it urged Moscow to lift an energy embargo
against the Baltic republic before outside supplies are needed.
   A Lithuanian delegation led by Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene sought support from Norwegian leaders, but there were no
immediate contracts or offers of government aid, said Foreign
Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
   ``Norway has not used, and will not use, oil as a foreign policy
tool,'' Bondevik said, adding that it was up to the oil companies
to decide whether to sell to Lithuania.
   The Oslo trip, planned weeks ago, coincided with the decision by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to close the tap of crude oil
and restrict natural gas supplies to Lithuania for refusing to
scrap pro-independence laws.
   ``We were expecting this,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said when told by
reporters of the cutback on natural gas. ``We believe Lithuania
will survive without natural gas, but life will be reduced, cut off
from normal possibilities.''
   Norway pumps 1.5 million barrels a day from North Sea fields,
making it the second-largest exporter outside the OPEC oil cartel.
It also exports natural gas, but it has no way to deliver it to
Lithuania.
   Bondevik said he summoned Soviet Ambassador Alexandre Teterine
to express Norway's opposition to the use of economic pressure to
thwart Lithuania's independence drive.
   He said Norway favored flexibility by both Moscow and Lithuania
and urged negotiations without pressure or preconditions, before
the conflict threatened East-West relations.
   In the talks with Mrs. Prunskiene, ``we made it clear that the
Lithuanians are free to contact the suppliers of petroleum,'' he
said. ``We will not step in, much less hinder this.''
   The state oil company Statoil has said it was willing to sell
oil to Lithuania at market prices for hard currency, but Lithuania
has little hard currency. A second potential supplier is Norsk
Hydro company, which is 51 percent state-owned.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she hoped to meet with directors of both
companies Friday. She said she did not expect to secure future
supplies during the three-day visit, but to establish contacts that
might lead to later contracts. She said Lithuania also would need
credit.
   She acknowledged that the Soviet navy could easily blockade
Lithuania's harbors but said: ``It would be an unthinkable thing if
the Soviet Union stops oil delivery from other sources.''
   After meeting Bondevik, Teterine said Moscow ``would handle the
question if it arises'' of Norway supplying Lithuania. But he noted
recent legal reforms allowing the Baltic republics to deal with
their own economic affairs.
   ``Perhaps it is up to the leadership of each republic to decide
on how they will get petroleum supplies and sell their products,''
he said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said the energy squeeze would not force the
republic to withdraw its March 11 declaration of independence.
   ``There is no question of retreating from our position,'' she
said. The fate of Lithuania will ``to a high degree define the
future of Western Europe.''
   Her visit put Prime Minister Jan P. Syse's government in the
awkward position of being in front of its NATO allies in responding
to the Lithuanian crisis. Syse has been under pressure from
opponents on the left and right to come to Lithuania's aid, even at
the risk of rousing Moscow's ire.
   The Lithuanians came to Norway at the invitation of the three
parties in the ruling coalition to discuss political ideology, not
aid. Syse insisted he met the delegation in his role as
Conservative Party chairman rather than head of government.
   The Lithuanian delegation flew from the republic's capital to
Moscow on the Soviet carrier Aeroflot, then transferred to another
Aeroflot flight for a flight to Copenhagen, Denmark. In Copenhagen
they then boarded a Scandinavian Airlines System airplane and flew
on to Oslo.

<HEAD>First Anti-Collision System Being Installed On Commercial Fleet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new jetliner full of passengers flew
intentionally too close to a small plane on Thursday in a
demonstration of the first collision-avoidance system to be
approved for a commercial airliner fleet.
   In a change that the airline industry says will cost it nearly
$1 billion, airlines must install the Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System (TCAS II) in all their large jets before the end
of 1993.
   ``Climb! Climb! Climb!'' said an emphatic male voice generated
by the TCAS II built into the first of 100 USAir jetliners to be
equipped this year.
   A small screen in the cockpit showed a red dot, indicating that
another plane was dangerously close.
   With a series of maneuvers between the small plane and the
Boeing 737-400 carrying industry and government officials and
several reporters and photographers, pilots demonstrated the TCAS
II system.
   Congress has ordered that one-fifth of each carrier's airliners
must have the TCAS II units installed before the end of this year
at a cost of about $125,000 each.
   The bill for the whole U.S. fleet is expected to exceed $450
million. Airlines put the cost at closer to $1 billion, figuring in
labor and lost profits during installation which takes about five
days.
   Smaller passenger planes are required to have a less
sophisticated version, TCAS I, which emits traffic warnings when
other planes come too near, but does not tell the pilot what to do.
   Time after time, the small plane came on a collision course with
the USAir jet. Each time, the TCAS screen showed the location of
the intruding aircraft and a voice from a speaker in the cockpit
ceiling gave quick, precise instructions to the pilot, beginning
with, ``Traffic!'' and ending with, ``Clear of conflict'' as
passengers watched the small plane whiz by within a few hundred
feet of the airliner.
   If two TCAS computers meet in the sky, they communicate with
each other, and one pilot is told to ``climb'' and the other to
``descend,'' said Ace Card, Bendix-King program manager for TCAS.
   An even more sophisticated third generation of the system, TCAS
III, is being developed to give pilots horizontal instructions, as
well.
   Honeywell has been testing such a system on an FAA airliner, but
it is not expected to be approved for installation on commercial
planes for several years.
   The TCAS system gives the pilot a miniature air traffic control
system in the sky, showing aircraft within a 40-mile radius. It can
only detect planes with transponders that emit radar signals. All
but the smallest private planes have them.
   USAir officials said their 737 is the first commercial airplane
to be equipped and certificated by the FAA with the TCAS unit.
   Northwest, United and Piedmont each equipped a plane with test
versions of TCAS when the system was being evaluated by the FAA.
   Three companies manufacture TCAS systems that meet FAA
specifications. The ones being put on USAir's fleet are made by
Allied-Signal Aerospace's Bendix-King Air Transport Avionics
Division.
   Other manufacturers are the Air Transport Systems Division of
Honeywell Inc., and the Collins divisions of Rockwell International.
   The system was required as an added measure of safety for air
travelers.
   Tom McSweeney, an FAA official who was on the demonstration
flight, said the system would have the added benefit of making it
easier for pilots to maintain proper separation from other aircraft
during landings and giving them more information when they are in
areas not covered by air traffic controllers.
   The system, however, is seen only as a backup to FAA controllers
who monitor all flights and have responsibility for maintaining
safe distances between aircraft, particularly those the pilots
cannot see out of the cockpit window.

<HEAD>AIDS Vaccine May Protect Healthy Cells From Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine created by a pharmaceutical
company appears to protect human immune cells from infection by the
AIDS virus when the cells are in mice, but a Yale researcher
cautions it may not work with people.
   The vaccine, called VaxSyn HIV-1, was developed by MicroGeneSys
Inc. of West Haven.
   It has been able to defend human immune cells transplanted into
specially bred mice, while mice injected with cells from
unvaccinated people were vulnerable to the virus, officials at the
company said Wednesday.
   The company said tests on people could begin soon.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institutes of
Health AIDS program, called the vaccine ``potentially a very
important finding.'' The test is ``the first evidence of protective
immunity in humans,'' he said.
   Francis Black, professor of epidemiology and microbiology at the
Yale School of Medicine, called the experiment ``ingenious,''
saying it marks an important step toward a vaccine to prevent
infection by the deadly virus.
   But he cautioned that it does not prove that the MicroGeneSys
vaccine will work in people.
   ``In humans there would be other cells that doubtless play a
role'' in the progress of AIDS, Black said. ``There are a lot of
other differences between mice and men.''
   The experiment was designed to test the vaccine on cells living
in mice, to avoid the danger of infecting healthy people.
   The MicroGeneSys vaccine is composed of the outer protein coat
of the AIDS virus. It is made by altering the genes of caterpillar
cells to make the protein, which by itself is not dangerous or
infectious.
   Franklin Volvovitz, president of MicroGeneSys, said healthy test
subjects were first injected with the vaccine. A type of
infection-fighting white blood cell then was taken from the people
and transplanted into mice bred to lack a strong immune system.
   After the human immune cells, called peripheral blood
leukocytes, grew in the mice, the rodents were exposed to the AIDS
virus, Volvovitz explained.
   In one test, 11 of the 12 mice tested were protected against the
virus, Volvovitz said. However, all the mice given white blood
cells from volunteers not injected with the vaccine succumbed to
the AIDS virus.
   The study, which was reported at a symposium on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in Colorado earlier this month, was performed
at the Medical Biology Institute in La Jolla, Calif., a non-profit
laboratory funded by the federal government.
   Black said many scientists consider an AIDS vaccine impossible
because of the complex ways in which the virus and the human immune
system work.
   ``I remain very optimistic that a vaccine will be developed,''
he said. ``I think they (MicroGeneSys) are fairly close to a
clinical trial.''
   The vaccine probably would be given to members of a population
at high risk for AIDS, and then rates of the disease would be
analyzed, Black said.
   The study would be complicated and expensive, because it would
require participation of large numbers of people, he said.
   The vaccine is being tested both as a measure to prevent
infection by the AIDS virus and as a treatment for those already
infected.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration told Congress on
Thursday that the U.S. trade deficit, after narrowing for the last
two years, could worsen in 1990 and an administration official said
Japan must do more to lower its huge trade surplus.
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said Japan's closed
markets pose ``important risks for the world economy'' and added
that nations such as Japan need to protect the trading system from
protectionist onslaughts.
   ``Clearly, Japan has not done its part,'' Mulford told a Senate
Banking subcommittee reviewing a new administration report on the
outlook for world trade in 1990.
   The report said any improvement in the trade deficit would be
``at very best modest'' and there was a distinct possibility the
deficit could actually widen this year.
   The report, which the Treasury Department must prepare under the
1988 trade law, noted that the dollar has risen in value against
the Japanese yen by almost 20 percent over the last year.
   A stronger dollar threatens to widen the trade deficit by making
U.S. goods less competitive on overseas markets and allowing
foreign producers to lower prices to American consumers.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said that executives of the Caterpillar
company had told him that ``all their efforts to improve their
international competitiveness had been wiped out'' by the recent
currency changes.
   ``If the yen keeps falling against the dollar, I don't see how
our trade performance can be improved,'' Dixon said.
   Mulford said that the weakness of the yen was of a concern to
the United States and its allies in the Group of Seven _ Japan,
West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada _ and would be a
primary topic on the agenda when the group next meets in early May
in Washington.
   However, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether the G-7
countries would be able to come up with any stronger coordinated
effort to stabilize currency rates than the bland statement issued
when the group met earlier this month in Paris.
   Mulford said that while exchange rates should be monitored, he
believed it was more important mow for the United States to push
ahead with its efforts to dismantle Japan's structural barriers to
foreign products, including American goods.
   ``Simply depreciating the dollar against the yen is not going to
do'' what is necessary to solve the U.S.-Japan trade deficit, he
said.
   The Bush administration has been seeking to remove a variety of
Japanese trade barriers. The broadest effort involves the
Structural Impediments Initiative aimed at eliminating broad-based
barriers to trade.

   Pro-Iranian kidnappers today indefinitely
postponed the release of an American hostage because the United
States failed to meet their demand to send a senior State
Department official to Syria.
   President Bush said this afternoon in response to the news that
the United States has ``been disappointed before'' by dashed hopes
for the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon and repeated he will
not meet the demands of kidnappers.
   The announcement of the postponement came in an Arabic-language
statement delivered by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine to the independent Beirut newspaper an-Nahar and a
Western news agency.
   The handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture
of Robert Polhill, one of three U.S. educators held by the group
since Jan. 24, 1987.
   The kidnappers had said Wednesday that they would freeing one of
the three American educators within 48 hours, or by Friday evening.
The other two are Jesse Turner and Alann Steen.
   The group had said that it was acting in response to requests
from Iran and Syria, whose leaders have encouraged an end to the
hostage crisis. The group implied that some sort of exchange was
involved.
   Bush, in Key Largo, Fla., told a news conference, ``I would add
that we are not talking to the hostage-holders.''
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had demanded
that John Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, fly to Damascus ``to coordinate some final steps'' leading
to the release.
   It did not specify what they expected of Kelly, the U.S.
ambassador to Lebanon from 1983 to 1988. He was in Bonn, West
Germany, on Wednesday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III had cautiously welcomed
the reports but said Kelly had no plans to fly to the Middle East
``at the present time.''
   ``As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had
been under way on a basis that they would be concluded and
finalized. But Kelly's failure to respond has so far frustrated the
release, which made us postpone this operation until the picture is
clearerd,'' today's statement said.
   Although the Bush administration refused to send Kelly, it
dispatched a hostage reception team to West Germany after hearing
``statements of imminent release'' of an American hostage, the
White House said.
   The latest statement reiterated a threat the group made last
month to attack jetliners, airlines and airports used to transport
Soviet Jewish emigrants to Israel.
   ``The organization serves this final warning ... on all those
participating in this matter, especially those countries offering
transit facilities,'' the statement said.
   ``This is the last warning. All civilians should stay away from
the airports, airlines and jetliners that will be the targets for
operations mounted at times we deem adequate.''
   Earlier today, Shiite militiamen clashed in west Beirut and the
city's southern slums, prompting fears that that would delay the
hostage release.
   Many of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon, including eight
Americans, are believed held in south Beirut.
   Police in Beirut said foot patrols of Syria's 12,500-strong
force in the city's Moslem sector moved in to contain the fighting
between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and Syrian-backed Amal.
   ``You can't expect a hostage to be freed in such risky
conditions,'' a police spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Also, Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian guerrilla bases 10
miles south of Beirut, targeting tunnel bases manned by guerrillas
of Capt. Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   The kidnappers' statement on Wednesday was accompanied by an
instant photograph of Turner _ the first photo of him alone since
three months after his abduction.
   Steen and Polhill were taken with Turner from the campus of
Beirut University College. Polhill, 55, lectured in accounting.
   Turner, 42, was a visiting mathematics and computer science
professor. Steen, who will be 51 Sunday, taught journalism.

<HEAD>Canned Turkey Products Recalled In Puerto Rico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday a
food company in Puerto Rico is voluntarily recalling three canned
turkey products because food spoilage organisms had been found in
one of the products.
   All of the suspected food was said to have been distributed to
schools and other institutions in Puerto Rico. There was no
estimate of the quantity of products distributed.
   The department said Federal Packing Co. Inc. of Carolina, P.R.,
``also reports the isolation of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum
in samples of its products tested by a private laboratory.''
   According to USDA references, these organisms can cause
botulism, a deadly form of food poisoning.
   The food spoilage organisms were detected when the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service tested some of the company's
canned boned turkey in bouillon, officials said. No botulinum was
detected by USDA, but the agency said it is continuing the tests.
   Both of the products were produced for the Puerto Rico
Department of Education and were distributed to public and private
schools, churches, charitable organizations and the Head Start
program in Puerto Rico.
   The products ``are not officially distributed in U.S. locations
outside of Puerto Rico,'' the announcement said.
   Officials said the products are packed in 50-ounce cans and are
labeled ``Canned Boned Turkey in Bouillon,'' ``Canned Boned Turkey
in Broth,'' or ``Canned Boned Turkey with Natural Juices Diced
Fully Cooked.''
   The establishment number P-6694 is located inside the inspection
seal on the label, and the wording ``Packed for AJM Meat Packing
Inc.'' appears on the bottom of the label.
   Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said there have been ``reports
of seven unconfirmed illnesses that may have been associated with
consumption of the canned boned turkey in bouillon.''
   Prucha said institutions that may have received the products
should check their inventory, and if any are found should contact
the distribution warehouse that supplied them. The products should
not be eaten or tasted.

   The United States plans to withdraw more than
12,000 of its troops in Asia over the next three years and
additional cuts are possible as the Soviet threat diminishes,
administration officials said Thursday.
   Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense for policy, detailed
the planned changes in U.S. forces as he presented a report
required by Congress on military strategy in the Pacific.
   The report reiterated many of the proposals Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney unveiled in February during his two-week visit to the
Pacific rim.
   Under the administration plan, 10 percent of the 120,000
American forces based in Asia would be withdrawn _ some 7,000
military personnel of the 44,000 U.S. forces in Korea and 5,000 to
6,000 of the 50,000 in Japan.
   ``Since our forward deployments have been most commonly
justified as a deterrent to Soviet expansionism, our presence in
the region is now seen as less relevant in light of domestic
changes with the Soviet Union and prospects for U.S.-Soviet arms
control negotiations,'' the report said.
   It said further reductions could be considered in later years.
   However, the report stresses threats to U.S. economic and
political interests in the Pacific remain despite the dramatic
changes overseas.
   The communist government of North Korea is still pursuing
reunification with South Korea and in other Southeast Asian nations
U.S. interests are vulnerable to terrorism.
   ``Our deterrence posture and forward presence in East Asia have
been successful, and it remains in our interest to maintain a
forward deployed strategy, including a military presence on the
Korean peninsula and elsewhere in East Asia and the Western
Pacific,'' the report said.
   The United States will also push for Asian nations to share a
larger portion of the financial burden for defense.
   In his meeting with Japanese officials in February, Cheney
sought increases in the $2.4 billion annual support toward the $7
billion cost of the American deployment in Japan.
   ``It is appropriate to expect our prosperous Asian allies _
Japan and Korea _ to assume greater responsibility for their own
defense and, by so doing, to contribute more directly to the
stability of the region,'' the report said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services panel,
stressed the need for the U.S. allies to foot more of the defense
bill and noted the strong congressional support for such action.
   ``I believe that almost everybody I know on Capitol Hill _ both
political parties _ believes South Korea ought to contribute more
to offset,'' Nunn said.
   Wolfowitz said South Korea has tripled its defense budget in
recent years, allowing the United States to consider reductions.

<HEAD>Milk Prices Dropping On The Farm, But Not Yet At Retail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The farm price of milk has dropped sharply
from the record highs of last winter, but consumers may have to
wait a while longer to see much effect, an Agriculture Department
report said Thursday.
   Analysts said there are ``conflicting indications of the
supply-demand balance'' in the dairy markets.
   ``Milk production has resumed expansion, and falling
international prices of non-fat dry milk have demolished
opportunities for commercial exports,'' the report said.
   But domestic demand has been strong, both commercially and to
rebuild depleted inventories.
   Milk prices at the farm probably will slip in the coming months,
and ``the onset of seasonal increases may be delayed,'' the report
said. Overall, the farm price of milk in 1990 may average 4 percent
to 9 percent below last year's all-milk price of $13.51 per
hundredweight.
   Consumer prices of dairy products as a group in early 1990 had
risen more than 10 percent from a year earlier, greatly exceeding
the overall increases in retail food and consumer prices.
   ``Retail dairy prices probably will trend down in coming months,
although any signs of strength in wholesale prices will tend to
lessen and delay retail price declines,'' the report said.

   Czechoslovakia restored diplomatic relations
with the Vatican on Thursday, sweeping away a remnant of 40 years
of church-state hostility before a historic papal visit this
weekend.
   Czechoslovakia joined a growing list of Eastern European
countries forging ties with the Holy See in an expansion of the
church's influence in the once Communist-dominated region.
   The Prague government interrupted diplomatic relations in March
1950 when it gave the papal envoy three days to leave the country,
said the Vatican in a statement.
   The Vatican hailed the resumption of ties as bringing an end to
the ``sad parenthesis of these last 40 years.''
   Pope John Paul II's visit Saturday and Sunday to Czechoslovakia
will be his first to a Warsaw Pact country other than his native
Poland.
   ``The trip symbolizes ... everything that has happened in the
countries of what is by now the ex-Communist world,'' said the
Vatican newspaper L`Osservatore Romano.
   Under a succession of hard-line Communist regimes that ruled
until Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution last November, such a
visit was unthinkable.
   As elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, organized religion in
Czechoslovakia was rigidly controlled, believers were repressed and
religious education was severely restricted.
   In his inauguration speech Dec. 29, President Vaclav Havel, who
had been jailed by the Communist regime, asked the pope to visit
Prague as a goodwill gesture to support the democratic changes
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Poland last year re-established diplomatic relations with the
Vatican, followed by Hungary in February. A month ago, the Vatican
and the Soviet Union established official ties for the first time
since the Russian Revolution although they fall short of full
diplomatic relations.
   The Vatican has also restored the leadership of the church in
Romania and diplomatic ties with Bucharest are believed not far off.
   The announcement at the Vatican and in Prague said relations
were being renewed on the level of a Czechoslovak Embassy and an
apostolic nunciature.
   The envoys were not immediately named.
   The Vatican estimates that a little more than half of
Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million people are Roman Catholics.
   On several occasions, John Paul had deplored the ``sad state''
of the church in Czechoslovakia, where up to 10 of the country's 13
dioceses were left without bishops. The church is led by
90-year-old Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who long struggled for
church freedoms.
   Soon after the regime led by Milos Jakes was toppled, relations
with Rome warmed. In recent months the Vatican has returned the
church hierarchy to full strength.
   Millions of Catholics are expected to attend the papal events in
Prague, the shrine city of Velehrad and Bratislava during the
two-day visit, the first by a pope to Czechoslovakia.
   The trip will be the 46th foreign tour of John Paul's papacy.
Trips by John Paul to Poland and Hungary are scheduled next year.

   Two major Japanese electronics firms said Thursday
they will increase their purchases of foreign products to reduce
trade friction with the United States.
   The government also adopted a new set of procedures for
procurement of supercomputers by state-run agencies and
universities, and said it would open talks with Washington on
amorphous metals, another contentious trade issue.
   Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said they will
boost their purchases of foreign-made semiconductors from 14
percent and 13 percent respectively to 20 percent by next year.
   Matsushita sells under the National, Panasonic and Quasar brand
names.
   ``We are making an earnest effort by setting the 20 percent
target,'' Sony spokesman Koichi Izukura said.
   Sony will allow foreign chip makers to develop more
semiconductors for future products starting at the product design
stage, Izukura said.
   U.S. semiconductor makers have complained that they frequently
are not given information by Japanese companies about future
products that would allow them to design new computer chips for
those products.
   Sony uses 2,000-2,500 types of new chips each year in its audio
and video products, Izukura said. About 400 were designed by
foreign companies in fiscal 1989, he said.
   In the current fiscal year, which began April 1, Sony plans to
procure 500-600 types of chips from foreign chip makers that will
be developed for new products, Izukura said.
   In 1986 the United States and Japan set a goal for the foreign
share of the Japanese chip market to be 20 percent by July 1991.
Foreign chips accounted for 12.9 percent of the market during the
last three months of 1989.
   Meanwhile, Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,
said it will increase its chip imports to a level higher than its
import target for fiscal 1992 of $740 million.
   Nissan said as a result of meetings with 26 U.S. parts suppliers
this month, it would place orders for 53 items made by the
suppliers. It did not identify the companies.
   In supercomputer trade, U.S. officials say Japan discriminates
against foreign suppliers because purchasing procedures are unclear
and Japanese makers are allowed to sell at sharply lower ``academic
discounts.''
   The new procedures include a ban on unfair academic discounts
and shorten the period for procurement to 130 days from 180 days,
an official in the Prime Minister's office said.
   The new process will be implemented May 1, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry announced that Tokyo and Washington
would begin talks aimed at finding a solution within 150 days to
U.S. trade complaints involving amorphous metals. The metals are a
high-technology product used mainly to improve the efficiency of
electric power transformers.

   A former drug addict and alcoholic who blames
her substance abuse for her daughter's retardation asked a House
committee Thursday to help addicted pregnant women.
   The woman, identified only as Kathleen X, said she was 14 when
she began using heroin and alcohol.
   Over the next 16 years, she had five children. Two are normal,
two died in infancy and one is mentally retarded, diagnosed this
year as suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome.
   ``We now recognize that fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the
greatest causes of birth defects and mental retardation in the
United States,'' Iris Smith, project director of the Georgia
Addiction, Pregnancy and Parenting Program in Atlanta, told the
House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   Infants born to alcoholic women are often premature and later
display learning or behavioral disorders, growth retardation and
deficits in memory or attention, Smith said.
   Kathleen X told the panel that she would promise her children
she would stop using drugs, ``but I could never keep that promise.''
   She said she stopped using drugs and alcohol six years ago when
she entered a long-term treatment program. She's now regional
director of community outreach and education for a drug treatment
center in suburban Maryland.
   Committee Chairman George Miller, D-Calif., noted that Kathleen
X is white and grew up in an affluent area. He said her story
illustrated that the problem affects all socio-economic groups.
   Dr. Sheila B. Blume of South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, N.Y.,
said efforts must be made to identify addicted women before they
give birth.
   ``Pregnancy is the best time to treat an alcoholic woman or a
chemically dependent woman,'' she said. ``The incentive to have the
healthiest possible infant is the best motivator.''
   Kathleen X said she stopped using drugs when she was pregnant
but continued to drink wine.
   ``Back then no one said there was anything wrong with that,''
she said.

   Singer Willie Nelson isn't much of a
golfer, but he's now got a winning stroke named after him: the
``Pedernales hole-in-one.''
   Nelson owns the Pedernales Country Club west of Austin, a course
known for its imaginative rules and a par rating that its owner
says ``is anything I want it to be'' on any given day.
   Nelson has a 21 handicap, which means he would have to be
credited 21 strokes to be evenly matched with a golfer capable of
hitting par.
   On Wednesday, playing in the pro-am portion of the Legends of
Golf tournament at the par-72 Barton Creek Country Club, Nelson was
awarded two handicap strokes on the par-4 16th hole.
   Nelson chipped in his third shot, so it was scored as a net 1 _
and immediately dubbed a ``Pedernales'' hole-in-one.
   The ace helped the team finish in a tie for third in the pro-am
with a score of 54. The team's professional was Chi Chi Rodriguez,
who shot a 66, and the team's amateurs included Nelson, former
University of Texas football coach Darrell Royal and country singer
George Strait.

   What do you do if you see two guys
climbing toward your home wearing hardhats, welder's jackets and
chainsaw-proof leggings, and carrying badminton rackets?
   If you're a great horned owl, you back off. That's what a pair
of tree service men arrayed in that manner discovered as they
climbed warily to an owls' nest to offer them up an orphan owl
found on the ground.
   ``An owl has to be brought up where it can see other owls.
Otherwise, it thinks it's a human and can never be released,'' said
Sherri Smith, a volunteer, who found the new nest atop a 60-foot
white oak in Scio Township.
   The adoptive father wasn't around and the mother flew away as
Brad Burton, owner of an Ann Arbor tree service, and employee Bill
Guy scaled the tree Tuesday afternoon to place the baby owl in its
new home.
   A Canadian wildlife authority had warned that adult owls might
attack humans venturing near the nest, so Burton and Guy brought
along all the protective garb they could find, not to mention the
badminton rackets.
   Twice the owls' own baby jumped from the nest and coasted to the
ground, where it was put in a sack and hoisted back home. The
second time, it stayed.
   And on Wednesday, Smith said, a telescope caught up with the
mother and two babies: ``All three were preening their feathers and
happy in the sun, so everything is fine.''

<HEAD>Health Officials Hope Inquiry Resolves Coroner's Office
Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City health officials hope an inquiry into the
Denver coroner's office will end controversy that developed after
lawyers questioned autopsy findings in the deaths of three children.
   ``We are going to try to do what we can as soon as possible so
we can put to sleep the rumors and unanswered questions,'' said Vi
Swenson, chairwoman of the board of the Denver Department of Health
and Hospitals.
   ``I can't say we've drawn a conclusion. Certainly there are some
questions that have to be answered, but I can't say there is
something wrong in the coroner's office,'' Swenson said Wednesday.
``Certainly, there may be some things that people are not
comfortable with.''
   Mayor Federico Pena on Wednesday ordered the board of the
Department of Health and Hospitals to investigate the office after
attorneys and medical experts raised questions about the competence
of Dr. Robert Deters of Loveland, who has been under contract to
perform autopsies for Denver.
   In the past year, the coroner's office operated without a
full-time pathologist, turning its work over to Deters, who
performed 390 autopsies for Denver in 10 months.
   In addition, Deters has carried a full load of responsibilities
as head of the pathology department at McKee Medical Center in
Loveland. In that capacity, he has done 110 autopsies in the past
16 months.
   The National Association of Medical Examiners recommends that a
coroner carry an annual caseload of 250.
   In the past month, prosecutors and defense attorneys, concerned
about Deters' competence, have sought second opinions in three
child-death cases:
   _A 16-month-old boy died Jan. 17 at a hospital, three days after
he was admitted exhibiting what doctors said were symptoms of
having been hit on the ear. The boyfriend of the child's mother was
arrested for investigation of child-abuse charges, but released
after Deters ruled the boy died of complications from an ear
infection. The district attorney's office requested a second
opinion.
   _A 2-year-old child died in August after falling in his home.
Deters ruled there was no evidence of foul play and police closed
an investigation of child-abuse allegations. The district attorney
requested a second opinion.
   _A 2-month-old boy died Feb. 6, and his mother is accused of
starving him to death. A public defender sought a second opinion
after criticizing the coroner's office for withholding autopsy
reports and failing to perform required tests.
   In addition, a defense attorney has challenged Deters' findings
in the case of a 13-month-old Fort Collins girl who was fatally
beaten in August 1988. The attorney claims Deters authorized the
removal of the victim's organs before vital tests were done.
   At a news conference Wednesday, officials at the Denver
coroner's office defended Deters, saying he provided competent,
high-quality work during a crisis at the office.
   Deters, too, stood by his work.
   ``I worked hard. I put in some long hours ... I dedicated
however much time was required to do the job thoroughly,'' he said.
``People have alleged shortcuts were taken. No shortcuts were
taken. The job was done right.''

   President Bush said Thursday he declined
to send a senior State Department official to Syria as demanded by
the holders of an American hostage because ``the United States does
not knuckle under to demands.''
   ``We have a perfectly capable, accredited diplomat on the scene
in Syria,'' the president said.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine cited U.S.
refusal to send John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Middle
Eastern affairs, as the reason for not releasing one of three
hostages held by the group in Lebanon.
   The group had said it wanted Kelly ``to coordinate some final
steps'' for the release.
   Speaking to reporters after his meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand, Bush said he had not heard of the Kelly
connection to the kidnappers' refusal.
   ``We are not talking to the hostage holders,'' the president
said.
   ``We do not meet demands. Our ambassador to Syria is back in
Syria. We have been disappointed before, hopes raised only to have
them dashed by excessive speculation,'' he said.
   Bush said he was grateful to Syria for trying to play a
constructive role in the matter.
   A reporter said France had been more successful in gaining
freedom for its hostages and asked Bush whether the two presidents
had discussed that. Bush turned the question over to Mitterrand
after saying the matter had been discussed by staff members.
   ``The freeing of the hostages in the early period in 1988 took
place in somewhat different circumstances ... and under different
conditions,'' the French president said. ``Each individual case of
hostages is in fact a different and separate case.''
   The kidnappers said on Wednesday they would free one of the
three American educators they are holding within 24 hours, or by
Friday evening. The three are Robert Polhill, Jesse Turner and
Alann Steen, but the kidnappers did not say who was to be released.
   The group said at the time that it was acting in response to
requests from Iran and Syria, whose leaders have encouraged an end
to the hostage crisis.
   It did not specify what they expected of Kelly, the U.S.
ambassador to Lebanon from 1983 to 1988. He was in Bonn, West
Germany, on Wednesday.
   ``As for the release of the American hostage, arrangements had
been under way on a basis that they would be concluded and
finalized. But Kelly's failure to respond has so far frustrated the
release, which made us postpone this operation until the picture is
clearer,'' said a statement Thursday from the group.

   Ladybugs, honey bees and crickets are
dropping like flies in Medfly-infested regions of Southern
California soaked in pesticide, leaving gardeners to battle aphids
thriving with their natural enemies gone.
   ``It's gross. It's sickening,'' said San Gabriel Valley
homeowner Peggy Watson, whose orange trees are covered with aphids.
   Frustrated gardeners are making a bee line for pesticide shelves
at nurseries and garden centers, where there has been a run on $4
tubes containing 1,000 ladybugs.
   ``We have people calling us up asking to reserve ladybugs,''
said Henrick Mar, manager of the San Gabriel Nursery.
   Pesticides sprayed by helicopters were intended to rid the
region of the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   The Medfly, thought to enter the country in illegally imported
fruit, threatens part of the state's $16 billion a year farm
economy because it feeds on and lays eggs in more than 200
varieties of cash crops.
   Gov. George Deukmejian said Thursday there was no alternative to
spraying. He said it would continue despite vocal protests and
attempts by municipalities to stop what they view as a potential
health menace.
   ``The Department of Agriculture is pursuing what is a
time-tested method of eradicating the Medfly,'' Deukmejian told
reporters. ``We cannot give up on this. We have to eradicate it.''
   Deukmejian said if eradication efforts fail there will be higher
food prices, quarantines on California fruit by foreign
governments, loss of jobs and even placement of maggot-infested
fruit on supermarket shelves.
   The blossom-devouring aphid has flourished because the pesticide
malathion has killed off its predators _ ladybugs, lacewings and
tiny wasps. They have been all but eliminated within the nearly 400
square miles of quarantine and spray zones.
   Wild honeybees, which pollinate fruit trees, also have fallen
victim to malathion spraying. ``It's as if they drop dead in
mid-flight,'' said Watson.
   Medfly spraying also has robbed spring of one of its traditional
sounds: the chirping of crickets.
   Aphids, leaf-scales and whiteflies survive the sprayings because
they live close to petals or beneath leaves, shielding them from
the pesticide droplets.
   ``Malathion spraying causes an imbalance,'' said Lester Ehler,
an entomologist at the University of California, Davis. He said
seven or eight sprays over an urban area is enough to kill off
beneficial insects.
   The aphid, enjoying a backyard garden feast without reprisal,
leaves disfigured rosebuds, wilted orchids and mold-coated leaves.
   ``There are aphids on my violets, aphids covering my herbs. It's
horrifying,'' said Marty Asolas, 42, of Bellflower. ``I have just
decided not to plant anything else because I can't bear to see my
flowers attacked.''
   The aphid infestation was expected by state officials.
   ``We knew this was going to happen. But it is infinitely
preferable to what the Medfly can do to the state,'' said Robert
Dowell, senior economic entomologist for the state Department of
Food and Agriculture.
   Aphids have become a hot topic among members of the Pacific Rose
Society, said the organization's president Bartje Miller. But
members also blame prime aphid breeding weather _ a dry winter
followed by warm spring showers.
   ``It's a whole combination of factors. I think Mother Nature is
just throwing us a curve,'' said Miller, who is also chairwoman of
Wrigley Gardens in Pasadena.
   The aphids are ``the worse I've seen in the eight years I've
been here,'' said Clair G. Martin III, curator of roses at the
Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San
Marino.
   It could take up to a year or longer after malathion spraying
ends for gardens to become home again to beneficial insects. ``We
don't know what the long term effects are on plant life,'' Ehler
said.
   Entomologists advise gardeners to control aphids and other pests
by hand-washing leaves with soap and water. Using more pesticide
will only prolong the time it takes beneficial bugs to return and
could burn leaves.
   Malathion spraying in Southern California began in force last
summer and was recently ordered over a wide area of Riverside
County that includes a commercial citrus grove.

   French President Francois Mitterrand on
Thursday proposed to President George Bush that the 16 NATO allies
hold a summit before year's end to discuss the changing face of
Europe.
   Mitterrand, emerging from several hours of talks with Bush at a
seaside resort, said Bush agreed with the idea.
   The summit would discuss the ``requirements of the new times
head,'' Mitterrand said.
   But although both men stressed the importance of maintaining
cohesion within NATO and maintaining U.S. troops in Europe,
Mitterrand appeared to place more emphasis on European
self-reliance.
   NATO must coordinate more closely ``with the other bodies within
which the allies find themselves together in Europe,'' including
the 12-nation European Economic Community and the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the French
president said.
   ``And I would add a very important additional note on this, to
prepare the Europeans for the idea of playing an increased role in
working for their own defense,'' said Mitterand.
   ``And with that in mind, I suggested to President Bush, and he
agreed, that we propose to our allies to hold a summit of the
alliance before the end of the year,'' he said.
   Mitterand said Europeans should also speed up their economic and
political union.
   He cited a joint letter issued earlier Thursday in Europe by
France and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, saying the first
concrete steps toward economic and political union in the EEC
should be in place by Jan. 1, 1993.
   Mitterrand also said he had emphasized the importance of the
CSCE, which takes in NATO and Warsaw Pact nations. ``We must always
remember that the CSCE is, and has been in the past, the only place
where all European countries can meet,'' he said.
   Asked whether he believed greater European self-reliance could
split the United States from its European allies, Bush said, ``I
don't see any danger'' of such division. He added his views of
Europe's future security were ``very close'' to those of the French.
   Bush said he had stressed to Mitterrand the ``key role'' of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the fall of communist
governments in Eastern Europe. ``The alliance must remain vigorous
in this critical period of transition,'' he said.
   ``I told the president that the U.S. will retain militarily
significant nuclear and conventional forces in Western Europe as
long as our allies desire our presence as part of a common security
effort,'' said Bush. ``And he indicated strong French support for
the continued U.S. presence.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's factories released 4.6 billion
pounds of toxic chemicals, including scores of carcinogens, in
1988, the Environmental Protection Agency reported Thursday. More
than half of the pollutants went into the air,
   The pollution, emitted from 19,762 industrial plants nationwide,
was 9 percent less than a year earlier, but the EPA said the
decline may be a result of better record keeping.
   EPA officials cautioned that they are unable from the raw
figures, the latest available, to assess the health risks to
individuals. The data do not take into account levels of toxicity,
release concentrations and actual exposure.
   Nevertheless, federal officials have been surprised at the high
volume of releases of toxic chemicals in both 1987, when 5 billion
pounds of pollution was reported, and 1988. The reporting
requirement covers 332 toxic chemicals.
   ``The figures are absolutely shocking,'' declared Rep. Gerry
Sikorksi, D-Minn., who along with several other members of Congress
obtained a special computer run on the EPA figures and provided
additional details about the releases.
   Among the chemicals routinely emitted from industrial sources
were 77 carcinogens. The most widely released cancer-causing
chemical _ 115 million pounds _ was dichloromethane, a chemical
often used as an industrial solvent and paint stripper.
   Industry released a total of 281 million pounds of carcinogens,
including chemicals such as arsenic, benzene and vinyl chloride.
   ``We've got to bring these pollution numbers down,'' EPA
Administrator William Reilly said as he released the latest data.
   Clean-air legislation that already has passed the Senate and is
being considered in the House would impose stringent controls on
toxic industrial chemicals and require companies to use the best
available technology to curb releases.
   Under current law, the EPA is required to deal with each
chemical separately. In more than a decade, it has placed controls
on only eight of the hundreds of toxic chemicals in use. Many of
the chemicals, however, are subject to local and state regulation.
   The releases reported by industry, however, are legal and within
federal standards, officials said.
   Chemical and allied industries accounted for about half of the
total releases. Two states with a concentration of petrochemical
plants _ Louisiana and Texas _ accounted for more than one-fourth
of the pollution totals.
   The toxic pollution figures reflect data provided the EPA by
19,762 industrial plants nationwide. It is the second year such
reports have been provided under a new citizen right-to-know law.
   The EPA announcement provided only general release statistics
and no information on specific plants.
   But information released by Sikorski from data contained on EPA
computer tapes showed that Amax Magnesium Co. of Rowley, Utah, had
by far the highest volume of releases into the air _ nearly 110
million pounds.
   Amax was followed among the top five industrial air polluters in
1988 by Tennessee Eastman Co., Kingsport, Tenn., 40 million pounds;
Avtex Fibers in Front Royal, Va., 34 million pounds; Triad
Chemical, Donaldsonville, La., 27 million pounds, and Eastman Kodak
Co., Rochester, N.Y., 21.6 million pounds.
   The Avtex Fibers plant in Virginia closed last November after a
lengthy battle with the state over pollution issues.
   The states with the largest volume of toxic chemical releases
overall were Louisiana, 716 million pounds; Texas, 596 million
pounds; Ohio, 229 million pounds; Florida, 226 million pounds;
Indiana, 213 million pounds, and Tennessee, 203 million pounds,
according to the EPA.
   More than half of the toxic releases, 2.43 billion pounds, went
into the air, while the remainder was disposed of in surface water,
stored in landfills or injected into underground wells. More than
half of the air pollutants were reported by the petrochemical,
rubber, plastics and primary metals industries.
   Industrial plants released 360 million pounds of toxic chemicals
into lakes, streams and rivers and disposed of 560 million pounds
in on-site landfills. About 1.22 billion pounds of chemicals were
injected deep into underground wells for storage.
   Another 570 million pounds of toxic chemicals were transferred
to municipal wastewater treatment plants for processing and an
additional 1.1 billion pounds of chemicals were turned over for
treatment and disposal at special off-site facilities or storage
sites, the EPA said.
   Neither the chemicals sent to the municipal plants nor those
sent elsewhere for treatment and disposal were counted by the EPA
in its overall release figure. Agency spokesman Sean McElheny said
it is assumed most of those chemicals are treated and not released
into the environment.
   However, the EPA has in the past criticized many municipal
treatment facilities for not adequately ensuring that industrial
wastes are kept from being released into surface waters. Neither
the private or municipal treatment facilities subject to the toxic
release reporting requirements.

   French President Francois Mitterrand on
Thursday defended his country's diplomatic ties to Libya and Iran,
saying both countries have denied responsibility for hostage-taking.
   Mitterrand said France maintains relations with many regimes
``we do not like.''
   At a news conference with President Bush, the French president
said ``it's very difficult to draw the line'' in deciding when a
country deserves to be ostracized.
   Both Iran and Libya ``have always said that they were not at the
origin of the hostage-taking,'' said Mitterrand.
   The United States has drawn the line against relations with the
two regimes, accusing both of sponsoring international terrorism
including, in Iran's case, influence over the terrorists holding
American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``As you know, we have a different situation in terms of
relations with Iran and Libya,'' said Bush.
   But on a day when the Islamic Jihad said in Beirut it was
reneging on its offer to release an American hostage, Bush said,
``let me just take this opportunity to repeat what I said when I
first became president: goodwill begets goodwill. And I link that
to the release of American hostages.
   ``We can't have normal relations when hostages are held,'' he
said, adding that in Libya's case ``a verifiable renunciation of
terror is terribly important ... if we are to have better relations
there.''
   The lawyerly Mitterrand said, ``It's always a very difficult
question.''
   He cited France's decision to maintain ties with Chile during
``the bloody dictatorship'' of Augusto Pinochet, which recently
ended. He said the French embassy became ``a useful point of
transit'' for those working in the Chilean resistance.
   ``I think it's probably a good idea to try to use those
relations (with Iran and Libya) ... to try to help to get the
release of the hostages,'' said Mitterrand. The French president
drew criticism at home last week when he praised Libya for its role
in securing the release of a French woman, her Belgian companion
and their child who had been held hostage in Lebanon.
   Mitterrand said, ``most Western countries do business with these
countries and often on a large scale.''
   ``At any rate, what is clear is that any country that would be
directly involved in hostage-taking or that would be a clear
accomplice in hostage-taking should be set outside the pale of the
civilized world community,'' Mitterrand said.
   On the Middle East, Mitterrand said it was ``unacceptable'' to
place conditions on where Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union can
settle. But he also cautioned Israel against further settlements on
the West Bank, saying, ``it is not wise to multiply such
settlements because they give rise to a climate of uncertainty''
that could undermine peace efforts.

   President Bush said Thursday ``there are
limits'' to U.S. patience for Soviet coercion of Lithuania but
refused to say when or how he might respond.
   As Moscow imposed new pressure on the breakway Baltic republic
by curbing oil and natural gas supplies, Bush said, ``I am greatly
concerned by this escalation in terms of using energy to push the
Lithuanians into line.''
   Bush, asked the extent of his patience, said, ``Yes, there are
limits and, having said that, I am convinced that Mr. Gorbachev
knows there are limits.''
   Bush made his comments at a news conference following a day of
talks with French President Francois Mitterrand at a plush
oceanside resort.
   With palm trees and sparkling waters as the backdrop for an
outdoor news conference, the two leaders met for reporters for 78
minutes.
   The session was prolonged by translation of all the remarks into
French. Bush appeared impatient at times, looking around, rubbing
his chin and grimacing during lengthy statements by Mitterrand.
   On various subjects:
   _Bush, when asked about a report that Mideast extremists had
postponed a plan to release an America hostage in Lebanon, said,
``We've been disappointed before, hopes raised only to have them
dashed by excessive speculation.''
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said the
release of a hostage was postponed because of U.S. refusal to send
John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern
affairs, to Syria to take part.
   ``The United States does not knuckle under to demands,'' said
Bush when asked why he did not dispatch Kelly as demanded by the
group.
   The president said he was grateful to Syria ``for trying to play
a constructive role'' regarding the hostages.
   _Mitterrand, defending his country's ties with Libya and Iran,
said he could not judge whether they were responsible for
hostage-taking. Bush noted that the United States does not have
ties with either country and said, ``We can't have normal relations
when hostages are held.''
   _Mitterrand said he had proposed a summit of the 16 NATO allies
before the end of the year to discuss the changing face of Europe
and that Bush had concurred in the idea.
   On Lithuania, Bush and Mitterrand joined in calling for dialogue
to end the confrontation between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the leaders of the breakaway Baltic republic.
   Bush said he was ``deeply disturbed'' by Soviet threats to cut
off natural resources from the Baltic republic.
   Lithuania said the cutoff had been put into action Thursday but
Bush said the United States had ``not been able to confirm, oddly,
the exact extent of a Soviet crackdown.''
   ``There is a real need for a dialogue,'' said Mitterrand who
noted that France, like the United States, has never accepted the
incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union.
   Bush said Secretary of State James A. Baker had discussed
Lithuania on Wednesday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   It was the second time in a week that Bush had met with a
Western leader to discuss developments in Eastern Europe. He
traveled to Bermuda to talk with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher last Friday.
   Asked about a U.S. response to Soviet pressure against
Lithuania, Bush said, ``I can't tell you when the U.S. might do
something. But my reluctance stems from trying to keep open a
dialogue and discussion that affects many, many countries.
   ``And I'm talking about arms control. I'm talking about
solidifying the democracies in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said.
   He said he was confident that Gorbachev understood there were
limits to what would be tolerated concerning Lithuania.
   ``I don't think there is any danger that there will be a
misunderstanding on this point,'' said the president. ``None at
all.''
   Bush had earlier warned Moscow not to apply economic pressure
against the Baltic state, saying the United States would react with
``appropriate responses.''
   On another front Thursday, anticipation about a possible hostage
release had been fueled when Syria sent word that one appeared to
be imminent.
   Syria's message added weight to a similar report by the Islamic
Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, the radical group holding
three Americans in Lebanon. The group's message was accompanied by
a photograph of hostage Jesse Turner of Boise, Idaho.
   Bush has tried to entice the kidnappers to release Americans by
pledging repeatedly that goodwill begets goodwill.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had
dispatched a hostage reception team to West Germany to be on hand
at the sprawling U.S. air base at Wiesbaden, likely the first stop
for any hostage freed in the Middle East.
   As for the situation in Lithuania, Fitzwater said Bush was
consulting with major allies about possible responses to Moscow's
actions. In addition to the meeting with Mitterrand, Bush talked by
telephone Wednesday with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``We will be in touch with all of the allies either directly or
through diplomatic channels in the next few days,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if joint action was being considered, Fitzwater said, ``I
wouldn't put it in that category. I think it's more a consultation
about what individual countries might do, what their approach might
be.''
   He said the best guide to a U.S. response was Baker's statement
about possible restrictions of ``bilateral commercial contacts''
with Moscow.
   Baker, testifying before Congress on Wednesday, indicated
arms-control negotiations and U.S.-Soviet talks about regional
conflicts would not be affected.
   Fitzwater said there was some uncertainty about what was
happening in Lithuania, and ``we're still trying to get
verification of the exact situation there.''
   Bush's Florida visit marked the seventh time he has met with
Mitterrand since becoming president. Bush greeted Mitterrand with a
warm handshake as the French president stepped off a helicopter.
Both leaders wore gray suits and ties for the arrival but quickly
changed to casual attire for their talks.
   After Mitterrand's departure, Bush was spending the night here
at the Ocean Reef Club before trips Friday to Republican
fund-raisers in Birmingham, Ala., and Orlando, Fla.
   After that, he was heading back to the Florida Keys for a
weekend of fishing in the Everglades off Islamorada, Fla. The White
House portrayed his weekend as an environmental outing in honor of
Earth Day.

<HEAD>Gov't Wins Passage of Bill Making Hong Kong Residents Citizens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government won a surprisingly easy victory
Thursday night in a crucial vote on a bill to give British
passports and citizenship to an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong
residents.
   The 650-seat House of Commons approved the measure by a vote of
313-216 despite rare opposition from both right-wingers in the
governing Conservative Party opposed to increased immigration and
from the socialist Labor Party, which called the bill elitist.
   The measure now goes to committee for possible amendments and
then back to the House of Commons where political observers say its
passage is virtually assured. It then must pass the unelected House
of Lords.
   The government says it hopes the bill will become law by summer.
   The 97-vote margin of victory in the latest vote was far higher
than political commentators predicted.
   Home Secretary David Waddington had argued that giving British
citizenship to 50,000 key Hong Kong residents and their families
would prevent a brain-drain and maintain confidence in the colony
before it reverts to China in 1997.
   The vote on the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Bill was seen as
one of the toughest tests for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
since she took power nearly 11 years ago, because of the prospect
of a Conservative revolt and Labor opposition.
   The opposition Labor Party told its members to vote against it
on grounds that only Hong Kong's elite will be given passports.
Smaller opposition parties were divided on the bill.
   An initial analysis of the vote showed 44 Conservatives voting
against the government and one Labor member voting for the
government. The number of Labor lawmakers voting against the
government was not immediately available.
   The voting capped an acrimonious and noisy debate in the Commons.
   Under the bill, 50,000 Hong Kong residents in ``good jobs,
earning good salaries'' would be selected on a point system from a
wide variety of fields to receive British passports, Waddington
said.
   ``First and foremost, this is not an immigration bill,'' he
said. ``This is a nationality bill designed to anchor people to
Hong Kong rather than to encourage them to come here.''
   In an angry retort, Former Conservative Party Chairman Norman
Tebbit called for the bill to be thrown out. He warned that it
could lead to rising racial tension and accused the Thatcher
government of reneging on election pledges against large-scale
immigration.
   ``These pledges were made because these islands of ours are
already overcrowded, and in the belief that great waves of
immigration by people who do not share our culture, our language,
our ways of social conduct, in many cases who owe no allegiance to
our culture was, and is, a destablizing factor in society,'' he
said.
   Labor's deputy leader Roy Hattersley objected to the bill
saying, ``The only solution that meets the needs of all the people
is to make major progress toward democracy in the colony.''
   But Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats,
asked whether Hattersley had not learned anything from the Chinese
government crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last
spring.
   ``What (democracy) needs to be supported by is the right of
those people to leave if they wish with a British passport and come
to Britain.''
   About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese now hold a special category
of British passport that do not confer a right to residence in
Britain.

   A Klansman who is challenging a state
law banning public wearing of masks and hoods testified Thursday
that he wore a mask during a one-man protest because he feared for
his life.
   ``I could lose my job ... my family might be in danger, if
people knew I was a Klansman,'' Shade Miller Jr. said during a
hearing in Gwinnett County State Court.
   Miller said he was willing to challenge the 1951 law publicly
because ``I felt it was my freedom of speech. I feel this is
wrong.''
   Representatives of black and Jewish advocacy groups testified
that the anti-mask law has helped reduce Klan violence.
   ``The threat of the Klan is the threat of violence and
terrorism. That's why (the mask) is offensive,'' said Charles
Wittenstein, Southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.
   Earl Shinhoster, Southeastern regional director for the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Georgians
know the Klan wardrobe represents ``harassment, intimidation or
carrying out acts of violence.''
   After the testimony, State Court Judge Howard Cook said he will
rule in about a month on Miller's legal challenge. Miller was
arrested in February on a misdemeanor charge of wearing a mask and
hood in downtown Lawrenceville.
   Miller, of Calhoun, asserted that a proper Ku Klux Klan uniform
includes the hood.
   ``It's one thing. It's like a suit and tie,'' he said.
   Supporters of the law, including civil rights groups, say that
without it the Klan would be free to anonymously terrorize blacks
and other minorities.
   David Fuller, Gwinnett County's chief assistant solicitor,
questioned Miller's assertion that he feared for his job, pointing
out that Miller was unemployed at the time.
   Miller said his boss at his previous truck-driving job had
warned him he would be in ``bad trouble'' if he joined the Klan. He
testified he joined the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan in July 1988.
   Miller's attorney, Michael Hauptman, also called as a witness
Edward K. Fields, a former Klan organizer who said he believed the
use of masks and hoods helped people overcome fears of joining the
KKK.
   In his cross-examination of Wittenstein, Hauptman asked the
B'nai B'rith representative if people would feel threatened by
masked gay rights demonstrators. Wittenstein replied that gay
people do not have the Klan's history of violence.
   Hauptman has argued that the law is too broad, covering people
who would not be perceived as threats.

<HEAD>WHO Chief Asks U.S. Travel Restrictions Dropped on AIDS Carriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the World Health Organization on
Thursday hailed a new, eased U.S. visa policy for participants at a
world AIDS conference in San Francisco, but again asked Washington
to drop all travel restrictions on carriers of the AIDS virus.
   WHO Director General Hiroshi Nakajima also made plain his
concern over U.S. reaction if next month's annual WHO assembly
approves a PLO bid to have the ``State of Palestine'' join WHO as a
member.
   Washington has threatened to cut off funds to any U.N. agency
admitting the Palestine Liberation Organization as a full-fledged
member, arguing that the self-declared state does not meet
internationally accepted norms of statehood.
   The United States contributes $78 million, or 25 percent, to the
1990 regular WHO budget.
   Under a new visa policy announced last week, foreigners coming
to attend certain professional conferences in the United States
will be granted special 10-day visas without having to reveal
whether they are infected with the HIV-virus that causes AIDS.
   Nakajima told a news conference that WHO, co-sponsor of the San
Francisco conference in June, welcomes the new procedures.
   ``However,'' he added in a statement he read before a
question-and-answer session, ``WHO views the situation as not
completely satisfactory and strongly urges the United States to
continue its efforts to drop all travel restrictions against
HIV-infected persons.''
   The U.S. policy was relaxed after several countries and
organizations, including France and Switzerland, said they would
boycott the San Francisco gathering. The European Parliament also
asked scientists not to attend.
   Nakajima also cautioned on Thursday that he was sure the United
States would cease its contributions to the WHO regular budget if
next month's assembly accepts the PLO as a a ``state'' member.
   He said such a cutoff would force reduction of all important
programs operated by WHO.
   More than 100 countries have recognized the ``State of
Palestine'' since it was proclaimed by the PLO's legislative body
in Tunis in 1988.
   Last year, the WHO assembly voted to defer a decision until 1990.
   Nakajima said it was his understanding that a decision by the
U.S. Congress to stop payments to any U.N. agency granting full PLO
membership would not apply to voluntary contributions, such as to
the WHO Global Program on AIDS.
   That program, which has a 1990 budget of $78 million, is
exclusively financed by grants. The United States, which leads the
world in the number of AIDS cases, has pledged to contribute $25
million.
   Nakajima was pressed repeatedly to elaborate on his comments on
the resignation of the American head of the program, Dr. Jonathan
Mann.
   Mann told Nakajima in a letter last month he was not renewing
his contract because of a ``great variance between our positions on
a series of issues'' he considered critical for the global AIDS
strategy.
   Nakajima reiterated there had been no differences on basic
strategy questions. He declined to go into detail, saying entering
``into polemics would not be in the interest of the AIDS program.''
He said he personally had ``very good relations'' with Mann.

<HEAD>GOP Senators Want To Reduce Unions' Political Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republicans said on Thursday they would
write their own campaign finance reform bill to reduce the ability
of labor unions and other groups to spend money on political
activities, including voter registration.
   Republicans, however, were divided on how far to go beyond
Democrats in restricting how much money candidates can take from
labor, corporate and trade association political action committees
that rely on voluntary contributions.
   ``There was no resolution,'' Sen. John Danforth of Missouri said
upon emerging from an hour-long meeting among more than half of the
Senate's 45 Republicans in GOP Leader Bob Dole's office.
   In a bill scheduled to be brought to the Senate floor next week,
Democrats would retain the current $5,000 limit a PAC can
contribute to a candidate for each primary, runoff and general
election but impose a ceiling on the total PAC contributions a
candidate can receive.
   President Bush wants an outright abolition of PACs, which in
recent elections have overwhelmingly favored incumbent lawmakers.
Since Democrats hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they
have enjoyed PAC largesse more than Republicans.
   ``We spent a lot of time talking about the PAC issue and how far
to go,'' Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will manage the
Republican side of the debate, said of the meeting in Dole's
office. ``We disagree on just a very few things, such as how far to
go in bashing PACs.''
   McConnell said Republicans are divided into three camps:
   _Those who want to go along with Bush and abolish PACs outright.
   _Those who would reduce the amount a PAC can contribute to a
candidate for each primary, runoff and general election to $1,000.
   _And those who want to abolish labor and corporate PACs but only
reduce to $1,000 the contribution that issue-oriented, unconnected
PACs, such as those of the National Rife Association, environmental
groups and both sides of the abortion debate.
   An overwhelming majority of the Republicans in the meeting
opposed provisions in the Democratic bill that would basically
impose spending ceilings of $400,000 on House candidates and
$950,000 to $5.5 billion for Senate candidates, depending on the
population of a state, McConnell said.
   However, he said Republicans endorsed the idea of so-called
flexible ceilings that would place no limits on how much a
candidate can raise from home-state residents but would cap
contributions from out-of-state donors.
   ``I still believe that the president _ a former chairman of the
Republican National Committee _ will veto a bill that has spending
limits, in or out of state,'' said McConnell, one of the most
vociferous opponents of ceilings.
   Republicans, he said, are united on abolishing the use of
so-called ``soft'' unreported money by unions and other tax-exempt
organizations for voter registration drives.
   Academic experts have estimated that unions spent up to $45
million of such money in the 1988 election _ almost all of it
benefitting Democrats.
   And it was through a tax-exempt California voter registration
project headed by the son of Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston,
that Phoenix savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. gave
$850,000 of the total $1.3 million contributed to five senators.
   ``If you're tax-exempt, you shouldn't be playing the political
game,'' said Dole. ``If we're really concerned about cleaning up
the campaign sewer money, then it's about time to spray the sewer
stench with a big can of legislative Lysol.''

   A tear-gas grenade exploded Thursday night
outside a religious meeting in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish town,
injuring at least nine people, witnesses and police said.
   An anonymous caller said a Jewish extremist organization carried
out the attack in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei-Brak.
   Officials said the attack came in response to an Orthodox
political party's support to the left-leaning Labor Party, which is
trying to form Israel's next government.
   An Israel Television report showed the site surrounded by dozens
of ultra-Orthodox Jews in traditional long black coats. Police vans
and ambulances with wailing sirens were transporting the injured.
   The television said 11 people were injured by gas inhalation and
one was hit in the head in the scuffle that followed the attack,
but Bnei-Brak Mayor Moshe Irenstein reported only nine injured.
   The grenade exploded outside a hall where hundreds of religious
Jews gathered for a special ceremony to celebrate the end of their
studies of a portion of Talmud, the body of Jewish law and
rabbinical commentaries.
   A police spokeswoman, Ahuva Ivri, said an anonymous caller told
Israel army radio the attack was carried out by the Sicarites, a
radical Jewish group believed responsible for a series of arson
attacks and death threats against leftist and liberal Israelis
advocating peace talks with Palestinians.
   The Sicarites, who take their name from a radical sect that
assassinated opponents in Roman times, claimed responsibility for
the April 1989 shooting outside Jerusalem's walled Old City that
left one Arab dead and three wounded.
   The gathering in Bnei-Brak was organized by the ultra-Orthodox
Agudat Israel Party, which supports the left-leaning Labor in its
attempts to form Israel's next coalition government.
   Labor advocates territorial concessions in peace negotiations
with the Arabs.
   The attack came shortly after a defecting Agudat Israel member,
Abraham Verdiger, announced that he decided to return to his party
and support Labor.
   ``It is possible'' that the attack came in response, said
witness Eliezer Steizberg, an Agudat official.
   The defection of Verdiger and another party member last week
prevented Labor from forming a new government in the 120-member
parliament.
   Irenstein, the mayor, denounced the attack.
   ``We condemn it. Such a thing has never happened at a gathering
devoted to Torah.''
   Irenstein said threats will not deter his political party and
their pledge to form a new government with Labor.
   ``Now, with God's help, we have to succeed.''

<HEAD>EPA Rejects Environmentalists' Pesticide Petition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Thursday rejected a petition from environmentalists asking that any
pesticide that poses even a slight cancer risk be prohibited for
use on processed foods.
   The EPA affirmed its intention not to use the ``zero-tolerance''
standard in cases where the cancer risk is considered negligible.
Several suits are pending before various federal courts challenging
the EPA position.
   Under a provision of the federal pesticide laws, a
cancer-causing pesticide must be prohibited for use on processed
food products if even the slightest residue levels are found. The
``zero tolerance'' standard is called the Delaney Clause after the
congressman who pushed for its enactment.
   The EPA in 1988 concluded that because of modern techniques that
can discern even exceedingly small amounts of pesticide residue, it
would not invoke the Delaney Clause in cases where residue levels
were ``negligible.''
   That prompted several environmental groups, including the
Natural Resources Defense Council, to file a petition challenging
the EPA policy.
   The EPA said Thursday it was denying the petition and would
continue to disregard the Delaney principle in cases where residue
levels are negligible. Agency lawyers have argued that the
government is not legally required to comply with the Delaney
provision in all cases.
   At the same time, however, the EPA acknowleged for the first
time that it would apply the Delaney priciple for so-called ``old''
pesticides _ those that have been approved and later found to cause
cancer _ as long as the residue levels are more than negligible.
   Most pesticides found on processed foods are ``old'' pesticides
so environmentalists characterized that EPA decision to apply the
Delaney principle _ even to a limited extent _ as somewhat of a
victory.
   ``If properly implemented, today's decision will lead to a far
safer food supply,'' said Al Meyerhoff, an attorney for the NRDC.

<HEAD>GAO: Military Doesn't Know What's Buried At U.S. Bases Or Cleanup

   No one knows how much radioactive material is
buried on U.S. military bases, Sen. John Glenn said Thursday as he
released an investigative report with more questions than answers.
   ``None of the three services has a complete grip on what type
and how much low-level radioactive waste it has generated,'' said
Glenn, D-Ohio, who made public a report prepared at his request by
the General Accounting Office.
   Glenn said he wanted the auditors to figure out how much it will
cost the military to deal with its waste, but they didn't have
enough information even to attempt an estimate. All they could say
with certainty was that the cost of disposing of the waste is going
to skyrocket.
   The Army has found that surcharges tacked onto the cost of
disposing of its low-level radioactive waste over the next few
years will be higher than the actual disposal cost and ``We can't
even take a guess as to what the Navy and Air Force may have to pay
because they don't have accurate records,'' Glenn said.
   Glenn's interest in the radioactive waste on military bases was
triggered by a 1986 spill at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near
Dayton, Ohio, that cost the government more than $1 million to
clean up.
   Unmarked drums of radioactive americium-241, which had been
brought illegally onto the base, were accidentally opened,
contaminating a building and exposing some workers.
   After that episode, the Navy and Air Force initiated surveys to
discover how much and what kind of waste was stored at each
installation. But the GAO report said those surveys weren't
completed. Just under half of the installations returned their
survey questionnaires, the report said.
   The Air Force is scheduled this year to begin excavating
low-level radioactive waste buried in the early 1950s. After the
Air Force stopped burying that waste it failed to provide
instructions on maintaining the sites or record-keeping, the report
said.
   ``As a result the Air Force is facing a cleanup situation of
unknown proportions,'' he said.
   The Air Force referred a request for comment to Capt. Sig Adams,
who did not return a telephone message. The GAO report said the
facts in the report were discussed with officials in all three
military branches and ``they generally agreed with the facts.''
   Glenn said he's ``considering various legislative options,'' but
he wants the Pentagon to get a fix on the problem and put a
radioactive waste disposal program in place without having
   ``This points out the problem. It's up to them to do
something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Banks Report Tighter Lending Practices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of large banks responding to a
survey said they had tightened their lending practices for real
estate loans in the last six months, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said.
   Greenspan said the Federal Reserve, which regulates bank holding
companies, had surveyed 60 of the country's largest banks in
January to determine whether it was easier or harder for businesses
to obtain credit.
   A ``large majority'' of the banks said they had become less
willing to make construction and land development loans during the
past six months, Greenspan said in written responses released
Thursday by the Senate Banking Committee.
   Greenspan did not provide a specific percentage figure, but said
that ``most'' banks responding to the survey also had tightened
standards for making merger-related loans or loans to businesses
with lower credit ratings.
   One-fifth of the banks said they were less willing to make
general business loans, Greenspan said.
   The banks blamed the tighter credit policies primarily on the
economy's weakness late last year, which made them scrutinize loan
requests more carefully. Other factors cited by the banks were
rising numbers of bad loans and closer scrutiny by banking
regulators.
   Many small and medium-sized businesses have complained they are
facing a severe credit crunch at present as financial institutions
are forced to tighten credit practices under pressure from federal
regulators who have become more strict in the wake of the giant
savings and loan bailout.
   Greenspan's comments came in response to a question submitted by
Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who said many businesses in his state
were complaining about their inability to get credit.
   Greenspan said the Fed was aware that banks in New England and
other areas of the country had tightened their lending standards.
He said such a development could have an impact on overall economic
activity in a region.
   But he said for the lending slowdown to pose serious threats to
the health of the economy it would need to be more severe than what
the Fed has detected and extend for a longer period of time.
   Greenspan said it was essential for banks to meet the financing
needs of their communities but in a prudent manner.
   ``As recent experience has shown, there are substantial costs
associated with both too much restraint and with too little,'' he
said. ``We (federal regulators) are attempting to strike the proper
balance.''

<TEXT>
   When Imelda Marcos visited New York in 1983, she
put $1 million toward a Michelangelo painting and spent millions
more on jewelry, documents in evidence at her fraud trial show.
   During a visit a year later, she spent $55 at McDonald's. Other
expenses included a $19,400 order of nightgowns, towels,
tablecloths and bedsheets and a hotel bill at the Waldorf Astoria
for $18,401.
   The purchases were logged in stenographer notebooks kept by Mrs.
Marcos' personal secretary, Fe Roa Jimenez, during Mrs. Marcos'
trips to the United States in the early 1980s.
   The notebooks, entered in evidence Tuesday, were found in the
Philippine presidential palace in 1986 after Mrs. Marcos' husband,
Ferdinand E. Marcos, was ousted as president and they fled to
Hawaii.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is on trial on charges she and her late husband
bought four New York properties and financed a lavish lifestyle
between 1981 and 1983 with more than $160 million allegedly
embezzled from their homeland's treasury.
   Many of Ms. Jimenez's handwritten entries were for jewelry
purchases _ such as a $200,000 diamond bracelet and $360,000 for
antique jewelry.
   The biggest single expenditure during the May 1983 trip was the
$1 million payment toward the unidentified Michelangelo painting,
leaving a $2.5 million balance.
   During a 1984 visit to New York, Mrs. Marcos spent $13,284 in a
single day at Bloomingdale's department store, according to a
ledger. Food expenses ranged from $55.95 for hamburgers and fish
fillets at McDonald's to $305 for lunch at a Manhattan restaurant
two days later.
   In testimony Thursday, a former Philippine banking official said
the Marcoses worried about their country's diminished U.S. dollar
reserves while they allegedly bought Manhattan real estate with
embezzled government funds.
   Jaime Laya, who served as governor of the Philippine Central
Bank from 1981 to 1984, testified that he discussed with President
Marcos in September 1983 ways to obtain private loans to replenish
the treasury because banks were reluctant to lend the country money.
   Marcos also was charged in the 1988 indictment along with his
wife. He died last September in exile in Hawaii.
   Another witness, former Philippine National Bank official Oscar
Carino, said that Jimenez asked him for as much as $500,000 in cash
during each of Mrs. Marcos' trips to New York. Prosecutors have
described the bank's New York office as Mrs. Marcos' ``own personal
piggy bank.''
   The notebooks revealed bits and pieces of Mrs. Marcos' social
activities, including Broadway shows, and contained references to
numerous celebrities such as singer Julio Iglesias, actor George
Hamilton and industrialist Armand Hammer.
   One notation concerned a request by former Philippine Sen.
Benigno Aquino Jr. to meet with Mrs. Marcos in New York on May 12,
1983. Aquino, a Marcos foe then living in exile in the United
States, was murdered at the Manila airport when he returned home
three months later.
   In his testimony Thursday, Laya said he attended a meeting at
the Marcoses' official residence in Manila at which Mrs. Marcos
asked prominent Filipino businessmen to use their contacts abroad
to help the Philippines in its time of crisis.
   The meeting resulted in Marcos' decision to issue treasury bonds
in U.S. dollar denominations that would be repaid with interest in
two years, Laya said.
   When the treasury bonds did not immediately spur investments,
Laya said he asked Marcos for help, and a few days later, three
foreign banks bought bonds worth $75 million.
   The witness said $15 million came from Banque Paribas, a Swiss
institution where prosecutors claim the Marcoses held secret
accounts for funds allegedly stolen from their homeland's treasury.
   Laya, who testified with immunity for the prosecution, served on
Marcos' cabinet as Minister of Education, Culture and Sports from
1984 until February 1986 when Marcos was ousted from power.
   In his position as the Central Bank's governor, Laya supervised
the regulation of the country's money supply.

   Relatives of Americans held hostage in Lebanon reacted with
weary sadness to the news Thursday that the release of one of the
captives had been indefinitely postponed.
   ``I've had my hopes shattered so many times in the past three
and a half years that I cannot say that it was unexpected,''
hostage Robert Polhill's mother, Ruth Polhill of Fishkill, N.Y.,
said in a telephone interview.
   ``Nothing has come on the dates they say it would be coming,''
she said.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said Wednesday
that it would release one of the three U.S. educators it has held
since 1987.
   But on Thursday, the pro-Iranian group said in a statement that
it was postponing the release because the United States refused to
meet its demand that John Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern affairs, fly to Damascus, Syria, to coordinate
final arrangements.
   
   The group holds Polhill, Jesse Turner, and Alann Steen, but
didn't say which one it had planned to release. An instant
photograph of Turner was released with Wednesday's communique;
Thursday's announcement was accompanied by a photo of Polhill.
   ``Regardless of which of the men is going to be released, I will
be happy,'' Mrs. Polhill said. ``But it looks like a long haul.''
   ``We've very sad,'' Steen's mother-in-law, Dorothy Rose of Clark
Lake, Mich., said in an interview with Detroit television station
WDIV-TV. ``You have your hopes up any time something like this
happens.''
   ``It gives me a very bad letdown,'' Turner's mother, Estelle
Ronneburg, said in a telephone interview in Boise, Idaho. ``I may
not go as high and as low as I used to, but it's still hard. ...
This seemed to be the time he was going to be released.''
   Steen, Polhill and Turner were abducted from the Beirut
University College campus on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Turner, 42, taught mathematics and computer science. Polhill,
55, of New York, was a lecturer in accounting. Steen, a journalism
professor born in Arcata, Calif., and a former resident of Boston,
turns 51 Sunday.
   Eight Americans are among the Western hostages held in Lebanon
by pro-Iranian groups. The longest-held is 42-year-old Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who has traveled and spoken widely
to win freedom for her brother, on Thursday criticized the U.S.
government's refusal to send Kelly to Syria.
   ``God knows I have heard from the White House, `We will go
anywhere and we will talk to anybody.' And I am totally puzzled by
the attitude of reluctance to move forward and get on with this,''
she said in an interview with CBS News. ``If they want John Kelly,
send them John Kelly.''
   ``I don't know the reasons for them not sending him,'' said Mrs.
Ronneburg, who said the State Department contacted her Wednesday
and Thursday before the release fell through.
   ``The reasons may be very good reasons but they haven't told me
the reasons,'' she said.
   In a news conference in Key Largo, Fla., on Thursday, President
Bush repeated that he will not meet the demands of kidnappers.
   ``The United States does not knuckle under to demands,'' Bush
said when asked why he did not dispatch Kelly to Damascus.

<TEXT>
   Nine years of civil war that took
30,000 lives appeared near an end Thursday when Contra guerrillas,
leftist Sandinistas and the incoming government agreed to a truce
and a deadline for the rebels to disarm.
   ``With this accord we conclude the peace process that started
with the elections,'' said Antonio Lacayo, senior negotiator for
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, after the accords were
read at a dawn news conference.
   However, President Daniel Ortega cautioned late Thursday that
the war is not over ``as long as those accords are not fulfilled.''
He spoke after meeting with Bernard Aronson, assistant U.S.
secretary of state of inter-American affairs.
   The accord sets a cease-fire that began at noon Thursday; the
withdrawal of Sandinista military forces at least 12 miles from the
borders of five security zones, to be completed by Saturday; and
the immediate gathering of all Contra fighters within the zones.
About 9,000 Contras fighters are in Nicaragua.
   An addendum said the Contras will start turning in their weapons
on Wednesday afternoon, April 25, after Mrs. Chamorro takes office
from President Daniel Ortega, with the Contra fighting force to be
disbanded completely by June 10.
   Missions from the United Nations and the Organization of
American States _ as well as Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando
y Bravo _ were charged with supervising the cease-fire and
demobilization.
   The accord, completed after 14 hours of negotiations, does not
meet the Sandinista Front's demand that the Contras disband by
April 25.
   But it also makes no mention of what had been a key Contra
demand _ that the Sandinista People's Army be neutralized as a
condition for the rebels to surrender their weapons.
   Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition alliance clearly
gained the most from the agreement _ the opportunity to start its
government in peace, instead of in the middle of civil war, bitter
recriminations or anti-government strikes, as had been feared.
   After nine years of civil war that cost 30,000 people their
lives in a country of 3 million, each side was suspicious of the
other's motives and neither wanted to be the first to put down its
weapons.
   The army is controlled by the Sandinista party, and the Contras
insisted that they wouldn't disarm until they were sure Mrs.
Chamorro had full control of the government and it was safe for
them to return home.
   Under a protocol with Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, the Sandinistas
agreed to depoliticize the army and reduce its size. In exchange,
the incoming government promised to ``respect the integrity and
professionalism'' of the army.
   Some Sandinistas appeared disappointed the accord did not call
for the immediate disbanding of the Contras, and a mob of youths
chanting anti-Contra slogans surrounded a car carrying Aronson
hours after the agreement was signed.
   The U.S. Embassy vehicle was ringed as it left Managua's
airport. The mob beat on the car's windows, but was startled by a
loud bang like a firecracker and the vehicle was able to leave.
   Aronson later met with Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro for several
hours each, but commented only after talking with Mrs. Chamorro,
saying they had discussed ``economics, the transition, the peace
process'' and President Bush's proposed $300 million aid package.
   Washington backed the Contras in their war but supported Mrs.
Chamorro's call for their dissolution.
   Sandinista army Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and
brother of the president, said he was satisfied with what he called
a peace effort reached ``in a profound, serious way, with a great
spirit of responsibility.''
   ``Let it be clear that what has been signed here is something
serious, something formal, and I think that we all have the good
will to fulfill this signed document,'' said Oscar Sovalbarro, the
Contras' senior negotiator.
   Lacayo, Gen. Ortega and Sovalbarro, along with Obando y Bravo,
the archbishop of Managua, signed the main Contra agreement.
   A separate accord was reached between the Sandinista army and
the Yatama Atlantic Front, the Miskito Indian rebel contingent
fighting the Sandinistas in Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast region.
   The Yatama accord calls for a cease-fire covering the sparsely
populated eastern half of Nicaragua to start at midnight Thursday.
The rebel Indians have two separate security zones, and they are to
disband by May 18.
   Gen. Ortega said ``technical and operational hurdles'' made it
logistically impossible to meet an April 25 deadline for disbanding
the Contras.
   Making the Contras disarm by inauguration day had become nearly
an obsession with the Sandinistas, who were trounced in the Feb. 25
election. However, Gen. Ortega dismissed the failure to have the
Contras disarm immediately.
   ``The delay is nothing if we compare it to the tragedy and
suffering that we have had to endure during these years of war,''
he said.

   A 17th-century Sicilian table fountain sold for
$1.98 million Thursday, an auction record for a piece of silver,
Christie's said.
   The decorative centerpiece, crafted in 1670 by Giuseppe d'Angelo
of Messina, was bought by a London silver dealer identified as
Armitage, said Doris Athineos, a spokeswoman for the auction house.
   The seller's identity was withheld, she said.
   The 22-inch-high, two-tiered centerpiece supported by four
horses is based on Giovanni Montolorsoli's marble fountain of Orion.
   It was auctioned for $1,500 in 1947 from the estate of J.P.
Morgan.
   The previous auction record for a piece of silver was believed
to be a pair of candelabra that sold for $1.5 million in 1989 at
Sotheby's, the spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on
Thursday warned the United States against actions such as the
alleged abduction of a Mexican doctor for trial in the murder of a
U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Salinas said his nation has joined the battle against drug
trafficking in good faith, ``but we will not permit anybody, not
drug traffickers nor their pursuers, to violate Mexican rights.''
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, a suspect in the 1985
torture-slaying of Camarena, was arrested April 3 in El Paso,
Texas. His U.S. lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said Alvarez was
kidnapped at his office in Guadalajara the previous day.
   ``In the fight against drugs, the law is rendered useless by
illegal actions, or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of
one country in foreign territory,'' Salinas told an international
conference on drug trafficking.
   Mexico has asked the United States to explain how Alvarez got to
El Paso, and U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said an
investigation is being conducted.
   Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said
Wednesday the incident might hinder U.S.-Mexico cooperation in the
drug war.
   Thornburgh and his Mexican counterpart met privately Thursday
and a U.S. Justice Department statement said without elaborating
that the two nations would continue working together.
   The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday quoted unidentified Mexican
sources as saying agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration's
Los Angeles office arranged to kidnap Alvarez without the knowledge
of their superiors in Washington.
   A senior Salinas administration official told The Associated
Press that Mexican officials believe Alvarez was abducted by bounty
hunters and that Mexican police were not involved.
   Alvarez, 42, is one of 19 Mexicans indicted by a U.S. grand jury
in Los Angeles on charges of kidnapping, torturing and killing
Camarena in 1985. He was arraigned earlier this month and pleaded
innocent.
   In Mexico, two drug lords, Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto
Fonseca, have been convicted and sentenced to long terms in the
Camarena killing.
   Although Salinas mentioned neither the United States nor Alvarez
by name in his speech to an international anti-drug conference at
this coastal resort, his meaning was clear.
   ``The fight against drug trafficking can't be used as an excuse
to violate the law in a country's own territory, and much less so
in a foreign nation's territory,'' said Salinas.
   ``Mexico fights drug trafficking because it considers it a
menace to the security of the state and a threat to the health of
our families and our youth,'' Salinas told the conference, which
drew representatives from 32 nations.
   The Alvarez arrest has drawn protests from Mexicans who cite it
as an example of U.S. highhandedness. Opponents have tried to rally
nationalist sentiment by saying Salinas is letting the United
States take advantage of Mexico on trade, drugs and other issues.
   In his speech to the conference, Thornburgh made no mention of
the Alvarez incident but praised the Salinas administration's
commitment to the war on drugs.
   ``We have demonstrable proof of the Mexican authorities' resolve
to deal with these problems. Mexico has brought to justice several
of the world's most notorious drug kingpins. Mexico has become a
leader in promoting international cooperation,'' Thornburgh said.
   In a written statement, Thornburgh said his office has begun a
full investigation.
   ``Until I have received that report, it would be premature to
comment,'' Thornburgh added in a brief interview with reporters.
   Asked how Alvarez appeared in the United States, a member of the
American delegation said an answer would have to await the report
to Thornburgh.
   ``All we know is that a plane arrived in El Paso, and the DEA
met the plane,'' said the official.

   The state Board of Elections certified April 9 that Rosemary
Mulligan defeated state Rep. Penny Pullen in the March 20 GOP
primary for the northwestern suburban district, by 7,431 votes to
7,400.
   Ms. Pullen, in her petition in Cook County Circuit Court, said a
partial recount showed her winning. Ms. Mulligan claims a separate
partial recount conducted by her campaign confirmed her victory.
   Ms. Pullen has gained national recogntion in the GOP for her
conservatism on social issues. President Bush recently nominated
her to the board of the Legal Services Corporation. Several
national abortion-rights groups that had targeted Ms. Pullen helped
fund Ms. Mulligan's campaign.
   A court hearing is scheduled April 30. If Ms. Pullen convinces a
judge she should be the winner, the judge could order a full
recount.
   Ms. Mulligan, a paralegal, contends Ms. Pullen's attempt to
reverse the results are a ploy to scare off financial backing for
her run against the Democratic primary winner in the Nov. 6
election.

<HEAD>OSHA Issues $6.4 Million Fine Against Companies in Pasadena
Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials Thursday proposed $6.4 million
in fines against Phillips 66 Co. and a contractor in connection
with a Texas chemical plant explosion that killed 23 workers and
injured 124 last October.
   The proposed fines of $5.67 million against Phillips and
$729,600 against Fish Engineering and Construction Inc. would be
the second largest for a single inspection by the federal
Occupational Health and Safety Administration.
   OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful violations and nine serious
violations at the Houston Chemical Complex in suburban Pasadena.
The agency accused Fish Engineering, a maintenence contractor at
the plant, of 181 willful violations, 12 serious violations and one
of mismanaging records.
   A series of explosions Oct. 23 destroyed the section of the
plant that makes polyethylene, which is used to make plastics.
Twenty-three workers were killed and 124 were hurt.
   ``We conducted an extensive investigation of what caused this
catastrophe,'' said Gilbert Saulter, OSHA's Southwest regional
administrator.
   He said the agency determined that the explosion would not have
occurred ``had Phillips provided a safe workplace'' by following
OSHA and industry standards.
   Phillips and Fish Engineering have 15 days to contest the fines.
   ``At no time has Phillips ever compromised the safety of its
employees,'' the company said in a statement. ``Based on
preliminary information, we do plan to contest a number of the
citations and we do take issue with OSHA characterizing any of the
violations as willful acts.''
   Phillips 66 is the chemical production and marketing arm of
Phillips Petroleum Co.
   Fish Engineering said in a statement that it also would contest
the fines.
   However, the statement said OSHA's investigation ``confirmed
that the Houston contractor did not cause or contribute to the
explosion ...''
   Saulter said one of the major problems at the plant included the
lack of a double-valve system as a failsafe on gas emissions.
   Phillips officials have said the explosion occurred after a seal
on a polyethylene reactor ruptured, leaking highly flammable
ethylene and isobutane gas from a pipeline. It was unclear what
ignited the gas.
   Workers reported that only a few seconds elapsed between the
time they spotted a cloud of gas, heard warning sirens and were
rocked by explosions.
   Saulter said the deficiencies described as willful violations
fell into three categories: failure to prevent the release of
flammable vapors, failure to minimize or mitigate the consequences
of a release, and failure to provide adequate fire protection.
   The serious violations include inadequate emergency exits and
emergency planning, inaudible emergency alarm sire and deficiencies
in hazard communications and respiratory protection programs.
   Phillips Petroleum President Glenn Cox said the company's
investigation showed the explosion ``was the result of a departure
from established routine procedures.
   ``We are thoroughly evaluating our procedures and training to
determine how the possibility for error can be further minimized,''
Cox said in a statement issued from company headquarters in
Bartlesville, Okla.
   Saulter said Phillips officials already have contacted OSHA
about the reconstruction of the plant and possible modifications at
the site, but declined to give specifics of the talks.
   He said Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is expected to give
President Bush a report in the coming weeks about the accident,
what should be done at the new plant and what changes might be
needed at other plants across the country.
   The largest fine ever sought by OSHA was proposed last November,
when the government said it was seeking $7.3 million from USX Corp.
for 2,000 alleged safety violations at a steel plant near
Pittsburgh and another on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware
River near Trenton, N.J. USX has contested the fine.

   Prosecutors said Thursday a senior
diplomat was arrested as a spy, the fourth government employee
seized this month and accused of providing secrets to East
Germany's former Communist rulers.
   The 54-year-old suspect, indentified only by the initials H.B.,
spied for East German intelligence since 1961 and is believed to
have passed on information while posted at embassies in Cairo,
Tokyo, London and Vienna, said spokesman Rolf Hannich of the chief
federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe.
   Hannich said the diplomat, whose rank was not revealed, was said
to have furnished ``vast amounts of information'' to East Germany
before being arrested Wednesday.
   Hannich said the Constitutional Protection Office, the nation's
highest spy-fighting unit, helped uncover the diplomat's activities.
   West German newspapers said changes in East Germany have helped
West Germany's counter-intelligence efforts. News media say West
German spy-fighters have been receiving useful tips from former
East German agents.
   A week earlier, Hannich announced the arrests of two other West
German government employees suspected of spying for East Germany _
another Foreign Ministry employee and a high-ranking official for
the federal border police.
   On April 5, the federal prosecutor's office announced the arrest
of a 45-year-old man working for the West German NATO mission in
Brussels.
   Spiegel magazine identified that suspect as Heinz-Helmuth
Werner, a former West German soldier, and said he delivered a
bonanza of classified information to the East Germans and the
Soviet KGB.
   In Ankara, the capital of Turkey, the Turkish government on
Thursday decided to recall 15 Turkish diplomats from West Germany,
following allegations in the West German press they engaged in
espionage.
   Turkey also asked West Germany to remove eight of its diplomats
from Turkey.

<HEAD>Developer of Practical Method For Freezing, Thawing Blood Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Charles E. Huggins, who developed a method for
freezing and thawing donated blood so it can be stored almost
indefinitely, has died of cancer of the pancreas. He was 60.
   Huggins, who died Wednesday, was director of the Massachusetts
General Hospital Blood Transfusion Service and taught at Harvard
Medical School.
   He developed a technique for freezing blood donated to blood
banks by adding glycerol, which acts like an organic antifreeze, to
red blood cells that have been separated from other blood
components. The cells can be thawed years later and the glycerol
removed by a sugar compound, the hospital said.
   In 1963, Huggins developed a Cytoglomerator _ a machine that
freezes the red blood cells and removes the glycerol. The machine
was widely used until the 1980s, when it was replaced by automated
equipment.
   Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, general director of Massachusetts
General, said in a prepared statement that Huggins was ``one of the
world's luminaries in blood banking.''
   Huggins became director of the hospital's blood transfusion
service in 1973. He was also an associate professor of surgery at
Harvard Medical School.
   Born in Chicago, Huggins was the son of Dr. Charles B. Huggins,
a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. He received his bachelor's
degree from the University of Chicago in 1947 and graduated from
Harvard Medical School in 1952 at age 23.
   He was trained in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and
later practiced there as a general surgeon.
   Huggins is survived by his father, his wife, Gareth W. Huggins,
and five children.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills told the Japanese foreign minister on Thursday that Japan
must lower trade barriers on U.S. timber products or face possible
sanctions.
   She and Japan's Taro Nakayama discussed U.S.-Japanese trade
issues at a breakfast meeting.
   The two are attending a three-day conference of nations and
organizations which belong to GATT, the General Agreement on
Tarriffs and Trade.
   ``There's still a lot to be done between now and April 30,'' the
date Hills could call for retaliatory measures, Torie Clarke, a
U.S. Trade Office spokeswoman said Hills told Nakayama.
   U.S. timber representatives estimate their industry could earn
up to $3 billion more a year if Japan would revise building codes,
reclassify lumber categories and lower taxes.
   Japan now imports only raw lumber. U.S. exporters want to sell
Japan processed products, such as boards.
   The United States has been trying to untangle a related wood
products dispute with Canada for about 10 years.
   ``A great amount of advancement has been made'' in U.S.-Japanese
trade talks, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Makoto Yamanaka
told a news conference.
   ``What's needed at this point is the final touch.''
   Another sticking point is Japan's practice of allowing stores to
rent foreign recordings without paying royalties to record makers.
   Nakayama told Hills he hopes to introduce new regulations
protecting foreign copyrights, Yamanaka said.
   Currently, records released in the United States with patents
before 1978 can be legally rented in Japan.
   Arthur Dunkel, director of GATT, told The Associated Press he is
happy to see bilateral negotiations between parties to the foreign
trade treaty when the negotiations lead to lowering trade barriers
such as taxes and permit requirements, the object of the
42-year-old international agreement.
   Canada, one of 96 signers of GATT, has hinted it would propose
forming a world trade organization that would help promote GATT
interests.
   Yamanaka said Japan has not discussed the proposal.

<HEAD>Marla Maples: I Love Donald Trump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Model Marla Maples, who was rumored to be the
other woman in the split-up of Donald and Ivana Trump, admitted
that she loves Trump during a televised interview aired Thursday.
   ``I do love him,'' Maples answered when asked whether she had a
romance with the billionaire real estate developer in an interview
with Diane Sawyer on ABC's ``Prime Time Live.''
   ``I can't lie about it. Oh, I do,'' she added.
   The segment was taped Wednesday in a house in Atlantic City,
N.J., where Trump recently opened the glitzy Taj Mahal casino.
   Asked if she talked with Trump about marriage, Maples replied,
``No. He's a friend. ... He has a family and that's No. 1 to him, I
know.''
   Was she the reason for the Trump split? ``Only the two of them
know what really went wrong with their marriage. But I'm not the
reason for that marriage having problems,'' she said, adding: ``As
Donald has said himself, `People just grow apart.'''
   Maples would not discuss how she met Trump, nor would she talk
about a reputed confrontation she had with Ivana Trump in Aspen,
Colo., where the Trumps vacationed last year.
   Of Ivana Trump, Maples said: ``I feel like she's gone through a
lot of pain. I can only imagine what it's like to have your whole
world as you knew it sort of shaken and put out there for everyone
to see.''
   She called Mrs. Trump ``an absolutely beautiful woman.''
   Maples said she speaks with Trump ``every once in awhile. He
just wants to know how we're doing. I mean, he has a lot of
sympathy for how we've been besieged by this.'' She was referring
to her family.
   ``And I think he wants to see me come out looking OK. He's very
sorry. I think he sees that I've been a victim in the press that
all started from his, his personal life.''
   Maples said Trump approved of her doing the interview. ``I made
sure of that.''
   She added: `` My family has been so besieged by the press, and I
feel like it's time that I step out and I take the heat for a bit
for what they've had to go through.''

<HEAD>Former Panamanian President's Son Denies Threatening Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The son of a former Panamanian president
said Thursday that he was joking when he told a pawnbroker he had
``a bullet with Bush's name engraved on it.''
   But the Secret Service took Otto Lakas at his word and he was
being held without bail on a federal charge of threatening to kill
the president.
   ``I was not serious. Not at all,'' Otto Lakas said in an
jailhouse interview. ``I didn't do anything. I am very confused.
All I know is that I am in jail.''
   Lakas, a 21-year-old architecture student at Lubbock Christian
University, was arrested Tuesday after a Secret Service
investigation. Police said Lakas had no previous record.
   According to court documents from the Secret Service, Lakas
tried to buy a .357 Colt revolver at the Exect Pawn Shop and told
clerk Stacy Nichols, ``I have a .223-caliber rifle at home and a
bullet with Bush's name engraved on it.
   ``Bush is coming to Lubbock and I will blow his ... head off.''
   The White House has announced no plans for a Bush visit to
Lubbock, although Bush is scheduled to visit Dallas, Houston and
Austin in May.
   Federal agents say Lakas was upset over last December's U.S.
invasion of Panama, which resulted in the arrest of Panama's
leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, on drug charges.
   ``The U.S. got a bad guy but a lot of good people were hurt,'' a
Secret Service affidavit quoted Lakas as saying to Nichols, who
twice refused to sell him a gun.
   Lakas' father, Demetrio B. Lakas, was figurehead president of
Panama from 1972 to 1978, during the time Panama was ruled by Gen.
Omar Torrijos.
   Noriega was a disciple of Torrijos and gained ascendancy in the
military after the popular leader died in a 1981 plane crash.
   Lakas' brother, Basilio, on Wednesday told the Texas Tech
student newspaper, The University Daily, that ``the whole thing is
a misunderstanding, and there is no reason to blow it out of
proportion.''
   In the affidavit for a search warrant, the Secret Service said
Lakas tried on April 2 to buy a Colt revolver at the pawnshop but
was turned away by Nichols because he did not have a Texas driver's
license or a state identification card.
   On April 4, Lakas went back to the same pawnshop, produced a
Texas identification card and told Nichols he wanted to send the
weapon to his father in Panama, according to the affidavit.
   When Nichols told Lakas that he could go to jail for making a
threat against Bush, Lakas said, ``they will not mess with me''
because of his family connections in Panama, according to the
Secret Service.
   Nichols told Lakas to think about buying the gun and return
later. Lakas did not return, but called Nichols later to say he no
longer wanted to buy the gun, court documents said.
   ``Most pawnbrokers would not have thought twice about taking
$850 for the gun, which is what he offered to pay for it,'' Nichols
said Thursday. ``But I said no. I was just doing my civic duty.''
   Nichols said he waited two weeks to tell federal agents about it
because he feared reprisals by Lakas. He notified authorities on
Monday.
   The Secret Service said agents searched Lakas' house Tuesday and
found a stun gun and a BB-gun.

<TEXT>
   State lawmakers broke a deadlock Thursday
on school financing that would raise teachers' salaries, ending a
strike that idled classes for more than 300,000 students this week.
   As striking teachers crowded the halls of the Capitol and
thousands more rallied outside, senators approved an emergency
clause on a $230 million education reform and tax bill shortly
before 6 p.m. The bill was sent to Gov. Henry Bellmon, who said he
would sign the bill at an undetermined date.
   The emergency clause, which allows the bill to become law as
soon as it is signed, had been a stumbling block to the package.
The Senate failed last week to pass it, prompting the Oklahoma
Education Association to call for a five-day teacher walkout.
   The bill calls for spending $68.1 million to raise minimum
teacher salaries by $1,500 a year for four years. The bill would
not increase the salaries of teachers above the minimums, but $212
million budgeted for schools could be used for teacher salaries and
other items.
   Oklahoma teachers rank 48th in pay among the states, making an
average of $22,000 a year. The national average is $29,648. In
Oklahoma, the minimum beginning teacher's salary with a bachelor
degree is $15,060.
   ``A new day is dawning for education in Oklahoma,'' Bellmon said
after the vote. ``Oklahoma will no longer take a back seat among
the states where education is concerned. From now on, others can
look to Oklahoma for leadership in education.''
   Union officials said the passage would end the walkout, which
was in its fourth day Thursday. It was unclear if regular classes
would held Friday.
   Teachers in districts already closed for the week planned to
hold a ``thank you'' rally at the Capitol on Friday, said Nancy
Jewell, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Education Association.
   Thousands of teachers as well as some administrators, parents
and students protested earlier Thursday over the legislative
stalemate on a bill that calls for raising the state sales tax and
increasing personal and corporate income taxes to pay for the
education reforms.
   A half-cent increase in the 4-cent state sales tax increase
would raise $104 million, as would a 10 percent increase in
personal income taxes. An increase in the corporate tax from 5
percent to 6 percent would produce $22 million.
   A compromise that would give tax rebates to low-income families
led to the passage of the emergency clause. As the vote on the
clause was announced shortly before 6 p.m., a loud cheer broke out
in the Senate gallery.
   The need to resolve the stalemate had taken on an added urgency
after Senate President Pro Tempore Bob Cullison, a Democrat, said
he might adjourn the special session Thursday, effectively killing
the measure.
   Senate Appropriations Chairman Stratton Taylor, a Democrat,
earlier brought cheers from protesting teachers when he told a
rally of more than 10,000 that Democratic senators were meeting and
might have a solution after a day of closed caucuses.
   The Oklahoma Education Association, which called for the walkout
last week, said 145 school districts in the state were closed
Thursday. Among those were Tulsa, Oklahoma City and Lawton, the
three largest districts in the state with about 95,000 students.
   State education officials have said the walkout has affected
about 60 percent, or 343,200, of the state's 572,000 students have
been affected. The state has 606 school districts.
   Some schools have remained open throughout the week, while
others have been closed the entire time. In some instances, parents
and businessmen have made the trek to the Capitol while teachers
have stayed in the classroom.
   The OEA represents 31,000 of the state's estimated 35,000
teachers.
   The Democratic majority apparently was not involved in any
negotiations with Republicans, who voted against the education
reform and tax bill earlier, causing the stalemate.
   Thursday's demonstrators, undaunted by rain and soggy grounds,
staged the most boisterous rally of the week.
   Sen. Taylor touched off a round of chants that echoed through
the Capitol area when he proposed a new motto: ``Never Last Again.''
   ``I don't believe the people of Oklahoma want to be at the
bottom of the heap in salaries _ or educational funding,'' said
House Speaker Steve Lewis, who is the principal author of the
education package.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Will Not Seek Charges In Drowning Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No criminal charges will be filed in
the February drowning deaths of three teen-agers from a probation
camp who fell into an icy lake and four men who tried to rescue
them, prosecutors said.
   Mono County District Attorney Stan Eller said in a memo to the
sheriff Tuesday that he felt there was insufficient evidence to
prosecute the camp's operator, Camp O'Neal Inc., or any individual.
   Three juvenile offenders housed at Camp O'Neal fell through thin
ice and drowned during an outing to frigid Convict Lake in the
Sierra Nevada on Feb. 19. Two counselors and two other adults
drowned trying to save them.
   Although the district attorney's investigation clears the camp
operator of criminal wrongdoing, a civil complaint filed by the
state Department of Social Services is still pending.
   The complaint alleges inadequate supervision leading to the
drownings, sexual misconduct, overmedicating the juvenile offenders
and not properly maintaining medical records. A hearing is
scheduled for Aug. 16.
   The group home, licensed by the state to treat emotionally
troubled youths, has been closed since the complaint was filed
March 16.
   Camp O'Neal had been cited before the Convict Lake tragedy for
several violations of state licensing standards, according to
Department of Social Services spokeswoman Kathleen Norris.
   The camp's director, Bobbi Trott, has denied any wrongdoing in
the drownings or other alleged incidents at the camp.

   The lawyer who filed incorporation papers for
the Bronx social club where 87 people died in a fire is a city
police lieutenant who is now himself under investigation, according
to a published report.
   Lt. Primo Flores was moonlighting as a lawyer when he listed the
Happy Land club as a not-for-profit corporation in the 1988 papers,
The New York Times reported in Thursday editions.
   Nothing suggests Flores knew the club would sell liquor
illegally and operate in violation of city orders that it close
because of building violations, the Times said.
   Police told the Times that the investigation is aimed at
determining whether Flores adhered to departmental requirements to
disclose his outside business activities and whether he had
committed any wrongdoing in his work for the club.
   Flores' role in setting up the club has been under investigation
by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division since shortly
after the March 25 fire, the Times said.
   The 48-year-old Flores, a policeman since 1967, works in the
Police Department's Advocate office, which prosecutes departmental
charges against police officers accused of breaking regulations.
   Flores did not return calls requesting comment, the Times said.
   A Cuban immigrant, Julio Gonzalez, has been charged with setting
the deadly blaze after a dispute with his girlfriend, who worked at
the club as a coat checker.
   The club had been operating in violation of vacate orders issued
after city inspectors discovered there was no second exit, no fire
alarms and inadequate sprinklers.

   A federal bankruptcy judge appointed a trustee
to take over Eastern Airlines, delighting striking union members
with the knowledge that Frank Lorenzo no longer will pilot the
company.
   ``Justice has finally been served by stopping the most renowned
corporate pirate of the past decade,'' said Michael J. Flynn,
president of a union local representing about 2,000 striking
Machinists in Atlanta.
   Judge Burton R. Lifland late Wednesday granted the request of
Eastern's unsecured creditors, who sought a trustee because of
frustration over the carrier's mounting losses and its plans to cut
payments to creditors.
   ``The flying public's interest must at all times be taken into
account,'' Lifland told a packed courtroom. ``It's time to change
the captain of Eastern's crew.''
   The judge appointed as trustee Martin Shugrue, a pilot and
airline executive who formerly worked for Lorenzo, chairman of

   Soaring health care costs could bankrupt the
Medicare trust fund that pays for hospital care before the turn of
the century, the fund's board of trustees says.
   In its annual report to Congress, the board said ``early
corrective action is essential in order to avoid the need for
later, potentially precipitous changes.''
   The hospital insurance trust fund is financed with payroll
taxes. While currently more than four covered workers support each
beneficiary, that ratio will start slipping early in the next
century. By the middle of the next century there will be just two
covered workers supporting each beneficiary.
   ``Not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the
hospital insurance program inadequate to offset this demographic
change, the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before
the major demographic shift begins to occur,'' said the report,
released Wednesday.

scientists reported today.
   The results, obtained by way of a new embryo-screening procedure
designed to prevent genetic diseases, are the first reported
pregnancies using embryos tested to reveal gender, researchers said

   Two of three pregnant women expect twins this summer, study
co-author Alan Handyside said in a telephone interview. The third

   The laboratory test identified the sex of the microscopic
embryos only three days after fertilization, he said.

   A pornography-fighting Christian group is
blanketing Congress with envelopes it says contain ``filthy''
pictures of homosexual acts from a taxpayer-funded art exhibit.
   Each envelope marked ``extremely offensive material enclosed''
holds explicit photographs and drawings from the ``David
Wojnarowicz, Tongues of Flame'' show mounted with a $15,000 federal
grant.
   The American Family Association hopes a good look at
reproductions of 14 images displayed at the University Galleries at
Illinois State University will convince lawmakers to kill funding
for the National Endowment for the Arts.
   ``We're spending $175 million in this area that benefits
primarily the rich and the perverted,'' the Rev. Donald Wildmon,
founder and director of the Tupelo, Miss.-based association, said
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Plan for Church TV Channel Meets Strong Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL AMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government plan to give the Roman
Catholic Church a television channel has created strong opposition
in a nation where the church worked closely with a half-century
dictatorship overthrown 16 years ago.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's plan would provide the
church not just a platform for religious opinions, but a full
commercial franchise for one of two private channels that are to
end a 26-year state monopoly on television.
   It has provoked heated debate of the church's place in a society
that still retains considerable anti-clerical feeling from the
revolution by leftist military officers on April 25, 1974.
   Conservative businessmen, among the center-right premier's
staunchest supporters, have joined the left against the plan.
   Even the church is not happy. The Catholic Bishop's Conference
also wants control of evening programming on one of the two state
channels and extended air time on weekends.
   The debate has split Cavaco Silva's Social Democratic Party,
which faces elections next year to preserve its parliamentry
majority.
   ``I think it is immoral to grant a channel without a public
tender,'' said Franciso Pinto Balsemao, once a Social Democratic
premier and now a media executive. His company is a leading
contender for one of the private channels.
   Leftists and liberals worry about the political impact of church
television and recall the Roman Catholic hierarchy's close
cooperation with the dictatorial regime founded by Antonio Oliveira
Salazar.
   Salazar granted the church a radio station, Radio Renascenca, in
1936. The station's management is leading the church campaign for a
television channel.
   When Cavaco Silva liberalized radio broadcasting last year, he
restricted private stations to local transmission but left
Renascenca as Portugal's only national station not under state
control.
   ``Renascenca has very strong political views and they interfere
a lot,'' Pinto Balsemao, the former prime minister, told The
Associated Press. ``We cannot say it is an independent project.''
   Since the 1974 revolution, the church has entered politics in
unsuccessful efforts to stop leftist governments from liberalizing
divorce laws and legalizing abortion.
   Church leaders organized a long and emotional campaign against
abortion in the early 1980s, with the support of the Social
Democrats and conservative parties. A parliamentary majority of
Socialists and Communists legalized abortion in 1984.
   Moises Espirito Santo, a sociologist at Lisbon's New University
specializing in religious affairs, said he doubted the church could
enlist as much support for the television channel as it had against
abortion.
   ``The church today has more political power than it had under
Salazar ... but this lacks the emotion of the abortion issue,'' he
said in an interview.
   More than 96 percent of Portuguese are Roman Catholic, but
figures published recently in the newspaper O Jornal indicate only
27 percent attend Mass regularly.
   Strength of religious feeling varies widely. The report said
about 65 percent of people in northern Minho province go to church
regularly, but the number dips below 5 percent in the southern
Alentejo, the rural stronghold of the Communist Party.
   Espirito Santo said much of Portugal's popular religious
feeling, particularly in the countryside, is based on traditional
beliefs and less influenced by teachings of the bishops in the
cities.
   Efforts by clerics to sway votes may have helped thwart
communist ambitions immediately after the revolution, but increased
political awareness after 16 years of democracy means few people
now follow their priest's political guidance, he said.
   ``The church no longer has any electoral weight,'' Espirito
Santo declared. ``Its influence lies in the links the bishops have
with politicians.''
   Some Catholics wonder whether the church will compromise its
moral standards by entering the materialistic world of TV
advertising and competition with the racy Brazilian soap operas
Portuguese viewers enjoy.
   ``What sort of commercial television can they have?'' Pinto
Balsemao asked. ``What sort of advertising can they accept? Are
they going to have `Dallas' and `Dynasty' and the Brazilian
telenovelas (soap operas), which are full of sex and beautiful,
almost-naked girls?''.
   Fernando Magalhaes Crespo, director of Radio Renascenca, said
moral standards would be maintained.
   ``It will be a television with programs parents won't be ashamed
to watch with their children,'' he told Balsemao's weekly newspaper
Expresso.
   Magalhaes Crespo said `Dallas' and `Falcon Crest', Britain's
Benny Hill and many of the Brazilian soaps were not likely to
appear on the Catholic channel.
   Espirito Santo said the argument over telvision is the latest in
a long line of disputes dating to the 19th century, when conflicts
between clerical and secular political groups sometimes became
bloody.
   Roman Catholicism was the state religion until 1910, when an
anticlerical revolution overthrew the monarchy and founded the
republic.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Washington Has Gained Support at United Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. foreign policy is gaining support at
the United Nations and there is less emphasis on linking foreign
aid to how a recipient country votes, the American ambassador says.
   Some Arab envoys, however, expect the Bush administration and
Congress to put pressure on recipients of American aid to rescind a
General Assembly resolution adopted in 1975 that equates Zionism
and racism.
   Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, the U.S. permanent
representative, told reporters recently the idea of linking U.S.
foreign aid to supportive U.N. votes ``never rose to massive
proportions, and the fact is that there is less focus now on
scorecarding in aid than there was before.
   ``I don't think at this stage one can say this is completely a
dead letter, but I don't see it rising to high prominence. ... I
don't believe there is such overwhelming interest in it.
   ``I think we, in fact, should give assistance where we believe
it is in our broad foreign policy interests to do so, all factors
considered.''
   The ambassador said nothing of the Zionism-racism resolution and
Arab statements, made later, that some members of Congress wanted
to penalize nations that did not follow the U.S. line.
   In Decemb is
chairman.
   ``We have a list of who the aid recipients are and how the vote
was, and do they understand their aid is in jeopardy?'' Moynihan
said. ``I mean, enough is enough.
   ``The Soviet Union ... no longer rewards that behavior. Have
they learned it and do they know that this country is angry about
that because they have put peace in jeopardy in a place they had no
business bothering in?
   ``What does it mean to Chile? What does it mean to Sri Lanka?
Whose business is it in the Ivory Coast to cause instability in the
Middle East?''
   Moynihan called the document ``a low point'' in U.N. behavior
and an attempt to politicize the General Assembly.
   Nearly 70 percent of political resolutions received unanimous
support in the 44th General Assembly last year, according to the
latest voting report. That compares with 64 percent in 1988, 60
percent in 1987 and 58 percent in 1986.
   It said other U.N. members voted with the United States 23.3
percent of the time on the 16 issues, which ranged from the
invasion of Panama to the annual question of accepting Israel's
credentials. When all General Assembly votes are examined, the
figure declines to 16.9 percent.
   Some U.N. diplomats say voting the same way does not guarantee
an identical point of view. They also suggest that, if more
countries are voting with the United States, changes in U.S. policy
may be the reason.

   When dawn breaks over the Alleghany
Mountains and shines dimly on Stonewall Jackson Barracks, cadets in
gray and black uniforms march to the mess hall in a cadence
unchanged by the passing of 150 years.
   Tradition is the lifeblood of Virginia Military Institute, a
small public college defending its male-only admissions policy from
a lawsuit by the federal government, what some graduates call the
second War of Northern Aggression.
   The first skirmish in the sex-discrimination lawsuit will be May
4 in U.S. District Court in Roanoke.
   The U.S. Justice Department claims VMI's admissions policy is a
chauvinistic anachronism that is unconstitutional and violates the
Civil Rights Act.
   ``We believe the Justice Department is wrong and we intend to
fight,'' said Maj. Gen. John Knapp, VMI superintendent.
   The vast majority of cadets and alumni believe admitting women
to the corps would ruin the school's mission of producing
citizen-soldiers.
   The academic training and the strict honor code would remain,
they say, but the camaraderie achieved through living in close
quarters and surviving a grueling physical and psychological
freshman year would be changed forever.
   The 1,300 cadets all live in a three-story, fortress-like
dormitory. The Spartan rooms have no telephones, posters,
television sets, curtains or locks on the doors, and the
standardized cots, shelves and desks are made of bare wood.
   The cadets awake to reveille at 6:55 a.m. and head to communal
showers.
   Women, they say, just wouldn't fit in.
   ``How could a cadet bust into the room of a lady at any time and
order her to do push-ups?'' asked Antonio Zang, a cadet from
Fairfax. ``We're taught here to be gentlemen. How can you yell at a
lady and still be a gentleman?''
   The lawsuit was prompted by a letter from a northern Virginia
teen-age girl who complained that she could not attend the school.
   VMI and The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., are the only
state-supported military schools in the nation that refuse to admit
women. The Justice Department is investigating The Citadel for a
possible sex-discrimination case.
   Ironically, Virginia's first female attorney general, Mary Sue
Terry, is defending VMI in the lawsuit, which also names as
defendants Gov. Douglas Wilder, the nation's first black elected
governor, and the state system of higher education.

<TEXT>
   It is a safe bet that on Sunday you're not going
to see a star-studded special called ``Just Say No to Rain
Forests.''
   This is because Sunday is Earth Day. An army of ecology-minded
celebrities will be on TV then, earnestly urging you to save the
planet and to fight pollution, global warming and maybe even bad
breath.
   As you may have noticed, though, Earth Day warmups already are
under way. Today, for example, the scheduled guests on Geraldo
Rivera's syndicated talk show include noted eco-celebs Olivia
Newton-John and John Denver.
   Denver, a spokesman says, will sing his new song, ``Raven's
Child,'' described as ``dedicated to saving the Earth.''
   Tonight at 11:30 p.m. EDT, CBS has ``Save the Planet: A CBS-Hard
Rock Cafe Special,'' in which Katey Sagal, Bobcat Goldthwait and
assorted rock stars gather to joke, sing and ponder the environment.
   An advance tape of that show wasn't available for screening.
Neither was one for ABC's two-hour eco-extravaganza, ``The Earth
Day Special,'' which features more than 40 stars ranging from Jane
Fonda to the Toxic Rappers.
   However, an ABC spokeswoman describes that show, airing Sunday
at 9 p.m. EDT, as an ecological fable. In it, Bette Midler plays an
abused Mother Earth who collapses in a town square during an Earth
Day celebration.
   Midler chastizes Robin Williams, cast as an Everyman, for not
taking better care of her. Then she's whisked to a hospital, where
the staff includes the compassionate Dana Delany of ``China Beach.''
   And so it will go, with song, comedy and vignettes all aimed at
raising the viewers' consciousness about the environment and
showing possible solutions for that which threatens the Earth.
   Cable TV also has a number of Earth Day-related shows afoot,
among them the Discovery Channel's ``Amazonia,'' about the
Brazilian rain forest. That airs tonight, when the baby boomer VH-1
channel also starts a series of programs on environmental issues
that will continue through Sunday.
   The Arts &amp; Entertainment Cable Network will have a one-hour
Sunday special, ``Challenge of the Seas,'' with host-narrator Ted
Danson. The show starts a 26-part weekly documentary series about
the ocean.
   (Danson, of course, is a co-star of ``Cheers.'' It sure would be
nice if some day an oceanographer got to host and narrate that
show.)
   As you'd expect, Ted Turner's cable empire, perhaps the only TV
giant with a vice president for environmental policy, also is
noting Earth Day.
   It has four environmental specials scheduled Sunday, two of them
reruns on his TNT network, and two new shows, a National Geographic
special and a Cousteau Society special, to be shown by his TBS
Superstation.
   And his Cable News Network ``World Report'' on Sunday will
feature an ambitious two-hour collection of reports on
environmental issues in more than 40 countries.
   The news divisions of ABC, NBC and CBS, which have given
extensive coverage to environmental issues this week, will again be
rife with Earth Day reports on Sunday, starting with their morning
programs.
   Local stations will be active, too, although not on as large a
scale as NBC affiliate KRON-TV in San Francisco. It has put
together an Earth Day weekend network of 120 stations to carry two
specials.
   The first is the taped one-hour ``Earth Day 1990: A User's Guide
to Saving the Environment,'' hosted by Dennis Weaver.
   The second, fed live to participating East Coast stations at
11:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, is ``Earth Day Tonight,'' a half-hour wrapup
of Earth Day doings around the nation. That show will be anchored
by Linda Ellerbee.
   Unlike some reporters who may be cynics, she takes a benign view
toward all those Hollywood ecological stars who'll be all over TV
on Sunday.
   ``I suppose it's easy to make fun of the whole notion of the
celebrities who are joining in,'' she says. ``But this is one of
those situations where, I guess, as loud a noise as can be made is
good. ...
   ``The best thing that can be said for them is that by making
such a loud noise, they're helping create a climate where some
things can be done.''

   Dean Kahler hugged the grass of the practice
football field. Bullets were ricocheting off the blacktop road no
more than 40 feet away.
   ``Oh, my God! They're firing,'' he said to himself.
   Then a sudden sting, not much more than a pin prick at his back.
It was the only pain he felt. He would never walk again.
   A bullet fired through Jeffrey Miller's mouth and skull slammed
him to the ground. As his blood pooled along a concrete curb, a
14-year-old runaway knelt over him in anguish, her arms flung
skyward, her face contorted in bewildered terror.
   A 13-second fusillade by National Guardsmen turned anti-war
dissent into disaster on a May Monday 20 years ago at Kent State
University.
   Four students were killed and nine others wounded, stunning a
nation already fragmented by five years of a distant conflict.
   By April 1970, more than 100 young Americans and probably
thousands of Vietnamese, north and south, were dying each week in
distant jungles and rice paddies. But now the war had claimed
victims at home, four kids on a blue-collar campus amid the
pancake-flat farmfields of Ohio.
   (Even so, a Gallup poll taken for Newsweek within days of the
shootings indicated that 58 percent of the public blamed the
demonstrators and backed the Ohio guardsmen. The mourning parents
received hate mail.)
   Almost three more years would pass before the United States
ended its military role in Vietnam, although some families of the
dead believe the Kent State killings hastened that end.
   ``I believe the war in Vietnam was brought to a quicker close
because of it,'' said Florence Schroeder of Lorain, Ohio, whose
19-year-old son, William, died that day. ``That is our only reason
to have ever filed the lawsuits, to make sure the event gets its
proper historical significance.''
   The significance of dead students on American soil was powerful.
Dissent against U.S. involvement in Vietnam had built slowly since
combat troops were sent in March 1965. But by 1970, campuses were
in turmoil over the increasingly unpopular war.
   President Richard Nixon was seen as the villain and he returned
the sentiment in kind. The president assailed the more vocal
anti-war protesters as ``bums.'' His vice president, Spiro Agnew,
suggested in April that universities deal with their protesters
like Nazis: ``The next time a mob of students, waving their
non-negotiable demands, starts pitching bricks and rocks at the
student union _ just imagine they are wearing brown shirts or white
sheets and act accordingly.''
   Adding to the boiling tension was the fact that every young
man's birthday was potentially a ticket to Vietnam. From 1969 to
1973, the military draft was a lottery based on birth dates.
   ``The black cloud of Vietnam and the draft were hanging over
their heads,'' said Kahler, then a 20-year-old freshman and
conscientious objector from Canton, Ohio.
   Thomas Lough was one of many professors who felt they didn't
dare give a male student a failing grade. ``That would kill him,''
said Lough, who teaches sociology at Kent State. ``They'd be
eligible for selective service if they were flunked out of school.
Their lives were on the line.''
   On April 30, student dissenters around the country listened in
disbelief as Nixon announced on nationwide television the invasion
of neutral Cambodia by U.S. troops bent on destroying communist
border sanctuaries.
   Just the previous July, Nixon had begun a phased withdrawal, and
tens of thousands of American men were already back home. Now
Americans were fighting on a new front. Some students had lost
brothers and childhood friends in the war. They didn't want to kill
or to be killed. Protests broke out at one-third of the nation's
2,500 colleges.
   The day after Nixon's speech, perhaps 500 anti-war protesters
rallied peacefully at noon on the Kent State commons, then planned
to gather again Monday.
   But that night, the first warm evening of the year, a small
crowd of students and townies spilled from a string of bars in
downtown Kent. Early festiveness turned to angry shouts and
anti-war slogans. A passing police cruiser dodged beer bottles.
   The crowd, by midnight swollen to 500 people, lit a bonfire in
the street and began smashing shop windows.
   The mayor declared a civil emergency, imposed a curfew, closed
the bars and summoned the National Guard. Thrown rocks slightly
injured four or five officers. Police forced the students back onto
campus with tear gas.
   The violence continued. On Saturday night, the campus ROTC
building was burned down. Demonstrators threw rocks at firefighters
and slashed their hoses. The arsonists were never identified or
arrested.
   The National Guard arrived in the midst of the chaos. One convoy
was stoned as it approached the campus. The guardsmen were already
weary, pulled away from patrolling interstate highways during a
truckers' strike.
   When they were called out again to patrol Monday morning,
``nobody had any sleep to amount to anything,'' recalled Sgt. Leon
Smith of Beach City, Ohio.
   That same morning, Alan Canfora, a 21-year-old junior from
Barberton, Ohio, left for the noon rally carrying a black flag, his
banner of mourning for yet another Vietnam casualty.
   Even before the Cambodia invasion, more Americans were dying
every day. The toll was grim: 335 killed in January, 385 in
February, 442 in March. One of the April victims was Canfora's
childhood friend.
   Canfora, upset at his friend's death and by the presence of the
guardsmen on campus, joined 200 to 300 student protesters gathered
at the commons. As other students left class for lunch, the crowd
grew to as many as 2,000, many of them on the hill behind the main
knot of demonstrators.
   Many of the dissenters talked angrily about the guardsmen, the
curfew and the university's ban on rallies, announced the day
before. They considered the last an attack on their rights to free
speech and assembly.
   ``I felt so strongly against the war,'' Canfora said in an
interview. ``I was willing to risk my own life and face those
rifles. I chose the black flag because of the sad state of affairs
on our campus and in our country.''
   To enforce the ban on rallies, guardsmen drove past in a jeep,
ordering students through a bullhorn to leave the commons.
   ``Pigs off campus!'' the students shouted.
   ``Sieg Heil!'' they chanted, mocking the Nazi salute.
   Students hurled stones at the jeep, and guardsmen retaliated
with a burst of tear gas canisters. The students tossed them back.
   Within moments, however, the nearly 100 guardsmen had fixed
their bayonets and loaded their weapons, mostly M-1 rifles. They
advanced on the students, scattering them in retreat over the hill
and down the other side onto the football field and parking lot.

   As the students retreated, Allison Krause, a freshman honors
student from Pittsburgh who had just turned 19, turned to her
boyfriend and sobbed, ``Why are they doing this to us? Why don't
they let us be?'' She cursed the soldiers and threw rocks.
   The guardsmen regrouped on the practice field, knelt and aimed
their rifles at students in the parking lot. But other students had
regrouped behind them. Realizing they were outflanked, the
guardsmen rose and marched back up the hill to resume their
original position on the commons.
   They were under bombardment from stones and obscenities, but the
nearest students were at least 60 feet away. As the guardsmen
neared the top of the hill, they suddenly turned, rifles at their
shoulders.
   The gunfire stunned the students. Many began running. Others
dropped to the ground. Some, thinking the guardsmen were firing
blanks, stood their ground _ until they heard the bullets hitting
around them.
   Joseph Lewis Jr., an 18-year-old freshman from Massillon, Ohio,
and probably closest to the guardsmen, was shot as he made an
obscene gesture. A guardsman later said he believed Lewis was
advancing on him. Lewis was hit just below the waist and slammed to
the ground.
   ``I felt like being hit in the stomach with a shovel,'' he said.
``I thought I was dying. I prayed.'' Another bullet hit his left
leg.
   Canfora, about 75 yards away, was shot in the right wrist. ``I
got behind a tree. That's what saved my life,'' he said. ``I'm
convinced they were shooting at me intentionally. I could hear
bullets hitting the tree. I could hear bullets zipping and cracking
through the air and through the grass on both sides of the tree.''
   Sixty-one shots were fired from at least 28 weapons.
   Allison Krause fell mortally wounded 100 yards away from the
guardsmen, a bullet through her chest. The body of 20-year-old Jeff
Miller of Plainview, N.Y., dropped 90 yards from the rifles.
   The FBI said Krause and Miller were initially at the front of
the crowd taunting the guardsmen. Miller made some offensive
gestures and Miss Krause shouted obscenities, the report said, but
``neither was in a position to pose even a remote danger to the
National Guard at the time of the firing.''
   Sandy Scheuer, 20, of Boardman, Ohio, and Schroeder were walking
to class. Each was about 130 yards from the guardsmen. Schroeder
was shot in the back after diving to the ground. Scheuer was shot
through the neck.
   ``I was scared,'' said Sgt. Smith, who fired one shot into the
air. ``I felt my life was in danger. I had a fellow coming at me
with what looked like a brick in his hand. I had no intention of
hurting anybody or killing anybody.''
   What prompted the shootings remains a mystery. The FBI said it
could only speculate. One theory is that a guardsman either fired
in panic or shot intentionally at a student, and the other
guardsmen fired at the sound of the first shot.
   The President's Commission on Campus Unrest said that although
the actions of some students were violent, criminal, dangerous,
reckless and irresponsible, ``the indiscriminate firing of rifles
into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were
unnecessary, unwarranted and inexcusable.''
   A Portage County special grand jury found that the guardsmen
acted in self-defense and exonerated them of criminal charges. It
indicted 25 students and faculty members including Canfora, Lewis
and Lough, the professor. Those charges were dropped in December
1971.
   In March 1974, a federal grand jury in Cleveland indicted eight
guardsmen on charges of violating the civil rights of the dead and
wounded students. Midway through the trial, a judge dropped all
charges for lack of evidence.
   The wounded students and the families of the dead settled a $40
million civil suit out of court in January 1979 for $675,000. But
more important to them, they said, was a signed acknowledgment by
the defendants, Gov. James A. Rhodes and 27 guardsmen, that the
shootings should not have occurred and that the confrontation could
have been resolved in other ways.
   After years of debate over an appropriate memorial, a granite
plaza with four prominent upright slabs is being dedicated May 4 on
a 2{-acre site adjacent to the parking lot where the students were
killed.
   A bouquet of 58,175 gold daffodils already blooms around the
memorial, one for each American man and woman killed in Vietnam.
   For Florence Schroeder, the daffodils are a living memorial more
valuable than quarried granite. Her son, she explains, used to pick
her wild flowers when he was a schoolboy. She says she will plant
one more daffodil at the memorial.
   For him.

   June Romeo is back at Kent State, a generation
after witnessing National Guard bullets kill four students and
wound nine more. The tears still come easily.
   ``It's funny,'' the 38-year-old nursing instructor and graduate
student said. ``They said 13 seconds (of gunfire). When you stop to
think: one, two, three, four ... If you count, that's a long time.''
   Romeo, then an 18-year-old freshman from Westlake, Ohio, was
about 20 steps from one of the wounded, Tom Grace. ``You don't
believe it at first,'' she said. ``No one had ever shot a student
protester before.''
   The violence and its emotion-charged aftermath became too much
for Romeo. She left campus the next year, upset by such scenes as a
cafeteria confrontation between students joking about the shootings
and others who were irate.
   ``It was not the right place for me,'' said Romeo, who tried
selling insurance then enrolled at Baldwin-Wallace College, a small
liberal arts school in Berea, near her hometown.
   ``I kept thinking, `I should go back,' but I never did,'' said
Romeo, who keeps a candle from the first campus anniversary
memorial May 4, 1971. Twenty years later, she has come back, as a
graduate student and instructor in educational theory.
   ``The tragedy was very personal,'' said Romeo, whose
undergraduate students occasionally note her resemblance to the
young woman whose searing photographic image, arms raised high over
a dying Kent State student, won a Pulitzer Prize.
   Romeo said she pushed the shootings out of her mind, along with
other campus memories. She lost track of classmates and roommates.
She collected _ but never read _ almost every book about the
shootings and student unrest in 1970.
   ``I wanted things connected with it,'' she said of the books.
Her husband has read the books, but the two don't talk about ``May
4.''
   Romeo says the only person with whom she discussed Kent State in
detail was a physician and former Navy officer who convinced her
that the guardsmen would never have fired without a command.
   ``That more than anything else has bothered me. ... I can't
conceive of a mind that would give an order like that,'' she said,
pausing to catch her breath at the thought.
   Romeo's emotions were rekindled four years ago when James
Rhodes, who as Ohio governor had ordered the National Guard onto
the Kent State campus to restore order, was a patient at the
Cleveland Clinic, where Romeo was a nurse.
   The soft-spoken Romeo said her loathing for Rhodes and his role
in what happened was so strong that she took a day or two off while
Rhodes was hospitalized.
   ``I kept thinking, `I want so much for him to feel some of the
terror those people felt,''' she said. ``That really brought it
back. I never had feelings like that about anyone. I really can't
think of people I hate.''
   Romeo returned to Kent State full-time last year. She credits
her social activism for her return to campus and her efforts to
deal with memories of the shootings. She runs a program in
Cleveland's inner city that teaches youngsters to read and write as
well as how to make reasoned decisions that will affect their lives.
   ``I need to help people become aware,'' she said. ``Aware of
choices and consequences.''
   Romeo believes that few among the couple thousand Kent State
students protesting the war on May 4, 1970 were aware of the
potential consequences. She teaches her students that ``you're
going to have to decide for yourselves what battles are important
to fight and what aren't worth your time and effort.''
   When her students learn she was a student of the '70s, they are
curious about the period. She tells them she favored ``weird
clothes'' and wore her hair long and flowing.
   ``I even wore flowers in my hair,'' she tells them. ``They said,
`Noooo.'''
   Romeo brushes aside the current campus brouhaha over whether the
granite memorial to be dedicated on the 20th anniversary of the
shootings is too little, too late.
   ``I don't care that much about the memorial,'' she said. ``I
think the most fitting thing is to keep the whole thing alive.
People 20 years down the line should really be questioning it. It
should be studied _ like we study wars.''

   Twenty years later, the survivors, mostly
poor peasants, still remember the terror of the American warplanes
and the many who could not evade their fury.
   Hok Nhem says the planes killed four of her 10 children and
destroyed her fine concrete house. Two youngsters died at play in a
village street. Two older children were felled by strafing jets in
the rice paddies.
   ``To this very day I don't know why the Americans bombed our
village,'' said Choi Sandal. She recalls the afternoon when six
jets swooped down and she sprinted home from the fields to try to
save her grandparents but was held back by flames shooting as high
as the coconut trees.
   For five years, in a brutal aerial bombardment kept secret from
the American public, U.S. planes, often B-52 bombers, savaged the
countryside around this remote town and other border areas of
eastern Cambodia.
   In the spring of 1970, American soldiers came on foot. President
Richard Nixon ordered the invasion to finally destroy border
sanctuaries used by Vietnamese communists.
   ``To protect our men who are in Vietnam and to guarantee the
continued success of our withdrawal and Vietnamization program, I
have concluded that the time has come for action,'' Nixon announced
on television April 30, 1970. A day earlier, American and South
Vietnamese troops had begun Operation Total Victory.
   The invasion prompted anti-war demonstrations across the United
States; at Kent State University in Ohio, four students were shot
dead by National Guardsmen.
   In Cambodia, some historians say, the invasion was the catalyst
for a chain reaction of national tragedies. Villagers here don't
make such subtle linkages; they do say that since that time they
have known only suffering.
   ``The pattern of Vietnam is being repeated,'' said an Associated
Press dispatch from the front. ``The American troops are putting
the torch to homes because they may be useful to the communists.
Livestock is shot for the same reason.''
   Some of the worst damage was inflicted on Snuol and Mimot.
Described by the Americans as an enemy hub, Snuol was all but
razed. When troops entered the once picturesque town they found the
charred bodies of one girl, one woman and two men.
   Mimot was partly destroyed by air strikes after North Vietnamese
in the town fired on U.S. helicopters. ``It is pretty well blown
away,'' reported one American officer.
   Today, ox carts roll down the town's red dirt main street, past
buildings still scarred by shrapnel. Long strips of two-story
shop-houses were rebuilt only in the last several years, said
Deputy District Chief Rin Saman.
   Rin Saman, who was in Mimot during the invasion, said the bombed
sugar factory where he worked remains inoperative and much of the
vast rubber plantation on the edge of town still lies in ruins.
Only traces remain of what was a hospital for plantation workers.
   By the end of June 1970, the invasion force of 63,000, including
23,000 Americans, had returned to South Vietnam. According to the
U.S. command, 339 Americans, 799 South Vietnamese and more than
11,000 communist soldiers were killed and vast amounts of communist
supplies destroyed in the operation.
   But Cambodia would never heal. The invasion had created a new
battle front, dragged all of Cambodia into the Indochinese
conflict, and started years of national agony.
   The capital city of Phnom Penh, as well as the U.S.-backed
government of Lon Nol, fell to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas April 17,
1975, two weeks before the fall of Saigon. What followed was the
ghastly ultra-revolution of the victors.
   Mimot's inhabitants were driven into rural communes or forced
into slave labor on the rubber plantation. Press Samoeur, deputy
governor of Kompong Cham province, which surrounds Mimot, estimates
360,000 inhabitants of the province perished under the 1975-78 rule
of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. Some say craters from the B-52
bombings were used for mass graves.
   Nationwide estimates of deaths by execution, starvation and
disease in the ``killing fields'' of Pol Pot range as high as 3
million, in a country that had 7.3 million inhabitants in 1975.
   ``It was harder to survive under Pol Pot than under American
bombs,'' said Rin Saman.
   In 1978, the area was invaded again, this time by the Vietnamese
who punched across the border on Christmas Day to oust the Khmer
Rouge. Today the Khmer Rouge are one-third of an anti-government
coalition supported by the United States.
   ``U.S. aggressors bombed schools, roads, bridges, hospitals,
markets. They razed people's homes. They sprayed chemicals on the
rubber plantations,'' Press Samoeur said in an interview. ``And
until this day the U.S. government still has a distorted view of
what is happening in Cambodia.''
   Choi Sandal, now 38, is still haunted by the sight of her
grandparents' charred remains in the still-smoldering village,
where only one of 60 houses survived the aerial attack.
   The aging widow Hok Nhem posed for a photo before a house built
on the ruins of the concrete one. Only one pillar remains of the
old, atop which she has placed an aviary for doves.
   Other survivors joined them, talking openly with this reporter,
the first American most had met in 20 years. A toothless old man
was overheard suggesting the reporter might be there to assess
damage for future U.S. reparations.
   But nobody openly mentioned this nor exhibited the slightest
hostility. Instead, they clasped their hands together in the
traditional prayer-like gesture of farewell _ and offered a glass
of sweet coconut milk.

   Every spring, just as surely as the
daffodils, sad memories bloom again.
   In the spring of 1970, in his last letter home from college,
William Schroeder altered a few lines from a popular Neil Young
song, ``I Am a Child,'' to tell his mother he loved her and savored
weekends spent at home.
   ``I am a child, I last awhile,
   ``You can't perceive all the pleasure in my smile.
   ``You make the rules, you say what's fair,
   ``It's lots of fun to have you there ... ''
   Twenty springs have come and gone since May 4, 1970, when
William Schroeder and three other students were gunned down by
National Guardsmen at anti-war demonstrations on the Kent State
University campus.
   But the annual arrival of spring cannot erase the pain felt for
missing sons and daughters, for friends lost forever, for
graduations unattended and anniversaries uncelebrated.
   ``Even after 20 years it still hurts,'' said Florence Schroeder,
who lives in Lorain. ``They took him away, but they can't wipe out
the memory.''
   Schroeder's mother can still recite, her voice breaking, the
words from the Neil Young song. But sometimes the memories are too
painful for her and her husband, Louis.
   ``At the end of the trials,'' she said, ``we promised ourselves
we'd never go that far down deep into our souls again. It hurts too
much.''
   Schroeder, 19, was shot in the back while lying on the ground.
He took cover when the gunfire began as he walked to class after a
meeting with his ROTC adviser.
   He was concerned that the military program paying his
scholarship might be discontinued because demonstrators had burned
down the ROTC building two days earlier. The Vietnam war tormented
Schroeder, his mother said, because he knew he would end up there.
   ``Flowers and Bullets'' is the name of an album of remembrances
put together for Allison Krause's parents by her college boyfriend.
On her tombstone is the epitaph, ``Flowers are better than bullets,
May 3, 1970.''
   May 3, a Sunday, provided a sunny, peaceful respite from campus
rumblings. As Allison, a freshman honors student from Pittsburgh
who had just turned 19, and her boyfriend strolled the campus, they
encountered a soldier with a lilac in his gun barrel.
   When his commanding officer ridiculed him and pulled the lilac
from the rifle, Allison grabbed it before he could toss it down. As
the officer walked away, Allison yelled after him.
   ``What's the matter with peace? Flowers are better than
bullets.''
   Her father, Arthur Krause, spent a decade seeking the justice he
and the other ``Kent Families,'' as they came to call themselves,
felt was due them.
   In the final court settlement of a $40 million civil suit in
January 1979, the four families and nine wounded students received
$675,000 to be divided among them. But more important to them, they
said, was a signed statement of regret and acknowledgment from Ohio
Gov. James A. Rhodes and 27 guardsmen that the shootings should not
have occurred.
   Arthur Krause died of cancer in 1988. His widow, Doris, feels
only rancor toward Kent State. She says she will never return under
any official invitation, not even for dedication of a memorial that
will mark the 20th anniversary of her daughter's slaying.
   ``I'll be bitter to the day I die,'' Mrs. Krause said. She
recalls with anger how she learned of Allison's death only by
calling the hospital after a reporter told her Allison had been
wounded.
   ``Would you not expect to hear something from that university?''
she asked. ``Would you not expect to see an official at the
hospital where you went to see your dead child to extend a hand, to
tell you what happened?
   ``They've never done that. Their letter of sympathy was a check,
a refund made out to Allison for spring tuition. She wasn't around
to cash it.''
   Jeff Miller left behind an anti-war poem he wrote when he was 16.
   `` ... A teen-ager from a small Ohio farm clutches his side in
pain,
   ``and as he feels his life ebbing away, he too asks why _
   ``why is he dying here, thousands of miles from home ...
   `` ... The War Without a Purpose marches on relentlessly,
   ``not stopping to mourn for its dead,
   ``content to wait for its end.
   ``But all the frightened parents who still have their sons
   ``fear that the end is not in sight.''
   Four years later, he lay dying in a pool of blood, a bullet
through his skull. It was his body that a 14-year-old runaway, Mary
Ann Vecchio, knelt over in the famous photograph, her arms
outstretched in anguish, her face filled with terror.
   His mother, Elaine Holstein of New York City, is still shaken by
his poem.
   ``It's always struck me as strange and ironic that he refers to
a teen-ager from a small Ohio farm,'' she said, ``never knowing
that he himself would die four years later in a small Ohio farm
town.''
   Among the mementos Sarah and Martin Scheuer of Boardman, Ohio,
have kept for 20 years is an anniversary card from their younger
daughter, 20-year-old Sandra.
   Her note had urged them to dine at a Chinese restaurant and
enjoy their 27th wedding anniversary that May 4: ``Honorable wish
for happy anniversary to honorable couple who still have big yen
for each other.''
   But celebration turned to mourning. The card arrived the same
day Sandy lay dead in a parking lot, felled by a bullet through her
neck as she walked to a speech therapy class.
   ``How would you like to identify your child in a morgue?'' Mrs.
Scheuer asked 20 years later.

   Dean Kahler has only to look down to remember that day. A rifle
bullet made him a paraplegic and put him in a wheelchair for life.
   ``I know why I'm sitting in it,'' Kahler said. ``I'll never
really forget Kent State.''
   Kahler, then a 20-year-old freshman from Canton, Ohio, had
worked nearly a year in a steel mill to help pay for school. When
rifle fire crackled over the shouts of his fellow students, he fell
to the ground to take cover. He felt a sensation like a bee sting;
it was a bullet ripping into his spinal cord.
   Kahler, a conscientious objector, was the most seriously injured
of the nine persons wounded. He finished school seven years later
then built a career in state government, working for the secretary
of state and attorney general. He was elected an Athens County
commissioner in 1984 and re-elected four years later.
   Kahler, divorced in 1984, married a counselor he met in a pub
last August. He frequently drives the 340-mile round trip to Kent
State for sports and alumni events. He is a guest lecturer for a
regularly offered course that examines the Kent State shootings and
their aftermath.
   ``Kent State is not something I carry around as a burden,'' he
said. ``Just because I had one bad day at Kent doesn't mean the
whole university should be condemned. ... To me what's more
important is the county budget ... and my family and the rest of my
life.''
   But for Sarah and Martin Scheuer, much of their life died in a
13-second volley of gunfire.
   ``It ruined our lives,'' said Scheuer, now 79 and suffering from
Parkinson's disease.
   As the seasons come and go, so do May 4 wedding anniversaries _
unmarked, uncelebrated. Nor can Mrs. Scheuer bear the fragrance of
springtime lilacs.
   ``I'd like to bring them all inside. I love them all so much,''
Sandy told her mother when Mrs. Scheuer visited her apartment two
days before she died. Those were the last words her mother ever
heard her speak.
   ``I try not to look at them,'' said Mrs. Scheuer. ``It just
makes me feel sad.''

<HEAD>Investigation of Jesuit Killings Proceeds; Others Do Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani's
government has brought charges against soldiers in the massacre of
six Jesuit priests, but investigations of other alleged military
atrocities seem to go nowhere.
   ``Unless the killings cause an uproar abroad, nothing gets
done,'' said a judge who, for a time, was dealing with the case of
seven young men slain Nov. 18. A witness said they were lined up
against a wall and shot by soldiers.
   No witness or complainant came forward by the end of November
and the judge referred the case to the next higher justice.
   ``Coming forward to testify would be a real risk,'' the judge
said. ``The case will be `under investigation' until it is
forgotten.''
   The young men were killed in the poor Cuscatancingo neighborhood
of San Salvador two days after troopers of the elite, U.S.-trained
Atlacatl battalion massacred six Jesuit priests who taught at
Central American University, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   Those killings shocked the world. The United States, which gives
El Salvador more than $1 million a day in aid, put pressure on the
Cristiani administration to identify and punish the people
responsible.
   A colonel and three lieutenants have been charged, but critics
say others were involved.
   Such charges are an exception in a country where members of the
armed forces or military-backed death squads are believed to have
murdered thousands of people they suspect of being leftists.
   Despite a wealth of evidence, no officer has been convicted of a
crime involving politically motivated abuse of human rights in El
Salvador.
   No officer had even been charged until March 1989, when a major
was indicted for killings. He has not been tried.
   The attention given the Jesuit case is exceptional. The
treatment of the Cuscatancingo case has become the norm in a decade
of civil war.
   ``As long as our military men do not understand the meaning of
the administration of justice and that they, too, are subject to
(it), we will have no justice and no improvement in respect for
human rights,'' said Maria Julia Hernandez, director of the Roman
Catholic Church legal aid office.
   The Cuscatancingo killings were barely noticed during an
offensive by leftist guerrillas that convulsed San Salvador and
three other cities for two weeks.
   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado, who has dealt with dozens of
foreign officials checking on the Jesuit investigation, said he had
not even heard of the case.
   ``There were a hundred cases like that,'' of bodies found in the
street, Colorado said when told of it. He suggested the victims
were guerrillas or were killed in a cross fire.
   The seven bodies were found sprawled at the foot of a
bloodstained wall, the only wall on the street pocked by bullets.
Two victims still clutched social security cards in their hands in
what the witness described as an effort to identify themselves as
workmen.
   Colorado acknowledged that U.S. pressure has spurred some
investigations, and said: ``Justice should work for everybody, not
just for the Americans.''
   In Cuscatancingo, two young men said they fled the scene as
soldiers ordered the others into the street.
   One spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. He
expressed fear that soldiers would kill him if he accused them
openly.
   He and the others were sitting along a sidewalk Nov. 18 when an
army patrol spotted them and ordered them into the main road, the
young man said.
   Most of them reached for identity cards and obeyed the order,
but the young man said he told his brother and a friend, all out of
sight at the end of the line, that the three should run.
   His brother said he had nothing to worry about and went with the
group, the young man said, but he and the friend ran up a side
street.
   Five minutes later, they heard a volley of shots followed by
single shots, ``coups de grace,'' and his brother and the others
were dead, he told the AP.
   Family members reported the killings to a justice of the peace,
who inspected the scene.
   The judge who first dealt with the case said only a formal
complaint from the young man could activate an investigation, and
``I can only offer him security up to a certain point.''
   He also said coming forward probably would not make much
difference.
   ``We judges supposedly are the authority, and the police
supposedly are the auxiliary organs, but the reality is very
different,'' he said, on condition of anonymity.
   ``I would have to depend on the police, which are part of the
armed forces, to investigate the armed forces. You see where that
puts us.''
   Proceso, the weekly publication of Central American University,
published an article in February on the Cuscatancingo slayings.
   ``Three months after the two massacres, those materially
responsible for the murder of the Jesuits have been arrested and
charged,'' it said. ``The murderers of the seven young men in
Cuscatancingo, on the other hand, remain unpunished.
   ``The contrast between the two cases is a example of how little
the country's judicial system has been consolidated,
notwithstanding the trumpeted advances the government has
proclaimed with regard to the Jesuit case.''

<HEAD>A Kinder, Gentler Commune After Guru's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POONA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buffeted by the recent death of its god and
a drop in donations, the commune of the late free-love guru Osho
Rajneesh is trying to save itself by going mainstream.
   Emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises.
Primal screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the
noise. Deals have been signed with prominent companies for
distribution of video cassettes.
   ``We are mellowing,'' said Swami Tatahgat, an Indian board
member of Rajneesh Foundation, the trust that controls the commune.
``Before, we used to wear our rebelliousness on our sleeves.''
   It appears to be a kinder, gentler commune at Poona, a far cry
from the days in Rajneeshpuram, Ore., when commune members poisoned
each other for being ``negative.'' In those days, Rajneesh called
himself Bhagwan, or God.
   No longer do disciples prance half-naked through the halls of
the local five-star hotel, the Blue Diamond. The hotel recently
welcomed them back, but only for meals.
   The lush 11-acre campus, with its miniature waterfalls, outdoor
Japanese restaurant and high-tech workout rooms, seems more like a
summer camp for adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in
consciousness.
   All visitors are required to produce the results of an AIDS test
no more than a month old. Westerners seen groping at one another's
bodies on Poona's streets may get a talking to by other followers.
   Osho mediatation is taught at the Tata Management School, a
Poona business college. The commune has a contract with CBS@India
to distribute videotapes of Rajneesh's lectures, and another with
Pocket Books to publish his writings.

   Day breaks at the Osho International Commune.
   Disciples gather for a meditation session in Lao Tzu Hall, where
the guru's ashes are housed in a small vault kept on his marble bed.
   Pattering into the house, they pass through a marble room
furnished only with a plush dental chair.
   ``This is where Osho had his teeth fixed,'' Swami Subhuti, a
commune spokesman, intones reverently. He used to be Peter Waight,
a newspaper reporter in London.
   Inside the mausoleum, once Rajneesh's bedroom, disciples move
close to the vault containing his ashes. ``Never born, never
died,'' reads the epitaph on black marble.
   A stocky guard flicks a remote-control switch. Lights in an
ornate glass chandelier dim. A chime rings and meditating begins.

   Osho Rajneesh, the mesmerizing guru of quick-fix enlightenment,
died Jan. 19. At the height of his popularity, the 58-year-old
former teacher of Sanskrit amassed 500,000 followers, 87 Rolls
Royces, diamond-studded watches and gowns fashioned from gold
thread.
   Rajneesh started his movement in India in the late 1960s,
preaching a blend of Eastern mysticism, free love and pop
psychology. Among his 650 works are such titles as ``Take It Easy''
(Vols. I and II) and ``Ya-Hoo.''
   He changed his name numerous times, adopting Bhagwan, Zorba the
Buddha and finally, Osho, ``the one the heavens shower with
flowers.''
   In the early 1980s, Rajneesh moved his band of red-robed
followers to a 64,229-acre ranch in the hills of central Oregon.
   Rancho Rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the
United States in 1985 for immigration fraud, and the American
movement degenerated into a miasma of poisonings and costly court
cases.
   Ma Anand Sheela, Rajneesh's former chief aide, was sentenced to
4{ years in prison for arson, attempted murder and masterminding a
food-poisoning outbreak that made 750 people sick. Other aides
avoided prosecution by cooperating with police.
   Rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through
meditation, as he defined it.
   Through meditation, he said, his followers could destroy the
family, the church and the state, structures he said were
destroying humanity.
   He developed or synthesized several techniques, including one in
which followers jump up and down, yelling ``Hoo, hoo, hoo!''
   Unlike gurus who demanded that disciples reject worldly goods,
Rajneesh encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures,
including sex, drugs and good food.
   ``Only by this way will you ever rise above them,'' he said in
one of his famous discourses, which he peppered with bathroom humor
and intriguing riddles.
   Those who succeeded in meditation, the guru said, would attain
``Buddhahood,'' or enlightenment; they would be able to live in the
world unaffected by its changes.
   ``What Osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not
changing the shape of your nose or face, but changing the shape of
your inner space,'' said Swami Amrito, a British doctor who was
with Rajneesh when he died.
   Rajneesh returned to India in 1986 and problems followed the
movement home.
   After his death, the Indian press speculated that Rajneesh was
murdered or died of AIDS. His followers denied the claims and
accused the United States of poisoning their god while he was in
jail.
   Indian newspapers claimed Westerners were trying to seize
control of the movement. The commune also rejected that claim.
   A mysterious team of 21 people, called the ``Inner Circle,''
runs the commune. An American, Swami Jayesh, and the British
doctor, Swami Amrito, are believed to be in charge.
   Negative publicity has hurt donations, which routinely reached
millions of dollars a year.
   Swami Tatahgat, the Indian board member, said the commune did
not plan to expand its campus because ``we don't have the funds.''
Last year, the commune lost a court case and was forced to pay the
Indian government $2 million in back taxes.

   ``Be there or be square,'' says a Californian with pigs riding
surfboards on his shorts.
   The meeting of the White Robed Brotherhood is the centerpiece of
meditation at the commune. Every evening, hundreds of followers don
cotton robes and gather in the Gautama the Buddha Auditorium.
   Disciples pass a metal detector, then a duo of sniffing women
whose job it is to detect those who are wearing perfume or haven't
bathed.
   ``Osho doesn't like weird smells,'' says one olfactory guard.
Like other followers, she speaks of Rajneesh in the present tense.
   His empty chair sits on a marble stage between two air
conditioners set at 52 degrees Fahrenheit, his preferred
temperature.
   A screen drops and a video of the master is shown.
   As the discourse ends, a young Frenchwoman whispers: ``He is
still with us.''

   _ Leading two barracks rebellions
against the last government cost Aldo Rico his army career, so the
cashiered colonel has taken his charisma into politics.
   Rico, 47, says he wants to mobilize Argentines disenchanted with
the policies of President Carlos Menem, who took office last year.
   He attracted about 1,000 people to a recent rally in a dingy
gymnasium. Hundreds of voices shouted ``Viva!'' when he raised a
clenched fist at the end and cried ``Viva la Patria!'' (Long live
the Fatherland.)
   ``It was thrilling,'' he said a few minutes later. ``That's only
the second time I've spoken in front of a large crowd.''
   The former colonel has been a factor in politics since April
1987, when he led a mthuania-Norway, Lithuania seeks help from
oil-exporting Norway to survive a Soviet energy embargo.

   Fame came early for Drs. James Cimino and
Michael Brescia. But they ditched life in the limelight for the
quieter rewards of treating patients dying of cancer.
   They insist, repeatedly, that they're no heroes. ``We aren't
saintly,'' said Cimino. ``Whatever people do, they do with the
motivation of self-gratification.''
   They praise co-workers at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx and
speak with awe of the nuns who founded the hospital.
   ``We took a road,'' says Brescia. ``To the left, it looked shiny
and gold. But to the right, it looked happier to us.''
   They came to the crossroads 25 years ago, when as internists at
the Veterans Administration hospital in the Bronx, they developed a
procedure now widely used in kidney dialysis.
   Medical journals touted their achievement. Research
opportunities rolled in. They were invited to speak at conventions.
They were offered an entire Westchester County hospital, for a
token $1, if they would turn it into a kidney center.
   Instead, they chose the day-to-day rewards at Calvary, the
nation's only acute care hospital devoted exclusively to advanced
cancer patients.
   ``We didn't go home if someone was suffering,'' said Brescia.
``We learned to live with tiny victories: The patient was able to
eat today, or go to church, or sit in a chair, or play with her
children. We're mature enough to accept that.''
   Without that attitude, he conceded, a patient could ``put
tremendous anxiety in you by looking at you and expecting what
cannot be done: those pleading eyes, looking at you, telling you
that you've failed.''
   In 1961, Cimino, director of renal services at the VA hospital,
began spending a few hours a week as an adviser at Calvary. Then
Brescia, one of his residents, joined him. Gradually, it became
their life's work.
   ``We felt this was a mission,'' said Brescia, who, like Cimino,
is a father of six. ``We saw unbearable suffering of patients and
families that we, as physicians, could relieve.''
   ``It was an adventure,'' said Brescia. ``But I wasn't unhappy
taking it. To me, it looked good and right.''
   Cimino became medical director and Brescia his assistant. Under
their leadership, Calvary won accreditation.
   The two capitalized on their fame to lure other doctors to
Calvary. In 1980, they dropped their titles to become assistants to
the medical director and senior attending physicians; mostly, they
were ``just doctors,'' and the patients think that's just fine.
   ``I came from another hospital,'' said Vivian Dowling. ``This is
heaven in comparison _ and I'm not just saying that because the
doctor is here.''
   ``I love Vivian; she's brave and courageous,'' said Brescia.
``When you work with patients like this, the things you thought
were important _ you get home and somebody went through the garage
door _ don't mean anything.''
   Calvary, unlike a hospice, is a full-fledged hospital. It uses
medical treatments to slow the spread of cancer, fight other
ailments brought on by the disease, and alleviate pain. But the
emphasis is on comfort, rather than cures.
   Miss Dowling, for instance, ``came here in terrible pain: not
from the cancer, but from a hole in her back,'' said Brescia, 57.
``I cured the hole. Now, she's a whole person.''
   Cimino and Brescia maintain that, even in an era of hospices and
patient rights, the terminally ill often are shunted to the back
wards of big hospitals and ignored by busy doctors.
   ``Some oncologists are not able to work here. They want to see
the patients get well,'' said Cimino, 60. ``A place like this could
be very defeating for persons with that attitude. That's why so
many of these kind of places are led by religious groups.''
   ``One of the worst things in this stage of life is to feel that
you're not worthy of the attention of a professional,'' Cimino
added.
   It's not uncommon for doctors at Calvary to telephone a patient
on a holiday. New patients are presented with a rose. There is a
free beauty parlor and barber. ``Even the security guards are told
to be gentle. Everything is done with human dignity,'' said Brescia.
   ``It's equally important for the doctors to comfort the
families,'' he said. ``The families have been through hell: They're
devastated. Sometimes we sit them down with a cup of coffee. We're
trying to undo all the spiritual and emotional neglect.''
   Many patients, some of them lying on colorful gurneys, also
attend Catholic, Protestant or Jewish services in the chapel or
watch them on closed-circuit television in their rooms.
   The staff relies heavily on ``cancer care technicians,'' who
work under the supervision of registered nurses to change
tracheotomy tubes and surgical dressings, groom patients and ``give
the most essential quality of care: kindness and love,'' said
Cimino.
   ``It's the philosophy of non-abandonment. You keep your promises
to the patients; you never let them feel isolated,'' he said.
   And along with the attention, said Brescia, ``We always leave a
tiny bit of hope in the patient.''

<HEAD>Scientists Coax Bamboo to Flower for First Time in Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POONA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a fall day in 1988, botanist Rajani
Nadgauda burst into her boss's office and shouted: ``The bamboo is
flowering.''
   The scientist led her boss by the hand to the greenhouse where,
in a beaker, a bamboo seedling had sprouted tiny pale flowers.
   Like all bamboo buds, they weren't very pretty. Limp, almost dry
and close to colorless, the flowers exuded no fragrance. But to
Mrs. Nadgauda and her boss, plant physiologist Anthony Mascarenhas,
they were beautiful.
   Thus began a ground-breaking experiment on the ``high emperor of
all the grasses.'' For almost two years, the ``bamboo team'' at
India's National Chemical Laboratory used rigorous science, the
potion-making of a brewmaster, and a good dose of superstition to
coax successive groups of bamboo to flower. The results were
published March 22 in the British magazine Nature.
   The implications of coaxing a bamboo to flower in a laboratory
are immense. Bamboo is an important raw material for paper and in
construction. Its shoots are a popular vegetable in Asia, and its
leaves and branches are used as livestock feed.
   But understanding of the plant has been hampered by its bizarre
life cycle. When first growing, bamboo spears shoot skyward at up
to 1.6 inches per hour, soaring as tall as 130 feet. The grass
flowers once every 30 years, and some stands take as long as 120
years. Most botanists die or retire by the time one generation of
the tall grass dies and another flowers.
   But on that fall day two years ago a glimmer of hope appeared.
If Mrs. Nadgauda and Mascarenhas could repeat the flowering, they
might be able to unlock bamboo's secret. With seeds from the
flowers, they could also crossbreed bamboo, another first.
   Success could aid the fight against deforestation ravaging much
of Asia. It also could increase production of bamboo. Success might
even help halt the extinction of China's giant panda, which relies
on the capricious plant for food.
   Using highly nutritious ingredients, Mascarenhas' team took
bamboo seedlings and tried to spark flowering.
   ``We invented a powerful brew,'' said Mascarenhas. ``We used
coconut milk but we also added some secret things. We felt a little
like witch doctors.''
   The scientists showered their plant cultures with care.
   ``You have to give love to your cultures to make them grow,''
Mascarenhas said. ``Of course, we are scientists but we also know
that nature moves in strange ways.''
   Mrs. Nadgauda had the best luck with the cultures. The
fiery-eyed 39-year-old is known in the laboratory as a woman who
does not suffer fools or stubborn cultures gladly.
   ``If I look at the cultures angrily, they grow,'' she said. ``I
treat them like my children. If they obey me, then I love them.''
   Mrs. Nadgauda said she would often place beakers of bamboo
seedlings on her desk and glare at them in the afternoon.
   The morning after one such scolding, Mrs. Nadgauda came to work
to find her cultures had sprouted flowers. The experiment had
succeeded. Within a few months, the ``bamboo team'' succeeded twice
more, prompting two species of bamboo to flower.
   In an editorial attached to the Nature article, David Hanke, a
professor of botany at Cambridge University, said the experiment
``opens up endless possibilities for the high emperor of all the
grasses.''
   Mascarenhas and Mrs. Nadgauda are more modest.
   ``We still have much work to do,'' said Mascarenhas. ``We are
perfecting the brew.''
   Bamboo comprises about 500 species scattered throughout the
world. But it is in Asia where it reigns supreme, cutting a verdant
swath through India's monsoon country, the valleys of China's
Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, over the Korean peninsula and into
Japan.
   In Hong Kong and Tokyo, bamboo scaffolding encases most
construction sites. On China's farms, bamboo hay feeds water
buffalo and pigs. Shoots of the young bamboo are stir-fried in
Shanghai and pickled in Bombay. In Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam,
bamboo trunks lift farmers' houses from the flood-prone plains. In
Bangladesh, where houses and humanity are constantly swept away by
cyclones and floods, bamboo is split and woven into mats that serve
as walls and roofs of hastily erected new dwellings.
   Mascarenhas hopes the ``bamboo team'' will soon be able to
perfect the flowering experiment and begin selling the technology
to other labs. ``Of course, we love the plants,'' he said, ``but we
could also use the money.''

<HEAD>Disputes Over Our Common Ancestors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Did we all descend from Eve, an African woman
whose offspring quite literally conquered the world?
   Though of course no one knows her name, some biologists and
anthropologists believe that all humanity traces its roots to just
one woman. This idea, known as the Eve hypothesis or the Garden of
Eden theory, is intriguingly simple:
   Eve lived in sub-Saharan Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. As
the ancestors of modern humans, her children and grandchildren
spread throughout Africa and eventually across the world,
triggering the extinction of other primitive peoples.
   Or so some scientists believe.
   Others ridicule the idea. The theory, based on a comparison of
the genes of people around the world, is one of the most hotly
conteste controversies in the often-rancorous field of human
origins.
   At a meeting earlier this year of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, both sides argued their cases with
facts, speculation and sarcasm.
   Allan C. Wilson of the University of California at Berkeley, one
of the architects of the Eve hypothesis, said the evidence is so
strong that the ``argument is done, clinched, finished. It's over.''
   Not quite, countered the other side.
   ``There are serious and obvious flaws in the Eve hypothesis,''
said Geoffrey G. Pope of the University of Illinois.
   Most everyone agrees that small-brained, humanlike creatures
arose in Africa 1.5 million to 2 million years ago. They spread
throughout Africa, Europe and Southeast Asia and flourished for
hundreds of thousands of years.
   But what became of them? The theory favored by Pope and many
fossil experts holds that those creatures, known as homo erectus,
are the true ancestors of us all.
   If they are right, these early hominids parted company in Africa
but went on to evolve in unison. Useful genetic changes that arose
in small pockets of population slowly spread throughout the world
as neighboring tribes mingled. After thousands of centuries, they
became us _ modern humans who differ only in superficial racial
features.
   However, Garden of Eden theorists believe those early settlers
disappeared leaving no trace in humanity's genes. Instead, they say
they have evidence that a new kind of people arose in Africa much
more recently. Their kin also spread throughout the prehistoric
world, somehow killing off or squeezing out the European
Neanderthals and other descendants of the first wave out of Africa.
   The difference between the scenarios is so stark that there
seems to be no middle ground, no room for compromise.
   ``There is no question on this issue,'' said Alan G. Thorne of
the Australian National University, an Eve skeptic. ``One of us is
absolutely wrong.''
   The debate began about three years ago with the use of new
scientific techniques to look for signs of the family tree inside
the genes of modern humans. This intrusion of the glitzy tools of
molecular biology have not always been accepted graciously by the
traditional fossil hunters, who rely largely on meticulous
measurements and comparisons of bone fragments to fathom human
origins.
   David W. Frayer, a Neanderthal expert from the University of
Kansas, said the quick acceptance of Eve reflects a preference for
sensational catastrophe over mundane gradual change, as well as a
``willingness of some to accept without criticism, or even
suspicion, the results of molecular biology.''
   Molecular biology's role has been to decipher the genetic
information inside mitochondria. These are structures within human
cells that help produce energy.
   Mitochondria have their own genes, separate from the chromosomes
that carry all the other blueprints for human beings. Ordinary
genes are a mishmash contributed equally by mothers and fathers.
Mitochondrial genes are passed along only by mothers.
   Therefore, each new generation gets an almost exact copy of the
mitochondrial genes of their forebears. The only difference is the
occasional variation caused by genetic mutations.
   These mutations are the key to reading mitochondrial genes as a
clock. Biologists believe they know how quickly the mutations
occur. By comparing the degree of mutation in the genes of people
from different parts of the world, they believe they can trace the
various lines back to the point at which they all converge: Eve.
   The latest study of this sort, conducted by Linda Vigilant at
Berkeley, uses hair roots plucked from 199 people from Europe,
Asia, New Guinea and seven ethnic groups in Africa. Analyzing the
root genes, she calculates all the people descended from a common
ancestor who lived in Africa 207,000 years ago. This female's
descendants evolved into physically modern humans by 100,000 years
ago.
   As neat as the idea seems, anthropologists attack it on several
grounds.
   One is whether the mutations in mitochondrial genes occur like
clockwork. The critics argue that the biologists are overly
confident that they know the tempo at which the mitochondrial clock
is ticking.
   Milford H. Wolpoff of the University of Michigan contends the
clock's rhythm is hopelessly thrown off by the dead ends of all-boy
families. Whenever a family produces no girls, the orderly
accumulation of genetic mutations stops cold. No mitochondrial
genes are passed to the next generation.
   ``If there is a clock,'' said Thorne, ``it needs new batteries.''
   Other scientists point to the fossil record, the teeth and bits
of bone that remain from the ancient beings.
   If the Eve theory is correct, the new wave of humans migrating
out of Africa 1,000 centuries ago did not mate and mingle their
genes with the ancient hominids that already lived in Europe and
Asia. Instead, they replaced them completely.
   Some fossil experts believe they have found clear signs that
traits of those ancient peoples have been passed down to modern
humans. For instance, Pope argues that 1 million-year-old fossils
from ancient Asia have the same cheekbones and wisdom teeth as
modern Asians.
   This similarity in facial features ``indicates that the Eve
hypothesis is completely untenable in Asia.''
   Frayer also believes he can see echoes of Neanderthal skulls and
teeth in later generations of Europeans.
   Allison S. Brooks of George Washington University questions Eve
on behavioral grounds. She said that if modern humans overran
Europe, replacing the dimwitted natives, there should also have
been a cultural revolution.
   However, she finds no abrupt change showing dramatically more
advanced stone tools or hunting techniques in Europe after the
supposed arrival of Eve's offspring.

<HEAD>Back to Basics for Good Nutrition and Weight Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tufts University President Jean Mayer, one of
the nation's best-known nutritionists, has taken much of the
confusion out of eating well and losing weight.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet &amp; Nutrition Guide,'' written with Jeanne
P. Goldberg, provides a compact and generally sensible path for
children and adults, but is somewhat disorganized and fairly
conservative.
   Mayer and Goldberg, a Tufts School of Nutrition professor, are
widely known for their newspaper column ``Food for Thought,''
written in a question-and-answer format. The same device is used in
the book, at the end of each chapter, which can make information
hard to find.
   For example, yogurt is discussed both in the main section of a
chapter that inclues adapting recipes to make them healthier and in
the question-and-answer section at the end of the chapter.
   With the plethora of diet plans available and labels on food
difficult to decipher, consumers need someone to cut a path through
it all. And Mayer and Goldberg offer reasonable advice and clear
explanations.
   Their book includes information on preventing food poisoning,
eating well in restaurants, vitamins and minerals, food
requirements at different ages and for those with various health
problems or conditions, and how to lose weight sensibly.
   That Americans are doing a poor job of feeding themselves seems
clear.
   ``You would probably think it outrageous if we suggested that
our paleolithic ancestors crouching in their caves may have been
routinely eating a better diet than do many Americans today,'' the
authors say.
   It need not be the case, and beginning with a tour of the
supermarket, the authors warn that shoppers' best nutritional
interests are not always served by marketing professionals.
   Overall, Mayer and Goldberg recommend a low-fat diet consisting
of foods either fresh or lightly processed, passing by many of the
prepared foods that have come on the market in the five decades
since the opening of the first supermarket, a King Kullen in New
York.
   They warn about tricky food labels: An ounce of all sorts of
cereals may have the same number of calories, but an ounce of corn
flakes is about a cup, while an ounce of granola may be just
one-quarter cup. Manufacturers are not required to use comparable
serving sizes, and many foods have no nutrition labeling at all.
   But while the authors note that labels can be vague about the
types of fats used, they do not point out that because
manufacturers must list ingredients in descending order by weight,
various kinds of sugar won't appear all together; shoppers should
beware of how they add up.
   There is plenty of information in the book on what various terms
on labels mean; how to get enough protein, even in a vegetarian
diet, without eating too much fat; how to adjust favorite receipes.
   Weight-loss advice is simple and traditional: Eat fewer
calories, generally by cutting fats and sugar, and exercise more. A
month's worth of menus is included.
   Where government scientists or agencies clash with other groups,
the book tends to be conservative. For example, on pesticides, it
repeats old arguments about toxins that naturally occur in foods
and concludes, ``But when you mesh all these factors together, and
weigh the risks and benefits, a general outcry against pesticides
is unwarranted.''
   With almost half the restaurant dollars going to fast-food
outlets, the appendix listing the calorie, salt and fat content of
fast-food items from three chains is very useful.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet and Nutrition Guide'' is being published
in April by Pharos Books.

<HEAD>Breast-Feeding May Not Protect Middle-Class Infants From Disease,
Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breast-feeding may not protect middle-class
urban infants in developed countries from infectious disease as it
does in the Third World, a new report says.
   The study found no effect on rates of upper or lower respiratory
illness, an ear condition called otitis media, or an inflammation
of the stomach and intestines called gastroenteritis.
   The study, done in Denmark, involved 500 infants whose health
and feeding practices were tracked over their first year with
monthly questionnaires.
   Previous studies have shown that breast feeding protects infants
from infectious disease in the Third World. But researchers have
reached conflicting conclusions about infants in developed
countries, maybe because of how they did their studies, researchers
said in the April issue of the journal Pediatrics.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics generally endorses
breast-feeding for full-term infants, saying it provides
nutritional, economic and psychological advantages as well as
bolstering the infant's disease-fighting immune system.
   The authors of the new study said their results probably apply
to middle-class populations in the United States but not to rural
or poor urban populations.
   The researchers were from the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center in New York, the Yale University
School of Medicine and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

<HEAD>Ozone-Sparing Gases May Contribute to Greenhouse Effect, Study</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Says
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gases being studied as replacements for
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons would contribute to global
warming, but less than chlorofluorocarbons do, a study says.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, called CFCs, are used in a variety of
products, but researchers want to find replacements because CFCs
destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere.
   The ozone shields Earth from solar rays that can cause skin
cancer.
   The new study notes that CFCs also promote global warming
through the greenhouse effect, because they can trap energy
radiating from Earth.
   Most replacement gases can also absorb that energy, researchers
said. But their potential contribution to global warming is only
about one-tenth that of CFCs, chiefly because they break down more
quickly in the atmosphere, researchers found.
   The work is reported in the April 5 issue of the British journal
Nature by scientists at E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. of
Wilmington, Del., and Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc.,
of Cambridge, Mass.
   In an accompanying editorial, Keith Shine of the University of
Reading in England said unrestrained emissions of the substitutes
could lead to ``climatically significant concentrations during the
next century.'' So it would be important to prevent unnecessary
releases, he wrote.

   Twenty states have expressed interest in
distributing Tennessee's nutrition guide for AIDS patients.
   ``Nutrition and HIV: Your Choice Makes a Difference'' is being
prepared for its second printing. Twenty states have asked to see
it and may distribute it, said a state nutrition specialist, Peggy
Wickwire.
   The booklet is intended to give patients with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome information on keeping up their energy and
maintaining their weight.
   ``Traditional diets don't work for them,'' Ms. Wickwire said.
``They need the opposite of keep-slim diets.''
   The guide also may be useful for people with other debilitating
diseases such as cancer, she said.
   The booklet is the brainchild of Matt Nelson, who heads the
state health department's AIDS Education and Social Work Service
division.
   Diseases that commonly strike AIDS patients affect what and how
much they can eat, Nelson said. ``You almost have to look at what
disease you have and what medicines you're on, then figure out what
foods are left for you to eat.''
   The guide gives tips on dealing with chronic fatigue, drug side
effects and food safety, Nelson said. ``AIDS patients can't fight
off germs and bacteria found in raw or undercooked food,'' he said.
   The Tennessee Department of Health and Environment is making
bookplates available to any state, city or group that wants to
print copies. Information on obtaining the plates is available from
Nelson at 615-741-7500.

   The United States in February recorded its
smallest trade deficit in more than six years, a $6.49 billion
imbalance that reflected a sharp drop in oil imports, the

   The Bush administration, which is counting on strong export
growth this year to boost a sluggish domestic economy, hailed the
dramatic narrowing of the deficit.
   But some private economists cautioned that the improvement
reported Wednesday could be short-lived, saying the big drop in oil
imports was unlikely to be sustained and the dollar's strength was

<HEAD>Shearson Loses $915 Million; Merrill Earnings Up Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. paid for what
analysts have termed the excesses of the 1980s in one $915 million
shot in the first quarter. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. took its post-boom
medicine earlier and showed a profit.
   The nation's top two brokerage firms reported quarterly earnings
Wednesday that reflect continued problems in the securities
industry, which still is looking to recover from the 1987 stock
market crash.
   ``In both cases there was a slowdown in the investment banking
sector, and that's true for most of the (brokerage) houses,'' said
Samuel Liss, a securities industry analyst with Salomon Brothers
Inc. ``It's a low revenue period.''
   Shearson's $915 million loss _ the biggest quarterly loss in
Wall Street history _ included a $630 million charge to pay for a
restructuring that included about 2,000 layoffs and the elimination
or reduction of several businesses. It also took a $157 million
charge for an accounting change in the way it pays for development
of computer software.
   The restructuring was implemented after parent American Express
Co. moved to seize tighter control of the nation's No. 2 investment
firm, which has struggled during a bad period on Wall Street
following broad expansion in the 1980s. American Express plans to
acquire all Shearson stock it does not own.
   Merrill Lynch, which reported a 16 percent profit rise, took a
$470 million charge in the 1989 fourth quarter to pay for its
restructuring. Those cost-cutting measures appeared to take hold in
the first quarter despite a revenue drop.
   Merrill's fourth-quarter charge gave the firm its first annual
loss since going public in 1971. Merrill plans to eliminate about
3,000 jobs by the end of 1990 and is divesting some product lines
and businesses.
   Merrill, Shearson and other Wall Street firms have been
struggling because of declines in stock market activity and key
businesses such as stock and bond underwriting and takeovers since
the 1987 stock market crash.
   The retrenchment is due in part to rapid expansion in the 1980s
to capitalize on explosive growth in all segments of the securities
business. As business lags, the major firms are forced to
consolidate.
   ``We're saying that in these weak market conditions, firms that
generate profits are doing pretty well,'' said Jeffrey Bowman, who
follows the securities industry for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Excluding its one-time charges, Shearson still lost $128 million
for the quarter on its securities business.
   ``The first-quarter operating loss before the restructuring
charge stems from a slowdown in overall business activity and other
first-quarter 1990 events,'' Shearson said.
   The first quarter loss before the accounting change equaled
$8.75 per share. That compared to a loss of $15 million, or 24
cents a share, in the same 1989 period. Revenue fell 15 percent to
$2.6 billion from $3 billion.
   Shearson said it increased litigation reserves by $50 million;
added $32 million to a loan-loss reserve primarily related to the
portfolio of its Boston Co. subsidiary; and lost $34 million
because of fluctuations in the junk bond market.
   Shearson said it had $54 million in income related to the
settlement of litigation in connection with the suspension of tin
trading by the London Metal Exchange in 1986.
   Merrill and Shearson reported lower investment banking revenue
as business remained sluggish in stock and bond underwriting and
merchant banking. Merrill's revenue fell 26.7 percent and
Shearson's 25 percent.
   Brokerage commission revenue was up 4.2 percent at Merrill and
down 5.3 percent at Shearson.
   At Shearson, revenue from market-making and principal
transactions also fell sharply, attributed in part to volatility in
the collapsed junk bond market. Shearson is selling its portfolio
of junk bonds held for investment.
   Merrill made $41.3 million, or 34 cents a share, in the first
quarter, compared with $35.5 million, or 29 cents per share, last
year. Revenue declined to $2.66 billion from $2.79 billion.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Sees Green in `Eco-Logical' Investment Trust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentally conscious investors have
attacked some Wall Street funds for failing to back up claims of
being earth-friendly. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. wanted to make sure it
avoided such criticism.
   With Earth Day approaching, Merrill has formed an investment
trust composed of what it calls ``environmentally responsible''
companies. Merrill even printed literature for the trust on
recycled paper in green, biodegradable ink.
   But Merrill hired four outside environmental groups to help set
up its ``Eco-Logical Trust 1990.'' The firm denies seeing the
environmental movement as another fad from which it can make a
buck, and independent environmentalists praised Merrill's handling
of the issue.
   ``The environmentalists selected those stocks that were
environmentally responsible,'' said Stanley Craig, national sales
manager for Merrill's unit trusts. ``These are not only good
companies but they are solid financially.''
   The scheme by the nation's largest brokerage is the latest
attempt since the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill last year to
capitalize on investor demand to make money while showing concern
about the environment. Other ``socially responsible'' investment
funds have existed since 1970.
   But in the rush to jump on the bandwagon, environmentalists have
criticized several new funds for investing in companies involved in
waste cleanup that nonetheless have pollution records Mother Nature
wouldn't be proud of.
   ``It's not just investing in companies that are dealing with
environmental cleanup. It's dealing with companies that are
themselves environmentally responsible,'' said Carsten Henningsen,
president of Progressive Securities Financial Services, a Portland,
Ore., investment adviser.
   The Merrill trust is a fixed portfolio of 29 stocks. Merrill
paid the environmental groups $35,000 to recommend 100 companies
they considered ``environmentally responsible.'' Analysts from five
big firms that will market the trust through their stockbrokers
then selected the companies with the best financial records.
   Investors profit if the value of the stock portfolio rises.
Merrill and the other brokerages make money from a 4 percent sales
charge on investments. ``Units,'' or shares in the trust, will cost
$10 each, with a minimum 100-unit buy.
   Merrill said it will donate 50 cents to the Washington-based
Environmental Federation of America for every 100 units sold, up to
the first $25 million invested in the trust. More money will be
donated as the trust grows.
   ``This is the way we want companies to make money out of the
environment _ by telling the truth about it,'' said Peter Camejo,
president of Progressive Asset Management in Oakland, Calif., who
helped set up the Merrill trust.
   Camejo alerted Merrill last year that some of the pollution
control companies in a trust formed after the Alaska oil spill were
polluters themselves. Merrill later offered to set up the new
trust. The pollution trust sold out in six days last July,
attracting about $125 million in investments.
   The new trust consists of 13 companies involved in pollution
control or abatement, 10 natural gas companies, two utilities and
four other companies with no direct environmental tie.
   Among the stocks are Apple Computer Inc., which recycles the
bulk of its waste; WalMart Stores Inc., which has a ``green
section'' in its stores for products that use recyclable materials
or have other environmental benefits; and Nucor Corp., which makes
steel out of scrap from cars and appliances.
   ``They've got some good companies in there,'' said Gordon
Davidson, executive director of the Coalition for Environmentally
Responsible Economies in Boston.
   ``The only thing, of course, is that there is no such thing as a
perfect company,'' he said. ``All these companies need to work to
improve their environmental performance.''
   But some environmentalists said that even if the companies in
Merrill's trust are pro-environment, investment vehicles are no
substitute for broader changes in corporate policy.
   ``This is Wall Street's version of green marketing,'' said
Greenpeace USA spokesman Peter Dykstra. ``Almost without exception
we have found that green marketing is far more marketing than
green.''
   ``What may be a bigger gain is a new marketing tool for Merrill
and a new opportunity to package itself as environmentally
concerned when the vast majority of its business will still be
conducted with blue-chip stocks in the auto industry or energy
industry,'' he said.
   Merrill officials said the firm recycles paper, glass and other
materials, and that while the trust prospectus was its first
printed on recyclable paper, it plans to print more that way in the
future.

<HEAD>Harold Simmons Challenges Lockheed Proxy Vote in Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Harold Simmons is going to
court to challenge the legality of the proxy contest he lost last
month for control of Lockheed Corp.'s board of directors.
   The federal suit, filed Wednesday on behalf of the
Simmons-controlled N.L. Industries in Houston, asked the court to
declare Simmons-backed nominees the winners or to set a new
election.
   The suit accuses the incumbent board of directors of illegally
engineering extra proxy votes through an employee stock ownership
plan and playing a variety of dirty tricks to ensure that Simmons
lost his fight.
   ``This action seeks to restore integrity to the recent election
of Lockheed's Board of Directors and to ensure integrity in future
elections,'' said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court.
   Bob Meder, a Lockheed spokesman, said the company declined to
comment because officials had not seen the lawsuit.
   Simmons lost a proxy fight for control of the aerospace
company's board at the March 29 shareholder's meeting, but he won
major concessions for big shareholders.
   Simmons contends that Calabassas-based Lockheed, the nation's
sixth largest defense contractor, has been mismanaged under the
leadership of Chairman Daniel Tellep.
   The Dallas investor's N.L. Industries owns 18.9 percent of
Lockheed's common stock. He paid about $530 million for his shares
and is sitting on a paper loss of about $100 million.
   Simmons was not available for comment on the lawsuit. A call to
his home was not answered and his spokesman did not immediately
return a phone message.
   The lawsuit accuses the company of starting the employee stock
ownership plan as ``an llegal entrenchment device'' whose votes
should have been disallowed in the election.
   If the plan's votes and a few so-far challenged proxies were
thrown out, Simmons' nominees would have won the election, the suit
contends.
   The employee stock plan represented a large portion of the
support for the current board, whose 14 incumbents won with support
ranging from 57.6 percent to 60.7 percent. The employee plan holds
nearly 20 percent of Lockheed's stock.
   Simmons has said he was dissatisfied with the way the trustee
for the employee stock ownership plan had voted a block of shares
believed to number at least 500,000 of the some 12 million shares
owned by the plan.
   Hours after the shareholders meeting, a spokesman for the stock
plan said the trustee did not receive voting instructions on the
large block, but still voted those shares for management.
   Simmons has said that in the absence of voting instructions,
those shares should not have been voted for either side. The
trustee, though, said it was his fiduciary responsibility to vote
all of the plan's shares.
   Lockheed said holders of 82 percent of its stock, 52,685,00
shares of the 63,192,196 outstanding, had cast votes.
   The lawsuit also accuses the company of taking a number of
last-minute steps to allegedly steal the election.
   These steps included moving the annual meeting up six weeks from
its usual date to rob N.L. Industries of time to prepare, and
sending out proxy materials that failed to mention the existence of
a competing slate of directors, the suit alleges.
   The suit also complained that managers refused to help N.L.
Industries approach Lockheed workers who would be voting to explain
Simmons's side of the dispute.
   Separately, Simmons struck a conciliatory note in an April 16
letter to Tellep that was disclosed in a filing he made Wednesday
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
   ``I firmly believe that, notwithstanding litigation, we can work
together productively to maximize share values for all Lockheed
shareholders, and I look forward to doing so,'' the letter said.
   Simmons suggested in the letter that Tellep explore ``the
feasibility of a $1 billion stock repurchase plan.'' He also
suggested the sale of non-strategic or underperforming assets to
raise about $1 billion.
   Lockheed spokesman Ron Meder declined to comment on the letter,
saying only, ``Basically it's just a rehash of all the issues
raised in the proxy contest.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a war looming at its shareholder meeting next
week, Norton Co. won one battle, lost another and fired more
ammunition to fight a takeover bid from Britain's BTR PLC.
   The flurry of events began Wednesday morning when Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis signed a law that would prevent BTR from wresting
immediate control over the Norton board.
   Hours later, the U.S. Court of Appeals turned down Norton's
request to delay its April 26 shareholder meeting for two months to
prepare its defenses.
   In the meantime, Norton filed a lawsuit alleging state law
prevents BTR from exercising any voting power at the shareholder
meeting. BTR called Norton's claim ``frivolous.''
   The sense of urgency was summed up by Bernard Nussbaum, an
attorney representing Norton, who told the Appeals Court: ``These
people have turned the April 26th meeting into a referendum on the
future of the company.''
   Norton last month rejected a $1.6 billion, $75-a-share offer
from BTR. But the British conglomerate threatened to remove
Norton's board of directors through a proxy fight at the
shareholder meeting.
   Part of Norton's strategy has been to stall BTR. Norton, a
leading maker of abrasives, insists it needs extra time to plan its
options, including seeking other investors to help fend off the bid.
   ``There's a whole world out there to explore,'' Nussbaum told
the Appeals Court, adding that if the meeting is held next week,
``the reality is the board would lose.''
   Nussbaum argued that under state law, a company not only must
weigh shareholder interests but also its duties to its employees,
customers, community and the regional economy.
   But Stuart Meiklejohn, representing BTR, said the company's
bylaws require Norton to hold the meeting April 26 and prohibit
changing the date.
   Meiklejohn said there is no evidence to suggest that Norton has
had any success in exploring alternatives. Instead, he argued,
Norton is simply trying to line up shareholders who would support
the company's position.
   The Appeals Court sided with BTR, upholding a U.S. District
Court ruling from last week. The Appeals Court said it agreed with
the lower court's interpretation of the Norton bylaws, stating that
the annual meeting must be held the fourth Thursday of April.
   Meanwhile, in its suit Norton said BTR had triggered a special
mechanism in Massachusetts law because more than 20 percent of
stockholders had tendered their shares. About 64 percent of the
shares have been tendered for BTR.
   The suit contends that under the state law, those people who
tendered their shares would not be able to vote for BTR.
   BTR responded that the suit ``shows just how desperate the
Norton board is.''
   ``We view today's legal maneuvering by Norton and its board as
without merit and a frivolous waste of company assets,'' the
company said.
   BTR representatives stressed that the company does not own the
shares that have been tendered. But Norton insisted that the
tendered shares signify ``beneficial ownership'' and are subject to
the law.
   Norton asked that the issue be decided quickly in state court,
since the issue strictly involves Massachusetts law.
   Norton's stall strategy got a boost early in the day when
Dukakis signed the new law, which took effect immediately.
   Under the law, only one-third of the directors could be elected
at one time, meaning BTR would have to wait at least a year to gain
majority control.
   BTR has vowed to continue with its bid despite the law.
   ``This bill gives companies a well-deserved fighting chance
against hostile raiders,'' Dukakis said in prepared remarks.
   He signed the law in Worcester, where Norton's headquarters are
located, declaring ``we must do all we can to protect our best
corporate citizens and their workers and families from having their
livelihoods wiped out.''
   John Nelson, the Norton chairman, told a cheering crowd of
workers that the company ``will continue to fight to remain
independent.''

<HEAD>Unions Hail Trustee Decision as Chance to Rebuild</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airline's unions praised a judge's decision to appoint a
trustee to run the airline, saying it vindicated their position in
the bitter 13-month battle against their ultimate foe, Frank
Lorenzo.
   ``Justice has finally been served by stopping the most renowned
corporate pirate of the past decade,'' said Michael J. Flynn,
president of Local 1690, which represents about 2,000 striking
Machinists in Atlanta.
   ``Ever since Frank Lorenzo took control of Eastern in 1986, we
watched our airline dismantled and sold for the benefit of Texas
Air,'' he said.
   ``The (union) has fought this injustice every step of the way in
the courts, in the Congress and with public opinion. Finally, the
truth has been seen by Eastern's creditors and shareholders, but
most important, by Judge Lifland.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland late Wednesday granted a
request from Eastern's unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee to
run the airline. The move took control from Lorenzo, who is
chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air.
   The decision was particularly sweet for the unions, who have
pushed for a trustee since Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection five days after a crippling strike began in March 1989.
The unions contended that Lorenzo was slowly bleeding Eastern to
death by shifting assets to Texas Air and Continental Airlines,
Eastern's largely non-union sister carrier.
   ``We're elated,'' said striking Machinist Mike Richy in Miami.
``We can't believe it. It's been a year coming.''
   In Atlanta, Machinists union leader Robert D. Taylor called the
judge's ruling a ``sad'' victory because it took 13 months too long.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``The union will rise to the occasion . .
. and rebuild this airline under new management.''
   Dick Nellis, an Atlanta representative of Eastern's pilots
union, sounded a similar note. He said he was ``overjoyed'' at the
ruling but added, ``it is really very sad that it has taken so long
for the system to recognize why the real Eastern employees left the
property in the first place.
   ``Literally, there have been thousands of careers that have been
shattered and billions of dollars of Eastern Airlines assets
wasted,'' he said. ``It is just a sad thing to think we had to wait
this long.''
   A small group of Machinists who were gathered at the Local 1690
hall in Forest Park, Ga., hooted for joy when they learned of
Lorenzo's ouster. They were more cautious about Martin Shugrue, the
former Continental president who was appointed as trustee.
   ``I will hold my judgment on Mr. Shugrue until we investigate
him,'' said Local 1690 vice president Tony Chapman. ``There is
reason to be cautiously optimistic. We are looking forward to
working with him any way possible.''
   E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilot Association in
Miami, said the appointment of Shugrue would give Eastern a new
lease on life.
   ``We've always felt that a change in management was the first
piece of the formula that would bring Eastern back to the
successful airline that it has been in the past,'' he said. ``Now
that that's been cleared, I really think that it means a future for
Eastern Airlines. It never had a future for the last 4{ years that
Frank Lorenzo was on the airline.''

<HEAD>Corn Genetics Work Expands Range Of Engineered Edibles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genetically engineered food could become as
common as corn by the end of this decade, say researchers whose
recent breakthrough in the field already has expanded the range of
products under development.
   Tomatoes that taste better and last longer will be among the
first genetically altered edibles submitted this year for federal
Food and Drug Administration approval, according to the company
that grows them.
   If the FDA gives the green light to tomatoes,
herbicide-resistant corn likely will be among the cornucopia of
products that follow _ because corn has just joined the genetic age.
   Two teams of researchers say they have produced genetically
altered corn plants capable of passing on their newly acquired
traits to the next generation, a problem that had stymied
scientists for years.
   The technique promises to produce new strains of disease-,
insect- and herbicide-resistant corn that researchers contend will
be better for livestock and people, and better for the environment.
   ``People have talked for a long time of the potential benefits
of genetic engineering of corn, but until you could put a gene in,
all that was hypothetical,'' said Thomas B. Rice, president of the
seed division of DeKalb Genetics Corp. of DeKalb, Ill.
   ``Now we'll find out,'' Rice said.
   A team of DeKalb researchers announced their success with corn
genetics Wednesday, two days after a group of Agriculture
Department and Monsanto Co. scientists announced similar findings
at the same conference in Keystone, Colo.
   Both groups used a ``gene gun'' to shoot microscopic gene-coated
bullets into corn cells, which were then grown into mature plants.
   The adult plants were fertilized with pollen and produced a new
generation of seedlings which were shown to have the same genetic
traits that had been engineered into their parents.
   Genetic engineering of corn, the largest and most valuable U.S.
farm crop, has long eluded researchers despite their success with
soybeans, cotton, tobacco and tomatoes, said Michael Fromm, a
molecular biologist at an Albany, Calif., research center operated
by the Agriculture Department and University of California at
Berkeley.
   Fromm, who headed the USDA-Monsanto research team, said the
technique used successfully with those crops involved a bacteria
that did not work well with corn and other grains.
   Researchers using the bacteria technique have developed products
such as better-tasting, longer-lasting tomatoes and
herbicide-resistant cottonseed. Calgene Inc., a Davis, Calif.,
company plans to apply this year for FDA approval of the tomato,
said Dan Wagster, Calgene's chief financial officer.
   With the FDA's permission, Calgene expects to market the
tomatoes beginning in 1993, Wagster said.
   But the FDA filing is likely to rekindle the debate over genetic
engineering, which critics fear will lead to the careless release
of new life forms with potentially disastrous consequences.
   Wagster said that ``what we expect with the application to the
FDA is that the controversy gets resolved.''
   The company hopes to document that its new tomato, now entering
its third year of field trials ``is still a food that is still safe
as well as an improved product.''
   He said Calgene's genetically altered cottonseed is immune to an
herbicide that is biodegradable and more concentrated than those
currently in use, but farmers can't use it because it kills cotton
plants as well as weeds.
   If the new cottonseed is approved, he said, cotton growers could
switch to that herbicide, saving them money and causing less damage
to the environment.

<HEAD>Amtrak Strike Threat Averted, But Some Pickets Appear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A potential nationwide strike by machinists
against Amtrak was averted early today by an agreement to try to
settle the dispute, a spokeswoman for Amtrak said.
   The strike had been called for 6 a.m., and pickets who
apparently did not get word of the agreement appeared in some
places, including South Station in Boston. But Sue Martin, Amtrak
senior director of public affairs in Washington, said service was
not affected.
   The dispute involved interpretation of an agreement between the
national passenger railroad and the International Association of
Machinists on union officers conducting union business on company
time.
   Ms. Martin said the agreement was being interpreted
inconsistently and that union leaders in some places ``essentially
were spending all day on union business and getting paid by
Amtrak.''
   Amtrak issued guidelines to remedy the problem, she said, but
union officials thought they were too narrow. Under the agreement
reached early today, the guidelines will be put on hold while the
two sides seek a resolution of their diferences, possibly through
arbitration or court action.
   Ms. Martin said she thought lawyers for both sides would meet
later today in Washington to make the agreement formal.
   Roy Wildman, a shop steward with Machinists' Local 318 in
Boston, said Amtrak has made it virtually impossible for union
officials to conduct any type of union business, including
grievances, on Amtrak property on company time.
   He said union officials could not even use company time for work
that would benefit Amtrak, such as arranging vacation times for
union members.
   The machinists inspect, maintain and repair the railroad
equipment, and by federal law, locomotives on the road must be
inspected every 24 hours, Wildman said.

   The stock market lost more ground today amid
persistent worries over rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.40 to 2,727.48
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 324 up, 621
down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.66 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said sentiment among traders was dominated by a recent
rise in interest rates and signs of stubborn inflationary pressures.
   Interest rates, up sharply Tuesday and Wednesday, climbed
further in credit-market activity today. Prices of long-term
government bonds dropped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face
value, putting their yields in the 8.86 percent-8.92 percent range.
   Brokers also said investors were giving mixed reviews to
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Digital Equipment rose 2{ to 82{. The company posted a big drop
in quarterly profits, but many Wall Streeters had been expecting
the news to be even worse.
   American Express, which reported a $619.80 million loss for the
first quarter, slipped \ to 28|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .36 to 186.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .67 at 352.55.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 32.89
points to 2,732.88, giving back nearly all of its 36.04-point gain
over the three previous sessions.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 471 up, 1,052 down and 473 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 147.13 million shares, against 127.99
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Edge Lower on Lithuania Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices edged lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that
Moscow's reprisals against Lithuania could jeopardize U.S. grain
sales to the Soviet Union.
   Reports that the Soviet Union had cut off oil shipments to the
breakaway republic triggered speculation that the United States
will back away from granting the Soviets most favored nation trade
status. The designation would allow for freer trade between the
superpowers.
   Forecasts for increasingly wet, warm weather in the Midwestern
croplands prompted further selling this morning. Rain was expected
in the region today and Friday, and the National Weather Service
has predicted above-normal temperatures for the Midwest during the
latter half of next week.
   Higher prices for soybean meal in Europe helped to limit losses
in the soybean market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.63} a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 1 cent lower with May at $2.72} a bushel; oats were {
cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.56{ a bushel; soybeans were {
cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $5.94\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures advanced, led by a surge in
pork-belly prices amid bullish chart signals.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
April at 79.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with April at 84 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .35 cent higher with April at 56.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to 1.58 cent higher with May at
60.90 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures were mixed on Wednesday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

   The stock market declined broadly today amid
persistent worries over rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.18 to 2,727.70
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 441 up, 855
down and 527 unchanged.
   Analysts said sentiment among traders was dominated by a recent
rise in interest rates and signs of stubborn inflationary pressures.
   Interest rates, up sharply Tuesday and Wednesday, climbed
further in credit-market activity today. Prices of long-term
government bonds dropped about $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields in the 8.85 percent-8.91 percent range.
   Brokers also said investors were giving mixed reviews to
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Digital Equipment led the active list and rose 1&lsqb; to 81&lsqb;. The
company posted a big drop in quarterly profits, but many Wall
Streeters had been expecting the news to be even worse.
   American Express, which reported a $619.80 million loss for the

<TEXT>
   Allied-Lyons PLC, the British liquor and food
company, said Thursday it was selling its Embassy Hotels chain to
Jarvis Hotels Ltd. for $331 million.
   The sale of the chain, which operates 41 hotels in Britain,
depends on Jarvis completing financing for the deal, Allied-Lyons
said.
   Jarvis is a newly formed hotel group headed by former Hilton
International Chairman and Chief Executive John Jarvis. Jarvis will
pay for Embassy Hotels with cash and debt, Allied-Lyons said.
   Allied-Lyons said the sale was in line with its plans to develop
its core operations, and that the proceeds would help reduce its
debt.
   Late last year, Allied-Lyons paid $325 million for the U.S.
doughnuts and coffee chain Dunkin Donuts Inc. and $894 million for
the liquor division of Whitbread and Co. PLC, a British brewing
group.
   Embassy reported a trading profit of $15.4 million on sales of
$94 million in the year ended March 1989. Trading profit is profit
before taxes and other items.
   Allied-Lyons posted a trading profit of $964 million on sales of
$7 billion in the same period.

   Control Data Corp. has reached a
tentative deal to sell VTC Inc., its money-losing computer chip
subsidiary, to Seattle Silicon of Bellevue, Wash.
   Under the proposed agreement, Seattle Silicon would buy the
assets of VTC in order to form a new company that hasn't been named.
   Control Data would hold a 20 percent stake in the new company,
which would be headed by Amaury Piedra, Seattle Silicon's president
and chief executive officer.
   Terms of the proposed agreement, announced Wednesday, were not
announced.
   The new company would continue to operate VTC's Bloomington
plant and keep nearly all of VTC's 400 employees, said Ed
Fernandez, vice president of marketing and sales for Seattle
Silicon.
   Larry Jodsaas, president of VTC, will stay with Control Data in
an undetermined position, said Control Data spokesman Frank Ryan.
   Expecting to sell VTC, Control Data took a $110 million charge
against its earnings last year. Control Data lost $680.4 million
last year, and has sold or closed several operations in an attempt
to achieve a turnaround.
   ``VTC is certainly the last obstacle to remove in the
restructuring of Control Data,'' said Nancy Foltz, a Control Data
spokeswoman. ``It was the only remaining business that consistently
lost money.''
   Control Data does not provide financial information on VTC,
which designs computer chips for the military and the disk drive
data storage industry.
   Seattle Silicon is a private, 6-year-old chip maker that has not
had its own manufacturing facility. It has been making chips
through alliances with other companies.
   In December, Control Data reached agreement to sell its
Ticketron division, which provides tickets to theaters, concerts
and sports events through a computer network.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   The buyers were a group consisting of Centre Group L.P. of
Landover, Md., Ogden Allied Services Corp. of New York, Wembley
Group of London and Carlyle Group, a private investment bank based
in Washington, D.C.
   Centre Group and Carlyle Group are co-general partners under the
new ownership. Centre Group consists of the Washington Bullets, the
Washington Capitals and their arena, Capital Centre.

   Perrier water will be back on the
shelves soon, but it won't have the same sparkle _ at least not on
the label.
   The Food and Drug Administration has ruled that the mineral
water's claim to be ``naturally sparkling'' is false and ordered
the American distributor to remove the phrase from bottles.
   ``The water comes out of the ground and the carbonation is
added,'' Bob Crowell, compliance officer in the FDA's Boston
district office, said today.
   Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America
Inc., in Greenwich, Conn., said the company believed its
description was accurate but would obey the FDA.
   ``We certainly want to comply with the FDA request, even though
in principle we do disagree with some of the language,'' Lazgin
said today. She said the company wanted to return Perrier to
supermarket shelves as soon as possible.
   Lazgin said bottles would return to the shelf next week,
beginning in New York, Miami and Washington. All Perrier bottled
after July 29 would bear the new label ordered by the FDA.
   Source Perrier S.A. of France began a worldwide recall of its
water in February after trace amounts of the carcinogen benzene
were discovered in some bottles.
   The uproar revealed that Source Perrier not only mechanically
added gas to its water but that the gas contained numerous
impurities that had to be removed.
   An unchanged filter containing some benzene from the gas
apparently was responsible for the contamination.

   A top Bush administration official said today
that the U.S. trade deficit could worsen this year and warned that
Japan's closed markets pose ``important risks for the world
economy.''
   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said that there is more at
stake than reducing America's huge trade imbalance. He said growing
protectionist threats could imperil world prosperity.
   ``If we are going to preserve the global trading system, we are
going to have to insist that Japan and others who share the
benefits do their part,'' Mulford said. ``Clearly, Japan has not
done its part.''
   Mulford's comments were part of the administration's continuing
campaign to pressure Japan to open its markets further for foreign
trade. Many have grown concerned that a big decline in the value of
the yen in recent months threatens to worsen the $49 billion trade
deficit between the two nations.
   A weaker yen would make Japanese products less expensive in this
country while making American goods more costly in Japan.
   ``The depreciation of the yen and Japan's relatively closed
markets are not sustainable over time as their continuation would
pose important risks for the world economy,'' Mulford said in
testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee.
   Mulford said that any further improvement in America's broadest
measure of trade, the current account, was likely to be ``very
modest and the possibility of deterioration in the current account
cannot be excluded.''
   Mulford's comments echoed the outlook in a new adminisration
assessemnt prepared by the Treasury Department which said further
improvement in the trade balance this year would be ``modest at
best.''
   While this forecast is in line with the view of many private
economists, it poses a threat to the optimistic economic
assumptions underlying President Bush's 1991 budget.
   A widening of the trade deficit would worsen the slump in
manufacturing as companies found it harder to sell their products
overseas. Further weakness in manufacturing could seriously depress
overall economic growth.
   The broadest measure of U.S. trade, the current account, posted
a deficit of $105.9 billion in 1989. It had posted an all-time high
of $143.7 billion in 1987. The current account measures both trade
in merchandise and services, a category that primarily reflects
investment flows between countries.
   So far this year, the merchandise portion of the trade deficit
has been on a roller coaster, surging to $9.32 billion in January,
only to drop to $6.49 billion in February as oil imports retreated
from a record high set the month before.
   Many private economists look for America's oil dependence to
deepen in coming months as domestic production slumps further.
Another negative factor on the trade front is the recent strength
of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Japanese yen.
   A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods less competitive on overseas
markets and makes foreign imports cheaper for American consumers.
   The United States has often joined with other leading industrial
countries in coordinated efforts to keep currency rates in line as
a way at attacking trade imbalances.
   The Group of Seven nations _ the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy _ last met in Paris
earlier this month. They promised then to continue their
coordination efforts but rejected petitions by Japanese officials
for stronger action to bolster the sagging yen.
   In the trade assessment, the administration declared that ``the
yen's weakness is a matter of concern, with undesirable
consequences for the global adjustment process.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady gave a similar view in
congressional testimony but did not offer any specific actions the
administration was willing to take.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan widened to $3.12 billion in
February from $2.86 billion in January.
   The administration's trade report said the dramatic political
changes occurring in Eastern Europe had the potential of easing
global trade imbalances.
   The report said the unification of West and East Germany should
help lower West Germany's large trade surpluses because the united
country would have more demand for imported products. However, it
said, the prime beneficiaries of this development were likely to be
other countries in Europe, not the United States.
   On another point, the report said Taiwan and South Korea had
made progress in liberalizing their currency exchange-rate policies
but that both nations need to make further progress.
   The two countries had been cited in previous reports for
manipulating their currencies in order to bolster their export
sales, particularly with the United States, their primary foreign
market.

   OPEC will hold an emergency session of
its ministerial monitoring committee on May 2 to examine how to
stop the fall in crude oil prices, the organization's current
president, Sadek Boussena, announced Thursday.
   The full OPEC conference scheduled for May 25 in Geneva could be
postponed until June 26, a statement by Boussena, the Algerian oil
minister, said.
   The statement did not disclose where the meeting would be held,
but said all 13 member nations of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would be represented. Normally, eight nations
take part in the ministerial monitoring committee.
   The announcement of such a meeting follows a series of
consultations between Boussena and OPEC partners about the drop in
oil prices. Boussena said consultations would continue to try to
identify ``practical temporary measures'' which could be put into
place ``with little delay.''
   The current OPEC reference price for crude oil is $18 a barrel.
Production rates are fixed at 22 million barrels per day.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson to Buy Marshall Field's</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATEs with comments from Chicago news conference; minor
editing throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp. today announced an
agreement to buy the Marshall Field &amp; Co. department store chain
for about $1.04 billion from BAT Industries PLC, a British
conglomerate.
   The purchase of the famous Chicago-based retailer is expected to
be completed within two months. The deal will link two of the
Midwest's most prominent retailers and will expand
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson's presence in Chicago and several
other regional cities.
   The definitive agreement with Batus Inc., BAT's U.S. subsidiary,
must be approved by regulators.
   Dayton Hudson said it planned to keep all 24 Marshall Field's
stores in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas open for business.
   ``This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to add another
premier name to our department store division,'' said Kenneth A.
Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Macke said at a news conference in Chicago that he anticipates
``no problems in financing the deal,'' and added junk bonds would
not play a role.
   He said it was too early to say what part current Field's
chairman Philip Miller would play in the chain's future. But Macke
and Stephen Watson, president of Dayton Hudson, both praised the
role Miller has had in Field's over the past five years.
   For his part, Miller, who with other managers had mounted a
buyout offer of their own, said he was disappointed his group had
lost.
   ``We thought we were looking like the front runner,'' said
Miller. ``It's always a surprise when you lose.''
   Marshall Field's, one of the country's best known department
store groups, was put up for sale last year by BAT as part of a
restructuring to defend itself against a hostile takeover bid by
Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT, a large conglomerate with interests ranging from tobacco to
financial services and retailing, also is selling its Saks Fifth
Avenue division.
   Dayton Hudson's department store division operates 37 stores
known as either Dayton's or Hudson's in their respective markets in
seven Midwestern states.
   ``Our department store division is among the most profitable in
its industry and has produced 11 percent compound annual profit
growth for the past 5 years. Its consistent performance over the
last several years supports this acquisition,'' Macke said in a
prepared statement.
   ``We are very excited about the synergy created by these
powerful department store names _ Marshall Field's, Hudson's and
Dayton's, each one dominant in its markets,'' he said.
   The newly acquired Marshall Field's will report to Marvin W.
Goldstein, chairman and chief executive officer of the department
store division. Dayton Hudson is in the process of building two
replacement and three new department stores by 1992. The addition
of the Field's stores will bring the total number of stores in the
division to 64.
   Goldstein said the company expects that there will be
consolidation of some functions but that those decisions will be
made in the coming weeks.
   The acquisition will be financed with a combination of
internally generated funds and a mix of debt instruments, the
retailer said. Dayton Hudson does not plan an equity offering.
   The corporation recently reported record revenue and earnings
for the last fiscal year, with revenue up 12 percent to $13.64
billion and income up 43 percent to $410 million.
   In 1989, Dayton Hudson's department store division's revenue was
$1.8 billion and its operating profit was $179 million. The
division has more than 22,000 employees.
   Dayton Hudson also owns the Target chain, one of the country's
biggest discounters with 408 stores in 32 states, and Mervyn's, a
moderate-priced department store company with 221 stores in 15
states.

<HEAD>Digital's Quarterly Profit Plunges, Unisys Loses $3.2 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., the nation's second-largest computer
maker, reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings Thursday, while
No. 2 Unisys Corp. said it lost $3.2 million for the first quarter.
   Digital, which has been reducing its work force through a costly
severance program, said the results were better than expected.
   For the quarter ended March 31, Digital earned $24.9 million, or
20 cents a share, compared with $256 million, or $2.05 per share,
during the same period a year earlier. Earnings for the most recent
quarter were $1.40 a share before a restructuring charge stemming
from the severance plan, the company said.
   Digital's revenues for the period, which is the company's third
fiscal quarter, totaled $3.26 billion, up 4 percent from $3.13
billion for the third quarter last year.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Digital earned
$331 million, or $2.65 a share, on sales of $9.58 billion, compared
with earnings of $759 million, or $5.94 a share, on sales of $9.25
billion a year earlier.
   Digital has offered voluntary severance to 2,000 employees in
recent months, with 700 accepting. This week, Digital announced
another round of voluntary severance packages, for 1,800 workers in
Puerto Rico.
   The cost of the employee-reduction program was $150 million in
the most recent quarter, said Digital, which is based in Maynard,
Mass.
   Digital said earlier that it was walking a fine line between
recording a profit or a loss for the quarter.
   ``The numbers came in a lot better than expected,'' said Mark
Steinkrauss, a Digital spokesman.
   Digital officials said there could be more restructuring, but
they declined to be specific.
   The company, along with other computer makers, has been hurt by
slow U.S. sales. But Steinkrauss said Digital's U.S. revenues were
up 4 percent during the quarter, marking the first growth in a year.
   ``It's not quite as catastrophic a story as it might have
been,'' said Terry Shannon, an analyst at International Data Corp.
   At Unisys, which is based in Blue Bell, Pa., the first-quarter
loss came to 19 cents per common share, compared with a loss of
$78.7 million, or 66 cents a share, in 1989's first quarter.
   Revenue totaled $2.31 billion, up from $2.2 billion a year ago.
   Operating income was $86 million in the first quarter, compared
with an operating loss of $37 million a year earlier.
   ``Our priority in 1990 is to make our business operations
profitable and to bring down the company's debt level,'' James A.
Unruh, Unisys' president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement. ``We made progress in both of these areas in the first
quarter despite a mixed business environment.''
   Unruh said international business was strong during the quarter,
but ``our U.S. computer business, which has been sluggish for the
past two years, remains weak and we are cautious about the business
environment in general.''
   He said he expects benefits from last year's restructuring to be
seen in the second half of this year.

   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Thursday its earnings
fell 12 percent in the first quarter, mostly because of lower
prices and lower profit margins for most pulp and paper products.
   The wood products company reported earnings of $130.1 million,
or 61 cents a share, compared with $148.1 million, or 70 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales slipped 1.7 percent to $2.28 billion from
$2.32 billion.
   George H. Weyerhaeuser, chairman and chief executive, told the
annual shareholders meeting that the weakness in pulp and paper
products was only partially offset by better results in forest
products and other areas.
   In timberlands and forest products operations, the company said
prices for logs, lumber and plywood improved and its engineered
fiber panels and building materials segments did significantly
better. Weyerhaeuser's mortgage banking operation also returned to
profitability and its savings and loan subsidiary showed a stronger
quarterly performance.

   At issue are what is known in the industry as ``foxing-like
bands'' that connect many makes of athletic shoe uppers to their
soles.
   Nike says Air Jordans don't have the bands. The government says
they do, and that makes the $120 shoes competitive with domestic
manufacturers' styles with the bands.
   In a 10-page ruling sent Wednesday to U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood,
the Customs Service reaffirmed a preliminary finding last year that
the imitation-leather versions of Air Jordans have foxing-like
bands.
   Nike says the extra duty has been adding $10 to $12 to a pair of
Air Jordans' retail price since mid-1989, when the agency first
ruled on the matter.
   The company has had to pay $8 million to $9 million so far on
the 3.2 million pairs that have been imported thus far.
   ``What they've done is charge all that excess money to the U.S.
consumer, and it's not protecting anything,'' said Carl Davis,
Nike's corporate lawyer in Washington, D.C.
   Air Jordans are assembled with a ``foot frame'' method that
attaches soles to uppers differently, he said.
   ``The game's not over yet,'' he added. ``The only decision we
have made is that we'll continue to fight it.''
   Davis said the next step would be an appeal to the U.S. Treasury
Department, which oversees the Customs Service, or to the U.S.
Court of International Trade.

   Stock prices sagged today under the weight of
persistent worries about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.33 to 2,724.55
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 527 up, 902 down and

rise in interest rates and signs of stubborn inflationary pressures.
   Interest rates, up sharply Tuesday and Wednesday, climbed
further in credit-market activity today. Prices of long-term
government bonds dropped about $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields in the 8.85 percent-8.91 percent range.
   Brokers also said investors were giving mixed reviews to
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   Digital Equipment rose 1~ to 81~ in active trading. The company
posted a big drop in quarterly profits, but many Wall Streeters had
been expecting the news to be even worse.
   American Express, which reported a $619.80 million loss for the
first quarter, dropped 1 to 27~.

<HEAD>Quarterly Net Income Inches Up 1 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp.'s first-quarter profit
edged slightly higher while its per-share earnings dropped 11
percent and the company said Thursday the results reflected an
absence of Brazilian cash interest payments and more outstanding
stock.
   The San Francisco-based parent of Bank of America earned $278
million in the three months ended March 31. That was up 1 percent
from $275 million in 1989's first quarter, when BankAmerica
received $46 million in Brazilian interest payments, which
increased net income in that period by $38 million.
   Earnings per share fell to $1.23 in this year's first quarter
from $1.38 a year earlier. The number of common shares outstanding
increased 12 percent over the year.
   ``First-quarter earnings demonstrate continuing success in
managing the fundamental areas of our business, producing growth in
the volumes of deposits and loan originations, as well as
continuing strong credit performance,'' said Chairman A.W. Clausen.
   BankAmerica in January reported a 52 percent increase in its
1989 earnings, a $1.1 billion figure that represented the highest
annual profit ever for the nation's second-largest bank holding
concern.
   As of May 24, Clausen will step down from BankAmerica, the
company he joined in 1949 and rose through the ranks to head.
Replacing him will be Richard Rosenberg, BankAmerica's vice
chairman.
   Bank of America has 850 California branches.

<HEAD>Citing Shearson Shortfall, Reports $620 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. reported Thursday it lost
$620 million in the first quarter due to losses at its Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. brokerage subsidiary.
   The loss, which translates to $1.50 a share, compares with
earnings of $251.9 million, or 59 cents a share in the same period
a year earlier.
   American Express said its revenue for the quarter totaled $5.9
billion, up 1.4 precent from $5.87 billion in the first three
months of 1989.
   On Wednesday, Shearson said it lost $915 million in the first
three months of 1990, the biggest quarterly loss in Wall Street
history. The loss included $787 million in charges against earnings
and a $128 million operating loss.
   American Express, which currently holds about 61 percent of
Shearson, said its share of the investment firm's operating loss
was $96 million, but that it would recognize the entire $787
million in charges because of its plan to acquire all of the
outstanding shares in Shearson it  travelers checks operations, reported
a 16
percent increase in income to $215 million.
   The IDS Financial Services division, a financial planning
business, had a 21 percent increase in income to $44 million.
   And American Express Information Services Co. had a 27 percent
gain in income to $22 million.
   But the company's American Express Bank, which generally
operates outside of the United States, reported earnings of $30
million, down from $35 million a year earlier.
   Shearson's loss, which had been expected, was partly attributed
to a $630 million charge against earnings to pay for a
restructuring that included thousands of layoffs and the
elimination or reduction of several businesses.
   The remaining $157 million charge was also attributed to an
accounting change in the way Shearson pays for development of
computer software.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted
by a late flurry of buying linked in part to delays in the South
American soybean harvest.
   Rainy weather and sweeping economic reforms have slowed the
movement of soybeans and soybean meal from Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, analysts said.
   Some of Thursday's strength in soybean meal futures reflected
buying of contracts by users looking to lock in purchase prices in
case the South American shipping delays continue, said Joel Karlin,
an analyst with Research Department Inc., a Chicago-based brokers'
advisory service.
   The crop markets had opened mostly lower amid concerns that the
Soviet Union's reprisals against Lithuania could jeopardize U.S.
grain sales to Moscow.
   But those fears were overshadowed by the soybean rally and by
ideas the Soviet Union is seeking to buy more U.S. corn, Karlin
said.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were } cent to 3} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.69 a bushel;
corn was 2} cents to 3} cents higher with May at $2.77{ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to \ cent higher with May at $1.57{ a bushel;

<HEAD>House Panel Approves $1.2 Trillion 1991 Budget Bearing Defense
Cuts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New thruout with House panel action. Also moving on general
news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plans for nearly $300 billion
in defense spending next year came under attack today on Capitol
Hill where House budget writers approved deep cuts and Sen. Sam
Nunn called for reduction of U.S. forces in Europe.
   The House Budget Committee passed 21-14 a $1.24 trillion
Democratic-written budget that slashed $8 billion from the
president's plan for Pentagon spending.
   The full House is scheduled next week to debate the Democratic
proposal to shift the Pentagon money to domestic programs.
   While the House panel was completing its work, Nunn, the Georgia
Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposed
force reductions in Europe well below the 225,000 baseline proposed
by Bush.
   ``We should start planning on a residual force in Europe on the
order of 75,000 to 100,000 troops within five years,'' Nunn said in
a speech certain to create a furor within the military services.
   Nunn's speech coupled with the House committee action
represented the fullest statement of budget priorities by Congress'
majority Democrats since the Warsaw Pact disintegrated.
   ``The president's budget virtually ignored the opportunities
presented by the dramatic changes taking place in the world,'' said
committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``This budget meets that
challenge head-on.''
   ``We have a chance to restore the traditional peacetime
priorities of our nation at a time when we are faced with
tremendous economic challenges at home and abroad,'' said Panetta.
   Republicans opposed the Democratic plan and insisted that no
serious 1991 budget will be written until congressional leaders and
the White House hold negotiations.
   ``We look on this as a Democratic exercise you need to pass
through before we go to a summit'' to bargain over the budget, said
the panel's ranking Republican, Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota.
``That's fine with us.''
   The plan contains $36 billion in deficit reduction and claims to
reduce next year's budget gap to $63.5 billion. That would satisfy
the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement for a 1991 shortfall of no more
than $64 billion. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   It would spread $6 billion in spending increases among
initiatives ranging from highway construction to anti-drug efforts
and expanded child care.
   For its savings, the package relies on $11.5 billion in military
cuts, $13.9 billion in new taxes _ the same amount Bush is seeking
_ and $5.6 billion in user fees. It reduces the expected growth of
Medicare and other benefit programs by $4.2 billion, and claims
minor savings in several other areas.
   Its most controversial element is how defense would be treated
in the first federal budget since the disintegration of the Warsaw
Pact.
   Panetta's package would leave next year's military budget at
$295 billion in outlays, which is about $1 billion less than is
being spent this year and $11.5 billion less than what would be
needed to stay even with inflation. The figure also is $8 billion
below the amount Bush is seeking.
   More importantly for the long run, Democrats would also cut next
year's military budget authority to $283 billion, some $18 billion
below this year and $33 billion less than the amount needed to keep
up with inflation. Budget authority is the amount of spending
allowed by an agency over a number of years. The reduction is
crucial because if enacted, it would signal the beginning of a
long-range decline in Pentagon spending.
   The plan had originally called for $286 billion in defense
budget authority, but liberals on the budget panel threatened not
to support the package unless the figure was reduced.
   Over the next five years, defense savings would total $251
billion, a shrinkage of military spending of 25 percent from
current projections. Democrats would disperse $106 billion to
domestic programs and apply the remaining $145 billion to shrinking
the budget gap.
   The defense figures were worked out in concert with House
leaders, who now begin the job of selling them to fellow lawmakers.
   ``It's a good-sized down payment on greater savings to come,''
said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee.
   But there is dissatisfaction on both sides of the aisle with the
defense figures for several reasons.
   ``We look on it as a meltdown, not a build-down,'' Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the budget panel, said
of the Democrats' treatment of the Pentagon.
   Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., a liberal, said the figures
seemed ``totally inadequate'' because they did not cut deeply
enough. A member of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee,
Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., complained that budget authority was
treated too harshly, saying, ``It would be difficult for me to live
with that low a number.''
   Progress on the budget is going even more slowly in the Senate.
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., is uncertain
whether he has enough votes to approve a spending plan, which he
wants to include a $15 billion defense cut.
   The congressional budget document, which does not require the
president's signature, is used as a blueprint for the government's
fiscal plans. Actual spending and tax decisions are made in other
bills later in the year.

<HEAD>Crunch Time for Milken as Government Deadline Approaches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the government's promised date for a new
indictment arrives, financier Michael Milken faces the biggest
decision in his lengthy securities fraud case: to plead or not to
plead.
   Attorneys for Milken and the government are involved in
negotiations for a possible settlement in the criminal prosecution
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s former high-yield bond chief,
sources said Thursday.
   But it was unclear whether the talks would result in a plea
bargain tossing aside a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment
of Milken or whether new charges would be levied by Friday, as the
government has promised, and the case proceed to trial.
   Individuals close to the case said discussions included a
possible guilty plea to more than one felony count and penalties in
the range of $650 million. But they cautioned the talks did not
imply Milken was near agreeing to a plea deal.
   ``How much can anybody take? It's a very stressful, annoying
kind of day-to-day living,'' said one attorney with knowledge of
the case. ``(Milken) has to decide whether his position is improved
in cutting a deal now or by hanging tough.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll told a federal judge
last month that the government would submit an expanded indictment
by the end of this week. Carroll declined to comment Thursday, as
did a Milken spokesman.
   The original indictment of Milken, his brother, Lowell, and
former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg amounted to the largest
financial crime prosecution in U.S. history. It was handed up in
March 1989.
   The indictment is based largely on information supplied by
former stock speculator Ivan Boesky, who recently was released
after completing two years of a three-year prison sentence.
   It is widely assumed that new charges would include allegations
stemming from activity that did not involve Boesky, who was
implicated in a broad insider trading network and could be an easy
target for defense lawyers.
   By pleading guilty, Milken and the government would avoid a
long, costly trial. Milken would avoid a possible jury conviction
on dozens of criminal counts that would carry years in prison. The
government would avoid the potential embarrassment of losing the
most highly touted case in its four-year-long Wall Street fraud
crackdown.
   But sentencing would rest with U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood,
so it is impossible to negotiate specific prison time through a
plea bargain.
   Legal observers said the government is unlikely to agree to a
one-count plea with a maximum of five years in prison. A single
racketeering count carries a maximum 20-year sentence, which also
is considered unlikely. Boesky's three years is viewed as a base.
   ``I think there is a slow process by which a defendant who
believes he is innocent is gradually convinced by his attorneys
that settlement is the best and most realistic course,'' said John
C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University.
   Milken has pleaded innocent and has said through his attorney,
Arthur Liman, that he intends to fight his case at trial.
   In addition to ending his ordeal, Milken may be willing to
settle if he can cut a deal exonerating his brother, legal experts
who have followed the case said. Civil charges also still must be
resolved.
   Milken, 43, is credited with developing the $200 billion market
in high-risk securities called junk bonds that were used widely in
the 1980s to finance corporate growth and hostile takeovers.
   The decision by Milken _ a proud man who strongly believes he
helped American finance _ on whether to plead guilty is made even
more difficult because he is convinced of his innocence, friends
say.
   ``He knows in his heart of hearts that he has total integrity,''
said Dick Riordan, a Los Angeles lawyer and friend of Milken's.
``Now to be told that he doesn't is a hard thing to swallow, very
hard.''
   Drexel settled fraud charges with the government and the
Securities and Exchange Commission last year by agreeing to pay
$650 million in penalties and plead guilty to six felonies. The
Drexel fine is seen as a benchmark for a Milken plea.
   Drexel collapsed in February and is liquidating after its parent
company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection.

   Frank Lorenzo, whose control of Eastern Airlines
has been seized by a federal bankruptcy judge, pledged Thursday to
help the court-appointed trustee assuming the helm.
   ``We're going to help in all reasonable ways that we can,''
Lorenzo said in an interview the day after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland designated a trustee to run financially sagging
Eastern.
   After a four-day hearing that ended late Wednesday, Lifland
granted the request of Eastern's unsecured creditors to take
control of the airline from Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp.
   The creditors, who are owed around $980 million, were angered by
Eastern's relentless losses and management's plans to slash debt
repayments.
   Miami-based Eastern, which had fought the creditors' request in
court, said Thursday it would not appeal Lifland's appointment of a
trustee. The airline has been in bankruptcy reorganization since
March 1989, when a strike by employees shut down its operations.
   While pledging to support the new trustee, airline executive
Martin Shugrue, Lorenzo acknowledged that the change in leadership
could prompt some Eastern managers to quit.
   ``It's very difficult to project the future,'' he said. ``There
may well be people leaving...but we're just going to have to see.''
   Several Eastern executives, including President Phil Bakes,
testified in the course of the hearing that appointment of a
trustee would cause employee departures, hurt business further and
heighten the chance Eastern eventually would have to be liquidated.
   Lorenzo said the end of his stewardship of Eastern was a relief
in some ways, since it will allow him to focus full attention on
Continental Airlines, Eastern's non-union sister carrier.
   Shugrue, a former president of Houston-based Continental,
resigned under pressure from Lorenzo. But Lorenzo said Thursday
that the decision to let Shugrue go was made by Continental's board
of directors.
   ``Marty is an able airline operator,'' Lorenzo said of Shugrue.
``And he's going to have our support.''
   Continental will continue to cooperate with Eastern in joint
marketing efforts and frequent flier programs, Lorenzo said.

<BYLINE>Service Sector Helping Inflate Consumer Prices</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of a Radisson hotel room in Knoxville, Tenn., has gone
up by $5. The soup-and-salad bar tab at an Indianapolis Howard
Johnson's restaurant jumped 29 percent. And the Peddie School in
Heightstown, N.J., is hiking tuition and room and board $1,500 per
student in the coming academic year.
   A slowing overall economy has helped curb some inflation. But
price increases in the service sector _ spurred by higher wages,
skyrocketing insurance costs and a shortage of workers _ are
leaving no American wallet untouched.
   ``We're all paying a little more,'' said James F. Smith, a
finance professor at the University of North Carolina.
   Recent government figures sent mixed signals about inflation.
The price of finished goods slipped 0.2 percent in March, and
further declines in food and energy prices should keep wholesale
inflation below last year's rate. But consumer prices jumped an
unexpected 0.5 percent last month _ the equivalent of an 8.5
percent annual inflation rate.
   Economists agree that the service sector accounts for the
divergence. The cost of services are factored into consumer prices
but are not a component of the government's producer price index.
   ``It seems that the majority of Americans are employed in the
service sector, and that's why inflation seems to be bigger
problem,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at MMS International in
Chicago.
   Some parts of the service sector have dramatically improved
their efficiency, especially banking, retailing and other
businesses that have benefited from the information revolution,
which lowered costs through automation, Smith said.
   But a shortage of workers in several regions of the country and
the first increase in the minimum wage in nearly a decade are
pumping wages higher.
   While only about 3 million Americans earn the minimum wage _
which increased April 1 to $3.80 an hour from $3.35 _ it sets a
floor for other lower-paying jobs.
   And the cost of higher wages filter through the economy.
   ``We're like anybody else,'' said Tom Polski, a spokesman for
the Radisson chain. ``If the cost of doing business goes up, it has
to be passed on to customers.''
   Timothy Kennedy said the higher minimum wage has added $90,000
to the $1 million-a-year payroll at the Radisson hotel he manages
in Knoxville. Sixty percent of his employees earn the minimum wage.
   To compensate, Kennedy has boosted room rates by $5 a night,
raising the basic single-occupancy rate to $65 a night. And because
the other service businesses that feed his hotel are also hiking
their prices because of higher costs, the price of a typical menu
item at the hotel's restaurant rose by about $1.
   In areas where workers are in short supply, employers must pay
even more to attract them.
   At McDonald's Corp., which boasts it is not a minimum wage
employer, the average worker earns $4.80 an hour, a spokesman said.
But many employees in the Boston area, where workers are in demand,
earn as much as $7 an hour.
   Service sector inflation also is shown by other factors, like
rising insurance premiums, which account for sharply higher total
labor costs.
   ``The fastest growing component of the consumer price index is
medical care, which rose more than 18 percent over the past 12
months,'' said Raymond Stone, of Stone and McCarthy Associates, a
consulting firm in Princeton, N.J.
   At the Peddie School, headmaster Tom DeGray said the school is
raising tuition and room and board from the current $14,000 a year
to $15,500 this September to help meet mushrooming insurance costs
as well as higher teachers' salaries.
   Teachers' salaries ``are moving up at about 8 percent a year,
but insurance costs are going out of sight,'' DeGray said.
   This year the school will pay about $420,000 for medical
insurance for its 150-member faculty and staff; just four years ago
the school was paying $240,000 a year for greater benefits.
   Charles Galbraith, the school's business manager, said if
insurance costs go up only 33 percent this year he'll be happy.
   The ability to pay competitive salaries and keep costs in line
for customers require balancing skills that are becoming harder for
businesspeople to master.
   ``Unless we continue to improve salary and benefits, we're not
going to be able to keep the finest faculty and attract them,''
DeGray said. And it's no secret who's going to pay for those
improvements.

   Southmark Corp. has reached an agreement that will
allow it to sell its insurance company and move closer toward
reorganization.
   The agreement with its common and preferred shareholders to sell
Integon Corp. should help the troubled company, which has operated
under bankruptcy court supervision since last July, rebound from
its financial woes.
   ``I think we got a real chance to get this thing out of
bankruptcy,'' Southmark chairman Arthur Weiss said Wednesday.
   Southmark offered in January to give equity stockholders 11
percent of the restructured company. But earlier this month, the
company reduced that offer to 5 percent.
   After further talks, Southmark agreed to give 11 percent of the
reorganized company to equity shareholders and to give the
committee a consulting role.
   The company's unsecured creditors settled their objections to
Southmark's plan earlier this month. The plan would turn over
control of the restructured company to its creditors, liquidate
most assets and reorganize around its Houston-based thrift.
   The sale of Integon to Chicago-based Jupiter Industries Inc. and
Head Insurance Investors is a complicated cash, stock and note
transaction valued at about $189 million. However, Southmark would
get $36 million in cash.

   Stock prices fell for the second straight
session today under the weight of persistent worries about rising
interest rates.
   Analysts said sentiment among traders was dominated by a recent
rise in interest rates and signs of stubborn inflationary pressures.

<HEAD>Perrier to Remove `Naturally Sparkling' Claim from its Bottles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has told Perrier
to remove the phrase ``naturally sparkling'' from bottles of the
imported mineral water, and the U.S. distributor said Thursday it
plans to comply.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Perrier's claim to be
``naturally sparkling'' is false because the water is not naturally
carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring in Vergeze,
France.
   The water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a
gas reservoir beneath it and are combined in the factory after
impurities in the gas are filtered out.
   ``The water comes out of the ground and the carbonation is
added,'' Bob Crowell, compliance officer in the FDA's Boston
district office, said Thursday.
   Perrier, which plans to reintroduce its product next week after
a worldwide recall, said it will comply.
   Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America Inc.
in Greenwich, Conn., said the company will obey the FDA, although
it believes its product is ``naturally sparkling.''
   ``While we do not agree with the need for these changes and feel
that our label has always adequately and accurately described our
product, we have made these changes to comply with the FDA request
and to act responsibly in quickly returning Perrier to our
consumers,'' Perrier Group president Ronald V. Davis said in a
statement.
   Lazgin said all Perrier bottled after July 29 would bear the new
label, which will say, ``Natural mineral water.''
   A side panel will also state: ``Since 1863, bottled only at
Source Perrier, Vergeze, France. The carbonation used in Perrier is
taken from a naturally occurring source found deep within the
earth.''
   Source Perrier SA of France began a worldwide recall in February
after trace amounts of benzene were discovered in some bottles.
   Perrier said the water became contaminated because workers had
failed to replace filters that remove impurities from the carbon
dioxide gas. It said small amounts of elements such as benzene are
found in all naturally occurring gases.
   Perrier said no one's health was ever at risk because of the
benzene. But the incident revealed that Perrier, which touted its
product as pure and natural, mechanically adds gas to the water and
filters out impurities.
   The company has announced new testing and monitoring procedures
to prevent future problems.
   Lazgin said bottles would return to the shelf April 26,
beginning in New York, Miami and Washington. All bottles since the
recall will bear the words, ``Nouvelle Production.''
   She said surveys of Perrier customers conducted shortly after
the recall indicated 84 percent would buy it again.

   Assets of the nation's 508 money market mutual
funds fell $1.25 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $388.60 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $685.5 million decrease in fund assets the
previous week. The Washington-based mutual fund trade group
originally had reported the previous week decline as $667.6 million
but subsequently revised it.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 240
general purpose funds fell $467.3 million to $133.05 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $237.3 million to
$165.32 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds fell $1.02
billion to $90.23 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday remained unchanged at 7.69 percent, said
Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in Holliston,
Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, down from 45 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.24 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.25 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.05 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.91
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from a week
earlier. Yields were 8.03 percent on 1-year CDs, down from 8.04
percent; 8.06 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.07 percent; and
8.11 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines's striking Machinists, victorious
in their quest to outlast company boss Frank Lorenzo, looked ahead
Thursday to negotiating a back-to-work pact that could include deep
concessions.
   ``There obviously is going to be tremendous sacrifices over the
next year, maybe two years or more, to bring us back to normalcy
... but it's not going to be done in the interest of Frank
Lorenzo,'' Eastern Machinist president Charles Bryan told about 100
strikers gathered at union headquarters near Miami International
Airport.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., was
ousted from control of Eastern late Wednesday in Manhattan by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who named former airline executive
Martin Shugrue as special trustee of the Miami-based carrier.
   Appointment of a trustee had been a major goal for striking
workers, who contend Lorenzo has funneled valuable Eastern assets
to non-union sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Lifland made the appointment after Eastern's unsecured
creditors, who are owed $980 million, argued that present
management was unable to bring the company out of its financial
tailspin.
   Eastern officials said Thursday they will not appeal the
appointment and lauded Lifland's indications that the airline can
be reorganized rather than liquidated.
   Eastern spokesman Bob Hunter said the court's decision to
release $80 million from Eastern's escrow account will keep the
carrier in operation through mid-1990.
   ``It's still business as usual,'' said Hunter.
   But problems remain. Eastern lost $852.3 million last year, and
creditors say the company has failed to regain the confidence of
consumers and travel agents since the strike.
   Several top Eastern executives told the bankruptcy court that
appointment of a trustee could hurt business further and cause
employee departures.
   Furthermore, the company still must reach long-term contract
agreements with its unions.
   Nevertheless, Shugrue issued a statement projecting optimism
about Eastern's future.
   ``I want to reassure the community of travel agents and the
flying public that Eastern is flying, that it is flying safely and
reliably, and with an unparalleled level of service and
enthusiasm,'' he said.
   The Machinists are seeking talks as soon as possible, but
returning members to the hangars and runways could take some time,
said union leaders.
   ``Our main goal now is getting back to work,'' said Frank Ortis,
president of the Machinists' Miami local. ``But we will remain on
strike until an agreement is reached. We've worked to hard to make
any moves now that we'd regret later.''
   Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions went
on strike March 4, 1989, following lengthy, bitter contract
negotiations. The strike forced the company to seek bankruptcy
court protection from creditors five days later.
   Of the 9,000 Machinists who walked off the job, about 7,500 have
indicated a desire to return to Eastern, said Ortis. About 2,500
workers could be brought back immediately following a strike
settlement, he said.
   Flight attendants and pilots ended their strikes in November,
but few have returned to Eastern because of limited openings. The
company has shrunk its operations since the strike and hired
replacement workers to fill many positions.
   Many of the strikers said they would accept some wage and
benefit cuts in order to get back on the job.
   ``If it was up to me, I'd be back to work today,'' said Willie
Washington, 47, who has worked as a part-time substitute teacher
during the strike. ``The goal of this strike was to get rid of
Lorenzo and go back to work. Well, we're almost finished.''
   Inside union headquarters, many anti-Lorenzo relics remain:
cartoons depicting him as a sinister union-buster and bumper
stickers with a red stripe across Lorenzo's name.
   But a bulletin board once covered with newspaper clips o the
strike was stripped clean. A sign on top read: ``After Lorenzo.''
   ``We are not in a position now to say that everything's over. We
have a long and a very complicated road ahead of us, but certainly
this is a giant step _ an enormous step _ to get us to our goal of
bringing Eastern Airlines back to pre-eminence in the airline
industry,'' Bryan said.
   Bryan declined to make direct comments concerning Shugrue, but
said Shugrue's experience in aviation was encouraging.
   Shugrue, a pilot, worked as a Pan Am Corp. executive before
becoming president of Houston-based Continental. Shugrue left
Continental under pressure from Lorenzo a month before the Eastern
strike.
   Shugrue was a consultant to former major league baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth in a union-supported effort to acquire
Eastern last year.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures prices staged a dramatic
rebound Thursday, spiking higher following news that OPEC has
called a special emergency session to review deteriorating oil
prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for May
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, jumped $1.10 per 42-gallon barrel to settle at $18.06.
On Wednesday the contract traded as low as $16.60 a barrel, its
worst level since December 1988.
   Because the May contract expires Friday, it typically is more
volatile. Other contract months showed smaller gains. June crude
gained 78 cents a barrel while July rose 67 cents.
   Prices rallied immediately after word spread that a special
session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
eight-member monitoring panel would meet on May 2 in Geneva.
   Traders scrambled to cover short positions, and volume was heavy
throughout the session.
   The market ``is anticipating there will be cutbacks'' in OPEC
overproduction, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Inc.
   Analysts estimated the 13-nation cartel was pumping more than 24
million barrels of crude a day, well over its ceiling of 22.1
million barrels a day for the first half of the year.
   Analysts say Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have
persistently exceeded their OPEC supply quotas and are believed to
be producing most of the cartel's excess crude.
   Traders are hoping that OPEC members will agree to stop
overproducing so that prices will stabilize.
   ``It always makes the market nervous when there's any sort of
meeting coming up,'' said John O'Connell, senior energy analyst at
Refco Inc. ``If (OPEC) called a meeting, they must be concerned.''
   Refined petroleum products traded on the Merc also rose after
finishing mixed on Wednsday.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline jumped 2.23
cents to settle at 61.78 cents a gallon after losing 0.89 cent on
Wednesday. Other contract months posted similar gains.
   Home-heating oil for May delivery dropped rose 0.11 cent to
52.80 a gallon after losing 1.51 cents on Wednesday. But other
contract months showed far stronger gains. June heating oil surged
1.24 cents a gallon while July was up 1.45 cents.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery settled at $1.570 per
million British thermal units, off from $1.583 on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson To Buy Marshall Field's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minneapolis retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. on
Thursday added a new jewel to its department store crown,
announcing it has reached agreement to buy Marshall Field &amp; Co. for
about $1.04 billion.
   ``We view this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Dayton
Hudson chairman Kenneth Macke said in announcing the agreement to
purchase Field's from BAT Industries PLC, a British conglomerate.
``This is a great strategic fit for us.''
   At a Chicago news conference, Macke said his company expects to
complete the deal for Field's, which operates 24 stores in
Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas, within the next two months.
   He said Dayton Hudson had no immediate plans to close any
Field's stores or make dramatic changes in Field's strategy, and
reiterated a commitment to the ongoing renovation of Field's
flagship store in Chicago's Loop.
   The acquisition will be financed with a combination of
internally generated funds and a mix of debt instruments, the
retailer said. Dayton Hudson does not plan an equity offering.
   ``We will have absolutely no problem financing the deal,'' said
Macke, who added that junk bonds would play no role in the purchase.
   Thursday's announcement capped a buyout effort by a number of
groups, including current Marshall Field chairman and chief
executive officer Philip Miller and a Field's management team.
   Miller, who is widely credited with helping turn Field's around
in the past five years, said he was disappointed by the news but
was taking a wait-and-see attitude before announcing any plans.
   ``We don't have any indication as to what Dayton-Hudson's plans
are,'' Miller said in a telephone interview. ``Until we understand
that, we're encouraging all our people to keep their powder dry.''
   Miller said he believed until Thursday that his group was the
front runner in the bidding for Field's.
   ``It's always a surprise when you lose,'' he added.
   A BAT executive said there was nothing wrong with the Field's
management bid, but Dayton Hudson's was better.
   ``The fact is that the Dayton Hudson bid was clearly superior in
financial terms,'' said Arthur Martinez, a senior vice president of
Batus Inc., BAT's U.S. subsidiary. ``Simply put, it was higher. In
other dimensions, it was a simpler proposal for us to deal with.''
   While saying it was too early to discuss management changes,
Macke and Dayton Hudson President Stephen Watson said they planned
to meet with Miller soon.
   ``Phil Miller and his team have done an extraordinary job ... of
building this company,'' Watson said.
   Others said to be bidding for Field's were May Department Stores
Co., based in St. Louis, and Dillard Department Stores Inc., based
in Little Rock, Ark.
   Analyst Marcia Raley, of Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis, said
the purchase would appear to be a good deal for Dayton Hudson.
   ``The fit is exceptionally good,'' she said.
   ``I think it's a very, very strong strategic bid for them,'' she
said, adding the acquisition price appeared to fair.
   ``There's been a lot of distressed merchandise that has been on
the market,'' she said. ``But Marshall Field is not a distressed
operation _ it's a very high quality operation.''
   Marshall Field's, one of the country's best known department
store groups, was put up for sale last year by BAT as part of a
restructuring to defend itself against a hostile takeover bid by
Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT, a large conglomerate with interests ranging from tobacco to
financial services and retailing, also is selling its Saks Fifth
Avenue division.
   Dayton Hudson's department store division operates 37 stores
known as either Dayton's or Hudson's in their respective markets in
seven Midwestern states.
   Dayton Hudson also owns the Target chain, one of the country's
biggest discounters with 408 stores in 32 states, and Mervyn's, a
moderate-price department store company with 221 stores in 15
states.
   In 1989, revenues for its department store division, which
employs more than 22,000 people, were $1.8 billion, and its
operating profit was $179 million.

   The stock market recorded its second straight
loss Thursday, beset by persistent worries about rising interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 20.94 to 2,711.94,
extending its drop over the last two sessions to 53.83 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
511 up, 968 down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.93 million
shares, against 147.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 184.95 million shares.
   Analysts said sentiment among traders was dominated by a recent
rise in interest rates and signs of stubborn inflationary pressures.
   Interest rates, up sharply Tuesday and Wednesday, climbed
further in credit-market activity Thursday. Prices of long-term
government bonds slipped about $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields in the 8.84 percent-8.91 percent range.
   Brokers also said investors were giving mixed reviews to
corporate earnings reports for the first quarter.
   While a few companies have chalked up better-than-expected
showings, analysts say the positive surprises haven't been
consistent enough to bolster confidence in the market as a whole.
   In addition, observers say the latest rise in interest rates has
clouded hopes for an improved profit performance later in the year.
   Digital Equipment rose 2&lsqb; to 82&lsqb; in active trading. The company
posted a big drop in quarterly profits, but many Wall Streeters had
been expecting the news to be even worse.
   American Express, which reported a $619.80 million loss for the
first quarter, fell 1\ to 27|.
   Other losers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, down } at 109&lsqb;; Philip Morris, down ~ at 41};
Coca-Cola, down 1~ at 77&rsqb;, and General Electric, down } at 65}.
   Comdisco tumbled 8{ to 18, suffering the day's biggest
percentage setback, as the company projected a substantial decline
in its quarterly profits.
   Reebok International lost 1{ to 17{ on the company's report of a
quarterly earnings gain that fell short of estimates.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the most active Big Board issue,
jumped 1 to 4\ on takeover rumors and speculation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $23.73 billion, or 0.73
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.36 to 185.57.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.07 to 392.74, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.63 at 338.09.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.52 to 429.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 350.73, down 2.49.

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Shareholders Approve Recapitalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Gulf Corp. shareholders on Thursday
approved a recapitalization of the company, a move management
proposed three months ago to ward off a takeover bid by Texas
investor Harold Simmons.
   The company did not release the vote totals, but said if
financing is completed as expected the recapitalization will take
effect April 27.
   Simmons, who owns about 10 percent of the chemical maker's
stock, said earlier this month he was abandoning his $1.1 billion
tender offer for Georgia Gulf and instead would support the
proposed recapitalization.
   Under the approved plan, each holder of a share of Georgia Gulf
stock will receive $30 in cash, one share of a new issue of common
stock and $8.50 a share in notes.
   Stockholders also were given the option of trading their common
stock at the rate of one share for 5.5 shares of new common stock.
   The original recapitalization plan called for $38 in cash but
there was doubt expressed that the company could sell the necessary
junk bonds to finance that offer.
   Analysts previously have had mixed reactions to the move, noting
that it would put the company heavily in debt. Simmons, through his
company NL Industries, is expected to realize about $15 million in
profits from the recapitalization.
   Meanwhile Thursday, Georgia Gulf announced its first quarter
earnings declined 33 percent from the same period in 1989.
   Net income for the quarter was $37.4 million or $1.52 a share,
down from $55.4 million or $2.12 a share during the same three
months last year. Net sales also fell to $251.6 million from $317.8
million.
   Jerry R. Satrum, Georgia Gulf's president and chief operating
officer, said the decline was ``substantial,'' and said it was
partly a result of having to compare earnings to record levels
achieved a year ago.
   ``During 1989, and in particular the first two quarters of that
year, business conditions were robust and pricing reflected spot
shortages for most products we manufacture,'' Satrum said.
   ``Despite the fact that we were unable to maintain this
momentum, we are pleased with the company's progress so far this
year given the obvious slowdown in the general economy,'' he said.

<HEAD>SEC Eases Rules on Trading Privately Placed Securities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission made it
easier Thursday for big institutional investors to trade privately
in unregistered stocks and bonds, a move expected to help lower the
cost of raising money for U.S. companies.
   The new rule helps cut costs partly by easing disclosure
requirements for companies making so-called private placements.
   It also is seen as making the market for such securities more
liquid by clearly defining who may buy and sell them. That
eliminates an uncertainty that made them unattractive to large
investors and forced many issuers to sell the securities at a
discount.
   The rule change also is an attempt to woo foreign corporations _
previously put off by onerous U.S. disclosure requirements _ to
raise capital here.
   The SEC requires companies offering stock to the public to
register and make extensive disclosures about ownership, financing
and other issues, to protect investors.
   But the SEC eased restrictions on trading of privately offered
securities, which aren't required to register and aren't bound by
U.S. disclosure regulations.
   Only large institutional investors like banks, pension funds and
insurance companies that already hold $100 million in securities
can qualify for the new private placement restrictions, with
certain exceptions.
   The SEC, which has one vacancy, approved the measure 4-0.
   The rule, Rule 144a, set a high threshold for participating in
the private placement market to screen out unsophisticated
investors who are more in need of such disclosures provided by SEC
regulation of public offerings.
   The SEC also approved rule changes that would make the National
Association of Securities Dealers' PORTAL trading system the market
place for such unregistered securities and would clarify
regulations governing foreign transactions of unregistered
securities.
   ``These rules will have a profound and beneficial effect upon
the ability of issuers to raise capital in the context of today's
global marketplace, and will enhance the competitiveness and
efficiency of our domestic markets,'' said SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, who has been pushing to make the U.S. securities laws and
markets more competitive with foreign markets.
   ``The result should be a lower cost of capital in our markets,''
Breeden said at the beginning of the three-hour meeting before a
standing room only crowd of more than 200.
   Linda C. Quinn, head of the SEC's Corporation Finance Division,
said the rule change would make it easier to sell privately placed,
unregistered securities.
   ``It says that if you have a security that hasn't been
registered and you want to resell it without any conditions, you
can do it as long as you resell it to the right person and that's
the ($100 million institutional investor) requirement,'' she said.
``Currently the law is unclear as to when you can resell it.''
   Exceptions to the $100 million requirement are banks and savings
and loans, which must have net worth of $25 million in addition to
the $100 million securities holding; and registered broker-dealers
that either own and manage $10 million in securities, or act as
riskless principles for qualified institutional buyers.
   The rule changes will not affect small investors unless they
have money in a big pension fund or mutual fund that invests in
privately-offered securities.
   Breeden said that according to some reports, the market for
privately placed securities has grown from $15.8 billion in 1980 to
$170.4 billion last year.
   ``We hope this rule will have a beneficial effect even on people
who don't buy securities at all,'' Breeden told reporters after the
meeting. ``To the extent that we can reduce the cost of U.S.
companies raising capital, that'll benefit the people who work for
those companies, benefit the U.S. economy broadly by helping make
us more competitive.''

<HEAD>Oil Rebounds On OPEC News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rebounded strongly Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on news that OPEC had called an emergency
meeting to discuss the recent plunge in oil prices.
   On other commodity markets Thursday, grain and soybean futures
rose; livestock and meat were mostly higher; and precious metals
were mixed.
   Some energy analysts regarded the OPEC announcement as a ploy to
keep prices from falling further in hopes that a seasonal rise in
gasoline demand will sop up the crude oil surplus, eliminating the
need for a cut in OPEC production quotas.
   ``Basically, this is a little bit of a stability conspiracy,''
said Peter Beutel, the head of energy trading for Elders Futures
Inc.
   Nonetheless, West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents
to $1.10 higher with the contract for delivery in May up $1.10 at
$18.06 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent to 1.45 cents higher with
May at 52.80 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.35 cent to
2.23 cents higher with May at 61.78 cents a gallon.
   All 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will attend a May 2 special meeting of OPEC's
price-monitoring committee, the cartel's acting president, Sadek
Boussena, said Thursday.
   He said the meeting was called to discuss the recent drop in
crude oil prices to 16-month lows, a decline that market analysts
have blamed on OPEC overproduction during a period of weak seasonal
demand.
   The OPEC members probably could firm up the oil market quickly
by cutting their own production quotas but some analysts said the
cartel is unlikely to do so. They said OPEC is more likely to hold
out the possibility of quota cuts while it waits for the seasonal
increase in gasoline production to eliminate the crude oil surplus.
   That increase has already begun, analysts said, citing Tuesday's
American Petroleum Institute inventory survey, which showed only a
slight rise in U.S. crude oil stocks and a dramatic increase in
U.S. refinery activity.
   The 3.3 percent rise in refinery runs indicated most refiners
have completed their springtime ``turnarounds,'' when they shut
down to retool for more gasoline and less heating oil production.
   By June 25, the rescheduled date of OPEC's mid-year conference,
the current crude oil glut may have been reduced to the point where
OPEC no longer needs to consider cutting quotas, Beutel said.
   In the meantime, he said, OPEC members may continue to hint at
quota cuts just to keep prices from falling.
   Tom Bentz, director of trading for United Energy Inc., agreed:
``It's basically a ploy to stabilize the market a little longer
until they can make it to June.''
   Grain and soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board
of Trade, boosted by a late flurry of buying linked in part to
delays in the South American soybean harvest.
   Rainy weather and sweeping economic reforms have slowed the
movement of soybeans and soybean meal from Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, analysts said.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 3} cents higher with May at
$3.69 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 3} cents higher with May at
$2.77 a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent higher with May at
$1.57} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 6{ cents higher with May
at $6.00{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
while pork futures rose sharply, paced by limit gains in the pork
belly market amid stronger cash markets and bullish chart signals.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher with April at
79.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with April at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
to .75 cent higher with April at 57.47 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .85 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with May at 61.42
cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended $1 to $1.20
higher with April at $377.30 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to
0.3 cent lower with May at $5.078 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Bear Stearns Profits Fall In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns &amp; Co. said Thursday that profit in
its third quarter fell 16 percent and revenue declined 5.8 percent
in another indication of Wall Street's recession.
   The brokerage reported net income of $34.6 million, or 34 cents
a share, for the three months ended March 30, compared with $41.1
million, or 39 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue fell to $588 million in its third fiscal quarter from
$624 million a year earlier. Bear Stearns' fiscal year does not
correspond to the calendar year.
   ``We are very pleased with the results for the third quarter as
we continue to be operating in a very difficult market
environment,'' Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C.
Greenberg said in a statement.
   Firms across Wall Street still are having trouble rebounding
from the 1987 stock market crash. Business in key areas such as
stock and bond underwriting, investment banking and retail
brokerage activity all are down.
   In addition, the first three months of 1990 have been worse than
figures released by the firms appear because the comparable 1989
period was particularly weak.
   For the nine-month period, Bear Stearns said net income was
$85.9 million, or 82 cents a share, down 32 percent from $125
million, or $1.16 a share, in the same year-ago period.
   Revenue for Bear Stearns' first three quarters was $1.75
billion, up slightly from $1.74 billion for the comparable period a
year earlier.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended April 9, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,275.8 billion from $3,269.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,076.5 billion from $4,063.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $805.6 billion from $808 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.0 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,255.5 billion, a 6.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,062.4 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1
rose 4.8 percent to an average of $801.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $429 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $296 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$116 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $576
million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, down from the previous
two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $304.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $302.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed Thursday in domestic
foreign exchange trading, losing ground against a revived Japanese
yen but rising against most other major currencies.
   Gold prices moved higher.
   Analysts said rumors in the markets that the Japanese were about
to push their interest rates higher _ placing the yen in a better
position to compete with the dollar _ put pressure on the U.S.
currency.
   Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc.,
said the dollar has not performed as well as might have been
expected in recent days, given an improvement in the U.S. trade
deficit and an increase in market interest rates in the United
States this week.
   Barbanel said exchange rates may be stabilizing, or foreign
currencies may be enjoying a technical bounce after the dollar's
recent rise.
   Overseas dealers said the yen's modest recovery after weeks of
declines was a result of a range of events, notably a rebound on
the Tokyo stock exchange and reported comments from U.S. Treasury
officials that they viewed the dollar as too strong.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from the
Wednesday close. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 156.40
yen. In New York the dollar fell sharply to 157.25 yen from 158.125
late Wednesday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6448, up from $1.6347 late
Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.6450, up from $1.6400.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6787 West German marks, up from
1.6720; 1.4847 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785; 5.6425 French francs,
up from 5.6200; 1,233.50 Italian lire, up from 1,228.25; and
1.16225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16135.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.6755 West German marks, up from 1.6720; 1.4815 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4876; 5.6325 French francs, up from 5.6315; 1.8820 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8855; 1,231.25 Italian lire, up from
1,230.50; 1.1618 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640.
   Gold rose $1.20 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, closing at $377.20, and was later quoted at a bid $377 by
Republic National Bank of New York, up 70 cents from late Wednesday.
   Gold traded in London late Thursday at $376.55 a troy ounce, up
from $375.00 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fetched $376.25 vs.
$375.50 late Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.93 to close at $377.80.
   Silver rose 0.2 cent on the Commodity Exchange, closing at

<TEXT>
   Outside the windows of the federal bankruptcy
courthouse, the fading sun reddened the sky over New York harbor.
   Inside, the sun was setting on Frank Lorenzo's reign over
Eastern Airlines.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern, had
remained uncharacteristically quiet through most of the four-day
hearing over a request by creditors to put an outside trustee in
charge of the airline. Now, at around 7:20 p.m. Wednesday, all the
witnesses had been heard and Shapiro let loose.
   ``The issue in this case is $1.2 billion in losses within a
year,'' thundered Shapiro, a bear of a man known as a tough
mediator. ``Can Mr. Lorenzo now be allowed to wipe out the
creditors' interest? ... Can anyone blame the creditors for being
outraged?''
   The 100 or so people packed into the small courtroom of U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland hung on every word. Attorneys
for Eastern's unions, which shut down the airline in March 1989,
had been dreaming of such a moment for more than a year.
   From the outset, the unions had demanded that a special trustee
be appointed to take control of Eastern from Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. But they had gained a powerful new
ally in recent weeks. The committee of Eastern's unsecured
creditors, exasperated by the airline's staggering losses and plans
to slash debt payments, had asked Lifland to appoint a trustee.
   Attorneys for Eastern and Texas Air, their table littered with
documents, pens and bottles of mineral water, had called a stream
of witnesses to fight the creditors' motion.
   After Shapiro, lawyers for the creditors and for Eastern would
be speaking. Then it would be Lifland's turn.
   The Staten Island ferry plied across the harbor as the red sky
turned to indigo and lights flickered. It was 7:45.
   Shapiro homed in more closely on the man at the center of the
courtroom drama, the man who insists he is an airline builder while
labor calls him a union-buster.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo only starts negotiating at the very last minute,''
the Washington attorney said. ``He's just a tough guy to make a
deal with.''
   Lorenzo didn't hear Shapiro's closing statement. He had left the
courthouse earlier after testifying as the final witness of the
hearing.
   Indeed, Lorenzo seemed to be doing some negotiating from the
witness box in his last few hours as Eastern's chief. He offered a
new reorganization proposal that would give the unsecured creditors
about 30 cents for every dollar owed, up from a previous offer of
about 27{ cents that creditors had rejected.
   Lorenzo, the son of Spanish immigrants and the head of an
airline empire, raised his right hand and was sworn in by the court
reporter just before 6 p.m. He was questioned first by Robert Sisk,
an attorney for Texas Air, who asked him about his history, his
relationship with Eastern President Phil Bakes and the links
between Eastern and its parent.
   Lorenzo, wearing a conservative navy suit, blue shirt and
reddish tie, looked tired as he answered Sisk's questions. About 15
minutes into his testimony, he carefully poured a glass of water
from the aluminum pitcher in the witness box. Ten minutes later, he
arched his back and leaned his head back almost horizontally in his
chair. Later, he stretched out his right arm and drummed his
fingers on the wood of the box a few times.
   At around 6:40, he put his hands together in a prayer-like
position tucked under his chin.
   ``We're pretty proud of our track record,'' he told the court,
noting how he had successfully taken Eastern's sister Continental
Airlines out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   After a brief cross-examination by creditors' attorney Joel
Zweibel and some pointed questions from Lifland, Lorenzo stepped
down.
   After four days of agonizingly slow hearings, time started
telescoping _ like the last bit of sand running through an
hourglass. After a recess, it was time for Shapiro's statement,
followed by summations by Zweibel and Bruce Zirinsky, the lead
attorney for Eastern.
   The union lawyers remained silent.
   Interrupting the speakers from time to time, Lifland started
giving increasingly strong indications that he might take the
radical step of appointing a trustee. He referred to Lorenzo's
``wheel of power'' and the strong relationship between Texas Air
and Eastern, lashing out at Zirinsky's attempts to demarcate the
two.
   As the harbor sky turned from indigo to jet-black, Lifland
declared one last recess, for an hour. When court reconvened, he
said, he would render his opinion.
   As they ran out of the courthouse for a quick dinner, some
skeptical union lawyers still weren't convinced that Lifland would
opt for a trustee. They were afraid that Lorenzo, the consummate
dealmaker, might still pull a last-minute agreement with the
creditors out of his hat.
   ``It's this hour that makes me nervous,'' confided Bruce Simon,
an attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   The courtroom filled up again at around 9:15 as people waited
for Lifland to emerge from his chambers with a written opinion in
his hand.
   At around 10, Lifland appeared. ``The air conditioning must be
off,'' he noted as he sat down at the bench. The chief judge of the
U.S. Bankuptcy Court for the Southern District of New York started
reading, citing a litany of legal cases.
   ``The flying public's interest must at all times be taken into
account,'' he said. ``It's time to change the captain of Eastern's
crew.''
   Frank Lorenzo had been thrown out of the cockpit.

   Manufacturers on Thursday recalled more than
600,000 infant pillows and cushions linked to the suffocation
deaths of 19 children. The government said parents should stop
using any similar pillows.
   One firm whose pillows were involved with ``more than several
deaths'' was resisting the recall and could face legal action, said
an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   But a spokesman for the company, Comfort Products of Dallas,
said that the firm's president would meet with CPSC officials
Friday and that an agreement was expected.
   ``Today we are announcing that nine of the 10 firms that made
these cushions have agreed to recall their products from the
public,'' said Jacqueline Jones-Smith, chairwoman of the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   ``Regardless of who made the product ... we urge consumers to
please, please, please stop using it immediately,'' added David
Schmeltzer, head of the CPSC's compliance division. He said the
recall could eventually include nearly a million pillows.
   Nineteen children 3 months or younger have been ``found dead,
lying stomach-down'' on the cushions since September 1987, said
Jones-Smith. Three of the deaths occurred in January and February
of this year. Ten deaths occurred last year.
   Using a doll, Schmeltzer demonstrated how the soft, pliable
pillows conform to shape and could engulf a child placed faced down
on them. Because infants often are unable to roll over by
themselves, they can suffocate when placed in that position on the
cushions.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who has been critical of the
commission, said, ``This action should have taken place months
ago.''
   D'Amato last month criticized the CPSC for having ``an entirely
too casual attitude'' about taking legal action against the pillow
manufacturers.
   The commission issued a warning March 6 urging parents to
discontinue use of the pillows, but it did not move to ban the
pillows because such actions can take longer than a voluntary
recall, said spokesman Dan Rumelt.
   The commission said negotiations had included all makers of an
estimated 950,000 pillows produced since 1985.
   The recall involves 627,825 small pillows or cushions filled
with plastic foam beads marketed by six manufacturers who the
commission said would begin their recalls on Thursday.
   Three additional producers have agreed ``in principle'' with the
recall and details on their response would be made available in the
next few days, the CPSC said.
   As for the company that has resisted the recall, Schmeltzer
said, ``If agreement by that company is not reached shortly the
staff will recommend to the commission appropriate legal action to
try and rectify the situation.''
   ``We believe there have been more than several deaths that have
been involved with that company's product,'' he added.
   Schmeltzer said the firm has not notified its distributors but
has stopped manufacturing its product.
   The CPSC said it was prohibited from identifying the company.
However, private consumer advocate David Snow, who met this week
with CPSC officials, said it was Comfort Products of Dallas.
   Patty Lifsey Lakstigala of San Diego, whose 2-month-old son
Kailan was found lying face down on a ``Comfort Tote'' cushion on
Feb. 24, also said she had learned the company would not be
participating in the recall.
   The spokesman for Comfort Products, Jan Hamill, said from Dallas
that the firm president, Margaret Alivizatos, was in Washington to
meet with commission officials to ``discuss a plan to meet the
commission's concerns about the Comfort Tote.''
   The company, in a statement attributed to Alivizatos, said, ``We
anticipate that our company and the commission will reach agreement
on this plan promptly and tat it will be implemented as quickly as
possible.''
   Eight of the 19 reported deaths occurred in Texas. Of the other
deaths, there were two each in Florida, Oklahoma and one each in
Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina
and Virginia.
   Two retailers, J.C. Penney Co., Inc. and the Army and Air Force
Exchange Service, which sold one brand of the cushions worldwide at
post and base exchanges, have joined the recall effort. However,
the commission said none of the reported deaths involved cushions
sold by those retailers.
   The recall includes:
   _467,000 ``Mothers Helper'' cushions made by Hollander Home
Fashions in Newark, N.J. Hollander said last month it had recalled
its cushions in January.
   _110,000 ``Gold Bug Support Sacks'' made by Gold, Inc. of Denver.
   _35,700 ``Cozy Cushions'' made by Pinky Baby Products of Houston.
   _12,000 ``Cozy Baby'' pillows manufactured by Cozy Baby Products
of Mount Vernon, N.Y.
   _3,000 ``Baby Minder'' cushions made by The Fourth Little Pig of
San Anselmo, Calif.
   _125 ``Baby Sak'' pillows made by Baby Sak of Pembroke Pines,
Fla.
   Consumers should contact the manufacturers or retailers for
details on how to return or exchange the pillows for a refund or
other products, officials said.
   Additionally, the commission said consumers who know of deaths
they suspect may be connected with infant pillows should call the
CPSC hotline at 1-800-638-2772.

   Crude oil futures rose sharply Thursday
after OPEC ministers agreed to hold an emergency meeting on May 2
to try to brake the recent price slide that pushed crude to its
lowest levels in 16 months.
   Prices rallied immediately after word spread that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had decided to call a
special session of its eight-member monitoring panel.
   Sadek Boussena of Algeria, the cartel's acting president, said
an urgent meeting was necessary ``given the persistence of the
deterioration registered on the international oil market.''
   ``This meeting will examine the measures needed to halt the
constant degradation of the market and to raise prices so as to
re-establish them at the level set by OPEC,'' Boussena said in a
statement released by Algerian officials in London.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, jumped $1.10 per 42-gallon barrel to settle at $18.06 on the
New York Mercantile Exchnage. Other contracts also gained.
   ``The market has decided to take it very bullishly,'' Nick
Antill, analyst at the London-based investment firm of County
NatWest, said of OPEC's announcement.
   The crude had been trading in the range of $20 to $21 a barrel
early in April. It plummeted nearly 90 cents in the two previous
sessions, finishing at its lowest since December 1988.
   Prices have been pummeled on reports that OPEC was exceeding its
own output limits at a time of seasonal declines in demand by oil
consuming nations.
   The average price of seven crudes used as the cartel's reference
plummeted to $15.38 a barrel last week, compared with $17.12 a
barrel in the first week of April and well below OPEC's target
price of $18 a barrel.
   Boussena, who is Algeria's mines minister, said all 13 OPEC
members would attend the special session, although it technically
was a meeting of the cartel's eight-member price monitoring
committee.
   OPEC's mid-year conference, previously scheduled for May 25, has
been postponed until June 25 to give time for the market to move to
a ``better balance between supply and demand,'' he said.
   Analysts estimated the cartel was pumping more than 24 million
barrels of crude a day, well over its ceiling of 22.1 million
barrels a day for the first half of the year.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which persistently have
cheated on their OPEC supply quotas, have been blamed for producing
most of the cartel's excess crude.
   On Tuesday, the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates met in Saudi Arabia and called on all members
to abide by their production quotas.
   But the markets reacted skeptically to the ministers' statement
and prices continued sliding.
   Antill said that if the emergency session had not been
scheduled, ``things looked bleak.'' But now, he said, ``there's
potential for some sort of upside'' movement of prices earlier than
expected.
   Lucy Mullins, analyst at London's Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said
the ministers' decision to call the meeting ``indicated they are
very severely concerned'' about the fall in prices.
   She said it indicated that they intend ``to take positive moves
to shore up oil prices.''
   Analysts had been predicting prices would weaken in the
April-June period when warmer temperatures reduce oil demand in the
United States and other consuming nations. But they were surprised
by the sudden plunge that began last week.
   Prices were expected to strengthen in June when demand for
gasoline picks up at the start of the summer driving season.

<HEAD>Profit Falls 53 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. said Thursday its net
income fell 53 percent in the first quarter because of weaker
chemical prices and extreme cold at the end of the year that shut
down some southern facilities.
   The chemicals and plastics company reported it earned $94
million, or 66 cents per share, in the quarter ending March 31,
down from $201 million, or $1.44 a share, a year ago.
   The company had sales of $2.17 billion, down 3 percent from
$2.24 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
   Union Carbide attributed the decline to weaker chemical volumes
and prices, as well as shutdowns and maintenance because of the
extreme cold that struck the nation late last year and early
January.
   The cold affected Union Carbide's chemical plants in Texas City
and Seadrift, Texas, and Taft, La., said company spokesman David N.
Kernis.
   The company said the earnings do not include recently announced
sales of chemical businesses by Union Carbide's chemical and
plastics subsidiary.
   Union Carbide reported $1.28 billion in sales from its chemicals
and plastics businesses, down 15 percent from the first quarter of
1989. Sales from its industrial gases division were up 32 percent,
to $718 million.
   Sales from its carbon products unit fell 10 percent to $175
million.

<HEAD>Moody's Puts Citicorp Ratings Under Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody's Investors Service on Thursday placed its
ratings on Citicorp short-term and long-term debt under review for
possible downgrade because of problems involving the bank's real
estate and Third World loans.
   The credit rating agency also said it was reviewing some ratings
of Citicorp subsidiaries including Citibank NA.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, on Tuesday
reported that first-quarter earnings declined 56 percent
predominantly because of problems associated with loans associated
with a declining real estate market.
   The move by Moody's affects $31 billion in credit held by the
parent company and $7 billion by subsidiaries.
   Moody's said the review will focus ``on the risks associated
with Citicorp's high asset concentrations,'' particularly
commercial real estate, highly leveraged transactions and Third
World loans.
   Citicorp is the nation's largest lender for real estate. Some
developers in regions of the country have been unable to repay
loans to many banks because of a glut of new buildings that has
caused prices to fall.
   ``The review also will include an assessment of Citicorp's
capital adequacy when adjusted for these risks, as well as an
evaluation of the outlook for the firm's core profitability,''
Moody's said in a statement.
   Citicorp in the first quarter charged off $135 million of
commercial loans in developing countries, including $56 million of
real estate loans, mostly in North America. Also, Citicorp charged
off about $40 million of loans to finance corporate takeovers or
other heavily indebted borrowers.
   In its statement, Moody's also said it would ``considser
Citicorp's strengths, which include an attractive and profitable
consumer franchise and significant diversity in its business.''
   A credit downgrade could increase substantially the cost of
borrowing for Citicorp and its subsidiaries.

<HEAD>McDonald's Profit Up 12 Percent; Plans Switch To Low-Fat Dairy
Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. on Thursday
reported a 12 percent increase in its first-quarter profit and
announced plans to switch from ice cream drinks and desserts to
low-fat dairy foods and fruit sorbet.
   The company recently was criticized publicly by a Nebraska
millionaire who placed national newspaper ads saying McDonald's
foods are too fatty.
   McDonald's reported net income of $158.1 million, or 43 cents
per share, for the three months ending March 31, compared with
$141.7 million, or 38 cents per share, for the same period a year
ago.
   First quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $1.5 billion from $1.4
billion, McDonald's said in a statement from its headquarters in
the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook.
   Systemwide sales, including sales at franchised outlets as well
as company-owned stores, climbed 9 percent to $4.3 billion from
$3.9 billion.
   Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement the company's
business remained strong despite intense competition and a slower
U.S. economy.
   Responding personally for the first time to the recent attack on
the fat content of McDonald's foods, Quinlan said McDonald's offers
``high-quality and wholesome food, which fits comfortably into a
well-balanced diet.''
   He said McDonald's would make the switch to low-fat milk shakes,
low-fat frozen yogurt and orange sorbet ice by May 15. The chain
already has added no-fat, no-cholesterol apple bran muffins and
cereals to its breakfast menu, Quinlan said.
   ``The low-fat milk shakes contain significantly less fat than
the current milk shakes, but retain the same great taste,'' Quinlan
said.
   Earlier this month, Nebraska millionaire Phil Sokolof bought
full-page ads in major U.S. newspapers saying McDonald's foods are
too fatty. He called on the restaurant chain to cut the fat content
of its hamburger meat by 10 percent.
   McDonald's first responded that it was experimenting with using
vegetable shortening instead of lard for frying its french fries
and hash browns.
   The company then went on the attack itself by sending letters to
newspapers advising them that Sokolof's ad was inaccurate and
warning them not to print it again.
   McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said Thursday McDonald's had
been planning the switch to low-fat dairy products since last fall.
   He said the company chose to announce the change at this time to
combat public perceptions that may have been created by Sokolof's
campaign.
   Ebeling said McDonald's wanted ``to demonstrate the fact that,
first of all, Sokolof is all wet in implying there's too much fat
in McDonald's menu and in inferring we haven't been doing
everything possible to enhance our menu in every way that's
feasible with respect to nutrition and good health.
   ``Our menu is balanced and nutritious as it stands,'' Ebeling
said. ``These things are just an enhancement to it.''
   McDonald's also has taken steps recently to combat perceptions
that its heavy use of plastic and polystyrene foam contributes
greatly to pollution.
   McDonald's began a pilot program last year in 250 New England
restaurants that promote recycling of polystyrene food containers
and other plastics.
   Earlier this week, McDonald's announced plans to spend 25
percent of its $400 million-a-year construction budget on recycled
materials. The company also plans to use recycled paper for
carryout bags at 500 of its outlets.

<HEAD>Profit Falls at Weyerhaueser, Champion in 1st Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Thursday its earnings fell 12 percent in
the first quarter, while another paper products, Champion
International Corp., reported a 39 percent profit decline for the
same period.
   Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., reported it earned $130.1
million, or 61 cents a share, compared with $148.1 million, or 70
cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales slipped 1.7 percent to $2.28 billion from
$2.32 billion.
   George H. Weyerhaeuser, chairman and chief executive, told the
annual shareholders meeting that the weakness in pulp and paper
products was only partially offset by better results in forest
products and other areas.
   Champion, based in Stamford, Conn., said a softer market for
paper products led to its profit decline for the quarter.
   It reported net income of $70 million, or 67 cents per share, in
the quarter ending March 31, compared to $114 million, ot $1.16 a
share, a year ago. Revenue held steady at $1.3 billion.
   The company attributed the earnings decline to softer markets
for some paper products, as well as outages while it expanded and
improved several mills.
   Andrew C. Sigler, Champion's chairman and chief executive
officer, called the earnings disappointing but said in a statement
that business was ``reasonably good.''
   ``We are right in the thick of our capital program to reduce
costs and increase productivity,'' he said. ``We're paying for it
now because of the many outages, but we're already seeing positive
results. The full returns will come in over the course of the next
several years.''
   Net sales from Champion's paper operations were $1.02 billion,
up slightly, while income was $149.6 million, down from $211.6
million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Champion said income from its packaging operations was even with
last year, although results were down in other segments, including
domestic printing and writing papers, publication-grade paper, pulp
operations in the U.S. and Canada, and newsprint operations.
   Net sales for wood products were also down, from $273 million to
$262 million. Income was down from $23 million to $20 million.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small group of mostly immigrant workers who
speak 87 languages among them are responsible for federal
legislation allowing labor unions to negotiate for
affordable-housing assistance.
   The success by Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 26 stemmed
from the strength of its 5,000 members, hotel and food service
workers who struggled to eke out a living in one of the country's
most expensive cities, local president Domenic Bozzotto said
Thursday.
   ``It shows that when people get together over social
responsibility, you can build community,'' said Bozzotto. ``This is
what America is all about. We've shown all the cynics that
America's not dead. We're still in love with America. Our parents
told us anything could be done here and we're not jaded yet.''
   Union officials from New Jersey to California called the Local
26 offices Thursday to ask about the legislation President Bush
signed into law Wednesday. It was the first significant change in
the Taft-Hartley Act in 20 years and the first time a local union _
as opposed to an international union _ had effected a change,
Bozzotto said.
   Taft-Hartley has been the nation's overriding labor relations
law for 43 years. It includes anti-corruption provisions
prohibiting management from making direct payments to unions except
for certain purposes such as employee education, health care and
retirement. The amendment adds housing to that list.
   It became necessary after Local 26 negotiated in 1988 an
unprecedented agreement with nine Boston hotels requiring employers
to place money in a housing trust fund that could be used to
finance housing purchases and rentals.
   ``It's going to have a huge impact _ it's the new benefit of the
'90s,'' said Bruce Marks, housing director for Local 26 as he
fielded calls for information from unions and employers.
   The cost of the housing trust fund for employers for Local 26's
members is $1.5 million during the three-year contract. In
contrast, dental insurance in the contract will cost $2 million.
   Officials from the Teamsters union, United Auto Workers, the
firefighters' union in Toledo, Ohio, the United Food and Commercial
Workers in Michigan and the policemen and city workers' unions in
New York City were among callers.
   New York City unions were particularly interested because most
city workers are required to live in one of the five boroughs,
known for their expensive housing. The housing assistance plan may
someday be brought to the bargaining table, said Michael Musuraca
of District 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   Some employers are amenable.
   Peter van Kleeck, president of Saunders Hotels Co. in Boston
said he was first ``surprised'' at the demand but later became
``much more convinced.''
   ``We agreed to it voluntarily,'' Carl Madda, director of labor
relations for the Sheraton Corp., said in a brief statement. ``We
were satisfied by the negotiation. We hope it works out.''
   The legislative success is a story that began, according to
union officials, with universal predictions of failure.
   ``They said, `You're nuts.' But we take our philosophy from the
Reverend Jesse Jackson. Never surrender,'' said Bozzotto, a union
official since 1981.
   Bozzotto, 50, said he is typical of union members he said pushed
for the legislation.
   The son of an Italian immigrant who worked as a cook in a Boston
hotel, Bozzotto began work at age 13 as a hotel dishwasher. He
later moved up to busboy and waiter. He worked in hotels to pay his
way through college.
   ``It's brutal work,'' said Bozzotto. ``People only see the front
part of a hotel. If you're in the back, in the bowels of the
kitchen or the laundry room working in all that heat or steam, it's
hard, hard work.''
   He said most members of Local 26 work two or three jobs to meet
living costs. The average price of a single-family house in the
Boston area is $190,000 and an average two-bedroom apartment runs
about $800 a month.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Posts Profit Increase, Affiliated Posts Profit in
1st Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. posted a 25 percent increase in its
first-quarter profit on Thursday, while Affiliated Publications
Inc. said it had a profitable quarter in contrast to a loss in the
same period a year ago.
   A third media company, Pulitzer Publishing Co., said its profit
tumbled in the first three months of the year.
   Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, said it earned $25.8 million, or
50 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31 compared
with $20.5 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 2.6 percent to $554.9 million from
$540.7 million.
   ``The quarter's results were favorably impacted by significantly
lower newsprint prices, lower interest costs, a cut in our losses
in Detroit, good performances from our Business Information
Services Division and various joint ventures and approximately
800,000 fewer shares outstanding,'' said senior vice president and
chief financial officer Robert F. Singleton.
   The company's newspaper division posted lower earnings of $63.7
million, down from $64.6 million in the first quarter last year.
   Singleton said the calendar was partly to blame for lower
earnings as rthere was one fewer Sunday than a year ago.
   The business information services division had an operating
profit of $4.5 million, up 31.3 percent over last year's $3.4
million.
   Knight-Ridder's interests include 29 daily newspapers, business
news and information services, news, graphics and photo services as
well as cable television and newsprint manufacturing.
   Boston-based Affiliated Publications, which publishes The Boston
Globe, said it earned $6.5 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
three months ended April 1 in contrast to a loss of $9.9 million,
or 14 cents a share, in the sasme period in 1989.
   Revenue edged up to $133.7 million from $131.0 million a year
ago.
   The 1989 results reflected charges related to Affiliated's share
of losses from its former investment in McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. of Kirkland, Wash. The stake has since been
sold.
   Despite the improvement, the company said its results were
adversely affected by softness in advertising volume at the Globe.
   Affiliated Publications is the parent company of the Globe
Newspaper Co. and BPI Communications Inc., a leading publisher of
specialty magazines, books and electronic data bases for the
entertainment, arts and design markets.
   Pulitzer Publishing, based in St. Louis, Mo., blamed a 70
percent decline in its first-quarter earnings on lower results at
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and costs involved in the purchase of a
New Orleans television station.
   The company reported earnings of $906,000, or 9 cents per share,
on revenues of $95 million for the first quarter, compared with
earnings of $3 million, or 29 cents per share, on revenues of $94
million a year ago.
   ``The Post-Dispatch is confronting the effects of expanded
competition in a soft economy, as well as difficult labor
negotiations,'' said Chairman Joseph Pulitzer Jr.
   The decreased earnings also reflect costs connected with the
acquisition of WDSU-TV in New Orleans in December.
   Pulitzer's newspaper operations include two major metropolitan
dailies, the Post-Dispatch and The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson,
and newspapers and shoppers in the Chicago area, including the
Southtown Economist, a suburban daily and Sunday newspaper.
   Pulitzer's broadcasting operations consist of seven
network-affilitated television stations _ WYFF in Greenville, S.C.;
WEAL in Lancaster, Pa.; WXII in Winston-Salem, N.C.; KOAT in
Albuquerque, N.M.; KETV in Omaha, Neb.; WLKY in Louisville, Ky.;
and WDSU in New Orleans. Pulitzer also owns radio stations KTAR-AM
and KKLT-FM in Phoenix.

<HEAD>Lockheed Says Simmons' Suit Is `Pure Harassment'</HEAD>

   Harold Simmons' lawsuit challenging the
legality of the proxy war he lost for control of Lockheed Corp. is
``pure harassment'' and without merit, Lockheed Chairman Daniel
Tellep said Thursday.
   The company also reported that first quarter profits rose 11
percent because of lower tax payments.
   Simmons' federal suit, filed Wednesday, asks either for a new
election or that his nominees for Lockheed's board be declared the
winners. It alleges Lockheed illegally engineered extra proxy votes
through an employee stock ownership plan and played a variety of
dirty tricks to defeat Simmons.
   ``The results of the election were clear and decisive,'' Tellep
replied in a statement from Lockheed's headquarters in suburban
Calabasas.
   ``We are extremely disappointed that Simmons has chosen to
ignore the independently certified results despite losing the
election by over a 20 percent margin.''
   Tellep suggested again that Simmons was interested more in his
own investment than the good of the company.
   ``We view this action by Simmons as nothing more than pure
harassment,'' Tellep said. ``Simmons' action confirms our view that
he is interested only in advancing his own agenda at the expense of
other Lockheed shareholders.''
   Lockheed and Simmons also revealed Thursday they each spent
about twice as much as they originally estimated in fighting their
five-week battle, which culminated at the aerospace company's
annual meeting March 29. The incumbent board was retained by about
a 3-2 margin.
   Lockheed spokesman Stephen Chaudet said the company spent $15
million to persuade shareholders to re-elect the board of
directors. It originally estimated spending would total $8 million.
   Simmons, the Texas billionaire who owns about 19 percent of
Lockheed's stock, spent more than $10 million compared with an
initial $6 million estimate, said his chief strategist, J. Landis
Martin.
   Martin said Simmons bought about a dozen ads in national
newspapers and in smaller papers in areas where Lockheed does
business. That was twice the number he had anticipated, he said.
   Simmons also spent far more than expected on mailings to
Lockheed shareholders, particularly participants in the employee
stock ownership plan, Martin said.
   Chaudet also attributed Lockheed's extra expenses mainly to the
costs of newspaper advertisements and shareholder mailings.
   Separately, Lockheed said profits rose to $69 million, or $1.09
a share, in the first three months of the year from $62 million, or
$1.04 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 8 percent to $2.25
billion from $2.09 billion, an increase spread fairly evenly across
the corporation, Tellep said.
   Program profits were unchanged at $114 million, but Lockheed
spent $13 million less on income taxes than in the 1989 period,
helping to boost net profits.
   Martin, Simmons' chief lieutenant and the head of N.L.
Industries, through which Simmons bought his stake in Lockheed,
declined to comment on the results.
   Simmons contends that Lockheed, the nation's sixth largest
defense contractor, has been mismanaged under Tellep's leadership.
   His lawsuit contends the employee stock ownership plan, which
also owns about 19 percent of Lockheed's stock, is ``an illegal
entrenchment device'' set up by the board to put a large block of
stock in friendly hands.
   If the plan's votes and a few so-far challened proxies were
thrown out, Simmons' nominees would have won the election, the suit
contends.
   It also says Lockheed moved up the annual meeting date by six
weeks to rob Simmons of time to campaign, failed to mention
Simmons' nominees in its proxy material, and denied Simmons a
chance to present his case to members of the employee stock
ownership plan.

<HEAD>Filmed Entertainment Division Helps Push MCA Inc. Revenues to
Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. said its first quarter
net income rose 16 percent and revenues jumped 30 percent because
of strong gains at the company's filmed entertainment division.
   MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman said Thursday that net income rose
to $31.6 million, or 42 cents a share, from $27.3 million, or 37
cents a share, in the first three months of 1989.
   Revenues rose to $912.9 million from $703.3 million.
   Bolstered by such box-office hits as ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' and ``Back to the Future Part II,'' the filmed entertainment
group reported record first quarter revenues of $548.8 million,
compared with $396.7 million a year earlier.
   The division also was bolstered by the success of such
home-video releases as ``Field of Dreams,'' ``Parenthood'' and
``Uncle Buck.'' MCA said the division's foreign television sales
were down, though.
   Television revenues were $160.5 million, down from $169.4
million.
   Revenue from MCA's Universal Studios tour rose to $24.9 million
from $23.9 million.
