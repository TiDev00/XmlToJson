   The Associated Press on March 21 reported
erroneous vote totals in Tuesday's special elections in the 14th
and 18th Congressional Districts. The errors, contained in
tabulations by the News Election Service, did not affect the
candidates' order of finish.
   In the 14th District, some votes mistakenly were counted twice,
said Mike Bertha, business manager of NES. The corrected count gave
Republican Susan Molinari 28,236 votes, or 59 percent; Democrat
Robert J. Gigante 16,593 votes, or 35 percent; Right-to-Life Party
nominee Barbara Bollaert 2,581 votes, or 5 percent; and Liberal
Carl Grillo 437 votes, or 1 percent.
   In the 18th District, NES found minor errors in its count,
Bertha said. The corrected count gave Democrat Jose Serrano 26,728
votes, or 93 percent; Republican Simeon Golar 2,022 votes, or 7
percent; and Conservative Kevin Brawley 118 votes, or 0 percent.

<HEAD>Rich Indonesians Urged Not To Flaunt It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The country's leaders have admonished
rich Indonesians for years not to flaunt their wealth with luxury
homes or other conspicuous consumption.
   Now, President Suharto wants businessmen to help redistribute
wealth by selling shares in their companies to cooperatives.
   Home Minister Rudini declared in 1988: ``It is an insane idea
for people to compete to build mansions similar to the White House.
... They are asocial.''
   Retired Adm. Sudomo, coordinating minister for general policy
and security, said last year the slow spread of wealth was a
greater danger to stability than any political or military threat.
   Sudomo said ``the side effects of economic development'' were
not moving rapidly enough ``to cope with all the social problems so
we can narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.''
   Last month, Suharto said: ``Of course we cannot avoid
differences in levels of income and abilities, but these
differences should not be allowed to grow into a social gap that is
contrary to the spirit of togetherness.
   ``We must recognize these differences and take steps to minimize
them before it is too late.''
   Per capita annual income is less than $500 in this nation of 178
million people. The gap between rich and poor is great and a middle
class began to emerge only in the last generation.
   In his annual budget speech in January, Suharto urged companies
to sell 25 percent of their shares to cooperatives so the co-ops
could become a ``national economic force.'' He suggested making
loans to poorer cooperatives to help them buy the shares.
   Businessmen were surprised by the proposal and many dismissed it
as a populist response to criticism of powerful conglomerates.
   Indonesia has 34,000 cooperatives with about 26 million members.
They were established to give small farmers the advantages of mass
buying and marketing and to help introduce modern methods in
handicraft and cottage industries.
   Cooperatives, enshrined in the constitution, were intended as an
economic complement to state-owned enterprises and private
companies.
   Suharto has promoted cooperatives as the ideal way to help the
poor in a land where 70 percent of the people make their livings in
the countryside.
   Unfortunately, most cooperatives are perceived as poorly
managed, undercapitalized and burdened with bad debts. Of 6,000
rural credit co-ops, a 1988 World Bank report said, ``1,272 are
insolvent but not entirely hopeless, while 1,658 are candidates for
dissolution or liquidation.''
   Some businessmen, startled by the idea of selling shares to
cooperatives, hope Suharto's suggestion was a pep talk rather than
a new government policy of divestiture.
   As explained by Radius Prawiro, coordinating minister for
economy, finance and industry: ``This is an appeal and not an
entirely new policy. Helping one another must not be spelled out by
legislation. This is an appeal to the private sector to give
cooperatives a chance to own part of the equity.''
   Prawiro and other senior officials said private companies would
not be compelled to sell stock to cooperatives, but it was not made
clear how such transfers might occur without compulsion.
   Business analysts said few privately held companies would
voluntarily sell shares to cooperatives or lend money to finance
the purchases.
   Suharto's proposal followed months of statements by economists,
politicians and educators that efforts to deregulate the economy in
recent years benefited big enterprises at the expense of small
ones, especially of cooperatives.
   There were complaints that many of Indonesia's largest companies
are controlled by ethnic Chinese, who make up less than 5 percent
of the population but have great influence.
   Any belief that the Suharto proposal would fade away ended with
a major presidential gesture March 4. On that Sunday, he was host
on his farm at Tapos, 45 miles south of Jakarta, to 31 of
Indonesia's business leaders, most of them ethnic Chinese.
   ``A more equitable distribution of incomes should be developed,
together with growth and stability, otherwise social jealousy and
upheaval may break out to annihilate all our achievements,'' the
Jakarta Post quoted him as saying.
   He said conglomerates were useful in fighting tough
international competition, but should not become domestic
monopolies because ``they can also manipulate prices, causing the
people to suffer,'' the paper reported.
   Antara, the national news agency, quoted Suharto as saying that
``the government hopes the selling of shares to cooperatives will
proceed smoothly. ... If the transactions do not run smoothly, the
government will take measures to see to it that they do.''
   ``If this fails to proceed, the existing gap will only give rise
to social envy and social upheavals,'' Antara quoted him as saying.
``There will thus be no winners.''
   Suharto told the businessmen the government would prepare a list
of worthy cooperatives deemed to have the necessary financial
resources.
   ``That way,'' he said, ``you would not have to look for such
cooperatives.''

   Police found three children and their mother
shot to death Wednesday in a murder-suicide apparently triggered by
family and money troubles, authorities said.
   The bodies were found in a house in the San Fernando Valley
about 4:30 p.m. by a friend who was checking up on the family.
   The children, aged 7 to 16, apparently were shot in their sleep,
and their 32-year-old mother, Roxanne Fernandez Jones, had what
appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said police
Detective Rick Swanston.
   The family dog was also found dead.
   ``The family had been having some financial and personal
problems of late, and that appears to be the motive,'' said
Swanston.
   The children were identified as Brandy Fernandez, 16; Leticia
Fernandez, 13 and Jeremiah Jones, 7.
   The house is about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

   It seemed so simple. A pair of scientists
had unlocked the mysteries of nuclear fusion after an inspirational
walk in the woods and a couple of shots of sour mash.
   It was never so simple again.
   A year after chemists B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann
announced they'd achieved room temperature or ``cold'' fusion in a
laboratory flask, their work remains devilishly difficult to
duplicate.
   Not only has subsequent research failed to nurture initial hopes
for a clean and limitless energy source, but cold fusion has cooled
to the point that a chief supporter describes it as a commercial
gamble.
   ``This is one of those areas where a certain amount of
risk-taking is needed, but the payoff is very large,'' said Fritz
G. Will, director of the state-funded National Cold Fusion
Institute. ``We need luck and money.''
   If either is forthcoming, it will require a reversal in cold
fusion's fortunes in the laboratory.
   ``As a whole _ and it's always dangerous to characterize how the
scientific community thinks on this _ but on the whole, the
scientific community is still extremely skeptical about it,'' said
Ronald Parker, director of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Plasma Fusion Center.
   Pons, a University of Utah chemistry professor, and Fleischmann,
of England's University of Southampton, announced their findings at
a press conference last March 23.
   They described how they hatched the idea for the experiment
during a hike in the Utah mountains, then sketched the apparatus in
Pons' kitchen over a bottle of Jack Daniel's.
   Eventually, they said, they created a nuclear fusion reaction in
a bottle of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, using a palladium
electrode wrapped in platinum wire. They ran electricity through
the two metals and reported that the device put out more energy
than they put into it.
   The announcement, stunning in its possibilities, conjured
visions of a cheap, relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible
supply of energy. Normally, fusion has occurred under enormously
expensive extremes of heat and pressure.
   Conventional nuclear energy, or fission, splits atoms; fusion
produces energy by fusing them together.
   After the announcement, scientists lambasted Pons and
Fleischmann for rushing to the popular press with neither a theory
to explain the results nor ability to reproduce them at will.
   A year later, they have yet to publish definitive scientific
papers detailing their research.
   Other scientists tried to replicate the process. Few met with
success and many gave up, although work continues in universities
and centers such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico, and in laboratories in Japan, India, and the Soviet Union.
   ``The first few months after the announcement was made, people
thought that it would be exceedingly simple to reproduce the
results,'' Will said. ``The complexities were not fully appreciated
by anyone at that time.''
   MIT researchers conducted experiments but never detected excess
heat or evidence of a nuclear reaction, Parker said in a recent
telephone interview.
   ``To me, the question now is, is there anything at all to it?''
Parker said. ``Or is it completely a misunderstanding or
misevaluation of preliminary results?''
   Indeed, the Department of Energy's Energy Research Advisory
Board last November refused to recommend federal funding for the
Utah researchers, saying their conclusions failed to withstand
scientific scrutiny.
   The institute so far has received funding only from the Utah
Legislature, which last year appropriated $5 million for research
and patent attorneys charged with protecting the state's interests.
   Not all the scientists are giving up.
   Edmund Storms at Los Alamos said he and colleague Carol Talcott
have detected tritium, considered a sign of a nuclear fusion
reaction, in experiments modeled after the Pons-Fleischmann
apparatus.
   Storms, Talcott and about 30 other scientists will present their
findings during the University of Utah's first Conference on Cold
Fusion, March 29-31.
   ``The really interesting thing about this, and I think it has
relevance to the anger and frustration, is that the apparatus was
so simple, so incredibly trivial, that the feeling was, why can't
we reproduce it?'' Storms said.
   Pons did not respond to requests for an interview with The
Associated Press. He defended their claims in a story in the
Deseret News on Sunday.
   ``We know what we have. We know we have something,'' he said.
``To us it's an ironclad, open-and-shut case. We are going to
continue with whatever means we have to take this as far as we can
toward demonstration and practical use.''

<HEAD>Teaching Makes Dramatic Comeback After Early 1980s Slump</HEAD>

   A new survey indicates a jump in interest in
teaching, which fell on hard times in the early 1980s after word
got around that the only thing tougher than finding a teaching job
was living on the salary.
   Enrollment in the nation's teaching programs rose by 61 percent
between 1985 and 1989 and the figure would have been higher had all
those who applied been accepted, according to an unpublished study
by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.
   ``As someone who makes his living teaching people to be
teachers, I'm ecstatic!'' said Gary Galluzzo, an associate
professor at Western Kentucky University and co-chair of the study.
   And there's more good news. While the perennially popular social
studies have held steady, the interest inteacher-poor subjects such
as math and science appear to be keeping apace.
   But the progress is not all positive. Researchers said total
enrollments may have skyrocketed, but elementary and secondary
school teachers are still mostly white and female.
   Minority participation in schools of education exceeds 15
percent in only six states while 33 states had minority
public-school enrollments of 20 percent or more, according to the
survey, which was presented in Chicago last month at the
association's annual meeting.
   ``The enrollment thing is fine and all well, but the fact that
they don't have any minorities is really a huge headache,'' said
Mary Dilworth, director of research and information for the
Washington, D.C.,-based association.
   Explanations for the overall surge vary but the numbers come as
no surprise to admissions officers, who said they have seen a
gradual but constant increase in enrollment each of the last five
years.
   The average number of education-degree candidates enrolled at 90
U.S. colleges and universities surveyed randomly went from 520 to
835 between 1985-88, the study said.
   Administrators at teaching programs around the nation attributed
improved enrollment largely to the exposure through the mid-1980s
of serious problems in the U.S. education system.
   Many parents tuned in to the trouble when a National
Geographic-sponsored Gallup poll in July 1988 indicated Americans
ranked among the bottom third in an international test of
geographic knowledge, and those ages 18-24 came in last.
   The issue was also signaled by President Bush's push for the
``Education Excellency Act of 1989'' and projections that the
demand for teachers would exceed by 1 million the supply needed
between 1988 and 1995.
   ``It's impossible to pick up an article about teachers without
seeing the word `shortage' and people seem to be picking this up,''
Galluzzo said. ``People who always wanted to be teachers and who
were told there were no jobs are now returning to get their
credential.''
   Pragmatic incentives have also spurred potential teaching degree
candidates. Salaries have risen, and encouraging educational
reforms have slowly taken root, education researchers said.
   ``The news went out that teachers were needed and states were
working for better salaries and conditions,'' said Dilworth. ``In
the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was the same situation: We were
told there was a shortage of teachers and by 1982 we'd peaked out.''
   Galluzzo said he had no survey results prior to 1985, but
administrators believe the pool of teaching degree candidates hit
bottom in 1984.
   Carly Moreno, director of admissions at Harvard University's
Graduate School of Education, said interest in teaching had been
spurred by demand and discussion. But she said some applicants also
were looking for alternatives to seeking fortunes on Wall Street.
   ``I think this group knows they're not in it for the money, but
for their idealism,'' said Moreno, who received 200 applications in
1989 compared with 40 five years ago. ``They have anxiety about the
world and want to contribute in a positive way.''
   But some administrators said candidates weren't necessarily
coming to education for reasons of pure altruism.
   ``My theory is that most of them have been coming for economic
security, in one measure or another,'' said L.Y. Hollis, director
of the University of Houston's education center.
   ``The notion that the citizens of this country have elevated
teaching to a position of respect and dignity is sheer fantasy,''
he said. ``God, mother, country and working with kids is all cool,
but not if you don't have money to pay the rent.''
   Hollis said applications to Houston's teaching program had
jumped dramatically until 1989, when they dropped by more than half
as Texas's slumping oil economy began recovering. The association's
nationwide enrollment figures for last year were not complete.
   ``All the posters that `Uncle Sam Wants You' will bring in a few
people, but when it's all said and done ... it's going to take more
than a flashy campaign to truly get people interested in
teaching,'' Hollis said.

   In this neat, prosperous market town
in middle England, a farm worker's wife says she'll never vote for
Margaret Thatcher again.
   ``She simply doesn't know what's happening to people,'' said
30-year-old Joanne Woodward. A bystander interrupted her: ``The
woman's a tyrant.''
   For the prime minister's Conservative Party candidate, Charles
Prior, it is tough on the campaign trail in Mid-Staffordshire. The
socialist Labor Party looks set to capture the once unshakeable
Conservative constituency in today's by-election.
   By-elections, which fill vacant parliamentary seats, are always
watched for indications of the standing of the government. This one
threatens the Tories with their worst by-election defeat in 50
years.
   Mid-Staffordshire's last member of Parliament, who committed
suicide in December, held the district with a huge majority in
Britain's 1987 general election. Now local opinion polls show Labor
up to 28 points ahead.
   The Labor Party poses its most serious challenge since Mrs.
Thatcher won power in May 1979, and victory here would bolster
Labor's prospects of winning the next general election.
   Those elections aren't due until 1992.
   ``I won't deny it. We are in some difficulty,'' said Prior, a
43-year-old publisher.
   A brooding statue of Lichfield's most famous son, the
18th-century poet and dictionary compiler Samuel Johnson, dominates
the market place of a town that as far as anyone can remember has
never voted socialist.
   Lichfield, with 24,000 people, is the affluent end of a
semi-rural constituency north of Birmingham.
   The people are mostly skilled blue-collar workers and young
homeowning couples: people who through the 1980s deserted Labor for
a slice of the prosperity brought by Mrs. Thatcher's free-market
revolution.
   Now they are hard hit by interest rates soaring to 15 percent
and inflation at 7.7 percent and rising. Both have roughly doubled
since 1987, when Mrs. Thatcher won her unprecedented third straight
election.
   On top of that, Lichfield votes amid a national furor over the
introduction next month of a new property tax that will cost many
families up to one-third more.
   There are just two topics in the political small talk over the
handshakes: the tax and Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``She had a lot of good ideas in the beginning and I've always
voted Conservative,'' said Mrs. Woodward. ``But now she's making a
real mess of things ... They'd do much better with a different
leader.''
   Mrs. Woodward lives in a rent-free cottage on the farm where her
husband manages the piggery. The Woodwards paid no property taxes
in the past, but now they must each pay $560 under the new tax
system.
   Labor's candidate, Sylvia Heal, a 47-year-old social worker, is
also benefitting from the collapse of the political center after
the 1987 general election.
   The centrist Social and Liberal Democrats' Tim Jones, a local
lawyer, took 23 percent of the Mid-Staffordshire vote last time
compared with Labor's 25 percent and the Tories' 50 percent.
   Jones is down to around 9 percent in the polls, with the
Conservatives' Prior battling for 28-30 percent and Mrs. Heal at
more than 50 percent.
   Pranksters and single-issue candidates are also expected to grab
some of the vote.
   Nine fringe candidates are counting on the ultra-protest vote.
They include Lindy Sinclair-Love of the Nice Party, whose platform
is tax-exempt status for prostitutes.
   They probably won't get more than a few dozen votes apiece, but
that's not the point. Their efforts are worthwhile just for the
pleasure of watching a TV newscaster, bound by equal coverage laws,
trying to keep a straight face as he reads out: ``Screaming Lord
Sutch, Monster Raving Loony Party.''

   The human race is
accelerating the global warming trend by cutting down the world's
forests too fast, the executive director of the U.N. Environment
Program says.
   On a global basis, only one tree is replanted for every 10 that
are cut, the official, Mostafa Tolba, said Wednesday.
   The deforestation is contributing to the greenhouse effect, the
greatest environmental threat facing humanity, he told a conference
on business and the environment.
   He called for a major effort to restore forests around the world
and to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is
building up in the atmosphere.
   ``Controls on carbon dioxide are inevitable,'' he said, calling
on industry to conduct massive research into production methods
that pollute less.
   Tolba, a microbiologist from Egypt, played a major role in
negotiating the 1987 Montreal Protocol to reduce use of chemicals
that deplete the ozone layer. The goal is to establish an
international agreement on greenhouse gases by 1992.
   Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse effect gas, is produced by
the burning of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. Deforestation
also contributes to the problem because living trees absorb carbon
dioxide.
   The Globe '90 conference, which began Sunday and ends Friday,
has attracted more than 2,200 delegates from 56 countries. An
accompanying trade fair has drawn more than 600 exhibitors from 15
countries.
   About 200 Indians on Wednesday staged a demonstration in
Vancouver to protest pollution and the lack of Indian
representation at the conference.
   Saul Terry, president of the Union of British Columbia Indians
Chiefs, said natives want a say in forming the kinds of policies
that will affect the environment.

the induction April 21 of three new members into the Clown Hall of
Fame.
   This year's inductees: the late Joseph Grimaldi, an English
clown who appeared in London theaters in the late 1700s; Bob
Keeshan, best known for his role as Captain Kangaroo; and Leon
McBryde, a former Ringling clown and a former Ronald McDonald.
   Harmon and network weatherman Willard Scott, a former Bozo, are
to receive the first Lifetime of Laughter Achievement Awards.

   Sweet Adelines Inc., founded in 1945 for
women who wanted to experience the bliss of barbershop harmony, is
not changing its tune _ just its name.
   ``Some people don't think Sweet Adelines indicates what our
organization is about,'' said Jorja Jacobs, communications director
for Sweet Adelines, which will become Harmony International Corp.
on May 1.
   The organization is about singing, but it has come a long way
since a group of women adopted the name from Harry Armstrong's 1903
song, ``You're the Flower of My Heart, Sweet Adeline.''
   Now there are 30,000 members in a dozen countries, from New
Zealand to Japan to Canada. The board of directors voted
unanimously last summer that an international group deserves an
international name.
   ``Sweet Adeline to someone would probably conjure up the Gay
'90s,'' club President Marsha O'Neill said Wednesday from her
office in London, Canada. ``To me, you think of gentlemen with
handlebar mustaches and women in parasols. That's the identity of
the era, but that's not us today.''
   Some things will not change, said Verna Lee Fowler, a member of
a Tulsa chapter.
   ``The change gives you mixed emotions, but eventually it's going
to be all right,'' Ms. Fowler said. ``Besides, we might be called
harmonizers, but we're still Sweet Adelines. The spirit is still
there.''

   Major Bryant went right back to work
after beating out more than 850 other contestants in Orlando for
the title of Florida's ``Most Productive Older Worker Still on the
Job.''
   But the fact that Bryant, 79, was back on the job at 6 a.m.
Tuesday, two hours before his regular workday begins, didn't
surprise his employer, Kuhn Flowers.
   After all, he hasn't missed a day of work during his 61 years
with Kuhn and its predecessor companies.
   ``I was somewhat surprised,'' said Bryant of the award presented
Monday by the Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security.
   The prizes accompanying the award include the use of a Ford
Lincoln Town Car for a year, a six-day trip to Freeport, Bahamas,
and a round-trip airline ticket anywhere in the United States.
   Bryant, a receiving clerk who handles an average of 5,000
flowers a day, said he doesn't expect his life to change.
   He said he will pick up his new car, but will probably stick to
his 1987 Ford Taurus for most of his driving.
   He hasn't decided when he will take his trips.
   ``Major's going to have to retire to take advantage of all these
prizes,'' said Cheryl Logan, personnel manager at Kuhn Flowers.

   Thar's gold in them thar' sewers.
   This Gold Rush town is finding old coins in sludge collected
from the community's 17 miles of sewers. The hydraulic cleaning
began early this month after accidental raw sewage spills clogged
the lines.
   With half the job done, workers who go through the sludge from
each truck have found 2,411 coins: 970 pennies, 201 nickels, 677
dimes, 199 quarters and four 50-cent pieces. That comes to $139.20.
Plus a Mexican two-peso gold piece.
   But city Manager Beryl Robinson Jr., a coin collector, said
Wednesday: ``I'm still hoping we hit a good one. ... The city could
conceivably find a coin worth $50,000. That is definitely a
possibility.''
   He called the Mexican piece ``probably the most minimal gold
coin we could possibly find.''
   Some other gold coins, silver dollars and territorial pieces can
be worth more, he said. A $1 Moffett gold piece minted in San
Francisco could fetch about $10,000 and an 1893 Morgan silver
dollar could be worth more than $300,000.
   Robinson hopes any newfound treasure will go toward defraying
debts. Among the debts of the city, in the Sierra Nevada about 125
miles northeast of San Francisco, is a $10,000 state fine for the
sewage spills into Deer Creek.

   A University of Texas library is getting
some ``wild and crazy'' new assets: comedian-actor Steve Martin,
who writes much of his material, is donating original scripts.
   The first batch of Martin scripts arrived at the Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center early this month, including drafts,
revisions and final shooting scripts for the screenplays
``Roxanne'' and ``Three Amigos.''
   More Martin scripts are expected, said Ray Daum, public affairs
officer and curator of the Gloria Swanson archives at the Ransom
center. He said he pursued the material for two years from Martin,
who's a Waco native.

   Anthony Quinn says he's never been scared of
dying, not even by heart bypass surgery. But he admitted making out
a will before he underwent surgery last month.
   Quinn called the operation ``a breeze'' in an interview taped
Wednesday for ``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   ``It's complicated for the doctor, but for you it's very
simple,'' the 75-year-old actor said.
   Although he made out the will before going under the knife, he
said the thought of dying doesn't worry him.
   ``I've never been afraid of death,'' he said. ``I don't think it
exists. ... I think it's just a change that you go through.
   ``There's a light at the other end of a tunnel that is just
another life and I think it's a better life than this one, without
all the wars and all the hunger and all the nonsense that's going
on now.''
   The interview will be broadcast Friday.

   As a boy, Hank Williams Jr. enjoyed
hunting and fishing in southeast Alabama. Now he wants to help
flood victims in that region.
   The country singer's manager, Merle Kilgore, said Wednesday that
Williams will donate his entire concert fee plus concession sales
from an April 1 appearance in Birmingham to the people of Elba.
Kilgore said the amount is expected to exceed $100,000.
   The rain-swollen Pea River swept away parts of a levee
surrounding Elba last weekend and inundated the town, forcing 1,500
people to evacuate.
   Kilgore said that Gov. Guy Hunt's office will administer the
money and that Williams wants every family in Elba to receive part
of it.
   Williams as a boy spent his summers with his maternal
grandfather, Shelton Sheppard, who lived in nearby Troy.
   ``They would go hunting and fishing and that is the reason that
part of Alabama is dear to his heart,'' Kilgore said. ``He also has
been inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and he feels a
special fondness for the state for that reason, also.''

   Nearly 100 police officers were needed to
control thousands of rowdy fans who blocked traffic and spilled
into a major boulevard to see the British band Depeche Mode.
   About 3,000 fans and autograph seekers gathered outside the
Wherehouse record store late Tuesday, said police Sgt. Emilio
Perez, and ``several of the people started throwing rocks and
bottles.''
   Lisa Perez, a receptionist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
emergency room, said five youths were treated for minor injuries
and were released.
   ``People were getting stepped on and one girl fainted,'' said
Art Cortez, 16, who was in the crowd. ``It was like a riot.''
   Almost 100 officers in riot gear were eventually needed to calm
the crowd, which had been expected to be about 400, police said.
Police cordoned off the area for about two hours and made no
arrests, said Capt. Keith Bushy.
   ``My guess is the Wherehouse was somewhat surprised by the
situation they created also. Unfortunately, they failed to plan it
adequately,'' Bushy said. ``I think they created a monster without
realizing it.''
   Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he will propose a law making
organizers pay for police and fire costs, which he said will
discourage such events.
   ``You can't have this on the sidewalk on La Cienega Boulevard.
This is a group that sells out the Rose Bowl in five minutes,''
Yaroslavsky said. ``They put at risk the lives and safety of
thousands of young people.''
   The group, currently on the charts with their single ``Personal
Jesus,'' was promoting their new album ``Violator,'' which was
released Tuesday.

<HEAD>Airport Foes Suspected In Attacks on Two Airline Executives' Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fires at the homes of two airline company
executives early today destroyed two cars and damaged part of a
house, and police said they believed opponents of an airport
expansion project were to blame.
   No injuries were reported.
   Police said they suspected both fires were carried out by
leftist extremists who oppose the expansion of the Narita
international airport, which is 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   In Machida, on the western outskirts of Tokyo, a passenger car
at the home of Akio Kondo, president of All Nippon Airways, burst
into flames about 4:30 a.m., an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
batteries and electric wires of the type commonly used in
time-ignition devices were found near the burned car.
   Minutes later, in Kawasaki, a city just southwest of Tokyo, a
passenger car in a garage at the home of Fumio Watanabe, chairman
of Japan Airlines, was burned. The garage and one wall of
Watanabe's house were damaged, police said.
   An official of the Kanagawa Prefectural Police, who also spoke
on condition of anonymity, said a Watanabe family member first
noticed the fire and tried to put it out with an extinguisher
before calling the local fire department.
   On Feb. 27, the home of the president of a major Japanese
construction firm involved in a project to expand the airport was
destroyed by arson.
   The official and his wife were at home when the early morning
fire broke out but fled safely.
   The Chukaku-ha, or the radical leftist Middle Core Faction,
later claimed responsibility.
   Anti-government radical groups, including the 5,000-strong
Chukaku-ha, have along with farmers been campaigning against
government plans to expropriate farmland for the construction of an
additional runway at the airport.

<HEAD>Survey: College Sex Habits Largely Unchanged Despite AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students are more likely to use condoms
these days, but otherwise their sexual practices have changed
little in the last 14 years despite the advent of AIDS, a survey
published today shows.
   The study, conducted at Brown University, found that college
women reported just as much potentially risky sexual behavior last
year as they did in 1975, before AIDS and some other sexually
transmitted diseases became concerns.
   Besides acquired immune deficiency syndrome, genital herpes and
chlamydia have since emerged as important sexually transmitted
diseases.
   The results ``indicate that public health campaigns have not had
a substantial influence on the habits and behavior of these
well-educated young adults,'' said the study in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The survey, led by Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, found that 12 percnt
of women in 1975 said their partners always used condoms. This
increased to 21 percent in 1986 and 41 percent in 1989.
   But the number of sex partners or the frequency of high-risk sex
since 1975 remained virtually the same. In 1989, 9 percent of the
women engaged in anal intercourse, and 21 percent had more than
three sex partners during the year.
   In general, health officials recommend that people use condoms,
avoid anal sex and limit the number of sex partners to reduce the
risk of AIDS.

<HEAD>Census Forms to be Sent Out Starting Friday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Households across the nation will receive
census forms in the mail starting Friday, as the head count shifts
its focus from the homeless to the rest of the U.S. population.
   The most ambitious effort ever to count the homeless wound up
early Wednesday, with Census Bureau Director Barbara Everett Bryant
proclaiming success.
   ``We can now move on to the rest of America,'' she said, urging
people to complete their census forms and send them back promptly.
   Nearly 85 million census forms already have been trucked to bulk
distribution centers of the U.S. Postal Service. They will go into
the hands of letter carriers Friday for delivery to homes
nationwide.
   Forms will be stuffed in mailboxes or held with other mail, but
they will not be forwarded to people who have moved.
   People who haven't received a form by April 2 are being asked to
call the Census Bureau, which will send out a worker known as an
enumerator to make sure they get counted. The number to call is
1-800-999-1990.
   Census Day is April 1, and the bureau wants people to fill out
the forms to show their residence and family situation as of that
day.
   Just getting the material delivered and returned through the
mail is costing nearly $44 million in postage, a fraction of the
estimated $2.5 billion overall cost of the head count.
   With the nation's population at about 250 million, that amounts
to $10 each. In fact, since the actual count is done only every 10
years, bureau officials like to say it averages out to only $1 a
year for each American.
   Millions will be saved if the forms are returned promptly
because that will save census takers from having to visit those
people, a more expensive undertaking.
   Census workers will have to visit lots of homes in any case.
   While commercial address lists were purchased covering about 85
million homes, there are nearly 100 million residences in the
country. There were no good, accurate mailing lists for the other
15 million.
   That means census takers will have to visit those places,
largely in rural areas such as hollows in West Virginia, isolated
communities in Alaska and lonely ranches in the West.
   To collect the mass of material, the bureau is hiring 480,000
temporary employees. And they won't be desk-bound bureaucrats,
because the agency bought them only 68,000 desks and 75,000 chairs.
   The workers will use 9,360,000 pencils to process census forms
that consumed 5,000 tons of paper and 2,700 pounds of ink in
printing.
   The forms will be shredded, pulped and recycled after the
information has been obtained _ although microfilm copies will be
maintained for future reference.
   Information on any individual remains secret for 72 years, after
which the microfilm goes to the National Archives and is available
to historians and to people researching ancestors.
   Once the counting of heads is done, the processing of data has
just begun.
   Analysis of the information obtained in the census will take
years. Plans currently call for publication of as many as 900
different reports over that time.
   They will be printed on paper, released on compact discs, tapes,
diskettes and microfilm producing the equivalent of 420,000 pages
of information.
   That's a bit more than the first census in 1790, which was
complete in 56 pages.

<HEAD>Draft Proposal Proposes $2 Billion in Aid for East Europe</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Senate Foreign Relations subcommittees begin separate

<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats are outlining a new $2
billion aid package for Eastern Europe _ far more than President
Bush wants to spend and several times what Democrats themselves
proposed just two months ago.
   The draft bill escalates a Democratic argument that Bush has
been too timid in aiding the emerging democracies and establishing
a foothold for U.S. companies in their newly free economies.
   The bill by Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Joseph R. Biden,
D-Del., includes a $1.2 billion U.S. share in a European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, proposed by France to finance
public works and new private enterprises in former communist
economies.
   A copy of the draft was obtained Wednesday by The Associated
Press.
   The administration has conditioned U.S. participation in the
bank on it refusal to lend for government projects or private
ventures in the Soviet Union.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and other administration
officials acknowledge that the bank, with commitments already from
most Western European countries and Japan, is going forward with or
without a U.S. role.
   ``Our economic competitors are racing to establish strong
footings in Eastern Europe,'' Biden said Wednesday. ``We took a
stutter step in the wrong direction when (the bank) was being set
up and we lost our influence.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
administration's actions threaten to lock U.S. companies out of
billions of dollars in new exports and technical aid that the bank
will be financing.
   ``It's a brand new world and unless we throw off old ways of
thinking rooted in Cold War mentality, we risk being left behind,''
Gephardt told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Wednesday.
   The new bill by Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and Biden, who chairs the panel's subcommittee on
international economics and trade, is four times the $511 million
in new aid they proposed just two months ago.
   The administration has proposed $300 million in new aid in
fiscal 1991 for Eastern Europe beyond the $738 million that
Congress set aside last year for helping Poland and Hungary through
1992.
   Administration officials have said any more money could not be
absorbed by the Eastern European economies without being wasted.
   ``Businesses are waiting for the government to go first and
cover risks in the region and the government is waiting for
business leaders to go in on their own,'' Biden complained. ``What
we're lacking is the vision to develop programs that transform our
military presence in Europe to a political and economic presence.''
   The bill would give the administration flexibility in dividing
the aid among Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia in addition to Poland and Hungary.
   It would expand total aid to the seven countries to $2.75
billion by the end of 1992 but does not say where the money would
be found. Except for some food programs, the measure does not
specify how much is to go to each country.
   On Tuesday, Sens. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vermont, proposed shifting some of the $800 million in new
foreign aid that Bush wants for Nicaragua and Panama to Eastern
Europe.
   While providing no direct aid to the Soviet government, the bill
authorizes Bush to extend aspects of the program to the Soviet
Union if they promote U.S. values there.
   For example, it would authorize the AFL-CIO, using $40 million
in increased funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, to
help foster effective trade unions in the Soviet Union, as it did
with the Solidarity movement in Poland.
   Portions of a $44 million boost in Peace Corps spending in the
region also could be used for teaching English to Soviet citizens.
   ``This is a penetration program, not an aid program,'' Biden
said. ``The goal is to penetrate the Soviet Union with American
values.''
   Included is $200 million to create U.S. business centers in the
seven East European countries to give technical and other aid for
helping American companies establish a foothold in their markets.

<HEAD>US Should Oppose Other Countries' Violence Against Women, Hearing
Told</HEAD>

   Forced marriages and prostitution, rape and
other violence against women aren't acceptable here and shouldn't
be tolerated by the United States anywhere, human rights advocates
say.
   ``The widespread hands-off attitude about violence against women
is often excused as awareness of cultural traditions,'' Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said at a congressional hearing
Wednesday.
   ``Just as racism is not an acceptable cultural tradition,
neither is violence against women,'' she said.
   Mrs. Schroeder said the United States should use its persuasive
abilities in the area of human rights to convince countries to obey
their own laws.
   ``Some of the countries have laws against things that are common
practice, but they don't enforce them,'' said Mrs. Schroeder, who
co-chairs the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues.
   ``Beating and raping are not culture, torture is not culture,
sexual surgery is not culture: they are violence and they are
violations of human rights,'' the congresswoman told the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human rights and international
organizations.
   The hearing was one in a series being held by subcommittee
Chairman Gus Yatron, D-Pa., on other governments' actions on
violence against women.
   ``Based on information from the State Department's recently
released human rights report and from independent sources, it is
clear that human rights violations targeted against women because
of their gender is pervasive throughout every region of the
world,'' Yatron said.
   Goler Butcher of Amnesty International said women prisoners
often are victims of sexual violence by guards or other government
representatives.
   She said this so-called custodial rape has been documented by
her organization in India, the Philippines, Lebanon, Turkey, Iran,
Somalia, Zaire, Chile, Argentina before 1983, Guatemala, Sri Lanka,
El Salvador, Burma, Pakistan and Uganda.
   ``In the Peruvian Andes, in areas of conflict between government
forces and insurrectionist guerrillas, rape of women is
widespread,'' said Butcher. ``Legal officials told Amnesty
International representatives visiting Ayacucho province in 1986
that rape was to be expected when troops are based in the rural
areas. They said it was `natural' and prosecutions could not be
expected.''
   Butcher said that even in the United States, at the Female High
Security Unit of Lexington Federal Prison in Kentucky, the women
were subjected to repeated strip-searching which appeared to be in
excess of security needs.
   She told of a pregnant prisoner in El Salvador who was tortured,
forced to stand for days with her hands tied over head and
continually threatened with rape, who gave premature birth to an
infant who died after a month.
   Felice Gaer, executive director of the International League for
Human Rights, said U.S. foreign policy has neglected women's rights.
   She said the United States has fought against slavery but not
against forced prostitution or the sex tourism business.
   Gaer questioned whether the right of women in other countries to
appear in court or be witnesses on equal basis with men has been
part of the U.S. advocacy of fair trials in those countries.
   The witnesses called for U.S. ratification of an international
treaty known as the Convention on Elimination of Discrimination
Against Women.
   Gaer said the United States should take an active role in
implementing the treaty by seeking membership on the committee that
supervises compliance of it.
   She also recommended that trade sanctions be used against
countries that violate U.S. standards for the treatment of women.

   Census workers thrown into a brutal world of
human feces and drifts of broken wine bottles for their first-ever
tally of the homeless entered reluctantly _ and in some cases, not
at all.
   ``No, I don't want to come in,'' one worker shouted at 5 a.m.
Wednesday, standing on the sidewalk with blank census forms in her
hand.
   She hollered up at a reporter in the dark hole of a missing
third-floor window: ``If it was daylight I might.''
   People slept inside the abandoned downtown hotel. Their grimy,
bare mattresses hugged the corners of rooms. The lumps in the dark
were barely distinguishable from other piles _ rags, little Gideon
Bibles, rotted food, human feces.
   It stunk of urine.
   Groping a way out became a listening game of telling the soft
crunch of flaked paint _ thick as potato chips on the floor _ from
the sharper give of broken glass.
   The census worker and her partner wouldn't come in.
   Instead, an old man went out. He crawled up over a refrigerator
and through a basement window. He wore two pairs of pants, neither
size the right one, and two coats losing the white fluff of their
insulation.
   He was counted.
   Many weren't, even by the Census Bureau's own assessment. In
some cases, homeless people avoided the census takers; in others,
they were apparently overlooked.
   In Detroit, census takers checked seedy hotels where homeless
paid $12 a night for rooms. And they passed over three of four
major shelters in the city's war-zonelike Cass Corridor.
   Sam Hargrove waited all night for census takers at the Salvation
Army Harbor Light shelter to come count the 55 men stretched out on
cots within. They didn't show.
   Kevin Young waited at the Detroit Rescue Mission two blocks away
with nearly 130 homeless to be counted.
   ``I guess I'm an optimist,'' Young said. ``Normally the homeless
are the aspect that get left out.''
   He was sure somebody would come. Nobody did.
   And nobody showed at the nearby Neighborhood Service
Organization walk-in center, where about 70 men were inside and
another 10 slept on the foyer floor in a thick cloud of human smell.
   The Census Bureau spent $2.7 million on the homeless count,
which it carried out between 6 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday in
every city with a population over 50,000. The officials defended
their effort and said it would provide a valuable ``snapshot'' of
the state of the homeless.
   But the count was an abstract thing to the five shivering men
stomping their feet on a Detroit side street. They sounded angry.
   This special census changed nothing, they said.
   ``I've been in these streets for 50 years. I ain't going to be
counted. You don't be counting me,'' said Joseph Antonio Carter Jr.
   He was tense. Police sirens sounded a few blocks away. Shadows
of men passed in the vacant lot behind them. One man slipped into
the brush to sleep beneath a pile of cardboard. Others gathered at
the corner in the fluorescent glow of an open liquor store.
   Carter pushed his hands deep inside his pockets, shoulders
hunched up against the cold. The census takers would leave at dawn.
He would still be here.
   ``They go home to their nice warm castles while we're out here
begging for crumbs,'' Carter said. ``We got the same damn thing
every night.''
   ``... Tonight, tomorrow, next week, next week and the week after
that,'' said his friend, Fred. ``Ain't that right?''
   ``Right, man.''
   Tuesday was only another night in the streets.
   Isaac, 23 and selling drugs since 12, didn't believe anyone
really cared about a homeless count.
   ``They want the homeless to think they're getting the ball
rolling,'' he said. ``I have heard so much is going to happen to
help us. It doesn't.''

<HEAD>Three Accused of Conspiring to Pass Contract Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy procurement official and two
consultants are under indictment on charges they conspired to pass
confidential contract information to defense firms.
   George G. Stone, a former division head at the Navy's Space and
Naval Warfare Systems Command, is accused of participating in the
conspiracy with consultants Thomas E. Muldoon and Mark C. Saunders.
   The indictment, returned Wednesday by a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va., is the latest product of an investigation of
Pentagon procurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   It charged that Muldoon relayed data that Saunders had obtained
from Stone to a division of Litton Industries Inc. and to Norden
Systems, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
   Muldoon gave Saunders $32,000 of the $96,000 he was paid by
Litton and $13,750 of the $27,500 that he received from Norden, the
indictment said.
   Stone is charged with using his influence to help Norden stay in
the competition for the lucrative contract.
   The indictment did not charge Stone with receiving any of the
money that Muldoon was paid, but it suggested he was paid for
keeping Norden in the running.
   The indictment recounted a wiretapped conversation during which
Stone allegedly told Saunders that Norden ``made the cut'' to be
one of the final four competitors for the contract.
   Stone was quoted as saying that keeping Norden in the
competition was not a waste of time ``if it puts, you know, bread
on the table.''
   The indictment quoted Stone as saying his efforts had been ``a
piece of cake'' and that he and Saunders were ``due.''
   Muldoon, convicted last December of bribing another Pentagon
procurement official, is also accused of trying to peddle the
information to LTV Corp., and Grumman Corp., which were also
competing for the contract to build a battlefield air traffic
control system.
   The three defendants also are accused of conspiring to pass
information about a separate contract to Unisys Corp.
   Three former Norden executives have pleaded guilty to
participating in the scheme to pay Muldoon for the inside
information on the contract selection process.
   No charges have been brought against Litton or any of its
employees.
   The three defendants were each charged with conspiracy, wire
fraud and conversion of government property. The charges against
each of the three carry a maximum sentence upon conviction of 45
years in prison.
   Muldoon was sentenced in February to 27 months in prison for his
December bribery conviction.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Helms Effort Asking Bush to Recognize Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-four Democrats helped Republican leaders
block a conservative senator's resolution urging President Bush to
immediately recognize Lithuania as independent from the Soviet
Union.
   The symbolic measure offered Wednesday night by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., urged Bush to swiftly name an ambassador to
Lithuania and to ask the breakaway government there to establish a
diplomatic mission in the United States.
   President Bush, speaking to reporters at a state dinner at the
White House on Wednesday night, was asked if he felt reassured
about how the Soviets were handling the Lithuanian situation.
   ``I am _ only because they restated their views on peaceful
resolution'' of the impasse, the president said. ``It is highly
complicated. I'm not suggesting it's easy, but I see no reason to
question what they've said.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the White House reacted ``with concern'' to
reports that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had ordered all
arms confiscated in the rebellious republic.
   Helms offered his non-binding ``sense of the Senate'' resolution
as an amendment to unrelated legislation before the chamber.
Despite White House objections to the measure, Republican Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas predicted it would pass.
   It failed on a 59-36 tally, with 44 Democrats _ resisting an
effort to tweak the administration _ joining Dole and 14 other
Republicans in voting against it. Twenty-seven Republicans and nine
Democrats voted for the resolution.
   Those who opposed the Helms resolution were not opposing
Lithuanian independence, but spoke against undermining Bush. The
president's reluctance to recognize the independence decree has
been widely interpreted as an attempt not to sour relations with
Moscow at a time Gorbachev faces a number of domestic political
problems.
   ``The matter should be left to the president,'' Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., said in support of Dole.
   ``All it can do is create mischief,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers of
Arkansas, one of the Democrats who helped defeat the proposal.
   Lithuania's parliament declared independence from the Soviet
Union on March 11 and its fledgling government has been seeking
recognition from other nations.
   Gorbachev, however, has declared the independence decree
illegal. Though Gorbachev has said he would not use force, Soviet
troops have been conducting exercises in the area, and Gorbachev on
Wednesday ordered Lithuanians to turn in their firearms.
   The White House has urged the Soviet Union not to use force
against the Lithuanian people and says it is closely monitoring
developments there.
   Lithuania was one of the provinces of the Russian Czar before
the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. It was able to establish its
independence, along with the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia
and Latvia, in the turmoil that followed the revolution. It
maintained its independence until the Soviet Army invaded the
country in 1940 and attached it to the Soviet Union.
   The United States never withdrew diplomatic recognition from the
1940 government. The White House has declined to recognize the
current government although it has urged Moscow to negotiate with
the Lithuanian people.

<HEAD>NEA Chief Opposes Federal Censorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration opposes federal
censorship of artworks that are subsidized by tax dollars, the head
of the government arts agency says.
   Federal art subsidies were intended ``to be free of political or
cultural or content-based restrictions,'' John E. Frohnmeyer,
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, told a
congressional panel Wednesday.
   That is why the administration's request to continue the NEA in
business for five more years contains no such restrictions, said
Frohnmayer, who has headed the agency since October.
   He told the House Education and Labor subcommittee on
postsecondary education that the restrictions were absent when the
arts endowment was created in 1965 and should stay out.
   But the NEA came under close scrutiny last year after it funded
a pair of controversial exhibits depicting work that could be
considered sacrilegious or obscene.
   Conservative lawmakers, as a result, succeeded in amending the
1990 funding bill for the NEA by ordering the head of the agency to
deny funding to work that depicts ``sadomasochism, homoeroticism,
the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex
acts.''
   The NEA was told to review its evaluation process as well. In
the meantime, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. and other critics contend
that the endowment has continued to finance art that violates those
standards.
   Helms asked the congressional General Accounting Office to
investigate whether the NEA is financing pornographic art.
   In requesting the probe, Helms said Frohnmayer may be sincere in
saying no NEA funds are being used to support obscene art.
   ``But the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency
independent of the NEA,'' the senator wrote.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., recently complained about an
art exhibit in Illinois that included a painting of Jesus Christ
injecting himself with heroin.
   Frohnmayer said the NEA is improving the system for evaluating
grants. The agency will develop a ``grid'' to assure that all
geographic areas are represented and that as many cultures as
possible are represented. The makeup of the evaluation panels also
will be diversified.
   Anne G. Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance
said she was pleased by Frohnmeyer's comments opposing censorship
but was cautious about whether the administration will succeed in
keeping NEA free of restrictions.
   ``I think it's a first step in what is going to be a prolonged
debate over the next six weeks,'' she said.
   Rohrabacher said the legislative proposal ignores mainstream
values.
   ``If he means by no content restrictions that NEA will continue
to fund art that attacks religion or is so sexually graphic that it
is contrary to the moral standards of the people, I think he's
forgetting the American people are his boss and not certain people
in the arts community,'' Rohrabacher said.
   ``We feel that the National Endowment for the Arts is completely
out of control,'' said a statement from the Eagle Forum, a
conservative group that wants to end NEA funding.
   Defenders of the NEA say only 10 ``images'' out of 1 million in
the agency's history have generated controversy. Put another way,
they say 25 grants out of 85,000 have caused trouble _ just a
fraction of a cent for each taxpayer.
   ``It's a small amount, but it's a big principle,'' Rohrabacher
countered.

<HEAD>New Study Says Oat Bran May Work If You Eat Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts are still unsure whether oatmeal will
make you live longer, but a new study suggests that to do much
good, you'll have to eat an awful lot of it.
   In theory, at least, the water-soluble fiber in oatmeal, oat
bran, psyllium and some other foods will lower the body's
cholesterol levels.
   This idea catapulted oat bran to become one of the hottest food
crazes of the 1980s, as bakers and brewers offered oat bran
doughnuts, oat bran potato chips, even oat bran beer.
   But even if it might do some good, a new study suggests that the
often mimuscule amount of oat bran in many of these products is
probably worthless.
   The latest study found that to noticably lower their
cholesterol, people had to eat two bowls of oat bran or three bowls
of oatmeal each day.
   And although their cholesterol levels dropped while eating this
much cereal, the study left open the possibility that they might
have benefitted simply because they were too full to eat bacon,
sausages and other high-fat foods.
   ``Whether it's fat substitution or not, oat bran or oatmeal
appears to lower cholesterol,'' said Dr. Michael Davidson of Rush
Medical College in Chicago.
   Oat bran's apparent powers were challenged recently by a study
conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. It found that
low-fiber wheat flour lowered cholesterol just as much as oat bran.
And both apparently worked because people ate less fat.
   In the latest study, conducted on 140 people, the Chicago
researchers directed by Davidson found that those who eat two bowls
of oat bran lower their cholesterol levels more than 9 percent;
three bowls of oatmeal seem to reduce it 7 percent.
   However, it was unclear how much the volunteers changed other
parts of their diet to offset their high daily consumption of
cereal.
   Dr. Richard Pasternak of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital said the
oat bran controversy continues. ``We are still asking: Does it or
doesn't it?''
   Davidson's study was presented Wednesday at a meeting of the
American College of Cardiology, along with a study of psyllium
conducted by Dr. Eleanor G. Levin of Kaiser Permanente Medical
Group in Santa Clara, Calif.
   She found that the psyllium-rich laxative Metamucil, taken twice
a day, seems to modestly lower cholesterol, even if people are
already eating low-fat food.
   ``I think it's an excellent adjunct to a prudent diet,'' she
said.
   Levin, a cardiologist, conducted the work while at George
Washington University Medical Center in Washington.
   In her study, 58 volunteers were randomly chosen to use either
Metamucil or identical-looking packets of unsoluble fiber. But
before they started, they went on the American Heart Association
diet and lowered their fat consumption to 25 percent of their daily
calories. This alone dropped their cholesterol levels 40 to 50
points.
   When they began using the powders, which are dissolved in water,
their cholesterol levels were still above 200, the amount
considered to be safe. Over 16 weeks, the cholesterol levels of
those using Metamucil dropped almost 6 percent, while those of the
comparison group were unchanged.
   ``With a little of this, a lot of people can avoid taking toxic
medications'' to bring down their cholesterol, Levin said. ``I
recommend it to all of my patients.''
   Dr. Thomas Kottke of the Mayo Clinic said the latest study
appeared to be well conducted.
   ``Unless there are non-obvious holes, it seems to be a
reasonable conclusion,'' he said.
   One drawback of using Metamucil and other kinds of fiber is
their effects on the digestive tract. In Levin's study,
participants complained of flatulence and loose stools.
   ``It takes getting use to,'' she said.

   The risk of strokes resulting from irregular
heart beats, which strike 75,000 Americans annually, can be cut in
half simply by taking a single aspirin tablet each day, according
to a study published today.
   These strokes are triggered by extremely rapid beating of the
atria, the heart's upper chambers, a condition called atrial
fibrillation. About 1.2 million have this abnormality, and until
now most have gone untreated.
   The researchers said they were amazed to find that aspirin,
already widely recommended to prevent heart attacks, can keep
people from getting this form of stroke.
   ``We are talking about a condition that probably causes 200
strokes a day. This is an important piece of news when you realize
that they may be prevented by something as simple as a daily
aspirin,'' said a co-author of the study, Dr. Jonathan L. Halperin
of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
   The strokes result when blood clots form inside the rapidly
beating heart chamber. If they move into the bloodstream, they can
travel to the brain, choking off the supply of blood.
   Until now, the only way to prevent these kinds of strokes was
regular use of the drug warfarin, a blood thinner that is a common
ingredient of rat poison.
   Although often used for severe atrial fibrillation caused by
damaged heart valves, many doctors are reluctant to prescribe the
medicine for milder cases because of the possibility of severe
bleeding.
   ``We need to change policy about how to treat this common
condition. We have found something substantial,'' said another
co-author, Dr. David C. Anderson of Hennepin County Medical Center
in Minneapolis.
   A stroke specialist who did not participate in the study said
the results mean that aspirin may be an alternative for people who
cannot take warfarin. But Dr. Louis Caplan of New England Medical
Center cautioned:
   ``The actual amount of the effect and whether it is superior to
warfarin and in which patients are unclear.''
   The aspirin findings were based on a comparison study conducted
on 1,244 people at 17 medical centers across the United States. A
preliminary report was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Earlier studies have suggested that aspirin can block the
formation of blood clots in the coronary arteries that feed the
heart muscle. But the clumps of blood that form inside the atria
were thought to result from a different clotting mechanism.
   ``There has never been a shred of evidence to suggest that
aspirin would be effective at preventing blood clots in the
chambers of the heart itself,'' said Halperin. ``It's amazing that
aspirin was able to reduce the incidence of stroke in these
patients. It was unpredicted and unexpected.''
   About 15 percent of the 500,000 strokes in the United States
each year occur in people with atrial fibrillation. Experts say
these strokes are often particularly damaging.
   In the study, people were randomly assigned to take aspirin,
warfarin or dummy placebos. The placebo part of the study was
stopped after a year because of a striking reduction in risk among
those getting either aspirin or warfarin.
   The study found that 3 percent of those taking aspirin suffered
either strokes or blockages in the blood supply to other parts of
the body, compared with 6 percent in the placebo group.
   Although some fear that aspirin use may cause strokes resulting
from uncontrolled bleeding in the brain, there was no increased
risk of this in those taking aspirin in the latest study.
   The study will continue for at least 18 months to determine
whether aspirin or warfarin works better.

   Small physical differences inside the brain may
help explain why some people are afflicted with the severe mental
illness of schizophrenia, a study says today.
   Several earlier studies have described what appear to be
differences in the brains of schizophrenics. But because the
abnormalities were so slight, experts were uncertain whether they
truly were unique to people with the mental disorder.
   The latest work tried to settle this question by comparing the
brains of 15 sets of identical twins. In each pair, one twin had
schizophrenia; the other did not.
   ``The chief finding of this study was that evidence of
anatomical changes in the brain was present in almost every twin
with schizophrenia,'' the researchers wrote.
   The differences were subtle. But in general, the hollow spaces
in the brain known as the cerebral ventricles were larger in the
schizophrenics' heads, and the hippocampus, a part of the brain
vital to memory, was smaller.
   Just how these differences are related to schizophrenia is
unclear. Indeed, scientists are unsure whether they might cause the
disease _ or somehow result from it.
   The latest findings were based on magnetic scans that take
cross-sectional pictures on the head. The work, conducted by Dr.
Richard L. Suddath and others from the National Institute of Mental
Health in Washington, was published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   Schizophrenia runs in families. But the new research suggests
that the cause may not be entirely genetic, because the twins are
genetically identical.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam of Beth
Israel Hospital in Boston said the latest work provides ``nearly
definitive evidence'' of structural differences in schizophrenics'
brains.
   People with schizophrenia have disturbances in thinking,
feelings and behavior. Often they make disconnected remarks,
believe they hear voices and complain that others are stealing
their thoughts.

<HEAD>Study Finds Fish Oil Lowers Blood Pressure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today confirms that adding fish oil to
diet appears to lower blood pressure a bit, but the benefits
disappear if people are already getting lots of fish in their daily
fare.
   The study, conducted on 156 men and women in Norway, is the
latest to delve into the claims of fish oil's apparent benefits on
the heart and circulatory system. It found that when people took
six grams of fish oil capsules a day, their blood pressure fell
about 3 percent.
   ``The results of this population-based intervention study
demonstrate that polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil lower
blood pressure in subjects with hypertension,'' the researchers
wrote.
   The study, conducted by Dr. Kaare H. Bonaa and colleagues at the
University of Tromso, was published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   The results were similar to a smaller study reported last year
by a team at Vanderbilt University.
   In the latest study, the volunteers' blood pressures averaged
about 144 over 95 when the project began. After 10 weeks of taking
fish oil besides their usual meals, the first number (the systolic
blood pressure) fell five points, and the second number (the
diastolic pressure) dropped three points.
   However, the fish oil did nothing for people who were already
eating fish three or more times a week. A comparison group took
corn oil supplements, and their blood pressures did not change,
either.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has forsworn the use of tanks
and troops to halt Lithuania's drive for independence, but the
Soviet president is not above using psychological weapons.
   Gorbachev on Wednesday ordered the people of the breakaway
Baltic republic to turn in all of their firearms within a week.
   He also instructed KGB border guards to tighten their watch over
the republic and told officials to reduce the number of visas
issued to foreigners seeking to visit the republic.
   The Lithuanians declared themselves independent on March 11 and
thus don't consider Gorbachev their president.
   Gorbachev repeatedly has said that under his reform policies,
Moscow no longer will use muscle to keep restive republics in the
Soviet fold.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze assured
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Moscow ``will not use
force in the Baltic republics. This is what I've been saying all
the time.''
   Using his strenghtened presidential powers, Gorbachev has been
gradually stepping up pressure on Lithuania, which this week began
establishing its own border guard.
   Wednesday's directive was the third move in less than a week to
try to prevent Lithuania from effectively establishing an
independent government and economy.
   On Friday, Gorbachev gave the Lithuanian leadership three days
to renounce their secessionist move. On Monday, the Soviet
government declared Lithuania may not open its own customs posts,
take over factories owned by Moscow ministries or issue its own
currency.
   Over the weekend, the Soviet military staged unannounced
maneuvers in and around Lithuania.
   Lithuanians nevertheless remained defiant, figuring Gorbachev
had no intention of taking military action but was instead seeking
to strengthen his hand for eventual bargaining on the terms of
secession.
   In the six months leading up to Lithuanian's declaration of
independence, Gorbachev tried reasoning, cajoling and even staking
his personal prestige with a visit to Lithuania in an effort to
halt the drive for independence.
   Each approach failed.
   Immediately after Lithuania declared it had restored the
independence lsot for forcible annexation in 1940, Gorbachev said
the issue would have to be settled by talks.
   He called Lithuania's move ``illegal and invalid,'' and the
Soviet Congress of People's Deputies authorized him to use his
presidential powers to bring Lithuania back in line.
   Gorbachev initially showed great reluctance to use force to
quell ethnic violence in the Caucasus republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   But two months ago, he sent soldiers into the Azerbaijan capital
of Baku to halt a series of attacks that left dozens of ethnic
Armenians dead.
   In contrast with the Caucasus, Lithuania's independence drive
has been peaceful.

<TEXT>
   Severe nausea among people taking the common
anti-cancer drug cisplatin can be largely controlled by an
experimental new medicine, research released today says.
   Two studies show that the medicine, called ondansetron,
dramatically reduces episodes of vomiting; and nausea that persists
is much less intense.
   Although many cancer medicines can cause nausea, cisplatin is
considered to be the worst. The bouts can be so severe that some
patients refuse to continue with treatment that could cure them.
Cisplatin is widely used to treat cancers of the ovaries,
testicles, bladder, head and neck.
   Two comparison studies on the new treatment were published in
today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In one study, Dr. Luigi X. Cubeddu of the University of North
Carolina, working with researchers in Venezuela, tested the
medicine on 28 cancer patients. Half received ondansetron, and the
rest got inactive saline injections.
   Eleven of the patients getting ondansetron had two or fewer
vomiting episodes in the 24 hours after their chemotherapy, and 13
of those in the comparison group had four or more.
   ``We conclude that ondansetron is an effective and safe agent
for controlling nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin
treatment,'' the doctors wrote.
   In the other study, a French team headed by Dr. Michel Marty of
St. Louis Hospital in Paris compared ondansetron with
metoclopramide, another anti-nausea medicine. In a study with 76
patients, they found that ondansetron was about twice as effective.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Steven M. Grunberg of the
University of Southern California said that ondansetron appears to
be valuable, adding:
   ``We have made great progress since the time when aggressive
sedation was the only treatment for chemotherapy-induced vomiting.
We still have a long way to go.''
   Ondanstron has already been approved for routine use in Great
Britain and France. Its maker, Glaxo, has applied to the Food and
Drug Administration for approval to sell it in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Prison authorities say a convicted burglar
swapped clothes with his visiting twin brother and escaped _
leaving the brother behind and in trouble with the law.
   Prison officers did not realize the wrong man was back in the
cells until an inmate pointed out a telltale tattoo.
   The 19-year-old twins both have their Christian names tattooed
on their necks.
   They managed to switch clothes Tuesday in a busy visiting area
at Cardiff prison, allowing Anthony Litton to escape.
   Now, Terry Litton is behind bars, accused of helping his brother
escape. Cardiff magistrates refused an application for bail and
ordered to appear in court again next week.
   ``The twins have always been pranksters _ but this time they
have gone too far. The police won't see the funny side of it,''
said their father Ken, 45, of Rhondda, Mid Glamorgan.
   ``It is an embarrassing situation,'' said prison governor Alan
Rawlson, who launched an immediate investigation into the mix-up.
   ``It is a very big room and at visiting time it is very busy _
although no part of it is actually out of sight of the officers.
   Anthony Litton, serving a two-year sentence for burglary, had
donned his brother's green bomber jacket, checked shirt and jeans,
before leaving the jail with relatives who were visiting other
prisoners.
   As well as ``Tony'' on the right side of his neck, he has
mushrooms and a Black Widow spider tattooed on his forearms.
   The twins' father said: ``We just can't understand why Tony
wanted to escape because he is due for parole soon.
   Their mother Ann, 40, added: ``In school they had to wear name
tags _ which they were always switching to confuse the teacher.
   ``I reckon the decision to escape must have been made on the
spur of the moment. I really hope all this doesn't land them both
in too much trouble.''

   The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Thursday recovered almost half its 1,800-point morning plunge but
failed to rise beyond the 30,000-point mark, while the dollar
closed sharply higher against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average was down 963.85 points, or
3.13 percent, ending a hectic day at 29,843.85. After losing
1,836.05 points, or 5.96 percent, to bottom out at 28,971.12 at the
end of the morning session, the index recouped more than 870 points
in afternoon trading.
   The dollar closed at 154.83 yen, up 1.18 yen from Tuesday's
close at 153.65 yen. The currency opened at 154.50 yen and ranged
between 154.50-155.45 yen.
   Dealers attributed the index's afternoon recovery to
large-scale, computer-linked arbitrage buyings, in which investors
sold futures and bought spot issues in an attempt to take profits
from price gaps between the two markets.
   The Tokyo stock market has fallen more than 20 percent since the
start of the year, including 2,773.1 points in three trading days
this week. There was no trading Wednesday due to a national holiday
in Japan.
   Afternoon trading was more active than the earlier session,
which was sober and subdued as the rush of sell orders met with
virually no buyers.
   Traders estimated the first section volume at 580 million
shares, compared to 180 million changed hands during morning
trading.
   Massive selling that sent the market's key index below the
29,000-point mark came mainly from institutional investors, dealers
said.
   Kazuto Aizawa, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities
Co., said many market players were discouraged by the yen's
weakness despite the Bank of Japan's 1 percentage point discount
rate hike earlier in the week.
   Also, institutional investors were selling to offset losses
ahead of closing their books for the fiscal year at the end of
March, he said.
   Aizawa said he could not foresee a recovery in the market
``unless the government takes some measure, because the loss is so
big.''
   Currency dealers said the dollar's surge followed a strong
showing in New York, where multiple factors, including escalating
tensions in the Soviet republic of Lithuania, were said to have
contributed to the U.S. currency's strength.
   Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union on
March 11, but the Soviets have termed the move illegal. Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev Wednesday ordered Lithuanians to turn
in their weapons.
   Investors often regard the dollar as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said many currency market
players had anticipated Tuesday's action by Japan's central bank to
raise its official discount rate by a full percentage point to 5.25
percent.

<HEAD>`Roaming Plane' Pilot Indicted on Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Root, the attorney who ditched his
plane in the Atlantic Ocean last summer, stands indicted on 33
counts of fraud and other crimes involving radio stations he was
representing before the Federal Communications Commission.
   The federal indictment returned Wednesday accuses Root of
defrauding the federal government and five clients in FCC
proceedings on permits to construct FM radio stations throughout
the United States.
   If convicted of all charges against him, Root, 37, would face a
maximum 200 years in prison and an $8 million fine.
   Root burst onto the public scene last July when his
single-engine plane ran out of gas and plunged into the Atlantic
off the Bahamas following a six-hour, 800-mile flight that began
near Washington, D.C.
   He told authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the
odyssey, but Navy fighter pilots flying alongside the plane
reported seeing him moving in the cockpit.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said a mysterious gunshot wound Root
suffered during the flight is part of an ongoing investigation.
   As Root was recovering from his ordeal, a series of financial
and legal questions began emerging. Less than a week after the
crash, Sonrise Management Services, a Columbus, Ga., company, sued
Root for $584,000. It claimed he failed to perform work and
double-billed a client.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October, claiming he had $1.64 million in liabilities. Reports
surfaced that Root's law practice was the subject a fraud
investigation before a federal grand jury.
   Stephens said Wednesday that Root had been aware of the probe,
which began in April 1989, before the flight that put him in the
public spotlight.
   The indictment charges Root with 20 counts of wire and mail
fraud, seven counts of filing false legal documents with the FCC,
four counts of using counterfeit and altered federal documents, and
one count each of forgery and obstruction of the grand jury's
investigation.

<HEAD>Study Bolsters Argument That Greenhouse Warming Has Begun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today that a key natural process
could not have produced the global warming of the past 100 years by
itself, supporting the idea that the greenhouse effect is already
raising global temperatures.
   Only about three-fifths of that warming could have come from a
natural long-term influence of the oceans, the researchers'
computer simulation suggests.
   The result is presented in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by T.M.L. Wigley and S.C.B. Raper of the University of East
Anglia in Norwich, England.
   They said the result does not prove that greenhouse warming has
begun. Other scientists agreed, but split on how strongly the
result bolsters the idea.
   The greenhouse effect refers to a warming caused by a buildup in
the atmosphere of certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, chiefly
from human activity. Scientists are concerned that it could
eventually alter climates and rainfall patterns and lead to coastal
flooding from raised ocean levels.
   But they disagree on whether the greenhouse effect has yet
produced any detectable impact.
   The Earth has warmed by about nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit
over the past 100 years.
   A major problem in demonstrating a role for the greenhouse
effect is that scientists do not know how much of the warming comes
from long-term natural variability, said Gerald Meehl of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   The oceans, which slowly absorb and release huge amounts of
heat, are probably the most likely source of this long-term
influence, he said.
   The simulation reported in the Nature paper found that over
intervals of up to 100 years, the oceans might produce a trend of
up to about half a degree Fahrenheit.
   That means the ocean influence could not have produced the
observed global warming by itself, the researchers wrote. Yet, ``we
still cannot claim to have unequivocally detected the greenhouse
effect,'' they said.
   Researcher Robert Cess said the study cannot rule out the idea
that the oceans did produce the global warming. The simulation was
too simplified to produce a firm conclusion, said Cess, an
atmospheric sciences professor at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook.
   But researcher Stephen Schneider of the atmospheric research
center, who called himself 80 percent certain that greenhouse
warming has begun, said the result adds to his belief.
   ``It's not proof yet,'' he said, but ``it's another step along
the way.''
   Scientists will need another 10 years to 20 years of
observations to be sure if they are seeing a greenhouse warming, he
said.

<HEAD>Public Citizen Sues Pfizer Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advocacy group is suing the maker of an
allegedly defective heart valve that has been implanted in the
chests of more than 80,000 people.
   Public Citizen said Wednesday its suit seeks to require Shiley
Inc. and its parent company, Pfizer Inc., to notify all those who
have had the valve implanted about alleged defects and possible
life-threatening consequences if it fails.
   The suit also asks that the companies pay for psychological
counseling and medical consultation to advise these people of the
risks and benefits of having the valve removed, the symptoms of
valve failure and emergency steps to be taken if those symptoms
occur.
   The group, founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader, filed the
lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Shiley's principal
offices are in California.
   Pfizer, based in New York, said the suit is ``completely without
merit'' and will ``frighten cardiac patients unnecessarily and
ultimately do much more harm than good.''
   Pfizer said the valves ``have saved the lives of tens of
thousands of patients. All but a small fraction of 1 percent of
these valves continue to function properly.''
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the valve in April
1979, but after reports of malfunctions, Shiley removed it from the
market in November 1986.
   The company has reported to the FDA nearly 400 failures of the
valve, 248 of which resulted in death.

<HEAD>Meatpacker to Pay OSHA Fine, Hire On-Job Injuries Consultant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Morrell &amp; Co., one of the nation's
largest meatpackers, has agreed to pay a fine of almost $1 million
and to try harder to protect its South Dakota workers from injuries.
   Labor Department officials said they hope the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration's settlement Wednesday with the
Cincinnati-based company will be a model for the rest of the meat
industry, where there are high incidences of repetitive strain
injuries.
   OSHA originally proposed $4.3 million in fines against Morrell
for exposing workers at its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant to hazards
that produced cumulative trauma disorders, or repetitive motion
injuries.
   Under Wednesday's settlement, which was also worked out with the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Morrell will pay a
$990,000 fine and provide a grant of $260,000 to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for the continuing
study of repetitive motion injuries.
   In addition, Morrell will retain a consultant for at least four
years to carry out its program to eliminate hazards.

<HEAD>INS Reports Surge in Apprehensions Over Past 10 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flow of illegal immigration across the
Southwest border appears to be increasing dramatically, reversing a
three-year downturn that began when the federal government made it
illegal to hire undocumented workers.
   Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said a surge in apprehensions of illegal aliens _
considered to be the best available indicator of illegal
immigration _ began in May 1989 and has continued steadily.
   According to the INS figures, apprehensions of illegal aliens
were up 29.9 percent over the past 10 months, compared with the
same period a year ago. Apprehensions totaled 801,937 between May
1989 and February 1990 compared with 617,317 apprehensions between
May 1988 and February 1989.
   Some months recorded surges of nearly 60 percent, while in other
months the increases dropped below 20 percent. But the past three
months have been among the highest, with apprehensions rising 57.3
percent between February 1989 and February 1990, by 39.6 percent
between January 1989 and January 1990, and by 58.3 between December
1988 and December 1989.
   Apprehensions began dropping sharply in fiscal 1987, the first
year after Congress passed the Immigration Control and Reform Act
of 1986, which made employers subject to civil and criminal
sanctions for hiring undocumented workers.
   Although the trend in apprehensions continued downward through
the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the first six months of
this fiscal year have seen an increase in apprehensions of 37
percent over the same period a year ago.
   Jervis said the rise in illegal immigration may be due to the
availability of fraudulent documents that undocumented workers use
to obtain work or simply the ``desperation'' of some in Mexico to
seek work here.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yves Saint Laurent had a winning through
abbreviated winter ready-to-wear show, winding up a big week of
fashion in elegant Paris style.
   While the 53-year-old ``king of fashion'' was recovering in a
hospital from exhaustion, the collection displayed Wednesday still
sparkled with his verve and talent.
   Assistants from the house would say only that he ``worked on the
collection until last Saturday, and now his doctor has prescribed a
long rest.''
   The clothes had the inimitable Saint Laurent touch. Many of the
current trends shown around town were Saint Laurent's own
inventions, and his latest versions were replayed in a modern key.
   The exuberantly flowered folklore reminded the audience that
Saint Laurent started the rich peasant styles now seen on runways
back in 1976. His black-piped quilted cotton jackets or flounced
flare-away coats were updated with a casual appeal for the 1990s.
   Saint Laurent also brought out some gorgeous multicolored
harlequin blouses, and sexily fitted velvet jackets with elaborate
embroidered appliques over full print short skirts with ruffled
underskirts.
   Then the pace changed with quietly sleek man-tailored taupe or
grey gabardine trouser or skirt suits as only Saint Laurent can do
them, giving feminine touches like dripping rhinestone brooches and
gold lame gloves.
   A new YSL couture accessory shop opens today at 32 Rue du
Faubourg Saint-Honore to offer such goodies, as well as bags and
scarves _ for couture prices, with bracelets starting around $250.
   Saint Laurent also took his fashions on a worldwide trip that
included a visit to the Scottish moors, with the most wonderful new
draped tartan kilts and tam o'shanters with dashing pheasant
feathers.
   There were Tyrolian maids in spiffy tweed suits with sparkling
buttons and velvet lapels, superb boleros decorated with big bands
of colorful rick-rack, and excellent hooded duffel coats.
   The most original duffel was in robin's egg blue, over a
pullover in pastel and white Norwegian motifs with stars, topping
straight gray flannel pants gathered at the waist.
   Like just about every other designer, Saint Laurent was inspired
by safari country. If you have a yen for a wild-animal print look
to YSL. His are absolutely extraordinary _ big patchwork patterns
in leopard spots and black-cream ``tachiste'' daubs on the lightest
chiffons, caressing the body in sexy puffs, sashes, ruffles and
wraps.
   The glory of the show was that it offered something for
everybody, from the sporting set to the showy cocktail crowd, with
all lengths of skirt and several cuts of pants.
   For those who like minis with a wink at the 1960s, Saint Laurent
brought out some great modern suede knee or thigh-high boots, some
with passementerie-banded tops.
   Saint Laurent's lingerie-inspired clothes included black lace
mini-camisoles topped by belted puffs of organza in hot colors.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poverty-stricken widow can keep the small home
her husband helped build for her 42 years ago, a lending company
has decided.
   Transamerica Financial Services Inc., which hired one of the
state's biggest law firms to try to seize Lennie Williams' home
earlier this year, gave up its fight Wednesday, lawyers for both
sides said.
   Company officials did not return calls seeking comment, and
their Phoenix law firm declined to discuss details of the case
without the company's permission.
   The woman's lawyers attributed the settlement proposal to
publicity stemming from an Associated Press report about her case.
   Mrs. Williams's mental state prevented her from understanding
much of the legal battle that surrounded her home, but she knew
enough at times to worry that someone was after it, according to
her attorneys.
   ``She was just completely relieved when we finally were able to
get it through to her that she was never going to have to worry
about someone taking her house again,'' attorney Douglas Erickson
said Wednesday. ``The property is free and clear.''
   Mrs. Williams, who supports herself on $438 a month, doesn't
remember that her husband died 12 years ago, or that she put up the
house, in a working-class Phoenix neighborhood, as security for a
loan taken out by her former son-in-law in 1987.
   The Transamerica loan officer who handled the transaction says
he doubts Mrs. Williams knew what she was doing. The son-in-law has
disappeared.
   Others who knew Mrs. Williams at the time, including a state
lawmaker and a doctor who was treating her, also have said they
doubted her competence, and Maricopa County Superior Court Judge
Alfred Rogers ruled earlier this year that it appeared the company
``knew or should have known'' that Mrs. Williams was incompetent
and was being defrauded.
   Transamerica was not persuaded. It pressed for trial and
demanded that Mrs. Williams make $499-a-month payments even though
Rogers was blocking the company from going ahead with foreclosure
on the home.
   Mrs. Williams and her legal guardian filed the suit to block the
company, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp.,
from foreclosing. The suit also sought to void her part of the
contract and win damages.
   The case had drawn extensive publicity in the Southwest after an
Associated Press story was published in area newspapers. A national
television program, ``Inside Edition,'' sent a crew to interview
Mrs. Williams on Wednesday.
   One of Transamerica's attorneys, Robert Miles, said earlier this
month that the company believed it was entitled to the property.
   A second lawyer, Tom Canham, said Wednesday that the company had
now determined it would be better to settle the case, and that
agreement not to seek foreclosure was part of an overall package.
   The case was the latest in a series involving consumer-loan
companies, and it came at a time when the collapse of many thrifts
has forced more middle-class borrowers to turn to them.
   In Arizona alone, ITT Financial Services paid $1.7 million to
settle one class-action lawsuit, and Household Finance Corp. paid
about $4 million to settle another. Transamerica Financial Services
has already offered to pay about $4 million to settle a
class-action lawsuit that accuses it of gouging poor and
middle-income borrowers.
   Loan-industry lobbyists have said Mrs. Williams' case must be an
aberration.
   But Bill Morris, director of litigation at Southern Arizona
Legal Aid in Tucson and chief architect of the class-action suits,
said the situation is believed to occur frequently.
   The $32,000 loan that Mrs. Williams signed for carried an
interest rate of nearly 18 percent plus 8 points in prepaid charges
and called for total payments of $89,820, or $499 a month over 15
years. Her home, which is less than 1,000 square feet and which her
husband helped build for her 42 years ago in a working-class
neighborhood, was appraised at $40,000.
   Sworn testimony shows it was Mrs. Williams' son-in-law, William
Smith, who wanted the money in the first place.
   Smith had married Mrs. Williams' daughter, Alma, but hadn't
lived with her for years, said Rachel Freeman, Mrs. Williams'
great-niece and legal guardian.
   Alma died early in 1987. Months later, Smith came around and
promised he would help fix Mrs. Williams' home, according to Ms.
Freeman.
   Instead, he allegedly took her to Transamerica, had her co-sign
a $32,000 loan and disappeared. Mrs. Williams' attorneys have
obtained a judgment against him, but it's of little value since
they don't know where he is.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In attacks political and civic
leaders blame on thugs angered by the shift from army to civilian
rule, marauding gunmen have killed at least 19 people this week,
officials and radio reports say.
   The victims included 11 members of a self-defense group hacked
to death in the town of Petit Goave, the birthplace of nationwide
demonstrations that forced Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril from power.
   In the capital of Port-au-Prince Wednesday, assailants killed at
least four people and wounded eight, according to the reports. The
wounded included five members of a self-defense unit shot by gunmen
in speeding cars.
   The Unity Assembly, the political and civic coalition that chose
provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot after Avril went into
exile last week, has urged the formation of self-defense units.
   There has been a dearth of police protection since Avril fled.
   The Unity Assembly said thugs and members of the
ill-disciplined, 6,000-man army _ the traditional power broker in
this impoverished Caribbean nation _ are angry at the military's
surrender of power to civilians.
   ``These acts of urban terrorism have been committed by
irreconcilable supporters of dictatorship,'' politician Rockefeller
Guerre said Wednesday. Others said the attacks were aimed at
destabilizing the civilian government.
   An official at the state hospital in Port-au-Prince said the
morgue received the bodies of two people shot before dawn
Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the hospital treated eight people _ including the five members of a
self-defense unit _ for bullet wounds.
   Privately owned Radio Haiti Inter said gunmen trying to hold up
a rice storehouse downtown killed security guard William Desir late
Wednesday and shot up the building before driving off and shooting
at passers-by.
   And it said fishermen in the seafront neighborhood of Carrefour
on Wednesday found the body of an unidentified, naked man with his
hands tied behind his back.
   The Roman Catholic station Radio Soleil, Radio Haiti Inter and
an independent source said 13 people, including 11 members of a
neighborhood self-defense group, were killed Tuesday in Petit
Goave, 50 miles southwest of the capital.
   Radio Haiti Inter said the 11 were hacked to death by a gang of
assailants while searching for the killers of an elderly couple who
were shot and disemboweled earlier in the day.
   On Tuesday night, 1,000 police at checkpoints in Port-au-Prince
searched private vehicles for weapons, state television said.
   A soldier was shot to death in the capital by unknown assailants
Monday, and eight nuns at a Roman Catholic girls' school were
beaten and injured by machete-wielding assailants who broke into
their compound on Sunday.
   Haiti has had five governments since a February 1986 popular
uprising forced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in France.
   All but the current government were dominated by the military.
   Avril was elevated to power 18 months ago in a coup by
rank-and-file soldiers who said they were outraged with
state-sanctioned murder and corruption.
   His resignation followed a week of nationwide demonstrations
sparked by the killing by the army of an 11-year-old girl on her
porch in Petit Goave.
   If the current government holds general elections as promised,
the next government will be the first chosen by the people since
Haiti declared independence from France in 1804.

   Marxist guerrillas claimed responsibility
for the attempted assassination of a retired air force chief who
helped lead the 1973 overthrow of leftist President Salvador
Allende.
   The shooting of Gustavo Leigh and a business partner Wednesday
was the first political attack since an elected, civilian
government replaced Gen. Augusto Pinochet after 16{ years of
right-wing military rule.
   Cabinet ministers, military officials and the Roman Catholic
Church condemned the shooting and swore not to let it or threats of
future attacks weaken the democracy that was reborn 11 days ago.
   Witnesses said two young men with handguns burst into the
fourth-floor offices of a real estate company run by Leigh and
another retired air force general, Enrique Ruiz, in Santiago's
wealthy Providencia neighborhood.
   The two fired point-blank at Leigh and Ruiz then fled, police
said.
   Leigh, 69, was hit in the face, chest, stomach and both arms, a
hospital report said. Late Wednesday, the hospital said he lost an
eye and was conscious, in critical but stable condition after five
hours of surgery.
   Ruiz was reported in serious condition.
   In telephone calls to local radio stations, a spokeswoman for a
maverick faction of the pro-Communist Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front, Chile's main guerrilla organization, claimed responsibility.
   The spokeswoman, who uses the name Mariela Vargas, called Leigh
``one of the cruelest ideologues behind the thousands of killings
committed during the dictatorship.'' She termed Ruiz ``an
accomplice.''
   She warned of future attacks _ ``We will continue to exercise
our right to popular justice.''
   Leigh commanded the air force during the bloody September 1973
coup, directing warplanes to bomb the presidential palace where
Allende was holed up. The elected civilian president, a Marxist,
died in the coup.
   Leigh, part of the subsequent four-man military junta led by
Pinochet, declared the military's mission was ``to cut out the
Marxist cancer'' from Chilean society. The armed forces began a
harsh campaign of anti-leftist repression.
   Pinochet fired Leigh in June 1978 after a series of policy
disagreements, and Leigh became a public critic of Pinochet and his
attempts to remain in power.
   Pinochet handed over power March 11 to an elected civilian
successor, President Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat backed
by a coalition of centrist and leftist parties.
   Aylwin canceled scheduled activities Wednesday to keep informed
about developments following the shooting.
   His interior minister, Enrique Krauss, called the shootings ``a
cowardly attack'' and promised an intensive investigation.
   Education Minister Ricardo Lagos said it was ``an attempt to
destabilize the institutional order.''
   Defense Minister Patricio Rojas pledged ``no provocation will
alter the democratic vocation of the Chilean people ... or the
stability that the government gives to democracy.''
   Air force commander Gen. Fernando Matthei called it ``an attack
against each and every member of the air force. ... It doesn't
contribute to the positive climate of the democratic process.''
   The attack came on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the
Chilean air force, and the institution had suspended all training
activities to celebrate the date.

   This order, like any other adopted by a foreign state that
pretends to claim sovereignty over Lithuania, has no legal power.
It could be enforced only by brutal military force, and if the
Soviet Union is willing to prolong the aggression of 1940 against
Lithuania. It's a pity that it continues the mistake of the Third
Congress of People's Deputies.
   It amounts to the claiming of non-existent and unjustified
sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and unarmed
neighbor. The Soviet Union has recognized as null and void the
secret protocol to the agreement between Stalin and Hitler,
condemned the policy of ultimatums and violation of international
law including the annexation of Lithuania, but now once again is
not able to give up the prize and restore justice.
   The ghost of Stalinism is walking in the Kremlin and the shadow
of it lies far to the west (over Lithuania). Tomorrow will show if
the world, which greets Lithuania and her desire for freedom, will
approve. We'll meet tomorrow, serene and united as we were before
facing previous threats.

   The U.S.S.R. president's decree on Extra Measures to Protect the
Rights of Soviet Citizens and the Sovereignty of the U.S.S.R. on
the territory of the Lithuanian S.S.R.
   Contrary to the resolution adopted by Congress of People's
Deputies of March 15, the Lithuanian Parliament and government
continue passing bills violating the rights of the Soviet citizens
and the sovereignity of the Soviet Union.
   In connection with this I decree:
   1) The U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, the executive bodies and
local councils of Lithuanian S.S.R., the law-enforcement organs are

Lithuanian S.S.R. are within the next seven days to hand in all
their weapons to the law-enforcement bodies for temporary keeping.
The U.S.S.R. Interior Ministry is to seize such weapons in cases of
refusal to turn them in. The Defense Ministry is to receive from
law-enforcement organs the weapons seized from citizens and ensure
their safekeeping.
   4) The Foreign Ministry and the Interior Ministry are to tighten

permission for foreigners to visit the Lithuanian S.S.R.
   The Interior Ministry and the U.S.S.R. Procurator's Office are
to take all essential measures to suppress violations by foreigners
staying in Lithuanian S.S.R. of the regulations concerning the stay
of foreign nationals all the way to their deportation in keeping

<HEAD>Rare Book Collection Seized From Home Rivals Libraries, Curator
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collection of thousands of rare books
and manuscripts worth up to $20 million seized from a home in
southeastern Iowa rivals many libraries, a university curator said.
   ``It was like walking into a very, very good rare-book store,''
said David Schoonover, curator of rare books at the University of
Iowa who was called in by the FBI to help with the investigation.
   The home's owner, Stephen Carrie Blumberg, 41, who lists his
address as St. Paul, Minn., was arrested at the house Tuesday and
charged with interstate transport of stolen property.
   The FBI Wednesday appealed to universities and libraries for
help in locating the owners of the estimated 11,000 publications
seized from the 14-room house in the community of Ottumwa.
   Authorities valued the collection at $10 million to $20 million,
and said the antiquities included a Bible published in 1568.
   FBI agent Dennis Aiken said the items were stolen from
universities and private collections across North America,
including Harvard University, the College of William and Mary, and
the University of Notre Dame.
   He said agents recovered a suitcase full of library stickers
bearing the names of numerous colleges and universities.
   Blumberg has been under investigation by numerous law
enforcement agencies for two years, said Aiken.
   The basis of the search of the house was a complaint that
manuscripts and books valued at $662,000 were missing from the
University of Oregon in Eugene, according to a federal affidavit
filed in Des Moines.
   Larry Holmquist, an FBI agent based in Omaha, Neb., said
inquiries about missing books should be made in writing to Charles
Lontor, the senior agent in charge of the Omaha FBI office.
   The FBI said the items would be transferred to a warehouse in
Des Moines for inventory and cataloging.
   Schoonover said Wednesday he's unsure how many books were in the
house or the total value.
   ``I do believe whoever brought them to the house was very clever
indeed,'' Schoonover said.
   He said if the house in Ottumwa were a library, it would be
considered a good one.
   ``They (the publications) were in very good condition. They were
carefully arranged by subject and category of authors,'' he said.
``I was astounded at the range and quality and number of books.''

<HEAD>Protesters Say Menem's Reform Plan Betrays His Political Backers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of members of President
Carlos Menem's governing party stopped work and marched to
Congress, accusing him of betraying his political roots by imposing
a drastic anti-inflation plan.
   ``Menem, You Cheated Us. Get Out,'' read an 82-foot-long banner
carried by employees of the state telephone company as about 60,000
people rallied outside Congress on Wednesday.
   The Peronist Party candidate was elected in May with the support
of organized labor after a campaign in which he made no mention of
the painful austerity program.
   The broad support of Wednesday's strike, which disrupted airline
flights, mail delivery, classes and other public services,
indicated growing difficulties for Menem to try to stop 12,000
percent inflation and more than four decades of economic decline.
   ``Today begins the first step in the struggle against the
privatizations and so-called restructuring of the state,'' Saul
Ubaldini, a leader of the General Labor Confederation, told the
crowd outside Congress.
   In trying to stop inflation, Menem has said he would sell the
airline, telephone, railroad and many other money-losing state
companies that were nationalized or created beginning with the
presidency of Juan Domingo Peron in 1946.
   ``Menem betrayed us. He betrayed the people and Peronism,'' said
Celina Morturi, 45, who works for the state gas company.
   The strike was carried out peacefully by 22 unions that
represent about 1.5 million state employees.
   The leader of the 22-union Coordinating Board, Victor de
Gennaro, said: ``We believe the Peronist government should listen
to the people whose support brought Carlos Menem to the
presidency.''
   Union leaders say the move to sell state enterprises, along with
spending cuts to balance the fiscal budget, will throw tens of
thousands of people out of work in an economy already beset by
inflation, recession and unemployment.
   The rally and march took place on a warm first day of fall in
this Southern Hemisphere nation of 32 million.
   Menem, 59, tried to avoid the strike, and an open break with
organized labor, by offering a modest increase in public wages and
doubling retirement pensions to about $80 a month.
   However, he said Tuesday: ``They can stage a thousand strikes,
but the economic plan is totally irreversible.''
   Government officials say they have no choice but to reduce the
budget because the printing of money by the Central Bank to finance
the deficit fuels inflation.
   For years, Argentina financed the fiscal deficit by borrowing
abroad, but it can no longer do that because it stopped repaying
its more than $60 billion foreign debt. It also sold bonds to
Argentines, who stopped buying them after the government froze
withdrawals from savings accounts in January.
   Argentines wary of their currency, which has lost 99 percent of
its value in the past year, have billions of U.S. dollars in
savings, including an estimated $50 billion invested overseas.
   Uncertainty about the economy has raised fears that the military
may again try to seize power, something it has done six times since
1930.
   Such fears were heightened further following the death Tuesday
of army chief Gen. Isidro Caceres after a heart attack. Caceres,
who was 55, had helped put down three mutinies since April 1987.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Plan To Try Vietnamese Youth Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese youth who spent four years in prison
after being illegally sentenced to 38 years in prison will be tried
again on robbery charges, Dallas County prosecutors say.
   The announcement Wednesday came only a week after the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Luan Van Hoang had been
illegally sentenced to an adult prison.
   The prosecutors' strategy potentially could expose the teen-ager
to three life sentences in prison.
   ``I think it's appropriate that he be held accountable, whether
it's in juvenile court or felony (adult) court, for the action he
committed, if he is adjudged guilty,'' said Janice Warder, chief of
the juvenile division of the Dallas County district attorney's
office.
   Luan, who records show was only 13 when he was convicted of
armed robbery in 1986, was sentenced by a Dallas jury to adult
prison after lying to police about his age. Luan said he told
officials that he was 17 to avoid return to a California juvenile
facility from which he had fled.
   The state's highest criminal court ruled March 14 that District
Judge Jack Hampton lacked jurisdiction because Luan was underage.
   Prosecutors say they planned to retry Luan not just on the case
that was thrown out but on three other robberies.
   In 1986, Luan agreed to a plea bargain for three 10-year
sentences only after a jury had sentenced him to 38 years on the
first robbery.
   Prosecutors said they were preparing to handle all four cases
together, which could result in three life sentences for Luan.
   But defense lawyer Bruce Anton questioned the legality of the
prosecution's plans.
   ``If the district attorney's office intends to have the other
three convictions voided, at this time I intend to contest that
matter,'' Anton said.
   Anton said he believes that state parole officials will release
Luan soon because the four years he has served probably have
discharged his concurrent 10-year sentences.
   Anton said he also doubts that prosecutors could prove their
contention that Luan was 16, not 13, at the time of the robbery and
retry him as an adult.

   An advertising firm has covered a
billboard after residents and town officials protested the gun ad
on it because of escalating violence in the Boston area.
   ``When you're finding dead bodies in the streets, to advertise
guns is awful,'' Norwood Selectman Thomas Riolo said. ``People
think it's bad taste.''
   The ad featured a single Browning shotgun stretched across the
billboard with the words ``ARMCO Gun Sales'' and several gun
manufacturers' names.
   Ackerley Communications Inc. announced Tuesday that it also was
removing similar billboards in Boston, Cambridge and Watertown. The
same advertisement will remain at Framingham, Worcester, Fitchburg
and Marlboro locations, because no complaints have been received
from those places.
   The advertisement was paid for by Armco Gun Sales and the gun
featured is one primarily used for shooting skeet, Armco manager
Harold Carter Jr. said.
   ``It's hard to understand how some of these billboards ... that
are sexually centered can run,'' he said, ``yet a skeet-gun used
for nothing more than shooting clay pigeons can't.''

<HEAD>Government Orders Review of `Birmingham Six' Bombing Convictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered a review of the
convictions of six men who claim police forced them to confess to
two Irish Republican Army bombings that killed 21 people in 1974.
   Home Secretary David Waddington said Wednesday he had asked
police to review points raised by lawyers for so-called Birmingham
Six.
   Their cause has been taken up by Amnesty International, the
Irish government and most recently by Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the
Roman Catholic primate of Ireland.
   Waddington previously had resisted calls to review the case, but
said Wednesday that his decision was based on new submissions from
attorneys.
   ``In the light of the outcome of those investigations I will
give further consideration to whether my intervention in the
convictions of the six men would be justified,'' Waddington said in
a written statement to the House of Commons.
   Asked at a news conference whether the inquiry centered on
allegations of police misconduct, Waddington said: ``I am not
prepared to go into detail as to what the various questions are.''
   He indicated the case would be referred to an appeal court if
the new investigation raised any questions about the convictions.
   Gareth Peirce, an attorney for the six, said she hoped
Waddington's decision would be ``the beginning of the end of the
ordeal of the men and their families.''
   All six were sentenced to life in prison in 1975 for the
bombings in Birmingham.
   In 1988, the Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions. Lord
Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, said at the time that ``the longer
this hearing has gone on, the more this court has been convinced
the jury was correct.''
   Pressure for a review of the Birmingham Six case grew in October
after a court set aside the convictions of four people for IRA
bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974.
   In that case, prosecutors admitted police had tampered with
documents relating to interrogations.
   Supporters of the Birmingham convicts have argued their
confessions contradict each other, police tampered with logs to
make statements appear consistent, forensic evidence was flawed and
no witness testified to seeing any of the men in the two pubs.
   The explosions on Nov. 21, 1974 at the Mulberry Bush and the
Tavern in the Town killed 21 people and injured 162, the most
deadly IRA attack in England.
   Waddington formally requested the new review from the West
Midlands police force, which developed the cases against the six:
Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny,
Gerry Hunter and Billy Power.
   Waddington said West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear had
delegated the actual investigation to the Devon and Cornwall force.
   The West Midlands force is itself under investigation. In
August, Dear suspended two detectives and reassigned all 53 other
members of the Serious Crime Squad. He acted following allegations,
supported by detailed technical evidence, that detectives had
falsified confessions since January 1986.
   Waddington's announcement came one week before the broadcast of
a documentary on the Birmingham bombings, which Granada Television
says will identify five other men as the bombers. One of those men
is said to be in prison and the other four are at large.

<HEAD>South African Leader Says World Accepts His Government's `Good
Faith'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
said today that Namibia's independence and reforms in South Africa
have shown the world his government is serious about ending
apartheid.
   De Klerk was present at ceremonies Wednesday when South Africa
relinquished control of Namibia after 75 years of colonial rule. He
also has met with numerous world leaders during his visit, the
latest sign that South Africa's international isolation has eased.
   ``South Africa's bona fides (good faith) is accepted,'' de Klerk
said this morning before returning to South Africa for talks with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``The international community in general now accepts that
drastic change is going to take place'' in South Africa, de Klerk
said.
   The South African president, who has initiated a series of
reforms since assuming power in August, held talks in Namibia with
the country's president, Sam Nujoma, U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze as
well as the presidents of six African nations and the foreign
ministers of several European countries.
   ``I informed the leaders with whom I met that our aim was a new
constitution in South Africa which will have the support of the
majority of all South Africans,'' de Klerk said. ``While white
domination should come to an end, care should be taken to avoid a
situation where one form of domination was replaced by another.''
   De Klerk wants the country's whites to share political power
with South Africa's 28 million blacks, but he opposes outright
black majority rule. He envisions some mechanism that would give
the country's 5 million whites veto power on major policy decisions.
   De Klerk said his talks went well with Nujoma, who led the
guerrilla movement that waged a 23-year war against South African
rule.
   ``There is a wish that we should remain good friends,'' de Klerk
said.
   He said the exact level of diplomatic relations between the two
countries remained to be worked out. South Africa has full
diplomatic relations with only one African country, Malawi, but has
trade missions in several others.
   De Klerk said the protracted civil wars in Angola and Mozambique
were discussed at his meetings with foreign leaders.
   In both those countries, leftist governments have been fighting
since the 1970s against rebel movements that were backed by South
Africa until a few years ago.
   Relations between South Africa and the governments of Angola and
Mozambique have improved recently, but heavy fighting persists in
both countries.
   There have been a series of meetings in Windhoek this week in an
attempt to arrange a cease-fire and peace talks between the warring
sides in Angola.
   The Soviets back the Angolan government while the United States
supplies an estimated $50 million in assistance to guerrilla leader
Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say Court Ruling Undermines Grand Jury Concept</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling letting grand jury witnesses disclose their testimony
undermines the centuries-old concept of a secret panel that
deciding es if criminal charges are warranted.
   ``It's another chink in the armor of the grand jury,'' said
Buddy Jacobs, head of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys
Association. ``We feel like the system's worked well enough to last
800 years.''
   But Mike Smith, the former news reporter who brought down
Florida's law barring disclosure of grand jury testimony, said
Wednesday's unanimous ruling will prevent prosecutors from abusing
the system.
   ``The grand jury itself is kind of an inquisition process,''
Smith said. ``If witnesses aren't allowed to say what they did or
heard in there, then you not only have an inquisition but an
inquisition operating in the dark.''
   The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court decision striking down
a law that prohibited grand jury witnesses from ever revealing
their testimony after the case ends. Fifteen other states have
similar laws.
   The ruling does not affect laws barring witnesses from revealing
the testimony while the grand jury investigation is in progress.
   ``The court did limit its ruling, and we're pleased with that,''
Jacobs said. ``They could have ruled that the testimony could be
made public during the investigation.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the state failed to prove that prosecutors' interests in secrecy
were enough to overcome a reporter's First Amendment rights.
   ``The potential for abuse of the Florida prohibition, through
its employment as a device to silence those who know of unlawful
conduct or irregularities on the part of public officials, is
apparent,'' Rehnquist wrote.
   Smith, now a National Guard sergeant at Fort Indiantown Gap in
Annville, Pa., was a reporter for the Charlotte Herald-News in 1986
when a grand jury in Charlotte County called him to testify about
stories he wrote alleging corruption in the sheriff's and state
attorneys' offices.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Smith said during his
testimony he noticed that prosecutors were directing the jury
foreman to take certain actions and controlled whether jurors would
hand down any indictments.
   ``The grand jury was not able to be the sword and the shield of
the law it was supposed to be,'' Smith said.
   After the investigation ended and no indictments were returned,
Smith wanted to publish a news story and possibly a book about the
case but was barred by law.
   A federal judge upheld the law when Smith challenged it, but it
was struck down by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the
state appealed.
   George Waas, the assistant attorney general who handled the
case, said allowing publication of completed grand jury proceedings
by witnesses could harm a future investigation that might occur if
more evidence came to light.
   ``There are instances where grand jury investigations are
concluded only to be picked up again years later,'' Waas said.
``It's quite possible that details about what occurred before the
jury might compromise the jury's ability to do its job.''
   Waas also said the Florida law, which had been on the books for
40 years, properly balanced the need for secret testimony and the
First Amendment.
   But the Supreme Court sided with Smith, who said the ruling
reduces the omnipotence of prosecutors in grand jury proceedings.
   ``The prosecutor basically did whatever he wanted to do. The
significance of this case is that he's lost a little bit of that
control,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Taiwan's Largest Student Demonstration Ends Peacefully</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's largest student
demonstration ended peacefully today when thousands of protesters
left a downtown park, agreeing to give President Lee Teng-hui a
chance to implement democratic reform.
   The weeklong sit-in had attracted as many as 6,000 students to
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park.
   ``We cherish the achievement of this movement. We will return to
the campus to continue our efforts,'' said student leader Fan Yun.
``We will give the governing Nationalist Party some time for the
reforms.''
   She said students across the island would form a coalition to
monitor the progress of the political and economic reforms that Lee
has vaguely promised.
   Applauding and shouting ``We Want Democratic Reforms,'' many of
the students gradually left the park early in the morning. About
100 stayed to clean up the square, which was filled with garbage
from the seven-day occupation.
   The protest was triggered by the election of Lee by the National
Assembly, which is dominated by elderly Nationalist politicians who
last faced election on the Chinese mainland more than four decades
ago.
   The assemblymen fled to Taiwan with the rest of the Nationalist
government after losing a civil war to the Communists in 1949. They
were frozen in office to support the Nationalist claim to still be
China's legitimate government.
   Students want the National Assembly to disband and for the
people to choose the president by direct ballot.
   In another development today, Presidential Advisor Li Yuan-zu,
66, was elected vice president by the assembly. He was the
hand-picked nominee of President Lee and was the only candidate.
   President Lee, who also is chairman of the ruling Nationalist
Party, was elected to six years in office on Wednesday and hourse
later met with 53 leaders of the student protesters.
   Lee told students he would accept any suggestions that will
benefit the nation. ``I will certainly do my utmost to solve all
problems,'' Lee said. ``But it takes time.''
   He has promised to convene an emergency conference before July
to discuss changing the country's political system in response to
widespread calls that Taiwanese have a greater say in choosing
their leaders.

   ``I'm rather interested in acquainting a broader variety of
professionals in the business of shaping cities with the broader
concerns of historic preservation,'' said J. Jackson Walter,
president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ``We
would like to preach beyond the choir.''
   A national conference beginning today in Pittsburgh is one of
the first attempts to link the common interests of preservationists
and planners, organizers said.
   Jerold S. Kayden, a visiting faculty member at the Lincoln
Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass., called the two-day
conference of historic preservationists and professional planners,
public officials and developers ``their debutante party.''
   ``Before, they were walking down the same aisle, but they didn't
recognize each other,'' he said.
   About 250 people _ from historic preservationists to land-use
attorneys _ are expected to attend the conference.
   Preservationists have joined the political process in ways they
traditionally were absent a decade ago, said Elizabeth Waters,
mayor of Charlottesville, Va.
   ``Historic preservation has moved much more toward community
planning and development,'' she said.
   Preservationists are traveling ``in pretty heavy company,''
Walter said.
   For example, he said, in President Bush's most recent budget
proposal, efforts to preserve America's heritage rate high on the
national agenda _ in the same realm as protecting the environment
and improving the infrastructure and transportation system.
   The conference also will focus on past successes and failures in
burgeoning suburban areas, many of which are turning into small
cities that are home to more than 60 percent of the nation's
offices.
   Sponsors decided to hold the conference in Pittsburgh because of
its renaissance from a economically depressed city to one of the
country's most livable, said Constance Beaumont, spokeswoman of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, D.C.
   ``There just seemed to be a lot of innovative things going on,''
Ms. Beaumont said. ``We thought it would be an interesting
laboratory.''
   One example of the result of little preservation or planning is
Tyson's Corner, Va., near Washington, D.C., where there is heavy
traffic with limited pedestrian areas, Walter said.

<HEAD>Tokyo Market Plunges Another 900 Points, Dollar Sharply Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
3.13 percent today, three days after the third-worst drop in its
history, and the yen fell sharply against the dollar.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell 963.85 points, ending a
hectic day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Today's drop put the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   During the morning session, a rush of sell orders met with
virtually no buyers, driving the index down 1,836.05 points, or
5.96 percent, by the lunch break.
   Monday's 1,353.20-point decline was the third biggest in
history. There was no trading Wednesday because of a national
holiday.
   Dealers blamed the market pessimism on the yen's continuing
depreciation against the dollar, despite this week's 1 percent rise
in Japan's official discount rate to 5.25 percent.
   Higher interest rates tend to boost currency values while
discouraging stock investors.
   The massive sell orders came mainly from institutional investors
who were desperate to offset earlier losses, dealers said.
   ``It seems investor uncertainty and pessimism, which has been
building over the past three months, suddenly emerged when the
Nikkei index broke the psychological 30,000-point barrier,'' said
Kenji Maeshiro, a stock analyst with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``The market pessimism intensified as the index fell,'' he said.
   The Nikkei index recovered somewhat in the afternoon as market
players decided it had fallen as much as it could for the day after
breaking the 29,000-point barrier, said Hisao Yasuda, a dealer with
Nikko Securities Co.
   ``We don't understand why the situation is this way,'' said
Yaruo Yamaguchi, president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.,
whose share price closed at $6,903, down $452 from Tuesday.
   ``NTT's performance has not weakened at all. It's not NTT's
stock price alone that is down. I think we are just in the middle
of a major current,'' he said.
   The market has not hit bottom, Maeshiro said, but ``the bottom
is almost here.''
   ``It took the market one year to gain 10,000 points, but it's
gone in only three months. It will take a while for the market to
recover,'' he said.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 580
million shares.
   Testifying before a parliamentary committee hearing, Bank of
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said the stock drop stemmed from the
Japanese currency's rapid decline, Kyodo News Service reported.
   He said it will take time for the effects of the discount rate
increase to emerge, and the increase in the key interest rate would
not have a serious adverse impact on the economy.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told the hearing that the
stock and currency markets were influencing each other, sending
both yen and stock values down. He said his ministry was monitoring
the markets ``with anguish.''
   Japan's main securities companies have temporarily stopped
underwriting new stock issues, bonds and warrants in an attempt to
support stock prices.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended the day at 154.83 yen, up
1.18 yen from Tuesday's close of 153.65 yen, despite repeated
dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan, currency traders said. The
U.S. currency opened at 154.50 yen and ranged between 154.50 yen
and 155.45 yen.
   Currency dealers blamed the yen's weakness on the stock market
drop.

<HEAD>Cosby Producers Asked For $100 Million Bonus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producers of ``The Cosby Show'' asked NBC for
a $100 million signing bonus to renew the top-ranked comedy series
for a seventh season, but have dropped their request to $25
million, a newspaper reported today.
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner have spent the past eight weeks in
negotiations with Brandon Tartikoff, entertainment chief for the
National Broadcasting Co., the Los Angeles Times reported.
   David Brokaw, a spokesman for Carsey-Werner, said it is ``the
company's policy not to comment on matters of this kind.''
   Tartikoff also declined to comment, but said money is the main
dispute in the final rounds of renewal negotiations.
   ``When you're talking about renewing the No. 1-rated show in
television, it's a question of how high you're willing to go. They
have one level and we have another level,'' Tartikoff said.
   He made the comments last week after presenting NBC's fall
development projects to advertisers.
   ``Cosby'' has reportedly earned $575 million so far for NBC, and
that amount is expected to increase substantially each year the
show is on the network, the newspaper said.
   The series is filmed in New York and centers around the Huxtable
family: an obstetrician, his wife and their five children.
   Sources close to the seesaw negotiations said they began
initially with Carsey-Werner asking for a $100 million signing
bonus, and NBC seeking a two-year renewal, the newspaper reported.
   The producers then countered with a request for a $75 million
bonus and a one-year renewal. They also wanted NBC to pay $1
million an episode to cover all ``direct costs'' associated with
the show, the Times reported.
   Carsey-Werner then considered dropping the bonus request, if the
network agreed to hike its license fee to $3 million per 30-minute
show, but NBC declined.
   More recent discussions have returned to the signing bonus
request, now reported at $25 million. The lower figure takes into
consideration network commitments to other Carsey-Werner programs.
   The producers still want NBC to pick up the $1 million cost to
make each episode.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher against all other major
currencies in moderate trading in Europe this morning.
   Gold prices were up slightly in European trading, but lower in
Hong Kong.
   With concerns about unrest in Lithuanian and Romania, investors
were turning to the dollar as a safe haven, dealers said.
   Traders said continued confusion over how long unification
between East and West Germany will take is discouraging interest in
the Deutsche mark.
   But the dollar is unlikely to rise much higher, dealers said,
with fears of another round of coordinated central bank
intervention.
   ``I can't see the dollar moving ahead much today,'' said Pat
Magill, head of corporate trading at Daiwa Bank Ltd., in London.
   The Bank of Japan intervened heavily to support the yen earlier
today but had little impact on the markets, traders said. There was
concern, however, that other central banks, like the West German
Bundesbank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, would join in to slow the
dollar's advance, they said.
   ``The charts are pointed to a bullish direction for the dollar,
but there's a lack of conviction for buying,'' said Manfred
Totzauer, senior trader at Citibank AG in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.18 yen to a closing 154.83 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _ 1.7123 West German marks, up from 1.7070
   _ 1.5205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5192
   _ 5.7720 French francs, up from 5.7575
   _ 1.9255 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9230
   _ 1,260.50 Italian lire, up from 1,257.25
   _ 1.1810 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1769
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.5952, compared with $1.5965 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $392.50 a troy ounce, up
from $391.75 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $392.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $392.10, up from $391.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 99 cents to close at a bid
$393.52.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.08 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.06.

<HEAD>Cold Front Dips Across Northern Plains; East Coast Stays Warm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front was moving across the northern Plains today,
threatening livestock with a blast of winter, while farmers in the
highlands of the Carolinas assessed extensive frost damage to
peaches and other early crops.
   A cold front pushed by strong northerly winds may drop
temperatures in northern North Dakota and Minnesota to 10 below by
late tonight. Snow was expected, with gusts reaching 45 mph likely
to leave drifts.
   Livestock stress is expected to reach the danger level in
eastern Wyoming late tonight and Friday, the National Weather
Service said.
   Freezing temperatures early Wednesday destroyed up to half of
the peach crop in South Carolina's Upstate and extension agents say
such early crops as tobacco, corn and watermelons also suffered
devastating blows.
   Growers blamed the damage on temperatures that dipped into the
low 20s just before dawn Wednesday. More frost was possible later
this week.
   Rain fell in South Dakota on Wednesday night ahead of the
developing storm front. A few thundershowers were also over western
Nebraska and northeastern Colorado.
   The Southwest was expected to bask under clear skies and
temperatures into the 80s and 90s, while showers were forecast for
Northwest.
   Rain fell in Minneapolis early today. Clear skies were expected
over much of the East, but showers were likely in New York, Vermont
and New Hampshire.
   Flood waters in the Florida panhandle from swollen Georgia and
Alabama rivers were expected to recede in some places today. But
some other rivers were not expected to crest until Friday or
Saturday.
   The high for the nation Wednesday was 98 degrees at Borrego
Springs and Palm Springs in California.

<HEAD>Gates on Iran-Soviet Border Opened after 73 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Azerbaijanis poured across a
bridge into Iran after the Soviet Union opened a frontier crossing
for the first time in 73 years, Iran's official Tehran Radio
reported.
   The people who crossed the Araks River bridge Wednesday were
Iran's first officially sanctioned visitors from the Soviet
republic under an agreement reached after violent demonstrations in
January over opening the border.
   The gates on the bridge swung open to mark the Iranian Moslem
new year of 1369, which started Wednesday, the radio said.
   Relatives from Iran and the Soviet Azerbaijani region of
Nakhichevan met at the crossing in the city of Jolfa, said the
report, monitored in Cyprus.
   ``Many of the people were ecstatic with joy, and warmly embraced
their relatives,'' Tehran radio said. It gave no figures for the
number of those crossing.
   The Iranians showered the arriving Soviet Moslems with gifts,
including flowers, sweets and beverages as well as the Koran, the
Moslem holy book.
   The radio said that an agreement between Tehran and Moscow
allowed for all residents living within 2{ miles of the border to
cross unimpeded.
   Nakhichevan is a mostly Moslem enclave surrounded by Soviet
Armenia but governed by mainly Moslem Azerbaijan.
   The border between Iran and the Soviet Union was shaken by
violence starting in December, when Moslems protesting its closure
tore down fences and burned border posts.
   The Tehran radio report indicated the bridge gates had been
closed since the 1917 Russian Revolution, although the Red Army did
not assert complete control over Azerbaijan until 1920.
   Last month, the Soviet Union and Iran signed an agreement to
allow citizens from either side to cross four times a year and
travel in designated territories for up to 15 days.
   The estimated 20 million Azerbaijanis in the Soviet Union and
Iran, mostly Shiite Moslems, share the same religion, language and
culture.

   High-profile works of art like those stolen from a
Boston museum are difficult to protect and unlikely to be
recovered, according to some European experts.
   Interpol, the international crime clearing house, says only 5
percent to 10 percent of the stolen artwork it tries to track is
recovered.
   The United States has requested help from the organization on
the theft Sunday at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, said
Elisabeth Gams, an Interpol inspector.
   Ms. Gams said it was too soon to guess the motive for the thefts
or what might happen to the works, which include paintings by
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet.
   ``If there is no (ransom) demand in the coming days, one could
suppose the paintings are with someone,'' she said, referring to a
theft by contract. ``But we can imagine everything. Works of such
value are unsalable.''
   Europe leads the world in stolen art works, with Italy then
France the prime victims, Ms. Gams said. The chief targets are
churches, then private collectors, followed by museums.
   Experts say everything from petty banditry to terrorism is
behind thefts.
   ``Every time it happens, we wonder what these people want to do
with those lovely paintings,'' said Margreet Kolkman, spokeswoman
for Amsterdam's renowned Rijksmuseum. ``The problem is they're
worthless and priceless at the same time.''
   Such artworks ``can't be sold anywhere. That's absolutely
impossible,'' she said. ``Probably some idiot wants to keep them in
his safe and sometimes cast a glance on them.''
   In 1988, the Dutch art world was hit by two spectacular thefts.
In June, three paintings, including a Van Gogh and a Cezanne, were
stolen from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum. In December, three Van
Goghs were stolen from the Kroller-Muller Museum in Otterlo.
   The first three paintings were recovered as they were about to
be sold to an undercover law enforcement agent. The Kroller-Muller
thieves demanded an undisclosed ransom, but the Van Goghs were
recovered after police set up a trap.
   Pictures can go underground for years, ``sleeping'' in police
parlance.
   Or, ``They pass through various hands on the black market until
they find a home with a fervent collector,'' Anthony Russell of
Scotland Yard's arts and antiques squad was quoted as telling The
Times newspaper. ``When these people see a picture they want, they
go after it, come what may. They want it for themselves and nothing
else matters.''
   Paintings stolen in Europe or the United States have been
recovered in Asia and the Middle East.
   Authorities do not exclude terrorism as a possible motive in art
thefts. In 1974, sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army stole
Vermeer's ``The Guitar Players,'' but the painting eventually was
recovered in a rural churchyard.
   Museum officials often feel helpless and say it is impossible to
adequately secure a public place such as a museum.
   ``We have the most sophisticated security,'' said Marianne de la
Fond, the assistant curator of the Marmottan Museum in Paris. Nine
impressionist paintings were stolen from the museum in 1985,
including Claude Monet's ``Impression Soleil Levant'' (Impression
Sunrise).
   ``It's like in a bank. If an armed person enters a public place,
there is nothing you can do,'' she said.
   The tactics used for the Marmottan theft were unique, Marianne
de la Fond noted, recalling that it was carried out in daylight by
five armed men.
   ``I have always believed that if a burglar wants to steal
something, he will. The more you arm yourself with sophisticated
devices, the more it becomes a challenge to thieves,'' said Philip
Rylands, curator of the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice.
   ``There are things against which you can't protect yourself,''
said Ms. Kolkman of the Rijksmuseum. ``A museum is a public
building, not a fort. We have to admit people. That's our
function.''

<HEAD>Havel Says Libya Received 1,000 Tons of Semtex Explosive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's former Communist rulers sold tons
of Semtex plastic explosives to Libya but its new non-Communist
government has stopped all such exports, President Vaclav Havel
said today.
   Havel, in Britain on an official visit, made his comments at a
news conference at the Czechoslovak Embassy.
   ``The past regime exported 1,000 tons to Libya,'' he said. ``If
you consider that it takes 200 grams (7 ounces) to blow up an
aircraft, this means world terrorism has enough Semtex to last for
150 years.''
   Semtex was used in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, killing all 259
on board and 11 people on the ground.
   ``We ceased exporting this explosive some time ago,'' Havel
said, speaking through a translator. He did not give a date or any
other details.
   The former dissident playwright said Tuesday that his country's
considerable arms industry would no longer sell weapons to
totalitarian regimes, but would continue to sell arms to
democracies.
   Czechoslovakia has long been a major arms manufacturer. It
produces hand grenades, automatic rifles, tanks and armored
personnel carriers, in addition to explosives.
   Published reports say that the export of such weapons and
components accounted for between one-quarter and one-half of
Czechoslovakia's foreign-exchange earnings. The nation, strapped
for hard currency, may find it difficult to stop the trade.
   Czechoslovakia, under the hard-line Communist regime of Milos
Jakes and Gustav Husak, found a market among nations too poor to
afford expensive Western weapons or those denied access for
political reasons.
   In addition to Libya, clients have included Angola, South Yemen
and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Havel stopped short of saying that Czechoslovakia would no
longer manufacture Semtex, but defended its production for peaceful
use.
   ``This is an industrial explosive necessary for various
industrial uses. It is not an explosive made especially for
terrorists,'' he said.
   But, ``now we want to mark Semtex so it will be detectable,'' he
added.
   Semtex is odorless and can be molded into any shape, making it
almost undetectable by conventional anti-terrorist devices.
   On Wednesday, the first day of his three-day visit, Havel had
lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, then had talks with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   He said they discussed the future of Europe and German
unification.
   ``I told her that the process of unification should be
understood as a sort of engine propelling the unification of the
whole of Europe,'' he said. ``No new European order can be built on
a permanent fear of any one nation.''

   Carmen ``Irish'' Fasanella first
outfitted the back of his Buick truck in 1919 with two planks that
served as benches to ferry Princeton University students to campus
from the local train station.
   Fasanella, 87, who retired in October after logging 68 years,
243 days as a cabby, was told last week by the Guinness Book of
World Records that he is the world's longest licensed taxi driver,
breaking the previous mark by more than a decade.
   The former record-holder, Francis Edward Kenyon of Manchester,
England, held his taxi license 57 years-plus, from 1924 to 1981.
   Fasanella has driven for Jimmy Stewart, Adlai Stevenson and F.
Scott Fitzgerald, but his favorite rider was Albert Einstein, who
lived in Princeton and worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies.
   The scientist enlisted the cabby as a sort of bodyguard for his
morning walks.
   ``He was a terrific guy and a wonderful, wonderful man,''
Fasanella said. ``People used to scare him half to death. People
would be riding up Mercer Street 40 or 50 mph, throw their breaks
on, jump out of the car and run towards him to get an autograph.
They used to scare the poor old man to death.''
   Fasanella said sometimes he would walk with Einstein, and
sometimes he would follow behind in his cab to ward off curiosity
seekers.

   Lord Rothschild, the millionaire banker and
decorated World War II intelligence agent, died Tuesday at age 79.
   His family declined to disclose the cause of death.
   Lord Rothschild was born Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild into
a famous family of German-Jewish coin collectors who founded a
banking dynasty.
   He succeeded his uncle as the 3rd Baron Rothschild in 1937,
taking his seat in the House of Lords, the non-elected upper
chamber of Parliament, as a member of the Labor Party.
   During World War II, Rothschild served as a senior officer with
MI5, the British counterespionage service.
   Responding to what he said were years of innuendo in the press,
Rothschild wrote The Daily Telegraph in 1986 urging MI5 to state
publicly that it had ``unequivocal evidence'' disproving rumors
that he was the ``fifth man'' in the infamous Soviet spy ring
formed by Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the government had no
evidence that Rothschild was ever a Soviet agent.

a heart attack at age 80.
   In 1948 and more than a decade before he took over what then was
a leading maker of aircraft engines, Berner led a group of
dissident stockholders seeking to oust the company's management.
   As head of the diversified aerospace components producer in the
late 1970s and early 80s, Berner waged an unsuccessful three-year
battle to control the Kennecott Copper Corp.
   The struggle ended in 1981 when both parties agreed that neither
one would try to take over the other for the next 10 years.
However, Kennecott came away with Curtiss-Wright's

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's new, vocal opposition
groups demanded today that the Communist government set up a
provisional legislature with equal representation from all parties
to oversee democratic elections.
   In several letters to the legislature, the Great People's Hural,
oppostion parties also demanded the government shut down the Marda
uranium mine, but Energy Minister Batkhuyag reported it had already
been closed.
   The mine in Eastern Mongolia produced 100,000 tons of uranium
last year for export to the Soviet Union, Batkhuyag said. Numerous
newspaper articles recently have clamored for it to shut down.
   Mongolia's only functioning Buddhist monastery, meanwhile,
petitioned the Great People's Hural to abolish government control
on religion.
   The demands were the latest by pro-democracy groups that sprang
up four months ago, modeling themselves after similar movements in
the Soviet bloc. Mongolia, sandwiched between the Soviet Union and
China, has been a Soviet satellite since 1921 and allows Red Army
soldiers to be based on its soil.
   The letters from Gandan monastery and the opposotion parties
were read to the Hural by J. Gurragchaa, a deputy who became
Mongolia's first cosmonaut when he served as a crew member in a
Soviet space mission in 1981.
   Opposition groups were allowed to send observers to the annual
Hural session for the first time ever, but they were not allowed to
speak.
   The Mongolian Democratic Association and its affiliate, the
Mongolian Democratic Party, are seeking legal guarantees that the
Communist Party won't end the country's latest political thaw. They
are also demanding legalization of opposition parties and a
provisional legislature.
   The Mongolian Democratic Association has suggested several
formulas for setting up such a legislature with the ruling
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party holding at most one-third of
the seats. Currently, the comunists account for 93 percent of the
Hural's 370 deputies.
   ``The main thing is for us to have our own vote there, but we
have little hope,'' Galsandorg, a lawyer and association member,
said earlier in the week.
   Several Hural deputies expressed concern in speeches today about
the proliferation of opposition groups and called for a law to
regulate them.
   ``I think Mongolia doesn't need so many meetings and political
forces,'' said Batzul, an elderly delegate from Western Mongolia.
   ``They press the (Communist) party and government and demand
things, and if these demands are not met they organize
demonstrations and hunger strikes. I am against that,'' said a
woman delegate, who won warm applause.
   ``Even families have leaders, and we must, too,'' she said.
   A military dlegate who spoke Wednesday nght also suggested laws
to regulate demonstrations and set conditions for imposing a state
of emergency.
   Another delegate, Zayat, said demonstrations have occurred in
rural areas as well as Ulan Bator, but gave no details.
   The opposition groups, especially the Mongolian Democratic
Association, say thay have set up branches nationwide, although
their bases are in the capital.
   The ruling party has replaced its top leadership and the Hural
elected a new president and prime minister on Wednesday as steps
toward reform. But opposition groups say more than personnel
changes are needed.
   The letter from Gandan monastery in Ulan Bator was the first
time Mongolia's tiny but influentual community of monks had called
for religious freedom. A few monks have joined opposition ralies
and they held a joint rally with the Mongolian Democratic
Association on March 11 at a former temple to demand its reopening.
   But so far, they have moved cautiously in asserting a political
role.
   Historically, Buddhist monks held great wealth and power in
Mongolia, but in the 1930s and 40s the Communists shut down
Mongolia's more than 700 monasteries and forced the monks, who
accounted for nearly half the male population, to take secular jobs.
   Gandan was allowed to reopen in 1944, but its fewer than 160
monks are not allowed to preach outaside monastery grounds.

   Marla Maples, the alleged other woman in the
ballyhooed breakup last month of Donald and Ivana Trump, has been
given the billionaire brush-off, according to a published report.
   Trump told Ms. Maples in a brief phone call Monday that it was
over, according to today's editions of the New York Post. The paper
said it got the information from ``a reliable source.''
   The source said Ms. Maples was ``totally'' devastated, sobbing
and begging the real estate tycoon not to abandon her, the
newspaper said.
   The Daily News reported that Trump told friends last week,
``She's on her own'' and that he didn't leave his wife to be tied
down, the paper said.
   ``What relationship between me and Marla? The fact that someone
happens to like me, that's her problem,'' the News quotes Trump as
saying to friends.
   The Post said Trump changed his private number so Ms. Maples can
no longer ring him at home, the Post said.
   Trump's spokesman did not comment on the reported breakup of the
alleged affair.
   A spokesman for Ms. Maples said there has been no change in the
relationship, which he said was never more than a friendship.
   ``He has not cut off communication,'' said Chuck Jones, the
spokesman. ``Some people are going to have egg on their face if
they say that.''
   Jones said Ms. Maples, an actress and model, has turned down
offers of up to $1 million from magazines to tell her story.

   Attackers shot and seriously wounded a

   It was the second attack on a presidential candidate in seven
months.
   Bernardo Jaramillo, candidate of the Patriotic Union, was shot
by two gunmen and rushed to a nearby clinic to undergo surgery,
party President Diego Montana told Caracol radio network.
   A spokeswoman at the clinic told Caracol that Jaramillo was in
serious condition, shot twice in the throat and twice in the
abdomen.
   Montana said one of Jaramillo's assailants was shot and killed
by bodyguards, but Caracol said that the man, identified as Jairo
Restrepo, 21, was only wounded. Police were searching for the other
gunman, Caracol said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting.
However, the Patriotic Union has been targeted by Colombian
right-wing death squads. Since the party's founding in 1984, 1,044
of its members have been assassinated.
   Drug traffickers were blamed for the August slaying of leading
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan of the governing Liberal
Party. The shooting prompted President Emilio Barco to launch a
crackdown on drug lords.
   The presidential election is May 26.

<TEXT>
   The political party that finished second in
East Germany's first free election said today it is ready to begin
talks with the winning conservatives on building a broad coalition
government.
   But the party, the Social Democrats, set an important condition
that could hinder the negotiations.
   Meanwhile, the winners of Sunday's parliamentary election, the
conservative Alliance for Germany led by the Christian Democrats,
said that it would carry out its campaign pledge and forge ahead
with quick reunification.
   The statement by the Social Democrats excluded any cooperation
with the German Social Union, the most right-wing of the three
parties in the Alliance for Germany, which also includes the
Democratic Awakening.
   A two-thirds majority in the new 400-seat Parliament is needed
to approve unification with West Germany, and the conservative
alliance needs the votes of the Social Democrats to assure passage.
   The Communists, who ruled the country for more than 40 years,
finished third in the balloting.
   Richard Schroeder, Social Democratic member of Parliament, read
a statement to reporters saying his party decided on the move to
negotiate ``in view of the serious problems of our country.''
   The party earlier this week rejected an offer by the
conservative alliance to form a governing coalition.
   No date was set for the start of the talks, which the Social
Democrats described as preliminary discussions to find out whether
there is enough common ground with the Christian Democrats to enter
formal coalition talks.
   A Christian Democratic spokesman quoted by the government-run
ADN news agency welcomed the decision.
   In Bonn today, leaders of the Alliance for Germany said the
three conservative parties will work closely in Parliament but
would not build a common bloc of deputies.
   This was seen as a formula that could leave the door open for
the Social Democrats to join in a coalition without formally having
to cooperate with the German Social Union.
   Lothar de Maiziere, head of East Germany's Christian Democrats,
met late Wednesday in Bonn with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany. Kohl backs the alliance and campaigned vigorously on its
behalf.
   De Maiziere denied allegations he collaborated with the
Communist secret police that was disbanded after the hard-line
Communist government of Erich Honecker was ousted in October amid
massive demonstrations.
   Concern is growing over whether the new, freely elected
Parliament is riddled with members who once cooperated with the
hated Stasi secret police.
   The West German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said today that
pro-democracy groups received an anonymous tip in January that de
Maiziere had collaborated with the secret police.
   The Christian Democratic Union had been a puppet party
maintained by the ousted Communist government, but it worked to
establish its independence after the peaceful revolution late last
year.
   De Maiziere became its leader after the revolution.

   A Filipino military general claims
the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency supported a coup attempt in
December that was put down with the help of American jets.
   The U.S. Embassy today denied the allegation, made by Brig. Gen.
Alejandro Galido in a sworn statement released Wednesday by the
Department of Justice.
   In his statement, Galido said an American who claimed to be an
Air Force colonel and the representative of the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency in the Philippines told him in July that his
agency ``favors the overthrow of the Aquino government and the
return of the Marcoses to the Philippines.''
   The Defense Intelligence Agency is an information gathering
division of the U.S. Department of Defense and Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   Galido said the American, Harold Magleo, promised ``to deliver
... shipments of firearms, ammunition, anti-tank missiles'' and
other weapons for the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt ``provided Marcos or
the loyalist group will give them $20 million for their group to
produce these war materials.''
   He also said U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt held a party at his
home in August during which conspirators received written
instructions from Filipino Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, who was held
at a military camp for involvement in a coup attempt in 1987.
   In its denial, the U.S. Embassy statement said there was no Col.
Magleo on its staff.
   Galido, former military commander in southern Luzon, said he was
aware of plans for the coup attempt, and he implicated numerous
military officers and civilians in the plot.
   He said Abenina suggested assassinating President Corazon
Aquino, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and the military chief of
staff, Gen. Renato de Villa. Abenina was arrested in January.
   ``The U.S. Embassy states categorically and absolutely that
press stories suggesting the U.S. government's involvement in the
December coup attempt are totally without foundation,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman Victoria Middleton.
   ``Any allegation that Ambassador Platt was somehow involved in
contacts with persons plotting against the government is totally
false and without foundation,'' she said. Platt was out of the
country and unavailable for comment.
   ``The United States demonstrated its support for President
Aquino and Philippine democracy during the coup attempt. That
support was absolutely firm then and continues to be firm today,''
Ms. Middleton said.
   She said the party at Platt's residence Aug. 16, 1989, was a
``normal diplomatic function'' and among those invited were Cabinet
and military officials, including Galido.
   The latest coup attempt was launched shortly after midnight on
Dec. 1, when thousands of mutineers attacked military and media
facilities, seized aircraft at Villamor Air Base and staged air
strikes on the presidential palace.
   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets from Clark Air Base flew air cover in
support of government forces and prevented the mutineers from
continuing their air strikes. At least 113 people were killed and
more than 600 injured before rebels surrendered their last
stronghold Dec. 9.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, said the government
would not comment on Galido's statement until a presidential
commission established to investigate the coup attempt submits its
final report.
   De Villa told reporters today the filing of the charges against
the alleged conspirators ``will eventually determine'' whether
Galido's report is credible.
   Asked why the government and the military, if previously warned
of the coup plot, appeared to have been caught off guard when the
mutineers struck, de Villa said: ``We did not know the time.''
   He said the Galido's statement of U.S. involvement is ``an
allegation that has to be looked into,'' and which the military is
``certainly'' investigating.
   ``There are many Americans here in the Philippines,'' de Villa
said. ``There are Americans who come and go.''
   Defense Undersecretary Leonardo Quisumbing said other military
officers gave statements that supported Galido's allegations.
   ``I am saying that we have witnesses, including officers, to
that effect,'' Quisumbing said. ``Well, in effect that there were
others involved. As it is now coming out in the sworn statement,
they involve some foreigners.''
   Quisumbing noted that Galido ``did not involve the entire U.S.
government,'' only the Defense Intelligence Agency and a certain
American officer.

   When Charles Stuart's claim that a black
man killed his wife and wounded him as they sat in their car in
Boston turned out to be an apparent hoax, it sounded familiar in
the Atlanta suburb of Marietta.
   Police here, too, were in the midst of a case of murder pinned
on a black _ and non-existent _ scapegoat.
   Neva Veitch told police two black men abducted her and her
husband, Bobby Joe Veitch, from a motel bar the night of Nov. 20,
1987, shot her husband to death and attacked her.
   Police made composite drawings of the alleged killers and
interviewed more than 20 suspects. But authorities made no arrests
and declared the case inactive.
   Then, in November, David Lee Craig, leader of a Ku Klux Klan
splinter group, walked into the police station and said Mrs.
Veitch, his mistress at the time of the slaying, was the true
culprit.
   But when Craig taped telephone calls to her for police, she
implicated him, his lawyer says, and a grand jury indicted both of
them on murder charges.
   Testimony in Craig's trial began Wednesday in Cobb County
Superior Court and is expected to last through the week. Mrs.
Veitch's trial will come later.
   In Boston, police apparently had accepted at face value the
story Stuart called in on his car phone on Oct. 23: that he and his
pregnant wife had been shot by a black man who jumped in their car
and robbed them after they left a birthing class.
   Police reportedly closed in on a black man, William Bennett, as
the lead suspect until Jan. 3, when Stuart's brother, Matthew, told
police Charles had plotted to kill his wife, collect insurance and
blame the killing on blacks.
   The next day, Charles Stuart jumped to his death from a bridge.
   Police now speculate that Stuart shot himself and his wife and
that his brother took the gun and threw it into a river, where it
was recovered. The brother, who has not been charged, said he went
to police because he feared Bennett would go to jail.
   ``Both the Boston and Atlanta cases played on racial
stereotypes,'' says Derrick Bell, a Harvard University law
professor. ``We cannot ignore the fact there is a lot of black
crime in cities like Atlanta. What (their story) did was play on
that fear of black crime.''
   Robert Friedmann, criminal justice professor at Georgia State
University, said Craig and Mrs. Veitch ``knew the media and the
public are fascinated with a fear of crime, particularly
black-on-white crime.''
   District Attorney Thomas Charron accused Craig and Mrs. Veitch
of ``preying on prejudice.'' He acknowledged similarities with the
Stuart case.
   Charron called the Veitch case ``a classic love triangle'' _
Billy Veitch a truck driver and often away from home, Craig and
Mrs. Veitch falling in love through his Klan splinter group. Craig
was imperial wizard of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan; she
was the group's secretary-treasurer.
   ``David and Neva were in love and they agreed that Billy Veitch
had to be killed,'' Charron told the jury in Craig's trial.
   Mrs. Veitch initially told police she and her husband were
abducted at a motel bar at gunpoint by two blacks and taken to an
isolated warehouse district, where the two told her they were going
to rape her and make her husband watch.
   She said her husband lunged at them, and she closed her eyes and
heard three shots. Her husband lay on the ground, bleeding from
back wounds.
   After that, she said, they drove her away, beating her with a
flashlight. She said one of them sodomized her before she escaped,
ran to an all-night diner and called police, who found her beaten
and bloodied.
   In November, however, Craig told Cobb County Police
investigators there had been no black men. Mrs. Veitch, he said,
was the killer, and he offered to help prove it.
   But Mrs. Veitch implicated Craig in taped telephone
conversations, said Craig's court-appointed defense lawyer, Ronnie
Knighton.
   Knighton denied that his client had anything to do with the
killing.
   He said she had asked Craig on previous occasions to kill her
husband but he refused. Knighton claimed Mrs. Veitch rejected the
idea of getting a divorce to marry Craig because she wanted her
husband's insurance money.
   Craig, who also was married, left his family and moved in with
Mrs. Veitch soon after the killing. He said he went to police
because she had a new boyfriend and he feared for his own life. He
said he had been shot at twice.
   Mrs. Veitch's attorney has asked that she be tested to determine
if she is mentally competent to stand trial and has indicated he
may use an insanity defense, the Journal and Constitution of
Atlanta reported Sunday. The paper did not name the attorney.

<TEXT>
   A West German businessman was charged
today with helping to build a plant in Libya that was suspected of
producing chemical weapons before it was damaged in a fire earlier
this month.
   The indictment against Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, former head
of the Imhausen-Chemie chemical company, charged him with violating
West Germany's export laws and tax evasion.
   Also today, a West German official said Libya cut off trade with
West Germany after accusing it of setting fire to the chemical
plant.
   West Germany made a formal protest today to the Tripoli
government, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Prosecutor Peter Wechsung charged that Hippenstiel-Inhausen
played a ``decisive role'' in the planning and construction of the
chemical complex in Rabta, Libya, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli.
   Wechsung said Hippenstiel-Inhausen shipped to Libya ``documents
on production'' as well as ``measuring and regulating instruments''
to be used by the chemical complex. He said investigators had
concluded that the Libyan plant was ``solely intended'' for the
production of poison gases.
   Wechsung also disclosed that West Germany's federal police had
created a special ``Rabta'' unit consisting of 20 officials who
took part in the investigation. Speaking to reporters in Mannheim,
Wechsung said about 3,000 files containing documents, plans and
other material had been confiscated in the investigation and that
statements were taken from more than 200 witnesses.
   Wechsung did not say whether other arrests were expected.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen stepped down as head of the company in
March and was arrested on Oct. 5.
   A number of West German companies were raided a little more than
a year ago after U.S. charges that German firms had helped build
the plant. However, only Hippenstiel-Imhausen has been arrested.
   Relations between Bonn and Tripoli have badly soured since Libya
alleged that West Germany and the United States had a hand in the
March 14 fire at the Rabta plant, which U.S. officials charge
produced poison gas.
   Washington and Bonn have denied Libya's allegations, and Libya
says the plant produces pharmaceuticals.
   Before the fire, West Germany had launched an international
initiative to find a way to keep the plant from producing chemical
weapons.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, had
proposed putting together an international team to inspect the
plant.
   The Bonn government official said Libya barred a ship carrying
Libyan oil to proceed to its destination in West Germany and
stopped payments to West German companies doing business in the
North African nation.
   ``I don't know the amount of money involved,'' said the
official, who gave no further details.
   On Tuesday, West German Ambassador Joerg Helmer went to the
Libyan Foreign Office in Tripoli ``to express our displeasure''
with the Libyan actions regarding trade, said the Bonn government
official.
   The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, quoting government
officials, reported Libya has ``blocked trade with the West Germany
since last week.''
   West Germany is one of Libya's major trading partners. Libyan
exports to West Germany last year amounted to $1.85 billion, most
of it oil. West German exports to Libya last year were valued at
$780 million.
   West German government officials say it appears Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi has decided to single out West Germany because of
Bonn's public pronouncements against the plant in Rabta, and
Genscher's international initiative aimed at keeping the factory
from making poison gas.
   The Rabta plant caused a scandal in West Germany a little more
than a year ago, after the United States alleged German firms
helped build it.
   West Germany at first denied the U.S. claims, but later
acknowledged them and launched its own investigations. The main
company under investigation is Imhausen-Chemie of the southern West
German town of Lahr.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen stepped down as head of the company
last March and was arrested on Oct. 5. He remains in investigative
custody.
   Since the scandal, West Germany has taken steps to crack down on
companies or individuals that violate export regulations, and
beefed up its export laws.

   One year after the nation's worst oil spill
hit Alaskan waters, many U.S. coastal areas face similar threats
and need tighter standards for tankers, pilots and tug escorts, two
environmental groups said today.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Marine
Conservation said in independently prepared reports that there are
many measures not now employed that would help prevent such
disasters.
   ``We have the know-how to prevent accidents before they happen,
especially in our most sensitive waters,'' said Roger McManus,
president of the Center for Marine Conservation.
   The studies were undertaken after the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground and spewed more than 11 million gallons of toxic crude oil
into Prince William Sound one year ago Saturday.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council analyzed three of the
nation's busiest ports _ San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles _
each of which handles at least 1,000 tanker visits each year.
   Among the principal recommendations in the two reports are:
   _ Requiring oil tankers and barges to have double hulls and
double bottoms.
   _ Requiring tug escorts for tankers in difficult waters and
biologically sensitive areas.
   _ Establishing tanker-free zones in environmentally vulnerable
areas.
   _ Requiring licensed pilots for all tankers and barges over a
minimum size within harbors.
   The groups also recommended that the federal government take
responsibility immediately for cleanup of major spills and that
contingency plans be drawn up to prepare for the worst spill that
could happen.
   ``To date Exxon has spent more than $2 billion when a fraction
of that would have prevented not only the disaster at Prince
William Sound, but the succeeding spills and groundings in New
York, the Florida Keys, Houston, and California's Huntington
Beach,'' McManus said.
   The Center for Marine Conservation report urged that the Coast
Guard control traffic within 15 miles of the Florida Keys, where a
series of vessel groundings late last year extensively damaged
coral reefs. It said tankers should avoid certain areas along the
California coast to protect sensitive wildlife and ecosystems, such
as sea birds, kelp beds, sea otters and other marine mammals.
   In a news conference on Wednesday, wildlife experts said they
learned much after the Alaska spill, but still don't have the
facilities they will need when more such spills occur.
   ``If there is an oil spill tomorrow, we really aren't that much
further ahead in advanced planning than we were a year ago,'' said
Randall Davis, co-director of International Wildlife Research in
San Diego.
   ``Certainly it will happen again in some form,'' said Jay
Holcomb, director of the International Bird Rescue Research Center
in Berkeley, Calif. ``Oil spills never seem to stop.''
   Davis was in charge of efforts to rescue sea otters and other
marine mammals after the Exxon Valdez spill a year ago Saturday and
Holcomb led the effort to rescue birds.
   They appeared together at a luncheon Wednesday at which the
Izaak Walton League of America, one of the nation's oldest
conservation groups, presented an award to Procter &amp; Gamble for the
company's support of the wildlife rescue efforts.
   ``I never want to experience what I saw when we first took our
boats out in Alaska, to find birds in a foot deep of oil with their
heads sticking out, yelling, and otters crying on the rocks because
they were covered in oil and were already suffering from the
ingestion problems,'' Holcomb said.
   Davis said, ``Even today we really don't have any permanent
facility nor any permanent organization to respond to another oil
spill if it should occur, with regards to treating marine mammals.''
   Both said they learned valuable lessons from the Alaska
experience, however.
   ``We had never been able to work with some of the species, such
as the horned and tufted puffins, beautiful yet nasty birds,''
Holcomb said. ``We handled 200 or 300 and released quite a few. We
learned some new techniques.''
   Davis said the Alaska accident was ``the first spill to ever
involve large numbers of marine mammals and sea otters in
particular. We learned a tremendous amount working on that spill.''

<TEXT>
   A team of Indian scientists has induced bamboo
plants to flower in the laboratory, a first for one of the world's
most important timber and fodder crops.
   The breakthrough promises to pave the way for improved breeding
of bamboo stock and provide a perennial source of bamboo seed,
according to an article published today in the journal Nature.
   ``It's a breakthrough that could have real significance for a
quarter of the world's population,'' David Hanke, a Cambridge
University botanist, told The New York Times.
   Throughout the tropics, bamboo is a vital source of lightweight,
rot-resistant wood for houses and furniture. It even provides
scaffolding used in building skyscrapers and supertankers.
   Domestic uses include tools, baskets, musical instruments and
pulp for paper. Bamboo hay has up to four times the protein of
other fodder grasses, and is a staple for livestock.
   The versatile plant's reproductive quirks make it a difficult
plant to grow and harvest.
   Most of the over 500 species of bamboo flower only once in their
lifetimes, between the ages of 12 to 120 years. A bamboo thicket
flowers simultaneously _ and then dies, leaving behind a thick
carpet of seeds.
   To insure a dependable supply of seeds, A.F. Mascarenhas and two
colleagues at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, India,
suspended tiny cuttings of bamboo in a test tube cocktail of
coconut milk, plant growth hormones and other nutrients.
   After two more applications of the cocktail and a few weeks,
adult-size flowers began blooming.
   The researchers have yet to plant the seeds, but expect them to
be viable.

<TEXT>
   Opposition politicans boycotted the
opening session of the federal legislature today, charging that a
legal technicality had ended Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's term
in office.
   Members of Ms. Bhutto's party said the opposition would have to
go to court to try to unseat her.
   Only eight lawmakers took their seats on the opposition bench
and demanded that Ms. Bhutto face re-election among the members of
the National Assembly, the lower lawmaking house of Pakistan's
Parliament.
   ``We regret we cannot participate (in this session),'' said
Abida Hussein, an influential member of the 16 mainly right-wing
parties that make up the alliance known as the Combined Opposition
Parties.
   The opposition's demand centers around a clause in Pakistan's
Constitution that empowered the president to appoint the prime
minister. That clause expired Tuesday, and opposition leaders
contend Ms. Bhutto must be re-elected by secret ballot in the
237-member assembly.
   Ms. Bhutto so far has ignored the demand.
   Newspaper reports had speculated she might call for a vote of
confidence in her 16-month-old government when the assembly
convened. But Tariq Rahim, the parliamentary affairs minister,
dismissed the suggestion and called the boycott ``totally
unjustified.''
   ``This parliament was eleced for five years and God willing this
Parliament will complete its tenure,'' Rahim said in a stern
response. ``If you have any questions about the constitution, go to
court.''
   The prime minister listened to the arguments from the house
leader's chair at the front of the dark wood chamber but made no
comment.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party controls about 111 seats in
the National Assembly but rules mainly with the help of smaller
parties and independents. The combined opposition parties have 86
seats.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning government has been buffetted by
charges of corruption and inaction on a host of social and economic
problems that grew under a decade of martial law. She narrowly
survived a no-confidence vote put forward in November by the
opposition.
   But supporters say her troubles with the Islamic and nationalist
opposition parties are behind her, pointing to a show-of-strength
rally Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore, the heartland of the
opposition. Others contend Ms. Bhutto only looks stronger because
the opposition is divided and weaker.
   The 36-year-old prime minister was appointed to a five-year term
by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan after her party captured the most
seats in the November 1988 parliamentary elections.
   But the president's constitutional authority to appoint
Pakistan's prime minister expired Tuesday, and opposition
politicians have been arguing for months that Ms. Bhutto must be
re-elected by a secret National Assembly ballot.
   ``We believe she is no longer the prime minister. She has no
power to convene the house so any session would be illegal,'' said
Shaukat Abassi, spokesman for the Combined Opposition Parties.
   Opposition leaders claimed Ms. Bhutto convened the assembly to
deliberately spoil preparations for their show-of-strength rally on
Friday in Lahore.

<TEXT>
   An attorney for Imelda Marcos said the
Philippine government is trying to turn Americans against his
client, who is being tried on fraud charges involving $325 million.
   The lawyer, Gerry Spence, gave the judge on Wednesday what he
said were documents describing Philippine government lobbyists'
efforts ``to instill bias and prejudice'' in this country against
the former Philippine first lady.
   Judge John F. Keenan said he would examine the papers but
expressed doubt about their relevance to the trial.
   Twenty-one prospective jurors were selected Wednesday for the
trial of Mrs. Marcos and Saudi Arabian financier Adnan M.
Khashoggi, who is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of
justice.
   The Philippine government, through a New York public relations
firm, released on Wednesday the text of a letter from Mrs. Marcos
to President Bush, sent March 5.
   The letter asked for Bush's help to assure that money and
property that she said her late husband intended for the Filipino
people be turned over to an independent five-member commission.
   ``Your government has publicly lamented the gross corruption,
the widespread irresponsibility and fragile hold on power of the
Aquino government,'' Mrs. Marcos wrote.
   ``Therefore you must understand my own apprehension over any
agreement by which this property would be given over to the
possession of that government since the likelihood of it ever
reaching our people is little or nothing.''
   Mrs. Marcos also asked that Bush help arrange for her husband's
body to be returned home.
   Copies of the letter also went to former President Reagan and
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The White House said Tuesday that Bush would not respond to the
letter during the trial.
   Keenan resumed his screening of jurors today. The judge has said
he expects the preliminary winnowing of prospective jurors to take
about a week.
   The 54-year-old Khashoggi, once described as the world's richest
man, is accused of helping the late Philippines President Ferdinand
E. Marcos and his wife conceal a series of New York real estate
deals allegedly financed in part with money stolen from the
country's treasury.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, has denied that she took part in an illegal
transfer of more than $160 million from the Manila government and
the defrauding of banking institutions of another $165 million.
   Marcos also was named in the original October 1988 indictment
but died in Hawaii on Sept. 28.
   Khashoggi said Wednesday that the jury selection process gives
him a chance to meet ordinary citizens.
   ``I think it is a good way to get to know the American people,''
Khashoggi said during a break at U.S. District Court.

   The first 12 games of the tournament will be played here

   In the mock match Wednesday, Mayor David Dinkins took his time

   ``I never make decisions quickly,'' Dinkins said, in a joking
reference to criticisms that he has been slow to fill key posts.
   Bob Burkett, senior vice president for Interscope, an organizer
of the event, said at the City Hall news conference the games will
open with a ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
   The early matches will be played at the new Mackelow Center in

<TEXT>
   An accountant accused of killing his
mother, wife and three children 18 years ago says he is innocent
because of a mental defect, the judge in the man's trial said.
   Jury selection was completed Wednesday evening after John E.
List's attorney, Elijah L. Miller, exhausted the 20 challenges he
can use to remove potential jurors.
   Superior Court Judge L'E. Wertheimer refused to grant him
additional challenges.
   ``Mr. List denies he is guilty of murder,'' Wertheimer told a
panel of potential jurors. ``He says, as a result of a mental
disease or defect, he committed (the crime).''
   Miller hinted at such a defense Tuesday when he asked a
prospective juror if he could still follow the judge's instructions
to be impartial if, ``for instance,'' List acted out of ``insanity
or a mental defect.''
   When asked what List's defense would be, Miller replied: ``What
the judge said.''
   Miller is expected to appeal Wertheimer's rejection of his juror
challenges and the selection of some jurors, claiming that they are
biased.
   None of the 16 jurors live in Westfield, where the slayings took
place. Some have said they read or heard about the murders. All
told Wertheimer they had no opinion regarding List's innocence or
guilt.
   More than 130 Union County residents were interviewed since jury
selection began Tuesday. The trial is scheduled to begin March 30,
after a week of pre-trial hearings.
   List, 64, is accused of killing his mother, wife and three
children in their Westfield mansion in November 1971.
   Authorities said the former accountant spent most the last 18
years in Denver, where he remarried. He was arrested by the FBI on
June 1, shortly after moving to a suburb of Richmond, Va. His case
also was featured on a nationally televised anti-crime program.

<HEAD>Kathleen Turner Stars in a Revival of `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 3rd graf, ``Big Daddy ...'' to CORRECT spelling of
lascivious. No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yes, Kathleen Turner is a tough, sexy and even
funny Maggie in the respectable, occasionally riveting, revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' that opened Wednesday at Broadway's
Eugene O'Neill Theater.
   But the heart of Tennessee Williams' Southern-fried Gothic
melodrama belongs to Big Daddy, the dying patriarch of ``28,000
acres of the richest land this side of the valley Nile.''
   Big Daddy is an amazing role, maybe the best Williams ever
wrote. The character contains all the colorful peculiarities that
people, mostly Yankees, love to associate with the South. Yet he's
more than a brutal, money-grubbing, lascivious mountain of a man.
   Played with remarkable control by Charles Durning, Big Daddy is
a seeker of truth, and truth is what ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' is
all about. Everybody else in the play, including Maggie, is afraid
of it.
   The truth has kept Maggie and her alcoholic husband, Brick,
apart. Brick, Big Daddy's favorite son, is an aging golden boy
whose luster has begun to tarnish. He drinks his days away, hoping
to hear ``the click'' that will help him forget a promising
football career and the relationship he had with Skipper, his
now-dead best friend.
   The truth is what everyone is trying to hide from Big Daddy who
has been told his stomach troubles are nothing more than a spastic
colon. But reality is revealed in a long second act confrontation
between Brick and Big Daddy. The father forces his son to look into
the past and the son inadvertently tells the father about the
future.
   It's a powerful moment, particularly as played by Durning and
Daniel Hugh Kelly as the doomed Brick. Brick is something of a
cipher, a difficult character to get a handle on, but Kelly manages
to make him a sympathetic person. That's no mean feat. And Durning
is at his best, alternatively flamboyant and ultimately sensitive
to his son's problem. It's a remarkable juggling act.
   Turner controls the play's first and third acts. The woman is a
star, and it's not easy to take your eyes off her as she sashays
around the stage, particularly in designer Patricia Zipprodt's
lavender lace slip.
   There's an intelligence and a steely determination to her
portrayal of Maggie, particularly when she is defending her own
interests. You can see the combative character plot her attack,
trying to stop brother-in-law Gooper and his wife, Mae, from
getting control of Big Daddy's will.
   Director Howard Davies' approach to the play is traditional,
nothing as startling or eccentric as Sir Peter Hall's distinctive
examination of Williams' ``Orpheus Descending'' early in the
season. There are no surprises or revelations but then nothing goes
wrong either.
   Polly Holliday as Big Mama starts in high screech but gradually
calms down so that by the time the play ends she has become a woman
of strength. Kevin O'Rourke and Debra Jo Rupp teeter on caricature
as Maggie's greedy family opponents but pull back before turning
into cartoons. And their gaggle of children, those celebrated
``no-neck monsters,'' are appropriately _ and hilariously _
repulsive.
   ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' was Williams' personal favorite among
his own works. He loved the play's unity. Its action over the three
long acts is continuous. He loved its impeccable construction. And
he loved those characters, particularly Big Daddy.
   ``I reached beyond myself, in the second act, to a kind of crude
eloquence of expression in Big Daddy that I have managed to give no
other character of my creation,'' Williams says in his ``Memoirs.''
Watching Durning on stage, you can perfectly understand that
statement.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: It takes nothing away from
Kathleen Turner's radiant Maggie in ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' to
say that Broadway's gripping new production of Tennessee Williams'
1955 play will be most remembered for Charles Durning's Big Daddy.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: We find ourselves seeing the play
clearly but dispassionately. Detachment is not what Williams had in
mind.
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: Turner, mocking yet fearful,
sassily funny yet itchy with desires that go beyond sex, and the
all but innocent victim of a family in perpetual and hateful
crisis, is giving a performance to cherish, in a play to revalue.

   A woman apparently despondent over marital
and financial troubles shot her three sleeping children to death,
then killed herself after scrawling ``God please forgive me'' in
crayon on a wall, police said.
   The bodies were found Wednesday by a friend of two of the
children, who said she entered their house by squeezing through a
pet door when she saw through a window that messages had been
written on the dining room wall.
   ``The family had been having some financial and personal
problems of late, and that appears to be the motive,'' Detective
Rick Swanston said.
   The detective identified the victims as Roxanne Fernandez Jones,
32, and her children, Brandy Fernandez, 16, Leticia Fernandez, 13,
and Jeremiah Jones, 7. Also dead was the family dog, Wolf.
   Detectives found a .22-caliber rifle and a lengthy suicide note
from Mrs. Jones, Lt. William Gaida said.
   ``She wrote a several-page suicide note asking for her loved
ones to forgive her,'' he said. ``The note basically had stuff
like, `God forgive me' and things of that nature.''
   Crystal Erickson, 15, a friend of the sisters, found the bodies
in the Reseda home about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   She said when she got inside the house she found the words ``God
please forgive me'' and ``My loved ones please forgive me'' written
on a wall.
   On the table was a suicide note that read in part: ``If we're
not dead don't call the paramedics,'' she said. It also said Mrs.
Jones loved her children and hated to put them through living in a
world full of strife, the girl said.
   The sisters' bodies were found in their bedrooms. The bodies of
the mother and boy were in the master bedroom, Gaida said. Each
child had been shot in the chest and in the head, he said.
   Neighbors said Mrs. Jones had separated four months ago from her
second husband and had been unable to find steady work.
   The mother baby-sat and worked several odd jobs, including
distributing flyers for a pizzeria where one her daughters worked
until getting laid off a week ago, said Derek Shelton, Brandy
Fernandez's boyfriend.
   ``I can't believe she did this,'' said Joyce Pacheco, who lives
around the corner. ``Roxanne never seemed depressed about
anything.''

   The FBI issued composite drawings of the two
thieves who pulled off one of the biggest art thefts of the
century, and the number of tips coming from the public has stepped
up, an official said today.
   Clad in police uniforms, the pair talked their way into the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum early Sunday, then overpowered the
two guards on duty and took 11 paintings, drawings and prints by
such artists as Rembrandt and Degas. They also swiped an ancient
Chinese vase and a gilded eagle from the flagpole of a Napoleonic
flag.
   Lyle Grindle, director of museum security, said this morning
that since the composites went out Wednesday afternoon, the pace of
calls from tipsters seemed to have increased. A $1 million reward
has been offered for information for the return of the pictures.
   ``We're getting information,'' he said. ``We're getting lots of
calls, from all aspects.''
   Even before the $1 million reward was posted and the pictures
were issued, tipsters began calling the Gardner Museum and the FBI,
hinting they knew where the artworks could be found, officials said
Wednesday.
   At the same time, with two of the museum's looted rooms now
behind police barricades, the public was allowed inside Wednesday
for the first time since the crime.
   Considered too well-known to be sold on the open market, the
five paintings and other works from Mrs. Gardner's collection has
been estimated to be worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The international auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's are
underwriting the $1 million reward, offered with no questions
asked, for safe return of the works.
   ``You're generally talking about thieves that are going to be in
contact with others in criminal circles and that's where it
(tipsters' information) generally comes from,'' said FBI agent
Dennis O'Callaghan.
   While he would not comment on whether staff at the museum had
been given lie detector tests, he said former employees were being
questioned, a standard practice in such cases.
   The thieves took two paintings and an etching by Rembrandt,
three prints and two charcoals by Edgar Degas; one painting each by
Edouard Manet, Jan Vermeer and Govaert Flinck, and a bronze beaker
dating from the Chinese Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100 B.C.
   The museum discovered Tuesday that a gilded eagle atop a
Napoleonic flag was also stolen.
   The composites showed two white men in policemen's hats. One was
depicted with gold wire-rimmed glasses, a strong jaw, dark hair and
eyes and was described as being in his late 20s to early 30s, of
medium build and 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10. The other suspect, shown
with pronounced cheekbones and dark hair and eyes, was thought to
be in his early to middle 30s, 180 pounds and 6-feet or 6-foot-1.
   The composites showed the suspects both with mustaches and
without because authorities believe they might have worn fake
mustaches during the robbery.

   Jurors at John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial
watched the last of President Reagan's videotaped testimony today
as the former president displayed annoyance at a prosecutor's
question.
   The jurors watched closely, but didn't react when Reagan became
visibly irritated at prosecutor Dan Webb, who said Reagan wasn't
answering a question.
   Webb asked Reagan whether the presidentially appointed Tower
Commission concluded Oliver North was assisting the Contras
militarily. Webb objected when Reagan launched into a description
of the commission and brought up diverting Iran arms sale money to
the Contras.
   ``That answer ... is completely unresponsive. Completely,'' Webb
told the judge.
   ``I don't think it is unresponsive to state what I appointed the
commission to do,'' Reagan retorted. The playing of the videotape,
which began Wednesday morning, was to conclude at midday today.
   Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser, is
charged with five felony charges of conspiracy, making false
statements and obstructing Congress in connection with the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Meanwhile, Poindexter's lawyers say the jury should be told that
North was called a liar by prosecutors at his own trial.
   When he testified at his own trial last year, North implicated a
number of other Reagan administration figures, including Poindexter.
   ``Few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many others
for so many lawless acts,'' prosecutors told the judge in the North
case last year. They said he committed ``perjury on the witness
stand.''
   At the Poindexter trial, however, North is the government's star
witness, although a reluctant one, and prosecutors are placing
great reliance on his testimony.
   ``Fundamental fairness requires'' that the jury be told what
prosecutors ``previously has had to say about Lt. Col. North's
credibility,'' Poindexter's lawyers said in court papers.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene has not indicated when
he will rule on Poindexter's request to introduce the prosecutors'
contention that North committed perjury.
   Poindexter's trial continues today with the jury scheduled to
finish watching eight hours of videotaped testimony by former
President Reagan.
   When North testified in Poindexter's trial, he said he could not
recall details he provided at his own trial. Prosecutors responded
by repeatedly referring the witness back to his damaging statements
last year about Poindexter.
   ``It would be totally unfair to allow the prosecutor to argue
that Lt. Col. North's testimony at his own trial was more
believable than his testimony at this proceeding,'' the defense
said in its court papers.
   In 1989, North testified in detail about Poindexter sending him
to a meeting with congressmen, where North lied about his
Contra-related activities. North denied that he was assisting the
rebels militarily or raising money for them.
   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''
North testified.
   At Poindexter's trial, North's testimony on the meeting with
congressmen was more equivocal and the former White House aide
emphasized that nobody had told him to lie.
   Meanwhile, Poindexter lost a court fight Wednesday over Reagan's
diaries as the defense began showing Reagan's videotaped testimony
to the jury.
   Greene said Reagan does not have to produce diary entries sought
by his one-time national security adviser.
   Poindexter said he needed the excerpts because Reagan, in his
taped testimony, ``professed a total inability to recall'' the
diversion of Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras and
a 1985 Hawk missile shipment.
   Greene said the entries, which he has read, ``offer no new
insights about these events.''

   President Bush today declined to criticize
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's order that Lithuanians
surrender arms and said there are ``certain realities'' that govern
Moscow's control over the rebellious republic.
   ``I am convinced the answer is peaceful discussion between the
parties...I believe they can talk and work out these problems,''
Bush said.
   The president, at an impromptu news confernce on the South Lawn,
also prodded Congress to move more quickly on his proposal for $800
million in aid for Panama and Nicaragua.
   Bush, noting that his request appeared to be bogged down in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, appealed to lawmakers to give him
the authority to decide how to pay for the program if they can't.
   He has said that he wants the money to come from Pentagon
programs.
   Bush took questions from reporters after participating in a
tree-planting ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III today told South African officials they must end a nearly
4-year-old state of emergency before Washington lifts sanctions
against the white-led government.
   Baker met with an African National Congress delegation, which
criticized the first visit in 12 years by a U.S. secretary of state
on the ground that it gives the government's reform program
legitimacy that the black anti-apartheid group feels has not been
earned.
   Despite protest by the ANC, Baker then met with President F.W.
de Klerk, who said he did not consider Baker's visit a reward for
recent reforms but ``proof of the interest which America has in
this region.''
   De Klerk said he and Baker discussed civil wars in neighboring
Angola and Mozambique as well as developments inside South Africa,
but not sanctions.
   Baker said de Klerk told him Pretoria wants to end the national
state of emergency in effect since June 1986 and free political
prisoners.
   After an earlier luncheon meeting with Foreign Minister Pik
Botha, Baker said he discussed the emergency, noting that its
lifting was one of the conditions set by the U.S. Congress for
ending economic sanctions.
   Baker said the U.S. government hoped that the state of emergency
would be ended ``at an appropriate time, consistent, of course,
with the maintenance of law and order.
   ``We approve of the direction that the government has recently
been moving in,'' Baker said.
   The Pretoria government last month released black nationalist
leader Nelson Mandela after 27 years of imprisonment and legalized
the ANC and other groups.
   The state of emergency, however, allows police to detain people
indefinitely without trial, outlaw certain forms of protest and
subject the news media to various restrictions.
   Botha said the South African government wants to end the state
of emergency as soon as the level of political violence in the
country is brought down. ``We don't want it,'' he said of the
nearly 4-year-old state of emergency. ``It is bad for us, our name
abroad, our reputation.''
   Govan Mbeki, a member of the ANC's National Executive, said
after his delegation's 90-minute meeting with Baker today: ``We are
not happy with the fact that he has come here to consult with the
South African government.''
   Mbeki said the ANC wants a complete cut in diplomatic contacts
with the South African government.
   Mandela on Wednesday asked Baker not to meet with de Klerk. The
African National Congress deputy president said the meeting would
send an inaccurate message that South Africa has made meaningful
changes.
   The secretary met with Mandela in Namibia because Mandela
refused to meet with him in South Africa. But Mbeki and two of
Mandela's other co-defendants sentenced to life in prison with him
met with Baker in Cape Town.
   And Walter Sisulu, the internal leader of the ANC in South
Africa, planned to meet with Baker on Friday in Soweto, outside
Johannesburg.
   Baker said the meeting today with 11 members of the African
National Congress and its ally, the United Democratic Front,
produced more agreement than disagreement. ``The fact is, we share
the same goals,'' said Baker.
   Mbeki said, ``The United States is probably the most powerful
country in the world and would necessarily have a great impact on
happenings in South Africa, depending on how it uses that position
of power.''
   ``The American government and the American people should
continue to impose pressures on the South African government and
not relax at all until such time as the position will have to be
made clear that the South African government has no way of going
backwards,'' said Mbeki, who was freed in 1987 from a life prison
term for planning the ANC's guerrilla-sabotage campaign.
   Sisulu and the other co-defendants were freed in October, and
Mandela was freed in February after de Klerk legalized the ANC and
59 other organizations to encourage black leaders to negotiate with
the government on a new constitution and an end to apartheid.
Mandela will lead an ANC delegation in talks with de Klerk in Cape
Town on April 11.

   Bush was asked about Gorbachev's order the day before requiring
Lithuanian citizens to turn over their guns to Soviet authorities
in seven days.
   He passed up an opportunity to criticize the order, and said he
was certain neither side in the conflict wanted to see force used.
   Bush said he takes Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
at his word in his assurances earlier this week that the Kremlin
would not use force to block Lithuanian independence.
   ``We do not recognize the incorporation of Lithuania into the
Soviet Uniin. However, there are certain realities in life.
Lithuanians are well aware of them. And they should talk, as they
are, to the Soviet officials, about these differences,'' Bush said.
   The administration has steadfastly underscored its position that
the United States has never recognized the forced incorporation of
Lithuania and the other Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia.
   However, the United States has not extended formal diplomatic
recognition to Lithuania in the aftermath of its March 11
declaration of independence.
   The president, at a wide-ranging news conference that lasted
half an hour, also said he would like to see all Soviet troops
removed from Poland.
   Bush said he will not go to Nicaragua on April 25 for the
inauguration of Violeta Chamorro, but that he hoped to visit a
number of Latin American countries in the fall. The president also
said he hopes to be able to accept an invitation from Australian
Prime Minister Bob Hawke to visit Australia, although he did not
indicate when he would take the trip.

   Speaker Thomas Foley said today he expects the
House to approve legislation next week that would provide federal
assistance to families for child care, including care provided by
church-sponsored centers.
   Foley, D-Wash., said House debate had been set for Wednesday on
a child-care bill, which had been held up while Democratic leaders
worked in private to resolve differences within the party over
church-sponsored care.
   Although Democrats still have not produced a written version of
their bill, Foley said lbbying on its behalf.
   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., said the Christian Broadcasting Network
televised a number for its viewers to call members of Congress to
lobby against such a ban during a show hosted by former Republican
presidential candidate Pat Robertson.
   ``It's working,'' Walker said.
   That bill is more ambitious than what President Bush has
proposed, but the administration's endorsement did not come as a
surprise to Democrats. The White House had backed Stenholm in
similar debates last year.
   The Stenholm-Shaw version would cost an estimated $19.3 billion
over its five-year phase-in period. That is less than more
ambitious Democratic versions would cost, although Democratic
leaders have yet to produce their latest version in writing.
   Democratic leaders earlier agreed to combine competing proposals
to expand tax credits for low-income families for day care and
increase funding for day-care services under a block grant program.
   Other provisions would expand Head Start and increase a
school-based program of before- and after-school care.
   The Stenholm-Shaw version backed by the White House is similar
to one narrowly defeated by the House last fall.
   It would increase money for Head Start and the Social Security
block grants and expand the earned income tax credit for low-income
families.
   It would not include the school-based program, however, and
would eliminate the existing child-care tax credit for high-income
families. It would scrap requirements for government child-care
standards.
   The House last year gave tentative approval to competing
versions, one emphasizing block grants and the other establishing
new direct aid programs. House and Senate negotiators agreed later
on the new direct aid programs, but supporters of block grants
balked and Foley refused to allow a party-dividing fight over the
issue on the House floor.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today named
Terrence Burke to be acting head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration after Jack Lawn retires this week as the agency's
director.
   Burke, 51, currently the agency's acting deputy administrator,
previously served as deputy assistant administrator for operations
and head of the DEA's Phoenix office.
   Lawn, who has been DEA administrator since 1985, retires on
Friday to become vice president for operations of the New York
Yankees.
   A former Marine, Burke worked for the Central Intelligence
Agency from 1960 to 1970 and was awarded the CIA's intelligence
star of valor.
   Burke also served as assistant special agent in charge of the
DEA's Denver office. He was named acting deputy administrator last
October.
   The permanent job of DEA director is a presidential appointment
subject to confirmation by the Senate.

   Your chances of getting a telephoned tax
question answered correctly by the IRS are considerably better this
year _ but you will have more difficulty getting your call answered
at all, auditors said today.
   ``This year, IRS assistors have responded accurately to 78
percent of our tax-law questions, compared to 66 percent for the
same questions last year,'' Jennie S. Stathis of the General
Accounting Office told the House Ways and Means oversight
subcommittee.
   ``But taxpayers are having more difficulty reaching an IRS
assistor,'' she said. ``This year IRS is answering one out of three
calls; last year it answered almost two of three.''
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. blamed the problem on the
fact the Internal Revenue Service is under a hiring freeze and has
been forced to cut training and the number of toll-free telphone
lines. ``It bothers the hell out of me that taxpayer service has
declined that way,'' he said.
   Earlier today, Goldberg acknowledged the IRS is making mistakes
when it bills Americans for additional taxes and penalties but
denied the problem is as big as a magazine story indicates.
   Money magazine suggested there is a 50-50 chance the Internal
Revenue Service will make a mistake the next time it sends out a
bill for additonal taxes and penalties. The magazine said there is
evidence that $7 billion of the $15.3 billion collected as a result
of such letters last year was not really owed.
   ``That $15 billion, I think, is pretty much due and owing,''
Goldberg said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   But, he added, ``Sure, people pay money they may not owe. We
make mistakes.''
   The commissioner agreed with the magazine's advice _ that if the
IRS makes a mistake, the taxpayer should fight it. ``Grab us by the
neck and tell us,'' Goldberg said.
   In the cover story of its April edition, Money cited a report by
the General Accounting Office, interviews with tax lawyers and
accountants and a survey of its subscribers to conclude that half
the 36 million bills for taxes and penalties mailed out last year
contained errors.
   The form letters generated $15.3 billion last year, an average
of $425 per notice, Money noted.
   ``Yet, behind that apparent triumph of tax law micro-enforcement
lurks a sloppy little secret: a convincing case can be made that at
least $7 billion of that money should never have been collected at
all because around half of those imposing official notices were
inaccurate,'' the magazine said.
   ``Clearly, individuals are caving in to questionable demands for
more money that would propel them to the phone in a second if the
bill came from some bank or credit-card company.''
   Although IRS officials quarreled with Money's figures, the
agency acknowledges wholesale employee errors in answering
taxpayers' telephoned questions and in processing returns.
   In fact, IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. cited the
processing errors in testimony before a House subcommittee earlier
this month while pleading for money to modernize the agency's
1960s-vintage computer system.
   ``The net result will be fewer erroneous notices and levies
(property seizures) which cost both IRS and taxpayers time and
money to resolve, and will allow us to devote our resources to
truly delinquent accounts,'' Goldberg said.
   More than 35 percent of the IRS notices of additional taxes and
penalties allege mathematical errors, late returns, failure to pay
tax on some wages, interest or dividend reported by an employer or
bank; or underpayment of quarterly estimated taxes.
   Last month, Money polled 300 of its subscribers with a median
income over $52,000 a year and found that at sometime in their
lives, half had received IRS bills for more taxes and penalties.
Seven of 10 fought back.
   ``A stunning 45 percent of those who contested their notices
report that the IRS claims were totally incorrect and an additional
24 percent said that they were at least partially wrong,'' the
magazine wrote. ``What's more, of those who challenged the IRS on
their own, 53 percent wound up paying nothing and another 17
percent succeeded in getting the bill reduced.''
   The telephone poll had an error margin of plus or minus six
percentage points.
   Money blamed the IRS error rate on outmoded computers and poorly
trained, low-paid workers: the clerks who type data from tax
returns into computers at the agency's 10 regional service centers,
and the examiners who manage the notices and followup letters.
   The magazine said squalid working conditions in some IRS
facilities, including the big Andover, Mass., service center and
the Manhattan district office, cut deeply into employee morale and
increase the error rate.
   The story suggested three reasons why taxpayers coughed up the
money they did not owe:
   _``Simple undifferentiated fear of fighting. The IRS is infamous
for star-chamber audits, summary confiscation of property and
all-seeing, imperious independence.''
   _``The notices tend to be confusing, compounding the maddening
complexity of tax law itself.'' The magazine quoted IRS Ombudsman
Damon O. Holmes as saying the notices are intelligible only to the
people who wrote them.
   _``Tax professionals attest that all too many intimidated
taxpayers fear that if they don't pay, they will suffer far worse.
They begin to imagine that the IRS will come to audit them and
perhaps end up questioning all sorts of deductions in the process.''
   The magazine offered this advice for taxpayers unfairly dunned
by the IRS: never ignore an IRS notice, respond quickly in sharp
but simple terms, follow up forcefully and get outside help if
necessary.

   Attackers believed to be Maoist guerrillas
broke into the home of a congressional candidate Thursday morning
and shot him to death as his wife and children watched, police said.
   The victim, Jose Gerardo, was a candidate of the center-left
Aprista party of President Alan Garcia. He was 38.
   Police said the four gunmen escaped in a waiting car after the
attack in Huancayo, an important agricultural center 120 miles east
of Lima.
   Police said no group took responsibility for the assassination,
but the Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group is active in the
area.
   In their effort to undermine the government, the rebels have
threatened candidates and urged people not to vote in the April 8
elections for president, congress and regional assemblies.
   On Monday, Shining Path rebels killed two independent candidates
for congress in Huanuco, 165 miles northeast of Lima.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in 1980 and
operates through most of the highlands and in the northeastern
jungle of Peru.

   An American fighter pilot accidentally released a
dummy bomb near the construction site of a nuclear waste
reprocessing center, news reports and U.S. military officials said
Thursday.
   The accident caused no injuries or damage, said Capt. Phillip
Delaney, a spokesman at the U.S. Misawa Air Base in northern Japan.
   Delaney said the pilot ``inadvertantly released'' the 25-pound
dummy bomb over a field about 1.5 miles from the base bombing
range. Dummy bombs are for practice and do not explode.
   He said there were no technical problems with the F-16C jet
fighter, which was conducting routine runs with three other planes
assigned to Misawa's 14th Tactical Fighter Squadron.
   A report Thursday in the nationally circulated newspaper
Mainichi Shimbun said the field is about four miles south of the
Rokkasho nuclear waste reprocessing center, which is under
construction.
   Delaney could not confirm the distance from the range to the
reprocessing center construction site. He said the circumstances
surrounding the accident were being investigated.

   Communist rebels firing from two vans
killed a lieutenant colonel and four other people, including a
young boy, in a daring ambush Thursday during the morning rush
hour, the military said.
   A police sergeant was also killed in a separate ambush in the
capital. The military said rebels may have been responsible for
that killing as well.
   Lt. Col. Francisco Flores and three enlisted men were shot to
death while riding to work at about 7:30 a.m. Five gunmen in two
vans opened fire at them in suburban Pasig, said police Sgt.
Archangel Estacio.
   A boy inside a passing car was hit by stray bullets and died at
a hospital. The boy's father, three bystanders, and a sergeant in
the targeted vehicle were injured, hospital staffers said. The
boy's age was not known.
   The gunmen, armed with M-16s and .45-caliber pistols, fired more
shots at the fallen military officer and warned the crowd at the
busy road not to interfere, a witness said. They fled in a car
stolen from the slain boy's father.
   About the same time in Valenzuela, six miles north of Pasig,
five men shot to death Sgt. Dionisio Bongkito of the Capital
Regional Command's Special Operations Group, local police said.
   Bongkito, who was driving in his car, slowed down at an
intersection on his way to work when the gunmen appeared and fired
at him with .45-caliber pistols.
   The gunmen then took the sargeant's M-16 rifle and his pistol
and fled aboard a commandeered passenger jeep.
   Police Sgt. Ponciano Casile said the local police still do not
have any suspects in the attack, but the jeep driver quoted the
gunmen as saying they were from the Communist New People's Army.
   The New Peoples Army, the military wing of the Communist Party
of the Philippines, has been waging a 21-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.

   A fire burned down 763 houses and left
almost 4,000 people homeless in Burma's capital, Rangoon, according
to a report seen Thursday.
   It took three hours to control the blaze, said the report from
Burma.
   According to the report, the fire began Tuesday in a house and
quickly spread, destroying homes, a monastery, a shop, and other
buildings. There was no mention of casualties.

<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control today
halted imports by three of the nation's largest monkey dealers over
concerns about a spreading virus.
   Ebola virus, which was the deadliest known virus in the world
before AIDS, was spotted in the United States in November in three
monkeys at the Hazleton Research Products Inc. facility in Reston,
Va. In January, an Ebola-related virus turned up in a monkey in a
Pennsylvania laboratory.
   In notices to Hazleton, Worldwide Primates of Miami and Charles
River Primates Corp. of Port Washington, N.Y., CDC Director William
Roper said CDC inspectors had found inadequate isolation and
quarantine conditions at the three facilities this week.
   Effective today, ``your registration to import nonhuman primates
into the United States will be revoked,'' Roper told the three
importers.
   The three are among four importers who handle 90 percent of U.S.
monkey imports, according to CDC officials. The fourth facility was
inspected and found to be in compliance with CDC guidelines, and no
action has been taken there.
   Meanwhile, New York state officials announced that effective
Thursday, no monkeys will be allowed into New York through John F.
Kennedy International Airport unless accompanied by written
documentation that they have been quarantined for at least 60 days
and tested negative for filovirus _ the family of virus that
includes Ebola virus.
   JFK is the airport of entry for about 80 percent of the 20,000
monkeys imported into the United States each year, according to New
York health officials.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Elaborate on Advice for Running Against Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he's got some
opinions about running against women candidates, but he won't say
what they are.
   Bush called himself an ``expert in the field,'' referring to his
1984 vice presidential race against then Rep. Geraldine Ferraro.
   He was asked at a news conference if he had any advice for
Clayton Williams, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas
whose opponent will be decided in a runoff between Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards and Attorney Gen. Jim Mattox.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
a woman.
   As for presidential advice, Bush retorted:
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' because it could end up ``complicating
his life,'' he said.
   ``Remember 1984. I can't forget it.''
   Williams, he said, is, ``entitled to his opinion. Maybe he's
drawing on my experience.''
   Bush had a hard time competing with the wave of positive feeling
Ferraro's candidacy initially generated among women.
   When at last he felt he had made a strong showing against her in
a televised debate, Bush stated he had ``kicked a little ass'' with
his performance.

<HEAD>Downstream Florida, Georgia Towns Brace As Bulge Of Water Moves
Toward Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rivers in flood-torn southeastern Alabama continued to recede
today, but towns on the Florida Panhandle and in southern Georgia
prepared for the bulge of water from last weekend's storms working
its way downstream.
   President Bush on Wednesday cleared the way for federal aid in
Elba, the hardest-hit town in Alabama, where residents are finding
a muddy mess as they return to homes and businesses that for the
most part were uninsured for floods.
   The town was inundated Saturday when a levee along the Pea River
burst after the region was pummeled with up to 16 inches of rain.
Across the South, the flooding forced hundreds to be evacuated and
was blamed for at least 11 deaths.
   Bush declared Coffee County, which includes Elba, a disaster
area, making citizens eligible for loans and other aid.
   ``Now that the flood waters in Coffee County have receded, we
have a big job ahead of us,'' Gov. Guy Hunt said. The White House
took no immediate action on Hunt's request for disaster
declarations in 25 other Alabama counties.
   In Florida, flooding along several rivers across the Panhandle
caused about 2,500 residents to flee. The latest evacuations were
on the lower Choctawhatchee, not expected to crest until later
today.
   In Caryville, Fla., and surrounding Washington County, about 100
miles west of Tallahassee, 1,200 were forced to flee their homes
since the weekend.
   ``There's not one place dry in town that I've seen,'' said
Caryville resident, Hershel Carnley. ``There's not much you can
say. It's a mess. Everybody in town is hurting.''
   In Hawkinsville, Ga., Civil Defense Director Sam Clark said the
last family was evacuated by boat from one threatened area before
dawn Wednesday. National Weather Service forecasters predicted the
Ocmulgee River will crest at 7 feet above flood stage Friday in the
south-central Georgia town.
   ``I had talked like a madman trying to get them to leave, but
they wouldn't,'' Clark said. ``They called about 3:30 for us to
come get them.''
   Rescuers in southeastern Alabama today found two missing
servicemen along the rain-gorged Pea River, where the pair had
launched a canoe Wednesday to view flood damage. The search
continued to the northeast in Dale County for a third soldier
missing for four days.
   All three were based in Fort Rucker, Ala., the U.S. Army's main
flight training base.
   Officials said the missing soldier, Mary Helen Garrison, 21,
apparently drove around a barricade and tried to ford a flooded-out
section of highway U.S. 84. Her car was found Tuesday.
   Many of the 2,000 people who evacuated Elba were at their homes
and businesses Wednesday, raking mud from floors and sorting
through the remains of their shattered lives. Most found little to
salvage.
   ``There's three generations of antiques and family heirlooms in
there,'' Becky Hayes said Wednesday as she stood outside a
mud-covered warehouse her family owns near the town square. ``Now
it's all upside down like scrambled eggs.''
   National Guardsmen set up checkpoints to allow in only residents
and business owners. At night, they continued to enforce a 7 p.m.
curfew.
   Gene Malfer, a spokesman for the American Red Cross, said the
organization estimated that 239 homes in Elba were destroyed, 286
suffered major damage and about 70 had minor damage.

   A toxin similar to red tide could have caused
the mysterious deaths of as many as 680 endangered sea turtles off
Colombia, officials said.
   Only a few thousand adult Pacific green turtles are known to
exist, so the beaching represents the loss of a substantial part of
the population, said Jack Woody, national sea turtle coordinator
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque, N.M.
   Some have suggested that the turtles beached themselves as
whales sometimes do.
   Colombian fishermen attributed the deaths to a curse put on them
for over exploiting the sea's resources, said Roderic Mast,
director of species conservation at Conservation International in
Washington, D.C.
   The turtles eat plant material, and some could have contained
toxins, Mast said Wednesday.
   ``Maybe they were affected by a red tide, or something like
that,'' he said.
   Another explanation could be that the turtles were caught in
fishermen's nets and drowned, Mast said.
   ``The local fishermen, who are the people who of course know the
area best ... are claiming they've never seen anything like this
before,'' Mast said.
   ``The likely cause, in my opinion, is probably drowning in
trawlers' nets,'' with the carcasses thrown overboard.
   On the other hand, he said, ``these things don't add up, because
if they were poor fishermen, you would expect them to keep the
turtles. There is a lot of good meat and oil there.''
   If the turtles died of natural causes, the conditions that
killed them could threaten other endangered turtles in the Pacific,
Mast said. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that might be happening.
   ``There are reports of turtle die-offs for no apparent reason in
other parts of the Pacific, indicating that something may be going
on that needs further research,'' he said.
   Some of those reports are coming from The National Marine
Fisheries Service, which is taking a count of dolphins and
porpoises in the Pacific, said Woody.
   ``This year they have seen some number of dead turtles floating
at sea,'' he said. ``Losing these animals and not knowing why is a
worrisome problem.''
   Ninety-eight percent of the turtles that washed ashore in
Colombia were Pacific green turtles, Mast said.
   They are the second most endangered sea turtles in the world,
after the Kemp's ridleys, said Woody.
   ``They're in tough shape,'' he said.
   Anne Meylan, a specialist with the Florida natural resources
department in St. Petersburg, said the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Panama has received reports from fishermen of
dead turtles washing up on the Pacific coast of Panama and floating
at sea.
   The deaths occurred about early December, said Argelis Ruiz
Guevara, a biology student at the institute who has been monitoring
the reports. She said she could not determine how many had died.
   The Colombian turtle beaching occurred in February, according to
Mast, who has just released details of a preliminary investigation
of the beaching. He said he has been receiving regular reports from
Diego Amorocho, a biologist with the Nature Foundation in the
Colombian capital, Bogota.
   Amorocho, with the financial backing of Conservation
International and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, reported
taking a census of some of the dead turtles along 200 miles of
beaches in northwestern Colombia.
   Amorocho estimated that 360 to 680 turtles had washed ashore
over a period of one or two days.
   Conservation International and the Fish and Wildlife Service are
paying for studies to try to determine the cause of death, Mast
said.

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Today'' show, temporarily in Los Angeles
and bathed in sunshine, may be making some viewers wonder how it
got the sun to rise so early _ since it is 4 a.m. on the West Coast
when the show starts in the East.
   It did it through the magic of videotape. Each morning's show
actually was taped the previous day at 3:30 p.m. PST, spokeswoman
Mary Neagoy said Thursday. Only its news segments were live.
   ``Today,'' normally seen live in Eastern and Central times
zones, originated on tape Wednesday and Thursday from a sunny beach
location at Venice, Ca.
   It will appear Friday, again on tape, from a historic Spanish
section in downtown Los Angeles.
   In the two broadcasts so far, co-host Bryant Gumbel has advised
viewers the shows were taped a day earlier ``to take advantage of
the California sunshine,'' Neagoy said.
   He will repeat the tape-delay advisory on Friday's show, she
added.
   The shows planned for Monday and Tuesday _ each centers on the
Oscar Awards ceremonies that ABC will televise Monday night _ will
be broadcast live, although not in the pre-dawn darkness.
   The shows will originate from inside Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood, Neagoy said.
   Despite its taped sunshine this week, ``Today,'' once the leader
in morning show ratings, found a continuing cause for gloom when
last week's audience estimates for morning shows became available
Thursday.
   The show, which in January dropped to second place after the
replacement of co-host Jane Pauley by Deborah Norville, trailed
ABC's first-place ``Good Morning America'' for the 11th consecutive
week.
   ABC's broadcast averaged a 4.5 rating, ``Today'' was a full
ratings point behind, and ``CBS This Morning'' had a 2.5 average,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.

   A police pursuit lasted 90 minutes _ but
only covered four miles _ after a man took off in a construction
tractor and refused to stop.
   Police say Mark David Lyman, 24, was walking home early
Wednesday when he passed a tractor parked at a construction site.
Lyman climbed into the driver's seat and started home, said Officer
Jim Doty.
   Police cruisers responding to the theft came upon Lyman, who was
driving at less than 20 mph. Although they had their lights
flashing and sirens wailing, the cars were unable to pass the
tractor and were forced to follow at ``very low speeds,'' Doty said.
   At one point, a few police cars managed to pull in front and
form a roadblock but retreated when they realized Lyman would not
stop, Doty said.
   Lyman was arrested as he pulled up to his grandmother's home. He
was charged Wednesday with grand larceny and driving under the
influence.

   Libby Swindle's idea of a 40th birthday
celebration is to climb a mountain. Ten times. In one day.
   ``I thought of a half-marathon or a cruise, but I thought this
would be more fun,'' Swindle, of Hot Springs, said after completing
her eighth circuit of the 1{-mile trail up Pinnacle Mountain.
   The climb began at 5:45 a.m. Wednesday, part of her tradition of
climbing the west summit trail at Pinnacle Mountain State Park at
sunrise. Each time she returned to the base, more friends and
relatives had arrived, some from as far as San Antonio, to cheer
her on.
   At the foot of the trail, friends decorated a picnic table and
placed a dozen roses in a grill. Nearby, a white sheet was strung
between two trees with balloons and messages from well-wishers.
``It's all downhill from here,'' said one. ``You're nowhere near
your peak,'' said another.
   Ms. Swindle said she had fallen and injured her ankle Tuesday
night. ``I was feeling pretty bad about the fourth time,'' she said
after lap No. 9. ``It feels good now. I think that it's numb.''
   She completed the 10th climb 12 hours after she started.
   Ms. Swindle said she began training in January and set a goal to
climb Pinnacle 40 times by her birthday. Wednesday's climbs topped
that by three.

   If Grand Island can't be the biggest,
then it says it's going to be the best.
   After Grand Island's claim of being the ``World's Largest
Freshwater Island'' was shot down a few weeks ago by a Buffalo
newspaper columnist, town officials found a solution: They crossed
out the word ``largest'' on a recently erected roadway sign and
replaced it with ``best.''
   Take that, Ilha de Marajo.
   The controversy began when the columnist saw the sign, did some
research and found that the Brazilian island, in the mouth of the
Amazon River, is 500 times larger than Grand Island, and that the
Great Lakes alone have 10 larger freshwater islands.
   ``Let the island in the Amazon dispute this,'' Robert W. Weaver,
a Grand Island Chamber of Commerce director, said after the sign
was edited Wednesday.
   Weaver said he wasn't remorseful about the original mistake. ``I
would do it all over again. It created a lot of controversy and
interest, and I think it brought Grand Island to the minds of many
people who don't think about it.''
   The 27-square-mile island lies between the two branches of the
Niagara River a few miles northwest of Buffalo.

   Britain on Thursday named a 31-year veteran of the

resumption of diplomatic ties that were severed during the 1982
Falkland Islands war.
   Humphrey Maud, 55, has served Britain at various levels in
Spain, Cuba, France and Luxembourg. He has been ambassador to
Cyprus since 1988, the Foreign Office said.
   He will take up his Buenos Aires post in July.
   Maud, married with three children, is also an accomplished

   Diplomatic ties were severed after Argentina, which claims the
Falklands and calls them the Malvinas, overran the south Atlantic
archipelago. Britain sent a naval task force and recaptured the
islands after a 74-day war.

   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner
has accepted a Soviet invitation to visit Moscow in the coming

   Shevardnadze made an unprecedented visit to NATO headquarters in
December in a dramatic sign of the thaw in relations between East

   Since then, the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia and Poland

   A major oil spill such as the one that
devastated Alaska's Prince William Sound a year ago could strike
New York or Los Angeles harbor, two environmental groups said
Thursday.
   One group, the Center for Marine Conservation, also said spills
are almost inevitable in the ecologically rich Florida Keys.
   The center and the Natural Resources Defense Council, in
separate studies undertaken after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska,
called for tighter standards governing tankers, pilots and tug
escorts.
   The center suggested that the Coast Guard establish a network,
much like the air-traffic control system, to monitor traffic off
the Florida Keys and the central California coast and advise
mariners of danger spots.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of
toxic crude oil into the sea when it ran aground in Prince William
Sound a year ago Saturday, soaking 1,100 miles of scenic coastland.
Searchers found 34,400 dead birds and believe at least 1,000 sea
otters and countless other animals died.
   ``An Exxon Valdez-size spill could occur in New York Harbor,''
the Natural Resources Defense Council concluded, saying 18 billion
gallons of oil are brought into the harbor each year and large
spills have dumped more than 2.4 million gallons into harbor waters
in the last 13 years.
   The report drew the same conclusion about Los Angeles Harbor,
where it said supertankers regularly arrive carrying 33 million
gallons of oil. It said more than 1.3 million gallons of oil and
fuel have spilled into the Los Angeles Harbor area from major and
medium spills since 1976.
   In a case study of San Francisco Bay, the center said the Coast
Guard regards it as more difficult to navigate than Prince William
Sound and noted that it contains 90 percent of California's coastal
wetlands. The entrance to the bay is ringed with national parkland
and existing and proposed marine sanctuaries.
   The study said tanker traffic is heavy and rising and will
increase by at least 25 percent if federal plans to lease Northern
and Central California offshore areas for oil drilling are approved.
   The Center for Marine Conservation said there have been no major
oil spills in the Florida Keys for many years, except for a spill
off the Marquesas in 1975, from which oil was driven ashore on a
30-mile stretch of the keys.
   ``Yet the great number of tankers and other vessels transiting
the Florida Straits makes spills a near inevitability given
historical patterns of tanker casualties,'' the center said.
   The center urged that the Coast Guard control traffic within 15
miles of the Keys, where a series of vessel groundings late last
year extensively damaged coral reefs.
   ``We have the know-how to prevent accidents before they happen,
especially in our most sensitive waters,'' said Roger McManus,
president of the center.
   Among other principal recommendations in the two reports are:
   _Requiring oil tankers and barges to have double hulls and
double bottoms.
   _Requiring tug escorts for tankers in difficult waters and
biologically sensitive areas.
   _Establishing tanker-free zones in environmentally vulnerable
areas.
   _Requiring licensed pilots for all tankers and barges over a a
minimum size within harbors.

   President Bush said today there is just ``a
nuance of difference'' with Poland over its demands for a signed
treaty guaranteeing its border before the two Germanys unite.
   Bush, in a news conference shortly after a second round of talks
with Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said the Poles and
Germans ``are very, very close now'' to an understanding that the
current borders must remain intact.
   ``Let them sort it out. It's going very well,'' Bush told
reporters.
   He said again that Poland will have a voice at the two-plus-four
talks on questions affecting its borders, and stressed that those
talks are not ``going to determine the fate of all of Europe.''
   Mazowiecki left the White House saying ``there are no problems
between us'' on Poland's demand for an early treaty with the two
Germanys guaranteeing its borders.
   Bush said he had not gotten any assurances from Mazowiecki that
the new non-communist government in Warsaw will press for
withdrawal of Soviet troops from its territory.
   ``There isn't any need for Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, and
the sooner they get out of there the better,'' said Bush.
   Mazowiecki has said he wants the Soviet troops to stay until the
German question is resolved. The prime minister, speaking with
reporters as he left the White House, said, ``We've stated publicly
we're going to start talks about that that will eventually lead to
total withdrawal'' of the Soviet forces.
   On the so-called two-plus-four talks on German unification
involving the two Germanys and the four Allied victors from World
War II, Bush said, if the talks involve Polish issues, ``Poland
should be there. Poland should be involved.''
   ``We don't see this as the group that is going to determine the
fate of all of Europe. ... But if two-plus-four starts talking
about Polish borders, for example, clearly the Poles should be
involved,'' the president said.
   Mazowiecki said he was ``very pleased'' with his talks with Bush.
   ``There are no problems between us'' on Poland's demand for an
early, swift treaty with the two Germanys guaranteeing its borders,
the prime minister said.
   ``The only problem is to persuade both our German partners that
it needs to be done swiftly and finally,'' said Mazowiecki, who
wants a guarantee in writing that a united Germany will not seek to
reclaim territories ceded to Poland after World War II.
   Asked if he and Bush had solved disagreements over how large a
role Poland should have in the talks, Mazowiecki replied, ``It is
well known that we will participate in the conference and we will
take part in everything that will affect and concern ourselves.''
   Poland has been assured a seat at the table when the two
Germanys and the four Allied victors from World War II _ the United
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ discuss issues
affecting the Polish border.
   Mazowiecki said the Poles want a treaty with the Germanys
``initialed prior to the German unification and finally reaffirmed
after the unification.''
   ``We do not really see any major reason why that should not
happen, because we want that to happen to make sure that the whole
debate would not have to be started all over again afterwards. We
would like to avoid this,'' he said.
   ``We know that after all we're going to live as neighbors with a
unified Germany from now on and we would like to see it as a good
neighborly relationship,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki then left for Capitol Hill and talks with leaders of
both the House and Senate.
   At a state dinner Wednesday night, Mazowiecki pressed his
insistence on a new treaty guaranteeing Poland's border and urged a
new political structure to free Europe of military rivalry.
   Earlier Wednesday Bush sought to assure Mazowiecki of U.S.
support for Poland's demand that its current western border not be
breached when the two Germanys unite.
   Both in private talks and in a poignant toast at the state
dinner, Mazowiecki stressed the issue's importance to Poles now
emerging from ``a long night of totalitarian oppression'' under the
Nazis and then communist rule.
   At the state dinner, Mazowiecki invoked Alexis de Tocqueville's
words about ``the unstoppable march of democracy.''
   ``Nowadays, we're witnessing an enormous acceleration of that
march _ in Nicaragua, Chile, even Mongolia, but most of all in
Eastern and Central Europe,'' he said. ``Democracy is a system
which secures the freedom of the individual, the freedom without
which no normal life is possible.''
   He recalled how Poland was ``ravaged by the Nazi invasion'' in
1939.
   ``Our people suffered more than any other on earth. Poland lost
6 million of its citizens, half of them Polish Jews,'' he said.
   After World War II, he said, ``for the next 45 years we were
forced to live under an alien political system, a totalitarian one,
which was imposed on the whole Eastern and Central Europe. The
Poles never accepted their fate and were the first to challenge
it.''
   Mazowiecki said, ``a need is emerging for a new structure ... to
gradually free Europe of military rivalry and bring the two
separated parts closer together.''
   ``Reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do
not fear either for their present or their future. For this reason,
an important component of the building must be the recognition of
the Polish border along the Oder-Neisse Rivers in the form of a
treaty,'' said the prime minister.

<HEAD>Public Works Systems in Bad State of Disrepair, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America is postponing the day of reckoning
with its deteriorating road, bridge and water network, driving the
eventual repair pricetag even higher, Congress was told Thursday.
   While there's little argument it will cost billions of dollars
to fix the system, no consensus has been reached on how to raise
the money, said the Office of Technology Assessment.
   ``As a country, we must face the fact that there is no free
lunch,'' said Edith P. Page, the study's project director. ``The
bad news is, we found no silver bullet.''
   ``The choices are clear,'' the report said. ``All levels of
government will have to raise taxes and a variety of fees to pay
for public works improvements or they will have to eliminate or
reduce services.''
   The House and Senate public works committees commissioned the
study, and the congressional research office produced a 140-page
report painting a grim picture of transportation and water systems.
   ``We've had a series of reports on this subject, each of which
has been greeted with massive indifference,'' said Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., who joined OTA officials at a news conference.
   ``I am baffled by this. We're on the edge, at least, of
disinvesting in public works,'' he said.
   The report described a public works network fallen into
disrepair _ making it difficult for people to get to and from work,
discouraging new plant construction and generally stifling the easy
movement of products to the marketplace.
   A variety of circumstances has conspired to leave the system in
poor shape, the study said, including a declining political
consensus for public works expenditures at all levels of government.
   The problem has worsened over the last decade as federal grants
to states have waned, local officials have been reluctant to hike
taxes and Washington has imposed costly new environmental and
health regulations on industry, it said.
   Two weeks ago, President Bush announced a national
transportation policy that would shift more costs to state and
local governments, calling for more toll roads, local gas taxes and
user fees. The plan was criticized by some local government
officials who said their budgets already were stretched to the
limit.
   ``Breaking the logjam created by these issues is no simple
matter,'' Ms. Page said, adding:
   ``Although states have increased their investments in public
works as federal support has dwindled for a variety of reasons, no
state has filled the gap between its infrastructure needs and
reductions in federal support.''
   ``We don't understand that running down the capital
infrastructure adds to the costs of production,'' she said.
   Said Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho: ``We concentrate on efforts in
raising the costs of doing business in the United States instead of
lowering the costs of doing business by rebuilding the
infrastructure.''
   ``This disinvestment is going to cost us a lot of money as it
causes sagging productivity,'' he said.
   The study said the nation's roughly 83,000 local governments
``are in an unenviable position _ they take the direct political
heat generated by public works issues.''
   The OTA report made no effort to say how much it would cost to
repair and modernize aging and deteriorating public works
facilities. But it noted one recent economic projection that if
spending were increased by $50 billion in the first year _ 1
percent of the gross national product _ ``productivity would rise
by $26.5 billion.''

<HEAD>Singer Gloria Estefan Undergoes Surgery For Crash Injury</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with quote from hospital

<TEXT>
   Singer Gloria Estefan, whose back was broken
when her tour bus was hit by a truck, underwent apparently
successful surgery today to have her spine stabilized with metal
rods, hospital officials said.
   The star of the Latin-pop group Miami Sound Machine was on the
operating table from 8:30 a.m. until shortly after noon. Dr.
Michael Neuwirth, her orthopedic surgeon, inserted the two rods
into her fractured vertebrae.
   ``So far things are going extremely well. It's been
successful,'' said Dr. Victor Frankel, president of the Orthopedic
Institute Hospital for Joint Diseases. He was not involved in the
surgery.
   Miss Estefan will need three to six months to recover from
injuries she suffered in the crash Tuesday in Pennsylvania, medical
experts said. State police said today the truck that hit the
group's bus had faulty brakes.
   The singer's ``prognosis is excellent for a return to normal
function,'' Neuwirth had said Wednesday.
   Known for her energetic dancing on stage, Miss Estefan felt
numbness and weakness in her legs after the accident. Besides being
fractured, the two vertebrae were slightly dislocated, doctors said.
   ``Ms. Estefan has a serious spinal injury. It is a fractured
subluxation of the spine. It requires an operation to stabilize her
spine,'' Neuwirth said.
   Miss Estefan, 32, initially was taken to the Community Medical
Center in Scranton, Pa., but she was flown by helicopter Wednesday
to New York for the operation.
   Dr. Harry Schmaltz of the Scranton medical center said the
singer will have to wear a device to restrict her movement during
recovery. ``She's not going to do much in the way of entertaining
for three to six months,'' he said.
   ``She's in a lot of pain, but her spirits are up,'' said her
sister, Becky Fajardo.
   Miss Estefan asked for a copy of the New York Post ``so she
could see her face on the cover,'' said hospital spokeswoman Mary
Costello, who classified the singer's condition as good.
   At the time of the accident, the Cuban-born singer and her group
were headed to Syracuse, N.Y., for a concert. The accident occurred
Tuesday on Interstate 380 near Tobyhanna in the Pocono Mountains in
eastern Pennsylvania.
   The tour bus was stopped for a jackknifed tractor-trailer when a
second tractor-trailer hit, throwing Miss Estefan from a couch
where she was sleeping. Her husband and 9-year-old son also were
injured, but less seriously.
   Pennsylvania State Police said this morning that an inspection
of the truck that hit the band's bus turned up faulty brakes.
Trucker Heraldo E. Samuels, already cited on charges of driving at
an unsafe speed, will face additional charges related to the brake
problem, police said.
   Fans flooded the switchboard of Community Medical Center and
sent her flowers and notes. Elton John sent flowers; well-wishers
who called included Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, John
Denver, Ryan O'Neal and Frankie Avalon, associates said.
   President Bush, who met the singer Monday to discuss her
anti-drug work, talked to her twice since she was hospitalized.
   Miss Estefan was nominated in February for a Grammy for her
vocal performance on the single ``Don't Wanna Lose You.''
   Her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection of dance songs
and ballads, was 26th on the Cashbox magazine pop chart last week.
   Miss Estefan and Miami Sound Machine have attracted listeners
worldwide with salsa, samba and conga for more than a decade. Their
hits include ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You'' and ``Anything for You.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev demanded
today that Lithuania stop a sign-up of volunteer forces to protect
the Baltic republic's declaration of independence.
   In another move to increase pressure on officials who led the
republic to declare independence on March 11, Gorbachev told
Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis to report back on the
matter in two days.
   In a telegram, the text of which was read on the evening TV news
program ``Vremya,'' Gorbachev that volunteers must not be signed up
in Lithuania to take the place of Soviet border guards and police.
   He called on Landsbergis ``to take urgent measures to stop all
activity aimed at creating these kinds of organizations,'' and
called for a response in two days.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev ordered Lithuanian citizens to turn in
all their firearms, and ordered a strengthened border regime around
the republic.

   The daily number of East Germans
resettling in West Germany has dropped in half in the past week,
apparently as a result of the national elections held in their
homeland, the Interior Ministry said Thursday.
   The ministry said 931 East German resettlers registered with
federal authorities on Wednesday, compared with 2,248 one week ago.
It was the lowest figure in several months, the ministry said.
   On Tuesday, 1,156 East Germans applied for permanent residence
in West Germany, and on Monday the number was 1,539, said the
Interior Ministry.
   In recent weeks, the daily number of new arrivals often
surpassed 2,000.
   About 150,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany since
the beginning of the year, joining more than 340,000 who made the
trip last year.
   The exodus sparked the revolution for democratic reform that led
to elections Sunday in East Germany. At the same time, it has bled
East Germany's struggling economy and placed severe burdens on West
Germany's social services net and housing and job markets.
   But the constant stream appears to be ebbing as a result of
Sunday's vote, in which an alliance favoring quick reunification
with West Germany won the most votes.
   The decrease may also be a result of West Germany's decision
Tuesday to end a 40-year-old program that provided shelter,
low-interest loans and ``starting-out money'' for East German
resettlers.
   On Thursday, the government took yet another step to discourage
East Germans from heading permanently West.
   Starting next week, East Germans who quit their jobs at home to
move West will have to wait three months before they can qualify
for West German unemployment benefits.
   Previously there was no waiting period for the unemployment
money.

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A column of Soviet armored personnel
carriers and army trucks drove through the center of the Lithuanian
capital today in the Kremlin's latest show of force in the
breakaway republic.
   Lithuanian officials protested increased Soviet military
activity and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decree Wednesday
ordering citizens to turn in their guns, saying the republic's
independence movement has been non-violent.
   Gorbachev today also demanded that Lithuania stop signing up
volunteer defense forces. The request came in a telegram to
Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis and was read on the
evening TV news program ``Vremya.''
   A convoy of 15 personnel carriers and five trucks, towing
military equipment, rolled through Vilnius this afternoon.
   The action came just hours after Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene complained of the increasing activity of
Soviet soldiers and demanded an explanation from the Kremlin.
   During a break in today's Supreme Council session, she told
reporters an estimated 30,000 Soviet troops were stationed in the
republic, whose Parliament declared independence from Moscow on
March 11 after the ruling Communists were removed from power in
free elections.
   ``But, it changes daily,'' she said, explaining why she sent a
telegram to Gorbachev on Wednesday night demanding to know the
number of Soviet troops and amount of military equipment sent to
Lithuania over the past few days.
   Gorbachev has called Lithuania's declaration of independence
illegal but has also said he would not use force to keep it from
seceding from the Soviet Union, which annexed the republic after
assuming control under terms of the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1940.
   Ms. Prunskiene called Gorbachev's decree to turn in weapons
within a week ``an expression of mistrust in the whole population''
of the Baltic state.
   Lithuanian Interior Minister Marionis Myasyukonis told The
Associated Press, ``There are about 30,000 officially registered
shotguns, mostly in the possession of hunters and collectors.''
   ``There has not been one case of aggression, so why confiscate
shotguns?'' said Lithuanian legislator Algimontas Cekuolis. ``The
laws of Moscow are not valid in the sovereign state of Lithuania.
No guns will be returned.''
   Landsbergis said Gorbachev's decree shows ``the ghost of
Stalinism is walking in the Kremlin'' and that it could be enforced
``only by brutal military force.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
reiterated today that Moscow had no plans to use force but declined
to say whether the Kremlin might order the arrest of Lithuanian
leaders.
   ``We want to solve this problem as peacefully as possible and
according to the laws of the country,'' he told reporters during a
news briefing.
   The Soviet general who commands Lithuania's volunteer civil
defense agency said he has partially complied with orders to turn
over to the Soviet military the weapons and 16,000 vehicles under
his command.
   Gen. Ginutis Taurinskas told the Lithuanian Parliament he was
ordered ``to give all small caliber weapons to military units so
there won't be any eventual theft of arms for inappropriate use.''
   He said firearms remained scattered among 500 to 600 units of
volunteers who carry out air raid drills and train young people for
military service. He gave no figures.
   Gorbachev, using the powers he gained when the Congress of
People's Deputies elected him the Soviet Union's first executive
president last week, said Lithuanians had a week to turn in their
firearms.
   If they fail to do so, he said the Soviet Interior Ministry
should be prepared to confiscate them.
   Gorbachev also told KGB border troops to tighten their watch
over the republic and told officials to reduce the number of visas
issued to foreigners seeking to visit the republic.
   His decree was the latest in a series of increasingly tough
moves taken by Moscow in an attempt to discourage secession by the
republic of 3.8 million people.
   It came less than 24 hours after a strong protest from
Lithuania's government over stepped up maneuvers by the Soviet
military in the state.
   Lithuania's was independent from 1918 until 1940, when it was
forcibly annexed along with Latvia and Estonia. So far, no foreign
country has officially recognized Lithuania as independent.
   Lithuania had rushed to declare its independence before
Gorbachev could gain broad powers that include authority to impose
direct presidential rule on areas of the Soviet Union.
   Asked late Wednesday whether Gorbachev was conducting
psychological warfare on the small republic, Cekuolis said, ``Yes,
this is a war of nerves, but we are not nervous. We have the
motivation, we have our country, and we know where we are going.''
   Most firearms are tightly controlled in the Soviet Union, so
Gorbachev's directive primarily touched hunting weapons. Relatively
few people own firearms, and they must be registered with
authorities.
   Also Wednesday, Moscow lawmakers gave initial approval to a
draft law that would make secession from the Soviet Union illegal
without a republic-wide referendum and a five-year transition
period.
   One of two chambers in the Supreme Soviet standing legislature
gave the bill preliminary approval and sent it to the other chamber.
   Deputies said its prompt passage was needed to dissuade other
republics from copying Lithuania, as fellow Baltic republics Latvia
and Estonia are expected to do.
   A group of conservative deputies to the Congress appealed to
Gorbachev to impose direct rule on Lithuania, charging that the
republic was about to pass legislation making it illegal to speak
out against the independence movement.
   Senior Lithuanian legislators confirmed such legislation
existed, but said it was unlikely to be approved by Lithuania's
Parliament.

<DATELINE>COPSA MICA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every building, street, leaf or scrap
of earth in this town of 10,000 is black, shrouded in the soot of
some of Eastern Europe's worst pollution.
   Each year, Copsa Mica's two factories spew out about 30,000 tons
of pollutants. Some of it is soot from a factory that puts dye in
rubber. Some is dust from a plant for nonferrous metals.
   Everybody has known for years it was bad to live here, but under
the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, nobody dared say so.
   Residents say the pollution problem was acknowledged only when
Ceausescu's son, Nicu, visited the town for two days last fall and
the factories were shut down.
   The situation in Copsa Mica is in some ways typical of
industrial areas in other Eastern European countries, where
Communist governments eager for industrial development ignored
environmental damage.
   Now, millions of people in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania are using their new freedoms to
expose one of the legacies of Stalinism: destruction of the
environment in economies run by decree rather than logic.
   As Eastern Europe rediscovers its political voice, ecological
movements and Greens parties are becoming important.
   In Czechoslovakia, for instance, where an estimated 35 percent
of all forests are damaged by pollution, sulfur dioxide emissions
are double those in neighboring West Germany. The Greens party
ranks second in the polls behind Civic Forum and Public Against
Violence, movements that led the peaceful revolution against
Communist rule.
   In Romania, too, an emerging National Ecology Movement claims at
least 40,000 active supporters. Even before May's scheduled
elections, the provisional government has set commissions to battle
the blight imposed by Ceausescu's rule.
   ``Ceausescu ordered the building of big factories, but when it
was a question of buying anti-pollution devices, he never accepted
that,'' said architect Serban Popescu-Criveanu, chairman of one of
the new national bodies.
   ``He said `Let's start, and we'll do that later.' And that later
meant never.''
   Similarly haphazard planning and the resulting pollution helped
bring about last fall's revolt in East Germany, home of some of
central Europe's dirtiest industrial towns.
   In Bulgaria in 1988, it was environmental dissent and a
government crackdown on it that sowed the seeds of today's broader
opposition to the Communists.
   In Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union, environmental awareness
helped start political reforms that in turn have heightened public
consciousness of pollution. It is a touchstone issue in
traditionally rural countries whose folklore values the peasant
customs, forests, lakes and clean air that vanished under communism.
   Despite the East's growing environmental awareness, the cost of
cleaning up the mess, lack of international cooperation and a
threat of unemployment mean that any improvement will take decades.
   Hungary, for instance, decided in 1982 to become the first East
bloc country to control toxic waste that previously was buried in
unregulated dumps, which environment official Robert Reiniger calls
``ticking timebombs.''
   The one waste burner put into operation since 1982 cost $36.7
million, including more than $2 million in hard currency in a
country that needs every cent to repay its $20 billion foreign debt.
   On the international scale, costs are far higher. A recent study
by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis near
Vienna estimated that $18 billion a year would be needed to cut by
50 percent the sulfurous emissions eating at Europe's forests.
   Even that huge investment won't arrest the acidification of
Europe's soils unless the money is used chiefly to curb the air
pollution from its chief sources in Eastern Europe, the institute's
experts say.
   Yet cross-border cooperation is hard to achieve. Czechoslovakia
and Hungary, for instance, still cannot decide the fate of a giant,
half-completed plan to dam and re-channel the Danube river for
hydroelectric plants. But both countries now agree potential energy
gains should be weighed against possibly lasting damage to land and
wildlife.
   While governments seem to fear losing the huge sums already
spent on projects such as the Danube dam, workers worry about
losing their livelihood if industries are closed.
   When Romania's new government closed a well-known national
eyesore, a synthetic materials plant in the northern town of
Suceava, hundreds of its workers traveled to Bucharest to protest.
   Communism's failure to keep its promises of a better life for
its people mean that many of Eastern Europe's new voters, like the
East Germans last weekend, favor parties who offer economic growth.
   While new wealth may help curb some existing pollution, it could
create new environmental damage by increasing demands for energy in
countries with few natural fuel resources and growing appetites for
consumer goods.
   In Budapest, for instance, the growth in private car ownership
means clogged city streets. But it also means the incidence of
asthma has doubled in the last 10 years in one busy district where
lead content in the air is 18 times what it should be.

<HEAD>Hawke Seeks Record Fourth Term in Weekend Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke seeks a record
fourth consecutive victory for his governing Labor Party in the
election Saturday, which he says will set Australia's course into
the 21st century.
   When he set the date Feb. 16, Hawke said it was the most
important election in more than 40 years.
   Hawke, in office seven years, is the most enduring and popular
Labor Party leader. Polls forecast a close vote between Labor and
the opposition Liberal-National Party coalition, but no contest
when it comes to the prime minister's personal popularity.
   Bulletin magazine said a survey conducted last weekend indicated
43 percent of the voters supported Labor and the opposition
alliance, led by Andrew Peacock of the Liberal Party, had edged up
a point to 39 percent.
   It said 14 percent supported the centrist, environmentalist
Australian Democrats, the greatest following the party has achieved.
   Australia has 10.6 million eligible voters among its 16.5
million people, and voting is compulsory.
   The magazine said 2,492 people across Australia were questioned.
It did not give the margin of error.
   Foreign policy is unlikely to change regardless of who wins the
election. Labor and the opposition alliance have similar positions
and support continued close relations with the United States.
   Little controversy arose during the campaign and newspapers
described it as the dullest of recent times.
   The liberal Sydney Morning Herald said Hawke and Peacock ``have
the combined charisma of a wet salad sandwich.'' The tabloid Daily
Telegraph of Sydney asked: ``Excuse us, but has anyone seen the
election campaign?''
   Labor ran on its record of economic management, despite a
foreign debt equivalent to $100 billion and record 18 percent
interest rates that hurt home buyers and small businesses.
   A Daily Telegraph editorial said: ``The federal election
campaign is drifting on an ocean of apathy because so many
Australian families are drowning in a sea of debt and feel they are
living in a sinking country.''
   ``I believe the election is the most important one since 1949,''
the 60-year-old prime minister said when the campaign began,
referring to a Labor loss that began 23 years in power for the
Liberals.
   ``The election will essentially determine the character of the
nation that we are going to have in the 21st century,'' Hawke said.
   Peacock, 51, predicts a 16-seat victory in the 148-seat House of
Representatives. He has asked Australians to dump Labor for a
government that will help the ``battlers,'' as Australians call
poorer working people.
   In the current house, Labor has 85 seats, the Liberal Party has
45 seats, and its coalition partner, the National Party, has 18
seats.
   A former foreign minister, Peacock is making his second attempt
to become prime minister. A poll conducted by the newspaper
Melbourne Age indicated he trailed Hawke in personal popularity,
with 23 percent to Hawke's 52 percent.
   Hawke became prime minister in 1983. He won elections the
following year and in 1987 and hopes to carry a fifth for Labor
before retiring. The term in Australia is three years.

<HEAD>German Businessman Charged With Helping Build Libyan Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West German businessman on Thursday
was indicted on charges he helped build a Libyan plant, which the
United States says produced chemical weapons before it was damaged
by fire last week.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, former head of the Imhausen-Chemie
chemical company, was charged with violating West Germany's export
laws and with tax evasion.
   Also Thursday, a government official said Libya had stopped
payments to West German firms and interrupted trade, claiming West
German intelligence was involved in the fire. West Germany denied
the accusation and issued a formal protest over the suspension of
payments.
   Mannheim prosecutor Peter Wechsung charged that
Hippenstiel-Inhausen had a ``decisive role'' in the planning and
construction of the Rabta complex, about 60 miles outside Tripoli.
   Court officials said the trial may begin in the summer.
   Wechsung said the businessman sent Libya ``documents on
production'' as well as ``measuring and regulating instruments'' to
be used at Rabta. He said investigators had concluded that the
plant was ``solely intended'' to produce poison gases.
   Libya has said the plant was only making pharmaceuticals.
   Wechsung also said that West Germany's federal police had
created a special ``Rabta'' unit consisting of 20 officials who
took part in the investigation.
   Speaking to reporters in Mannheim, Wechsung said about 3,000
files containing documents, plans and other material had been
confiscated in the investigation and that statements were taken
from more than 200 witnesses.
   Wechsung did not say whether other arrests were expected.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen resigned as head of the company a year ago
and was arrested Oct. 5.
   A number of West German companies were invesitigated a little
more than a year ago after U.S. charges that German firms had
helped build the plant. Only Hippenstiel-Imhausen has been arrested.
   The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, quoting government
officials, reported Libya has ``blocked trade with West Germany
since last week'' to protest the fire, which caused severe damage
to the plant.
   Libyan exports to West Germany last year amounted to $1.85
billion, most of it oil. West German exports to Libya last year
were valued at $780 million.
   West German Ambassador Joerg Helmer went to the Libyan foreign
office in Tripoli ``to express our displeasure'' with the Libyan
actions, said a government official in Bonn.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonmymity, said Libya
had also barred a ship carrying Libyan oil from reaching its
destination in West Germany.

   The speaker of the Legislature broke his
walnut gavel, but he still needed the attention of his 48
colleagues. So, he wielded a meat cleaver Thursday.
   And members of the unicameral Legislature paid attention.
   After two days of heated debate, a school financing bill had
just been passed Wednesday when Speaker Bill Barrett began his
annual ``get serious speech'' about what he expected during the
last 10 working days of the two-month session.
   He banged the gavel to quiet the noisy chamber and the handle of
the walnut hammer split, throwing the heavy head to the floor with
an extra crash.
   Undaunted, the ever businesslike Barrett continued.
   ``There are those of you who are concerned that your priority
bills may not be handled, and that's entirely possible, even
likely,'' he said.
   ``I ask you to exercise self-discipline. The clock is running
very rapidly. I ask you to use discretion and pull amendments you
might have to bills ... use some restraint in asking to be excused
from the floor.
   ``Consider your colleagues in these final few days,'' he said.
   He cautioned that the last few days could be long.
   ``I ask for your consideration. The session still has some
possibilities,'' Barrett said.
   Attempting to lighten things up, he added, ``I do this in a
spirit of Christian love and all that. We're all concerned. I had
hoped I wouldn't have to give this speech this year.''
   On Thursday, after he raised the meat cleaver, lawmakers decided
to work through the lunch.

   IRS employees are answering correctly 78
percent of telephoned tax questions they address this year but
barely one-third of calls are being answered at all, government
auditors said Thursday.
   The accuracy rate is up significantly from 66 percent last year,
the General Accounting Office told the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee. But at this time a year ago, 61 percent of
callers were getting through to the IRS, compared with 34 percent
this year.
   ``It makes me sick'' that taxpayer service has declined, IRS
Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told the subcommittee.
   He blamed a budget squeeze and a sharply higher number of calls
for the problem. Goldberg said service will deteriorate further and
tax collections will suffer unless Congress approves the full $6.1
billion IRS budget that President Bush proposed for the 12 months
that begin Oct. 1.
   ``If they cut our budget $200 million, it's going to cost the
federal government $550 million in 1991,'' Goldberg said.
   Further overhaul of the IRS' 1960s-era computers is essential,
he said, and the 1991 budget will not make up for shortages of
previous years.
   ``I am afraid that the tax system will continue to pay the price
of the 1989-1990 hiring freeze and failure to provide adequate
training and support for our employees for years to come,''
Goldberg said.
   Goldberg and Jennie S. Stathis, tax-policy director of GAO, an
arm of Congress, agreed that the IRS is having a generally
successful return-filing season despite a lack of money.
   Ms. Stathis cited these figures:
   _GAO telephoned 20 tax questions to 29 IRS offices and scored
1,261 responses; 78 percent were correct.
   _Through March 17, taxpayers had called the IRS 31.5 million
times and the IRS had answered 10.7 million of the calls. During a
similar period last year, the number of attempted calls was far
less _ 19.3 million _ but 11.8 million were answered.
   _Chances of getting through on the first try have dropped to 55
percent from 69 percent last year.
   _Processing of returns is 12.5 percent ahead of last year's
pace; returns received are up 3.5 percent; the number of refunds is
up 16.7 percent.
   _The number of returns with taxpayer errors or IRS processing
mistakes is dropping, from 16 percent last year to 14 percent this
year. The IRS says taxpayers are responsible for about six of every
10 errors.
   _IRS forms and publications are more readily available this
year. A check of 13 walk-in sites found 10 were missing five or
fewer of 82 required items; the worst case was one site missing
eight items.
   _Ordering forms and publications by phone can be as troublesome
as telephoning a tax question. But once a caller connects, the IRS
is prompt in mailing requested items within the promised 14 days.
The agency is not as reliable for items ordered by letter.
   Members of the Ways and Means subcomittee were concerned that
the percentage of taxpayers being audited continues to decline, to
only about 9 per 1,000 returns this year.
   ``Congress may be forced to mandate a minimum audit level,''
said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the panel.
   Goldberg argued against any minimum level but said that with a
larger budget, the IRS might be able to boost the current level to
about 13 per 1,000 by 1993. He noted that about 40 million
individual returns, whose incomes are solely from wages, interest
and dividends, receive the equivalent of an audit every year
through a computer matching program.
   The commissioner said the IRS computer system and a complex tax
law are imposing an intolerable burden on the public.
   ``The greatest challenge of the coming decade is to make the
system more workable for the tens of millions of taxpayers who are
willing to pay what they owe, but cannot abide the complexity,
uncertainty and administrative hassles they face in complying with
the law and in dealing with the IRS,'' Goldberg said.

   Eleanor Mondale, daughter of the former vice
president, resigned from her job as a TV entertainment reporter
just days before a local magazine was due to publish an article
called, ``Walter and Joan's Wild Child.''
   Ms. Mondale denied she was forced out after only eight months at
WCCO-TV, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Thursday.
   ``I'm not upset,'' she said Wednesday. ``I had to make some
decisions on how I want to live my life (with) people in my face.''
   ``The resignation is definitely her choice,'' said WCCO news
director John Culliton. ``She may have a lot of reasons mixed in
there about how she feels about us, but it is her choice.''
   ``There is a lot of nervousness at WCCO about what it says and
how it portrays her,'' said MPLS.ST.PAUL magazine editor, Brian
Anderson.
   ``I've done a lot of stuff,'' Ms. Mondale is quoted as saying in
the article. ``I like to get wild. But it's not murder, and I don't
do drugs. I hear stuff about me dating everyone in town, and that's
really unfair. I'm new in town, I'm single, and my job is to know
this city and know people. So what am I supposed to do? Never go
out?''
   ``I think she's portrayed very positively,'' Anderson said of
the article that hits the streets next week. ``It looks at her
career and some of the rumors about her and her performance.''

<HEAD>Moscow Newspaper Reveals Soviet Role in Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wartime records concealed for decades show that
Soviet secret police, not German invaders, murdered thousands of
Polish officers in the Katyn pine forest of western Russia, a
newspaper reported.
   The weekly Moscow News used information from official records in
a two-page article about the Katyn Forest massacre, one of the
grisliest chapters of the Stalin era.
   Official Soviet accounts have said it was the Germans who mowed
down the cream of the Polish officer corps, held prisoner just
south of Smolensk.
   Articles published previously have demanded the truth about
Katyn, but none documented the Soviet role in the deaths of
thousands of Poles.
   Katyn fostered a deep distrust of the Soviets in Poland, even
during the four decades it spent as a client state of the Kremlin.
A Polish-Soviet commission investigated the massacre but did not
issue a formal report.
   Moscow News concluded the Polish officers were killed in the
spring of 1940, well before the Germans invaded the region, not in
1941 as the official version has claimed.
   ``Familiarity with the whole set of documents allows one to come
to the conclusion that the Polish officers and police were shot in
April and May by units of the NKVD,'' a precursor of the KGB, it
said. The article was based on research by historian Natalia
Lebedeva.
   Hitler's army invaded western Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, starting
World War II. Weeks later, the Red Army marched into eastern Poland
and remained there until the Germans pushed them out in 1941.
   The newspaper indicated up to 15,000 Polish officers were killed
when the NKVD evacuated three prison camps.
   Most estimates of the number of victims at Katyn hover around
4,000. Lebedeva's reference apparently was to a general operation
that included execution sites other than the forest.
   ``Soon I came to understand that this was not a coincidental
action but a well-thought-through and carefully planned
operation,'' said Lebedeva, who used central national archives and
Soviet Army records in her research.
   She said it appeared the camps were needed to hold thousands of
people who would be deported from the three Baltic states _ Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia _after Soviet troops moved into them.
   The Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic republics, to the northwest
of Katyn, in 1940 under a secret agreement with Germany that
divided Eastern Europe into Soviet and German spheres of influence.
   In the past year or two, Katyn Forest has become a pilgrimage
site for Poles and a group calling itself Families of Katyn Victims
has thousands of members.
   Lists published in the Moscow News implicate dozens of Soviet
secret police, army and government officials in the massacre,
including Stalin and Lavrenti Beria, head of the NKVD.
   Stalin appeared to have held a special grudge against the Polish
officers, the article said, because ``his vanity was hurt'' by the
Polish defeat of Soviet troops two decades earlier.
   Lebedeva said older archivists told her the NKVD tried to take
over the Katyn files in the 1940s, but failed. She acknowledged
finding the name Katyn only once in the files, but said the routes
to the points where mass graves have been found were laid out
clearly.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland has said the full
story of the massacre must be told if there to be true friendship
between Poland and the Soviet Union.
   A monument at the site of the mass grave in Katyn gives the
official Soviete version of events, honoring the ``victims of
fascism _ Polish officers shot by the Nazis in 1941.''
   The Germans found the mass graves in 1943 and immediately blamed
the Soviet Union, but the Soviets said the Nazis murdered the men
in 1941, during the German march on Moscow.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
Polish leader, established the commission of Soviet and Polish
historians in 1987. Last year, the Polish members said documents
indicated there was no doubt the Soviets were responsible for the
Katyn massacre.

   Representatives of the three largest unions
representing government employees criticized on Thursday a Bush
administration proposal to link pay raises to job performance.
   ``I believe that we have been performing since 1977 without any
consequent pay,'' said Robert M. Tobias, president of the
140,000-member National Treasury Employees Union, after testifying
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   The committee is considering legislation by Committee Chairman
John Glenn, D-Ohio, aimed at closing the gap between lower-paid
government workers and their higher-paid counterparts in private
industry. A 1989 report by the government puts the gap at 29
percent.
   Tobias was referring to a 1970 law that requires the
administration to keep federal salaries in line with private pay. A
Congressional Research Service Report that was released at the
Glenn hearing said the ``process broke down in 1978.''
   Tobias testified, and the report said, that Presidents Reagan
and Bush have consistently authorized amounts lower than
recommended by the Labor Department, Office of Management and
Budget and Office of Personnel Management.
   ``As a result I can't trust the administration to come up with a
fair and just pay-for-performance situation given its past
behavior,'' Tobias said in the interview.
   Bush said Thursday that he has not formally approved the
proposal to link raises to performance. But he said the notion has
his ``strong support.''
   The OPM, which handles personnel matters for the federal
bureaucracy, plans to ask for congressional authority to do away
with the ``step'' salary system that awards a pay increase every
year, OPM spokesman Richard McGowan said Wednesday night.
   James N. Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, and James M. Peirce, president
of the 150,000-member National Federation of Federal Employees,
both said the notion of pay-for-performance has been around for a
long time.
   ``We thought we were going to have some substantive proposals
from the administration to reform federal pay,'' said Sturdivant in
an interview after his testimony. ``Instead we basically get
warmed-over proposals that ... have nothing to do with the pay
problems were dealing with.''
   Elaborating on his committee testimony, Sturdivant said the
administration cannot improve pay for federal employees without
budgeting money for increases. The administration, he said, has
been taking pay out of agency budgets.
   ``You can't reform the federal pay system without putting more
money into it,'' he said. ``And basically what they're saying is,
`We're going to reform it but we're going to save money.'''
   Peirce said a merit pay system exists to reward performance.
``All we need to do is follow what we're supposed to be doing and
we'll have it, pure and simple,'' he said.
   The administration proposal would divide government employees
into two classes: one covering professional and administrative
workers and the other including technicians and clerks, McGowan
said.
   Technicians and clerks would get annual step increases until
they reach the average local salary for their jobs, after which
they would have to win merit increases just like professional and
administrative employees.
   Federal pay ranges from $10,600 to $87,000 a year and is
generally uniform regardless of whether an employee lives in Boston
or Cleveland, on the East Coast or in the Midwest.
   Glenn has introduced legislation that would make government pay
comparable to private pay, index annual raises to an employment
cost formula, and assure that the budget earmarks money for pay.

<HEAD>Bush Asks Congress to Back $35 Million for Tree Planting Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Congress Thursday to
approve a $35 million National Tree Trust to promote community tree
planting projects and ``knock Johnny Appleseed out of the Guinness
Book of Records.''
   Bush publicized his legislation by joining his wife Barbara at a
ceremony to plant a tree on the South Lawn of the White House.
   Bush sent Congress legislation to implement part of his
``America the Beautiful'' proposal that seeks $175 million overall
for a National Tree Planting and Forest Improvement Program. The
program's goal is to plant 1 billion trees a year on private lands.
   The private foundation the president proposes would use $35
million in federal funds and would help raise private contributions
for tree preservation and planting projects.
   Other parts of the tree plan include use of Agriculture
Department technical resources to help state forestry agencies and
others plant and maintain trees in rural and urban areas. ``By
planting trees in all 50 states, we'll knock Johnny Appleseed out
of the Guinness Book of Records,'' Bush said at the tree-planting
ceremony.
   He planted a eastern red bud blossoming tree near a sturdy tree
planted by President Eisenhower in the 1950s.
   Bush noted the enviromental benefits of trees, saying his act
would plant trees to help clean the air, prevent erosion, consume
carbon dioxide and purify the water.
   ``This act can preserve the heritage of trees: their beauty that
is breathtaking, and their bointy that is breathgiving,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Airport, Eagles on Collision Course</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of bald eagles is on a collision course
with Denver's new $2.3 billion airport, and conservationists say
the eagles and 330 other bird species that nest at Barr Lake State
Park could be in danger.
   Conservationists and wildlife officials want Denver
International Airport to establish a buffer-zone nature sanctuary
to prevent houses, offices and shops from sprouting up on its
northwestern fringes near Barr Lake.
   The airport, which opens up in 1993, won't pay.
   ``We don't feel we should,'' said airport director Bill Smith.
``We aren't adding anything to the problems in the area, and we're
not increasing any problems that exist.''
   Wildlife experts are surprised that the birds chose to nest just
18 miles from downtown Denver, and 3 miles northwest of the airport.
   The eagles were the first on record to nest and to colonize on
the Rocky Mountains' eastern slopes in 1986. Previously, the
eastern Colorado Front Range served only as a resting stop for
eagles migrating south from Canada toward Mexico, New Mexico and
Texas for the winter.
   The birth of two eaglets last year drew numerous bird watchers.
The eaglets later flew off, and wildlife officials are hopeful they
will soon return to nest.
   ``There are only 10 bald eagle nesting sites in the whole state,
and only one along the Front Range,'' said Mike Carter, director of
the Colorado Bird Observatory. ``Don't airport officials understand
the principle of the straw that broke the camel's back?''
   Carter worried that the airport will destroy a unique
opportunity for the endangered bald eagles to grab a foothold if it
refuses to help out.
   If the worst happens, the construction of the airport's fringe
developments would at least enable observers to document the
destruction of a bird refuge, he said.
   ``There have been very few studies with 80 to 90 years of
records, and this could be our first chance to document these
changes,'' Carter said. ``I don't see that as a benefit. This could
destroy 100 years worth of resources.''
   The airport already has concluded in a $35,000 study that,
because of the airport's noise regulations, incoming planes won't
pose a threat. But construction near Barr Lake may drive the birds
away, Carter said.
   Barr Lake Park is made up of 2,000 acres of water and two narrow
strips on land on each side that measure 700 acres. Wildlife
records from the area have been kept since 1909, and 330 species
are documented.
   Warning signs prohibit entry to the eagles' nesting area, and
violators face a $20,000 fine and a year's imprisonment. But
outdoors enthusiasts can cross a narrow ridge and watch the birds
through binoculars.
   The Denver Audubon Society and Colorado Department of Natural
Resources wants the airport to put aside some of its discretionary
funds for wildlife conservation to buy a 2,000-acre buffer zone
around the lake, or buy development rights to prevent construction
there.
   The land's cost has not been determined.
   ``All the buffer zone will do is keep developers away from the
lake,'' said its chairwoman, Polly Reetz. ``In addition to the
eagles, we have a lot of animals that move in and out, and raptors
that hunt in fields adjacent to the park.''
   Carter, of the Colorado Bird Observatory, would prefer a
wildlife sanctuary on the airport grounds, a 2,000-foot-wide zone
stretching from the airport to the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal,
which already serves as a wildlife refuge.
   Denver planners are negotiating with the Army, which owns the
arsenal, to move fences and allow bike trails in the area to take
advantage of Arsenal wildlife, which include antelope, deer and
coyotes.
   The airport is being constructed to replace Denver's Stapleton
International, one of the nation's busiest. It will occupy 50
square miles, and its main terminal will be heavily landscaped with
greenery to promote the image of an oasis on the Plains. Indoor
waterfalls and fountains also are planned.
   Carter said that without action, development will occur around
the lake because of plans to complete a beltway around Denver. But
he thinks the state and conservation groups should share with the
airport the cost of protecting the birds and other wildlife.
   Park spokeswoman Carol Leasure said farmers and landowners
should not be penalized if airport-fringe developments are deferred.
   ``We want to see that they're fairly compensated, too,'' she
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Probes Transer of Soviet Missiles to Czechoslovakia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is investigating the
possibility that Soviet SS-23 medium-range missiles, banned by a
1987 treaty, may have been illegally transferred to Czechoslovakia,
the State Department said Thursday.
   The department earlier had disclosed it is looking into the
possibility that SS-23 missiles may also have been transfered to
the East German armed forces.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the key question is whether the
missiles, if any, were transfered before or after the signing of
the Intermediate Nuclear Forces or INF treaty in December 1987.
   If the weapons were transferred before the treaty was signed by
former President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
they are not covered by the pact, Boucher said.
   If they were transferred after it was signed, the transfer
violates the treaty, he said.
   ``That's the point that we're looking into,'' Boucher said. ``I
don't have a judgment on that. That's the key point as to whether
they are covered by the treaty or not, whether they were transfered
before or after. And that's where we have to satisfy ourselves in
order to make a judgment.''
   ``We've asked the Czech government for further information on
the possible presence of SS-23 missiles in Czechoslovakia,''
Boucher said. ``As we've said before, we regard this as a serious
matter.''
   The treaty applies to U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles and
specifically prohibits the transfers of such weapons after the
treaty was signed.
   He said the United States has raised the question of the
possible illegal transfer and possession of banned medium-range
missiles not only with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and East
Germany but with certain other nations as well. He did not identify
them.
   Asked if the Soviets had ever pledged not to transfer missiles
before the treaty was signed as a gesture of good faith, Boucher
said the department is ``still analyzing records of the
discussions.''
   Although Boucher said the United States is not prepared to
disclose how many suspect missiles may be involved, The Washington
Times reported that the Czech government told the United States two
weeks ago that more than 70 SS-23 missiles with a range of about
310 miles are deployed within its territory and are being
dismantled.
   The INF treaty bans all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of
between 300 and 3,400 miles.
   The possible presence of prohibited SS-23 missiles in East
Germany and Czechoslovakia has caused alarm among administration
officials who fear the incidents could damage prospects for
succesfully ratifying a treaty making sharp reductions in
long-range, intercontinental missiles.

   A drug that eases the heart's workload can
cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in
people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study
released Thursday.
   The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil,
known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years
after a heart attack. Calcium blockers are among several classes of
medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.
   ``This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker
may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction,'' or heart
attack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.
   Several other studies of calcium blockers, including one large
U.S. study published last year, failed to find any benefit from
using the medicines after heart attacks.
   According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective
as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta
blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
   While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart
attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a role
in treatment.
   ``We feel it is important to have alternatives. Many patients do
not tolerate beta blockers,'' said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard of
Central County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of the
study.
   Beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with
asthma and emphysema. This means the drugs often cannot be given to
cigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks.
   In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors
compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with
878 people who took placebos.
   After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurring
heart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 in
people who got the dummy medication.
   ``We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with
Verapamil,'' said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal
Hospital.
   ``If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18
months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial
infarction in this period,'' he said. ``Then it levels off. That's
what we demonstrated. It worked.''
   The researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work
needed by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockers
lowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's own
muscle is deprived of oxygen.
   They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show
any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks. However,
they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking
beta blockers. And this might have obscured any benefits from
calcium blockers.
   The results were presented at a meeting of the American College
of Cardiology. Among other research described at the meeting:
   _Dr. James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year study
found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing
blockages in the arteries feeding the heart, although it may
modestly protect against the development of new deposits. However,
like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cut
the risk of heart attacks.
   _Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the next
phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what
effect they have in unstable angina. This is a condition in which
people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work
or stress. Until now, the drugs have been used only to treat heart
attacks.

   President Bush is counting on the Soviet Union
to limit its borrowing from a development bank being proposed to
finance a Marshall Plan-type rebuilding of Eastern Europe,
administration officials said Thursday.
   The administration has said the United States will participate
in the $12 billion European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
only if Soviet borrowing is limited to what Moscow contributes in
capital and then only for loans to develop private enterprises.
   Under Secretary of the Treasury David Mulford said the Soviets
are aware of U.S. concerns after meetings between the top finance
and banking officials of the two countries here last week.
   He said the administration was eagerly awaiting counterproposals
from Moscow before an April 8-9 meeting in Paris to put the final
touches on chartering the $12 billion multinational development
bank.
   ``We've said that if the Soviet position cannot be worked out,
we will not join the bank,'' Mulford told a Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee. ``Our ability and willingness to make any
further compromises would be extremely limited and perhaps
nonexistent.''
   The administration already has made several concessions in
establishing the bank. When the idea was first proposed in January
by French President Francois Mitterrand, the United States wanted a
$5 billion bank devoted solely to lending for private enterprise in
Eastern Europe _ with the Soviet Union excluded from participation.
   In six negotiating sessions since then, administration officials
have bowed to allowing the proposed bank to lend 40 percent of its
funds for government infrastructure improvements such as roads.
   The administration also has softened its demand that the
borrowing countries must turn state-run enterprises such as
utilities into private businesses to qualify for loans financing
their improvement.
   House Democrats have criticized Bush's insistence on a
diminished Soviet role in the bank as a continuation of ``Cold War
politics'' that will only decrease U.S. ability to shape events in
the region and freeze American companies out of the newly freed
markets.
   In the Senate, Democrats have muted their criticism while
including $1.2 billion as the United States' 10 percent share of
the new bank as part of legislation to provide $2 billion in new
aid to seven East European countries.
   ``There are going to be big problems up here on the Soviet
issue,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and chairman of the Senate
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, told Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady on Thursday. ``Frankly, it's going to
happen whether we join or not and we need to be in on it if we are
going to influence how things go over there.''
   While both Brady and Mulford expressed optimism that an accord
can be reached for U.S. participation in the European bank, new
challenges to it surfaced Thursday from the president's own party.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., said he and Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas would introduce a bill to, instead, establish a
new facility in the World Bank devoted to lending for private
enterprise in Eastern Europe.
   ``The U.S. should boycott the Eastern European bank altogether
if the bank's charter allows any Soviet borrowing,'' Kasten said.
``This bank will be dominated by European policy makers ... (who)
still believe that socialism can be reformed ... and that
government action raises living standards.''
   Brady expressed skepticism at Kasten's plan, saying the United
States would have less leverage both politically and economically
under such a scheme. He also acknowledged that a bank without a
U.S. role could become a public relations fiasco for the
administration.
   ``Could you imagine what the headlines would read all over the
world'' if the United States pulls out of the bank? Brady asked at
one point.

<HEAD>Troops Kill Two Palestinians</HEAD>

   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians in the
West Bank city of Nablus on Thursday, firing on them when one
pulled out what appeared to be a grenade, an army spokesman said.
   The object turned out to be a tear gas canister, the spokesman
said.
   Witnesses told Arab reporters an army unit fired on the men
during a raid organized to capture Palestinian militants in the
city's Casbah, a market area of twisting, narrow passages where
activists in the 27-month Palestinian uprising often evade troops.
   Two Palestinians were captured in the raid, including one
suspected in the deaths of seven Arabs accused of collaborating
with Israel, the military said.
   The two deaths raised to 669 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers and civilians during the uprising against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   An army statement said an army patrol opened fire on the men
after they refused orders to stop.
   ``One of the two killed drew a grenade and the other charged an
(army) force. No weapons were found on them afterward, but they
tried to attack the force,'' an unidenitified army officer said on
army radio.
   After the shootings, masked youths stoned soldiers in the city
of Nablus and three nearly Palestinian refugee camps. The army put
Nablus and the camps under curfew, Arab reports said.
   Palestinians said soldiers also carried out a three-hour search
of apartments and shops, dumping rice, sugar and flour on the
floors of some homes and forcing families to stand outside.
   Also in the West Bank, Havakuk Levinson, a photographer for the
Reuters news agency, was beaten by soldiers when he tried to
photograph troops firing on stone-throwing youngsters in Ramallah.
   Nachman Shai, the army spokesman, issued an official apology for
the attack.
   Arieh Goos, a reporter for Israel radio who witnessed the
attack, said soldiers beat and kicked Levinson and shouted ``You
have to kill all the journalists and then kill the Arabs!''
   The Palestinians shot to death were identified by the army as
Nasser Al Kaneer, 28, and Ibrahim Abu Ghadib, 19.

<HEAD>Report: Mann Resigned Because WHO Chief Blocked Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann said in an interview published
Thursday that he quit as director of the World Health
Organization's AIDS program because his superior's attitude slowed
or blocked work intended to combat the disease.
   ``The lack of commitment of the director-general in putting into
action the world program in the fight against AIDS became a
fundamental question for me,'' Mann was quoted as saying by the
newspaper Le Monde. He said he was constantly confronted by an
``administrative wall'' in trying to carry out programs.
   On Wednesday, WHO named Dr. Michael H. Merson, another American,
as Mann's replacement.
   Mann headed WHO's program on acquired immune deficiency syndrome
since 1986. In his March 16 letter of resignation to WHO's
director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, Mann cited ``a great
variance between our positions on a series of issues,'' but he did
not elaborate.
   The outgoing director was quoted by Le Monde as saying the
61-year-old Nakajima's attitude ``completely paralyzed our
efforts.''
   ``Today, it is practically impossible to translate words into
concrete action,'' Mann contended in the interview.
   ``The action of the director-general is not at the level of the
principles established by WHO,'' Mann was quoted as saying.
   Mann, 42, said he believed WHO should play a leadership role on
the issue of access by all AIDS patients _ not just those with the
economic means _ to medication. He noted that in Brazzaville,
Congo, a global commission on AIDS adopted such a program in May.
   ``Since then, nothing. So many times I begged the
director-general _ I use the word by design _ so that he would take
action toward this end. No, no, no reaction. Great principles are
good, but one must know how to put them into action,'' Mann said.
   Responding to suggestions that competition between the two men
may have been at the center of the conflict, he told Le Monde:
   ``Perhaps that is the case. All I know is there are other ways
to avoid hampering the action of a global program for two years.''
   When Mann joined WHO nearly four years ago, its AIDS program
consisted of him and a secretary, with funds coming from the
regular WHO budget. The program now has a staff of close to 200
people and a special budget that has tripled in the past three
years to $109 million. He traveled widely to push a worldwide
campaign to inform people of the dangers of AIDS and the methods of
protection.
   Since the resignation was announced, Mann and Nakajima have
declined requests for interviews with The Associated Press.
   In a statement last week, Nakajima said he regretted Mann's
resignation. He said it ``happened without previous consultation at
a time when the organization is confronted with new challenges
concerning the fight against AIDS.''

<HEAD>Whites Life Expectancy Greater Than Blacks, Report Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High homicide rates, AIDS and lack of medical
care are continuing to cut short the lives of black Americans,
while the health of whites is improving, a government report said
Thursday.
   While whites can expect to live to the age of 75.5, life
expectancy for blacks is 69.5, and for black males it is 65.1,
according to the study.
   ``This concerns us greatly,'' said Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   ``We need to move toward equal health opportunity for our
citizens _ including the good health information and the family and
community support that will help every American make the right
choices for health and productive lives,'' he said.
   Healthier living _ quitting smoking, using seat belts, reducing
violence and eating more nutritiously _ is the key to improving
health, since more than half the causes of premature death are
related to lifestyle, he said.
   ``We have the data to show this pays off. This will have more
effect than any of our (medical) research,'' he said.
   However, he added that while ``lifestyle changes are easily
articulated as a goal, ... what we don't have enough information on
yet is how do we most effectively get the information across and
have people act on it.''
   The study, Health United States 1989, is the 14th annual report
of the health status of the nation.
   Overall, the country improved its infant mortality rate slightly
to 9.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1988, although this rate
still ranks the United States behind 21 other nations and the gap
between whites and blacks is widening.
   White infants died at the rate of 8.6 per 1,000 live births in
1987, down 0.3 points from 1986. During the same period, the rate
for black babies dropped only slightly and at 17.9 per 1,000 births
is more than twice as high as for whites.
   Dramatic declines in deaths from heart disease, down 33 percent
between 1970 and 1987, and stroke, which was cut in half during the
period, contributed to the increased longevity of Americans.
   But the gains weren't shared equally: The decline was greatest
among white men, 35 percent, followed by 31 percent for white
women, 28 percent for black women and 24 percent for black men. And
in 1987, the death rate for stroke was twice as high among blacks
as whites.
   Health experts say the gaps are not always explained with
behaviors, such as smoking, diet, homicide and other lifestyle
factors.
   Indeed, studies show that regardless of the age, education or
marital status of the mother and whether she had early pre-natal
care, black woman are generally twice as likely to have a low
birth-weight baby, a key factor in infant mortality, Sullivan said.
   Also, some of the disparity in deaths from stroke cannot be
explained by lifestyle, he said.
   The decline in cigarette smoking is accelerating, Sullivan said.
From 1985 to 1988, cigarette sales dropped about 2 percent a year,
but decreased 6 percent from 1988 to 1989.
   However, from 1970 to 1987, lung cancer _ the leading cause of
death among women _ increased by 31 percent for white women and 25
percent for black women.
   In 1987, homicide took the lives of seven times more black males
than white males, while the homicide rate for black females was
more than four times that for white females.
   Blacks were also lagging in the proportion of mothers receiving
prenatal care in the first three months of pregnancy. For blacks,
the proportion was 61 percent in 1987, compared with 60 percent for
American Indians, 76 percent of Asian and Pacific Islanders and 79
percent for white women.
   A growing number of blacks are being diagnosed with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, increasing from 25 percent to 29
percent of all AIDS cases between 1984 and 1988. As of last
September, blacks made up 55 percent of all AIDS cases among
children under age 13, and Hispanics accounted for 21 percent.

<NOTE>EDs: Adds 4 grafs with comment on Contra demobilization</NOTE>

   President Bush, acknowledging congressional
resistance to freeing $800 million for his Panama and Nicaragua aid
program, urged lawmakers Thursday to let him make the Pentagon cuts
needed to provide the money.
   He said several members of Congress have told him it would be
difficult to get Congress to pass the aid package in the face of
other budgetary priorities.
   ``But I am going to continue to reiterate the importance, not
just to the United States but to the whole hemisphere, of the aid
package that I have requested,'' Bush said.
   His request includes $300 million in economic assistance for
Nicaragua, long suffering under a U.S. trade embargo.That includes
$30 million to help resettle the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who
fought for a decade against the leftist government just voted out
of office.
   The other $500 million would go to help Panama recover from the
U.S. military invasion in December and the economic sanctions
imposed by the United States against the regime of Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Bush decried sentiments that aid to Panama and Nicaragua should
take a back seat to helping the emerging democracies of Eastern
Europe.
   ``There are those that argue that Panama and Nicaragua are not
as vital as Eastern Europe. They're wrong,'' he told a news
conference. ``This is our hemisphere. And we have a strong aid
program for Eastern Europe and will continue to do so. And we can
do no less for our own neighbors.''
   However, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid, has said that Congress
should look at the president's request in terms of a choice between
two small countries, on the one hand, or all of Eastern Europe, on
the other.
   Bush said one senator told him, ``It would be a very difficult
sell.''
   ``I don't understand it,'' the president added, ``because I
think the United States has a disproportionate role ... in the
evolution of democracy'' in Panama and Nicargua.
   ``We've got a lot at stake in both countries.''
   Bush sent Congress the aid request last week, saying that the
money should be taken from the Defense Department budget.
   He directed his Office of Management and Budget and
representatives of the Defense Department to negotiate with the
defense appropriations subcommittees of the House and Senate on
where the cuts should be made.
   So far no resolution has been reached.
   ``If we are unable to to resolve our differences regarding
offsets, then I would be happy to have Congress authorize me to
select the offsets from the defense budget in order to get economic
assistance moving in the region,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, at the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher criticized the Sandinista government for refusing to allow
Contra leaders to fly to Managua for discussions on demobilization
and repatriation.
   ``We find this refusal inconsistent with the Sandinistas' own
professed desire for national reconciliation and for a successful
demobilization process,'' he said.
   Boucher said the rebel leaders want to arrange talks with church
leaders and with aides to President-elect Violeta Chamorro but that
the Sandinista Interior Ministry has not given them permission to
enter Nicaragua.
   Thousands of Contra rebels remain at camps in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border.

   The small white madonna is still nestled
outside the brown-shingled duplex where Carol DiMaiti Stuart grew
up and where her parents and aunt still live. But six months after
her slaying, no one answers the door.
   The same is true a few miles away on Lowe Street in Revere,
where the parents of Charles Stuart have maintained a silence about
the horrifying crime that riveted the nation.
   Boston police, citing an ongoing grand jury investigation, have
remained almost as closemouthed as the families.
   The case that took a shocking twist Jan. 4, when Charles Stuart
apparently jumped to his death from the Tobin Bridge, remains a
mystery.
   ``There are a hell of a lot more holes in this story than solid
information,'' said Ken Englade, an Albuquerque, N.M.-based writer
whose paperback, `Murder in Boston,' is due in bookstores at the
end of the month. ``It doesn't help that nobody is talking.''
   Englade said he was frustrated by the refusal of Boston police
and Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan to disclose
information about the case. They also have withheld medical reports.
   More baffling is the prosecutor's refusal to release tapes of
the lineup where Charles Stuart allegedly identified William
Bennett as his assailant.
   And even though life insurance money was thought to be Stuart's
motive, only $280,000 in life insurance money was apparently taken
out on his wife's life. The two $100,000 policies purchased by
Stuart were ``barely enough to cover the mortgage on their house,''
Englade said. Carol Stuart was insured for $80,000 through her work.
   Based on his research, Englade said he is not convinced Stuart
actually killed his wife or even if he jumped off the bridge
voluntarily. He cited numerous contradictions in the case _ even in
the hours before Stuart's apparent suicide when he left
instructions with a hotel clerk to rouse him at 4:30 a.m.
   ``Who leaves a wake-up call to commit suicide?'' Englade
asserted.
   The only person associated with the tragedy who is willing to
talk is Carol's 37-year-old brother, Carl DiMaiti, a former high
school teacher who has taken over the family's pizza dough
business. He heads the scholarship foundation established in
Carol's name for residents in Boston's Mission Hill district where
she was shot. So far, the foundation has received more than
$340,000.
   This week found him in a familiar setting: accepting a donation
for the foundation at an inner city outreach center. He is usually
accompanied by two public relations agent who monitor his remarks.
   DiMaiti said Thursday his family's ordeal has been eased
considerably by their work with the foundation.
   ``I'm amazed that people have gone out of their way and
responded like this,'' he said. ``It shows the deep well of
goodness in people. It's been a very difficult time for us. This
has especially helped my mother and father through a very tough
time.''
   Their ordeal began the night of Oct. 23 when Boston police
received a frantic call over a car phone from Stuart. He said he
and his wife had been shot by a black gunman who robbed them
shortly after they left a childbirth class at a hospital in Mission
Hill.
   Carol Stuart, a 30-year-old tax attorney who was seven months
pregnant, was shot in the head. She died a few hours later after
her son, Christopher, was prematurely delivered. The baby died 17
days later.
   Stuart, 30-year-old manager of a fur store, was shot in the
stomach and remained hospitalized until December. His body was
recovered from the waters of Boston Harbor the day after his
younger brother, Matthew, told police he had been enlisted by
Charles to aid in the crime.
   Since then, a grand jury has met seven times to hear testimony
in the case, according to Dave Rodman, spokesman for the district
attorney's office. Stuart's siblings and his mother have appeared
before the grand jury. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said several witnesses are still scheduled to testify.
   The families have picked up the pieces of their lives in various
ways. Carol's mother, Evelyn DiMaiti, 58, has returned to her job
in a state office. Mrs. DiMaiti's husband, Giusto, 64, is retired
but can often be found at the family bakery in nearby Chelsea.
   Charles Stuart Sr., who suffers from Parkinson's disease, and
his wife, Dorothy, remain in seclusion at the home they share with
sons, Matthew and Mark. Matthew reportedly still holds his job as a
mixer at a paint factory and is a familiar figure on the streets of
Revere in his stone-washed jeans and leather jacket.
   In addition to the soon-to-be published paperback, at least two
hardback books and a CBS television movie are planned.
   Paul Corkery, a freelance writer and former editor of Boston
Magazine, has rented an apartment in Revere to work on his book for
Simon and Schuster. He said he has 50,000 words of notes, culled
mostly from interviews with friends and relatives outside the two
families.
   ``It's not a typical whodunit,'' said Corkery. ``It's the story
of a hero who turned out to be the villain.''

   Iranian Princess Safiyeh Firouz, an activist for
women's rights in her country under the Pahlavi dynasty, died this
week and was buried Thursday, family members said. She was 87.
   The princess, widow of Prince Mohammad Hussein Mirza Firouz of
the Qajar dynasty, died after being hospitalized Monday night with
heart trouble, a family member said.
   She was interred outside the French capital, where she had lived
in exile since the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   Princess Firouz fought in the 1940s for the right to vote for
Iranian women, at one point leading a march on the Majlis, the
Iranian Parliament. Opposed to wearing the veil, she established
the Council of Women in Iran in 1943.
   The princess' husband, a general, was the grandson of Qajar King
Muzaffar ud-Din Shah. The dynasty was overthrown in 1925 by Reza
Shah, father of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and founder of the
Pahlavi dynasty. The dynasty was toppled by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini in 1979.
   Prince Mirza Firouz died in 1983.

<HEAD>Bush Says Remark Did Not Affect Events in Israel</HEAD>

   President Bush on Thursday denied that a
remark by him had affected events in Israel, where the government
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir fell last week.
   ``I do not think it contributed to the fall of the government.
These are highly complex, internal matters in the state of
Israel,'' Bush told a news conference on the White House lawn.
   His comment March 3 about Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem
touched off a firestorm of controversy because U.S. officials have
previously shied away from including East Jerusalem when
complaining about Jewish settlements in the West Bank area.
   Bush, however, told reporters that ``the foreign policy of the
United States says we do not believe there should be new
settlements in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem.''
   He was asked Thursday if that statement had contributed to
destabilizing the Shamir government or the overall peace process.
   ``I don't believe it made a contribution because I think if you
look at the issues, both the domestic economy and the question of
the peace talks, that those were the key issues in the campaign.
Because most people in Israel understood that I was simply
reiterating a standing United States policy, one that I feel very
strongly about,'' Bush said.
   Most anaylsts believe his remark about East Jerusalem disrupted
progress in the fragile talks on Middle East peace.
   A key issue in trying to get Israel to the table with the
Palestinians has been who can represent the Palestinians and
whether some should be from East Jerusalem and the occupied West
Bank.
   Prospects for the talks are up in the air because political
crisis in Israel following Shamir's fall in the parliamentary
no-confidence motion last week.
   Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, is trying to
form a new government.

   When it comes to energy education, most
students know only how to save it, a poll showed Thursday.
   The National Energy Education Development Project said a poll of
25,000 American students in 32 states found most characterized
themselves as energy savers.
   Yet the results showed most of the students have great
difficulty understanding and identifying such basic concepts about
energy and the environment as estimated costs, efficiency factors,
predominant uses and properties of the nation's various fuel
sources.
   ``Students should know and care as much about the debate over
clean air as they do Air Jordans,'' said Gerard Katz, director of
the NEED Project. ``The assessment will provide a starting point so
we can better educate young people to make informed decisions about
the many complex energy issues facing our society.''
   The poll _ described as the only census of its kind _ was
released by the National Assessment Committee of the NEED Project
to mark the 10th anniversary since Congress and the White House
launched the project as a means to boost energy awareness among
consumers.
   The 11-question survey involved 12,326 middle grade students and
11,921 high school students, as well as about 2000 educators from
15 states. Students consistently scored about 10  Hazelwoods,'' Devins
said. The spill
showed that industry does not have the technology to deal with oil
spills of that magnitude, and that prevention must be stressed, he
said.
   ``The bad judgment and behavior of Joe Hazelwood in the initial
accident was eclipsed by the inept behavior, arrogance and bad
judgment of Exxon in their cleanup effort,'' said Ann Rothe, Alaska
regional representative for the National Wildlife Federation.
   It is Exxon that was to blame for the spill, not the captain,
she said.
   ``They let a man who couldn't get a driver's license to drive an
automobile captain one of their tankers. That's just negligence,''
said Rothe.

   Democratic Party officials, searching for a
winning strategy in the shadow of President Bush's formidable
approval ratings, are ready to endorse a cut in the Social Security
payroll tax.
   A resolution to put the party on record in support of a proposal
on that subject by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is on the
agenda Friday for the Democratic National Committee, meeting in
Indianapolis.
   The resolution, pushed by Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, is part
of a broad effort to persuade voters around the country that the
Democrats are the party that represents the middle class.
   But, as usual, the party is far from united. The Democratic
Leadership Council, dominated by elected officials, is gathering
half a continent away in New Orleans with its own avowed purpose of
setting the party's agenda for the 1990s and beyond.
   Before leaving for New Orleans, congressional Democrats released
what they called ``The New Orleans Declaration.'' The statement of
principles was aimed at moving the party from the left toward ``the
mainstream of America,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
DLC.
   It also calls for a reduction in the Social Security payroll
tax, but without specifically naming Moynihan's proposal.
   It also refers to another touchy issue, abortion, without
mentioning it by name: ``We believe government should respect
individual liberty and stay out of our private lives and personal
decisions.''
   Nunn said that was not a definitive statement on abortion ``but
certainly points in the direction of people making their own choice
on that.''
   Last year, the party won several important races, including
governor of Virginia, in campaigns emphasizing much clearer stands
in support of abortion rights.
   Striving to present a united Democratic front, party Chairman
Ronald Brown issued a statement from Indianapolis praising the
declaration put out by those headed for New Orleans.
   ``The ideas and principles in this document put Democrats
squarely on the side of working people,'' Brown said. ``On their
behalf, Democrats are leading this nation's most important debate _
shaping and designing America's future.''
   Officials of the DNC and the DLC insisted the scheduling
conflict that saw both groups meeting on identical days was an
accident. But the conflicting sessions reflected the internal
struggle for the future of the Democratic Party.
   The Democratic Leadership Council was formed by elected
officials, largely from the South and West, after Ronald Reagan's
49-state landslide re-election in 1984. The group's founders wanted
a counterweight to what they saw as the leftward drift of the
national party.
   The two meetings were certain to generate a lot of rhetoric but
whether any voters would hear it or care was another matter.
   ``Too often Democrats miss the mark by talking in the language
of the District of Columbia that is abstract and inside and doesn't
affect people either intellectually or touch them personally,''
said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
   Not only were the Democrats having trouble settling on a program
that would attract voters, they also were at odds over whether they
had anything to worry about.
   ``We've got real problems,'' said former party chairman John C.
White.
   But Robert Beckel, a Democratic political consultant, said,
``It's amazing there's this much handwringing going on when I think
things are trending considerably in the Democrats' direction.''
   In the meantime, Democrats are hardly showing enthusiasm for the
party's 1992 presidential nomination. At this stage in recent
presidential campaigns, the Democratic field was already well
established and crowded.
   Beckel said of Bush, ``They say he's 80 percent in the polls. If
you don't take him on, he's gong to stay 80 percent in the polls.''
   Pollster Peter Hart said Democrats who were making their 1992
plans based on Bush's 1990 poll ratings ``are making a dreadful
mistake. It's all going to change.''
   The Democrats' search for a message is typical of the agony of a
party out of power in the White House, where the president can set
the national agenda.
   ``They're having a very tough time because they don't have a
well-known figure,'' said Charles Black, a Republican consultant.
   While the two groups hold their rival debates, the
Democratic-controlled Congress has to deal directly with the
president and his administration, looking to put its stamp on
current issues.
   Moynihan's proposal was greeted with a flurry of criticism from
the White House and many Democrats decided it was best to keep
their distance.
   But the DNC has its eye on the voters, and in Moynihan's plan
those Democrats sniff an issue that just might catch hold.

   President Bush implored the Soviet Union
Thursday not to use force to block Lithuania's secession, but also
urged the breakaway republic to recognize ``certain realities'' of
Moscow's control.
   Commending the Kremlin for dealing peacefully with changes in
Eastern Europe, Bush said, ``Please continue to exercise that kind
of restraint. And remember _ no use of force.'' He said both sides
should negotiate their differences.
   Separately, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said any resort to
military might ``would do great violence'' to the reforms being
championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The president's comments came as Soviet armored personnel
carriers and trucks drove through the Lithuanian capital in a show
of force. Bush declined to criticize Gorbachev for demanding that
Lithuanians surrender their guns. ``They should talk about that,''
Bush said.
   Bush also refused to say how he would react if force were used.
``What possible good would come from the president of the United
States, standing halfway around the world, speculating on something
that he doesn't want to see happen.''
   He issued his plea for restraint during a 20-minute news
conference on the White House lawn.
   Bush stood beneath a towering oak tree and next to a flowering
eastern redbud tree that he and his wife, Barbara, had just planted.
   Commenting on two days of talks with visiting Polish Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bush said there was no need for Soviet
troops to be stationed in Poland or anywhere else in Eastern
Europe. ``And the sooner they get out of there, the better,'' he
said.
   Bush acknowledged ``a nuance of difference'' with Mazowiecki
over the prime minister's demands that the two Germanys sign a
treaty guaranteeing Polish borders before they unite. But he said
the Poles and Germans ``are very, very close now'' to an
understanding that the current borders must remain intact.
   On another sensitive foreign policy issue, Bush disputed
contentions that he contributed to the fall of the government of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir with comments linking Israeli
settlements in East Jerusalem with those in the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``Most people in Israel understood that I was simply reiterating
a standing United States policy, one that I feel very strong
about.''
   On other issues, Bush:
   _Said he wants a treaty to cut Soviet and American troops in
Europe to be ready by the time of his summit this summer with
Gorbachev in Washington. Another oficial said Bush had meant to say
he wanted to have a strategic-arms treaty ready by the summit. Bush
said the summit date had not been set but should be pinned down
soon.
   _Said he will not attend the April 25 inauguration of
U.S.-backed president-elect Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua but wants
to visit the country sometime.
   Responding to another question, Bush said ``I'm dying to go'' to
Australia and wants to make the trip before the end of the year. He
declined to say he would go to New Zealand during such a trip,
noting U.S. unhappiness over its refusal to permit American
warships carrying nuclear weapons in its waters.
   _Refused to discuss Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams' concerns about running against a woman. Calling
himself an expert on the subject because of his race against
Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, Bush said, ``I know exactly
what he means and I refuse to elaborate on it for fear of
complicating his life.''
   _Prodded Congress to speed approval of $800 million in aid for
Panama and Nicaragua.
   In recent days, the United States has expressed concern about
Soviet moves in Lithuania, which declared independence from Moscow
on March 11 after the ruling Communists were removed from power in
free elections. However, the United States has not extended formal
diplomatic recognition, saying Lithuania does not control its
territory.
   In his remarks, Bush noted that the United States had never
recognized the forced incorporation of Lithuania or the other
Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``However, there are certain realities in life,'' Bush said.
``The Lithuanians are well aware of them. And they should talk, as
they are, with the Soviet officials about these differences.''
   He said he was pleased that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze had said Moscow would not use force.
   ``It is very important that force not be used,'' Bush said.
``But I believe that they can talk and work out these problems.''
   Asked if he thought Gorbachev was guilty of intimidation by
demanding that Lithuanians surrender their arms, Bush said, ``I
would prefer to put emphasis on his statement that there will be no
use of force. And that's where I'm going to keep the emphasis and
keep reminding every party to this discussion over there _ no use
of force.''
   Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
Moscow's order to tighten visa controls in Lithuania and expel
foreigners ``contradicts the Soviets' commitment to a more open
society and to contact between countries.''
   ``We're concerned by the order to have internal security and
secret police troops seize private sporting guns unless they are
surrendered,'' he said, adding that the Soviets are trying to
suggest there is a threat to public order from Lithuanians.
   ``We believe, however, that the Lithuanians are committed to a
peaceful resolution of their differences with the Soviet Union. The
Lithuanian people have shown their commitment to non-violence and
democracy,'' Boucher said.

   He is not as notorious as Captain Bligh
or Captain Ahab, but Captain Joseph Hazelwood, former skipper of
the Exxon Valdez, has sailed unwillingly into America's lore of the
sea.
   While cartoonists sketched him as a liquor-swigging villain and
TV comics parodied the infamous grounding of his ship, the
passionately private Hazelwood returned to Alaska this winter, a
year after the nation's worst oil spill, determined to clear his
name.
   ``I'd like to get rid of the misconception that I got drunk, ran
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away,
because that's just not what happened,'' he said after the
grounding of the Exxon Valdez had tarred his reputation along with
hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   On Thursday, a jury found Hazelwood innocent of the most serious
charges against him, convicting him only of a misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil. He faces up to 90 days in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   He was acquitted of charges of second-degree criminal mischief,
reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only person charged
criminally in the environmental calamity. He was accused of being
drunk on duty and being away from the ship's bridge when it rammed
a charted reef.
   He came back to Alaska with some trepidation and kept a low
profile outside court. Many nights he stayed in his hotel room
watching old movies about sea captains rather than risk being
recognized in public.
   In court, the balding, bearded Hazelwood sat mute, watching in
stoic silence as his crew members told their stories.
   His demeanor was not unusual. Joe Hazelwood had always been a
man of few words.
   ``His actions always spoke louder than his words because his
words were not that many,'' said attorney Michael Chalos,
Hazelwood's former maritime college classmate who put together his
defense team just days after the Exxon Valdez grounding made
headlines.
   In school, says Chalos, the low key Hazelwood was ``a natural
leader ... very quiet but very determined.''
   He was captain of the lacrosse team and did well academically,
Chalos recalls, but was something of a rebel when it came to
military authority. His rebelliousness later would bring him into
conflict with Exxon executives over company policies.
   When he graduated from New York State University Maritime
College at Fort Schyler, Hazelwood signed on with Exxon Shipping
Corp.
   ``It was a plum appointment,'' recalls Chalos. ``If you got a
job with Exxon, you'd made it.''
   He rose in the seagoing ranks, obtained his master's license,
won the fleet award for efficiency in 1986 and, in 1987, was given
command of the brand new Exxon Valdez, the most advanced, high-tech
vessel in the Exxon fleet.
   He rarely spent more than three or four months at a time ashore.
But between voyages he returned to Huntington where he and his
wife, Suzanne, live with their teen-age daughter, Alison.
   ``I get stark crazy when I am too far from the salt water,'' he
has said.
   If there was a fatal flaw in Hazelwood's smooth history of
achievements, it was his drinking. He lost his New York motor
vehicle driver's license after two drunken driving convictions and
in 1985, with Exxon's knowledge, he went through a 28-day voluntary
alcohol rehabilitation program.
   Was he drunk aboard the Exxon Valdez on the fateful night? His
crew members testified they saw no signs of intoxication although
they had seen the captain put away a few drinks in town.
   His blood alcohol reading was .061 in a test taken 10{ hours
after the grounding. Evidence was inconclusive on what his blood
alcohol was earlier.
   Hazelwood, true to his taciturn nature, chose not to testify and
never commented on the intoxication issue.
   Why didn't he testify? Attorneys said they were confident about
their case and did not want to subject Hazelwood to unnecessary,
grueling cross-examination. They had another reason, too.
   ``Sitting here at the defense table, he's still the captain,
someone special,'' said Chalos. ``If he had gotten up on the
witness stand, he wouldn't be special anymore. He'd be just another
witness.''

   Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood
was acquitted today of three major charges and convicted of one
misdemeanor in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The single charge of which Hazelwood was convicted _ negligent
discharge of oil _ carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail
and a $1,000 fine, far less than the 7\ years and $61,000 fine he
could have faced.
   There were bursts of applause in the court room as Superior
Court Judge Karl Johnstone read the first three verdicts of ``not
guilty.''
   Hazelwood's lawyers patted him on the back, and for the first
time in the long trial, the normally solemn defendant smiled
broadly.
   The jurors, delivering their verdict two days before the first
anniversary of the disaster, absolved Hazelwood of all charges
alleging that he was drunk and reckless when the tanker ran
aground, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince
William Sound.
   The jurors reached their verdict after only 10{ hours of
deliberations.
   Earlier, the jury signaled they were close to a unanimous
decision by deciding to skip going out to lunch. They ordered food
sent into the jury room so they could continue their talks through
the lunch hour.
   But at noon, Johnstone emerged from his chambers and told
reporters the panel has reached its verdict.
   The panel, which ended its first day of deliberations Wednesday
without reaching a verdict, sought a series of blood alcohol charts
and graphs used by a defense expert to illustrate his testimony.
   Johnstone, after conferring in a hurried session with attorneys,
sent the jury a note saying: ``You have received all of the
evidence. The exhibits you have requested are not in evidence.''
   The jurors returned to their task today, checking in promptly at
8:30 a.m. A bailiff escorted them to their jury room and they began
their talks for a second day. The trial is in its seventh week.
   Meanwhile, an alternate juror who was dismissed once the regular
jury began its deliberations told the Alaska Public Radio Network
she would have acquitted Hazelwood of all charges.
   Terry Turner, an Anchorage bookkeeper, said she doubts the
skipper was drunk while in command.
   ``There were 21 witnesses who said there was no sign of
impairment,'' she said.
   She added that she believed Hazelwood had expected ``a normal
transit'' of Prince William Sound on the night of the March 24
grounding, which might explain his decision to leave the ship's
bridge.
   Asked whether she believed Hazelwood was drunk, she said: ``No,
I don't think he was. ... There was a lot more to it than that we
had a drunk captain running into a reef. They really didn't have
evidence of it.''
   Ms. Turner said she felt Hazelwood's loss of his job and the
impact on his life was sufficient punishment for whatever role he
had in the disaster.
   ``I don't think he was totally to blame,'' she said. ``I hope a
lot of the other jurors feel that way.''
   Saturday will be the first anniversary of the disaster, in which
the 987-foot tanker rammed the charted reef in Prince William
Sount, gushing nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil.
The spill wreaked devastation on birds, fish and wildlife, and
coated hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline.
   The exhibits sought by the jury Wednesday were used by defense
lawyers during the trial to help illustrate testimony by Michael
Hlastala, a physiologist who discussed blood testing for alcohol.
They showed the various absorption and burnoff rates of alcohol in
the human body.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson said the charts were not placed in
evidence because jurors might have been unable to decipher them
without the accompanying testimony.
   Hlastala of the University of Washington in Seattle had branded
as ``nonsense'' prosecution efforts to figure out Hazelwood's blood
alcohol level based on a blood test taken 10{ hours after the March
24 grounding.
   The prosecution sought to prove that the fired Exxon skipper was
drunk when his ship went aground at Bligh Reef while Hazelwood was
below.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony,
second-degree criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors: reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. He could receive 7\ years in prison and $61,000
in fines if convicted.
   The jury's note disclosed that they chose an insurance broker to
serve as forewoman in deliberations. The jury includes homemakers,
a real estate agent, an accountant, a postman and an air traffic
controller.
   Johnstone said he would allow the jurors to continue their talks
over the weekend if they should fail to reach verdicts by Friday.

<HEAD>Banking Committee OKs Money-Laundering Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee on Thursday
approved plans designed to crack down on banks that allow
themselves to be used in the money-laundering operations of drug
pushers.
   ``Money is the vehicle that drives the drug trade,'' Chairman
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said as the committee approved the bill
48-0.
   The measure would require federal regulators to hold a hearing
on whether to close any bank convicted with its directors and
officers of money laundering or related offenses. The charter could
be revoked or regulators could appoint a conservator to operate the
bank.
   Federal officials already have the power to close banks
convicted of money laundering. However, the hearings outlined in
the bill would set the machinery in motion, sponsors said.
   Lawmakers have expressed heightened concern about money
laundering, under which huge drug profits are hidden by
transferring them through Caribbean tax havens and other centers of
banking secrecy before they are returned to the United States and
invested in legitimate businesses.
   A similar bill was introduced in the Senate on Wednesday.
   ``Banks that knowingly handle dirty drug money should not be
permitted to do business in this country,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
   Gonzalez described the House plan as a compromise that would not
only punish those who ignore money laundering but also provide due
process for bankers.
   He hailed Reps. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., Thomas R. Carper,
R-Del., and Bill McCollum, R-Fla., for working out a compromise.
   Annunzio cited estimates that worldwide drug profits could total
$300 billion a year.
   ``The vast quantities of cash may provide drug dealers with
their greatest vulnerability to detection,'' he said. ``The drug
dealer is caught in a never-ending blizzard of cash every day.''
   The bill calls for removal of bank officials convicted of money
laundering or structuring transactions to evade requirements of the
Bank Secrecy Act. Those convicted would be prohibited from
affiliating with other financial institutions.
   The measure would require the Treasury Department to establish
regulations aimed at halting money laundering by wire transfer. It
would raise the fine for negligent non-compliance with
money-laundering reporting requirements from $500 to $5,000.

<HEAD>ANCHORAGE, Alaska: late Tuesday.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After a year of accusations against faceless villains _ Exxon
and oil-related agencies _ the Hazelwood trial provided a human
side to the Exxon Valdez calamity, focusing on frailties of captain
and crew.
   Although 150 civil suits were filed and Exxon was indicted in
federal court, Hazelwood was the only individual charged
criminally. His lawyers complained he was a ``scapegoat'' in a
disaster with many culprits.
   His trial in Anchorage Superior Court had the elements of an
engrossing sea story with a dark subplot involving liquor, troubled
crew members and a star-crossed captain whose battles with the
bottle were well known.
   But the skipper, who had been painted as a liquor swigging
brigand, turned out to be a quiet figure intent on nothing more
than blending into the woodwork. He sat back, stroking his beard,
while others addressed the trial's key questions: Was the skipper
drunk on duty and was he reckless to leave the ship's bridge?
   Whether Hazelwood was drunk when his ship grounded remained a
muddled issue because authorities failed to do a timely blood
alcohol test. When they got around to it 10{ hours after the
grounding, Hazelwood had a .061 alcohol reading, lower than the
Alaska standard of .10 for drunken driving.
   A prosecution expert witness tried to calculate backward and
concluded that Hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of .14 when
the ship grounded. But defense experts ridiculed the figures as
``nonsense,'' saying results could not be conclusive because there
was too long a wait before the test and too many variables,
including whether Hazelwood drank after the grounding.
   Hazelwood, who chose not to testify, never explained.
   In six weeks of testimony, witnesses came forward to tell what
they knew of the day the Exxon Valdez and Hazelwood sailed into
history.
   It was the Thursday before Good Friday, and the tanker had
pulled into its namesake port of Valdez to pick up a load of oil.
Hazelwood went ashore for lunch with two crew members and a local
pilot; they remember that he sipped iced tea. Then they separated
to do shopping.
   Later in the day _ the hour remained in dispute _ Hazelwood met
with his pals at the Pipeline Club, a bar where they said he drank
three vodkas in about three hours. A woman patron of the club, wife
of a Coast Guard investigator in the case, placed Hazelwood there
much earlier, drinking for seven hours. But her testimony never was
corroborated.
   On the way back to the ship, the men stopped and bought pizza
for the crew, and Hazelwood had another drink, either beer or vodka.
   When they arrived at the Valdez terminal about 8:20 p.m., they
learned that the sailing time, originally set for 10 p.m., had been
moved up to 9 p.m. The prosecution would maintain that Hazelwood's
tardiness in boarding his ship showed recklessness.
   Was the skipper intoxicated? He showed no signs of it. During
the trial not a single witness said he appeared drunk.
   ``Did he stagger?'' defense attorneys would ask. ``Did he slur
his words?'' Inevitably, the answers were, ``No.''
   Pilot William Murphy, who guided the tanker through the Valdez
Narrows, said he noticed a trace of alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
After a half-hour on the bridge, he said the skipper went below and
remained there for an hour. When Murphy left the ship at about
10:30 p.m., he conferred with Hazelwood: ``I reminded him there was
ice reported ahead.''
   The crucial period, recounted repeatedly in testimony, began at
11:53 p.m. when Hazelwood decided to leave the bridge in control of
third mate Gregory Cousins after discussing maneuvers that would
take the Exxon Valdez out of shipping lanes to avoid ice, then turn
back to the lanes before leaving Prince William Sound.
   ``He asked if I felt comfortable with what we were going to do
and I said, `Yes,' recalled Cousins. ``He said, `Do you feel
comfortable enough that I can go below and get rid of some
paperwork?' I said I felt very comfortable.''
   The prosecution would note that Cousins did not have the special
endorsement Hazelwood had for piloting in Prince William Sound, a
license the defense claimed was mere formality and had been waived
by the Coast Guard.
   At the helm was Robert Kagan, a seaman who had problems with
steering in the past. Many witnesses would blame Kagan for ramming
the oil-filled tanker into a charted reef.
   Cousins said he ordered Kagan to make a 10-degree right rudder
turn, a routine order. But he failed to check until it was too late
to see if the turn had been made. By then, the Exxon Valdez was
steaming toward Bligh Reef.
   Ten minutes after Hazelwood left the bridge, Cousins glanced at
the rudder indicator and, ``I could tell we hadn't turned. ... I
think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the command.''
   Cousins called Hazelwood in his cabin.
   ``I told him that we were getting into serious trouble ...,''
the third mate recalled. ``That was then we suffered the first
shock and we were hard aground.''
   Deep holes were gashed in the ship's underbelly. She was impaled
on a rock the size of a Volkswagen, and warm oil was bubbling into
the cold, clear waters of Prince William Sound. In all, the ship
belched out nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude
oil in a hemorrhage that killed countless birds, fish and wildlife
on the richly populated sound. The rocky shore turned black for
hundreds of miles.
   ``What's the problem?'' a Coast Guard investigator asked
Hazelwood upon boarding the crippled ship.
   ``I think you're looking at it,'' said the captain in a comment
which planted the idea that the skipper was accepting blame. His
lawyers would say that was his training talking _ a captain always
takes responsibility for his ship.
   One issue which consumed half the trial was whether Hazelwood,
in the frantic moments after grounding, tried to drive his ship off
the reef. He denied it, but prosecutors tried to show he risked
capsizing the tanker and killing the crew.
   The issue became moot when the defense proved the ship was
immovable, and the judge agreed Hazelwood could not be convicted of
trying something that was impossible.

<HEAD>Trading MX for SS-24 A Piossibility</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Pentagon official on Thursday refused
to rule out giving up the rail-garrison MX nuclear missile if the
Soviets give up their SS-24 missile as part of the negotiations to
reduce strategic weapons.
   ``This is obviously a serious proposal advanced by serious
people and needs to be given serious consideration,'' Stephen
Hadley, assistant secretary of defense for international security
policy, told a House Armed Services subcommittee on defense policy.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of both the subcommittee and
the parent committee, criticized the Bush administration's current
proposal in U.S.-Soviet strategic arms talks, the START talks, that
would keep the B-2 stealth bomber and two land-based nuclear
missiles.
   Aspin and subcommittee members of both parties warned that the
chances were slim of Congress approving all 132 B-2 bombers the Air
Force wants as well as future funds for two missiles _ the
single-warhead Midgetman on the drawing boards and the rail-mobile,
multiple-warhead MX missile now deployed in underground silos.
   ``We're not going to buy 132 (bombers) and I maintain it's not a
responsible position for the U.S. government to pursue arms control
based on buying 132,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio.
   ``I can't tell you how many we're going to buy; I can't tell you
the plane's going to work.''
   Aspin asked Hadley and Lt. Gen. G.L. Butler, director of
strategic plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for their
opinions of a scenario in which the Untied States had 15 B-2
bombers and no Midgetman or rail-garrison MX missiles.
   ``I don't want to leave the impression here that we walk away
from START,'' Hadley replied. ``If there are some things that
disrupt that linkage then we have to go to the bottom line, take a
look and see if there are some adjustments.''
   Aspin replied: ``Save some time and make the adjustments now
Steve, ... trade on the missile,'' to get rid of the Soviet SS-24.
   Earlier, Aspin had suggested trading the Soviet's SS-24 missile
for current U.S. plans to move the MX missile to railroad cars, and
pressed Hadley for a response.
   ``There are a lot of proposals and ideas that are being
considered. A lot of them around town. This is obviously one of
them that's being offered and will be considered seriously,''
Hadley said.
   Aspin later pressed the officials about possible revisions in
the nearly 10,000 Soviet targets the United States would likely
attack in the event of nuclear war.
   Citing unclassified information, Aspin said the sites are 2,000
nuclear targets, 1,600 conventional weapons targets, 4,400 economic
targets and 750 aimed at the Soviet leadership. The chairman
stressed that with the reduced threat from the Soviet Union, the
target number should be changed.
   Hadley said the targets are reviewed regularly.
   But Aspin said the number remains constant and ``is being used
up here to argue for the B-2.''

   Randy Simmons is a quadriplegic because he
tried what he thought was a safe, non-prescription food supplement
to deal with pain and sleeplessness, his lawyers say.
   The food supplement was L-tryptophan. The 41-year-old owner of a
small accounting company is one of more than 1,400 people
nationwide who contracted a rare blood disorder,
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome or EMS, after taking the product once
touted in vitamin catalogs as ``nature's tranquilizer.''
   Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control have
recorded 19 deaths.
   Simmons and dozens of others have sued retailers, suppliers and
manufacturers of the amino acid, which has been on the market for
years. Cases of EMS started showing up last summer, but experts say
the problem previously may have been misdiagnosed.
   CDC has reports of 1,411 cases in all 50 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico. California has the most cases with 239.
New York has reported 140. Twelve states have more than 30 cases.
They are: Texas, 72; Ohio, 72; Florida, 71; Minnesota, 63; Oregon,
61; South Carolina, 53; Pennsylvania, 52; Arizona, 46; Washington,
43; Colorado, 38; Illinois, 38; and New Mexico, 33.
   L-tryptophan was recalled by the Food and Drug Administration in
November. On Thursday, Louis Sullivan, Health and Human Services
secretary, issued a strong warning against continued use, calling
the EMS outbreak a ``major public health problem'' and warning that
even small doses of L-tryptophan could be harmful.
   Simmons is surviving thanks to a machine that breathes for him
and a feeding tube that runs into his stomach. He has limited use
of his right arm and hand, but his mental faculties are sharp and
he still has feeling in his body and limbs. His prognosis is
uncertain.
   ``We've talked to quite a few of the lawyers handling these
cases nationwide and we haven't heard of another case as serious''
in an EMS survivor, said Arden Bradshaw, Simmons' attorney.
   Bradshaw has filed suit in Sedgwick County District Court
seeking unspecified damages from six businesses _ retail stores and
their suppliers for brands of L-triptophan that Simmons took over
the years.
   Four to six Japanese manufacturers made the food supplement.
Some investigators believe most of the people who have been
stricken with EMS took L-tryptophan that can be traced to one
manufacturer. The CDC has not pinpointed the source of the problem.
   One lawyer handling L-triptophan cases, Gayle Troutwine of
Portland, Ore., argues that Showa Denko Co. of Japan is responsible
for the outbreak because its product became contaminated. A suit
filed by Troutwine last month on behalf of Helen Jones, 52, of
Portland also claims Showa Denko has refused to cooperate with U.S.
officials investigating the supplement.
   At the time the lawsuit was filed, Shotaro Kawakatsu, a
spokesman in Japan for Showa Denko, noted that the FDA was
investigating the illness and said the company was awaiting the
results of the study. Kawakatsu said his company had exported
L-trytophan to the United States but declined to say how much.
   Showa Denko is not named as a defendant in Simmons' suit.
Bradshaw said he is still doing research to determine what company
or companies manufactured the products his client took.
   L-tryptophan was touted as an aid for problems including high
cholesterol, high blood pressure, tooth pain and depression.
   Simmons began taking it about 2{ years ago because he was having
trouble sleeping, in part because of recurring pain from injuries
suffered in a 1983 auto accident. Simmons found he was able to
sleep better, but last September, he realized something was very
wrong. He was losing weight _ eventually, more than 80 pounds _ and
experiencing severe muscle pain.
   Doctors looked for cancer, parasites and other diseases before
finally diagnosing EMS, which is characterized by an abnormally
high white blood cell count.
   On Nov. 6, Simmons went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.,
for treatments that included chemotheraphy and a blood cleansing
process. He's now back in a Wichita hospital; it hasn't been
determined whether the effort stopped his decline.
   Linda Simmons, his 35-year-old wife, said her husband has been
too ill to become angry about his situation. But she has fought
depression and other problems as she struggled to take care her
husband of seven years, their son, 3, and their daughter, 1.
   ``I've had a good deal of anger about it,'' she said. ``But
there are no boundaries or definitions for what's going on. What
should I be angry at?''

   Singer Gloria Estefan, whose back was broken
when her tour bus was hit by a truck, underwent successful surgery
Thursday to have her spine stabilized with metal rods, a doctor
said.
   Dr. Michael Neuwirth, an orthopedic surgeon, said he implanted
two steel rods onto Estefan's fractured vertebrae during a
four-hour operation. He expects her to make a full recovery in
three to six months and to be released from hospital in a week to
10 days.
   ``She'll be able to do everything, including dance,'' Neuwirth
told reporters at Manhattan's Institute Hospital for Joint Diseases.
   ``We were able to accomplish all our initial goals of surgery,
which was to restore the normal line of the spine and remove the
pressure that existed against the spinal cord.''
   Estefan, 32, of the Latin-pop band Miami Sound Machine was flown
to New York by helicopter Wednesday from a hospital in Scranton, Pa.
   Also recuperating from serious injuries in the crash was her
personal assistant, Jelissa Arencibia, who was being treated in
Pennsylvania. In an interview, Ms. Arencibia recalled the moments
after Tuesday's crash in the Pocono Mountains.
   ``I heard her voice screaming out for mine, but there was
nothing I could do,'' the assistant said.
   Known for her energetic dancing on stage, Estefan felt numbness
and weakness in her legs after the crash. Doctors said that,
besides being fractured, the two vertebrae were slightly dislocated.
   During the surgery, monitors recorded ``substantial improvement
in the electrical conduction of the nerves to her left leg,''
Neuwirth said. The singer will need to undergo therapy and wear a
plastic brace when she leaves the hospital, he said.
   Her husband, Emilio Estefan Jr., thanked the doctors and fans
for their concern and support.
   ``I don't care if she never danced again,'' he said. ``I'm just
happy she's alive.''
   He suffered minor injuries in the accident and appeared at the
hospital news conference with a bandaged right hand. Their
9-year-old son, Nayab, broke his collarbone.
   The Cuban-born singer and her group were headed to Syracuse for
a concert when their tour bus was struck from behind by a
tractor-trailer on a highway near Tobyhanna, Pa., authorities said.
Estefan was thrown from a couch where she was sleeping.
   Pennsylvania state police said Thursday that an inspection of
the truck showed it had faulty brakes. The trucker was cited for
driving at an unsafe speed and will face additional charges, police
said.
   Fans sent dozens of floral bouquets and arrangements, which
Estefan asked to be distributed to other patients.
   Well-wishers included President Bush, who met the Estefans on
Monday to talk their anti-drug work, and singers Elton John,
Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.
   The Miami Sound Machine has attracted listeners worldwide with
salsa, samba and conga for more than a decade. Its hits include
``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,'' and ``Anything for You.''
   Estefan was nominated for a Grammy in February for ``Don't Wanna
Lose You,'' a cut from her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways.''
   Ms. Arencibia said from a hospital bed at Community Medical
Center in Scranton that the accident ``happened so quick.''
   ``I couldn't move. I was already paralyzed from my neck to my
back and I heard Gloria screaming. I heard her voice screaming out
for mine, but there was nothing we could do,'' she said, her voice
cracking.
   She said they both struggled to help each other, but their hands
wouldn't reach and their legs couldn't move. After a while, she
said, they began to pray.
   Ms. Arencibia, 25, is listed as stable with broken ribs, neck
and back injuries, but is not paralyzed.
   Shortly before the accident, the band was discussing the meeting
with Bush. ``We were talking about the fact the day was so
wonderful and how exciting it was to meet the president, and then
Gloria and I decided to get a little nap,'' she said.
   About 40 minutes later, the women were hurled from their bus
beds. Band members covered them with blankets because the windows
of the bus were smashed and the temperature was near freezing.
   ``I've been wanting to talk to her,'' Ms. Arencibia said. ``I'm
having a lot of trouble sleeping. I still hear her voice, her
little voice inside my mind.''

<HEAD>Eastern, ALPA Agree to Interim Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its pilots union have agreed
to an interim contract that calls for a 25 percent wage cut, but
does not call for rehiring pilots who went on strike, the company
said Thursday.
   And the carrier insisted it needs twice that amount in
concessions by the time the contract expires on July 1 to emerge
successfully from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   The wage cut applies to Eastern pilots still being paid at the
pre-strike wage rate. Eastern had 3,600 union pilots who honored
picket lines when a sympathy strike with Machinists began in March
1989. Since then, many pilots have returned, replacements have been
hired at lower wages and the airline has sold many routes.
   Time to resolve the dispute ``regrettably has just about run
out, in light of the reorganization timetable,'' said Thomas J.
Matthews, senior vice president of human resources for the carrier,
which is owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Edward Breen
charged that the company intends to use the temporary agreement,
which was negotiated with the help of the National Mediation Board,
as a device to crush the union.
   He said by demanding more concessions in advance, Eastern hoped
to push the talks into a final impasse.
   ``Their first preference would be to have the NMB put us in a
cooling-off period,'' Breen said Thursday. ``After that, they can
impose their own conditions.''
   Breen said ALPA executives had agreed in principle to the
contract, but it will not be signed until after a formal vote of
the Master Executive Committee on Saturday in Washington. He said
the union leaders reluctantly went along with the interim contract
to show they were bargaining in good faith and to persuade the
mediation board to pressure Eastern to do the same.
   The wage cuts applies to about 850 Eastern pilots still working
at the pre-strike average of $72,000 a year. A 25 percent cut would
bring that average down to $54,000. But it excludes about 950
replacement pilots hired at an average $27,500 when the strike
began.
   The new wage levels are among the lowest in the country for
major carriers, Breen said.
   ``An Eastern pilot after this will make about 50 percent of what
a United Airlines pilot makes _ and they still can't make a
profit,'' he said.
   There was no agreement on the key sticking point of hiring back
more of the pilots who went on strike.
   ``The agreement does not cover that _ it covers only wages and
benefits,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. ``And the simple
fact is that no jobs are available now.''
   The intertim agreement calls for a reduction in the airline's
contribution to the pilots' pension plan, increased pilot
contributions to their medical and dental insurance, and the
preservation of tougher work rules in effect since the strike.
   Eastern insisted federal mediators would have to continue
efforts to reach a permanent agreement to cut costs further.
   ``If expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an
arrangement, Eastern ... will have to promptly seek bankruptcy
court permission to achieve full cost reductions on a long-term
basis,'' Eastern said in its statement.
   Eastern's ALPA contract expired in June 1988, but its provisions
had remained in effect under the Railway Labor Act.
   Eastern lost $282.6 million in the last quarter of 1989,
bringing total losses for the year to $852.3 million, or almost all
of Houston-based Texas Air's $885.6 million loss.

   A pair of prominent physists who said the
super collider would let scientists learn more about the Big Bang
failed Thursday to win over some House Republicans who can't get
past the project's Big Price.
   ``I find a number of Americans regard the (super collider) as a
super-expensive super hole, money pit of the '90s,'' said Rep.
Silvio Conte, R-Mass.
   The $8 billion super collider is a 54-mile underground tunnel,
to be built south of Dallas, in which streams of protons, guided by
powerful electromagents, would be hurled into each other at almost
the speed of light, breaking up into exotic smaller particles in
the collisions.
   Tsung-Dao Lee, professor of physics at Columbia University,
testified the high collision energy of the super collider _ 20
times what is available today _ would ``recreate the physical state
that existed in our universe'' about one millionth of a billionth
of a second after the Big Bang, in which scientists believe the
universe was created some 20 billion years ago.
   ``Our aim is to understand that set of laws which governs
everything,'' Lee said. The super collider ``makes a direct route
toward achieving this understanding. It will be our contribution to
the civilization of the next century.''
   ``What I don't understand is why the physics community considers
the (super collider) such an urgent project,'' Conte said. ``Have
physicists run out of things to do?''
   Conte also questioned whether the super collider would be
obsolete before it's operational in 1998. Sidney D. Drell, deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, said he did not
think so.
   ``There's no way we can miss getting fundamental information,''
Drell said.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on energy and water development, called the scientists
to Capitol Hill to explain the importance of building the super
collider as he seeks congressional approval of second-year
construction funds for the project.
   Originally said to cost $4.4 billion, the Energy Department
later increased the price to $5.9 billion and now says design
changes and higher labor costs are pushing the total closer to $8
billion. Congress agreed to spend $225 million on the project in
the current fiscal year and the Bush administration is seeking $318
million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Rep. John Myers, R-Ind., ranking Republican on the
Appropriations energy subcommittee, complained about the latest
cost increase and said the collider, if it survives, ``can't
survive another one. I think it could be jeopardized now.''
   Opponents of the super collider have suggested the United States
join a European consortium building another accelerator but Drell
said that $1 billion collider would have one-third the science,
one-third the energy, and would go one-third of ``the way we want
to go'' with the super collider.

   The Bush administration asked a federal
appeals court Thursday to dispel a legal cloud that could delay the
president's savings and loan bailout and cost taxpayers millions of
dollars.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision is
appealing an order from U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth
blocking the takeover of a suburban Chicago savings institution
with $1.1 billion in assets.
   Lamberth sided with Olympic Savings and Loan Association,
Berwyn, Ill., in ruling Wednesday that acting thrift office
director Salvatore R. Martoche and his predecessor, M. Danny Wall,
were unconstitutionally appointed.
   Government attorneys said Lamberth's preliminary injunction
could unleash a flood of similar challenges. They asked the U.S.
Court of Appeals to stay the order and then consider their appeal
on an expedited basis.
   ``Institutions that are rapidly losing money and fear that they
might be placed into receivership are likely to follow Olympic's
lead ... thereby ... adding millions of dollars to the already
costly thrift crisis,'' the administration said in a memo to the
appellate court.
   ``On a more sinister level, management that may be looting some
thrifts may sue to block anticipated enforcement action,'' it
continued. ``In short ... the district court's ruling places a
cloud over the agency's authority to conduct its operations, a
cloud that will likely have a profound impact on the (thrift
office's) ability to deal effectively with the continuing thrift
crisis.''
   About 600 of 2,600 S&amp;Ls nationally fall short of capital
requirements and may eventually be seized.
   Late Wednesday, within hours of Lamberth's ruling, the parent
company of Imperial Savings Association, a $10 billion thrift in
California, asked the U.S. District Court in San Diego to overturn
its Feb. 23 seizure.
   Franklin Savings Association, a large S&amp;L in Ottawa, Kan., filed
a similar suit last week in federal court in Topeka.
   Olympic contended, and Lamberth agreed, that Wall was improperly
appointed when Congress dismantled his old agency, the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, and transferred many of its duties to the new
thrift office.
   The S&amp;L law automatically gave Wall the thrift office job.
Lamberth said Wall should have been nominated by President Bush and
confirmed by the Senate, as required by the Constitution.
   Bush appointed Martoche on an acting basis after Wall resigned
March 5. Martoche had been confirmed by the Senate as an assistant
secretary of the treasury and normally could temporarily fill in as
thrift office director. In this case, however, Lamberth said
Martoche cannot do that because he succeeded someone who had not
legally held the job.
   The thrift office regulates solvent S&amp;Ls, turning them over to
the Resolution Trust Corp. when they fail. The RTC, created in
August by the bailout law, has taken control of 402 S&amp;Ls so far,
disposing of 52 of them.
   RTC Chairman L. William Seidman said his agency's attorneys were
studying the matter but said the two situations were different
because the RTC is, in effect, a subordinate agency to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He said RTC attorneys were also looking into whether the agency
can proceed with sales of S&amp;Ls already in government control, but
he conceded that buyers may be wary, even if the RTC concludes it
can.

   House leaders reported being close to reaching
a bipartisan agreement Thursday on a bill to help families with
child care, including care provided at church-sponsored centers.
   Closed-door negotiations between Democrats, Republicans and the
White House cleared away most differences on the legislation,
prompting both sides to hold out hope an agreement could be reached
by next week.
   ``We are very close,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., one of
the sponsors of a Democratic version.
   ``We've been hearing for some time we're just inches away _ just
a smidgen away from agreement,'' said the House Republican leader
Bob Michel, who was not participating in the direct negotionations.
   Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., sponsor of a conservative alternative,
called the progress toward an agreement between the administration,
House Republicans and House Democrats ``nothing short of
incredible.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley said the negotiations, if successful,
would produce ``a landmark bill.'' He said House debate was
scheduled for next Wednesday and predicted passage before the end
of March.
   Competing versions of the legislation would expand tax credits
to families for child-care expenses, provide vouchers for use by
parents to subsidize care, and provide more aid for Head Start and
other programs.
   Democratic leaders have yet to produce their version in writing.
But in negotiations, they agreed to provisions permitting federal
support go to church-sponsored day care centers, including those
where sectarian instruction was offered.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Democratic leaders also agreed to provisions sought by
Republicans and conservative Democrats to require states adopt a
program issuing vouchers to low-income families for child-care
subsidies.
   In return, they were seeking Republican acceptance of a new
program of before- and after-school child care based in schools.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu met again Thursday with
House Democrats and Republicans in negotiating on the bill. Cost of
the legislation was estimated at around $20 billion over a five
years.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Approves Ragsdale Abortion Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday
that keeps the state from restricting abortions to women less than
18 weeks pregnant.
   U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement
between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair,
reasonable and adequate,'' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion.
   Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it
``unconscionable and unconstitutional.''
   Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the
U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of
several that anti-abortion groups had hoped would be used as a test
case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   The settlement permits the state to regulate abortion clinics
without removing the availability of abortions to women who are
less than 18 weeks pregnant.
   Under the agreement, access to abortions cannot be restricted by
substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the
number of clinics.
   The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale,
who objected to regulations requiring abortion clinics to be
equipped and staffed like small hospitals.
   He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access
to abortions.
   One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated
that patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption
and that counselors be people who wouldn't profit from abortions.
   The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all abortion
clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a
``certificate of need'' from the state verifying that they do not
duplicate similar services in their areas.

<HEAD>Swedish Army on Alert After Soviet Troop Movements in Lithuania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sweden has put its military on a higher
state of alert after reports of Soviet troop movements in the
republic of Lithuania, defense officials said Thursday.
   ``There have been changes in the frame of our basic alert,''
which marginally increase the state of preparedness, said defense
spokeswoman Kari Hansson.
   Among other measures, she said more pilots than usual were on
call.
   Lithuanians complained of increased Soviet military activity
after the republic declared itself independent from Moscow on March
11. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday ordered Lithuanians
to turn in their firearms within seven days and Soviet armor rolled
through Vilnius streets on Thursday.
   Civilian authorities on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea
said they were preparing for a possible influx of Lithuanian
refugees escaping by boat in case the situation deteriorates.
   Gotland, a summer holiday island for many Swedes, is 100 miles
northwest of the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda.
   ``There is an unusual military activity in the Baltics right
now,'' Maj. Gen. Bertel Osterdahl told national news agency TT.
   He said the Swedish defense was closely following the changes of
deployments, including a paratroop unit in the Lithuanian city of
Kaunas.
   ``There are already a total of 50,000 Soviet soldiers in the
Baltics, '' he said. ``In Lithuania there is about 10,000 members
of the national militia.'' Reports from Lithuania put the number of
Soviet troops at 30,000.
   Osterdahl said the Soviet troop movements seemed to be a show of
force, but added, ``The Baltics are so important for the Soviet
Union that it would never give up its bases there.''

<HEAD>Neighbors Fearful After Ax Murder in Seattle Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People are buying guns, security systems and
forming community watches in the neighborhood where an intruder
hacked to death a woman in her home.
   Fear set in after the body of Geneva McDonald was found in her
upstairs bedroom in the home she had lived in for 20 years. She was
bludgeoned, and police said they believe the weapon was an ax.
   Officials know of three other incidents in days before her death
in which a prowler or prowlers used axes or mauls to try to break
into homes in the upscale Queen Anne Hill neighborhood, just north
of downtown Seattle.
   ``I would love to move out of the city, the state, the country
right about now, but I can't,'' said Lisa Hawes, 33, who lives with
her husband and 2-year-old son four houses away.
   ``It's been a rough week up here. It's the buzz at all the stops
you go _ the grocery store, the cleaners,'' she added. ``Right now
this is not a fun place to be living.''
   McDonald's two-story yellow house is roped off with police tape.
Authorities believe the 63-year-old secretary for a shipbuilding
company was killed as she slept during the night of March 11-12.
   Ten detectives are investigating and 10 officers cruise the
neighborhood that had been patrolled by two officers, said Maj. Joe
Tolliver, commander of the police department's criminal
investigation division.
   Burglary is the only suspected motive but police haven't
determined that anything was taken even though the house was
ransacked.
   They're comparing fingerprints found at the house with those in
a crime computer, checking the whereabouts of recently released
convicts and trying to develop a profile of the killer.
   Police informed a crowded neighborhood meeting Tuesday evening
about the progress of the investigation but did not yet have a
suspect, Hawes said following the meeting.
   Tolliver said he couldn't recall another Seattle homicide
involving an ax.
   But between March 1 and 3, someone used a wood-splitting maul in
an attempt to break into a nearby condominium, smashing the knob on
a storage room door.
   On March 4, a man living in a nearby home heard his basement
door window being broken. He turned on a floodlight and frightened
away the prowler, who left behind an ax. Hawes said the homeowner
and his wife, both in their 80s, were so frightened they began
staying with a relative.
   On March 9, a man in another nearby home awoke to discover his
back door open and found an ax that had been on his back porch in
his living room. Nothing was taken and police found no fingerprints.
   Right after McDonald's death, there was panic, neighborhood
residents said. Then there was hope the killer knew his victim,
which at least would mean there was no random psychopath
terrorizing the neighborhood.
   There was no sign of forced entry. Police don't know whether
McDonald, divorced and living alone, normally left doors and
windows unlocked or hid a key outdoors.
   She had been the captain of a small block watch program among
neighbors who shared the same alley, Hawes said.
   Some residents have bought guns, said a widow in her 60s who
spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal. Others
have installed security systems. Many are organizing new block
watch programs, with the help of police.
   ``Now there's no place to go _ no place to move in Seattle,''
the woman said. ``That creep will strike someplace else. ... He
will do it again.''
   Kirk Robbins, chairman of the Queen Anne Community Council, said
he had not heard of particular person buying guns since the slaying
but added that it wouldn't surprise him.
   Neighbors now say they have cleared their yards of dangerous
tools. Exterior lights remain on all night. Families no longer
leave keys hidden outdoors.
   ``We used to be able to leave doors open,'' Hawes said. ``Now
you feel isolated, like your house is a fortress or something.''
   McDonald had planned to retire soon, her neighbor said.
   ``She was the nicest, nicest woman,'' said Hawes. ``She was a
great gardener, always throwing out botanical names and losing me.
   ``I try to remember Jenny walking down the street, not lying in
bed butchered.''

<HEAD>Plea Scrawled at Scene of Family Slaying: `God Please Forgive Me'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old girl who squeezed through a dog
door at her friend's house found the message scrawled in black
crayon on the dining room wall: ``God please forgive me.''
   Elsewhere, she found the bodies of an out-of-work single mother
and her three children, all shot to death in what police described
as an act of desperation by a woman overwhelmed by her marital and
financial difficulties.
   The family dog also had been shot and killed.
   ``We're about 99 percent complete with the initial investigation
and we're pretty sure what happened there was a murder-suicide,''
Detective Rick Swanston said Thursday. ``There isn't anything
pointing in any other direction.''
   Crystal Erickson discovered the bodies in suburban Reseda after
school Wednesday afternoon.
   She also found a five-page suicide note by Roxanne Fernandez
Jones, 32, who said she loved her children and hated to put them
through living in a world full of strife, the Daily News reported.
   Investigators found Brandy Fernandez, 16, and her sister
Leticia, 13, in their beds, each shot in the head and chest,
Swanston said. Jeremiah Jones, 7, was shot to death in his mother's
bed, and her body was found nearby with a small-caliber rifle.
   For police, the remaining task involves examining evidence and
tying up a few administrative loose ends, Swanston said.
   But for Jones' relatives, friends and neighbors, there remain
questions that may never be answered.
   ``People suffer behind closed doors,'' said Gloria Allred, an
attorney involved in women's rights issues.
   ``It's a common problem with single parents after separation and
before legal proceedings to be in a financial and emotional
crisis.''
   Jones had been receiving support from her first husband, Joaquin
Fernandez, and she was recently separated from Jeremiah's father,
police said.
   ``If there was an informal arrangement for him to pay some of
the bills, I don't know,'' Swanston said.
   Studies by Harvard sociologist Lenore Weitzman have shown that
single mothers tend to suffer the most in the first year after
divorce, experiencing a 73 percent decline in their standard of
living. By contrast, men typically experience a 42 percent
improvement in living standards.
   Jones recently had stopped working for the Salvation Army and
apparently had been unable to find steady work, friends and
neighbors said. She had been baby-sitting and picking up odd jobs
for extra money, and recently asked neighbors for small amounts of
money.
   Brandy, her eldest, had contributed her pay from a pizzeria to
help feed the family before she was laid off from her job a week
ago, said her boyfriend, Derek Shelton, 18.
   ``Everything just wasn't going well for her,'' Lance Johnson, a
neighbor and friend, told the Los Angeles Times.
   ``I can't believe she did this,'' said Joyce Pacheco, who lives
around the corner. ``Roxanne never seemed depressed about
anything.''

   High homicide rates, AIDS and lack of medical
care are continuing to cut short the lives of black Americans,
while the health of whites is improving, a government report said
Thursday.
   While whites can expect to live to the age of 75.5, life
expectancy for blacks is 69.5, and for black males it is 65.1,
according to the study.
   Healthier living _ quitting smoking, using seat belts, reducing
violence and eating more nutritiously _ is the key to improving
health, since more than half the causes of premature death are
related to lifestyle, said Health and Human Sercies Secretary Louis
Sullivan.

   A drug that eases the heart's workload can
cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in
people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study
released Thursday.
   The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil,
known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years
after a heart attack. Calcium blockers are among several classes of
medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.

   The government expanded its recall of
L-tryptophan Thursday because of fears that a sometimes fatal blood
disorder can be caused even by small doses of the dietary
supplement used for insomnia, depression and weight control.
   L-tryptophan is an amino acid that occurs naturally in some
foods that are high in protein, such as milk, beef, turkey and
beans. But it is also sold over the counter as a manufactured
dietary supplement. It has been linked to a blood disorder called
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS.

   Lowering the amount of fat in one's diet even by
a little can go a long way toward reducing risk of developing new
clogs in the arteries of the heart, say researchers who studied 82
middle-aged men.
   ``These were all free-living citizens who selected their own
diet,'' said Dr. David H. Blankenhorn, director of the
Atheroslerosis Research Institute at the University of Southern
California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
   The two-year study examined 82 middle-aged men who had undergone
heart bypass surgery and were counseled to reduce their total fat
consumption to 26 percent of total calories, including saturated
fats, polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats. In the typical
American diet, fat accounts for 40 percent of total calories
consumed.
   The results of the study were reported in Friday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.

   Alcohol is responsible for more than 100,000
deaths annually in the United States, stealing 2.7 million years
from drinkers' lives, federal health officials reported Thursday.
   But while alcohol is a major health concern, more research is
needed to determine which drinkers are at how much risk, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control said.
   In 1987, the latest year for which projections are available,
105,095 Americans died from alcohol-related causes _ either drunken
injury or diseases linked to drinking, the CDC said. And when the
victims' life expectancy was figured in, alcohol robbed them of
more than 2.7 million years of life _ or about 26 years each.

   A fire that threatened to destroy the world's

habitat, officials said Thursday.
   ``We were probably days away from the extinction of a species,''

   The National Zoo has been coordinating a project to breed the
highly endangered golden lion tamarins and return them to the Poco

   Fire broke out about Feb. 2 at Poco das Antas, which is home to
about 400 tamarins. They make up about 80 percent of the remaining

   A toxin similar to red tide could have caused
the mysterious deaths of as many as 680 endangered sea turtles off
Colombia, officials said.
   Only a few thousand adult Pacific green turtles are known to
exist, so the beaching represents the loss of a substantial part of
the population, said Jack Woody, national sea turtle coordinator
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque, N.M.
   Colombian fishermen attributed the deaths to a curse put on them
for over exploiting the sea's resources, said Roderic Mast,
director of species conservation at Conservation International in
Washington. The turtles eat plant material, and some could have
contained toxins, Mast said.

part of Romania.
   ``Nobody is going to take Transylvania away from us. Don't let
yourselves be fooled by rumors,'' he told the crowd of about 3,000
as troops and tanks made a show of force on the Square of Roses,
focal point of Tuesday night's carnage, when most of the casualties
occurred.
   Earlier Thursday, about 3,000 Romanians and 1,000 ethnic
Hungarians gathered at opposite ends of the square to shout
slogans, separated by soldiers.
   Voican was in Tirgu Mures, a city of 165,000 northwest of
Bucharest, to lead the central government's efforts to defuse the
worst crisis since the December revolution.
   Long suppressed under former Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, the ethnic Hungarians have demanded greater autonomy and
wrung some concessions from the current provisional government of
President Ion Iliescu, including reopening Hungarian-language
schools closed by Ceausescu.
   Many Romanians resent the concessions as favoritism. They
believe that nationalistic ethnic Hungarians, supported by the
Hungarian government, are trying to engineer the transfer of
Transylvania to Hungary.
   Voican's committee of inquiry met with Hungarian and Romanian
community leaders and then put together a communique, which Voican
outlined in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``The Hungarian side agreed that there could be no talk of
secession,'' Voican said, adding that the communique contains a
guarantee by the Romanian side to the Hungarians.
   He did not specify the nature of the guarantee.
   The communique called for an end to the work stoppages that hit
nearly all major factories in the area on Thursday.
   It also provided for formation of a mixed commission to
investigate all intercommunal complaints and settle them.
   But Voican said ``the final and definitive guarantees to both
sides cannot be given until after the coming elections. Both sides
have accepted that.''
   Romania's first free elections since 1937 are set for May 20,
and will establish a parliamentary system of government.
   Until then, the country will continue to be led by the Council
of National Unity, an amalgam of the National Salvation Front that
took power during the revolution and dozens of opposition parties
that have sprung up or revived since then.
   Voican told the Romanians in the square, ``The representatives
of the Hungarian people have gone on record that they don't want to
secede from Romania.''
   ``Liars, liars!'' the crowd roared back.
   He appealed for calm, and told the crowd, ``Conflicts can only
be solved through dialogue.''
   But emotions still ran high.
   In nearby Ungheni, former political detainee Ioan Hodos, a
Romanian, told The AP, ``In this part of Romania, racial
discrimination is just like in South Africa.''
   History teacher Dumitru Botos, also a Romanian, said, ``People
in the south of the country perceive things differently than we do
here. They do not see the dangers posed by the Hungarians, who in
fact want privileges.''
   Mountainous Transylvania has about 2 million ethnic Hungarians
and about 5 million Romanians.
   In Budapest, the capital of Hungary, the Hungarian government
and political parties issued statements condemning the bloodshed in
Tirgu Mures.
   The government statement accused the Romanian government of
hesitating ``to take resolute action to put down the revival of
chauvinism in Romania.''
   It asked the Bucharest leadership to condemn the violence and
protect ethnic Hungarians.
   Hungary ruled Translylvania for centuries before 1920 when the
region was ceded to Romania by the victorous Allied powers in
return for its siding with the Allies in World War I.
   On Thursday, the army appeared to be the only factor keeping the
two sides apart in ths city, despite the presence of the commission
of inquiry.
   ``The army is here to keep the peace. ... Without this no man's
land, they would tear each other apart,'' said a captain of the
parachute regiment that flew in Wednesday. He spoke on condition
that he remain anonymous.
   The army has cordoned off the city, searching cars and checking
identification papers of anyone entering.

<HEAD>Commerce Department Issues Ban on Capture of Bottlenose Dolphins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government has ordered a temporary
halt to the capture of bottlenose dophins in the Gulf of Mexico as
scientists attempt to determine the cause of an unusually high
string of stranding deaths since early January.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced
the ban on dolphin collections late Wednesday and said it would
remain in effect through at least June 15.
   William W. Fox Jr., NOAA's assistant administrator for
fisheries, said the National Marine Fisheries Service ``will not
hesitate to obtain agreement for an extension of the non-capture
period or to protect further the dolphins as the situation
demands.''
   According to NOAA, more than 190 dolphins have been stranded and
died since Jan. 1 in five Gulf States _ 118 in Texas, more than 40
to 45 on the barrier islands of Louisiana and Mississippi, 21 in
the Alabama-Florida panhandle, and 10 in Florida's Tampa Bay.
   The dolphins have been stranded at four to five times the usual
rate for the time of year and the die-off continues, a NOAA
spokesman said.
   Although cold weather is believed responsible for the deaths of
26 dolphins in Texas' Matagorda Bay, the NOAA spokesman said ``this
thing could involve a number of reasons.''
   Until the past week or so, adult dolphins have been the victims,
but scientists are now watching to assess how the calving season
will be affected.
   During the calving season, which began during the second week of
March and goes into April, some pups and females die.
   ``We're going to try to keep as close track on it as possible. A
number of tissue samples are in laboratories for analysis and we
don't know how long it will take to analyze them or whether we'll
be able to draw any sort of conclusions,'' the spokesman said.
   Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the bottlenose dolphins
are considered a protected _ but not endangered or threatened _
species.
   According to NOAA, 11 organizations hold permits to collect live
dolphins, but only three do the actual collecting. The dolphins can
be taken for educational purposes such as aquariums or marine-type
theaters.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service contacted dolphin
collectors for the 11 permit holders and they volunteered to
suspend collections during the time period, Fox said.
   The quota on live dolphin collections was 91 last year and was
to be 91 this year, although the government had considered reducing
it to 35.
   ``Everything is on hold now,'' the spokesman said. ``They're not
going to capture any dolphins until June 15 and there could be an
extension,'' the spokesman said. ``A lot depends on whether the
die-off continues, whether it slows down or halts. We have to
figure out what caused the die-off.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Deny Misconduct in Espionage Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors denied they engaged in
any misconduct in the espionage case against former FBI agent
Richard Miller, saying a motion for dismissal of charges ``is
wholly without merit.''
   Miller, 52, was tried on espionage charges twice. The first
trial ended in a hung jury in 1985. The next year, a jury convicted
him of trading a secret FBI manual to Soviet informant Svetlana
Ogorodnikov in exchange for sex and money.
   The conviction was overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last April, and Miller was released on bail last October.
His third trial is scheduled to begin July 10 before U.S. District
Court Judge Robert M. Takasugi.
   Defense lawyers claimed in a motion filed in January that
charges against Miller should be dismissed because prosecutors
intentionally withheld information that could have benefited them.
The nature of the information was not disclosed.
   But two Justice Department lawyers told the court in briefs
filed Wednesday that the defense has conveyed ``a false sense of
conspiracy and wrongdoing on the part of the government.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys Russell Hayman and Adam Schiff
described the defense motion as ``a rehashing of ... old issues
with a new face'' that was ``wholly without merit.''
   They said defense contentions were rejected by U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon, who presided over Miller's trials and the trial
of Mrs. Ogorodnikov, with whom Miller had an affair in 1984.
   Kenyon removed himself from the case and Takasugi took over.

<TEXT>
   Operators briefly shut down the Seabrook
nuclear power in only its third day of operation because of a false
alarm Thursday, but a federal inspector called the move
conservative.
   Noel Dudley, resident inspector at Seabrook for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, said plant operator New Hampshire Yankee
shut down the reactor because of a spurious alarm received
intermittently from one of five banks of electronic controls for
the reactor's control rods.
   Dudley said each bank of controls has multiple power supply
units, and that nuclear power plants can operate safely for months
with one unit out of service.
   He agreed that the decision to shut down was conservative.
``They could have continued to operate,'' he said.
   Dudley said in a telephone interview from Seabrook that the
reactor was shut down about 8:30 a.m. It was put back in operation
at 2 p.m.
   A plant spokesman twice declined to confirm that the reactor had
been shut down. Rob Williams said he didn't know and would not
bother the control room to find out.
   ``We said all along that there would be shutdowns, and I don't
know whether there have been,'' Williams said.
   He said he wouldn't call the control room because ``we have made
a conscious decision that we are not going to be distracting the
control room staff for updates about the power level.''
   Plant officials have said reaching full power could take two to
three months, and that they expect problems.
   ``They're progressing with their startup very deliberately,''
Dudley said. ``They've not made any attempt to maintain their
schedule. They're identifying problems ... and resolving those
problems before they continue.''
   Other problems encountered during the first three days included
a steam leak from a valve in the plant's turbine building and a
``slight hydraulic leak,'' Dudley said. He said replacing sealing
rings fixed both problems.
   He said the problems were not surprising.
   ``A plant that's been sitting idle for over eight years, even
with the best of maintenance, you would expect that when you began
to operate ... you would identify some components of some systems
that would require work,'' he said.
   The delay was caused by regulation changes and court battles by
opponents of the plant.
   Seabrook foe Robert Backus, lawyer for the
Seacoast-Anti-Pollution League, said the problems confirm ``that
this plant is not ready and the license should not have been
issued.''
   ``If you went and bought a car _ this is supposed to be a
Cadillac, right? _ and you couldn't drive it the first mile because
there was a problem that required you to shut it down, you might
want to take it back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's an Expert on Running Against Women; Ferraro
Disagrees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that he's an
expert when it comes to running a political campaign against women,
but at least one female politician took exception to the contention.
   ``I don't know how he'd call himself an expert,'' former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro said from New York. ``Only in politics does one
little meeting an expert make.''
   Ferraro was Walter Mondale's vice presidential running mate in
the 1984 race against incumbent President Reagan and Vice President
Bush.
   Bush's comments at a news conference were prompted by a question
about the Texas gubernatorial race that may pit Democrat Ann
Richards against Republican Clayton Williams.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
Richards than Attorney General Jim Mattox. Richards, the state
treasurer, and Mattox will battle for the Democratic nomination in
an April 10 run-off election.
   Bush said he had some opinions about running against women,
calling himself ``an expert in the field'' because of his contest
against Ferraro.
   But Ferraro said Bush's memory of the race is flawed, and that
the only time they went head-to-head was in one televised debate.
   ``We did not run against each other. It was Fritz Mondale and
Ronald Reagan who were running against each other,'' Ferraro said.
``If we were both running against each other, if we were both at
the top of the ticket, then I think his comment about being an
expert would be valid.''
   Bush was asked if he had any advice for Williams.
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' Bush said.
   Ferraro, meanwhile, said Richards didn't need any advice from
her.
   ``Ann has run against men before. I'm sure she's not
uncomfortable with it,'' Ferraro said, suggesting Williams' problem
may be a common male ailment.
   ``The only way I can see it, being uncomfortable, is when you
lose to a man it's humiliating enough,'' she said. ``But if you're
a macho guy and you lose to a woman, it has to be devastating.''

   The card depicts a globe atop a book and the legend, ``The world

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the card ``marks the

<TEXT>
   American farmers have been guaranteed a major
portion of the Soviet Union's grain import market for another five
years, officials announced Thursday.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla A. Hills said a tentative agreement in
principle was reached during negotiations in Vienna.
   The current pact, which has been in effect since 1983, expires
Dec. 31.
   The new accord will increase the annual minimum shipments of
U.S. grain to the Soviets to 10 million metric tons from 9 million
tons _ a guarantee of 50 million tons over the five years, compared
with 45 million tons under the old terms.
   Soviet purchases in most years have exceeded the required
minimums. In 1988-89, for example, sales were more than double the
specified minimum.
   ``We think this is a good deal, that it assures U.S. farmers of
a stable market over the life of the agreement,'' Julius Katz,
deputy U.S. trade representative, said in Vienna.
   Katz said details of the pact would be disclosed after it is
signed at the June summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Howard Lyman, a lobbyist for the National Farmers Union, said
the pact was in line with the group's support of such long-term
agreements.
   ``We think it's great,'' he said.
   However, economist John A. Schnittker questioned whether the
agreement was needed.
   ``I've never considered these agreements to be necessary for
continuation of trade,'' he said. ``In my opinion, we would be
selling just as much. They need the stuff, we've got the stuff,
they're going to buy it when they need it.''
   Farmers welcomed the announcement but some restrained their
enthusiasm until they could learn more.
   ``I'm not going to jump up and down and say this is great stuff
until I have all the details,'' said Gary Rees, who farms 550 acres
at Crawfordsville, Iowa.
   ``I really don't know how big a deal it really is,'' said Dick
Naeve of Humboldt, who works 750 acres at Humboldt, Iowa. He
observed, ``Their people want a better diet, so they're probably
going to have to import more over the next couple of years.''
   Commodity markets barely reacted at all; traders said the news
had been epected. Wheat futures closed { cent per bushel lower to
1{ cents lower; corn was { cent to 1{ cents higher.
   The Kremlin will have some greater year-to-year flexibility
under the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat
and feed grains, although over the life of the pact the minimums
will be met, officials said.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets will be committed to buying at
least 4 million tons each of wheat and feed grains. However, in any
one year Moscow may substitute up to 750,000 tons of one commodity
for the other.
   For the first time, the agreement includes barley and sorghum as
well as corn under the definition of feed grains.
   Additional flexibility also was provided by giving Moscow
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually
without further discussion with Washington.
   The automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons,
although the United States has routinely increased that to fit
Soviet needs.
   As of March 8, the Soviets had bought more than 13.8 million
tons of U.S. wheat and corn under the current agreement for
delivery this year. Last year's sales totaled a record 21.7 million
tons.
   Effectively, over five years, U.S. farmers will be assured a
Soviet market for at least 20 million tons of wheat and 20 million
tons of feed grains, with an additional 10 million tons that can be
made up of wheat, feed grains, soybeans or soybean meal.
   Although it makes up a hefty share, the Soviet Union's grain
purchases by no means tell the whole story of U.S. grain exports.
   Total wheat shipments in 1989-90 are forecast at 35.4 million
tons, and so-called coarse grains, or feed grains, at 66.4 million
tons.

   Five astronauts who will deploy the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope from the shuttle Discovery said
Thursday excitement is mounting at NASA as the April 12 launch date
draws closer.
   The astronomical observatory, nearly seven years late in lifting
off, will be placed in orbit 370 miles above Earth and enable
scientists to see things so distant that their light has taken
almost since the beginning of the universe to reach Earth.
   ``I think I can speak for everybody in that we can feel the
excitement building quite a bit now in these last few weeks. We're
just glad to be finally this close to launch,'' said Air Force Col.
Loren J. Shriver, the crew's commander.
   ``We'll all feel a little bit of disbelief that we're finally
getting to do this. We'll probably all feel a certain amount of
pride,'' mission specialist Steven A. Hawley said at a news
conference.
   Hawley is scheduled to use the shuttle's robot arm to deploy the
telescope on the second day of the five-day mission.
   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feel
because it's been so long,'' said Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden
Jr., the mission's pilot.
   The Hubble, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built,
originally was scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technical
problems postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986. The Challenger
explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, delayed the mission until 1989, and
concern over the shuttle's solid fuel booster rockets pushed it
back yet again.
   From its orbit, the 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long telescope will be
able to detect light of all wavelengths, including ultraviolet,
before it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere.
   The telescope will look seven times more deeply into space and
detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity
than the best ground-based observatory. Its eight-foot primary
optical mirror is the most precise ever made.
   Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant
that their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.
Scientists believe the universe is 15 billion years old.
   The other crew members are mission specialists Kathryn D.
Sullivan and Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain, who both said
they are ready to go on a spacewalk if necessary to repair or
retrieve the observatory if necessary after deployment.
   Shriver said he is not concerned about damaged axle nuts found
on the nose wheels of Atlantis and Columbia and suspected to be the
same on Discovery. NASA temporarily delayed Discovery's move to the
launch pad last week until technicians concluded there was no
threat to the mission.
   Because of their prestigious payload, the astronauts have found
themselves the subject of considerable attention and even a little
envy within NASA.
   ``There's no such thing as a bad mission,'' Hawley said. ``But I
think there are a lot of people who would like to trade places with
us.''

   Twenty people were killed and
56 injured in South Africa in black factional fighting and protests
against the white-dominated government, police and news reports
said Thursday.
   Authorities also arrested or fired 109 police and prison
officers who mounted strikes and protests Wednesday to demand
equality with white employees.
   The violence was reported the same day U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III met with President F.W. de Klerk to encourage
more reform by his government. De Klerk said he would like to lift
the national state of emergency as soon as political violence
subsides.
   Six people were killed and 34 injured when a vehicle plowed
through a mob blocking the main road between East London and the
black township of Mdantsane in eastern Cape province, the South
African Broadcasting Corp. said Thursday.
   It gave no details, but there have been numerous incidents of
white drivers speeding up their cars or firing guns when they were
attacked by crowds of blacks on the roads.
   A police statement Thursday reported widespread unrest during
the previous 24 hours. It said police riot squads using shotguns,
rubber bullets and tear gas broke up groups of black protesters.
   Tens of thousands of blacks mounted a 24-hour strike Wednesday
to mark the 30th anniversary of the 1960 ``Sharpeville Massacre,''
when police killed 69 blacks during a protest march.
   Some of the victims reported Thursday were killed in black
factional violence that has killed more than 300 people in the past
month. Police did not give a breakdown on the reasons for all 14
deaths listed in official reports.
   But they said a 12-year-old boy was hacked to death Thursday in
a battle between township residents and migrant workers living in
hostels at Ikegeng, 62 miles southwest of Johannesburg. The hostels
and 20 cars were destroyed in a fire that caused $380,000 damage,
police said.
   Thousands of people went on strike or stayed home Thursday in
the nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana north of
Pretoria to mark the funeral of six people killed by police in a
protest earlier this month.
   Some police and prison officers held strikes or protests
Wednesday to demand equality with white officers, including equal
pay. About half of the South African Police is non-white.
   Police commanders said 41 police officers were dismissed for
striking or conspiring to strike. Among those dismissed was Lt.
Gregory Rockman, a mixed-race officer suspended in November after
organizing the new union for police and prison guards.
   Police also said, without elaborating, that 68 striking prison
officers were arrested at Pollsmoor Prison near Cape Town after
they took part in a protest meeting Wednesday.

   The government expanded its recall of
L-tryptophan Thursday because of fears that a sometimes fatal blood
disorder can be caused even by small doses of the dietary
supplement used for insomnia, depression and weight control.
   ``We are confronted with a major public health problem,'' Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan warned in the
announcement by the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``I urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately.''
   L-tryptophan is an amino acid that occurs naturally in some
foods that are high in protein, such as milk, beef, turkey and
beans. But it is also sold over the counter as a manufactured
dietary supplement, and it may be contained in various diet and
weight loss products.
   It has been linked to a blood disorder called
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS.
   So far, 1,411 cases of EMS _ including 19 deaths _ have been
reported, the FDA said. Cases have been reported in every state.
   The recall applies to all L-tryptophan products in tablet,
capsule, caplet, powdered or liquid form, as well multi-ingredient,
non-protein supplements that contain L-tryptophan, the FDA said.
   The only products containing L-tryptophan not being recalled are
some protein supplements, infant formulas, special dietary foods,
intravenous and oral solutions, in which small amounts of
L-tryptophan are needed for nutrition fortification, the FDA said.
No cases of EMS have been linked to any of these uses, the agency
said.
   It was not clear whether certain products like diet weight loss
and body-building supplements containing L-tryptophan would have to
be recalled. Some of these are formulated according to FDA
regulations. The FDA said it would issue a clarification further
defining what is subject to the recall.
   L-tryptophan is not an FDA-approved drug ingredient and has not
been considered a drug.
   L-tryptophan dietary supplements are sold in health food stores,
drug stores and supermarkets. Retail sales are estimated at $50
million to $75 million a year.
   Buyers use the supplement for insomnia, appetite control,
depression, premenstrual syndrome, stress reduction and other
problems.
   The Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents
manufacturers of nutritional supplements, endorsed the FDA's
action. Its president, J.B. Cordaro, said ``I wish they'd done it a
month ago.''
   The council has been recommending for more than a month that its
members stop distribution of all products that contain L-tryptophan
and that consumers stop using it, he said.
   Cordaro said that the largest manufacturers of L-tryptophan
products have taken them off the market, ``and if there are a few
of the smaller ones that still have it, it's insignificant.''
   The council identified the two largest manufacturers of
L-tryptophan dietary supplements as P. Leiner Nutritional Products
Corp. in Torrance, Calif., and Pharmavite Corp. in Arleta, Calif.
   Kevin Lanigan, senior vice president at P. Leiner, said that a
week before the FDA's initial Nov. 17 recall, the company stopped
manufacture and shipping of all its L-tryptophan products. The
company also notified all of its customers and advised them to
remove it from their shelves, he said.
   Neither Lanigan or the FDA could provide brand names of the
products since hundreds of products are involved.
   Kenneth Rosenberg, chief executive officer of Pharmavite Corp.,
said his company distributed L-tryptophan dietary supplements under
about 20 different brand names, including its own brand, Nature
Made, as well as store labels for various retail chains.
   Pharmavite also stopped shipping its products before the FDA's
initial recall last November, and notified its customers and
provided them with signs warning consumers about the problem, said
Rosenberg.
   FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said the L-tryptophan recall is
unusual in that normally the FDA identifies a specific hazard or
contaminant and knows who the manufacturer is, how much was made,
and where and when it was distributed.
   EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing
difficulties, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash, fatigue,
cough and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims show signs of
congestive heart failure or develop a condition that causes
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis.
   Sullivan warned: ``EMS can cripple. It can cause great pain. It
can kill. It has had long-term effects on some unfortunate
individuals, and some patients are not responding to treatment.''
   The FDA initially recalled only the larger dose forms of the
product, those that would result in daily intake of 100 milligrams
or more a day. That was based on evidence from the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta that EMS victims had taken
L-tryptophan in doses that ranged from 150 to 17,000 milligrams a
day. Most were taking 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams daily.
   However, at least one case of the disorder has been reported on
less than 100 milligrams a day, the FDA said.
   The rate of EMS has slowed dramatically since the initial Nov.
17 recall, but officials said some of the recent victims apparently
had continued using L-tryptophan products after the recall began.
   The FDA earlier was investigating whether L-tryptophan itself or
some contaminant introduced during manufacture or distribution was
causing the syndrome. FDA investigators visited plants in Japan, a
leading supplier of the raw L-tryptophan to U.S. manufacturers.
   However, investigators have been unable to identify any
contaminants that could be responsible, nor have they linked the
illness to any single lot, brand, manufacturer or supplier.
   The FDA's action was taken after its Health Hazard Evaluation
Board advised that ``the risk of contracting EMS due to the
consumption of any dietary L-tryptophan product far outweighs any
perceived benefit that may be derived from the continued marketing
of this product in any dosage form.''

   One of the last persons to receive a
Jarvik artifical heart before federal approval of the device was
withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor
organ. He spent 87 days on the device.
   Carl E. Bryant, 43, of Louisville, died Wednesday, eight hours
after the transplant operation, said doctors at Louisville's Jewish
Hospital.
   ``We did everything we could for Carl Bryant,'' said Dr. Laman
A. Gray Jr., who transplanted the heart.
   Physicians said the donor heart, which became available late
Tuesday, met the criteria for transplantation. But the left
ventricle, or main pumping chamber, failed to function once the
heart was inside Bryant.
   The Jarvik 7-70 assist device was implanted Dec. 22 at Humana
Hospital-Audubon by Dr. William DeVries, who pioneered use of the
artificial heart.
   ``The transplant surgery offered Carl's only real chance for
survival,'' DeVries said in a statement Wednesday.
   Bryant was the second-to-last person to receive a Jarvik pump in
this country before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration withdrew
its approval of the device Jan. 8, said Gary Cole, an executive
vice president with Symbion Inc., the Arizona manufacturer of the
pumps.
   The agency said its inspections uncovered ``serious
deficiencies'' in the way Symbion was carrying out studies with the
device. In February, the FDA said it would allow use of the device
as a last resort, but only when all other available treatments had
failed and when no other life-saving device could be used.
   The device was last implanted in the United States in Columbus,
Ohio, on Dec. 31, Cole said Thursday. He said two Jarvik pumps have
been implanted in other countries since the FDA withdrawal. Cole
said 159 Jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants
since 1985.
   He said the longest-surviving patient to use the Jarvik while
awaiting a donor organ was a French woman. She lived 603 days on
the device.
   Dr. Barney Clark, the first person implanted with a Jarvik
heart, died in 1983 after 112 days on the device. He received a
Jarvik-7, which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his
heart.
   Bryant had a massive heart attack in July and underwent cardiac
catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary
artery.
   His wife, Cynthia, took him to the hospital Dec. 16 after he
complained of chest pains. Three hours before he was to undergo
triple bypass surgery, Bryant suffered a second massive heart
attack.
   DeVries implanted the Jarvik device during a six-hour procedure.
   ``I have no qualms about Carl being on the assist device at
all,'' Cynthia Bryant said. ``It worked wonderfully and may further
research to help someone else. And we had three good months
together that we would not have had otherwise.''

<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lesotho's military ruler, who sent the
king into exile last month claiming he needed a vacation, said
Thursday he had staged a coup in this tiny southern African nation.
   It was the first time Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya characterized
what he did as a coup.
   On Feb. 19, Lekhanya dismissed all ministers who supported King
Moshoeshoe. Then, on March 10, he sent the king himself into exile
in England, saying the monarch needed a rest.
   Lekhanya's statement Thursday came in an affidavit to the High
Court. Former Health Minister Strong Makenete has filed a case with
the court challenging his dismissal as invalid.
   Lekhanya said Makenete's application was frivolous because he
and other ministers were ousted in a coup. The ruler said the
Council of Ministers no longer exists.
   Lekhanya and his Military Council have held the government in
sway since a January 1986 coup against leftist strongman Leabua
Jonathan. The military initially helped Jonathan keep power after
he lost a post-independence election.
   Lekhanya said the king retained legislative and executive powers
after the 1986 coup, but was supposed to govern with the advice of
the Military Council.
   Last month, Lekhanya dismissed two high-ranking relatives of the
king and other supporters of the monarch. When Moshoeshoe refused
to approve replacements, Lekhanya stripped the king of authority
and deported him.
   Lekhanya said he and his remaining supporters on the Military
Council would govern until Lesotho returns to civilian rule. He has
said that will take place in June 1992.
   A statement signed by 14 of the country's 22 traditional chiefs
was published Thursday objecting to the treatment of the king.
   Lesotho, which became independent from Britain in 1966, is
completely surrounded by South Africa.

   A House committee approved a compromise
Thursday on tougher smog controls in a clean air bill, while a
proposal for financial aid to coal miners still held up movement on
similar legislation in the Seante.
   The 38-2 vote by the House Energy and Commerce Committee created
one areas of likely conflict when the Senate and House versions of
the two bills eventually have to be reconciled. The Senate earlier
in the week rejected some of the same smog controls.
   Meanwhile, Senate leaders worked with the White House and Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in an attempt to find a way to resolve the
dispute over the coal miner assistance.
   A vote on the amendment, brought to the floor by Byrd nearly two
weeks ago, has been postponed at least twice. Senate leaders are
fearful that Byrd has the votes to get it passed. That could
unravel the compromise legislation worked out with the White House,
they fear, because of the temptation it would pose for lawmakers to
claim similar aid for other industries.
   By evening the coal aid amendment had yet to surface again,
though Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had said earlier
in the day the matter would ``be resolved one way or another''
Thursday.
   The House committee vote came after two days of negotitions
among committee leaders, including Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
chairman. Many members voted only minutes after having first seen
the inch-thick document.
   The House provisions would continue to allow the Environmental
Protection Agency to impose an air pollution control plan if local
officials fail to act, would bring many small businesses under
smog-control regulations in cities with the dirtiest air, and would
eliminate certain waivers now possible on grounds that compliance
would cost too much. These were provisions the Senate rejected
earlier in the week.
   The Senate spent much time on marginal amendments.
   The Byrd proposal calls for a $500 million program to help
miners who lose their jobs from tougher acid rain pollution
controls. The White House calls the plan too expensive and has
lobbied hard against it.
   But Byrd, one of the Senate's most influential and most powerful
members as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, returned to
the Senate floor Thursday to plead his case.
   ``The coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price. ...
They will lose their livelihood,'' declared Byrd, calling the
assistance program essential to help 5,000 miners who are likely to
lose their jobs.
   Mitchell, meanwhile, was working with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
minority leader, to try to get the White House to produce a
compromise aid package that might be agreeable to Byrd.
   Mitchell and Dole have said they are concerned that passage of
the assistance program would cause the White House to drop support
for the compromise clean air legislation that was agreed to in
lengthy closed-door negotiations between Senate leaders and the
Bush administration.
   If the deal falls apart there likely will be no clean air bill
from the Senate this year, Mitchell maintained earlier in the week.
   On Wednesday night, Byrd offered to lower the package's expected
cost from $700 million over four years to $500 million over three
years. Now, he said, he would retreat no further.
   ``I'm not going to stand here and say I've got 51 votes (needed
for passage), but I can tell you, `You don't have 51 votes either.'
And I can tell you I'm very close,'' Byrd told Mitchell as debate
on the issue continued late into the night Wednesday.
   Byrd complained that the White House had been unwilling to
negotiate with him, so ``I've negotiated with myself.'' Originally
Byrd had sought a much broader aid package, which could have cost
$1.6 billion over six years.
   Byrd argued that coal miners should be singled out for help
because the bill, which calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions
from electric utilities by 10 million tons a year by the end of the
decade, takes ``direct aim'' at these workers.
   Industry has argued forcefully among senators in recent weeks
that the tougher proposed controls on toxic industrial chemical
releases would cost thousands of jobs in the steel, chemical and
petroleum industries.

<HEAD>More Violence Buffets Haiti, Politician's Wife Shot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Slum-dwellers reportedly beat to
death a Duvalier loyalist and gunmen wounded a political leader's
wife Thursday on the fourth straight day of street violence blamed
on opponents of Haiti's new government.
   A group of civic and political leaders fingered loyalists to the
ousted Duvalier family regime as inciting violence in the hopes of
destabilizing the interim civilian government of Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot.
   Since Sunday, dozens of people have been wounded and at least 21
killed in a rash of attacks. Civic activists say most responsible
for the unrest are thugs angered by last week's shift of power from
the ruling military.
   Marie-Michele de Ronceray, wife of conservative politician
Hubert de Ronceray, was shot in the left shoulder by assailants as
she was being driven home in suburban Fontamara, a member de
Ronceray's Mobilization for National Development party told The
Associated Press.
   Mrs. de Ronceray and her driver ``saw the aggressors, two armed
men,'' said party member Dieudonne Laroche. ``They deliberately
aimed at Mrs. de Ronceray,'' who was hospitalized in a nearby
Adventist clinic.
   De Ronceray, a prominent conservative politician, was one of
seven critics forced into exile by the military ruler Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril during a crackdown in January. De Ronceray, his wife,
and their 7-year-old son returned from exile in Miami last week
after Avril fled the country March 10.
   In the Bolosse slum, an angry mob Thursday beat to death and
burned the remains of Romer Deruisseaux, a former member of
ex-dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's dreaded militia, Radio Antilles
and Radio Metropole said.
   In another attack in suburban Delmas, a money-changer was shot
to death and robbed by unidentified men riding a motorcycle, the
radio stations said.
   Leaders of the Unity Assembly, a coalition of civic and
political groups that led protests that brought down Avril's regime
this month, said the violence was the work of Duvalier loyalists.
   ``The only political sector excluded from the caretaker
government is that of the hard-line Duvalierists. They are making a
last-ditch effort to dash to pieces our hopes for democracy,'' said
center-left politician Jean-Claude Roy, a coalition member.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, sworn in as provisional president March
13, has vowed to turn over power to an elected government this
year. The army has pledged to support her government.
   Haiti has had four short-lived regimes since Jean-Claude ``Baby
Doc'' Duvalier, son of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, was swept
from power in a popular uprising and fled to France in February
1986. His father ruled from 1957.

   Communists who refused to follow the
reformist trend applauded warnings on Thursday that a market
economy and ``bourgeois'' ideas would destroy their hard-won
welfare.
   About 2,000 people attended a rally in Budapest's Peoples'
Stadium to show support for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party
_ Communists who refused to embrace reform that led others to
renounce their Stalinist past and opt for democracy.
   The rally was held three days before Hungary's first free
national elections in 42 years and was attended by mostly elderly
Marxists.
   The audience presented a marked contrast to the rollicking crowd
gathered at the stadium Wednesday to show support for FIDESZ, the
iconoclastic League of Free Democrats who have poked fun at the
Communists for much of the campaign.
   After decades of assured single-party rule, the Communists find
they must scramble for votes if they hope to gain any seats at all
in the new parliament.
   ``We can bring back socialism with our vote,'' appealed the
splinter party's new leader, Gyula Thuermer, to rousing applause.
   Many of the crowd appeared to be blue-collar workers. FIDESZ
draws much of its support from college-educated adults.
   ``There will be great unemployment if the capitalists take
over,'' the 36-year-old Thuermer warned. ``Let's preserve the unity
of the workers. ... Don't believe what the bourgeois parties
promise you.''
   The orderly audience applauded rhythmically in response to his
promises of increased pensions, free education and prospects for
betterment. He said that was all threatened by the coming democracy
and market economy most other parties pledge to institute as the
only way to pull Hungary out of an economic slump.

   Lew Allen Jr. will retire Sept. 30 as
director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, capping a career in which he
guided NASA's unmanned space program, the Air Force and the
supersecret National Security Agency.
   ``I'm delighted to be able to leave at a time when the future of
the space program looks very bright and the activities at JPL in
connection with the exploration of the solar system look very
promising indeed,'' Allen said Wednesday.
   JPL's Magellan spacecraft will reach Venus in August, the
Galileo spacecraft is bound for a 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter,
Mars Observer is set for launch in 1992, and the lab is gearing up
for future lunar and Mars explorations under President Bush's space
initiative.
   Allen, 64, a physicist, said he and his wife ``would like to
travel some and smell the roses a bit'' when he retires on his 65th
birthday.
   He has spent eight years as JPL director and vice president of
the California Institute of Technology. Caltech operates the
laboratory for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Allen oversaw the Voyager 2 spacecraft's explorations of Uranus
in 1986 and Neptune last summer, and the completion of the 1982-83
survey of heat-emitting objects in space by the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite.
   Allen retired in 1982 as a general and Air Force chief of staff,
a post that made him a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the
president's principal military advisers. President Carter named
Allen to that post in 1978.
   In 1973, President Nixon appointed Allen director of the
National Security Agency, which reportedly has the largest budget
of any U.S. intelligence agency and operates much of America's
network of spy satellites and electronic surveillance. He held that
post until 1977, when he was named head of Air Force Systems
Command.
   Journalist Frederick Kempe's recent book ``Divorcing the
Dictator'' said that in 1976 Allen urged prosecution of Manuel
Antonio Noriega after the Panamanian general bribed U.S. officials
to obtain secret intelligence tapes.
   But the book said then-CIA Director George Bush balked, allowing
Noriega to go unpunished and continue receiving $110,000 per year
from the CIA for his supposed cooperation with the agency. Bush
ordered the recent invasion that ousted Noriega.

   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
testified Thursday he never became suspicious of John Poindexter,
even when evidence suggested Poindexter covered up the U.S. role in
a missile shipment to Iran.
   Appearing as a defense witness at Poindexter's trial, Meese told
the jury that ``everything I know'' suggests the former national
security adviser tried to give him an accurate account of the
November 1985 delivery at a meeting a year later.
   ``Did Admiral Poindexter ever tell you a lie?'' asked defense
attorney Richard Beckler.
   ``Not to my knowledge,'' responded the former attorney general.
   Poindexter tried to ``convey an accurate'' story on the missile
shipment? asked Beckler.
   ``Everything I know about it is he did,'' said Meese.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb questioned Meese about a Nov.
20, 1986, meeting in Poindexter's office during which several
participants, including Oliver North, adopted a false cover story
about the shipment. The story was that no one in the U.S.
government knew at the time of the shipment that Hawk missiles were
aboard.
   Meese was asked if he knew then that Poindexter had been
``involved in that Hawks shipment''
   ``No, I did not know that then and I do not know that today,''
Meese replied.
   Webb showed Meese a copy of a Nov. 20, 1985, computer message
from North to Poindexter about the impending shipment. Meese
responded by saying he didn't know whether Poindexter received the
message.
   After the meeting in Poindexter's office, Meese was told by a
political aide the U.S. government may have known about the missile
shipment after all. Two days later, Meese first learned that
then-President Reagan had signed a document, known as a finding,
authorizing CIA assistance in the shipment, according to testimony
at the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.
   Wasn't Meese suspicious about the assertions of no U.S.
knowledge when there was a presidential finding ratifying the
shipment? asked Webb.
   ``No I was not suspicious of that,'' said Meese. The CIA said it
had found out about the missiles only as the shipment was under
way, and the finding was signed by Reagan a week and a half after
the delivery, explained Meese.
   The politically embarrassing finding depicted the U.S. role in
Iran arms sales as an attempt to trade arms for hostages.
Poindexter tore up the document on Nov. 21, 1986, hours talking
with members of Congress about the missile shipment.
   The former national security adviser is accused of conspiracy,
obstructing Congress and making false statements by saying that he
didn't learn of the delivery until January 1986.
   When Meese told the president on Nov. 21 a fact-finding inquiry
was being started on the Iran initiative, did Poindexter ``jump
up'' and say he had a copy of the finding ``in my safe?'' asked
Webb.
   ``No, he did not,'' said Meese.
   ``During this time ... did John Poindexter ever tell you he had
destroyed this finding that had been signed by the president of the
United States?'' asked Webb.
   ``No,'' replied Meese.
   At the Nov. 20 meeting at which Poindexter presided, did Meese
hear any discussion of a false cover story? asked Beckler.
   ``No I did not,'' replied Meese. ``I am sure nothing like that
was ever said in my presence at that meeting.''
   Meese said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the
information being presented by the CIA and North.
   Why was it necessary for `everybody ... to get together'' at the
Nov. 20, 1986 meeting? asked U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene.
   To prepare CIA director William Casey for his congressional
testimony the next day on the Iran initiative, responded Meese.
   Poindexter had asked Meese to come to the meeting to ensure that
Reagan administration officials could testify ``truthfully and
accurately,'' Meese said at one point.
   Earlier Thursday, Poindexter's lawyers finished the courtroom
showing of nearly eight hours of videotaped testimony from Reagan.
   In it, Reagan suggested that it might have been all right to
destroy documents or withhold information from Congress in order to
safeguard the lives of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   Reagan said that if there were leaks from Congress about aspects
of the Iran initiative, the hostages could be endangered.
   Poindexter is accused of deleting 5,000 files from his computer
system to keep Congress from knowing the U.S. role in the missile
shipment.
   Poindexter also is accused of conspiring with North to destroy
and alter memos that showed North's military assistance to the
Contras.
   ``Is it ... fair to say that at no time in November of 1986 did
you ever authorize ... any one at the National Security Council to
destroy or alter any record that related to the Iran-Contra
controversy?'' asked prosecutor Dan Webb.
   ``I don't know,'' replied Reagan, saying that he had ``pointed
out that there were things that could not be made public because of
the risk of death to a number of people.''
   ``There were times and experience that told us that Congress was
not in many instances capable of the kind of security that we
required,'' Reagan said at one point.

<HEAD>Psychologist for Murder Defendants Seeks Return of Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychologist for two brothers
charged in the shotgun slayings of their millionaire parents asked
a judge Thursday to retrieve tape recordings that police seized
from his office.
   Attorney Brad Bunnon said the recordings and other records taken
from psychologist Jerome Oziel's office after police served search
warrants March 8 ``were not turned over voluntarily'' and should
not be admissible in a trial.
   Los Angeles County Superior Judge James Albracht said he would
consider the request at an April 4 hearing.
   Neither the prosecution nor the defense has revealed what is
contained in the recordings.
   Attorneys for Joseph Lyle Menendez, 22, and his brother Erik,
19, have argued that the recordings are confidential doctor-patient
records. The tapes were seized before police arrested Lyle Menendez
on March 8.
   Erik Menendez, a 19-year-old tennis pro, surrendered the
following weekend after returning from playing a tennis tournament
in Israel.
   The brothers have been charged with two counts of homicide each
in the slayings of Jose Menendez, 45, and Mary Louise ``Kitty''
Menendez, 44. They were to be arraigned Monday on two counts of
murder each at Beverly Hills Municipal Court.
   The couple were shot to death Aug. 20 in their $5 million
Beverly Hills mansion. The sons reported finding the bodies upon
returning from a night on the town.
   The young men are heirs to the $14 million estate of Menendez,
an executive of Live Entertainment Inc., a video distribution
company.
   Police have said two killers committed the crime, then picked up
shell casings from the 12-gauge shotguns they used before fleeing.
   Prosecutors have said the tapes constitute key evidence.
   ``The prosecution will go on in this case with or without the
tapes,'' Deputy District Attorney Elliott Alhadeff said Thursday.
   State law allows psychologists' patient records to be used as
evidence if there is a threat of continued violence. Alhadeff said
earlier this month that Oziel was threatened.
   Defense attorney Gerald Chaleff has said he was aware of no
threat against Oziel or anyone else.

<HEAD>Havel Vows No More Sales of Semtex Explosives to Libya</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel said Thursday that
Czechoslovakia sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex explosive but will
not be exporting any more of the virtually undetectable substance
favored by terrorists.
   Security experts say Semtex was used was the terrorist bombing
of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988,
which killed 259 people on board the plane and 11 on the ground.
   Semtex, made exclusively in Czechoslovakia, is an odorless,
orange-yellow explosive that looks like children's play-dough. It
can be molded into any shape and is 1,000 times more powerful than
conventional explosives. It is almost undetectable to conventional
anti-terrorist devices.
   Havel, speaking through a translator at a news conference at the
Czechoslovak Embassy on the second day of a three-day official
visit, said, ``If you consider that it takes 200 grams (7 ounces)
to blow up an aircraft, this means world terrorism has enough
Semtex to last for 150 years.''
   Havel did not say Czechoslovakia would stop making Semtex, but
defended its production for peaceful use.
   ``This is an industrial explosive necessary for various
industrial uses. It is not an explosive made especially for
terrorists,'' he said. But, ``Now we want to mark Semtex so it will
be detectable.''
   ``The past regime exported 1,000 tons to Libya. ... We ceased
exporting this explosive some time ago.''
   Havel, who became president last Dec. 29, gave no date or
details.
   But Jiri Novy, director of the plant northeast of Prague that
makes Semtex, told The Associated Press that exports stopped in
1988.
   He said Libya received ``over 900'' tons of the explosive in
1981 and that additional exports were made to Eastern Europe until
1988.
   The British Foreign Office said formal exports of Semtex
continued to Hungary and East Germany until 1989.
   Britain's Press Association said Semtex has been the Irish
Republican Army's chief weapon against British rule in Northern
Ireland since late 1986, and was used in the September bombing of
the Royal Marines School of Music in Kent, which killed 10 people.
   The news agency, quoting unidentified security officials, said
the explosive was smuggled into Ireland from Libya in 1985 and 1986.
   Traces of a chemical constituent of Semtex were found in the
wreckage of a UTA DC-10 that blew up over Niger in 1989, killing
170 people.
   Czechoslovakia has long been a major arms manufacturer. It
produces hand grenades, automatic rifles, tanks and armored
personnel carriers.
   Published reports say the export of such weapons and components
accounted for up to one-half of Czechoslovakia's foreign-exchange
earnings. The nation, suffering from a crumbling economy and
strapped for hard currency, may find it difficult to stop the trade.
   Under the hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes and Gustav
Husak, Czechoslovakia found a market among nations too poor to
afford expensive Western weapons or those denied access for
political reasons.
   Besides Libya, clients included Angola, South Yemen and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Havel promised on Tuesday that Czechoslovakia's arms industry
will no longer sell weapons to dictatorial or totalitarian regimes.
   ``We are studying reconversion of our military industry,'' he
told a news conference in Paris, where he met with President
Francois Mitterrand, before coming to London. ``Don't hold it
against us if we continue to furnish arms for a little while to
democratic governments.''
   Havel met with business people and business organizations
Thursday, exploring possible areas for economic cooperation.
   He arrived Wednesday to a red-carpet welcome and luncheon at
Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth II, then had talks with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at her 10 Downing St. office and
residence.
   He said they discussed the future of Europe and German
unification.
   ``I told her that the process of unification should be
understood as a sort of engine propelling the unification of the
whole of Europe,'' he told reporters.
   Havel returns to Prague on Friday.

<HEAD>Official: De Klerk's Reform Efforts Parallel Those of Gorbachev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk's
attempts to abolish apartheid in South Africa can be compared to
the reform efforts of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a
senior U.S. official said Thursday.
   ``There are some parallels,'' he told reporters traveling with
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who met with de Klerk
for more than an hour Thursday in the first such high-level
encounter in 12 years.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
President Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and other
leading black nationalists told him ``de Klerk is a man of
integrity and so far his word has been good.''
   Baker had ``not believed de Klerk's government 13 months ago
when it said it was going to run on a program of abolishing
apartheid,'' the official said. He said Baker ``now believes these
people are quite serious and that they are committed to an
irreversible process and that they are anxious to move quickly.''
   Baker told de Klerk during a 75-minute meeting that ``what he
had done so far was courageous in light of the obvious political
pressures and restraints he is subject to,'' the official said.
   A second U.S. official said skeptics should recall that
Gorbachev's sincerity and ability to make radical changes also were
questioned when he first came to power in 1985.
   The praise marks the latest in a series of diplomatic successes
this week for a government that has been isolated by most nations
for more than a decade. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd met
de Klerk on Monday and invited him to visit Britain in May for a
meeting with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. President Bush has
invited de Klerk to Washington.
   On Wednesday de Klerk held an unprecedented meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Namibia, where they
attended independence ceremonies for the territory formerly ruled
by South Africa.
   After meeting Baker on Thursday afternoon, the South African
president met with President Siad Barre of Somalia,
government-controlled television reported without fanfare. A visit
by an African head of state to South Africa would have been treated
as a major event a few months ago.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said no South African head of state
had been in such demand since Jan Smuts at the end of World War II.
   Baker met de Klerk despite opposition from Mandela and other
leaders in the fight against South Africa's racial segregation
policy. Flanked by de Klerk and Botha on the steps of the
president's official residence, Baker said, ``De Klerk told me we
are engaged here in South Africa in an irreversible process and we
will follow it to its logical conclusion.''
   De Klerk was asked whether blacks would be granted equal voting
rights and a black could become president in his lifetime.
   ``I have just won an election asking for a mandate to attain
exactly that,'' he replied. ``We are working toward that, yes,
where all South Africans will have a vote, where that vote will be
of equal value ... (with) proper protection of minority rights so
there won't be domination built into the system. Not minority
domination but also not simple majority domination.''
   Baker arrived Thursday from Namibia and met a delegation of 11
anti-apartheid leaders at the U.S. ambassador's Cape Town residence
before seeing de Klerk.
   The ANC members repeated Mandela's criticism of the Baker visit,
saying it would give the world the impression fundamental progress
had been made in moving toward a non-racial democracy. But no
demonstrations against the visit occurred, and the activists
laughed and smiled as they walked out of the meeting. Mandela
cautioned reporters Wednesday, after meeting Baker in Windhoek, the
Namibian capital, to concentrate on areas of agreement between
black nationalists and the United States.
   Baker repeatedly said he did not believe the dispute over the
meeting would cloud future negotiations or the U.S. government's
standing with anti-apartheid groups.
   The secretary said he told de Klerk that lifting the state of
emergency, which gives police wide powers to restrict protests and
detain people, would be an important symbol that the reform process
was moving forward.
   Botha said the government wants to end the emergency as soon as
possible, but a recent upsurge of violence was holding up its
cancellation. More than 300 people have died since Mandela was
released from prison last month.
   Thursday's meeting with de Klerk included talks on Angola, de
Klerk told reporters. Baker is to meet soon in Kinshasa, Zaire with
President Mobutu Sese Seko and Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi in a bid to arrange a new cease-fire in the 15-year-old war
across Namibia's northern border.
   Baker has expressed hope that new flexibility on the part of
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos may speed implementation
of a cease-fire, but it appeared unlikely a truce could be arranged
before the secretary returns to Washington on Saturday evening.

<HEAD>Comedian Richard Pryor in Aussie Hospital After Mild Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Richard Pryor is being
treated in an Australian hospital after suffering a mild heart
attack three days ago, doctors said Friday.
   The Wesley Hospital in a brief statement described Pryor's
condition as stable and said the 49-year-old probably will be
discharged early next week. It said he was admitted three days
earlier with chest pain and he was diagnosed as having suffered a
minor heart attack.
   ``His condition from the time of admission has been very
stable,'' the hospital added.
   It did not say when Pryor arrived in Australia and for how long
he would stay.
   Pryor has appeared thin and in poor health in recent public
appearances.
   He is best known as the star of several movies based on his
stand-up comedy performances, including ``Richard Pryor Here and
Now,'' ``Richard Pryor Live in Concert'' and ``Richard Pryor Is
Back Live in Concert.''
   Pryor's agent in Los Angeles, Guy McElwaine, did not return
repeated phone calls late Thursday.
   The comedian was nearly killed and burned severely in 1980 while
``freebasing'' cocaine. He recounted that experience and other
hardships in his life in the films ``Richard Pryor Live on the
Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Other film credits include ``Harlem Nights,'' ``Stir Crazy,''
``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' ``Brewster's Millions,'' ``Critical
Condition'' and ``Moving.''

noontime temperatures as low as the teens in the upper Midwest.
   Snow fell in the Idaho Panhandle, Montana, northern Wyoming,
much of South Dakota, North Dakota and northwest Minnesota.
   Gusty winds prompted advisories for blowing, drifting snow in
western Montana, northeastern North Dakota and Spokane, Wash.
   Snowfall in the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 1 inch
in Lewiston and Miles City, Mont.
   Rain fell on eastern Upper Michigan, lower Michigan, Indiana,

<TEXT>
   More than 400 ethnic Albanian
teen-agers were hospitalized Thursday in Podujevo, a town in
restive Kosovo province, after being felled by a mysterious illness
that officials said may be poison.
   Official Radio Belgrade said about 4,000 ethnic Albanians
gathered in the streets of Podujevo upon hearing the news. Some of
them beat up 15 Serbs and Montenegrins, accusing them of poisoning
classrooms of Albanian pupils.
   Professor Aljus Gasi, the dean of Pristina University, said he
was informed that 417 schoolchildren were taken to hospitals,
mostly in Pristina, the capital of the ethnically divided province.
   Gasi said doctors who examined the most serious cases reported
such symptoms as reddened eyes and breathing problems.
   An anticipated official statement from authorities was never
released Thursday.
   Radio Belgrade said angry Albanians broke into the local town
council, shattering windows and rampaging through offices.
   Police moved in Thursday to head off an open nationalist
conflict in the streets of Podujevo, considered a center of
Albanian protest in the past.
   The state news agency Tanjug said authorities denied rumors that
drinking water had also been poisoned in the province, where 85
percent of the population are ethnic Albanians.
   It said the provincial government was in session, but had not
issued a statement to explain the suspected poisoning.
   A medical team from Belgrade was on its way to Kosovo to take
blood and other samples for laboratory tests to be made back in
Belgrade, it added.
   ``My daughter who goes to school in Pristina phoned me to say
her school was closed Thursday after pupils complained about signs
of poisoning,'' one woman told The Associated Press. She refused to
give her name.
   A teacher in Podujevo, Agron Jaha, said she saw people
``dropping on the floor en masse.''
   Students were reported hospitalized in Pristina in addition to
Podujevo. Symptoms included nausea, coughing and tearing eyes,
usually ascribed to the effects of tear gas.
   Tanjug and a health worker reported earlier that more than 200
people were hospitalized in Pristina. Most of the patients were
said to be in fair condition.
   The provincial premier, Jusuf Zeinulahu, told reporters none of
the people hospitalized was dangerously ill.
   A crowd of worried parents gathered in front of the Kosovo
government building in Pristina on Thursday.
   Ethnic unrest in Kosovo has killed at least 60 people the last
two years. The unrest centers on a dispute between ethnic
Albanians, who form 90 percent of the population, and the minority
Serbs and Montenegrins.
   The republic of Serbia passed constitutional changes last year
to retain greater control over Kosovo, saying this was needed to
protect the rights of the minorities.
   Opposition sources alleged that chemicals were sprinkled on the
floors of classrooms of ethnic Albanian children or sprayed into
the air.
   Veton Suroi, an opposition leader, told reporters in Pristina
the situation was ``alarming.'' He claimed that more than 1,000
people, mostly children, had been hospitalized in Pristina alone.
   Zekerija Cana, another opposition spokesman, demanded a federal
commission be set up to investigate the circumstances of ``the mass
poisoning by an unknown chemical.''
   They said the alleged poisoning had begun three days ago.

   A few blocks up the street from the
state courthouse, Blacky Arbid sat back from the bar at the Pioneer
Club and came up with a verdict of his own for former tanker
skipper Joseph Hazelwood.
   ``He was responsible for that ship and that's all there was to
it,'' Arbid said, as the television set overheard played re-runs of
Thursday verdict, clearing Hazelwood on all but one misdemeanor
count in the nation's worst spill.
   The jury verdict on the former Exxon Valdez captain was in, but
the trial by public opinion in bars, barbershops, shopping malls
and donut stands continued around town.
   Housewife Peggy Robinson laughed when she heard that the longest
sentence Hazelwood could get is 90 days in jail.
   ``I think it's a farce,'' Robinson said at the Northway shopping
mall.
   ``I feel he messed up a beautiful playground, and then _ poof _
he ran and hid. He couldn't face what he did.''
   Opinion at the Pioneer Club bar was more in line with the jury's
decision.
   There was scattered applause in the court room when Hazelwood
was acquitted of one felony and two misdemeanors, including
operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Jurors found him guilty of negligently discharging oil in
wildlife-rich Prince William Sound.
   ``Geez, I could be convicted of that every day considering the
car I drive,'' bartender Jack Doty said.
   ``No one would say Hazelwood's a great guy, but they over-did
it. More people around here feel it was Exxon, the Coast Guard, the
state _ it was a combination of all them,'' Doty said.
   ``I find myself feeling very sorry for him,'' patron Lorena
Stoklosa said.
   ``A misdemeanor is as much as he deserved,'' said Vince
Kelleher, who says he scrubbed Prince William Sound rocks last
summer as an Exxon seasonal worker.
   ``For the rest of his life, he'll find it tough to find a job
he's trained for. He's paying the penalty.''
   A few doors up the street, at Gordon Bort's Richmond Barber
Shop, men waiting for haircuts were understanding.
   ``He shouldn't have been drinking at all,'' Bort said, as he
snipped a customer's hair. ``But since Exxon knew, they should have
been up on it.''
   Chatting over their afternoon donuts and coffee at the shopping
mall, four retired women debated the verdict.
   ``I hated him and I'm the only one sitting here who does,'' said
Bess Crawford, a retired clerical worker. ``He was the captain.
Twelve hours later, he still had alcohol in him. When you're
responsible for something, you're responsible all the way.''
   ``I knew he was gonna get off from the beginning,'' Catherine
Brodhead said. ``He wasn't guilty. He wasn't even driving the boat
when it happened.''
   Eighteen-year-old Jean Walton was behind the mall's ice cream
counter. The former cannery worker from the coastal town of
Soldotna said Hazelwood deserved stiffer punishment.
   ``They messed up a lot of the fishermen. Exxon didn't even come
close to covering what they did,'' she said.
   ``I hope they throw the book at the oil companies,'' said
optical shop manager Beverly Gilfillan. ``I thought Hazelwood was a
scapegoat.''

<TEXT>
   In a move that could speed formation of East
Germany's first non-Communist government, the Social Democrats
agreed Thursday to discuss joining a coalition government with an
alliance that won national elections.
   The left-leaning party, which finished second in Sunday's
balloting to the Alliance for Germany, refused to work with a
right-wing party in the three-party Alliance. Alliance leaders left
the door open to such an arrangement.
   As the political jockeying continued, the parliament's future
was clouded by concerns that many newly elected lawmakers may have
helped the hated former secret police, Stasi. Those under suspicion
include the man expected to be named as prime minister, Lothar de
Maiziere, chief of the Christian Democrats.
   He denied on Thursday ever having been a secret police
collaborator.
   The official supervising the dismantling of the secret police,
Werner Fischer, said Wednesday that many of the new deputies may
have had clandestine police links.
   Manfred Stolpe, a respected figure in East Germany and chief
administator of the Lutheran church's Berlin district, urged that
all parties agree to an investigation into the 400 newly elected
lawmakers' past.
   He raised the possibility such a probe could lead to new
elections, saying, ``I can imagine that such a decision could
become necessary as a last resort.''
   Fischer on Thursday cited continuing suspicions that de Maiziere
collaborated.
   ``There are indications. There is no proof,'' he told West
Germany's ZDF television.
   He said he had received allegations against de Maiziere from
citizens' groups sifting through secret police files in East German
cities. Asked on television whether he took these allegations
seriously, Fischer said, ``Very.''
   On Thursday, De Maiziere denied a West German newspaper report,
which cited an anonymous tip to pro-democracy groups as saying de
Maiziere was a collaborator with Honecker's secret police.
   De Maiziere said he only had contacts with them on behalf of
dissidents he defended when he was practicing law.
   Berlin Bishop Gottfried Forck warned against rash accusations in
trying to uncover suspected Stasi collaborators. In an interview,
he said he believed de Maiziere's denial.
   The Communists used the Stasi to control all walks of life, and
many people were intidimated into collaborating. Until the
caretaker government began dissolving it this year, the Stasi had
85,000 agents and hundreds of thousands of informers.
   The Social Democrats' decision Thursday was vital because a
two-thirds majority in the new Parliament is needed to approve
unification with West Germany, and the Alliance needs the votes of
the Social Democrats to achieve that majority.
   The Social Democrats favor a more gradual path toward
unification with West Germany than the Alliance, and earlier in the
week it rejected an invitation to discuss forming a broad coalition.
   But on Thursday, the party said it decided to hold exploratory
talks ``in view of the serious problems of our country.''
   ``The (nation's) governability has to have priority,'' Richard
Schroeder, a Social Democratic member in Parliament, told a news
conference. Party officials said meetings with the Alliance would
not begin before Monday.
   The Christian Democratic Union is the largest party in the
Alliance. It won 164 seats in the 400-member Parliament. The Social
Democrats have 87, and together the two parties would have an
absolute majority.
   East Germany's Communist-led caretaker government formally
remains in power until the new democratically elected Cabinet is
formed. Before that happens, West Germany will not resume talks on
unity.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who heavily backs the
Christian Democratic Union, is pressing for a broad coalition in
East Germany to ensure a clear mandate for moves toward unification.
   The Social Democrats ruled out talks with the German Social
Union, the most rightist member of the Alliance of Germany.
   That obstacle appeared to wane somewhat after de Maiziere and
other Alliance leaders met Kohl late Wednesday in Bonn.
   The East German leaders said their parties will not form a
common bloc of deputies. This was seen as a formula that would
allow the Social Democrats to join in a coalition without formally
having to cooperate with the German Social Union.
   The daily number of East Germans resettling in West Germany has
dropped in half the past week, apparently as a result of national
elections, the West German Interior Ministry said Thursday.
   It said 931 East German resettlers registered with federal
authorities on Wednesday, compared with 2,248 one week ago.
   The exodus sparked the fall pro-democracy revolution that ousted
the hard-line Communist regime of Erich Honecker and led to the
election _ East Germany's first free vote.

   A Greyhound Lines negotiator will meet with a
federal mediator in Washington on Friday as new incidents of
violence were reported in the 3-week-old nationwide bus drivers'
strike.
   Company spokesman George Gravley said Thursday that the mediator
in the stalled contract talks called Greyhound's chief negotiator,
Anthony P. Lanney, to Washington. No new talks are scheduled
between management and union.
   Federal mediators are trying to reopen negotiations or to
arrange ``shuttle diplomacy'' between the sides, said Jim Power,
spokesman for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
Renewed violence ``is certainly giving the effort a little more
pressure,'' Powers said.
   ``It doesn't provide a sound basis for getting together. They
need some level ground to work on. (Violence) is always
counterproductive,'' he said.
   Jeff Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgmated Council of Greyhound
Local Unions, said he had no knowledge of discussions between union
officials and federal mediators.
   But Nelson called the meeting between the company and the
mediator ``a first step. Maybe they'll find it in their hearts to
talk to their employees soon.
   ``We are absolutely ready to meet at any time,'' he added.
   The meeting comes against a backdrop of more violence aimed at
Greyhound buses, including the first in Texas. That happened
overnight Wednesday when a bullet was fired at a bus carrying 30
people in San Antonio.
   The bullet struck but did not penetrate a service door on an
entrance ramp to Interstate 35. No one was injured and the bus
continued on to Dallas, Travis County sheriff's officials said.
   ``It did not penetrate the second window of the double window,''
sheriffs Lt. George Meek said. ``It left a hole in one pane but not
the second, because it contains thick insulated plastic.''
   A second Dallas-bound bus, from New Orleans, was struck in its
rear air filter by a bullet Thursday afternoon 15 miles east of
Lake Charles, La., on Interstate 10, company spokeswoman Jean Fry
said. No passengers were aboard, she said. The driver heard a loud
sound and drove to the Lake Charles terminal, Ms. Fry said.
   Early Thursday, there were two shootings reported near St.
Louis. In the first, a bus from St. Louis to Memphis was hit by
three bullets that struck the windshield and the front grill,
police said. The incident occurred on Interstate 55 about a mile
south of the St. Louis city limits.
   The second shooting, about 2:35 a.m., occurred in Illinois about
five miles east of St. Louis and involved a bus that was en route
from Chicago to St. Louis.
   In both cases, the shots seemed to come from a passing car.
   No one was injured in the shootings, police said. But in Las
Vegas, police said an elderly passenger was slightly injured by
flying glass Wednesday when a Greyhound bus en route to Los Angeles
was pelted by rocks on Interstate 15, west of the Las Vegas Strip,
on Wednesday.
   The shootings bring the total to 20 since the strike began March
2, according to a Greyhound accounting released Thursday. The
report added in the three latest shootings in addition to three
earlier incidents that Greyhound said hadn't been reported earlier.
   Union leaders have said they have no reponsibility for the
shootings. They released their own list Thursday, saying 55 pickets
have been injured over the three weeks by being struck by buses,
hit by security guards, or in other incidents.
   One striker was killed the second day of the strike when he was
hit while on a picket line by a bus drive by a replacement driver;
no charges have been filed.
   Gravley said the violence pushes Greyhound away from reopening
talks, which the company halted Sunday in Tucson, Ariz. ``It's
impossible to reach an agreement while this violence and terrorism
is going on,'' Gravley said Thursday.
   Nelson, the union spokesman, said his organization issued
letters Wednesday afternoon asking members to refrain from violence.
   ``Whoever has committed these crimes should know that the union
will support prosecution to the fullest extent of the law,'' Nelson
said. ``These are extremely unfortunate incidents.''
   Nelson said the idea that violent acts have tacit approval from
union leaders is ``absolutely ridiculous.''

   Children suffering from cancer gave gifts to
former President Ronald Reagan on Thursday for his help in raising
funds for a cancer research institute, and he briefly discussed his
former aide's Iran-Contra trial.
   Ashley Fitzgerald, 5, and Julie Green, 15, both cancer patients,
gave Reagan a glass sculpture and a baseball cap for his work for
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute's Jimmy Fund.
   Young cancer patients in the institute's Jimmy Fund wing also
gave the former president a poster bearing all names.
   ``I was able to tell them it's going to be hung in the
presidential library,'' Reagan told reporters.
   After the brief presentation, Reagan answered reporters'
questions about the trial of John Poindexter, his former national
security advisor.
   On Wednesday, the judge in Poindexter's trial ruled that Reagan
did not have to turn over portions of his personal diaries as
evidence in the case because of executive privilege.
   ``I think what we had to do was preserve a tradition,'' Reagan
said, adding that taking away executive privilege might ``invade''
the presidency.
   Reagan also commented on his lack of memory about some events,
as displayed in his videotaped testimony shown to the jury
Wednesday at Poindexter's trial in Washington.
   ``I had to say `I don't remember' so many times,'' he said,
adding that in his eight years in office he had meet over 400 heads
of state and attended numerous meetings and events.
   ``How do you go back and remember who you met on a certain
day?'' Reagan asked.

   A prosecutor in the fraud trial of Imelda Marcos
complained to the judge Thursday that interviews given by her
attorney to reporters could jeopardize the government's case.
   ``The fair administration of justice is threatened by defense
tactics that run afoul of the criminal rules _ as is the
government's right to a fair trial,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra
Livingston said in a letter to U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan.
   The interviews Livingston referred to were excerpts from an NBC
``Today Show'' broadcast Tuesday and comments made to several
newspapers before the trial started.
   Livingston gave Keenan the letter during a break in jury
selection, now in its third day, and the judge took it under
advisement. By the end of the day Thursday, Keenan had selected 31
potential jurors; a final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is
expected to be chosen next week.
   The letter said Gerry Spence, one of the former Philippine first
lady's four attorneys, violated a local rule that prohibits lawyers
from commenting on pending criminal cases, except to deny the
charges or to quote from documents filed with the court.
   Later in the day Thursday, Keenan jokingly brought up the issue.
``You're not going to be on `60 Minutes' again?'' he asked Spence,
who was profiled on the CBS news show several years ago.
   ``It depends on what you're going to do to me,'' Spence said.
   Livingston stopped short of requesting a gag order barring any
discussion of the case. She asked Keenan to remind defense lawyers
of their responsibility to abide by the rule.
   Spence had no immediate comment on the government's letter. On
Wednesday, he told Keenan that he was concerned about negative
publicity.
   ``In this country and in this legal system one doesn't become a
criminal by sleeping with one's husband,'' Spence was quoted as
saying on NBC. ``The ghost of Ferdinand Marcos is everywhere,
everywhere in this case.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged in the alleged illegal transfer of
more than $160 million from the Philippine government and
defrauding banking institutions of an additional $165 million. Her
husband, former Philippine president, was named in the original
October 1988 indictment, but died in Hawaii last Sept. 28.
   Also on trial is Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who is accused
of helping the Marcoses conceal a series of New York real estate
deals allegedly financed in part with money stolen from the
Philippine treasury.

   The state airline Malev asked Aeroflot,
the Soviet air carrier, on Thursday to stop flying Jewish emigres
to Hungary, the MTI news agency reported.
   The request followed Malev's decision Wednesday to suspend
flights of Soviet Jews to Israel via Budapest because of a
terrorist threat.
   The pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine issued the threat this month in Lebanon, saying, ``All
airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines, their
jetliners and offices, will be direct targets for us.''
   ``This is a warning and a threat,'' said the group, which holds
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Many Arab governments have opposed the emigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel on the grounds some of them might settle in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the
territories, which it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East War.
   In New York, the American Jewish Committee asked Hungary to
reverse the airline's decision. In a statement Thursday, the
committee said only 1 percent of arriving Soviet Jews had settled
in the occupied lands.
   The group said, ``Such arguments only serve as smokescreens for
a long-standing and much larger Arab aim: to prevent large-scale
Jewish immigration to any part of Israel.''
   Budapest's Ferihegy aiport, which tightened security to
unprecedented levels in response to the threat, is a transit point
for many Soviet Jews traveling from Moscow. There are no direct
flights from the Soviet Union to Israel. Malev began flying to
Israel last year in the wake of renewed diplomatic ties.
   Despite suspension of charter flights for the Soviet emigrants,
the official MTI news agency said tourist flights would continue.

   President Corazon Aquino on Thursday
dismissed an offer by former first lady Imelda Marcos to return
wealth left by her late husband, saying it was a ruse to escape
trial on U.S. racketeering charges.
   ``I am not convinced of the seriousness, nor of the sincerity
behind this reported latest proposal of Mrs. Marcos, coming as it
does, at the start of the trial in New York,'' Mrs. Aquino said in
a statement to reporters.
   ``The Filipino people want the money that Marcos stole returned
to them directly, and without onerous conditions.''
   Mrs. Marcos went on trial Tuesday in New York, charged with
illegally diverting $160 million to buy property in Manhattan and
defrauding banking institutions of an additional $165 million to
finance the deal. Her husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos of
the Philippines, was named in the original October 1988 indictment,
but he died in Hawaii on Sept. 28.
   In New York, the Philippine government released the text of a
letter Wednesday from Mrs. Marcos to President Bush offering to
turn over money to a five-member international panel which would
oversee its transfer to the Filipino people.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Bush
received a letter from Mrs. Marcos but gave no details of the
amount of money involved. He said the president could not respond
during the trial.
   In Manila, Solicitor General Francisco Chavez also dismissed
Mrs. Marcos' letter as a maneuver by her attorneys.
   ``It seems to be part of the strategy adapted by her lawyer to
picture her as a poor, suffering widow who did not know what her
husband did when he was alive,'' Chavez said.
   ``But all of us know this is ludicrous. This is preposterous
because our records show that she was very well within the circle
that decided the fate of this country during that time.''
   In a related development, Emmanuel Pelaez, the Philippine
ambassador to Washington, denied that the issue of U.S. bases in
the Philippines played any part in Mrs. Marcos' trial.
   ``The United States has never attempted to use the Marcos
prosecution to influence the Philippines on the bases question, nor
has the Philippines ever interfered with or tried to influence the
prosecution of the Marcoses under U.S. laws,'' Pelaez said in a
statement released in Manila.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base
and four smaller facilities under the agreement that expires next
year. Preliminary negotiations for an extension of the bases are
set to begin by the middle of next month.
   Marcos supporters claim the United States is prosecuting Mrs.
Marcos to win favor with the Aquino government so that it will
agree to allow the bases to remain.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's candidate was
trounced Friday in a by-election in central England, losing the
Conservative Party stronghold to an opposition socialist by a
surprisingly wide margin.
   The result marked the Conservatives' worst rout in a special
parlimantary election in 50 years and was likely to fuel
speculation that the Tories might try to dump Mrs. Thatcher as
leader this fall.
   The Labor Party captured the prosperous Mid-Staffordshire
district with a 9,449-vote majority, overturning a majority of more
than 14,000 votes held by the previous Conservative Party
legislator.
   The result, declared early Friday, reflected anger among voters
at soaring 15 percent interest rates that have hiked the cost of
home loans and an unpopular new local government tax.
   Labor candidate Sylvia Heal, a social worker, took 49 percent of
the vote, way ahead of the 33 percent for the Conservative
contender, accountant Charles Prior. The centrist Social and
Liberal Democratic Party's Tim Jones trailed with 11 percent.
   Television networks earlier reported two exit polls conducted by
Harris and National Opinion Poll as showing a large swing of more
than 20 percent from the government to Labor, something
Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker called, ``disappointing.''
   ``Clearly we are going through a period of unpopularity. I think
it will be temporary,'' Baker said. ``The Labor Party is tonight
the passive beneficiary of the protest vote.''
   ``People are absolutely fed up with Mrs. Thatcher,'' declared
Labor Party spokesman Jack Cunningham. ``She is out of touch, she
doesn't seem to understand their problems ... and she doesn't seem
to care.''
   Underlining the bad news for the Tories, a British Broadcasting
Corp. survey Thursday night of the four most recent opinion polls
across the country showed Labor averaging a 21-point lead
nationally. This was Labor's biggest lead since Mrs. Thatcher won a
third successive term in 1987.
   A year ago, the Tories had a 10-point lead nationally.
   From Mid-Staffordshire, pollsters reported an underlying
antipathy toward Mrs. Thatcher personally among many of the people
questioned right after they voted in the prosperous, semi-rural
district.
   Harris reported that 84 percent of defecting Conservatives said
Mrs. Thatcher should resign before the next general election, which
must be held by mid-1992. Among defectors questioned by the
National Opinion Poll, 38 percent said she should quit.
   Harris' exit poll for Independent Television News at the 10 p.m.
close of voting showed Labor winning 50 percent of the vote with
the Conservatives getting 32 percent and the centrist Social and
Liberal Democratic Party 11 percent. ITN said Harris questioned
2,369 people.
   The National Opinion Poll of nearly 2,300 voters for the BBC
showed Labor with 51 percent, the Conservatives 32 percent and the
centrists 10 percent. The margin of error was 3 percent.
   The polls showed the remainder of the vote scattered among the
Greens, a centrist splinter group, the Social Democratic Party, and
nine fringe candidates.
   The election seat became vacant by the suicide in December of
the Conservative politician who took 50 percent of the vote to win
with a 14,654-vote majority in the 1987 general election.
   Thatcher aides argued that by-elections traditionally attract
large protest votes.
   However, the vote was likely to be regarded as a barometer of
her chances of winning the next general election and a trouncing
would renew speculation of a possible attempt to dump her as party
leader this fall.
   Mid-Staffordshire runs from the affluent cathedral town of
Lichfield, birthplace of the 18th century poet and dictionary
compiler Samuel Johnson, through an industrial town, Rugeley.
   The voters include a high proportion of skilled blue-collar
workers who voted Tory through the '80s, followed Mrs. Thatcher's
exhortations to buy their own homes and are now hard-hit by high
home loan rates.
   Interest rates have doubled in under two years in an attempt to
curb inflation, now running at 7.7 percent and rising.
   In addition, Mid-Staffordshire voted while there's a national
furor over the new per-head tax, dubbed the poll tax that next
month replaces property taxes under a reform of local government
financing.
   The tax, which Mrs. Thatcher says is fairer because everyone
pays, is averaging $580 a year and means most families pay about
one-third more.
   The election had no effect on Mrs. Thatcher's overwhelming
control of the 650-member House of Commons, where she has a
101-seat majority. Going into the vote, the Conservatives had 374
seats, compared with Labor's 228, and the Social and Liberal
Democrats' 19. The remainder are held by minority parties.

   A young man reached out as if to welcome
a presidential candidate Thursday and shot him to death with a
submachine gun hidden in a newspaper. Police said a notorious drug
lord ordered the assassination.
   Colombia's intellegence police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez,
said an investigation had determined that the leader of the
Medellin drug cartel, Pablo Escobar, ordered the assassination of
Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union Party.
   An official communique from the National Security Council said
the police had intercepted radio communications between Escobar and
one of his subordinates implicating the drug boss in the killing
early Thursday at Bogota's El Dorado International Airport.
   Earlier Thursday, a telephone caller claimed the attack for the
Medellin cartel.
   Bodyguards with Jaramillo shot and wounded the gunman before he
was captured. At least two other people were reported wounded.
   ``A man walked up to him to greet him like a supporter and then
began shooting,'' one of the bodyguards told Caracol radio, which
also reported Maza Marquez's statement. ``Bernardo fell to the
floor and was protected by his wife and bodyguards while we fired
on the aggressor.''
   Maza Marquez said Escobar's order was confirmed by the gunman
during interrogations. The gunman said he was paid $625 to kill
Jaramillo.
   The police chief, who has been targeted by the cartel in two
bombings, said the assassin was a 16-year-old boy who carried false
identification papers. Police earlier said the assailant was a
21-year-old.
   The gunman fired on Jaramillo after the candidate and his wife
arrived at the airport Thursday morning for an Avianca flight to
the tourist city of Santa Marta on Colombia's north coast,
officials said.
   Jaramillo was hit four times, twice in the throat and twice in
the abdomen, and died later at a hospital, officials said.
   Caracol's Bogota station received a telephone call from a man
who said the Medellin cocaine cartel had slain the 38-year-old
candidate, who was to run in the May 27 election.
   The caller said four gunmen were involved and that three escaped.
   He said another presidential candidate, Cesar Gaviria of the
Liberal Party, would be assassinated next. Maza Marquez said the
captured gunman told police other politicians were on the drug
cartel's hit list.
   Drug traffickers in August killed another presidential hopeful,
Luis Carlos Galan of the governing Liberal Party. That killing
sparked a government crackdown on drug lords and the extradition of
14 drug suspects to the United States.
   Late Thursday, President Virgilio Barco said in a letter to
Patriotic Union president Diego Montana that in light of the ``new
offensive by the violent ones,'' the party should join the
country's efforts to defend democracy.
   On Jan. 18, the Medellin cartel said in a communique that the
government had won its war with the cartel and appealed for an end
to extraditing suspects to the United States.
   The caller Thursday said it was renewing the war because Barco
would not accept an offer for the traffickers to give themselves up
to be tried in Colombian courts.
   Right-wing death squads also have been blamed for previous
slayings of Patriotic Union members. Authorities say some of them
are be run by drug traffickers. The Patriotic Union, though, has
claimed that Colombia's army and police are involved in the death
squads.
   The government permitted the Communist Party and former
guerrillas to organize the Patriotic Union in 1984 to persuade
rebel groups to end three decades of violence.
   The party on Thursday said Interior Minister Carlos Lemos
Simmonds had caused the latest killing with a statement last week,
and it called for him to resign.
   Lemos had accused the Patriotic Union of acting as the political
arm of the country's largest guerrilla group, the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   A submachine gun attack by four men in the Bogota airport's main
terminal on March 3, 1989, killed a member of the executive
committee of the Patriotic Union and wounded a Liberal Party
presidential candidate, Ernesto Samper.
   Americas Watch, a human rights group based in New York, said
Thursday that such attacks in the past had been mounted by both
drug groups and paramilitary organizations supported by army
officers.
   ``Mr. Jaramillo's murder highlights the fact that the targetting
of the Patriotic Union and other leftist organizations ... has nver
stopped in Colombia, even though international attention continues
to be focused on the violent acts of the drug cartels against ...
public officials,'' said Juan Mendez, Americas Watch executive
director.
   As word spread of Jaramillo's death, disturbances flared in
downtown Bogota. People burned a bus and shattered windows of a few
stores. The Patriotic Union called for a national strike.
   The body of Jaramillo was taken to the national Capitol building
while police reported several battles between people throwing rocks
and security forces firing tear gas in the streets of Bogota.
   An official communique said one police officer was shot and
wounded by one protester before riot police restored order.
   At the State Department in Washington, deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said, ``The killing is yet another outrageous assault
against the democratic aspirations of the Colombian people, and we
condemn those who would attempt to force political change through
violent acts such as this.''
   Jaramillo was the 1,044th member of the Patriotic Union Party to
be killed in the last six years. He resigned as president of the
Patriotic Union in February 1989 and fled the country, citing death
threats, but returned six weeks later.
   Drug traffickers have killed more than 200 people in bombings
and other attacks since the Barco government began cracking down on
drug lords after Galan's slaying.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev stepped up his war
of nerves with Lithuania by demanding the surrender of all
firearms, but the breakaway republic's leaders said they were not
intimidated and would not bend.
   President Vytautus Landsbergis of Lithuania, which declared
itself independent on March 11, said in a statement that the Soviet
leader's Wednesday decree showed ``the ghost of Stalinism is
walking in the Kremlin.''
   Landsbergis said the Baltic republic would remain ``serene and

by brutal military force.''
   Gorbachev has called Lithuania's declaration of independence
illegal but has also said he would not use force to keep it from

   Senate Democrats are outlining a new $2
billion aid package for Eastern Europe _ far more than President
Bush wants to spend and several times what Democrats themselves
proposed just two months ago.
   The draft bill escalates a Democratic argument that Bush has
been too timid in aiding the emerging democracies and establishing
a foothold for U.S. companies in their newly free economies.
   The bill by Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Joseph R. Biden,
D-Del., includes a $1.2 billion U.S. share in a European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, proposed by France to finance
public works and new private enterprises in former communist
economies.
   A copy of the draft was obtained Wednesday by The Associated
Press.

   The Bush administration is moving swiftly to
appeal a judge's order that threatens a costly delay in the
president's savings and loan bailout.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth barred the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision on Wednesday from seizing
Olympic Savings and Loan Association of Berwyn, Ill.
   Lamberth said thrift office director Salvatore R. Martoche and
his predecessor, M. Danny Wall, were unconstitutionally appointed.
He said the government may not seize the suburban Chicago thrift
until a new director is nominated by President Bush and confirmed
by the Senate.
   The judge rejected a last-minute plea from government attorneys
to stay his order. They said they would ask the U.S. Court of
Appeals to overturn it.

   Households across the nation will receive
census forms in the mail starting Friday, as the head count shifts
its focus from the homeless to the rest of the U.S. population.
   The most ambitious effort ever to count the homeless wound up
early Wednesday, with Census Bureau Director Barbara Everett Bryant
proclaiming success.
   ``We can now move on to the rest of America,'' she said, urging
people to complete their census forms and send them back promptly.
   Nearly 85 million census forms already have been trucked to bulk
distribution centers of the U.S. Postal Service. They will go into
the hands of letter carriers Friday for delivery to homes
nationwide.

   The Senate is approaching a showdown over
whether to provide aid to coal miners who lose their jobs because
of new pollution controls, and the outcome could determine whether
a clean air bill passes this year.
   The coal issue has placed two of the Senate's most powerful
members at odds: Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was Mitchell's predecessor as Senate
leader and still wields immense power as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
   Byrd has been pressing an assistance program for miners in his
state and elsewhere if they lose their jobs because of tougher acid
rain controls at coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.
   On Wednesday night, he offered to lower the package's expected
cost from $700 million over four years to $500 million over three
years.

   President Bush says he still won't eat his
broccoli and not even his ``totalitarian'' wife can make him.
   Bush expressed delight Wednesday that California growers were
shipping 10 tons of the green vegetable to feed the hungry in the
nation's capital.
   ``I am not going to rethink my position,'' a puckish president
insisted on his way home from the Oval Office.
   Barbara Bush has publicly bemoaned the difficulty of getting her
husband to eat his vegetables, but Bush said later he didn't really
ban broccoli from the presidential plane.

<HEAD>Tamil Women Guerrillas Moving Into the Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TINNELVELI, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women guerrillas of the Tamil
Tigers, cyanide capsules around their necks and assault rifles
ready, have moved out of the jungles and into the towns since
Indian peacekeeping troops went home.
   The emergence of the Tiger women, who were talked about often
but seldom seen, is jolting society in the Jaffna Peninsula of
northern Sri Lanka, where the Tamil minority predominates.
   Violence has been a way of life here since the revolt by Tamil
separatists began in 1983, but warfare was considered men's work.
   ``Our social fabric and lifestyle have been completely
destroyed,'' said Velupillai Kanapathipillai, a Tamil
schoolteacher. ``It will never be the same after seeing these young
girls carrying guns.''
   Kanapathipillai was echoing traditional beliefs that Tamil women
should be demure.
   Lt. Imelda, a 26-year-old commander of the Female Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, has little time for that. She and the other women in
her outfit can handle T-81 Chinese assault rifles and machine
pistols, rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns, she said.
   Stanley Dominic, district leader of the male Tigers, spoke with
pride of the women.
   ``They do everything we do,'' he told an interviewer in Jaffna.
``They man checkpoints 24 hours. They drive heavy trucks captured
from the Indian army. They take part in active combat, and they are
willing to bite their cyanide capsules to avoid being captured.''
   The Tigers say more than 300 of their men have used cyanide to
commit suicide rather than submit to capture and interrogation.
Imelda said she did not know how many women Tigers had used their
capsules.
   About 25 Tiger women in camouflage gear guarded her two-story
headquarters during a recent visit. The women are segregated from
the male Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest guerrilla
force, which has fought both the Sri Lankan army and Indian
peacekeeping troops.
   No men were in sight at the headquarters, and a male visitor was
eyed with suspicion.
   Imelda, who uses a code name like many male Tigers, said 26
women guerrillas died in face-to-face combat with male Indian
soldiers in two years.
   She denied periodic speculation that the female Tigers were
created to fight Indian paramilitary policewomen who served in Sri
Lanka along with the all-male Indian army.
   ``No Indian woman soldier can fight me,'' Imelda said, eyes
blazing. ``They are powder puffs. I challenge them.''
   Neither male nor female Tigers will give the total strength of
the guerrillas, who seek a separate homeland in northeastern Sri
Lanka to be called Tamil Eelam. The militants claim discrimination
by Sri Lanka's ethnic Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese, 75 percent of the 16 million people, control the
government and army of this island off the tip of India. Tamils
make up 18 percent of the population.
   More than 11,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
ethnic war.
   In 1989, the Tamil Tigers began negotations with the Sri Lankan
government on a peaceful solution. As Indian troops withdrew, the
Tigers took over positions and whole towns once patrolled by the
peacekeepers, with no serious opposition from the Sri Lankan
military.
   Male guerrillas patrol Jaffna town, but many residents speak
with awe of the female Tigers, who occasionally are seen in the
town and nearby villages.
   Imelda said the women Tigers, like their male counterparts, have
a strict code of conduct.
   ``We are not permitted to have boyfriends, wear makeup or
jewelry, not even powder our faces,'' she said.
   One of her fighters, 20-year-old Valarmathy, said: ``Women have
been in the forefront of the liberation struggle all over the
world. We are no exception.''
   Like Imelda, Valarmathy would not say when she joined the Tigers
or what she did before.

<HEAD>Ted Koppel Celebrates 10th ``Nightline'' Anniversary, Quietly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anniversaries always are big deals in TV. But
don't expect a gala edition of ABC's ``Nightline'' tonight to note
that it will be 10 years old on Saturday.
   In fact, don't even expect Ted Koppel to anchor it tonight.
   ``As a matter of fact, I`m taking the day off,'' says Koppel,
the show's anchor ever since it premiered as a 20-minute,
Monday-through-Thursday late-night news interview program on March
24, 1980.
   The celebration of a decade will occur in late April with a
prime-time edition of ``Nightline,'' featuring suitable highlights
of its existence.
   The show's honors include two Peabody Awards and general acclaim
for Koppel's crisp, to-the-point interviews of a wide variety of
guests: world leaders, sports executives, diplomats, AIDS victims,
Arabs and Israelis together, generals, and even Gary Hart, a
two-time visitor.
   But his most-watched show concerned what some might call light
entertainment, a chat with the since-fallen TV preacher Jim Bakker
and his wife, Tammy, in May 1987. It got a 41 percent share of the
audience, and viewers in more than 12.3 million homes tuned in.
   True, more cosmic matters tend to draw smaller audiences. The
show averages 5 million to 6 million homes each night, ABC says.
Sometimes it's even lower _ only about 3.9 million homes in the
week ending March 9.
   But ``Nightline,'' the brainchild of ABC News President Roone
Arledge, has proved there is room in late-night TV for news
interviews as an alternative to amusements, and it can get ratings
even on those nights Johnny Carson fills in for his guest hosts.
   ``It's the only show of its kind that time at night _ it's
really the only show of its kind in commercial television,'' says
Koppel, whose program, among other things, has held six world-class
``town meetings.''
   The most recent one, set against the backdrop of the freeing of
black leader Nelson Mandela, took place last month in South Africa.
   What has become ``Nightline'' began on Nov. 8, 1979, with a
different title and as a single-subject effort anchored by the late
Frank Reynolds. Aired four days after 65 Americans were seized at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the show was called ``The Iran Crisis:
America Held Hostage.''
   A week later, through Arledge's efforts, ABC began ``America
Held Hostage,'' a late-night series on the crisis. The show
initially was anchored by Reynolds, then Peter Jennings and finally
Koppel.
   Koppel, with ABC News for 27 of his 50 years, became permanent
anchor of the series two weeks after it began, staying at the helm
as ``Nightline'' premiered and evolved into its half-hour,
five-night format.
   The anchorman, who now gets Monday nights off, became famous and
wealthy. And, in an unusual arrangement nearly three years ago, he
also got a new contract under which his own production company
makes four prime-time ABC specials a year, which he then can sell
overseas.
   Although he and ``Nightline'' generally have enjoyed critical
huzzahs, they have suffered a few shots, too, notably from a media
watchdog group, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.
   FAIR, citing its analysis of ``Nightline'' shows from 1985 to
1988, complained about what it said was the show's preponderance of
white male guests from government, corporations and the military.
   ``The larger question here is ... their perception and analysis
that we had a great many white male conservatives on the program,''
Koppel says.
   ``Well, if you look at the 10 years that `Nightline' has been on
the air, during those years Ronald Reagan was president, George
Bush was president and the policy-makers and decision-makers, the
people they put into power, tend to be white male conservatives.''
   Koppel, whose current ABC contract ends in December, estimates
he and his ``Nightline'' staff work about 13 hours a day on each
show, and a 15-hour day isn't all that unusual.
   But he has no ambitions, he says, to anchor a network newscast.
   ``I'd rather do what I do now,'' he says.
   Nor would he like to shift from what is show-time for him _
11:30 p.m. EST _ to a prime-time news series. Such a series would
give ABC three; it already has the veteran ``20@20'' and fledgling
``PrimeTime Live.''
   But there would be no joy in weekly prime time for Koppel.
   ``I just don't think that a `Nightline'-like program would make
it in prime time,'' he says. ``We would undoubtedly get more
viewers than we get right now at 11:30 at night. But I don't think
we'd get enough more to make it a successful prime-time program.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   OIL AND THE '60s THIS WEEKEND: There'll be another anniversary
Saturday _the first anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska. With that in mind, cable TV's Discovery Channel, which last
Sunday showed ``Black Tide,'' an hour-long documentary on the
spill, is repeating the show late tonight. On Sunday night, Ted
Turner's TBS cable superstation will check in with ``Outrage at
Valdez,'' another documentary on the massive spill.
   On the lighter side, ``The Outsiders,'' a new drama series on
what it was like to grow up in the '60s, gets a 90-minute premiere
Sunday on the Fox network. The young lads in the cast will wear
ducktails, of course. The show's publicity shots make them appear
victims of a massive Brylcreem spill.

   To prosecutors and the families of his
victims, Robert Alton Harris is a vicious murderer who laughed
about killing two teen-agers and told one to ``quit crying and die
like a man.''
   To his lawyers and closest friend, he is the product of a
violently abusive childhood who, during a decade on death row, has
grown into a stable, caring, remorseful man.
   Harris has become a symbol of the public's anger over violent
crime and legal delays in carrying out the state's death penalty
law, but April 3, barring a last-minute stay, he will become the
first person executed in California since 1967.
   Harris, 37, was convicted of abducting and killing two
16-year-old San Diego boys 12 years ago to get their car for a bank
robbery that netted $3,000.
   ``It seems to me if anybody deserves the death penalty, it is
Harris,'' said San Diego County Superior Court Judge Michael
Wellington, who as a state deputy attorney general fought most of
Harris' appeals over the past decade.
   ``Two murders, a pair of kidnappings, a bank robbery by someone
who was six months out on parole from a previous homicide _ the
crime is horrible, inexcusable,'' Wellington said.
   Michael Kroll, a writer and death penalty opponent who
befriended Harris, agrees the crimes are ``horrendous.''
   But he insists the man he has visited weekly for the past eight
years is not the cold-blooded monster drawn by prosecutors and
should be spared the trip to San Quentin's gas chamber.
   Harris has admitted shooting the boys, but said he does not know
why.
   On July 5, 1978, he and his 18-year-old brother, Danny, planned
to rob a branch of the San Diego Trust and Savings Bank, but needed
a getaway car.
   Harris spotted a green Ford in a parking lot; John Mayeski and
his friend Michael Baker sat inside, eating hamburgers from a
nearby fast-food restaurant.
   Harris pulled out a 9mm Luger, climbed into the Ford and ordered
John to drive to a deserted spot. Danny Harris, who followed in the
brothers' car, later testified that Harris told the boys he would
not hurt them and ordered them to walk up a fire trail.
   But Harris shot John in the back and the head, then ran after
Michael, who fled and hid behind a rock, Danny said. When Harris
caught up with him, the boy screamed, prayed and pleaded for his
life.
   ``Quit crying and die like a man,'' Harris later boasted of
telling the teen-ager, a cellmate testified. ``God can't help you
now, boy. You're going to die.''
   Harris shot Michael four times, then shot John again in the head.
   At his girlfriend's apartment, he laughed about the shootings
and ate the boys' unfinished meals, Danny said.
   Among the officers who arrested Harris a short time later was
Steven Baker, Michael's father. Baker, who learned only later his
son was dead, has waited more than a decade to watch Harris'
execution.
   ``They were good boys, doing well in school, they didn't have
any problems, and on that particular day they were going fishing,''
Baker said. ``(And Harris) just executed those boys.''
   In exchange for testifying against his brother, Danny Harris was
not charged with murder but served 3{ years for robbery.
   Harris was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in early
1979, but three previous execution dates were dissolved during the
appeals process.
   ``It's just an open sore that never seems to heal,'' Baker said
of the delays.
   In January, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its fourth consideration
of the case, refused to hear Harris' appeal. On Feb. 5, a San Diego
judge issued a death warrant setting the April 3 execution date.
   On March 16, the state Supreme Court refused to overturn the
death sentence or stay the execution. Harris' lawyers said they
would file another appeal Monday in federal court in San Diego, but
there are few legal issues left to argue.
   Last week, Harris withdrew his request for clemency from Gov.
George Deukmejian, saying he did not think it would get fair
consideration. Deukmejian, a former state attorney general,
advocates capital punishment and wrote California's current death
penalty law.
   Harris' attorneys argue his rights were violated and claim his
progress in prison disproves a prosecution psychiatrist's testimony
depicting him as a ``sociopath'' incapable of remorse or
rehabilitation.
   They also have submitted statements from some of the 273 other
death row inmates praising Harris as well-liked, decent, helpful
and generous.
   ``Unlike most men here, we've seen the changes Robert Harris has
gone through. We've also seen something you won't see on many faces
here _ remorse,'' wrote inmate James A. Melton.
   The Supreme Court petition also offered ``newly discovered''
evidence of mental disorders stemming from childhood abuse.
   Harris, the fifth of nine children, was born in South Carolina
more than two months prematurely when his father kicked his
alcoholic mother, claiming she was carrying another man's child.
   He was beaten daily and dropped on his head several times as a
young child. A sister said in court documents that their father
often threatened them, loading his weapons and warning, ``You have
only 30 minutes to hide.''
   When Harris was 13, after the family had moved to California and
broken up, his mother abandoned him as they picked fruit near
Modesto.
   Two years later, he was arrested in Florida for stealing a car
and spent 4{ years in prison, then settled in Southern California's
Imperial Valley and worked as a welder. His former wife, Cheryl,
later testified he beat her and threaten to kill her if she told
anyone.
   At the time of the murders, Harris had been on parole for six
months after spending almost 2{ years in prison for manslaughter.
   His background does not excuse his crimes, but helps explain
them and makes life in prison a more appropriate penalty, Kroll
said.
   ``If you treat a child in a way totally devoid of love, totally
violent ... you will get pathological violence at the other end,
however it's manifested,'' he said.
   Baker and prosecutors argue that Harris' past was known and
considered at the proper time _ by the jury that recommended a
death sentence.
   ``I believe very strongly that you are responsible for your own
actions,'' Baker said. ``It's become so easy and so common for
people to blame other circumstances.''
   Now Baker waits for prosecutors to call him in San Diego and
tell him to buy a plane ticket for the execution.
   ``I think I''ll feel relieved that the entire ordeal is finally
over,'' he said.

<HEAD>Buick Riviera: Re-Redesign Brings Back the Size _ and the Buyers</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   It doesn't pay to mess with a good thing.
   Take the 1990 Buick Riviera. Save for some modifications of the
instrument panel and more luxurious interior features, the car is
virtually unchanged from its 1989 reincarnation as one of America's
cherished luxury coupes.
   Thank heavens. In the 1986 model year, when Buick shrank the
Riv, sales plunged from 55,546 the previous year to 25,835. By the
1987 model year, sales were down to 19,838, then to 9,241 in 1988.
   The signals were clear: Americans wanted their Riv big and
luxurious.
   The 1990 Riviera is that and more. In fact, the Riviera ranked
as the top domestic car and No. 2 among imports and domestic cars
combined in a study by market researchers J.D. Power and Associates
of Agoura Hills, Calif. The study surveyed buyers of 1989 models
about initial quality of their vehicles.
   For anyone with warm memories of earlier Rivieras, the 1990
model doesn't disappoint.
   Exterior styling retains the traditional Riv look with the
cutoff rear roofline followed by swept-back rear end. It's longer,
by 11 inches, than the previous model.
   It's solid _ doors are heavy and close with a decided thud.
   The interior of the test car exuded traditional luxury. The wide
front seats cradled the body, as did the outer seat areas of the
back seat. Leather (an $895 option) made the test car even more
luxurious. Legroom in back was commendable.
   Three adults could be accommodated in the back seat, and even
the person in the middle had a cushioned resting spot. I liked the
handles that Buick installed on the door pillars next to the small
rear windows _ they made getting out a lot easier.
   Oddly, the two front seats offered distinctly different
perspectives. On the driver's side, the dashboard and instrument
cluster jut out to put the radio and ventilation controls within
easy reach and the instruments close for easy viewing.
   The instruments, by the way, were rather jazzy _ lit up in green
circles in an arrangement that seemed befitting an airplane
cockpit. This was a simpler design from last year's Riviera, which
had an electronic control console that some auto writers criticized
as too complex.
   On the passenger side, however, the dash and glovebox were
pushed back against the windshield, offering a roomy seating area
that made it easy to cross and uncross legs.
   The trunk was wide but had a slightly raised area in the center
where the spare tire is located. The 3.8-liter, fuel-injectd V-6,
coupled with four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, was
nicely responsive and controlled.
   Suspension and handling were not as mushy as you might expect,
thanks in part to the optional Gran touring package ($104) that
added stiffer than normal suspension and Goodyear GT-4 radial
tires. Still, the ride should appeal even to those looking for a
soft ride. The test car also had optional antilock brakes ($925)
that worked well but kicked up quite a fuss on ice.
   As expected in a luxury car, the 1990 Riviera has a host of
standard features such as automatic climate control, which includes
air conditioning, cruise control, AM-FM stereo cassette, and power
steering and brakes.
   I also appreciated the test car's $865 option package that added
a keyless entry system. This niftily lets you lock and unlock the
doors, unlock the trunk and turn on the interior lights from within
10 feet of the car by pushing buttons on a control switch on the
key chain. It saves having to fumble with keys with an armload of
groceries, for instance. The package also includes power seats, a
rear-view mirror that automatically adjusts to headlight glare and
a heated driver-side mirror.
   Buick spokesman Gary Witzenburg said women account for 56
percent of the primary Riviera drivers and 41 percent of the
purchase decision-makers. Riviera buyers have median income of
$60,000 to $65,000 and an average age of 50. Seventy-one percent
are married, and 40 percent have college degrees, he added.
   With the re-redesign of the Riviera in autumn 1988, sales
rebounded to 20,000 in the 1989 model year. And while Buick does
not make projections for specific models in the 1990 model year, it
does look for overall sales of all Buick models to increase 6
percent, Witzenburg said.
   Despite the high quality rating from J.D. Power and Associates
for 1989 Rivieras, earlier models have not fared as well, according
to Consumer Reports magazine. It ranked the smaller, 1986-87
Riviera V-6 models as much worse than average in owner reports of
trouble.
   There were no Consumer Reports listings for the redesigned 1988
or 1989 models.

   A stone's throw from the smelly Smithfield meat
market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to
attract the attention of Londoners hurrying by.
   Mounted cameras, jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the
uninvited. The gold-colored interior is hushed and luxuriously
decorated.
   This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing
arm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy
Oppenheimer family of South Africa. Its experts sort mounds of
rough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the world's annual
production.
   But scratch the surface of this secretive world, and the diamond
business loses some sparkle.
   Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is
facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to
sell more of their own gems.
   Although its prosperity and control of the world diamond
industry looks unchallengeable, the pressures could loosen its grip
and crimp its profits.
   ``This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers,'' says
Diamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.
   De Beers' South African interests face an uncertain future,
largely because of a newly energized political will by the black
majority in that country, an important diamond producer. The
African National Congress has pledged to nationalize South Africa's
major sources of wealth if it takes power.
   Apparently attempting to limit risk, De Beers recently announced
it would split South African and foreign interests into two
publicly held companies, one based in Switzerland.
   After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in
1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year
because of slowing economies, high interest rates and the
organization's two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.
   The decline was sharpest in the second half of the year, when
sales fell 24 percent from the first six months.
   ``There was a very definite, noticeable slack in demand,'' said
analyst Peter Miller of Yorkton Securities Inc. in London.
   The decline has limited De Beers' scope for raising prices. This
past week, De Beers announced it was increasing prices 5.5 percent,
compared to a 15.5 percent increase a year earlier.
   The organization must this year renegotiate five-year contracts
with Botswana, the second biggest diamond producer in terms of
value, and Argyle Diamonds of Western Australia, the biggest
producer in terms of quantity.
   The government of newly independent Namibia, meanwhile, is
expected to demand a one-fifth stake in Consolidated Diamond Mines,
De Beers' Namibian subsidiary.
   The organization sells most of the Soviet Union's West-bound
diamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been
acting more independently and squeezing the cartel's margins, the
experts say.
   Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent
diamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will
continue to control the major part of world production, but its
marketing arm's profits will fall.
   The effect hasn't been felt yet; De Beers' profit rose 37
percent to $1.1 billion in 1989.
   Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside
the organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned
because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.
   Zaire returned in 1983 after a two-year split. Angola, which
broke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry.
   ``We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have
been for many years,'' said Tim Capon, the cartel's director.
   The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers' own mines,
which represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers
in Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and
the Soviet Union.
   It reveals few details about security. It was robbed once, in
the early 1980s, when some diamonds were snatched as couriers
carried them from one building to another.
   De Beers picks its 160 or so buying customers from thousands of
hopefuls. Ten times a year, at sales called ``sights,'' the clients
are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and
placed in a simple cardboard box. The buyer basically can take it
or leave it.
   The gems then go to cutters in the world's major diamond-cutting
centers: Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Antwerp, Belgium; and New
York.
   Of all diamonds mined, only 15 percent will end up in jewelry,
but these represent 80 percent of the value of the world's diamond
production. The rest are put to industrial use.
   The organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by
trying to create new demand. Last year, it spent $160 million on
advertising and promotion, trying, for example, to boost purchases
of men's diamond jewelry.
   De Beers's achievement over the decades has been to mass-market
what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing
its value. Today, diamonds remain ``the gem of gems,'' although
millions of people own them.
   De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for
the industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence
in the value of diamonds.
   So far, it has succeeded. While other commodities markets have
suffered repeated convulsions, rough diamond prices haven't fallen
since the organization started announcing price changes in 1964.
   Even its fiercest competitors laud De Beers for putting up
considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop
mines and support the market.
   During the early 1980s, when high interest rates caused the
worst diamond slump since the 1930s, the organization prevented the
market's collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly $2
billion worth.
   But producers criticize the organization's secretiveness and
what they call its arbitrary valuation system. Some want more of
the industry's millions of jobs relocated in their own countries.
   Said Lunzer: ``It's not unnatural for people in the producing
countries to say, `Are we getting a proper share of the value of
our national resource?''' After reviewing a complaint filed by the
British mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC alleging
anti-competitive practices, Britain's Office of Fair Trading
decided in August against formally investigating whether the
organization abuses its monopoly.
   Gold Fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver
against a hostile, and ultimately unsuccessful, takeover bid from
Oppenheimer-controlled Minorco SA last year.
   Formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and based in
Kimberley, South Africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the
British industrial colonialist Cecil Rhodes.
   Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of
De Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co.,
the precursor of today's cartel.
   Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive
Anglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with
steering De Beers through the Depression. He died in 1957 and was
succeeded by his son, Harry Oppenheimer, who has made the company
more internationally minded and therefore less vulnerable.
   Now 81, Oppenheimer still serves on De Beers' board of
directors, of which he previously was chairman. His 44-year-old son
and heir apparent, Nicholas, is deputy to Chairman Julian Ogilvie
Thompson.

<HEAD>Soviet Jewish Autonomous Region Is Anything But</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIROBIDZHAN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A log cabin is the only place of
Jewish worship in this frozen region once called a promised land
for Soviet Jews. The makeshift rabbi, Boris Kaufman, conducts some
services with the New Testament.
   He says he believes in Jesus Christ. That makes him a Christian,
not a Jew, but few would notice in the Jewish Autonomous Region of
the Soviet Union.
   Little is Jewish but the name in this remote corner of the
Soviet Far East set aside in 1934.
   Kaufman, a 40-year-old preacher with a red beard who settled on
Judaism after trying the Baptist and Pentecostal faiths, said he
got his job by default after the region's only rabbi died a few
years, aged 86.
   ``Everything fell apart'' after the rabbi's death, Kaufman
recalled. He acknowledged having little knowledge of Hebrew, the
language of the Old Testament, and said he interprets Jewish
religious doctrine loosely.
   During Hanukkah, the Feast of Lights, when Jews around the world
lit ceremonial candles and recited holiday prayers, there were no
candles in the Jewish Autonomous Region and no worshipers in the
cabin. Snow-covered street banners bore only secular greetings, for
the New Year.
   The region has no real rabbi or other Jewish clergy, no
religious education or kosher food. No one can remember the last
true Jewish wedding or bar mitzvah, the ritual that marks a boy's
13th birthday.
   As a Western writer put it, decades-old hopes for the Jewish
Autonomous Region were ``blown away by the cold Siberian wind.''
   After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the new leaders broke with
the czarist policy of confining Jews to a section of the southern
and southwestern Russian Empire known as the Pale.
   They gave Jews their own territory, a sparsely populated tract
between the Bira and Bidzhan rivers, a region the size of Belgium
rich in forests, tin deposits and such wildlife as the Siberian
Ussuri tiger and wild boar.
   Most of the Jewish Autononomous Region is farmland. Wooden huts
dot the landscape outside the regional capital, Birobidzhan, a town
of old brick apartment buildings and newer pre-fabricated concrete
dwellings.
   It was an artificial entity prompted by the new government's
nationalities policy and by military strategy. It forms a buffer on
the border with Manchuria.
   Creating the region also served to counter Zionism, the movement
advocating Jewish settlement in Palestine.
   The government hoped large numbers of Jewish farmers and
tradesmen would make the 5,000-mile trek from Moscow and other
Russian cities. In 1935, President Mikhail Kalinin boldly
predicted: ``In 10 years' time, Birobidzhan will become the most
important guardian of the Jewish national culture.''
   Kalinin's hopes were not realized.
   Comparatively few Jews made the trip, and of those who did come
to escape persecution and famine, many soon left. The climate was
harsh _ temperatures reached 13 degrees below zero this winter _
the land was undeveloped and the nation's Jewish centers were a
world away.
   Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky, a Jew who was born Lev Bronstein,
eventually described the experiment as ``a bureaucratic farce.''
The late Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev declared it a failure.
   Jews never became more than a small minority in the region,
despite Lenin's stipulation of uniform nationality in such areas.
The Jewish Autonomous Region has 8,887 Jews, 4 percent of the
region's population and less than one-half of 1 percent of the
Soviet Union's 1.4 million Jews.
   Official propaganda still portrays the region almost as a Jewish
paradise, a showplace of assimilation and a refutation of claims
that Soviet Jews are persecuted.
   In a dispatch in October 1988 about the Russian-born Jewish
writer Sholon Aleichem, the official news agency Tass said that
``Birobidzhan's example clearly shows that the writer's dream of
seeing his people free and happy has come true.''
   Most Jews in the region appear to have assimilated, and to have
succumbed to official atheism.
   Some did not survive Josef Stalin's purge of 1937 and his
campaign against ``Jewish cosmopolitanism'' in 1948. Exhibits in a
section of the Birobidzhan museum say many Jews, including
Americans who came to help work the land, were killed or sent to
labor camps.
   Yiddish schools, a publishing house and a theater were closed.
   Birobidzhan has some appearance of Jewish life, along with
factories that make combines, shoes and electrical transformers.
   Signs on stores and public buildings are in Yiddish, as well as
Russian. The main street is not named after Lenin, as in most
Soviet cities, but for Sholom Aleichem.
   In keeping with government policy of treating Jews as a
nationality, not a religious group, there are some signs of Jewish
culture _ a theater, radio programs in Yiddish, a cultural club and
schools where Yiddish is taught after a 42-year ban. A hotel
restaurant serves pseudo-Jewish cuisine.
   There is virtually nothing religious, although President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has proclaimed official tolerance of religion and
permitted a revival of religious life nationwide.
   Kaufman said few young people are interested in the religion and
he has difficulty assembling the required 10-man quorum for
services.
   He would like to see a religious revival, he said, and hopes a
young man studying in Moscow will become the rabbi in Birobidzhan.
The student has been offered the job, but some Jews in Birobidzhan
said he wasn't interested.
   Local officials, many of them Jews, seem uninterested in
improving religious life.
   Mayor Mark Kaufman, no relation to Boris, acknowledged the
log-cabin synagogue was in bad shape and pledged to improve
conditions for worship. He also called the synagogue a ``part of
Jewish history'' and suggested converting it to a cultural center.
   Arkady Kuperman, ``religion'' correspondent of the
Yiddish-language newspaper, Birobidzhaner Stern, said he saw
nothing wrong with the lack of interest in religion.
   ``We are atheists,'' he said. ``We spent our whole lives without
God, and this doesn't bother me.''
   At Birobidzhan's teacher-training college, opened in October as
part of Gorbachev's liberalization program, there is a Jewish
language and literature department with classes in Yiddish. Hebrew
classes are planned, but not religious instruction.
   ``There are no real believers among us, except for old people,''
said Larisa Tsilman, one of the institute's two young Yiddish
teachers.
   Officials see the region as an alternative destination for
Soviet Jews considering emigration. A few families have applied to
move here because of what they consider an increase of
anti-Semitism elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   Most Soviet Jews wanting to leave, however, continue to choose
Israel or the United States.
   Talk of emigration also increases among Jewish residents of
Birobidzhan.
   Four families went to live abroad last year. Vladimir Okun, 66,
who runs the Birobidzhan chess club and keeps up with the gossip,
predicts all the Jews in the Jewish Autonomous Region will be gone
in five years.

<HEAD>Virginia Governor Pushes Democrats To Identify Political
Mainstream</HEAD>

   Politicians seek the mainstream the way
explorers once went in quest of the fountain of youth, looking for
comparable benefits. Both are supposed to offer rejuvenation and
eternal vigor.
   Neither has yet been located.
   The mainstream is supposed to be the center, where the voters
are, but where that is depends on where you stand. Republican
Nelson A. Rockefeller made the term his trademark a generation ago
as he campaigned long and fruitlessly for the White House, against
conservatives he said were extremists. They said Rockefeller was
the extremist, too liberal by far.
   It remained a matter of Republican debate through years of
liberal-moderate-conservative struggle. The conservatives finally
won, and Ronald Reagan's eight years as president pushed the whole
political establishment toward the right.
   Now it is the Democrats who are debating the whereabouts of the
mainstream. One man who thinks he has located it is freshman Gov.
L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who is urging the national party to
get into ``America's new mainstream ... the force of the future.''
   The Democratic National Committee is trying to find winning ways
at a meeting this weekend while a bloc of party centrists, the
Democratic Leadership Council, searches simultaneously in New
Orleans.
   Those conflicting if not rival meetings _ congressional and
national committee chieftains are shuttling between them _ point to
the difficulties the Democrats face as they seek themes and
messages that will register with the voters. They've lost five out
of six presidential elections, and at this point their prospects
for 1992 don't look good.
   While Wilder is new to the Democrats' national lineup, he may be
a pivotal figure in their effort to change the odds. Wilder, the
first black elected governor of a state, says the people already
have embraced the principles that will be the issues of the future,
and are waiting for their leaders to follow.
   Those principles, he says, are a combination of strong family
values, individual initiative, social conscience and fiscal
responsibility.
   ``America's new mainstream is not Democratic or Republican,
conservative or liberal, right wing or left wing,'' he says in a
speech he is delivering to forums around the country. ``It looks
ahead, not behind. It unites people, rather than pitting them
against each other. It builds, rather than destroys.''
   Wilder urges Democrats to stop fighting with each other,
crippling their presidential nominees before the real campaigns
begin.
   ``We're doing the other party's work for them _ and it must stop
if we are ever again to be more than mere guests at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Wilder said in a Washington speech. ``A
second lesson is equally clear: in presidential elections our
candidates must take the plunge into the waters of America's new
mainstream.''
   In more practical terms, Wilder said Americans want to hold the
line against more government spending and taxes, want tougher
measures against drugs and crime. Those are Republican issues now;
Wilder says he proved in Virginia that Democrats can reclaim them
and win.
   Wilder said in an interview that he is prepared to work actively
for a mainstream Democratic candidate in the campaign for the
party's 1992 presidential nomination.
   That would magnify his role because it means the party's ranking
black office holder could wind up campaigning against Jesse
Jackson, an almost certain bet to make his third bid for the
Democratic nomination.
   The governor doesn't put it that way, saying he would not
campaign against anyone but would work in behalf of a candidate
whose views mesh with those he described. His terms fit other, more
centrist Democrats a lot better than they fit Jackson.
   Jackson's prior campaigns have pushed other Democrats to the
left during the contest for nomination, to positions that became
problems after the ticket was picked. Democrats fear, and
Republicans hope, that will happen again in 1992, when Jackson's
position will be strengthened because California will hold its
primary near the beginning of the campaign in 1992 instead of at
the end. Jackson got 35 percent of the vote there in 1988, enough
to put him at or near the top of the field should there be a
multiple-candidate primary next time.
   So, a scant three months into his four-year term as governor,
Wilder is an important player at the Democratic political table.
   For a politician newly come to office, the standard reply to
talk about a national role is a flattered, coy sidestep, with the
observation that such speculation is premature.
   That is not Wilder's style.
   There's been talk, he was told, that he might be a vice
presidential choice in 1992 on a ticket headed by somebody like
Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas.
   ``I've heard that, too,'' Wilder said.

   It's increasingly fashionable to knock the
tobacco industry, but the salvos from public officials and
consumers have yet to seriously threaten its political health.
   Both sides in the battle over cigarette smoking agree the
tobacco lobby is losing few fights on Capitol Hill and winning
significant victories at the state level.
   ``I wouldn't feel sorry for them yet,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., chairman of a House health subcommittee. ``They still
have a formidable amount of power in the Congress and influence
around this country. They still have economic clout.''
   One of the most powerful industry trade groups is the Tobacco
Institute, representing the nation's cigarette-makers. The
institute has nine field offices with three employees each, plus
lobbyists in all the state capitols and some key cities. Its
political action committee raises about $200,000 for federal
candidates during each two-year election cycle, and it has PACs in
many states.
   On the other side are anti-smoking groups, growing in both size
and sophistication, making their case with lots of passion and not
much money.
   The two major national groups are the grass-roots Americans for
Nonsmokers' Rights and the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, which
represents the American heart, lung and cancer associations and
other voluntary health groups.
   Reinforcing their efforts is Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan, who does not miss a chance to slam the tobacco
industry.
   He has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to
inner-city blacks and undereducated young women, and reported that
smoking costs the country $52 billion a year in bad health and lost
productivity. He's also asked advertising agencies to reject
tobacco accounts, TV stations to warn viewers against smoking and
athletic associations to reject ``blood money'' from tobacco
companies seeking to sponsor sporting events.
   And that's just this year.
   The tobacco lobby lost a big one when Congress passed the
smoking ban that took effect last month on nearly all domestic
airline flights. Its only comparable defeat came in 1983, when the
federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to 16 cents.
   After the airline ban took effect, some congressmen said they
would turn their attention to railroads. Just a few weeks later,
Amtrak announced it would eliminate smoking on some trains and in
some stations effective April 1.
   While keeping damages to a minimum in Congress, the industry
often has prevailed on the state level. Its latest project is to
win statewide pre-emption laws that impose some smoking
restrictions but bar cities or counties from passing anything more
severe.
   Such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more
localities enact smoking ordinances. One of the strictest took
effect this year in Greensboro, N.C., a key tobacco state.
   ``When you have 95,000 local units of government in this country
and you have a finite amount of resources, then the smart thing to
do is to try to limit the potential for mischief,'' said Walker
Merryman, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute.
   Mark Pertschuk, director of the Berkeley, Calif.-based Americans
for Nonsmokers' Rights, said his group is getting its best results
at the local level. That's where 90 percent of anti-smoking
activity occurs, from protecting non-smokers to banning vending
machines and free samples, Pertschuk said.
   Pre-emption laws are thus ``an extraordinary victory'' for the
tobacco industry, he said.
   A pre-emption law recently passed in Virginia placing
limitations on public smoking. What worries Pertschuk more is
tobacco interests winning in states where their crop never has been
king, like Pennsylvania, Florida and Illinois.
   But if some state capitols still are in the grip of the tobacco
lobby, Pertschuk and others believe the industry's hold on Capitol
Hill is weakening.
   As evidence, they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage
of anti-tobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced.
   Some of the plans would ban advertising, one would limit ads to
text only, with no logos or photographs, and another would give
states the power to limit cigarette billboards.
   Others would raise the cigarette excise tax, eliminate tax
breaks for business expenses associated with cigarette advertising
and promotion, tighten federal regulation of toxic cigarette
ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco research
and education campaigns.
   Proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory
and expect to achieve at least some of their agenda this year.
   ``Many of my colleagues understand that public opinion has moved
dramatically on the whole issue of tobacco,'' Waxman said. ``Public
opposition to tobacco is growing. The strength of the anti-smoking
majority is growing.''
   Pertschuk said the entire anti-tobacco agenda is passable, given
enough constituent pressure on members of Congress.
   ``People just basically laughed at us when we asked to ban
smoking on airplanes four years ago,'' he recalled. ``It was not
considered to be at all feasible. It's just in hindsight that it
seems doable.''
   But Merryman described the airline smoking ban as an isolated
defeat.
   ``We were the only opponent,'' he said. ``And the time is long,
long past when any single vested interest could hope to defeat
legislation.''
   The airline scenario is unlikely to be repeated because labor,
business and civil liberties groups and even President Bush have
aligned themselves with the institute against various of the other
initiatives, Merryman said.
   ``The issues don't dovetail at all,'' he said. ``People who
don't like smoking on airlines are not in favor of censorship or
regressive taxation.''
   Even if all the proposals passed, Merryman said, ``Nothing
that's pending is going to put us out of business.''
   Nor is he worried about Sullivan's rhetoric or leaks of
controversial marketing campaigns.
   ``We'll roll with those punches. They're not fatal by any
means,'' he said. ``Anybody who thinks we're down for the count is
deluding themselves.''

   Problems plaguing the nation's health care
system are bringing Democrats and Republicans, physicians and
consumer advocates together on at least one point: Change is needed.
   But what those changes should be could keep them arguing for a
long time to come.
   Meanwhile, America's health care bill keeps mounting. This year,
medical expenditures are expected to exceed $600 billion _ nearly
12 percent of the nation's gross national product _ while as many
as 37 million people go without any sort of medical insurance
coverage.
   ``We're on an unsustainable path,'' said Jack Meyer, a
Washington health policy consultant.
   But he and other analysts say that with many in Congress averse
to new spending and lawmakers still stinging from last year's
repeal of the Medicare insurance program for catastrophic illness,
major changes in the health system are not imminent.
   ``The voting public is not yet exercised about this for it to be
a major political issue, but that's changing,'' said Lynn
Etheredge, a health policy consultant based in Chevy Chase, Md.
   Businesses, hit by rising health-care premiums, are passing
along more of the costs to their workers and pulling back some of
the benefits. Health care benefits have been the central issue in a
growing number of labor strikes.
   ``The average American worker ... is unaware of the magnitude of
the cost'' of health-care benefits, said William Ferguson, chairman
of the board of Nynex Corp., where workers last year staged a
four-month strike in which health coverage was a main issue.
   ``But they are starting to wake up. Workers are beginning to
understand that rising health costs are putting a dent in their pay
raises,'' he said at a recent gathering of health care providers.
   Earlier this month, the bipartisan Pepper Commission, which
included leaders of tax and health-care committees in Congress,
completed a year-long study with a proposal to provide health-care
coverage and long-term care for all Americans.
   However, the heath-care part of the plan was approved by only a
one-vote margin and the package was immediately criticized because
it did not recommend a way to pay the estimated $66 billion federal
pricetag.
   Many of the various players in the existing health care system _
including insurance companies, physicians, unions and corporations
_ have come up with their own proposals.
   And new groups and coalitions are still forming around the
issue. Just this month, 35 major corporations, unions, consumer
groups and other private organizations formed the National
Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform. It's the first attempt
by big business and labor to join in drafting a plan.
   Of the proposals that have been put forth so far, only a few
advocate a government-run health system or go to the other extreme
with a purely private approach. Most fall into a middle ground
that, like the Pepper Commission, calls for a public-private
sharing of the burden.
   Most of the plans would build on the existing system of
employer-provided health insurance _ 85 percent of Americans are
covered in this way now _ with various incentives or mandates for
business to include more workers in these programs. Some would
create risk pools to make affordable policies available to those
who because of chronic disease couldn't otherwise afford insurance.
And the government would have responsibility for taking care of the
rest.
   Most policy analysts and health-care consultants say this
middle-ground approach is the only one that is politically
possible, but even then it's not a sure bet.
   ``We will address a national health plan when the president
makes it an issue for his administration,'' said Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank in
Washington.
   ``The administration will move when it feels there's a good
political opportunity,'' he said. ``And the key for any
administration will be further crumbling of business opposition to
government involvement.''
   He doubts the public will rise up in protest and demand
solutions to the deficiencies in the current system.
   ``Any time 85 percent of the population is insured and receives
the best medical care in the world _ it may be a little too
expensive but so are automobiles, and people will grouse about that
_ they're not going to grouse enough to make it a salient political
issue,'' he said.

   Soil and water conservation programs are
viewed kindly by the public and members of Congress. Almost like
mom's apple pie, or dad's, as the case may be.
   But there's a darker side, and special people in the Agriculture
Department are looking into the cubbyholes and stairwells to see
what evil lurks in the name of conservation.
   Another major interest is USDA employee integrity and possible
conflicts of interest within such big divisions as the Farmers Home
Administration, the so-called lender of last resort for low-income
rural people.
   The specialists are the auditors and criminal investigators of
the Office of Inspector General, an agency of 850 employees charged
with preventing and detecting fraud, waste and abuse.
   Conservation and FmHA are only a couple of targets in the
inspector general's hunting grounds. Every USDA agency and program
operated by the department _ and the non-federal entities that
receive USDA aid _ is subject to scrutiny.
   But the huge expansion of the Conservation Reserve Program
authorized by the 1985 farm law is one of the main focal points of
this year's sleuthing operations.
   The program is administered by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, the sprawling agency that
for decades has channeled federal commodity programs to farmers
through more than 2,800 county offices.
   Accountants and auditors look at financial statements, review
agency compliance with laws and regulations and sniff out flaws in
operations that impair effectiveness. The investigators are special
agents who specialize mostly in crimes involving USDA programs.
   According to the 105-page annual plan for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1, the inspector general's team is attempting to
``identify large-scale schemes and devices used by financial
institutions and others'' to evade $50,000-per-year payment
limitations specified under Conservation Reserve Program contracts.
   ``The scope (of the audits) will be limited to individuals,
entities or financial institutions that received a large number of
CRP payments but were not in the land management business prior to
the CRP,'' the report said.
   One of the tasks is the evaluation of land and producer
eligibility for the program. The program enables a farmer to take
highly erodible cropland from production for 10 years and plant it
in protective grass and trees.
   In exchange, the government helps pay the cost of installing the
protective cover, plus annual rental payments, which average around
$50 an acre. About 34 million acres are in the program so far; the
target is to have at least 40 million.
   Related audits are under way to see if the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service established effective
controls to verify that farmers receiving 1989 disaster assistance
complied properly with requirements to purchase federal crop
insurance for the 1989 crop year. Other rules also are being looked
at.
   ``A recent audit survey disclosed several instances where land
enrolled was not farmed during the base period years and therefore
was ineligible,'' the report said. ``Some farmers have submitted
false records to ASCS to show that acreage was planted in prior
years.''
   Another round of audits is directed at 1989 drought aid to see
if crop yields and payment rates were properly used in computing
assistance for ``non-program'' crops covered by last year's law.
   On the investigation side, most work originates from referrals
by USDA or other federal agencies and individuals. Priorities are
given to threats to public health and safety; employee integrity,
including allegations of bribery, embezzlement, and theft or
collusion with program recipients; and fraud in the loan and
benefit programs.
   Recent disclosures of influence-peddling and other improprieties
in the Department of Housing and Urban Development prompted the
inspector general's planners to ``conduct an evaluation of the
controls over and the propriety of rural rental housing project
approvals'' in the Farmers Home Administration, the report said.
   ``We also plan to conduct a review of the statements certain
officials are required to file concerning outside financial
interests (and) an evaluation of management controls over the
prevention, detection and resolution of prohibited employee
activities, such as conflicts of interest,'' the report said.
   Additionally, the inspector general's plan calls for ``a
determination of the feasibility of requiring financial disclosure
statements by all loan-approval and payment-approval officials.''
   Food programs, including food stamps, school lunches and other
child-nutrition functions, are fertile grounds for investigators on
the prowl for fraud and abuse.
   This year, for example, the agency projects that about 33
percent of its investigative work will involve the Food and
Nutrition Service. About 23 percent will be directed to Farmers
Home Administration operations and 17 percent to the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Food stamp fraud has often involved large-scale operations in
which thousands or millions of dollars have changed hands through
the illegal use of the federal coupons. In some cases, the stamps
have been used as currency for prohibited items, including liquor
and drugs.
   ``Since the authorized retailer is the key to eventual
redemption of illegally obtained food stamps, we will continue to
place major emphasis in this area,'' the report said.
   ``We will also look at unauthorized retailers, including those
previously disqualified from the food stamp program for serious
violations who continue to accept food stamps in willful disregard
of program regulations.''

   The king of the ocean predators is falling victim
to land's deadliest hunters, people, and may face doom unless
governments around the world agree to sharply limit shark catches.
   The shark-fishing industry boomed in the 1980s to feed the
world's growing appetite for shark meat, inexpensive and popular
with yuppies, and for delicacies such as shark-fin soup.
   Now the dusky shark, once common off the Northeast coast, has
all but vanished. The night shark, a formerly reliable catch in the
Florida Straits, is rarely spotted. A lemon shark research project
in the Keys was abandoned last year when researchers could not find
enough animals.
   And sport fishermen report the number of the sought-after mako
sharks caught in the Atlantic is dropping sharply.
   ``I think we are reaching a critical stage, if we are not
already there,'' said Eric Hawk, administrator for the National
Marine Fisheries Service in St. Petersburg. ``There is a strong
feeling that the reason we have not yet detected a collapse is that
there are many species out there, and it's hard to tell if some are
in trouble.''
   The U.S. Commerce Department is ironing out the final wrinkles
in a plan that would limit to 5,800 metric tons _ roughly a
half-million animals _ the commercial shark catch in federally
regulated waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern Atlantic and
Caribbean. Estimates are that three times that amount of shark will
either thrown away by boats seeking other fish, such as tuna, or
caught by sport fishermen.
   Hawk noted those limits would not apply to state waters _ where
65 percent of sport catches occur _ nor to countries like Mexico,
which may take double the U.S. catch.
   The fragility of the shark population and the shark's vital role
in shaping ocean evolution is only now beginning to be understood,
said Samuel Gruber, a University of Miami researcher who has spent
a lifetime studying the ancient animals.
   ``They are more like a whale than a fish _ they have their young
one at a time,'' Gruber said. ``But the sharks play a much more
important role than the whales, because they maintain the
ecological health and balance of the seas.''
   Just as wolves and mountain lions once culled antelope herds in
the American West, sharks have been guiding the evolution of fish
for 400 million years, he said.
   Anecdotal evidence from other biologists and sport fishermen
indicate the disappearance of sharks has accelerated over the last
decade, coinciding with the boom in commercial shark fishing.
   ``My impression is that the chickens have come home to roost.
This fishing has been going on for about 15 years, and that's how
long it takes for sharks to mature,'' Gruber said.
   The growing shark-fishing industry is suspicious of the
biologists' data and the Marine Fisheries plan projected to take
effect in June. They have hired an attorney and expect to sue the
program.
   Jim Bonnell, vice president of the Southern Offshore Fishing
Association and a shark fisherman, said reports from commercial
fishing fleets fail to support the theory that shark populations
are in trouble.
   ``In the years we have been doing this, we haven't seen any
decrease in the number of fish, or the size of the fish,'' he said.
   The 800-member association estimates there are 45 full-time
shark boats in the Tampa Bay area alone, and far more than the 150
estimated by the government in the area covered by the plan. Many
fishermen have already been hit hard by new reef-fish restrictions,
and switched to shark to make ends meet.
   Government biologists don't deny their data is sketchy. But they
insist it points to danger for sharks.
   A 1980 study estimated maximum sustainable yield for the region
was 25,000 metric tons. Yet industry reports show that in the past
decade up to 52,000 tons a year was fished annually, with most of
it thrown away by boats that caught sharks by accident as they
looked for other catches. The figure for 1988, the latest year
available, was more than 43,000 tons.
   ``There's too many fishermen and we're too efficient,'' says
Jack Casey, a Marine Fisheries biologist in Narragansett, R.I.
   Sharks have been in vogue before, he said, with sometimes
disastrous results. In 1938 several states developed shark fishing
to meet a demand for the animals' liver, which is high in vitamin
A. Most of the fisheries collapsed within 10 years, in part because
of over-exploitation.
   Government biologists warn that U.S. regulations are not enough
to guarantee the shark's long-term survival. Tagged blue sharks,
for instance, have been reported caught in 23 nations as they
migrate through the oceans.
   ``If the states and other nations don't adopt compatible
measures, we are just barking at the moon,'' Hawk said.

   America's 24-hour on-the-go lifestyle is
turning it into a nation of ``walking zombies'' who sacrifice sleep
to keep up, warns a Cornell University researcher.
   More than 100 million Americans work and play with insufficient
sleep _ nearly every other adult and teen-ager.
   In addition to damaging an individual's psychological and
physical well-being, sleep deprivation costs the United States
billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and medical costs,
said James Maas, chairman of Cornell's Psychology Department.
   Nearly half of all Americans short themselves of one to two
hours of sleep per night. By week's end, it's as if they'd missed a
full night.
   ``If you lose two hours of sleep because you go to a party on
Saturday night and then for the next five or six days you get your
normal sleep, which for most people is inadequate ... by Friday you
are like the narcoleptic,'' said Maas, an award-winning producer of
``Sleep Alert,'' a documentary broadcast recently on public
television and underwritten by North Chicago-based Abbott
Laboratories.
   ``There are some people who are literally walking zombies,'' he
said. ``If you need an alarm clock to get up in the morning, or if
you feel more than a minor sag in the middle of the day, you need
more sleep.''
   Maas said he sleeps 7\ hours a night but is trying to get eight
hours.
   ``I've been so busy with this program that I'm not getting as
much sleep as I should be right now. But I've at least regulated my
sleeping habits by making sure I'm in bed every night by the same
time (midnight),'' he said.
   ``More Americans undersleep than overeat,'' said Dr. Thomas
Roth, director of the Sleep Disorders Research Center at Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit.
   ``There is very little question the impact of sleepiness is
great,'' he said. ``How many airplanes have to crash because the
pilot falls asleep? How many nuclear plants have to shut down
because the operator falls asleep?''
   About 20 million Americans have work schedules that include
night shifts, and surveys indicate 55 percent of them nod off at
least once a week on the job, says psychologist Richard Coleman, a
sleep expert in the film.
   ``These people are not falling asleep on breaks, not lying down
on the job. They're trying to work,'' he said from Ross, Calif.,
where he heads a shiftwork operations consulting firm.
   ``Three Mile Island happened at 4 a.m., Chernobyl at 2 a.m.,
Bhopal at midnight, the Exxon Valdez at around midnight,'' he said.
   Charles Czeisler, director for Circadian and Sleep Disorder
Medicine at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, said part of the
problem is that shift workers generally are rotated to the earlier
hours, opposite of the body's biological clock, and they are
switched back and forth too frequently to allow them to adjust.
   An institute study at one plant using a rotating shift schedule
found that accidents increased significantly during the final two
hours of a shift and were 40 percent greater at night than in the
daytime, he said.
   Maas' documentary looks at how sleepiness affects the judgment
and reaction time of pilots, policemen and medical interns.
   One doctor says she measured sleep in minutes when she worked as
an intern, while a retired commercial airline pilot recalls a
flight when he awoke from a 10-minute nap to find the captain and
flight engineer also dozing.
   ``You're afraid you're going to face somebody with a gun on you
and you can't react in time because you're so tired and it doesn't
register fast enough,'' says a policeman.
   The consequences of sleepiness: loss of initiative and energy,
attention lapses, distractibility and fatigue _ and mistakes, Dr.
William Dement, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at the
Stanford University School of Medicine, said on Mass' documentary.
   The Institute for Circadian Physiology, a research center in
Boston, has reported that sleeping problems at work cost companies
roughly $70 billion annually in lost productivity, industrial
accidents and medical bills.
   Maas said researchers report that after five years, people who
work night shifts are twice as prone to heart ailments and
gastrointestinal diseases than those who work day hours.
   ``There's even evidence that people getting inadequate sleep
shorten their life span by eight to 10 years,'' said Maas.
   In some professions, sleepiness can have life-threatening
consequences.
   The National Transportation Safety Board cited pilot fatigue as
either the cause or a contributing factor in 69 plane accidents
from 1983 through 1986 in which 67 people died.
   Researchers have fashioned a test called the Multiple Sleep
Latency Test to measure sleepiness, said Roth. It is based on the
premise that the faster people fall asleep, the more sleepy they
are. At two hour intervals, the subject is asked to spend 20
minutes in a quiet bedroom trying to fall asleep.
   Ten-year-olds, who are fully alert all day, never fall asleep,
while narcoleptics are asleep within five minutes on every
occasion, he said. High school students often fall asleep as
regularly and as fast as the narcoleptics, he said.
   Maas said studies show high school seniors get an average of 6.1
hours of sleep a day, but need about 10 hours to function most
effectively. As many as 30 percent of high school students fall
asleep in class once a week, according to some studies, he said.
   While it is true children and teen-agers need more sleep than
adults, it is a myth that as we grow older we need less sleep. A
typical adult should sleep eight to 8{ hours a day, said Maas.
   ``There are no easy answers. People say when am I going to play
golf, or when am I going to do this or that. Parents and two-career
couples have household duties and child-rearing duties, they want
some leisure time. So what do they cut out? They cut out sleep
time,'' said Maas.
   An ability to lead a fast-paced life on little sleep is a trait
perpetuated by our around-the-clock society with it's all-night
shopping centers, cable television and 24-hour banking, said Roth.
   ``In our society sleep restriction is seen as a positive
thing,'' he said.
   ``Our society needs to rethink how it equates naps and staying
in bed late with laziness,'' said Maas. ``We should be just as
concerned about our sleeping patterns as we are about our diet and
exercise.''

<HEAD>Government Boosts Spending to Combat Cattle Plague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Mad cow disease'' has killed 10,000 cattle,
restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and
raised fears about the safety of eating beef.
   The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to
human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the
disease or how it is transmitted.
   ``I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,'' says Martin
Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. ``But they
certainly are not zero. I have not changed my eating habits, but I
certainly do wonder.''
   Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE,
was diagnosed only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like
scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s.
The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in
late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly.
   The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle
feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein
supplement.
   The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in
June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen,
thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. Sheep offal
is still used in pig and poultry feed.
   Earlier this month, the government announced it would pay
farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price,
whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE.
   ``I think it is a recognition _ not just of pressure from
farmers _ but that the public would feel more confident that no
BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the
food chain if there was 100 percent compensation,'' said Sir Simon
Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.
   The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. ``In the
course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite
normal to very vicious and totally disoriented.''
   As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed
with BSE.
   The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is
budgeting $16 million for 1990.
   Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases
have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the
British province of Northern Ireland.
   Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of
cattle, embryos and bull semen from Great Britain in July, said
Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
   Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland,
Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the
agriculture ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban
on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.
   David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of
``BSE hysteria'' in the media and has insisted that the risk of the
disease passing to humans is ``remote.''
   The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of
the disease.
   A commission chaired by Professor Sir Richard Southwood of
Oxford University reported last year that the cause of BSE ``is
quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.''
   The report said the disease was impossible to detect in
apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune
system to produce antibodies.
   The Southwood report said it was ``most unlikely'' that the
disease was a threat to humans. But the report added: ``If our
assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications
would be extremely serious.''
   There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About two dozen cases were reported in
Britain last year.
   Another form, known as kuru, had been found cannibals in New
Guinea.
   According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the
incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than
it is in countries free of scrapie.
   ``It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the
lack of effect of BSE on human health,'' a consultative committee
reported to the agriculture ministry. The committee's report,
released early this year, said it is only a ``shrewd guess'' that
BSE was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed.

<HEAD>FDA Looking at Microwave Packages That Pop Corn and Brown Pizza</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The special containers that make waffles brown
and french fries crisp in microwave ovens have prompted authorities
to question whether unsafe levels of chemicals are ending up in
food.
   At issue are heat susceptors, metallized discs or strips built
into packaging that absorb microwaves and act as little ``frying
pans'' to brown or crisp foods like fish sticks and pizza or pop
most of the kernels in a bag of popcorn.
   At least one consumer advocacy group recommends consumers avoid
products containing susceptors until the U.S. Food and Drug
Adminstration determines if worrisome levels of chemicals in the
packages migrate into food during cooking.
   ``We need to know what chemicals are getting into foods at what
levels,'' said Lester Borodinsky, a chemist with the FDA's Division
of Food Chemistry and Technology.
   Although the package components have FDA approval, the agency
did not evaluate them at temperatures above 300 degrees. Heat
susceptors can reach 500 degrees.
   ``Our crystal balls weren't very good back then,'' Borodinsky
said. ``If you think back 25 years ago, there were not very many
microwave ovens in use. These packages were not envisioned.''
    and flowed through cracks and
fissures to low-lying areas as far as 400 miles to the north over
the next 2 million years, creating the plateau, the theory holds.
   Another upwelling of lava is responsible for a ``hot spot'' of
volcanic activity beneath Yellowstone, the scientists suggest.
   The origin of hot spots far from the geologic plate boundaries
where most volcanos are located is a long-standing mystery in
geology. As the Earth's crustal plates drift over stationary hot
spots, new volcanos are formed and old ones become extinct.

<HEAD>Conference Told U.S. Should Take Lead in Solar Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the United States fails to become a
world leader in solar energy, a trillion-dollar new market could
fall to the Japanese, a national conference on solar power was told.
   ``Frankly, there has been a tendency by energy companies in the
past to label solar energy as a joke,'' said S. David Freeman,
general manager of the Lower Colorado River Authority.
   ``If we keep this up, the joke will be on us. We will see the
Japanese come in and put photovoltaic cells on our roofs and
solar-powered cars on our roads,'' Freeman said in the keynote
speech last week at a National Solar Energy Conference.
   Freeman's agency provides electric power to 33 cities and 11
cooperatives in Texas. He previously was an energy adviser in the
Johnson, Nixon and Carter administrations and was board chairman of
the Tennessee Valley Authority.
   He told the conference that historians in the future may wonder
why solar power wasn't investigated more vigorously during the late
20th century, while nations so heavily used such technologically
difficult and environmentally risky sources as oil and nuclear
energy.
   Freeman said a solar-energy breakthrough is crucial to the
survival of a high-energy civilization, particularly when U.S. oil
imports are soaring and concerns are growing over the environment.
   ``If one looks at the awesome problems posed by nuclear power,
at its best, one must wonder why this nation has not long ago
embarked on a `Manhattan'-type project to harness the sun,'' he
said.
   Freeman said he doesn't believe the solar industry needs
subsidies. ``But we do need to be advocating pollution taxes to
reduce pollution and to reduce the federal deficit,'' he said.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down
sharply in mid-afternoon trading Thursday and pessimism in the
currency market sent the yen tumbling against the U.S. dollar.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average was off 1,629.51 points, or
5.29 percent, at 29,177.68 in mid-afternoon, narrowing huge losses
than left the index at 16-month lows at the end of morning trading.
   In the early session, the Nikkei plunged 1,836.05 points, or
5.96 percent, closing at 28,836.05. It was the Nikkei's lowest
level since Nov. 15, 1988, when it ended at 28,829.41.
   The dollar started the afternoon at 155.20 yen following heavy
dollar-buying in the morning. It opened at 154.50 yen, up 0.85 yen
and was ranged between 154.50 yen and 155.45 yen during the early
session.
   Its morning close of 155.20 yen was the highest level since Feb.
9, 1987, according to the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank.
   ``This time, the plunges are really deep. It will take a rather
long time to recover,'' said Ikuko Sekiguchi, a dealer with Nikko
Securities.
   The stock plunge extended a series of huge losses on the world's
largest stock exchange, which has plunged more than 20 percent
since the start of the year.
   The Nikkei lost a combined 1,809.25 points on Monday and
Tuesday. The markets were closed Wednesday because of a national
holiday.
   The usually lively, crowded floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
was sober and subdued as a rush of sell orders met with virtually
no buyers. Almost half of the issues listed on the the exchange
trading floor's electronic billboard remained unquoted.
   Trading was estimated at an exceptionally low 180 million shares.
   ``Selling came mainly from institutional investors acting prior
to the year-end account settlements,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a
chief dealer at Nikko Securities Co.
   The sales were intended to offset earlier losses or cash out
losing positions, he said. Institutional investors have been
selling in an attempt to reduce risk ahead of closing their books
for fiscal 1989, which ends March 31.
   Shimoyama said the yen's continuing weakness, despite the
discount rate increase, accelerated selling.
   Japan's central bank raised its official discount rate Tuesday
by one percentage point to 5.25 percent. Analysts blamed a delay in
the long-anticipated increase for destabilizing Japan's financial
markets.
   ``Market players were overwhelmingly dumping issues, but that's
not panic selling yet,'' Shimoyama said.
   Kazuto Aizawa, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities
Co., said he could not foresee a recovery in the market ``unless
the government takes some measure, because the loss is so big.''
   Currency dealers said the yen declined further as the stock
market's huge loss discouraged currency investors.
   ``It's like a rat race situation, as the stock and foreign
exchange markets are affected by each other's performances,'' said
a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, who asked not to be named.
   The Bank of Japan was seen intervening in the market throughout
Thursday morning, but the action had no major impact on the yen,
dealers said.
   Local news reports said the bank sold about $700 million. The
central bank does not officially comment on its market
interventions.
   Traders attributed the dollar's higher opening in Tokyo to a
strong showing in New York on Wednesday. Multiple factors,
including escalating tensions in the Soviet republic of Lithuania,
were said to have contributed to the U.S. currency's strength.
   Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union on
March 11, but the Soviets have termed the move illegal. Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev Wednesday ordered Lithuanians to turn
in their weapons.
   Investors often regard the dollar as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   Discouraged by the yen's decline, the price of the benchmark No.
119 Japanese government bond plunged to 85.75 points in the
afternoon from Tuesday's close at 86.27 points. Its yield rose to
7.40 percent from 7.29 percent.

<HEAD>Brady Doesn't Support Pension Fund Tax Incentive Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady says he
opposes a proposed bill to tax the short-term capital gains of
pension funds because it might open the legislative door to other,
unwanted taxes.
   Brady told a Senate panel Wednesday that while the Treasury
Department ``does not now'' support the proposed legislation ``we
applaud its objectives of promoting long-term investment.''
   But Brady told the Senate Finance Committee that ``agreeing to a
tax on pension funds might lead to taxes on individuals and other
entities to which we would be opposed.''
   The bill, sponsored by Kansas Republican senators Robert Dole
and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, would tax the capital gains that
pension funds make from the sale of securities held less than six
months. The bill would tax only funds with $1 million or more in
assets. Most funds now pay no tax on any gains.
   In 1987, pension funds held 24 percent of the securities traded
in this country.
   ``I believe that steps are needed to lengthen the time horizons
of investors and corporate executives,'' Brady testified.
``However, I am concerned that we have not thought long enough to
be sure (the bill) is the answer.''
   Brady said the Treasury wanted to work with Congress to devise a
plan balancing the needs for market liquidity, capital and a secure
source of retirement income.
   He suggested working through Bush administration proposals to
cut the capital gains tax and encourage family savings through tax
incentives.
   Business executives and critics of the 1980s merger mania have
complained that investors, particularly large institutional
investors like pension funds, have been concerned only with
short-term profit on their shareholdings.
   They argue that has increased the pressure on corporations to
concentrate on the quarterly bottom line at the expense of
long-range planning, research and development, and nurturing
endeavors that don't promise quick returns.
   ``That bodes ill for our country's future economic growth and
prosperity,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the committee
chairman.
   Earlier, Kassebaum told the committee the bill ``is not designed
to raise revenue. I would be happy if it didn't raise any revenue
at all.''
   Her bill would impose a 10 percent tax on pension fund profits
from the sale of securities held up to 30 days, and a 5 percent tax
on gains from securities held between 30 and 180 days.
   Opposition to taxing pension fund capital gains also came from
officials of the National Associations of Manufacturers, the Public
Securities Association and the AFL-CIO.

   The nation's new economic ministers
said Wednesday they would shelve or modify most of the radical
economic reforms pushed by their predecessors, including a system
requiring use of true names on financial transactions.
   The nation's largest opposition party warned that any reversal
of reform policies would heighten political tension by incurring
violent protests by dissidents and underprivileged groups.
   New Economic Planning Minister Lee Seung-yun declined to discuss
details but said he would announce by the end of this month ``new
prescriptions'' to help revive the sagging South Korean economy.
   ``All policies are subject to change as the prevailing
circumstances warrant and I think it is feared some landmark
reforms being pushed could create a lot of problems,'' he told
reporters.
   The controversial reforms center on a system requiring Koreans
to use their true names in all financial transactions beginning
next year.
   Outgoing economic ministers said the new system would promote a
fair economic environment by preventing tax evasion on all
financial transactions.
   But the new system is shocking to millions of Koreans who are
used to using pseudonyms for secret dealings in stocks, bonds and
bank accounts.
   Government analysts estimate that about 10 percent of all Korean
financial transactions are conducted using pseudonyms and about 30
percent of bank accounts are kept under false names.
   Investors already have begun moving their money to overseas
accounts and land speculation. Land and housing prices more than
doubled in the past year.
   Kim Dae-jung, president of the largest and most radical
opposition group, the Party for Peace and Democracy, warned that a
cancellation or stay of the system would sharpen social and
political antagonism.
   ``The shelving of the system would only benefit big businesses
and those who `have.' Those who `have not' will feel frustrated and
protest more vigorously,'' he said.
   Lee, a 58-year-old ex-finance minister, was named to the
nation's top economic post in a sweeping Cabinet reshuffle last
Saturday that affected 15 of 22 posts.
   South Korea's economy is experiencing difficulty with slow
exports, high inflation and low capital investment. Exports in the
first two months of the year shrank 2.5 percent from a year ago,
helping create a trade deficit of $1.27 billion.
   The consumer price index rose 1 percent in January and 0.9
percent in February, threatening the government's plan to curb 1990
inflation to 7 or 8 percent.
   Unemployment rose from 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent this year
after the nation's economy grew only 6.5 percent last year, which
compared with annual double-digit growth rates in the three
previous years.
   Last year's Korean growth rate remains high by international
standards, but experts say the Korean economy needs to grow at
least at least 7 percent a year to absorb 700,000 new people
seeking jobs annually.
   One aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said bank lending
rates currently ranging between 10 and 12.5 percent could be cut by
at least 1 percent soon as an economic stimulation move.

   A gunshot hit a Greyhound bus Wednesday night,
cracking a window but leaving the driver and passengers unhurt in
the latest violence in the strike against the country's only
nationwide bus company, authorities said.
   In another development three days after Greyhound broke off
contract talks with its striking drivers, the company expanded bus
service to 70 new locations, mostly between Boston and Washington.
   The bus, carrying 30 passengers to Dallas, was on an entrance
ramp to Interstate 35 in San Antonio around 7:30 p.m. when the
bullet hit its service door, said Travis County sheriff's Lt.
George Meek.
   The driver continued about 70 miles north to Austin before
reporting the shooting, Meek said. The assailant was unknown.
   The bullet penetrated the first window of the double-window
door, but not the second because it contained thick, insulated
plastic, the lieutenant said.
   The incident brought to at least 15 the number of shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses. There have also been 46 bomb threats
and numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats, company
officials say.
   State police in Virginia investigated a shooting attack on a
Greyhound bus carrying about 50 passengers from Roanoke into
Christiansburg late Tuesday. No one was injured. Trooper E.R. Adams
said holes in the windshield apparently were made by a
small-caliber rifle.
   Greyhound abruptly ended strike talks Sunday, accusing union
leaders of stonewalling and of stepping up attacks on buses and
replacement drivers.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and
grievance procedures.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions said it would
resume negotiations at any time.
   ``The company walked away from the table about 10 a.m. Sunday,
but the union stayed at the table,'' said union spokesman Nick
Nichols. ``As far as we are concerned, we are still at the table,
waiting for them to come back.''
   Frank J. Schmieder, president and chief operating officer of
Greyhound Lines Inc., said that as of Wednesday, ``we are running
46 percent of our pre-strike schedule miles. That is an increase of
35,617 miles daily compared to yesterday, or 14 percent.''
   That included restoration of service to 70 locations, mostly in
the Boston-Washington corrider, as replacement drivers complete
training, Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said.
   ``Today, we're up to 1,514'' drivers, Gravley said. ``The first
day we had around 300.''
   Tuesday's ridership was 45,829 passengers, about one-third of
ridership on the same day last year, the company said.
   The union said it believes Greyhound is operating at 15 percent
of pre-strike levels. A restoration of service to 70 communities,
when Greyhound served 9,500, ``doesn't say much,'' said spokesman
Nichols.
   In Chattanooga, Tenn., a judge issued a restraining order
Wednesday limiting picketing at the city's Greyhound terminal to
two people and forbidding acts of violence or intimidation. A
similar restraining order was issued Tuesday in Fayetteville, N.C.
   The company has obtained a total of 17 restraining orders
against the union, Gravley said.
   Greyhound downplayed Tuesday's decision by Standard &amp; Poor's to
downgrade the company's credit rating from B to B-. Wall Street's
premier bond rating company cited a $380 million debt from a 1987
leveraged buyout and said the strike has ``caused substantial
losses.''
   ``We feel we have a sound financial position and we're just
continuing to operate as we had planned to do all along,'' Gravley
said. ``We're not in the market to borrow money right now so it's
not going to affect us immediately.''

<HEAD>Ad Campaign to Tout New York as Shopping Mecca</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campaign touting New York as a shopper's
paradise is being planned for later this spring in an attempt to
counter negative publicity about retailing woes.
   The advertising campaign, centered on the slogan ``There's a
World of Shopping in New York,'' is part of a broader promotion of
the positive aspects of New York's businesses. Variations on the
``There's a World of ...'' theme, eventually will be adapted for
restaurants, theatre, health care, banking and other industries.
   Retail was chosen as the subject to kick off the feel-good
campaign in part because city government officials and business
leaders felt it was time to highlight the pluses because the
minuses had been getting a lot of attention.
   Don Klein, chairman and creative director of the MacNamara Clapp
&amp; Klein Inc. ad agency, which is developing the campaign, said
Wednesday the retail promotion has a two-pronged mission.
   It is aimed at attracting customers to the shopping
opportunities in the city and attracting retailers to open
businesses here.
   He said the ads aren't meant to refute the widely publized
problems that have been plaguing numerous retailers.
   ``We're not going to be talking about the negative. Those
problems have been disproportionately blown up,'' he said in an
interview.``This is simply to remind people of the vastness and the
diversity that is New York City.''
   The plight of several prominent U.S. retailers grabbed headlines
over the Christmas season.
   As the peak shopping season started, B. Altman &amp; Co., a
venerable old retailer, went into liquidation. Department stores
owned by the debt encumbered Campeau Corp., including
Bloomingdale's, slashed prices to boost sales and raise cash,
forcing their more financially sound competitors to follow suit.
   New York, always known for stiff competition in retailing, was
the scene of some of the fiercest battling for market share in the
country over the holidays.
   A preview of the new retail promotion was given at a breakfast
meeting hosted by the Association for a Better New York, the Fifth
Avenue Association and the Mayor's Office for Economic Development.
   Retailers who recently have opened stores in New York or plan to
in the near future spoke optimistically about doing business in the
city.
   Among them were Marashu Isogai, executive vice president and
general manager of JUSCO, the Japanese holding company of the
Talbots Inc. women's clothing chain, and Ermenegildo Zegna,
executive vice president of an Italian menswear manufacturer and
retailer.
   Lewis Rudin, chairman of ABNY and operator of a major property
management company, said at the meeting that boosting retail
business in New York could help alleviate some of the city's fiscal
woes by generating more tax revenue.
   The city is believed to be facing possibly its worst financial
crisis ever. The new mayor, David N. Dinkins, said earlier this
week that the city's budget deficit is much larger than the $1.1
billion gap estimated in February.
   Mary Holloway, executive director of ABNY, said details of the
campaign, including costs, still are being worked out and will be
unveiled at a news conference probably in late April.
   The campaign will be spearheaded by the association and the
Mayor's Office for Economic Development. Advertisements are
expected to appear in newspapers and magazines and be carried on
television and radio.

<HEAD>Amtrak Will Eliminate Smoking on Some Trains</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak will eliminate smoking next month on
some trains and in some stations under new policies that will more
strongly segregate nonsmokers and those who want to light up.
   No-reservation trains of three or fewer cars will be designated
no-smoking, Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said Wednesday.
   ``This will affect a number of trains in the East, some in the
Midwest and one in the Northwest,'' she said. ``Seventeen routes
will have some trains that at least on some days have no smoking at
all.''
   Two lawmakers who led the successful fight to ban smoking on
most domestic flights said Wednesday that the nation's passenger
railroad would adopt the tougher smoking policies April 1.
   They jumped the gun on Amtrak's own announcement of the new
policy, which had been scheduled for today.
   ``These new rules are another victory for health and common
sense,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on transportation. ``It's further
acknowledgement that nonsmokers should not be forced to breathe
other people's smoke.''
   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., a member of the
House transportation appropriations panel, had said after the
airline smoking ban took effect Feb. 25 that they would turn their
attention to railroads.
   ``It is my hope that eventually nonsmokers will be able to ride
smoke-free on all forms of public transportation,'' Durbin said.
   Although passengers will be permitted to smoke in sleeping
compartments and lounges on longer trains, smoking will be
eliminated in:
   _First-class cars on all trains in the Northeast Corridor that
don't require reservations. Reserved-seat Metroliners will carry
smoking cars and will set aside smoking areas in first-class cars.
   _All areas except a portion of the lounge on other trains
requiring reservations.
   _Coach cars of reserved-seat, double-deck Superliners operating
west of Chicago. Currently, Amtrak allows smoking in the last four
rows of Superliner coaches. The new policy will limit Superliner
smoking to the lower level of the lounge car, Ms. Martin said.
   _Stations smaller than 1,100 square feet.
   _At least three-quarters of the area of larger stations.
   Amtrak's ultimate goal is to separate the 25 percent of its
passengers who smoke from the 75 percent who do not, Ms. Martin
said. Toward that end, Amtrak will begin locating its smoking cars
at the front or rear of unreserved trains so nonsmokers need not
walk through smoking areas to reach their seats.
   The Amtrak policy changes drew fire from the Tobacco Institute,
the lobby for cigarette manufacturers.
   ``Once again we're seeing unnecessary regulation above and
beyond what is necessary,'' said institute spokesman Thomas Lauria.
   ``Train travelers have accommodated each other, smokers and
non-smokers alike, ever since we've had trains,'' Lauria said.
``Obviously this is an attempt to put smokers in the back of the
bus once again. On shorter trains, it seems mean-spirited to ban
smoking altogether.''
   Lauria said he anticipated resistance from smokers to Amtrak's
intended smoking restrictions in stations.
   According to Ms. Martin, the changes are part of the national
passenger railroad's fine-tuning of its smoking policy as the
number of smokers drops.
   ``We feel it is very important for our marketing effort to
continue to permit smoking on longer trips,'' Ms. Martin said. ``It
simply doesn't make good business sense to eliminate smoking
altogether.''

<HEAD>Japanese Visitors to Hawaii Go Nuts Over Macadamias</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese tourists shell out so much money for
macadamia nuts when they visit Hawaii that Agriculture Department
trade analysts refer to the nutty souvenirs as suitcase exports.
   Macadamia nut production is also catching on in California, and
in other countries. The U.S. output has more than doubled since the
late 1970s to an estimated 5,900 metric tons in 1989.
   John O'Connell of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said world macadamia production has been growing rapidly, including
a 60 percent increase in Australia since 1987. A sharp expansion is
also indicated over the next decade in Africa and Central America.
   ``With trees popping up all over, it has been estimated that the
world supply of macadamia nuts will double in five years and triple
in 10,'' O'Connell reports in the April issue of AgExporter
magazine.
   That will cause producing countries to ``compete fiercely for
export markets,'' he said.
   O'Connell added Wednesday in a telephone interview that the
so-called suitcase exports of macadamia nuts to Japan are almost
impossible to estimate accurately, although $15 million annually
may be conservative.
   The value of direct nut exports is approximately $5 million a
year, meaning that the suitcase shipments are at least triple the
known level, he said.
   In his report, O'Connell said the Japanese custom of giving
gifts after returning from a vacation is behind the macadamia mania.
   ``Local retailers in Hawaii have observed that a Japanese
tourist will often buy several boxes, or even a case of macadamia
nut products, while mainland U.S. tourists usually buy only one or
two boxes,'' he said.
   Several other Asian markets are developing, including Hong Kong,
Singapore and South Korea. But if promoters have their way, the
biggest export prize yet may be Europe, where macadamia nuts are a
relatively unknown oddity.
   O'Connell said macadamia trees are native to Australia, but
commercial nut production began in Hawaii after World War II. The
nuts are similar in size and shape to filberts but have a taste and
texture all their own.
   Harvested nuts are de-hulled, cracked and roasted before being
processed into salted, candy-coated or chocolate-coated forms, or
used as ingredients in bakery, dairy and other products.

   The Agriculture Council of America says it
intends to set the record straight about the safety of the U.S.
food supply.
   According to the Washington-based organization, a ``foodwatch''
campaign will involve a nationwide education and awareness program
``to inform the public about extensive health and safety measures
currently in place that govern how food is grown and processed.''
   The program also will focus on the importance of biotechnology
being developed and its role in maintaining and improve the food
supply.
   ``Reflecting on the events of 1989, we saw a year filled with
consumer skepticism about the food supply,'' the ACA said in a
recent report. ``One news article after another raised new concerns
over the integrity of the U.S. food supply and the technology used
to produce it.''
   The ACA and its education foundation represent a cross-section
of farm, commodity and agribusiness interests.
   Larry Sitzman, a corn farmer from Culbertson, Neb., is chairman
of the foodwatch committee. He said farmers should be proud of what
they produce.
   ``We need to be working together to keep our food and fiber
system the best, not pulling it apart,'' Sitzman said.

   A Californian has taken over as head of the
Rural Electrification Administration, an agency of the Agriculture
Department.
   Gary C. Byrne, formerly a banker and financial manager in
Sacramento, Calif., was sworn in Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter. He was nominated by President Bush in December and
confirmed by the Senate on March 9.
   As the 11th administrator of REA, which was created in the 1930s
to bring electricity to the nation's farms, Byrne will oversee a
$37 billion portfolio of loans to rural electric and telephone
cooperatives.
   Byrne's experience included leadership in the Bank of Alex
Brown, Sacramento, and financial posts with the company's

   The president of Japan's largest corporation was
taking calls from irate shareholders this morning as the price of
the company's stock fell more than $500 a share.
   Like the heads of many other Japanese companies, Haruo
Yamaguchi, chief executive of telecommunications giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., was struggling to find an
explanation for the dive.
   ``NTT's performance has not weakened at all. ... We can't avoid
drifting with the general current,'' Yamaguchi told reporters at a
luncheon gathering.
   NTT stock _ Japan's most expensive _ fell $516 a share this
morning but recovered slightly in the afternoon, closing at $6,903,
a loss of $452 or 6.1 percent for the day.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index plunged nearly 6
percent in the morning but recovered somewhat to end the day off
3.13 percent.
   ``We are making the utmost efforts to raise the price,''
Yamaguchi said.
   NTT's stock was first offered to the public at $7,742 a share in
February 1987, two years after the former telecommunications
monopoly was turned into a private company. It had the largest
stock market valuation in the world.
   He said NTT plans to seek approval at its stockholders' meeting
in June to raise the dividend from $32.25 to $38.70, or 12 percent
of one share's face value of $322.50.
   Yamaguchi said he owns 10 shares, adding that he and other
directors are not permitted to sell their shares.
   On the first day NTT stock was listed on the Tokyo exchange in
1987, there were 1.28 million buy orders for the 10,000 shares then
offered. Two months later, NTT was trading at $20,516 a share.
   Most Japanese share prices are in the $6 to $13 range.
   As more and more Japanese turned to the stock market in efforts
to expand their sizable savings, investors saw NTT shares as a safe
bet, although then-NTT President Hisashi Shinto expressed worries
about a collapse in its price.
   ``I was a high school student in 1938,'' he said, ``and I still
remember clearly the panic of the stock market crash.''
   The Tokyo market's key index fell 14.9 percent in the October
1987 global crash, but quickly recovered.
   It ended 1989 trading with a series of record highs, before
turning around this year and falling 23 percent amid worries over
higher interest rates and declines in bond prices and the yen's
value.
   NTT stock had its own problems, including declining investor
interest in telecommunications. Then, Shinto and other NTT
executives were implicated early last year in a major bribery
scandal.
   For the fiscal year ended March 1989, NTT reported a 14.3
percent decline in unconsolidated pretax profits. It cited lower
long-distance revenues after competitors were allowed in the
market, and lower revenue from data communications services.
   In September, the government, which still owns 10.2 million of
NTT's 15.6 million outstanding shares, put off plans to sell 1.95
million shares to the public. It cited various factors, including a
slump in NTT's share price, which was then about $9,678.
   More recently, investors have been put off by calls by a
government advisory committee for breaking NTT into three separate
companies _ for local, long-distance and mobile telecommunications.
   Still, Yamaguchi said he did not understand the latest slump in
the stock price, which fell $129 on Monday and $258 on Tuesday. The
market was closed Wednesday for a holiday.

   North Carolina State's computer labs have
been hit by a virus which is leaving students smoking over its
message.
   ``Your computer has been stoned. Legalize marijuana.''
   The virus is known as ``Stoned.'' It first popped up in
Wellington, New Zealand in 1988 and slowly has been wreaking havoc
on computers across the world.
   On the North Carolina State campus, the virus has wiped out some
students' work in computer labs.
   ``It has been nightmarish,'' said Tracy Carver, a lab assistant
in the Humanities Computer Lab, where ``Stoned'' became such a
menace that the lab had to shut down for a day and a half this past
week.
   Computer labs across campus are requiring users to check their
floppy disks at the door so they can be scanned for ``Stoned'' to
make sure it is kept under control.
   The efforts have worked so far, but on Tuesday, ``Stoned'' was
making its pro-pot pitch known again in the social sciences
computer lab.
   Computer viruses like ``Stoned'' are programs that copy
themselves between computers and destroy files, overload the system
or otherwise irritate users. More than 70 such viruses are known to
be circulating worldwide, with points of origin as far flung as
Jerusalem (birthplace of a virus that deletes files at random on
Friday the 13th) and the Netherlands (first home to the ``Holland
Girl Virus'' that provides victims with the phone number of a girl
named Sylvia after the damage has been done.)
   Witty though the creators of such virus programs may be, campus
computer users aren't laughing.
   ``This is a perverse form of intellectual sabotage,'' said
Michael Vasu, director of the social sciences computer lab. ``The
only purpose to write a virus is to destroy. You have someone with
a high degree of technical competence who needs a basic course in
ethics.''

   A concerted campaign to make it easier to sell
American products in Japan appears to be yielding some results, but
also is triggering debate over how far Tokyo should go to meet U.S.
demands.
   Negotiators on both sides are racing to meet a mid-April
deadline for a report on progress toward reforming business
practices and laws that hinder efforts to reduce Japan's $49
billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Washington has been demanding urgent action on key trade issues.
It contends that Japan's business world is too closed, that land
policies sharply boost the cost of doing business in Japan and that
this country should increase public investment to help reduce
dependence on exports for economic growth.
   In a March 2-3 summit with President Bush and in talks with
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher in Tokyo last week, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu pledged to carry out some of the reforms
sought in the negotiations.
   At Kaifu's behest, trade officials are drafting an interim
report on steps to narrow the trade gap and the reforms. The report
is to be released in mid-April and Japanese reports say Japanese
and U.S. officials are working on it this week in Warrenton, Va. A
final report on the talks is due in July.
   Japanese press reports on the draft report, which has not been
made public, indicate Kaifu is making limited progress on the types
of major changes demanded by the United States.
   _ Fair Trade Commission officials said Tuesday they were
considering raising penalties for violations of Japan's
anti-monopoly law. U.S. officials say lax enforcement of the law
enables Japanese companies to form cartels and exclude foreign
firms from their markets in a number of areas, including
construction and electronics.
   _ Local media say the interim report also includes plans to ease
enforcement of a Japanese law that protects small neighborhood
shops from large retail competition.
   U.S. negotiators contend that by forcing supermarkets and
department stores to wait up to 10 years to open new outlets, the
law prevents foreign-owned stores like Toys 'R' Us from setting up
shop in Japan. Larger Japanese stores are more likely than small
shops to sell foreign-made goods, they say.
   _ Mosbacher, sent to Tokyo by Bush to follow up on trade
demands, returned to Washington with at least one souvenir: pledges
from two Japanese car makers to buy more American-made
semiconductors, and promising responses from other major
corporations.
   _ The economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun says the draft
report includes plans to step up spending on roads, sewers and
parks; ease restrictions on corporate takeover bids, and impose
higher taxes on some farmland in an attempt make more available for
commercial and residential use, thus pushing down sky-high land
prices.
   Despite these signs of progress, Japanese negotiators are shying
away from U.S. requests for measures requiring legislative approval.
   Japanese officials have refused to comment on the media reports.
   Japan's business community has strongly opposed U.S. calls to
revise the anti-monopoly law, saying it only needs more rigorous
enforcement. There also is strong opposition to abolishing the
retail stores law, which business leaders and officials say would
cause an economic slump.
   They express concern that the far-reaching reforms demanded by
Washington would sacrifice traditional sectors of the economy, like
small shops, and perhaps even the nation's robust economic growth
for the sake of uncertain improvement in trade figures.
   And despite calls for fully opening its agricultural markets to
reduce high food prices, Japan has remained adamant against lifting
a ban on rice imports. It says it wants to protect its
self-sufficiency in a staple food and preserve rural traditions.
   While many analysts say U.S. pressure is needed to bring
consumer-oriented reforms in Japan, they say the onus for change
should be placed on Washington.
   ``America believes Japan needs to make big changes. Most
Japanese don't. We have made big changes already. It's necessary
for the United States to change,'' former trade ministry official
Makoto Kuroda told the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper in a recent
interview, echoing the sentiments of many past and present trade
officials.
   The officials also question whether the United States will
follow through on pledged reforms aimed at boosting export
competitiveness and reducing the high consumption fueling demand
for imports.
   ``We are under pressure to show results, but we will only
promise what we can actually carry out,'' said one Japanese
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The U.S. side will
promise all sorts of things, but there's no guarantee they can
follow through.''
   Recent trade figures indicate the two countries are slowly
whittling away at their enormous trade imbalance, which accounts
for 45 percent of the total $105.9 billion U.S. trade deficit.
   The trade imbalance, which peaked at $57.9 billion in 1987, was
$49 billion last year. In January, it dropped to its lowest montly
level in five years _ $2.9 billion.
   ``We are on the right track. The question is whether it will
move fast enough to meet political demands,'' the official said.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply to a better-than-expected $2.23 billion in February, the
government said Thursday.
   The reported providing some relief to the financial markets by
easing the pressure for another interest rate hike.
   The seasonally adjusted shortfall compared with a revised
deficit of $3.23 billion in January, the Central Statistical Office
said.
   The markets have been worried that Britain's 15 percent interest
rates would be raised to boost a sagging pound and fight 7.7
percent inflation. Such a hike had seemed more likely after
analysts said the government's new budget, announced Tuesday,
wasn't austere enough to curb inflation.
   The current account deficit also narrowed to $2.23 billion from
$3.23 billion the office said.
   The merchandise trade and current account figures were the same
because the invisible trade included in the current account figures
was in balance in February. Invisible trade includes services,
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments.
   The financial markets had been expecting a merchandise trade
deficit of $2.4 billion and a current account deficit of $2.5
billion.
   Exports fell to $13.4 billion in February, from a revised $13.6
billion in January. Imports fell to $15.7 billion from a revised
$16.8 billion.
   Since the beginning of the year, Britain's merchandise trade
deficit has shrunk to $5.5 billion, compared with a deficit of $6.7
billion at the same time a year ago.

<HEAD>Punctual Passengers Can Avoid Tardy Flights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A traveler can't do much about making an
airliner arrive on time, but it is possible to avoid flights that
are notoriously late.
   More than two years after a law required airlines to report the
on-time performance of each flight, few passengers seem to be
taking advantage of a simple clue to flight tardiness.
   The clue is a single digit in the code every flight is assigned
in travel agent and airliner computers. On a scale of 9 to 0, each
flight is rated for punctuality.
   An example: If you were thinking of taking USAir Flight 896 from
Philadelphia to Boston at 5:55 p.m., you could know that your
chances of arriving late are excellent. ``Late'' is defined as more
than 15 minutes behind schedule.
   In the latest monthly report, covering January, that flight was
rated ``0'' and was the tardiest in the country, arriving an
average of 44 minutes late 96.4 percent of the time.
   The clue lies in the flight's code that appears in airline and
travel agent computers. The current code for the USAir flight has
improved to a ``1.'' That means that lately it has been arriving on
time between 10 and 20 percent of the time.
   A ``2'' at the end of a flight's computer code would mean the
flight lands on time between 20 and 30 percent of the time, and so
on up to the 90 to 100 percent range.
   A rating of less than 30 percent gets ``chronically late''
honors in the Transportation Department's monthly Air Travel
Consumer Report.
   So what does a traveler do if the flight has a low score?
   A Philadelphia passenger who wants to improve the odds of
arriving on time in Boston could take Delta Flight 648 at 4:50
p.m., which has a 60 to 70 percent on-time record, or USAir Flight
424 at 5 p.m., which has a 40 to 50 percent record.
   But how often do customers ask for this information?
   ``No one ever has,'' said Yolande Frommer, referring to
customers at her Washington, D.C. travel agency.
   They'll ask the type of aircraft, how many seats are in a row,
where the exits are and what movie is playing, she said, but they
don't think to ask the chances of the plane arriving on time, even
though it often is a major concern.
   Many people simply aren't aware that the information is
available.
   Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the American Society of Travel
Agents, said that although few travelers ask for the data, some
agents notify customers when the on-time rating is below 50 percent.
   ``It's clearly down the line in factors that will affect a
decision'' about which flight to take, Davidoff said.
   The data come from the airlines, which are required by law to
report to the government each month. Delays due to mechanical
problems are not counted in the ratings because the government
thinks that including them might encourage airlines to rush repairs
to keep up their on-time rating.
   Richard Livingston of the Airline Passengers Association of
North America, a consumer and safety advocacy group, said he thinks
the government should pay more attention to the relative safety and
security of flights instead of collecting data that might not be
used by passengers.
   ``They tend to focus too much on delays,'' he said.
   In addition to the flight data, the monthly Transportation
Department report tells which of the 30 busiest airports have the
most on-time arrivals at each hour of the day. It also tallies lost
baggage reports and logs consumer complaints to the government.

   Toys intended for older children often get
into the hands of younger siblings, so the federal consumer
protection agency says some of them should have warning labels.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission moved Wednesday to
require labels warning that younger children can choke on small
parts in toys intended for children over age 3.
   The commission told its staff to devise rules for the toy
industry to develop mandatory warning labels for toys intended for
3 to 6 year-olds which have potentially dangerous small parts.
   The products affected include toys intended for children ages 3
to 6 _ games such as ``jacks'' which include small balls, marbles
and balloons.
   The commission left unanswered whether the new rules might also
apply to children's jewelry and other accessories, arts and craft
equipment, puzzles and other items.
   In moving toward hazard warnings for specific toys, the
commission sidestepped urgings by consumer groups and members of
the medical community to review and develop a new small-parts
standard.
   The agency has received reports of 146 deaths since 1980 of
children under age three involving products intended for older
children but staffers said they could identify only eight which
might have been prevented by use of a more different test standard.
   ``The potential benefits to change are low,'' said commission
chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith.

   U.S. shares were mixed early today following
another substantial loss in the Tokyo stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.25 points at
2,730.18 at 10 a.m. EST. The broader market was lower, however.
Declining issues outnumbered advances by around 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 593 issues down, 336 up and 544 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 25.87 million shares.
   Some analysts expect Wall Street to decline moderately today in
the wake of the Japanese fall.
   After a break for a national holiday Wednesday, the Tokyo stock
market fell again in chaotic trading today, three days after the
third-worst drop in its history.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 963.85 points, ending
the day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Today's drop puts the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   Dealers blamed the market tumble on the Japanese yen's
continuing erosion against the dollar. The yen's losses come
despite Tuesday's 1 percent rise in Japan's official discount rate
to 5.25 percent, which was intended to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.08 at 186.74.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had risen
0.05 to 363.20.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones average fell 10.81 points to
2,727.93.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by around 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 873 down, 588 up and 495 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 130.99 million shares, down from 177.32
million in Tuesday's session.

   Authorities were investigating three incidents in
which Greyhound buses were fired upon by unknown assailants, the
latest in a string of shootings since company drivers went on
strike nearly three weeks ago.
   None of the shootings, which occurred Wednesday night in Texas
and early today in Missouri and Illinois, caused any injuries, said
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley.
   In another development, the drivers' union disputed Greyhound's
claim that it is operating at 46 percent of its pre-strike
schedule, based on mileage covered. A spokesman for the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions estimated that Greyhound is
operating at 15 percent of pre-strike levels.
   The latest round of violence brings the number of shootings to
at least 17 since the strike began March 2.
   In San Antonio, a sheriff's officer said 30 passengers were
aboard the bus when a bullet struck its service door on an entrance
ramp of Interstate 35.
   The bullet did not penetrate the thick window and the
Dallas-bound bus continued about 80 miles north to Austin before
its driver reported the shooting, said Travis County sheriff's Lt.
George Meek.
   A second shooting was reported on Interstate 55 south of St.
Louis when two shots struck the windshield of a bus carrying 19
passengers from St. Louis to Memphis, Tenn. The incident was being
investigated by the Missouri Highway Patrol, Gravley said.
   At Collinsville, Ill., not far from St. Louis, four shots struck
a bus en route from Chicago to St. Louis, Gravley said. Eight
passengers were aboard when the two shots struck the windshield and
two struck the side of the bus.
   The company announced Wednesday that it had restored service to
70 locations mostly in the Boston-Washington corrider. Replacement
drivers who completed training took over most of the routes, said
Gravley.
   ``Starting today, we are running 46 percent of our pre-strike
schedule miles,'' Frank J. Schmieder, president and chief operating
officer of Greyhound Lines Inc., said Wednesday.
   But union spokesman Nick Nichols said restoration of service to
70 communities, when Greyhound had served 9,500, ``doesn't say
much.''
   Gravley said Greyhound had 1,514 drivers, five times more than
it did the first day of the strike.
   About 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other employees struck the company
over wages, job security and grievance procedures. Contract talks
broke down Sunday in Arizona and have not been rescheduled.
   Union officials said the company offered a plan that failed to
include guaranteed pay raises, but would have made raises
contingent on increased profits and ridership.
   The company says in addition to the shootings, 46 bomb threats
and other incidents of vandalism have been logged.
   Nichols said the union has documented at least 32 incidents of
violence against strikers, including the death of a picketer who
was crushed by a bus and assaults by Greyhound managers against
pickets.
   ``Regrettably this stuff is happening,'' Nichols said. ``Both
sides are, I believe, legitimately concerned about it. I don't know
what more we can to convince people that, regardless of whether
they're union members or not, that this is not the way to behave.''

<HEAD>Nearly 600 Employees Out of Work; Imports Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two big textile companies, Cone Mills Corp. and Milliken &amp; Co.,
said they were laying off more than 800 employees between them
because of increased competition from imports.
   Cone Mills said Wednesday it was shutting down its 450-employee
American Spinning Plant in Greenville, S.C.
   Meanwhile, Milliken said it would close a mill in Robbins S.C.,
putting 255 people out of work, and would eliminate 129 jobs from
its Drayton Mill in Spartanburg, S.C.
   A statement issued to Milliken employees Wednesday afternoon
said that, ``While all of us have worked very hard to be successful
with our customers, it has not been enough to overcome the massive,
continuing growth of imported textile products into the United
States.
   ``This huge and escalating textile import burden has directly
impacted the Drayton Plant and made it impossible for that plant to
continue full operations,'' a company statement said.
   Cone Mills Chairman Dewey Trogdon also cited imports in the
closing the American Spinning plant. He also blamed rising fiber
costs and the plant's multi-storied layout, which made it
impractical to install more modern equipment.
   Employees learned of their job losses as the House Textile
Caucus launched a new campaign for legislation to curb imports of
textiles and apparel.
   Milliken spokesman Terry May and Cone Mills spokesman Jim Butner
said the cutbacks had been considered for several weeks, but both
said the announcements were not timed to coincide with the Textile
Caucus's decision to introduce a textile bill.
   Layoffs at the Milliken plants will begin in about 60 days, but
May said he did not know when they would be completed. The cutback
at the Drayton plant will still leave about 90 employees on the job.
   May said the plant will continue to make yarns used in men's and
women's clothing.
   The displaced workers would be able to transfer to other
Milliken plants without loss of seniority or benefits, according to
the company statement.
   Cone Mills layoffs will begin in late May and will be completed
by the end of June, Butner said.
   Cone Mills is one of the nation's largest producers of denims
and corduroys. It employs about 9,000 workers at 15 plants in the
Carolinas and Mississippi and has annual sales around $700 million,
Butner said.
   Milliken has estimated sales of $2.5 billion a year. The company
has 14,300 employees at 55 plants in the Carolinas, Georgia, Canada
and Europe.

   Debt-ridden Southland Corp., which owns 7,000
7-Eleven convenience stores, said today it has agreed to sell a
controlling interest to its Japanese partners for $400 million and
the assumption of debt.
   Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd., Japan's second-largest supermarket
operator, and longtime Southland affiliate 7-Eleven Japan, which
Ito-Yokado controls, would acquire 75 percent of Southland's common
stock under terms of the deal, Southland said in a statement.
   The Japanese companies would pay $400 million in cash. The deal
is contingent upon the restructuring of Southland's $1.8 billion in
debt and of its outstanding preferred stock.
   The deal, which has been approved by Southland's board, also
must be approved by a syndicate of 32 banks, the company's lenders.
   Southland spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood said the total acquisition
cost was not yet known, but the leading Japanese financial journal
Nihon Keizai Shimbun today estimated the deal at about $1 billion.
   In addition to company-owned 7-Eleven stores, Southland's six
food processing centers and five distribution centers are also
included in the deal.
   Independent licensees and affiliates also operate more than
5,900 7-Eleven stores in the United States and 21 foreign countries.
   7-Eleven Japan, the largest convenience-store operator in Japan,
operates 3,940 licensed stores. Ito-Yokado, which Southland
described as Japan's most profitable supermarket chain, owns 50.3
percent of 7-Eleven Japan. Southland has had a 17-year affiliation
with the Japanese concerns.
   Suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth, Southland has
been strained by debt associated with its $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout in 1987, which gave Dallas' Thompson family control of the
chain.
   For the nine months ended Nov. 30, 1989, Southland lost $299
million on revenue of $6.3 billion. The company attributed the loss
to heavy interest payments and additional charges associated with
the buyout.
   Southland said in November it faced a liquidity crisis. To meet
substantial debt payments last year, the company sold off its
half-ownership of Citgo Petroleum Corp., which supplies many of its
stores with gasoline.
   Southland's bank group has ordered the company to submit a
restructuring plan by May 31. Under terms outlined in the company's
news release, Southland proposes to issue new bonds in exchange for
outstanding bonds and issue additional common stock.
   ``During the course of the last six months, we have reviewed a
broad range of alternatives that would maintain the long-term
viability and success of Southland,'' said John P. Thompson,
Southland's chairman.
   ``We believe this strategic alliance ... is the best way to
achieve the company's goals.''
   The deal caught some Southland employees off guard. Johnny Lacy,
who works at a 7-Eleven in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch,
said he was confused by the announcement because the company's
monthly newsletters have portrayed an increasingly fit firm.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``I thought the Thompsons were
getting the company back on its feet. From the newsletters, it
seemed like everything was going uphill.''
   Ito-Yokado said it was approached by Southland in late January
to participate in the both the financing and management of the
company's restructuring.
   Because of current friction over Japanese investment in U.S.
companies, Masaaki Kamata, senior managing director of Seven-Eleven
Japan, stressed that the agreement was made in response to
Southland's request for assistance.
   Kamata said great care would be taken to explain the deal to
political and financial leaders in the United States with an
interest in the company.
   Masatoshi Ito, the chairman of 7-Eleven Japan and president of
Ito-Yokado, said he sees the deal as the beginning of a worldwide
partnership.
   ``As the world largest convenience store chain, e will maintain
and build upon our mutually strong market positions by combining
the operating skills and strategic thinking of the American and
Japanese companies,'' Ito said.
   Another Southland spokesman, Harris Diamond, said the Japanese
firm will be represented on the Southland board of directors if the
deal is completed.
   The Thompson family would retain about 15 percent of the company
and would remain on the board, the spokesman said.
   ``There will be no layoffs, and no store closings,'' Diamond
said. ``In fact, we believe the $400 million cash infusion is going
to be a tremendous asset.''
   Thompson said the money will be used for improvements as well as
advertising and promotion.
   ``We believe this transaction is necessary to preserve the
business we've built,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate approached a showdown today over
whether to provide aid to coal miners who lose their jobs because
of new pollution controls, and the outcome could determine whether
a clean air bill passes this year.
   The coal issue has placed two of the Senate's most powerful
members at odds: Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was Mitchell's predecessor as Senate
leader and still wields immense power as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
   ``I expect that (the coal miner issue) will be resolved one way
or another today,'' said Mitchell, meeting with reporters before
the Senate resumed debate on the clean air bill.
   No action on the amendment is expected until late in the day,
however.
   Byrd, arguing for his proposal on the Senate floor, declared:
``The coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price... they
will lose their livlihood.''
   Byrd has been pressing an assistance program for miners in his
state and elsewhere if they lose their jobs because of tougher acid
rain controls at coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.
   On Wednesday night, he offered to lower the package's expected
cost from $700 million over four years to $500 million over three
years.
   Byrd's amendment, offered nearly two weeks ago, has threatened
to derail progress in enacting the first improvements in federal
air pollution controls in 13 years.
   The White House vigorously opposes the assistance plan and
Mitchell is fearful its passage might cause the compromise clean
air bill, worked out in lengthy negotiations with the Bush
administration, to unravel.
   The miner aid issue was expected to come to a head today as
Mitchell tried to work out a compromise with the White House, while
Byrd was likely to press for a vote on his amendment.
   ``I'm not going to stand here and say I've got 51 votes (needed
for passage), but I can tell you, `You don't have 51 votes either.'
And I can tell you I'm very close,'' Byrd told Mitchell during
floor debate Wednesday night.
   While the Senate has been considering a string of amendments on
the floor, the miner assistance program has been the hottest topic
behind the scenes.
   There has been intense lobbying by the White House to defeat the
amendment and an administration source said Wednesday that it has
become less interested in seeking a compromise and was prepared to
try to defeat the proposal.
   Mitchell and Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., meanwhile, have
been trying line up senators to vote against Byrd's proposal, but a
vote on the amendment was put off twice because its defeat was not
certain.
   Offering his revised assistance proposal, Byrd complained that
the White House was unwilling to negotiate and that he wanted a
vote.
   Mitchell and Dole said they expected a response shortly from the
administration on a compromise assistance plan, crafted by aides to
Mitchell, that would include benefits to coal miners as well as
other workers that could lose their jobs because of tougher
pollution controls.
   Many senators have complained that if coal miners were to be
given special assistance, the same should be provided to workers in
other industries.
   The Senate spent most of Wednesday debating and then defeating a
proposal aimed at tightening smog pollution controls in the
nation's cities.
   The amendment, which lost, 53-46, would have preserved the
federal government's authority to impose air pollution reduction
plans if states and localities failed to act.
   It also sought to eliminate waivers for some industrial
polluters if the controls were too expensive and would have
broadened the smog-reducing requirements to include smaller
polluters.
   Earlier in the week the Senate killed requirements for tighter
automobile emissions controls and an expanded alternative fuels
program to reduce urban smog.
   The two proposals were singled out by environmentalists as being
essential to assuring improved air quality in major cities.
Earlier, another strengthening proposal which would have required a
reduction in toxic chemical emissions from automobiles fell by
65-33.
   With the three defeats, environmentalists said they planned to
focus on the House, where a clean air bill is still in committee,
in their attempt to strengthen curbs on smog-causing pollutants.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders
ignored news of a new U.S.-Soviet grain deal and focused instead on
weakness in the stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 21 points at
mid-morning following a steep drop in the Tokyo stock market.
   The government today announced an agreement with the Soviet
Union that will increase the annual minimum shipments of U.S. grain
to the Soviets to 10 million metric tons from nine million tons
under the current agreement.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets are committed to buy at least
four million tons each of wheat and feed grains. But Moscow can
substitute up to 750,000 tons of one commodity for the other.
   The deal was viewed as bullish for grain prices but was
overshadowed by the sharp drop in stock prices.
   ``If the stock market keeps going down, they're not going to pay
any attention to the grain agreement,'' said John Frazier, director
of the agricultural division of Gerald Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to } cent lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.58} a bushel; corn was
\ cent to } cent higher with May at $2.58 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to \ cent lower with May at $1.48} a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with May at $6.02} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .55 cent higher with April
at 77.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .48 cent
higher with March at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .32 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with April at 52.77 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .05 cent to .93 cent higher with March at 51.50
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Lease Sales Suggest Industry Recovering, Federal Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil companies bid nearly $590 million for the
right to drill in U.S. waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the biggest
total in five years and a sign the industry is recovering, federal
officials said.
   ``The oil and gas business is starting to pick up a little,''
said Barry Williamson, director of the U.S. Mineral Management
Service. ``Energy trends are starting to stabilize, and that's good
news for the oil and gas industry, and the state of Louisiana.''
   Ninety-five companies offered bids at Wednesday's government
lease sale, 15 percent more than participated in the most recent
comparable sale a year ago.
   The bids totaled $589.5 million for leases on 2.7 million acres
of waterbottoms in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Bids likely
to be accepted by the government came to $427.4 million, also the
biggest since 1985 when winning bids totaled about $1.1 billion.
   MMS spokesman Barney Congdon in New Orleans said the government
received more offers on fewer tracts this year _ 840 on 538 tracts
compared with 821 bids on 591 tracts last year bid by 83 companies.
   Congdon said the government last received a larger total bid in
1985, when the figure was about $1.2 billion. Last March, at a
similar sale of central Gulf leases, oil companies bid a total of
$397.5 million, he said.
   The highest bid of the day was $11.1 million won by a
partnership of Italy's Agip Petroleum and Union Texas Petroleum
Holdings Inc. in an area called Vermilion South.
   The highest bid per acre was $3,559.12 from Samedan Oil on West
Delta block.
   Williamson said the growing interest also shows that more
independent producers are getting back into the offshore business.
   Wednesday's lease figures are preliminary. It was not known how
many would eventually be accepted by the Mineral Management Service.
   Congdon said billion-dollar sales were common in the late 1970s
and early 1980s, with totals of $2 billion in 1981 and $3.5 billion
in 1983. Then came the oil bust.
   ``Those were the high numbers. Now they're down to the
millions,'' Congdon said.

<HEAD>Vacancy Rates Soar Amid Wall Street Recession</HEAD>

   The 25th floor of the south tower of the
luxurious World Financial Center is empty save for a few boxes. So
are the 26th, 27th and 28th floors.
   In the booming mid-1980s, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. expected to fill
the space easily. The nation's largest securities firm booked two
full towers in the ultra-modern complex in lower Manhattan that
opened in 1986, using conservative estimates of employment growth.
   Then Merrill scaled back to one tower plus about half the
second. After the 1987 stock market crash even that was too much,
and now the firm plans to sublet nine floors, including the four
undeveloped ones.
   On Wall Street _ and Broad Street and Greenwich Street and
Battery Place _ a securities industry recession has created an
office-space glut in the world's premier financial district.
   Vacancy rates are soaring in the maze of silver office towers
and aging stone monoliths where stock trading began almost 200
years ago under a buttonwood tree. Property brokers compare the
slump to the mid-1970s, when New York teetered on bankruptcy.
   ``We're still headed south,'' said Robert F.R. Ballard, an
executive vice president with the real estate firm Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, who has worked in the Wall Street building market since
1959. ``We haven't bottomed out yet.''
   Manhattan real estate brokers say the vacancy rate in the
downtown financial district is approaching 20 percent, vs. 8
percent to 12 percent in 1985 during the securities industry boom.
   Put another way, the 14 million square feet of available office
space downtown equals three empty buildings, each as big as a
110-story World Trade Center tower.
   The glut is expected to worsen because hundreds of thousands of
square feet to be abandoned by firms such as Merrill, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., Salomon Inc. and collapsed Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. haven't been tallied yet.
   Unprecedented growth in stock trading and investment banking
gave rise to hand-over-fist hiring and expansion by Wall Street
firms in the 1980s.
   Average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange shot
up from 32.2 million shares in 1979 to 189 million shares in 1987,
while employment in in New York's securities and commodities
industries grew from 74 million to 163 million.
   During that period, Wall Street firms set ambitious expansion
plans, tied to the seemingly limitless possibilities of another
boom. Building ``world headquarters'' seemed logical to accomodate
technological advances that required more space for more computers
for more trading into the 21st century.
   ``Many of the financial firms don't indulge in what we call
intelligent strategic planning regarding their space needs,'' said
Joel Wechsler, a managing director of the real estate firm Edward
S. Gordon &amp; Co. ``They're getting a little more sophisticated in
that area now.''
   Stock market volume, securities underwriting, mergers and
takeovers and other financial businesses are down sharply. Since
the crash, the securities industry has lost more than 40,000 jobs.
   ``The vacancy rates are directly related to the shrinkage in the
financial services industry,'' said Anthony M. Saytanides, Edward
S. Gordon's chief operating officer.
   Ballard put it less gently: ``The developers built too much
space. The tenants rented too much space. The market took a
nosedive.''
   During the decline, several projects were abandoned and other
overly ambitious ones have cost firms hundreds of millions of
dollars. Salomon took a $150 million accounting charge against
earnings after dropping out of a major project. Two firms that
named buildings for themselves _ E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. and Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. _ are history.
   Shearson, the No. 2 brokerage behind Merrill, spent $450 million
to build a 39-story office tower known as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Plaza. The firm plans to fill the building, which opened late last
year, but also is firing up to 5,000 workers this year, which could
lead to more unused space.
   Workers in reduced Shearson departments say they can roam floors
almost undisturbed. The firm's new tower is adorned with a
Parthenon-like frieze, and some wags say it too could wind up a
monument to a golden age.
   ``There may be some discussion in hindsight whether it was the
most effective use of the firm's money at the time,'' a Shearson
official privately conceded, adding that it is evaluating space
needs as part of an overhaul.
   Merrill decided to move in the early '80s, when its headcount
was growing by 13 percent annually. It booked the World Financial
Center space anticipating only half that growth. But since the
crash, Merrill has slashed its work force back to a 1980 level.
More cuts are planned.
   The firm took a $470 million charge against earnings last
quarter for its restructuring _ $220 million to cover real estate
commitments, nearly all of that in New York.
   ``The growth has certainly gone in the other direction,''
Merrill spokesman Fred Yager said. ``Our fixed costs have been
reduced considerably and one of our biggest fixed costs is real
estate.''
   For the real estate market, the glut's the thing. While modern
office spaces such as the World Financial Center and World Trade
Center complexes are almost fully occupied, older buildings are
bearing the brunt as firms move out.
   The average asking rent downtown is falling, but not in
proportion to available space. Brokers say top-line offices still
command around $35 per square foot, among the highest in the
country. Some prices for older buildings, though, have fallen into
the single digits, just like in the 1970s.
   Brokers estimate the downtown vacancy rate will climb well above
20 percent once a rash of moves _ some across New York waterways to
cheaper Brooklyn or New Jersey _ are completed. In the mid-'70s,
the rate was about 25 percent, brokers said.
   Among the untallied moves: the Securities Industry Automation
Corp.'s move to new quarters, abandoning 200,000 square feet;
Salomon's shift to 7 World Trade Center, leaving 500,000 square
feet behind; the consolidation by Merrill and Shearson; and about
1.5 million square feet by Drexel.
   During its junk-bond driven heyday, Drexel planned to build new
headquarters downtown. The firm wisely scrapped the project after
settling securities fraud charges with the government last April
and trimming 4,000 employees by selling its retail brokerage
operations.
   Unwisely, in retrospect, Drexel last fall extended the lease on
its main Broad Street offices until 2004. Six weeks ago, Drexel's
parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, listing more than $470
million in domestic lease commitments outstanding.
   Some brokers say the market has even further to fall because at
least one sure sign of desperation has yet to take hold.
   ``During the '70s a lot of the older buildings were turned into
apartments,'' Ballard said. ``That hasn't happened yet, and if that
hasn't happened we haven't hit bottom.''

<HEAD>Tobacco Company Profits Up Despite Anti-Smoking Clamor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All the huffing and puffing against smoking has
failed to blow tobacco's house down.
   Industry analysts say profits in the tobacco business are
growing at a double-digit clip due to higher prices, improved
production efficiency, stable leaf costs and clever marketing. They
expect similar increases in the future.
   But the anti-smoking drive could have an unintended side effect.
Some media executives say newspapers and magazines will be hurt if
new limits on tobacco advertising are adopted.
   Publishers planning new magazines, for instance, must consider
in devising a business plan whether the magazine could survive if
tobacco advertising were banned.
   Tobacco opponents say their chief goal has not been to make
tobacco less profitable but to raise awareness of health issues and
to puncture the glamorous image of smoking that some cigarette ads
still promote.
   Results of their efforts are readily apparent _ smoking is
prohibited on most domestic air flights and in many public places
such as restaurants, hospitals and offices. One tobacco company
withdrew plans to test a new cigarette aimed at blacks after
disclosure of the plans stirred a barrage of complaints that it was
preying on a minority group.
   The segment of the adult population that smokes tumbled to 29.1
percent in 1987, the most recent year for which such statistics are
available, from 40.7 percent in 1966, the U.S. Office on Smoking
and Health says.
   Cigarette sales volume has also dropped steadily in recent years.
   The Tobacco Institute, a trade organization, said cigarette
shipments dropped to 562 billion in 1988, down 2.3 percent from
1987 and 12.2 percent from the peak of 640 billion in 1984.
   John C. Maxwell Jr., who follows the tobacco business for Wheat
First Securities in Richmond, Va., estimates sales dropped by 6.1
percent to 524 billion in 1989. He said the decline would have been
half as large without unusual efforts by one company to reduce
inventories held by wholesalers.
   But the decline in sales volume and the percentage of smokers
has not translated into a decline in cigarette revenue or profits.
   The Tobacco Institute said domestic cigarette revenue reached a
record $35.8 billion in 1988, up 6.5 percent from 1987.
   Tobacco company domestic pretax operating profits rose more than
10 percent last year to $7.2 billion, said industry watcher Diana
Temple. Philip Morris USA, the industry leader with 41.9 percent of
the market and the best-selling Marlboro brand, had an operating
profit of $3.6 billion alone on revenue of $9.5 billion in 1989.
   Ms. Temple, an analyst for the Salomon Brothers Inc. investment
firm, said the industry has reported an average 14 percent annual
increase in operating profits over the past five years. She said
the dropoff in 1989 reflected the unusually large volume decline,
not anti-smoking efforts.
   Maxwell said the anti-smoking effort hasn't cut into tobacco
profits and he forecast a continuation of double-digit increases in
operating profits for the forseeable future.
   He said the tobacco companies have been able to overcome the
impact of volume declines by raising prices as often as twice a
year. Ms. Temple said an average pack of cigarettes cost $1.44 in
1989, up 11 percent from 1988.
   Tobacco companies also have controlled costs by investing in
machinery that produces nearly twice as many cigarettes a minute.
In addition, domestic growers have been reluctant to raise raw leaf
prices, fearing cigarette makers will buy from foreign suppliers,
Maxwell said.
   Analysts also said that despite the well-publicized misstep in
developing a new cigarette for blacks, the tobacco companies have
proven adept marketers who have been able to identify customers and
tailor messages for them.
   Ms. Temple said tobacco companies also have grown more
profitable because few have dared challenge the six leaders _
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &amp; Williamson,
Lorillard, American Brands and Liggett Group. ``It is an
unglamorous business that doesn't attract a lot of new entrants,''
she said.
   Proposals to restrict tobacco advertising would not necessarily
hurt profitability and could improve it, analysts said.
   Maxwell said an ad ban would save money that would ``come right
down to the bottom line'' for tobacco companies.
   Ms. Temple said the tobacco companies would probably shift ad
spending to promotions, such as distributing free samples,
sponsoring concerts or sports events or setting up more store
displays.
   Federal Trade Commission figures show the tobacco companies
spent $2.58 billion on advertising and promotions in 1987,
including $413.5 million on advertising in newspapers and magazines.
   A recent study by a group of advertisers, media companies and
advertising agencies said that by 1993, a ban on tobacco
advertising could drive 165 magazines, or 1.3 percent of the
projected total of 12,490, and 12 newspapers, or 0.8 percent of the
projected total of 1,506, out of business.
   It said prices would have to rise to compensate for lost ad
revenue.
   Critics of the study said it failed to allow sufficiently for
the possibility that other advertisers would fill the void left by
tobacco ads, just as occurred when tobacco ads were banned on radio
and TV in 1971.
   But the possibility that tobacco ads will be banned is already
figuring into plans for new magazines.
   Michael Klingensmith, publisher of Time Warner Inc.'s month-old
Entertainment Weekly, said the magazine gets about 10 percent of
its ad revenue from cigarette companies and supports the right to
advertise a legal product.
   But he said in drafting the magazine's business plan he had to
consider the possibility of a tobacco ad ban. ``Anybody launching a
magazine today would have to consider that,'' he said.
   Alan Wragg, publisher of TV Time, a new weekly TV listings
magazine, said he is counting on a ``much smaller contribution from
cigarette advertising than if we were doing this five years ago.''

<TEXT>
   Long banned from American airwaves, the Marlboro Man still
gallops across television screens in the Philippines and other
developing countries where U.S. tobacco companies are selling more
cigarettes than ever and lung-cancer rates are soaring.
   As the market shrinks at home, the U.S. government is helping
American tobacco companies invade foreign markets, particularly
along the booming Pacific Rim.
   In Thailand, where 65 percent of men over 20 smoke, the U.S.
Trade Office is threatening sanctions unless import taxes and other
barriers to American cigarettes are lowered.
   Health groups from nine Asian countries sent a letter to
President Bush last year calling the threat ``a mockery of your
country's efforts to curb the export of other addictive drugs into
your country.''
   Billboards for Marlboro and Winston are common in Bangkok,
despite a year-old law prohibiting all cigarette advertising. Thai
health officials fear opening the door to U.S. tobacco interests,
as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan did four years ago, could mean a
sharp increase in the number of teen-age and female smokers.
   ``My bottom line is anti-smoking,'' said Dr. Prakit
Vatee-Satokit of the Thai Anti-Smoking Campaign Project. ``I don't
care if it's Thai or American cigarettes. I see people die of
smoking every day.''
   In Hong Kong, where American cigarettes dominate 70 percent of
the market, lung-cancer deaths increased 58 percent in the last
decade and the number of teen-age smokers is on the rise. Taiwanese
anti-smoking advocates say 85 percent of young smokers, whose ranks
are being filled through American hard-sell, prefer imports.
   Smoking _ and lung-cancer deaths _ are declining overall in some
Western European countries where health concerns mirror those in
the United States.
   In Britain, the heaviest smokers are blue-collar workers and
people in their 20s, but the number of teen-age smokers is
dropping. They were the target of the government Health Education
Authority's recent $16.5 million no-smoking campaign and an
anti-smoking group called Parents Against Tobacco.
   Young adults also are Italy's most avid smokers, although
smoking is declining overall. The most recent statistics say 29
percent of Italians smoked in 1986, down from 35 percent in 1980.
   The warning ``Smoking is dangerous to your health'' is printed
on all cigarette packs sold in Argentina and Uruguay, but surveys
say 68 percent of all men in Uruguay and 32 percent of women smoke.
   About 60 percent of the population of Japan smokes, and the
admonition ``Be careful not to smoke too much for your health'' in
barely visible print on cigarette packs does little to counteract
the impact of television advertising. Foreign actors such as James
Coburn and Roger Moore appear in ads promoting a glamorous image
for smoking, and Japanese cigarette companies have taken a cue from
their American counterparts by creating products for specific
groups, such as a brand for teen-agers called Dean after the late
actor James Dean, a hero among Japanese youth.
   Anti-smoking efforts have fared poorly in Japan, South Korea and
China, where 250 million smokers follow their leaders puffing Panda
and other domestic brands.
   Beijing did, however, participate in the first World Smoking Day
last April, when stalls in the city sold anti-smoking ointments and
mouth gargles.
   An official Czechoslovakian anti-smoking campaign called
``Chance For 3 Million'' _ a reference to the number of babies
expected to be born in that country in the next decade _ appeared
to put a damper on smoking for the first half of 1989. But smoking
is on the rise again, and the Health Ministry now calls the
campaign a failure.

   Share prices on Wall Street were lower in early
trading today following another substantial loss in the Tokyo stock
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.95 points at
2,706.98 at noon EST. Declining issues outnumbered advances by
around 10 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 987 issues
down, 354 up and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 86.23 million shares, up from
61.67 million traded by the same time on Wednesday.
   ``It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market,'' said Charles
Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp. ``We've been ignoring
that market for a couple of weeks. You can only ignore reality for
so long.''
   After a break for a national holiday Wednesday, the Tokyo stock
market fell again in chaotic trading today, three days after the
third-worst drop in its history.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 963.85 points, ending
the day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Today's drop puts the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   Dealers blamed the market tumble on the Japanese yen's
continuing erosion against the dollar. The yen's losses come
despite Tuesday's 1 percent rise in Japan's official discount rate
to 5.25 percent, which was intended to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   Traders in the United States also are concerned about company
earnings for the first quarter, due to be reported early next
month, which could show worse-than-expected results that would
depress the value of U.S. stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.37 at 185.45.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 1.25 to 361.90.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Express was
down { at 27\, Ford Motor had slipped &lsqb; to 47~, General Electric

   At a recent meeting with video
industry analysts, Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. executives
passed out free ``Cinderella'' tapes.
   The symbolism was subtle yet clear for those familiar with
Blockbuster's chief _ who went from the unglamorous world of trash
collection to the glitz of the movie industry and quickly
transformed an obscure group of video stores into the nation's top
chain.
   ``We're not twice as smart. We just work twice as hard,'' said
H. Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster chairman and chief executive
officer. ``We've only been at it for three years. I'd say that's
not too bad.''
   Huizenga also is unabashedly upbeat about his latest venture _
professional sports. Earlier this month, the 52-year-old
multimillionaire purchased a 15 percent share in the Miami Dolphins
football team and a 50 percent stake in Robbie Stadium Corp., which
operates the 75,000-seat home of the Dolphins.
   He predicts regular-season major league baseball will be played
in Miami before 1995.
   ``There is no question we'll get a franchise someday in Miami.
The question is how soon,'' said Huizenga. ``There's no reason not
to be optimistic.''
   Huizenga resembles former New York mayor Ed Koch, but doesn't
copy Koch's famous line: ``How am I doin'?'' Huizenga prefers to
let numbers tell the story.
   Since Huizenga purchased Blockbuster for less than $19 million
from a Dallas-based video retailer, the chain has grown from 19 to
nearly 1,200 outlets from Guam to England. At the present rate, an
average of one new Blockbuster store opens a day, and Huizenga
predicts sales could top $1 billion this year.
   Although Blockbuster's aggressive expansion has led to concern
by some industry analysts, Huizenga believes the pace is
manageable. About 160 of the nearly 400 stores opened by
Blockbuster last year were company-owned. The rest were franchise
operators who need little, if any, help in getting started, he said.
   ``So that's really about one store every other day we're
directly responsible for. It's fast, but not unreasonable,'' said
Huizenga.
   Blockbuster's Fort Lauderdale headquarters give only small hints
of show business. A glass-encased ship model and leather chairs
dominate the lobby of the Spanish-style building.
   A small framed picture of President Bush is signed: ``To my
video advisor.'' Nearby is a figurine of a teen-age boy slumped in
a chair. He's watching a video.
   For Huizenga, couch potatoes are generally sweet.
   ``This is nothing like the trash business,'' said Huizenga. ``If
someone rents a movie and doesn't like it, they blame Hollyood, not
Blockbuster. There are very few problems with customers.''
   Color television was still a novelty in the 1960s when Huizenga
took up a garbage collection route in Fort Lauderdale bringing in
$500 a week. Huizenga drove the truck and lugged the trash until
the business grew.
   Meanwhile, his uncles in Chicago were doing well with their
trash collection and salvage company.
   The two merged, and in 1971 put up the first public stock
offering of Waste Management Inc. Last year, the company reported
revenue of $4.5 billion.
   Although Waste Management is based in Chicago, Huizenga would
return each weekend to Fort Lauderdale, where he had moved as a
high school freshman.
   When he left the company in 1984, he began a number of ventures
ranging from a bottled water service to dry cleaning. He still
operates a helicopter fleet that picks up cash from atop banks.
   The rapid expansion of Blockbuster began almost immediately
after Huizenga's 1987 acquisition. Blockbuster's national presence
was boosted by the January 1989 purchase of Las Vegas-based Major
Video Corp.'s 175 stores.
   Now, Blockbuster is experimenting with huge video warehouses in
former supermarket sites. In Atlanta, one store features a
basketball hoop in the back for kids. The company prohibits X-rated
videos.
   Huizenga _ who foresees up to 3,000 Blockbuster stores in the
United States _ believes the company's most promising frontier lies
overseas. Blockbuster has 15 stores in the United Kingdom, 42 in
Canada and is negotiating for franchises in other European
countries and Australia.
   ``I don't see any reason we can't compete in Asia and South
America and anywhere people have VCRs,'' he said. ``Entertainment
is a universal commodity.''
   But some analysts wonder about Blockbuster's rapid growth. Last
May, Blockbuster stock fell following the release of a report by
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. that Blockbuster artificially inflated its
financial statements by writing off the costs of tapes over three
years, rather than nine months.
   Blockbuster has reported more than 100 percent increases in
earnings for two consecutive years. In 1989, Blockbuster revenue
was up 133 percent to $663 million and net income rose 153 percent
to $44.2 million.
   With the baseball pay negotiations settled, Huizenga said he and
several other south Florida corporate leaders will begin their own
talks on how best to lure the major leagues to Joe Robbie Stadium,
which would need about $10 million in renovations to accomodate
baseball.
   One option, said Huizenga, is to acquire an existing team. At
present prices, Huizenga's stock in Blockbuster and Waste
Management is worth about $308 million, giving him considerable
financial muscle as a potential buyer.
   However, he'd settle for bidding on an expansion club. Already,
cities such as St. Petersburg, Buffalo and Jacksonville are far
ahead of Miami on lobbying the league for a new team.
   ``If we don't get it on the first round, then during the next
expansion,'' said Huizenga. ``We haven't spoken with anyone
offically yet about anything. The only thing we have going for us
at this point is our drive and enthusiasm.''

   The rapidly rising land prices that hit the Tokyo
area several years ago have spread to Osaka in western Japan and
other regions, the National Land Agency said Thursday.
   Average residential land prices in Japan rose 17 percent last
year, with prices in Osaka jumping 58.6 percent, an agency report
said. Commercial land prices rose an average of 16.7 percent
nationwide, while business properties in Osaka surged 43.9 percent.
   Japan's most expensive commercial land was valued at $23,000 a
square foot in Tokyo's Marunouchi business district and in the
nearby Ginza shopping district, the report said.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu owns a condominium in Japan's most
expensive residential area, Tokyo's Sanbancho in Chiyoda ward,
where land was valued at $7,500 per square foot, the report said.
   The Land Agency said residential land prices in Tokyo slipped an
average of 0.3 percent last year, but commercial land prices in the
capital rose 1.7 percent.
   The report was based on a survey of land prices conducted Jan. 1
at 16,865 spots across the country, the agency said.

   Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth said Thursday he would intervene in a lawsuit filed by
Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass over dividends paid to the Poynter
Institute, a media center that runs the St. Petersburg Times and
other publications.
   Bass's attempt to obtain dividends paid to the institute,
Butterworth said, has the potential to disrupt its funding. He said
he was getting involved because he has the constitutional athority
``to protect the integrity of charitable interests.''
   Andrew Barnes, editor and president of the Times, institute
chairman and chairman and chief executive officer of the Times
Holding Co. and Times Publishing Co., issued a statement saying he
welcomed Butterworth's move.
   A spokesman for the Bass group questioned the state's action.
   ``We are puzzled by the attorney general's announcement,'' said
David Bonderman, a general partner in the Bass venture.
   ``Our longstanding request that Times management act fairly and
in accordance with its legal obligations poses absolutely no threat
to the continuing survival of the Poynter Institute. Nor would our
request in any way interfere with the services provided by the
institute to public high schools and universities or Florida
residents,'' he added.
   Butterworth said he would seek to stop an effort by
Poynter-Jamison Ventures Ltd., an investor partnership controlled
by Bass, to obtain dividends now paid to the non-profit journalism
institute.
   ``The Poynter Institute is unique to Florida and has served our
public high schools and universities, as well as numerous Florida
residents,'' Butterworth said. ``It is important to Florida public
policy to protect charitable institutions from attack by
profiteers.''
   The partnership includes the nieces of the late Eleanor Poynter
Jamison, sister of founder Nelson Poynter. It has made a $270
million buyout offer for Times Publishing Co., parent firm of the
newspaper, Congressional Quarterly and other magazines.
   The Bass group owns 40 percent of the voting stock of Times
Publishing Co. That organization, under the complex stock
arrangement set up by Nelson Poynter, is in turn controlled by the
Times Holding Co., which is controlled by the Poynter Institute.
   Bass maintains it wants a better return on its investment, while
Times Publishing defends the current stock arrangement as
beneficial to the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the
health of the Poynter Institute, which offers education and
national conferences to journalists and students.

   Stock prices finished higher Thursday but off the
day's best level, as a poor early performance on Wall Street set
back a morning advance sparked by favorable British trade figures.
   Dealers sent prices up after the midmorning release of the trade
figures, which showed that Britain's merchandise trade deficit
narrowed sharply to a better-than-expected 1.395 billion pounds, or
$2.23 billion, in February, from a revised deficit of 2.02 billion
pounds, or $3.23 billion, in January.
   But stock prices fell from their peak when New York prices
dropped. By the close of the London session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 20.72 points to 2,707.21.
   Dealers added that investors were waiting for the results of an
election in central England on Thursday to see if the opposition
Labor Party wins control of a once-safe Conservative seat.
   If Labor wins, stocks could suffer setbacks Friday on concern
that the socialist-leaning party might win the next general
election, to be called before mid-1992.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 8.6 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,258.9, off its peak of
2,267.8 but well above its 2,240.7 low.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 7.7 points at 1,779.1
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.51 points
to close at 1,223.87.
   By recent standards, volume was a relatively active 497.8
million shares, compared with 447 million shares Wednesday.

   Share prices on Wall Street were sharply lower
in afternoon trading today following another substantial loss in
the Tokyo stock market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 35.36 points at
2,692.57 at 2 p.m. EST. Declining issues outstripped advances by
around 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,201 issues
down, 303 up and 428 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 121.63 million shares.
   ``It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market,'' said Charles
Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp. ``We've been ignoring
that market for a couple of weeks. You can only ignore reality for
so long.''
   After a break for a national holiday Wednesday, the Tokyo stock
market fell again in chaotic trading today, three days after the
third-worst drop in its history.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 963.85 points, ending
the day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Today's drop puts the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   Dealers blamed the market tumble on the Japanese yen's
continuing erosion against the dollar. The yen's losses come
despite Tuesday's 1 percent rise in Japan's official discount rate
to 5.25 percent, which was intended to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   Traders in the United States also are concerned about company
earnings for the first quarter, due to be reported early next
month, which could show worse-than-expected results that would
depress the value of U.S. stocks.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 2.32 at 184.50.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
fallen 2.70 to 360.45.

   Federal and state grand juries on
Thursday indicted the owners of the defunct Champion Insurance Co.
on forgery and other charges.
   Among the charges is that officials of the company concealed
over $2 million that was provided to Louisiana Insurance
Commissioner Doug Green for use in his 1987 election campaign.
Green was not indicted and has denied any involvement with Champion.
   Attorney General William Guste told reporters the investigation
is continuing.
   The indictments were issued by a state grand jury in Baton Rouge
and federal grand juries in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
   The state grand jury named the entire immediate family of John
Eicher, the principal owner of Champion, on forgery charges.
   In New Orleans, the federal grand jury named Eicher, his son
Naaman and Naaman's wife, Tina, in a 25-count indictment for
alleged mail fraud and conspiracy.

forgery charge, and Don McCulloch, Champion's treasurer, was
indicted for conspiracy to commit theft.
   John and Naaman Eicher and Patti King Eicher were indicted for
filing false public records.
   Guste said, ``Upton and McCulloch are expected to plead guilty.
They will assist us in giving testimony.''
   Guste said the family members allegedly altered bank statements
``to make them look like they had more or less money than they
had.''
   The federal indictment in New Orleans named John, Naaman and
Tina Eicher on 13 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy
to operate Champion for personal benefit.
   The New Orleans federal indictment said the Eichers concealed
the true condition of Champion and continued to sell policies when
they knew the company was intentionally limiting its payment of
outstanding claims.
   It also alleged that the Eichers concealed and destroyed records
to thwart investigations into the failure of the company.
   Naaman Eicher alone was charged with three additional federal
counts of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, and one
count of illegally structuring a financial transaction.
   The Baton Rouge federal indictment cites John and Naaman Eicher
on 19 counts of mail fraud, and Patti Eicher, Tina, Ashley and
Meredith on 11 counts of mail fraud.
   The indictment said the family continued operating the business
on the basis of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations
for personal benefit.
   The Eichers have denied criminal wrongdoing in the company's
collapse.

   The U.S. dollar fell marginally against the major
currencies in what dealers called nervous and volatile European
trading on Thursday.
   Gold prices gained about $1.50 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fluctuated throughout
the day on serious international developments. They cited tension
over Lithuania's demand for independence from Moscow, Romania's
unrest over its Hungarian minority and uncertainty over German
unification.
   The dealers said the fusion of the two German economies, which
could take place this summer, would likely lead to higher costs for
the Bonn government, undermining the traditionally strong West
German mark.
   After four weeks of decline, the British pound gained half a
cent after slightly better than expected trade figures for February.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6015 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.5965.
   Other European late dollar rates compared with Wednesday's late
levels were: 1.7054 West German marks, down from 1.7070; 1.5150
Swiss francs, down from 1.5192; 5.7505 French francs, down from
5.7575; 1.9210 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9230; 1,255.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,257.25; and 1.1757 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1769.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 154.83 yen, up from 154.00
yen late in London Wednesday, when the Tokyo markets were closed
for a holiday.
   Gold bullion prices recovered modestly after falls of more than
$6 an ounce on Wednesday.
   Dealers said the gold price moved slowly in tune with the
dollar's narrow fluctuations on the foreign-exchange market. They
said there was little interest in gold and no news to influence the
price.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid of $393.05 a
troy ounce, up from $391.75. The closing Zurich bid price was
$393.00, up from $391.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at
$392.85 bid, down from $393.65.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.08 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.06.

   James R. Williams, president of the National
Retail Merchants Association for 19 years, has resigned and formed
his own consulting business, it was announced Thursday.
   Williams stepped down as president of the Retail Services
Division of the newly formed National Retail Federation. The

Merchants Association merged with the American Retail Federation.
   There was no immediate word on who would replace Williams.
   Williams said in a news release that his New York-based

that need to know how retailers operate.
   Before joining the trade group, Williams was a retailing
executive and had been president of Williams Bros. Co., a
department store founded by his family.
   He had been responsible for expanding the trade group's
international operations and had an active part in organizing the
World Conference of Retailers, held every two years.
   He has represented the U.S. retailing industry at meetings of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade
monitoring organization, and appeared before congressional
committes, federal agencies and other bodies to present the
retailer's point of view.

   First came the trinkets and toys, then the
cameras, cars, computers and electronics. Now Japan is ready to
take on a remaining bastion of American economic dominance, the
credit card.
   JCB International Credit Card Co. Ltd., the largest Japanese
credit card company, is expanding aggressively in the United States
and plans to peddle the card to American consumers beginning this
summer.
   The effort has jolted U.S. card companies, which are watching
JCB with a mix of awe, curiosity and fear.
   At first, JCB officials say, the card will be offered primarily
to U.S. individuals such as business people who travel extensively
in the Far East, where JCB is the most widely accepted plastic.
They say the card is not intended for a broader U.S. audience, but
aren't ruling out that possibility.
   ``I frankly don't see JCB as a mass card in this country,'' said
Dwayne Krumme, head of JCB's American operation, based in Los
Angeles. ``I think the JCB card will be niche card, at least in the
early years.''
   Krumme, who formerly ran the credit card business of Los
Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, said JCB has held
preliminary discussions with at least three banks in the Midwest
and East about issuing JCB cards in the same way banks issue Visa
and Mastercard.
   He declined to identify the banks but said ``we think we can
work something out with them.''
   JCB already is issuing corporate cards to U.S. businesses and
has negotiated deals with credit-card processing companies for
repayment services. In is accepted by a growing number of American
merchants, from hotels and airlines to swank retailers eager to
encourage spending by wealthy Japanese tourists and business people.
   ``The JCB card, in an international context, is really a travel
and entertainment card,'' said Krumme. ``When it's used for other
purposes, it's an upscale card used at Tiffany's, Chanel and
Gucci's.''
   At least 300,000 American outlets are expected to accept JCB
cards soon, double the present number, JCB officials say.
Worldwide, JCB is accepted by 1.4 million merchants, triple the
number of five years ago.
   JCB's effort to muscle into the U.S. market comes as credit card
companies already are competing intensely. JCB's entry also
reflects Japan's seemingly inexhaustible financial might, an
advantage that some rivals find intimidating.
   ``We think JCB is going to be one of the major competitive
threats of the `90s,'' said Richard Woods, a spokesman for
Mastercard International, accepted by about 8 million merchants
worldwide.
   ``They have deep pockets. They're long-term players. There's no
question they have an interest in providing global payment
services,'' Woods said. ``We're watching them very closely.''
   Visa International, accepted by 7.5 million merchants worldwide,
also is monitoring JCB's forays, said spokesman Richard Brancoli.
But he suggested JCB should be watching its own backyard.
   ``There are 25 million Japanese who have Visa cards,'' Brancoli
said. ``We expect it to increase to 40 million in Japan.''
   JCB stands for Japan Credit Bureau, founded three decades ago by
Sanwa Bank, one of Japan's largest commercial banks. JCB is the
oldest and predominant credit card company in Japan, with about 70
million cards issued.
   The card's biggest threat may be to the American Express card.
Both are charge cards targeted mainly to the same market of
affluent consumers. Users must pay their balance in full each month.
   Visa, Mastercard and the Discover card, issued by retailing
giant Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., are revolving credit cards, targeted to
a much wider income range of consumers. Users do not have to pay
their full balance, but are charged interest on the unpaid portion.
   Steven Richardson, vice president of travel-related services at
American Express, said he didn't consider the JCB card a
significant threat and noted that in Japan, both card companies
have a partnership arrangement. Nonetheless, he said, ``We
obviously look at any new developments in the industry and consider
them all seriously.''
   Credit-card experts speculated that American Express, accepted
by 3 million merchants worldwide, is looking hard at ways to learn
more about the competition.
   ``Obviously the American market is an attractive place,'' said
Bruce Brittain, head of Brittain Associates Inc., an Atlanta-based
consulting firm that does market research on credit-card use.
``They're targeting people with the big bucks.''
   So far JCB's only U.S. offices are in Los Angeles, Chicago, San
Francisco and New York. They are seeking to increase the U.S.
merchant-acceptance base, but also operate as travel centers to
help Japanese cardholders, much like American Express does abroad
for its clients.
   Mitsuo Funayama, New York branch manager, said any rival fears
of a Japanese assault were unfounded.
   ``I'm sure JCB won't be so big in this country,'' he said.

   Share prices on Wall Street tumbled today in the
wake of another big loss in the Tokyo stock market.
   It was the third straight decline on the New York Stock
Exchange, following a vigorous rally in recent weeks.
   ``It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market,'' said Charles
Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp. ``We've been ignoring
that market for a couple of weeks. You can only ignore reality for
so long.''
   After a break for a national holiday Wednesday, the Tokyo stock
market fell again in chaotic trading today, three days after the
third-worst drop in its history.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 963.85 points, ending
the day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Today's drop puts the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   Dealers blamed the market tumble on the Japanese yen's
continuing erosion against the dollar. The yen's losses come
despite Tuesday's 1 percent rise in Japan's official discount rate
to 5.25 percent, which was intended to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   Analysts said the New York market was ripe for a pullback after
its recent advance, and the Japanese debacle exacerbated Wall
Street's retreat.
   ``The market was overextended,'' said Monte Gordon, vice
president and director of research at Dreyfus Corp. ``You would
expect the market to retrace.''
   Last week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained a net
57.89 points to 2,741.22, its highest level since early January.
The advance continued on Monday, as the blue-chip barometer picked
up another 14.41 points. But it stalled in Tuesday's trading and
the retreat was extended Wednesday and today.

   The Blimpie chain of submarine sandwich shops
said Thursday it soon will serve only tuna said to be caught in
ways that do not seriously threaten dolphins.
   Blimpie's new policy states that no store will purchase any tuna
unless it is deemed ``dolphin-safe'' _ caught by means posing only
minimal risk to the marine mammals.
   But an environmental group said it advocates a boycott of all
canned tuna because it knows of no brand available in the United
States containing only dolphin-safe tuna.
   Blimpie, which says its 350 franchised shops served 4{ million
tuna sandwiches last year, will not purchase Yellowfin tuna, the
type associated most closely with harm to dolphins.
   Anthony Conza, president and co-founder of Blimpie's, said the
company began working on the tuna-dolphin issue when it was raised
by various environmental and animal rights groups.
   ``We believe that the fast food consumer will support our
decision to take an environmentally responsible stance,'' he said.
   Blimpie decided against an outright boycott in part because
consumers enjoy tuna sandwiches.
   ``Tuna is a low-fat, high-protein food that is highly
recommended by nutritionists and well-liked by our consumers,''
Conza said. ``It is not our responsibility to make the decision for
the consumer on whether or not to boycott tuna.''
   Food distributors have assured Blimpie that the policy will be
followed, the company said. Most of the stores, which operate in 16
states, will become part of the program by the summer.
   Blimpie already serves Skip Jack tuna from the Philippines in 60
of its Southeastern stores and in 28 of its Houston locations.
   Yellowfin tuna, one of the most commonly used varieties, are
caught with the involuntary help of dolphins. Schools of Yellowfin
swim below dolphins, so tuna fleets, mainly off the coasts of
Southern California and South America, search out dolphins to
locate Yellowfin. The dolphins often are injured or killed as the
Yellowfin are caught.
   Dolphins supposedly do not swim with Skip Jack tuna.
   ``We do applaud the efforts but right now we are focusing on a
canned tuna boycott,'' said Brenda Killian, a national organizer of
the Save the Dolphins Project of San Francisco-based Earth Island
Institute. ``We are in support of any restaurants that are looking
for dolphin-safe tuna and if indeed distributors can guarantee it,
we would like to know.''
   ``As far as we know, there is no canned tuna being sold in the
United States that is 100 percent Skip Jack,'' she added.
   The Save the Dolphins Project plans a nationwide Dolphin Day on
April 14 to highlight the issue.
   Most tuna consumed in the United States is caught by methods
that kill at least 100,000 dolphins each year, Ms. Killian said,
citing biologists' estimates.
   Blimpie is a division of the publicly held Astor Restaurant
Group Inc. of New York. It says it sells about 39 million
sandwiches each year and has systemwide annual sales exceeding $120
million.

<HEAD>Eastern, ALPA Agree to Interim Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its pilots union have agreed
to an interim contract calling for a 25 percent wage cut and
benefit concessions, the company announced Thursday.
   The pact did not resolve the issue of rehiring more of the
pilots who engaged in a sympathy strike with the Machinists union
in March 1989.
   Eastern also insisted it needs twice the amount of concessions
given in the interim pact by the time the contract expires on July
1 to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Time to resolve the dispute ``regrettably has just about run
out, in light of the reorganization timetable,'' said Thomas J.
Matthews, senior vice president of human resources for Eastern,
which is owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern insisted federal mediators would have to continue
efforts to reach a permanent agreement to cut costs further.
   ``If expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an
arrangement, Eastern ... will have to promptly seek bankruptcy
court permission to achieve full cost reductions on a long-term
basis,'' the carrier said in a news release.
   The interim cut applies to Eastern's approximately 850 pilots
still being paid at the pre-strike wage rate of about $72,000.
Eastern had 3,600 union pilots who honored picket lines when the
Machinists went on strike on March 4, 1989. Since then, many pilots
have returned, replacements have been hired at lower wages and the
airline has sold many routes.
   Edward Breen, spokesman for the Eastern Air Line Pilots
Association, contended the company intends to use the temporary
agreement, negotiated with the help of the National Mediation
Board, as a device to crush the union.
   He said that by demanding more concessions in advance, Eastern
hoped to push the talks into a final impasse.
   Breen said ALPA executives had agreed in principle to the
contract, but it would not be signed until after a formal vote of
the Master Executive Committee on Saturday in Washington.
   The 25 percent wage cuts exclude about 950 replacement pilots
hired at an average $27,500 when the strike began.
   The new wage levels are among the lowest in the country for
major carriers, Breen said.
   ``An Eastern pilot after this will make about 50 percent of what
a United Airlines pilot makes _ and they still can't make a
profit,'' he said.
   Eastern lost $282.6 million in the last quarter of 1989,
bringing total losses for the year to $852.3 million. Overall,
Houston-based Texas Air lost $885.6 million.
   The interim agreement also calls for a reduction in the
airline's contribution to the pilots' pension plan, increased pilot
contributions to their medical and dental insurance, and the
preservation of tougher work rules in effect since the strike.
   Eastern's ALPA contract expired in June 1988, but its provisions
had remained in effect. Federal mediators have guided negotiations
since September, although Eastern said the two sides have been
consulting regularly for 33 months.
   Under Eastern's reorganization plan, pilots will have to reduce
their wages and benefits to the same degree as other employees,
Matthews said.

<HEAD>Judge Accepts Conditional Pleas From Development Company,
Executives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday delayed accepting a
guilty plea from General Development Corp. and ordered an
independent expert to review a plan to monitor the company and
repay thousands of people allegedly overcharged for its homes.
   U.S. District Judge Lenore Nesbitt gave conditional acceptance
to guilty pleas from the Miami-based home builder and two former
executives pending review of pre-sentencing reports.
   General Development, former President Robert Ehrling and former
Chairman David Brown were named last week in a 16-count indictment
alleging a seven-year scheme to sell overvalued homes at its nine
Florida communities.
   The indictment claims the company priced homes well above
comparable residences in Florida and kept prospective buyers from
learning about the difference. Most of the General Development
customers were Northeast and Midwest residents brought to Florida
on heavily subsidized trips.
   Reading from prepared statements in court, both Ehrling and
Brown apologized and admitted their knowledge of the price-hike
scheme. The company allegedly sold 10,000 overpriced homes for $850
million from 1982 to 1989.
   ``I am truly sorry I did not take action sooner, and I'm sorry
for the customers who were misled,'' said Brown.
   Under the plea agreement with federal prosecutors, the two
executives and the company would plead guilty to one fraud count,
while the 15 additional counts would be dismissed. Charges against
GDV Financial Corp., a General Development subsidiary that provided
mortgages and financial aid to homeowners, would be dropped, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Moscowitz.
   If Ms. Nesbitt accepts the guilty pleas from Brown, 49, and
Ehrling, 50, each could face up to five years in prison, a $250,000
fine and restitution payments. Sentencing is scheduled for May 22.
   Brown and Ehrling were making $600,000 a year each before they
were forced out by General Development directors March 9 after the
company disclosed it was facing indictment.
   General Development's estimated $100 million, 25-year
restitution program is detailed in a civil consent decree that
prosecutors expect to file within the next week.
   Ms. Nesbitt said she wants an expert, perhaps a former trustee
of a dissolved corporation, to review the consent decree ``for its
feasibility.''
   ``I don't want to accept something now and be locked in,'' she
said.
   A hearing on the consent decree is scheduled for April 3.
   The company also could face a maximum $500,000 fine for its
guilty plea.
   In court, Moscowitz said General Development priced its homes an
average of 40 percent higher than market value, and lot prices were
inflated by up to 10 times. Up to half of the General Development
homebuyers were from the New York metropolitan area, he said.
   The indictment also alleges General Development kept customers
from learning about other homes prices in Florida by assigning a
sales representatives to stay with the people constantly and even
to screen their calls in some cases.
   The 35-year-old company has sold or has available 350,000 lots
in Florida and also operates a time-share resort near Walt Disney
World, a recreational community in Tennessee and 10 time-share
resorts in the West.
   General Development recently laid off 5,500 workers _ about 10
percent of its work force _ and shut sales offices in Hollywood,
Fla., and Boston.
   The company is also the target of several class-action suits
involving thousands of homebuyers alleging overpricing.
   In Delaware Chancery Court, a General Development shareholder
filed suit last week seeking a court order to nominate three
candidates to the board of directors in May and three others in
1991.
   General Development claims New York-based United Capital Corp.,
which owns about 12.7 percent of its outstanding shares, missed the
filing deadline for this year's corporate elections and that
directors can appoint people to the 1991 vacancies.
   The Delaware suit alleges Brown persuaded United Capital
Chairman Attilio Petrocelli to sign a letter dropping the proxy
slate in exchange for permission to acquire up to 20 percent of
General Development stock. But Brown failed to disclose the
company's financial problems and the pending indictments, the suit
alleges.
   The suit seeks to nullify the agreement and restore United
Capital's proxy slate.

<HEAD>Italian Senate Approves Media Antitrust Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian Senate on Thursday passed a bill that
would restrict ownership of television and newspapers, and ban
commercials during film, opera and theater productions on
television.
   The measure is seen as a major threat to the television empire
of Italian media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi.
   The bill, approved by a show of hands in the Senate, must be
considered next week by the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of
Parliament.
   The TV law would prevent those who own more than 16 percent of
Italy's total newspaper circulation from owning a television
station. Those who control from 8 percent to 16 percent of the
circulation would be restricted to just one television station and
those who own up to 8 percent of the circulation could own two
stations. Someone who does not own a newspaper could own up to
three television stations.
   Italy is the only European nation without a law regulating
television ownership.
   Under the bill, Berlusconi could be forced to give up one of his
three TV stations or his newspapers.
   The Rome daily La Repubblica, which Berlesconi controls through
his acquisition of Mondadori Editore, estimated he could lose up to
$320 million a year in advertising if the amendment on commercials
passes.
   Gianni Letta, a spokesman for Berlusconi's holding company
Fininvest, said Wednesday that approval of the amendment ``would
mean the end of commercial television in Italy to the advantage of
a monopoly by (state-run) RAI.''
   The state-run television carries advertising but mainly between
shows.

   Southland Corp., with its announcement Thursday
that it was selling out to a Japanese firm, became the latest
company forced to seek outside help after being swamped by
leveraged buyout debt.
   The parent of 7,000 7-Eleven convenience stores said it was
selling a controlling interest to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd., Japan's
second-largest supermarket operator and a partner in the $4.9
billion buyout of Southland in 1987, for $400 million and the
assumption of Southland's debt.
   Southland joined the growing ranks of companies such as Campeau
Corp., Revco D.S. Inc. and Doskocil Cos. that were unable to handle
the large debt bills run up in takeover deals.
   Their stories have common elements: A debt-financed buyout made
during the rosy days of the 1980s takeover binge. Disappointing
sales and earnings that can't support massive interest payments.
Assets put up for sale to bring in desperately-needed cash.
   Economists are predicting that as time goes on, more companies
will find themselves in similar straits, especially if the already
slowing economy takes a downturn.
   Finding an outside investor, as Southland has done, is one
option a struggling company has for getting out of trouble. The
infusion of cash and assumption of debt brings an immediate end to
the financial crisis, but the price, in this case a loss of
corporate control, can be high.
   For other companies _ including Revco, Campeau and Doskocil _
the answer has been bankruptcy court protection.
   Revco, one of the country's biggest drugstore chains, went
private in a $1.5 billion junk bond-financed buyout in 1986. It was
the first big leveraged buyout to fail, and Revco is selling
hundreds of stores as it reorganizes.
   Campeau was unable to handle a $7 billion debt load after buying
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., again
with high-interest junk bond financing. When news of the company's
troubles broke in September, it set off a plunge in the junk bond
market and helped bring the debt-financed takeover boom to an end.
   Campeau placed the store businesses in bankruptcy court in
January.
   Doskocil, a food processing company, defaulted on a $133 million
loan after taking over the much larger Wilson Foods Corp. Doskocil
has been unable to find a buyer for assets it has tried to sell,
and the higher prices it has been forced to pay for raw materials
has left it short of cash.
   The company sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors
earlier this month.
   All of these companies, when they went heavily into debt,
indicated they could handle the payments. But the economy has
slowed, profits have fallen and interest rates have moved higher,
leaving some highly-leveraged operations in a bind.
   Retailers have been particularly vulnerable, as several of tese
firms illustrate. The retail industry has been in a slump for
several years, and an expected improvement never materialized. What
looked like a great investment two years ago is today's bad deal.
   Some economists have warned the economy eventually could run
into trouble because of highly-leveraged businesses.
   Companies that do business with financially-distressed concerns
may find they aren't being paid for merchandise they have shipped,
or aren't receiving as many orders. They may have to cut back, and
possibly lay off workers, as a result.
   Furthermore, a company strapped by debt could be limited in its
ability to compete and might lose market share to other concerns,
including foreign businesses. A drop in market share means less
demand for a companies' products _ which also can mean lost jobs.

<HEAD>Shawmut Revises Earnings To Beef Up Reserves Against Bad Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shawmut National Corp. has revised its 1989
earnings after an examination by federal bank regulators, posting a
$129 million loss for the year instead of a previously announced
$200 million profit.
   The bank revised its fourth-quarter statement to reflected a
$327 million loss instead of a $3.9 million profit. It also
announced Wednesday that it had lowered its dividend per share to
25 cents from 36 cents.
   The revision was another sign of the troubles facing banks
because of the slumping real estate market. Examinations of real
estate lending led to a $1.1 billion loss at Bank of New England
Corp. earlier this year.
   Investors seemed unconcerned by Shawmut's move, which could be
viewed as protecting the bank against future problems. Shawmut
stock gained 37{ cents Thursday to close at $15.25 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Shawmut, one of New England's largest banking companies, said
bad loans for the fourth quarter jumped sharply, to $123.4 million
from $46.4 million.
   After the review by federal regulators, Shawmut, which is based
in Boston and Hartford and has more than 400 branches, said it
nearly doubled the size of its reserves for loan losses at the end
of 1989 to $739 million from $383 million.
   Bank examiners convinced Shawmut to post the loss. Shawmut had
called in 180 examiners from three federal agencies in a
confidence-building effort after federal officials gave both Bank
of New England and Bank of Boston poor marks.
   Examinations of New England banks have drawn fire, with bank
officials accusing the examiners of being excessively harsh after
failing to nip the savings and loan crisis in the bud.
   Shawmut chairman and chief executive officer Joel Alvord said
the examiners had not changed the regulations but were ``calling
the plays a little tighter.''
   ``When you see clouds on the horizon, you carry an umbrella,''
Alvord said. ``We may see showers, but others might see storm
clouds or a torrential downpour.''
   Shawmut also said it expected a $40 million first-quarter 1990
profit, but that the figured would include $56 million in one-time
gains and tax benefits.
   News of the revision prompted both Standard and Poor's Corp. and
Fitch Investors Service Inc. to lower their credit ratings of the
bank's senior debt issues to take the greater risk into account.

   Assets of the nation's 505 money market mutual
funds rose $199.04 million to an all-time record of $391.23 billion
in the latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise broke the previous record of $391.03 billion set a week
earlier. That record originally was reported as $390.79 billion but
was revised upward by the Washington-based trade group to reflect
the inclusion of four new funds.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 247
general purpose funds fell $968.9 million to $132.57 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $637.0 million to
$166.78 billion, and assets of 156 institutional funds rose $530.9
million to $91.88 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.67 percent from 7.65 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.65 percent from 7.64 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.25 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from the previous week.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged. Yields
were 8.01 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.97 percent; 8.01 percent
on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.96 percent; and 8.06 percent on 5-year
CDs, up from 8.03 percent.

<HEAD>Change in Corporate Culture for New Microsoft President</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday PMs report</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A change of corporate culture is in store for
Michael Hallman, who is trading the presidency of Boeing Computer
Services for the same job at Microsoft Corp.
   Boeing is nearing its 75th anniversary; Microsoft was founded in
the mid-1970s. Boeing deals with everything from fax machines to
fluid dynamics models; Microsoft focuses on computer software.
   Boeing has airplane models expected to be in development or use
for 50 to 70 years; the software industry has to react to sudden
market changes.
   ``It's going to be a fun place to work,'' Hallman said in an
interview Tuesday. ``It's a place where you can work hard, be
successful and have fun doing it.''
   Hallman, 44, was named earlier this week by Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 34-year-old billionaire chairman and chief executive,
to succeed Jon A. Shirley, who retires June 30. Hallman will join
Microsoft April 2.
   Hallman, who also will be chief operating officer, described his
new job as overseeing day-to-day operations while company founder
Gates provides overall product and development direction.
   The key, he said, will be to help Microsoft cope with ``the
realities that rapid growth and large size create, but at the same
time ensure there's the entrepreneurial spirit and environment that
has kept the creativity flowing there.''
   Microsoft has about 5,000 employees and is expected to hit $1
billion in sales in 1990. Its operating system software for IBM
personal computers and compatibles is the industry standard.
Microsoft also leads in applications software such as word
processing programs and programming languages.
   At Boeing Computer Services, Hallman directed about 13,000
employees and a Boeing Co. division that does more than $1 billion
in business a year.
   About two-thirds of the division's work is for Boeing, but
selling computer time and its expertise in data management and
telecommunications brought about $360 million in sales last year.
   BCS handles information management for all Boeing divisions,
writes software and develops technologies such as artificial
intelligence and computer-aided design and manufacturing.
   It operates about $1.3 billion worth of computer gear, including
a state-of-the-art Cray supercomputer. It also has one of the
world's largest private telecommunications networks, linking six
major data centers nationwide.
   And its customers include large corporations and the federal
government _ the sort Microsoft also would like.
   ``I think that's an area where my background would lend itself
well,'' Hallman said.
   Besides selling to such customers, Hallman also brings the
perspective of an individual computer operator _ he has three in
his home _ and a large, corporate computer user. Boeing Computer
was in charge of acquiring the company's 43,000 personal computers
and the software for them.
   Hallman does not foresee Microsoft switching its emphasis on
desktop computers used by individuals and small businesses, but he
said the 1990s will see more personal computers linked in networks
and with large mainframes. Microsoft's products will need to
reflect that, he said.
   Hallman joined Boeing three years ago after spending 20 years at
International Business Machines Corp., much of that in sales and
marketing. He ran Boeing Computer's outside sales until he was
named president in November 1987.
   Microsoft spokesman Marty Taucher said Hallman's compensation
would be comparable to that of Shirley, who made $315,000 a year,
according to Microsoft's 1989 proxy statement.
   Hallman said he was approached by Microsoft about the
president's job last fall, with contact accelerating after Shirley
formally announced his retirement earlier this year.
   In recent weeks, Hallman said he spent a lot of time with Gates
and other Microsoft senior executives, discussing the job and
``making sure the chemistry was right.''
   ``Bill and I get along great,'' Hallman said. ``I think the
facts are we share the same enthusiasm and passion and vision for
where this technology is going to go.''
   Hallman added that the change in corporate history and style
from Boeing to Microsoft would be an advantage. ``It would be a
mistake to bring someone in who had exactly the same view because
no value would be added there,'' he said.

   The dollar declined against most major
currencies except the sagging Japanese yen Thursday as a weak
showing on Wall Street unsettled investors.
   Gold prices gained in domestic and overseas dealing.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery
settled at $394 a troy ounce, up $2.20 from Wednesday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $394 for a troy
ounce of gold, $2.10 higher than Wednesday's late bid.
   Dealers said cross trading involving sales of Japanese yen and
purchases of West German marks dominated activity in the currency
markets.
   ``People were watching the Dow Jones but I don't think that was
the most important factor in the foreign exchange markets,'' said

in New York.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled 32.21
points to 2,695.72, closing above its worst levels of the day.
Stock traders said the selloff was a belated reaction to the
profound weakness this year in the Tokyo exchange.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost
963.85 points earlier Thursday, ending the day at 29,843.34. The
drop put the Nikkei's loss so far this year at 23 percent, or
9,072.53 points.
   Sales of dollars to collect profits made during its recent
strong performance also weighed down the currency.
   European dealers reported earlier that the dollar fluctuated in
response to international developments. Tension over Lithuania's
demand for independence from Moscow, Romania's unrest over its
Hungarian minority and uncertainty over German unification all
influenced currency trading.
   After four weeks of decline, the British pound regained some
lost ground after the government reported slightly better than
expected trade figures for February.
   One British pound was quoted at $1.6040 late in New York,
stronger than late Wednesday's level of $1.5955. In London, one
British pound cost $1.6015 late Thursday, more expensive for buyers
than Wednesday's late $1.5965.
   One dollar bought 155.105 Japanese yen late Thursday in New
York, up from 154.365 yen late Wednesday. Earlier in Tokyo the
dollar closed at 154.83 yen, up from 154.00 yen late Wednesday in
London, when the Tokyo markets were closed for a holiday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Wednesday, included: 1.7028 West German marks, down from 1.7100;
1.5120 Swiss francs, down from 1.5225; 5.7415 French francs, down
from 5.768; 1,255.50 Italian lire, down from 1,259.75; and 1.17575
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17875.
   Dollar rates in late European compared with Wednesday included:
1.7054 West German marks, down from 1.7070; 1.5150 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5192; 5.7505 French francs, down from 5.7575; 1.9210
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9230; 1,255.50 Italian lire, down from
1,257.25; and 1.1757 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1769.
   Gold bullion prices recovered modestly after falls of more than
$6 an ounce on Wednesday. Silver posted minor gains.
   In London, the major European precious metals market, gold
closed at a bid of $393.05 a troy ounce, up from $391.75. The
closing Zurich bid price was $393.00, up from $391.50. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold closed at $392.85 bid, down from $393.65.
   In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.084
a troy ounce compared to Wednesday's settlement of $5.055. Silver
bullion traded late in London at $5.08 bid a troy ounce, up from
$5.06.

<HEAD>Former MTV Developer Named To Head Time Warner Enterprises Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Thursday that Robert W.
Pittman, who oversaw the creation of the MTV cable television
network nearly a decade ago, has been appointed to head Time
Warner's business development division.
   Pittman, 36, was named president and chief executive of Time
Warner Enterprises, and will be involved in strategic and business
development as well as in entrepreneurial ventures.
   In a telephone interview, Pittman said his job would be to
``take advantage of assets we already have in place'' and look for
new ways ``to keep our company growing and expanding'' both
domestically and internationally.
   Pittman said he was the original head of programming for MTV:
Music Television, the music cable network that debuted in 1981
under the ownership of what was then called Warner Amex Satellite
Entertainment Co.
   Warner Amex was a joint venture of Warner Communications Inc.
and American Express Co.
   At Warner Amex, he was also instrumental in developing The Movie
Channel, a pay-television service.
   From 1983 to 1985, Pittman served as chief operating officer of
MTV. Pittman was part of a group that unsuccessfully tried to buy
MTV in 1985 but lost out to a bid by Viacom Inc.
   Pittman stayed on for two years after the buyout as president
and chief executive on MTV Networks, the successor company to
Warner Amex that operates the MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite and
VH-1 cable networks.
   In 1987, he co-founded with MCA Inc. a company called Quantum
Media Inc. which created and produced TV programs and made
investments in media properties.
   That company was acquired in September for an undisclosed price
by Time Warner, which itself was formed last year when Time Inc.
bought Warner Communications. Pittman then became an executive
adviser at Time Warner.
   Steven J. Ross, a co-chairman and co-chief executive of Time
Warner, said in a statement, ``We've had a long and productive
relationship with Bob.''
   During Pittman's tenure as chief operating officer and chief
executive at MTV Networks, the company was ``the most profitable
basic-cable network in the country at that time. We're delighted to
welcome him back,'' Ross said.
   Pittman joins Arthur R. Barron, a former Paramount
Communications Inc. executive, at the helm of Time Warner
Enterprises. Barron, 55, was named chairman of Time Warner
Enterprises in February.
   ``I have known Bob Pittman and admired his creative talents for
several years,'' Barron was quoted as saying in a news release. ``I
look forward to working alongside Bob in expanding Time Warner's
business.''

   Share prices on Wall Street tumbled Thursday in
the wake of another big loss in the Tokyo stock market.
   It was the third straight decline on the New York Stock
Exchange, following a vigorous rally in recent weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 32.21 points to
2,695.72, breaching the key psychological level of 2,700. The
blue-chip barometer was down more than 40 at one point in the
afternoon.
   Declining issues outstripped advancing ones by around 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,200 down, 368 up
and 409 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 175.93 million
shares, up from 130.99 million in Wednesday's session.
   ``It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market,'' said Charles
Jensen, an analyst for MKI Securities Corp. ``We've been ignoring
that market for a couple of weeks. You can only ignore reality for
so long.''
   After a break for a national holiday Wednesday, the Tokyo stock
market fell again in chaotic trading Thursday, three days after the
third-worst drop in its history.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 963.85 points, ending
the day at 29,843.34, its lowest closing since Dec. 24, 1988.
Thursday's drop puts the Nikkei's losses so far this year at 23
percent, or 9,072.53 points.
   Dealers blamed the market tumble on the Japanese yen's
continuing erosion against the dollar. The yen's losses occurred
despite Tuesday's 1 percent rise in Japan's official discount rate
to 5.25 percent, which was intended to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   Analysts said the New York market was ripe for a pullback after
its recent advance, and the Japanese debacle exacerbated Wall
Street's retreat.
   ``The market was overextended,'' said Monte Gordon, vice
president and director of research at Dreyfus Corp. ``You would
expect the market to retrace.''
   Last week, the Dow Jones average gained a net 57.89 points to
2,741.22, its highest level since early January. The advance
continued on Monday, as the average picked up another 14.41 points.
But it stalled in Tuesday's trading and the retreat was extended
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The declines in New York haven't been as severe as those
wrenching the Tokyo market, however. While the Nikkei average lost
3.13 percent Thursday, for example, its Dow Jones counterpart
finished 1.18 percent lower.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Express
dropped 1&lsqb; to 26|, General Electric was down } at 63&rsqb;, AT&amp;T lost {
at 41&rsqb; and Citicorp declined &rsqb; to 23|.
   Boeing was up &lsqb; at 71\, Ford Motor jumped { to 48{ and Beverly
was unchanged at 4&rsqb;.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 211.00 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $36.19 billion, or 0.44
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.12 to 184.70.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.67 to 389.56, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.05 at 335.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 4.79 to 434.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.67 at 360.48.

   A jury on Thursday acquitted Exxon
Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood of being drunk and reckless in
connection with the nation's worst oil spill but convicted him of a
minor charge of negligent discharge of oil.
   After deliberating for just 10{ hours, the jurors absolved
Hazelwood of one felony and two misdemeanor counts stemming from
the disaster, in which his tanker ran aground, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989.
   The misdemeanor charge on which he was convicted carries a
maximum sentence of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, far less
than the 7\ years and $61,000 fine he could have faced if found
guilty on all four charges.
   There were bursts of applause in the court room as Superior
Court Judge Karl Johnstone read the first three verdicts of ``not
guilty.''
   Johnstone said he would set a sentencing date later in the day.
   Hazelwood's New York lawyer, Michael Chalos, a former classmate
of Hazelwood's at the Maritime Academy at Fort Schuyler, N.Y.,
clapped the skipper on the shoulder and hit the counsel table with
his hand at the first ``Not guilty'' verdict.
   The normally taciturn defendant smiled broadly for the first
time in the two-month-long trial and commented briefly to
reporters, saying only, ``I'm just relieved. I was nervous.''
   ``We think it's a great victory for Captain Hazelwood,'' Chalos
said. ``We had great faith in the jury system. The only charge he's
been convicted of is a low-level misdemeanor.''
   One of the jurors said he found unbelievable the prosecution's
complicated effort to prove Hazelwood was intoxicated through
backward calculations. The skipper's blood was not tested until
long after the disaster, and juror Jeff Sage said he and the other
panelists figured out that from the prosecution expert's
calculations, the captain would have had to consume an enormous
amount of liquor before his ship ran aground.
   ``If Hazelwood's an average Joe and you figured backwards the
way he said, it's clear he'd have to be dead'' from the alcohol,
Sage said.
   ``The jury felt there were just too many variables to pinpoint
whether he was drunk at all,'' Sage said. But he said the panel
concluded that Hazelwood was negligent to leave the bridge of his
ship during an icy transit.
   ``To this day, we're never going to know exactly what caused the
accident,'' Sage said. But he found no fault in the state's
decision to try the skipper on criminal charges.
   ``I think that someone had to be tried,'' he said, ``and he's
the captain. He was in charge.''
   After a year of accusations against faceless villains _ Exxon
and oil-related agencies _ the Hazelwood trial provided a human
side to the Exxon Valdez calamity, focusing on frailties of captain
and crew.
   Although 150 civil suits were filed and Exxon was indicted in
federal court, Hazelwood was the only individual charged
criminally. His lawyers complained he was a ``scapegoat'' in a
disaster with many culprits.
   His trial in Anchorage Superior Court had the elements of an
engrossing sea story with a dark subplot involving liquor, troubled
crew members and a star-crossed captain whose battles with the
bottle were well known.
   But the skipper, who had been painted as a liquor swigging
brigand, turned out to be a quiet figure intent on nothing more
than blending into the woodwork. He sat back, stroking his beard,
while others addressed the trial's key questions: Was the skipper
drunk on duty and was he reckless to leave the ship's bridge?
   Whether Hazelwood was drunk when his ship grounded remained a
muddled issue because authorities failed to do a timely blood
alcohol test. When they got around to it 10{ hours after the
grounding, Hazelwood had a .061 alcohol reading, lower than the
Alaska standard of .10 for drunken driving.
   A prosecution expert witness tried to calculate backward and
concluded that Hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of .14 when
the ship grounded. But defense experts ridiculed the figures as
``nonsense,'' saying results could not be conclusive because there
was too long a wait before the test and too many variables,
including whether Hazelwood drank after the grounding.
   Hazelwood, who chose not to testify, never explained.
   In six weeks of testimony, witnesses came forward to tell what
they knew of the day the Exxon Valdez and Hazelwood sailed into
history.
   It was the Thursday before Good Friday, and the tanker had
pulled into its namesake port of Valdez to pick up a load of oil.
Hazelwood went ashore for lunch with two crew members and a local
pilot; they remember that he sipped iced tea. Then they separated
to do shopping.
   Later in the day _ the hour remained in dispute _ Hazelwood met
with his pals at the Pipeline Club, a bar where they said he drank
three vodkas in about three hours. A woman patron of the club, wife
of a Coast Guard investigator in the case, placed Hazelwood there
much earlier, drinking for seven hours. But her testimony never was
corroborated.
   On the way back to the ship, the men stopped and bought pizza
for the crew, and Hazelwood had another drink, either beer or vodka.
   When they arrived at the Valdez terminal about 8:20 p.m., they
learned that the sailing time, originally set for 10 p.m., had been
moved up to 9 p.m. The prosecution would maintain that Hazelwood's
tardiness in boarding his ship showed recklessness.
   Was the skipper intoxicated? He showed no signs of it. During
the trial not a single witness said he appeared drunk.
   ``Did he stagger?'' defense attorneys would ask. ``Did he slur
his words?'' Inevitably, the answers were, ``No.''
   Pilot William Murphy, who guided the tanker through the Valdez
Narrows, said he noticed a trace of alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
After a half-hour on the bridge, he said the skipper went below and
remained there for an hour. When Murphy left the ship at about
10:30 p.m., he conferred with Hazelwood: ``I reminded him there was
ice reported ahead.''
   The crucial period, recounted repeatedly in testimony, began at
11:53 p.m. when Hazelwood decided to leave the bridge in control of
third mate Gregory Cousins after discussing maneuvers that would
take the Exxon Valdez out of shipping lanes to avoid ice, then turn
back to the lanes before leaving Prince William Sound.
   ``He asked if I felt comfortable with what we were going to do
and I said, `Yes,' recalled Cousins. ``He said, `Do you feel
comfortable enough that I can go below and get rid of some
paperwork?' I said I felt very comfortable.''
   The prosecution would note that Cousins did not have the special
endorsement Hazelwood had for piloting in Prince William Sound, a
license the defense claimed was mere formality and had been waived
by the Coast Guard.
   At the helm was Robert Kagan, a seaman who had problems with
steering in the past. Many witnesses would blame Kagan for ramming
the oil-filled tanker into a charted reef.
   Cousins said he ordered Kagan to make a 10-degree right rudder
turn, a routine order. But he failed to check until it was too late
to see if the turn had been made. By then, the Exxon Valdez was
steaming toward Bligh Reef.
   Ten minutes after Hazelwood left the bridge, Cousins glanced at
the rudder indicator and, ``I could tell we hadn't turned. ... I
think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the command.''
   Cousins called Hazelwood in his cabin.
   ``I told him that we were getting into serious trouble ...,''
the third mate recalled. ``That was then we suffered the first
shock and we were hard aground.''
   Deep holes were gashed in the ship's underbelly. It was impaled
on a rock the size of a Volkswagen, and warm oil was bubbling into
the cold, clear waters of Prince William Sound. In all, the ship
belched out nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude
oil in a hemorrhage that killed countless birds, fish and wildlife
on the richly populated sound. The rocky shore turned black for
hundreds of miles.
   One issue which consumed half the trial was whether Hazelwood,
in the frantic moments after grounding, tried to drive his ship off
the reef. He denied it, but prosecutors tried to show he risked
capsizing the tanker and killing the crew.
   The issue became moot when the defense proved the ship was
immovable, and the judge agreed Hazelwood could not be convicted of
trying something that was impossible.

<HEAD>State Joins Union, Managers to Buy Strike-Torn Gunmaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Connecticut on Thursday
joined with striking workers, managers and private investors to buy
the firearms division of Colt Industries, giving the 154-year-old
gunmaker new life after a bitter, four-year strike.
   State Treasurer Francisco L. Borges said the state would put up
$25 million from pension funds for a 47 percent stake in a newly
created company to be called Colt's Manufacturing Company.
   ``Let me emphasize that this is a carefully thought out,
carefully structured, potentially very profitable business
venture,'' Borges said. ``The state's participation is not a
bailout, not a handout, and not a subsidy.''
   Union members, white-collar workers and investors also will hold
stakes in the company, which Colt Industries decided to sell in
order to concentrate on its larger aerospace, automotive and
industrial services businesses.
   The new company's first official act was to write a check for
$10 million in back pay for 1,050 workers who had been on strike
since Jan. 24, 1986. About 50 striking workers applauded when the
company produced the check at a news conference in Borges' office.
   Under terms of the buyout, the company will pay a total of $13
million in back wages to settle an unfair labor practices lawsuit
brought by the United Auto Workers union against Colt Industries in
the wake of the strike.
   Strikers will be put back to work based on seniority. In
addition to back pay they will receive a 13 percent wage increase
and a stock plan that will allow United Auto Workers members to own
11.5 percent of the stock in the new company.
   In return for the back pay, the UAW dropped its lawsuit against
Colt Industries for unfair labor practices.
   The National Labor Relations Board said the settlement was the
largest in its 55-year history, topping a $12 million settlement in
1979 to chemical plant workers in Westwego, La.
   Salaried workers will own about 12 percent of the shares in
Colt's Manufacturing, while the investor group C.F. Holding Corp.
will own about 12 percent, said Antony Autorino, chairman of C.F.
Holding Corp.
   Colt Industries put the firearms division up for sale 11 months
ago. At the time, the division was ravaged by a three-year-old
strike, and had just lost the contract to produce M-16 rifles for
the U.S. Department of Defense.
   With no buyer in sight, the striking workers won a major victory
in September 1989 when an NLRB administrative law judge ruled the
strike was caused by Colt's unfair labor practices. The judge
ordered the company to reinstate the workers and pay them lost
wages estimated as high as $40 million.
   In November, C.F. Holding announced it had agreed to buy the
firearms division. There was no mention at the time of union or
state participation, although both were expected to be part of a
final agreement.
   Borges said Thursday his office had fully investigated the
firearms division and the firearms industry and concluded the
business was a good investment for the state.
   Borges said he knew of no other instance in which labor,
management and public and private investors joined to preserve a
company as big as Colt's firearms division.
   He described the deal as a ``bold, exciting and very inventive
partnership in the best tradition of Samuel Colt's entrepreneurial
spirit.''
   Colt was founded in 1836 in Hartford by Samuel Colt, inventor of
the first successful repeating pistol. After Colt's death in 1862,
the company developed the six-shooter that almost every cowboy
carried _ the legendary gun that won the West.
   In addition to the M-16, the standard Army-issue rifle, Colt
makes the Colt 45 handgun, the King Cobra magnum revolver and the
AR-15 rifle.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Drop As Labor Tensions Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell from five-month highs Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange in response to an easing of labor
tensions in Canada and Peru and a sharp drop in stock prices.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced, grains and
soybeans were mixed; cocoa futures surged; sugar retreated; energy
futures fell; and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
   Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 3.5 cents lower with the
contract for spot delivery at $1.291 a pound.
   Copper futures had surged as much as 4.6 cents Wednesday on
speculation that union workers at a Noranda Inc. copper smelter in
Canada's Quebec province would reject management's final contract
offer, setting the stage for a strike.
   But workers approved the contract by a narrow margin, and
reports of the results early Thursday morning gave the copper
market its initial downward shove.
   Later in the morning, the port workers union in Peru announced
it had ended a nationwide strike after two days, freeing Peruvian
copper exports to move again.
   A miners strike against Southern Peru Copper Corp., the
country's largest copper producer, continued into its 11th day but
analysts said the company had copper stockpiled against the strike
and had not yet broken any shipping commitments.
   ``What threw a monkey wrench into it was the dockworkers
strike,'' said James Steel, a metals analyst with the commodities
brokerage Refco Inc. ``That kind of worried everybody, the fact
they couldn't get it out.''
   The strike against Southern Peru Copper is threatening to
spread, though, with a national miners work stoppage set for
Monday. And analysts are increasingly speculating that the company
will soon declare force majeure on shipping commitments. Declaring
force majeure means a company cannot be held to a contract due to
circumstances beyond its control.
   Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 32 points
Thursday, prompting further selling in the copper market. Because
copper is used heavily in construction and industrial production,
copper prices are extremely sensitive to economic signals.
   Gold and silver futures rose moderately on the Commodity
Exchange, boosted mainly by the dollar's weakness against most
other major currencies.
   Gold settled $2 to $2.20 higher with April at $394.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 2.9 cents higher with March at
$5.084.
   Soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade on strength in the soybean meal market. Wheat futures
retreated while corn advanced.
   The markets displayed only slight interest in news that U.S. and
Soviet negotiators had reached tentative agreement on a new
five-year grain pact increasing to 10 million metric tons from 9
million the amount of U.S. grain the Soviet Union is obligated to
buy each year.
   ``I think it was pretty much expected,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc., a brokers advisory service
in Chicago.

by technical signals. Further buying in the cocoa market was linked
to news that the International Cocoa Organization is likely to vote
Monday on a two-year extension of a price-support agreement,

<HEAD>GM Puts Incentives on New Minivans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s new line of three minivans
was dumped into the incentive pool for the first time Thursday as
the automaker offered $1,000 in cash rebates on the vehicles.
   GM officials said the front-wheel-drive minivans _ sold as the
Chevrolet Lumina APV, the Pontiac Trans Sport and the Oldsmobile
Silhouette _ were selling well, but needed the incentives anyway.
   ``We could see that there is a need in today's market to have
incentives on just about anything,'' said Pontiac spokesman Ed
Lechtzin. ``Because people are coming in and like the vehicle, but
look at the price and say, `How much (rebate) money am I getting?'''
   Lechtzin said there was some concern that production at the sole
plant producing the minivans may outpace demand. But Oldsmobile
spokesman Ross Ruehle said the sales demand is a little stronger
than anticipated for the Silhouette.
   ``I have heard that they are selling relatively well,'' said
senior economist Tom Webb of the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLean, Va. When asked why GM would offer a rebate
on something selling well he said: ``Good question.''
   Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox Chevrolet in Chattanooga, Tenn.,
said he suspected months ago that GM would offer incentives on the
minivans when production at the North Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly
plant reached a certain level, mainly because consumers expected
them.
   The company is increasing production at the plant, which is
expected to produce about 175,000 vans this year and about 225,000
next year.
   The new minivans went on sale last October. Since then, GM has
sold 30,891 of the them, with the Chevrolet model making up more
than half. The new incentives became effective Thursday and run
until May 2.
   Chrysler Corp., whose minivan sales command more than half of
the vehicle's market segment, offered rebates on the vans for the
first time between last Dec. 15 and Jan. 31.
   Sales of the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town
and Country soared during the incentive period. Since then, the
minivan sales pace has dropped.
   ``What we think is we have been out there trying to sell
something up against someone with an incredible rebate,'' said
Chevrolet spokeswoman Mary McElyea.
   Ford Motor Co. is offering a $500 rebate on its Aerostar
minivan. That offer expires April 2.

   The plant repairs computer boards and assembles workstations.
Its 240 workers will be offered H-P jobs elsewhere.
   Board repair operations will be moved to H-P's plant about 12
miles away in South Queensferry, which employs about 1,000 people.
The plant's workstation manufacturing operations will be merged
with similar activities in Exeter, N.H., and Boeblingen, West
Germany, Hewlett-Packard said.
   The computer, electronics and instruments company acquired the
Livingston plant when it bought Apollo Computer Inc. in May 1989.
   Livingston employees who do not accept jobs elsewhere with H-P
will be offered a severance package that includes an amount equal
to six months of pay and half-a-month's pay for each year of
service.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended March 12, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,269.3 billion from a revised $3,269.7 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,069.4 billion from a revised $4,072.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $802.2 billion from a revised $807.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.1 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,243.5 billion, a 6.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,055.1 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1
rose 1.5 percent to an average of $798.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $292 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$74 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $304.2 billion in the two-week period ended
March 21, up from $301.3 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publisher To Buy Back $159 Million in Junk Bonds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. offered
Thursday to buy back $158.6 million of high-yield junk bonds at
prices sharply discounted from face value as the publishing company
struggles to meet debt interest payments.
   Ingersoll Newspapers is a holding company controlled by
publisher Ralph Ingersoll. Its properties include the weekly St.
Louis Suburban Journals, the Try (N.Y.) Record and several other
medium-sized papers.
   The offer is for as much as 80 percent of $125 million in 13
percent reset notes issued by Community Newspapers Inc., also a
unit of Ingersoll Publications Inc. The buyback would account for
55 percent of the principal amount.
   Ingersoll Newspapers also is offering to buy as much as 51
percent of its $114.9 million of 14.75 percent discount debentures
for 25 percent of the principal amount.
   The 13 percent notes have been trading around $390 to $420 for
$1,000 notes and the 14.75 percent debentures for about $200 for
$1,000 notes.
   The company is under the pressure of a June 30 deadline to reset
its interest rate to restore the value of the notes to face amount,
said junk bond analyst Ned Zachar of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Reset notes must be adjusted periodically to keep their trading
value in line with face value.
   Zachar said Ingersoll, like other newspaper companies in the
northeastern United States, is facing financial problems from the
overall economic slowdown. Ingersoll spokesman Mark Harnett said
earnings have fallen off.
   Zachar said he believes bondholders should accept some kind of
offer to avoid pushing the company into bankruptcy, but he expected
a higher purchase price to result from negotiations.
   ``I think there's a pretty good chance Ingersoll will suceed
with a tender offer,'' he said. ``But whether it will be at this
price or another remains to be seen. The bondholders will likely
push for a little more.''
   Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co., owns 50
percent of Community Newspapers and Ingersoll Newspapers. The other
half of both companies is owned by Warburg, Pincus Capital Partners.
   Community Newspapers operates newspapers mostly in monopoly,
medium-sized markets, including the Lorain (Ohio) Journal outside
Cleveland.
   The debt to be repurchased originally was issued by
now-collapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1987.Ingersoll is
close friends with Drexel's indicted former junk-bond chief Michael
Milken.
   Linda Hesse, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll Publications, referred
all calls on the buyback to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which is acting
as dealer managers for the offer. Goldman officials declined to
comment.

   Oil futures sagged in moderate trading Thursday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pressured by new government
statistics that showed energy supplies are bigger than expected.
   The report by the Department of Energy contrasted with industry
statistics released Tuesday that showed oil products in the
nation's storage tanks fell sharply last week. Tuesday's figures by
the American Petroleum Institute helped boost oil prices Wednesday.
   The DOE report showed that inventories fell but by much smaller
amounts.
   In trading Thursday on the New York Merc, contracts for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude, for delivery after
May fell between 1 cent and 40 cents. The May contract edged up 4
cents to finish at $20 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products, April heating oil, which surged 1.19
cents on Wednesday, fell 0.53 cent to 55.01 cents a gallon. May
heating oil rose 0.54 cents to 52.97 cents and June advanced 0.49
cent to to 52.09 cents.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in April, which gained
0.63 cent in the previous session, fell 0.56 cent to finish at
57.38 cents a gallon. The May contract dropped 0.47 cent to 61.98
cents and June lost 0.66 cent to 61.79 cents.
   Analysts said the government report on oil inventories dominated
trading.
   ``The DOE report out today showed less support for the
products,'' said Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
``The decline in prices was a reaction to the government report
after the overreaction on the API report.''
   According to the DOE, crude oil stocks declined 1.5 million
barrels in the week ended March 16 to 351 million barrels but rose
21.4 million barrels from the comparable period last year.
   Gasoline supplies fell 2.1 million barrels to 245.2 million, and
distillate fuel fell 3.7 million to 107.1 million barrels.
   Figures from API, the oil industry trade association that
represents major oil refiners, showed that total gasoline stocks
fell 2.6 million barrels in the week ended March 16 to 241 million
barrels.
   Distillate fuel supplies dropped 4.2 million barrels to 105.9
million, while crude oil inventories rose 188,000 barrels to 350.9,
API reported.

   Three former Northwest Airlines pilots were
charged by federal and state officials Thursday with operating a
Boeing 727 commercial jetliner while under the influence of alcohol.
   Charges were filed separately by the U.S. attorney's office in
Minneapolis and by North Dakota officials against Capt. Norman
Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., First Officer Robert Kirchner, 35, of
Highland Ranch, Colo., and Second Officer Joseph Balzer, 34, of
Antioch, Tenn.
   ``We consider the driving of a common carrier, whether it be an
aircraft, a train or a bus, while under the influence of alcohol to
be a very serious offense,'' U.S. Attorney Jerry Arnold told a news
conference here.
   According to an FBI agent's affidavit, Prouse purchased 14 rum
and Diet Cokes at a bar over a six-hour period the evening before
the March 8 flight left Fargo, N.D., for Minneapolis, and another
bar patron purchased five additional drinks for him. The affidavit
said the other two crew members were served seven pitchers of beer.
   Witnesses said Prouse, Balzer and Kirchner were ``visibly
intoxicated'' at the bar, the affidavit said. Between 7 to 8 hours
expired from the time the pilots left the bar and their 6:30 a.m.
flight time.
   Tests conducted at the Hennepin County Medical Center in
Minneapolis shortly after the pilots' arrest showed Prouse had a
blood-alcohol level of 0.12 percent.
   Balzer's blood-alcohol level was 0.07 percent and while
Kirchner's was 0.06 percent, according to the test results, which
were made available to The Associated Press.
   Federal regulations prohibit pilots from flying if they have
higher than a 0.04 percent level. The legal limit for driving a
vehicle is 0.10 in most states.
   Arnold said the federal felony charges were brought under a
statute passed by Congress as part of the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act
prohibiting operation of a common carrier while under the influence
of alcohol or drugs.
   The maximum penalty on the federal charges is 15 years in prison
and-or a $250,000 fine, he said.
   Arnold said arrangements were being made for the three pilots to
turn themselves in voluntarily next week in Minneapolis. They are
scheduled to be arraigned March 29, he said.
   In North Dakota, the three were charged in Cass County Court
with operating an aircraft while intoxicated and acting as an
aircraft crew member within eight hours of drinking. The charges
each are misdemeanors punishable by a $1,000 fine and one year in
prison under North Dakota law.
   ``This kind of conduct by airline pilots should not be condoned
and cannot be tolerated by today's traveling public,'' county
prosecutor Robert Hoy said. ``It's incumbent upon those individuals
with positions of responsibility over this type of conduct to make
sure it does not happen again.''
   Prouse, Balzer and Kirchner were detained in Minneapolis upon
landing Flight 650 safely, following a tip to federal authorities
that the crew had been drinking the night before.
   The airline has fired the three and the Federal Aviation
Administration has revoked their pilot licenses. The three plan to
appeal their license revocations, their attorneys have said.
   Mark McDermott, a Washington, D.C., lawyer representing
Kirchner, said the defense will ``do whatever we have to do to
defend his rights.''
   Bruce Hanley, the Minneapolis attorney who represents Balzer,
said his client will plead innocent. He said it was too early to
comment on the allegations in the government's affidavit.
   Prouse has an unlisted telephone number.
   Prosecutors from the city attorney's office in Minneapolis have
met with federal attorneys to discuss the case. Deputy City
Attorney Mitchell Rothman said Wednesday his office would wait
until federal authorities decided whether to prosecute the pilots
before deciding whether to file city charges.
   Rothman had said the city isn't likely to prosecute if federal
authorities do so.
   Bob Gibbons, Northwest Airlines' director of media relations,
declined to comment Thursday on the charges, saying, ``We won't
have any viewpoint on any of the court action involving the former
pilots.''

<HEAD>Thrift Adds Check Insurance to Customer Inducements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coast Savings, a thrift with $11.2 billion in
assets, said Thursday it would provide free insurance on many items
purchased with personal checks drawn on its accounts.
   The move is the latest by man banks and thrifts to attract
customers. Since last summer, banks have extended Monday through
Friday hours, opened on weekends, created branches in supermarkets
and even paid bonuses to customers if service lags.
   ``Everybody is after market share,'' said Dan Williams, a bank
analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. ``If (deposit insurance)
works for Coast, it may get to the point where everyone will have
to do it.''
   The plan is similar to those already provided by American
Express Co. and other credit card companies' ``gold cards,'' and a
small but growing number of banks, including California's Napa
Valley Bank and Valley National Bank of Arizona.
   Purchases included in the program and paid for in full with
Coast checks are insured for 90 days against theft, loss,
accidental breakage and fire. Manufacturers' warranties are doubled
up to a year, so a 90-day warranty is good for 180 days. Claims can
be filed through a toll-free, 24-hour number.
   Coast, with $11.2 billion in assets and 125 branches in the
state, is the first major California financial institution to
provide such insurance.
   Its president, Gerrald D. Barrone, said a quarter of Coast's
customers now have checking accounts, about 200,000 in all. The
thrift hopes to improve that figure by 50 percent this year, taking
in about $20 million a month in new checking accounts, he said.
   The program begins Monday. Some items, such as vehicles,
dwellings, coins, services, art objects, items used for business,
and consumables such as fuel and food, are excluded from coverage.
   Barrone said Coast pays an insurance company 86 cents per year
per checking account for the purchase insurance service. Coast has
a conventional range of checking accounts; one popular one provides
free checking with a minimum balance of $500.
   Financial services consultant Bert Ely said the United States is
glutted with banks and thrifts. Coast's new program ``is taking
place in the context of an extremely competitive industry,'' Ely
said.
   Big banks were watching carefully.
   ``It's definitely something we're looking at and we're aware
it's gaining in popularity, but we have no plans for a similar
program at this time,'' said Kathleen Shilkret, a spokeswoman for
San Francisco's Wells Fargo Bank.

   A House committee approved a compromise
Thursday on tougher smog controls in a clean air bill, while a
proposal for financial aid to coal miners still held up movement on
similar legislation in the Seante.
   The 38-2 vote by the House Energy and Commerce Committee created
one areas of likely conflict when the Senate and House versions of
the two bills eventually have to be reconciled. The Senate earlier
in the week rejected some of the same smog controls.
   Meanwhile, Senate leaders worked with the White House and Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., in an attempt to find a way to resolve the
dispute over the coal miner assistance.
   A vote on the amendment, brought to the floor by Byrd nearly two
weeks ago, has been postponed at least twice. Senate leaders are
fearful that Byrd has the votes to get it passed. That could
unravel the compromise legislation worked out with the White House,
they fear, because of the temptation it would pose for lawmakers to
claim similar aid for other industries.
   The coal aid amendment did not surface again Thursday or
Thursday night and aides to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said the issue would be held over to next week. Earlier in
the day Mitchell had said he expected it to ``be resolved one way
or another'' by the end of the day Thursday.
   The House committee vote came after two days of negotitions
among committee leaders, including Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
chairman. Many members voted only minutes after having first seen
the inch-thick document.
   The House provisions would continue to allow the Environmental
Protection Agency to impose an air pollution control plan if local
officials fail to act, would bring many small businesses under
smog-control regulations in cities with the dirtiest air, and would
eliminate certain waivers now possible on grounds that compliance
would cost too much. These were provisions the Senate rejected
earlier in the week.
   The Senate spent much time on marginal amendments.
   The Byrd proposal calls for a $500 million program to help
miners who lose their jobs from tougher acid rain pollution
controls. The White House calls the plan too expensive and has
lobbied hard against it.
   But Byrd, one of the Senate's most influential and most powerful
members as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, returned to
the Senate floor Thursday to plead his case.
   ``The coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price. ...
They will lose their livelihood,'' declared Byrd, calling the
assistance program essential to help 5,000 miners who are likely to
lose their jobs.
   Mitchell, eanwhile, was working with Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
minority leader, to try to get the White House to produce a
compromise aid package that might be agreeable to Byrd.
   Mitchell and Dole have said they are concerned that passage of
the assistance program would cause the White House to drop support
for the compromise clean air legislation that was agreed to in
lengthy closed-door negotiations between Senate leaders and the
Bush administration.
   If the deal falls apart there likely will be no clean air bill
from the Senate this year, Mitchell maintained earlier in the week.
   On Wednesday night, Byrd offered to lower the package's expected
cost from $700 million over four years to $500 million over three
years. Now, he said, he would retreat no further.
   ``I'm not going to stand here and say I've got 51 votes (needed
for passage), but I can tell you, `You don't have 51 votes either.'
And I can tell you I'm very close,'' Byrd told Mitchell as debate
on the issue continued late into the night Wednesday.
   Byrd complained that the White House had been unwilling to
negotiate with him, so ``I've negotiated with myself.'' Originally
