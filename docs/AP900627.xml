   Transplant recipient Stormie Jones developed
hepatitis in her second transplanted liver and was in serious
condition Tuesday, doctors at Children's Hospital said.
   The 13-year-old girl flew here from her home in White
Settlement, Texas, on Saturday to be tested after experiencing
fatigue and a change in her liver enyzyme levels.
   Hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon said Stormie's condition was
downgraded from fair to serious Tuesday after tests confirmed she
had hepatitis, an infectious inflammation of the liver.
   Stormie made medical history in 1984 when she became the world's
first heart-liver transplant recipient. The operation took place on
Valentine's Day at Children's Hospital.
   Hepatitis damaged Stormie's first transplanted liver, which was
removed in February.
   The girl received a second liver in February of this year, also
at the Pittsburgh hospital. Last month she suffered a mild episode
of liver rejection and returned to Children's for tests. Doctors
adjusted the dosage of her anti-rejection medication.

   Apparent hired assassins killed another
seven policemen Wednesday in Colombia, and a judge handling drug
trafficking cases was shot to death, authorities said.
   Three of the policemen were shot to death on the streets of the
northwestern city of Medellin, headquarters of the world's largest
cocaine gang, a spokesman with the police department said in a
telephone interview.
   The Medellin cartel has unleashed a bloodbath against Colombian
policemen, especially in that city. The three deaths Wednesday in
Medellin brought to 132 the number of policemen killed in that city
in 1990.
   The cartel has said it will pay about $4,300 to gunmen for each
policeman killed in Colombia. Drug traffickers and government
security forces have been locked in a deadly war since last
August's slaying of a presidential candidate who advocated
extradition of drug suspects to the United States.
   The police in Medellin meanwhile deactivated a car bomb
Wednesday carrying 1,000 pounds of dynamite, the police spokesman
said.
   The dynamite was in a taxi and was armed with a fuse and
detonators, the policeman said. The taxi was in a parking lot only
about a half-block from the city government's administrative office
building.
   It was the second car bomb deactivated in Medellin in a week.
   In the last 10 months, the traffickers have responded with 283
terrorist acts, including one on a domestic airliner, that have
killed 274 people.

<HEAD>House Rejects Homosexual Protection Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday rejected legislation
to protect homosexuals from harassment after an ugly debate in
which one lawmaker labeled colleagues bigots and others called gay
men and lesbians perverts.
   The House defeated the measure 118-80. Its sponsor, Rep. Babette
Josephs, a Democrat, said after the vote she was unsure what move
to take next, but vowed not to let the issue die.
   Under the measure, the same state law that gives special
protection to religious, racial and ethnic groups would have been
extended to include homosexuals.
   The bill would have extended the tougher penalties for bias
crimes to protect people who are thought to be homosexual.
   ``We have a growing and serious problem of violence against
people perceived to be gay or lesbian,'' Ms. Josephs said. ``The
problem is real, pervasive and growing.''
   In one of the most impassioned speeches of the debate, Rep.
Thomas Murphy Jr., said he was disturbed by discussion and jokes
around him on the House floor slamming homosexuals.
   ``This is bigotry in action. You don't have to go a local bar or
sports stadium to hear bigotry, you can sit on the House floor and
listen to it,'' Murphy said.
   ``Your snickers say you're bigoted. You don't condone a
different lifestyle.''
   Opponents of the bill criticized not only the measure, but also
homosexuality.
   ``I feel in my heart and in my gut that to pass this bill is
wrong,'' said Rep. Howard Fargo, a Republican. ``It's wrong to do
anything legislatively to promote sexual perversion. It's wrong to
do anything legislatively that would lead to the further
deterioration of the traditional family and its values.''
   Supporters said the issue was not one of morality, but of law
and order. One group lobbying in favor of its passage, the Pride of
Philadelphia Election Committee, which supports gay rights
candidates, had distributed a pack of letters from supporters
including Gov. Robert Casey's administration.
   Rep. Karen Ritter, a Democrat, said Pennsylvania had the most
homosexual-related murders in the nation last year.
   ``We are not providing special treatment to perversion as has
been suggested. Bigots who are unsure of their own sexuality have
already singled out homosexuals for special treatment through
violence,'' Ms. Ritter said.

   Police have recovered a painting by
18th-century master Giambattista Tiepolo that was stolen from a
Venice church last week.
   Police were investigating another theft Tuesday when they found
Tiepolo's ``The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew'' in a house near
the Church of San Stae.
   A search of the home of Stefano Frizzon, 30, turned up items
linked with the robbery of the painting, the Italian news agency
ANSA said.
   Under questioning, Frizzon said he stole the masterpiece to sell
it to support his family, the agency said.
   Frizzon led police to the painting, tightly rolled in a plastic
bag and hidden in the home of an unsuspecting neighbor, the report
said.
   The picture had been cut from its frame Thursday night. Police
said the burglar climbed through a window in the church, which did
not have an alarm system.
   The painting suffered minor damage, but can be restored,
authorities said.

<TEXT>
   In a major effort to crack down on art thefts,
France has published the first catalog of art works stolen from its
national collections.
   The authors of the catalog found that most recent thefts were
from museum storage rooms, not exhibit halls, and were probably
inside jobs. It lists 200 works stolen between 1979 and 1989 from
museums throughout the country.
   Five hundred copies of the catalog are being distributed to
police, museum and customs officials, art dealers, auctioneers and
experts in a new effort to track down stolen art and crack down on
resale on the international market, according to Andre Treps of the
Interior Ministry.
   Written by museum curators Jacqueline Munck and Vincent Pomarede
and published Tuesday, the catalog urges art professionals to take
a more forthright approach to the problem.
   ``Too often, people in charge of the art collections after a
theft feel guilty and have an understandable desire to cover it
up,'' the curators wrote.
   Many French museums do not like to discuss art thefts and blame
the media for ``falsely drawing attention to security problems,''
they wrote.
   The report, however, said that despite increased media coverage
in recent months, there has been no upsurge in thefts.
   Many museum officials may be uncomfortable with other findings
published in the catalog _ such as the fact that 57.5 percent of
the art works stolen from museums were taken out of storage rooms,
and the thefts were probably inside jobs. Only 40 percent of the
works were actually removed from exhibition walls, the report said.
   ``Stealing works from storage is a very peculiar crime, usually
committed by a guard or office worker, not for financial gain, but
usually out of spite or the desire to have a souvenir to keep,''
the report said.
   The catalog lists the stolen works in alphabetical order,
provides photographs of each work, says when and from where it was
stolen, and gives pertinent information on the artist.
   The catalog, published by the Department of National Museums and
the Interior Ministry, is to be updated on a regular basis.

<HEAD>APPLE CRUNCH: Hudson Valley Growers Face Their Troubles</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIDDLE HOPE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine generations of Cosmans, six
generations of Clarkes and four generations of Crists have worked
the land of the Hudson River Valley. Sometimes, their apple
orchards have been bountiful; sometimes, they have not.
   But generally, they have kept their problems to themselves. It
is a measure of their fears for the future that they sought out
reporters from the city to tour their farms and hear about their
troubles.
   ``The last two or three years, apples have not made money,''
said Steve Clarke from Prospect Hills Orchard Inc. in Milton.
   Consumers, and farmers, worry about chemicals. Farmers can get
more money selling their land to developers than farming it.
Competition from the Northwest and abroad is squeezing their apples
off store shelves. And bad weather and pests, of course, never go
away.
   How do growers survive?
   ``We go from year to year and look at the future and hope we're
going to be here,'' Larry Cosman said at his Mount Airy Farm in the
hamlet of Middle Hope, where he grows 250 acres of apple trees.
   ``I think the odds are kind of against us in the sense that
progress will prevail sooner or later and push out some of the
farms,'' he added later.
   Not that the farmers are railing against progress. ``We brought
you up here to show we don't have our heads in the sand,'' said
grower Jeff Crist.
   Farmers are adapting by getting closer to consumers, like the
pick-your-own orchards at Clarke's farm, and with dwarf trees,
which can be planted more densely and pruned and picked more
easily. They also are starting sales organizations that market
fruit from a group of farms, and are selling directly to
restaurants, at farm markets and stands, and abroad.
   ``Ten years ago, it was enough to know what was going on in the
confines of your orchard. It's not enough anymore,'' said Mike
Moriello of New Paltz, trying to be heard over Joe Porpiglia's
water dump, which washes apples and sends them down to the waxer.
   Not all have adapted. Some have sold their land, lot by lot.
   ``It's like they're treading water,'' said Elizabeth Ryan, who
owns a 35-acre farm with her husband and is compiling oral
histories of valley farmers.
   ``In the '60s and '70s, farmers sold their land, but they sold
it to farmers. Now they sell it to big real estate,'' said
Porpiglia, 60, as he looked out at farms that have been redeveloped
for houses. ``For sale'' signs are interspersed among the apple
blossoms.
   Farmland preservation is fashionable, but Crist's wife, Joy,
said that just saving land is not the point. ``The emphasis needs
to be on supporting and strengthening the farm business,'' she said.
   That means more research and development, a good, steady labor
force, and enough farmers so there's competition among businesses
that support farms. ``I don't see a lot of good, active farms going
out of business,'' she said.
   From the early 1800s, growers in the Hudson Valley shipped many
fruits by sloop south to New York City and points beyond, including
to South American countries now sending apples to the United States.
   When Larry Cosman was a child, wholesale buyers from New York
City would travel the valley, haggling with each farmer on his
route.
   In a 1938 booklet prepared for an apple blossom festival,
growers noted they had ``the best market in the world close at
hand,'' partly because city consumers cherished the fruits of
upstate farms.
   Cosman's father sold Happy Bee Apples, with cheery,
old-fashioned stickers plastered on wooden boxes. Most went no
farther than metropolitan New York.
   In the 1930s, Ryan said, there were 500 farms in Ulster County,
on the Hudson's western bank. In 1990, there are fewer than 200
family farms all along the valley, from New York City to Albany, a
140-mile stretch.
   In 1986, Cosman, 43, abandoned Happy Bee, because he didn't have
the volume to market his own label. Now his apples, a dozen
varieties from 40,000 trees, are Hudson Valley apples, like his
neighbors'.
   ``Sometimes you talk about it and get a little choked up,'' he
said. ``It's a family name. ... It's part of you. Farming is not
really a job, it's a lifestyle. And most farmers live, eat and
breathe what they're doing.''
   But the bottom line must prevail over sentiment. ``It's an
international business,'' Cosman said, and the Hudson Valley
growers had to market their fruit together to compete with similar
labels for Michigan and Washington state apples.
   Though exports remain a small slice of the U.S. apple business _
13 million 42-pound bushels in 1988 _ the Cosmans sometimes export
75 percent of a crop.
   Foreign climes seem very far away during a walk along Latintown
Road in Ulster County. McIntosh and lesser-known types of apple
trees spread out on all sides, looking as if nothing could touch
the serenity.
   But Alar did.
   ``If you grow apples, that changed your life forever,'' Ryan
said.
   ``On an emotional level, it was a terrible upset. ... All those
guys in Washington told us it was safe, and we believed them. We
wanted to believe them,'' said the Cornell-trained pomologist, or
fruit specialist, who did not use Alar on her farm.
   Alar, also known as daminozide, is a growth regulator that
slowed maturation and improved color and storage, making it easier
to manage harvests. But even in February 1989, when the Natural
Resources Defense Council issued its report linking Alar and
cancer, few growers were using it, said Ulster County extension
fruit expert Warren Smith.
   Nevertheless, apple prices and sales fell. Growers still are
trying to recover from losses estimated at $100 million.
   Like consumers, Cosman said, farmers have a hard time figuring
out which experts to believe. But they respond to consumers and to
costs, Moriello said, and for chemicals, the cost has gone up 30
percent to 50 percent in recent years, even though he's using less.
   Smith said all the valley's apple growers use integrated pest
management, a system that combines ecological, non-chemical methods
and natural predators with chemicals, ideally fewer and fewer of
them.
   ``We have never recommended calendar spraying when other options
are available,'' he said. ``Would you take an aspirin if you didn't
have a headache?''
   For these growers, migranes are reserved for coping with apple
prices. Though supermarkets were selling apples for up to 99 cents
a pound, Mike Moriello said he was paid 19 cents a pound wholesale.
   Preliminary figures for 1989 show Washington state alone growing
119 million bushels for eating and processing, a glut that many
growers say combined with the Alar scare for a disastrous year.
Michigan was second with 23.8 million bushels, and New York third
with 22.9 million.
   Farmers who made it this far intend to survive.
   ``We have whittled away our farm population to 2 percent,'' Ryan
said. ``The people who are in agriculture now are the people who
really want to do it. They're very insightful. They balance an
extreme number of risk factors that they don't control, unlike a
lot of other businesses.
   ``There is one saying in the farm community: `These are the
greatest gamblers in the world.' ''

<TEXT>
   The Toyotas on American roads and the Sonys
in American rec rooms may soon be joined by Fujis in American
lunchboxes _ a Japanese-bred apple that seems to be the fruit of
the future.
   Growers say Japanese bud wood grafted onto trees in the central
Washington apple belt produces an apple that is crisper, tastier
and more durable than Red Delicious, the industry standard since
the 1920s.
   The Fujis also are bringing much higher wholesale prices _ not a
minor consideration after three consecutive years of poor prices
that have caused many growers to reassess the heart-shaped Red
Delicious.
   ``There will be more change in the apple industry in the state
of Washington in the next 10 years than in the last 30,'' said
Brooke Peterson, a Washington State University tree fruit extension
agent in Yakima County.
   He likened Washington apple growers, who produce 60 percent of
the nation's crop, to U.S. automakers who were ``so big and so
successful for so long'' that they failed to respond to the
Japanese challenge.
   ``All of a sudden they are nipping us in the heels,'' he said.
   As a result, growers must produce a better and more diversified
product, he said. Currently, 70 percent of Washington's apple crop
is Red Delicious.
   ``We're in a revolution in supplying the public with an apple
more satisfactory to their needs,'' said Grady Auvil, a legendary
grower from Orondo who pioneered Washington production of the tangy
Granny Smith a decade ago.
   Auvil, 84 and still out in his Columbia River orchard every day,
is planting only Fujis on his 500 acres now.
   ``Twenty to 30 percent of the time the Red Delicious arrives to
consumers in poor condition,'' Auvil said.
   The Fuji, first bred in Japan 35 years ago, has a longer shelf
life, and shrivels on the outside before it softens inside, Auvil
said. Too often, consumers complain of biting into a good-looking
Red Delicious that is mealy.
   Tastes in apples change just as tastes in clothing, music or
other products change, some growers say. Where consumers once
clamored for bright red colors and the heart shape, now they are
demanding better taste.
   The oblong-shaped Fuji has dull red stripes over a
greenish-yellow base.
   Red Delicious apples cover more than 120,000 of the state's
160,000 acres of apple orchards. Trees take several years to bear
fruit, so it will be some time before a flood of Fujis hits
supermarkets, said Chuck St. John, a spokesman for the Washington
Apple Commission.
   He also said it is much too early to write off the Red
Delicious. ``It is not an inherently bad apple. Otherwise consumers
wouldn't buy it,'' he said. ``We can grow Red Delicious and Golden
Delicious better than they can be grown almost anyplace else in the
world.''
   The Red Delicious first was produced in a Midwest orchard in
1870 and was transported to Washington soon after. By 1915, the
state was the nation's leading apple producer.
   But growers are struggling. Two seasons ago, the crop was
severely damaged by excessive heat, and last year's sales and
prices were hurt by the Alar scare. This year, the record crop of
78 million 42-pound boxes of eating apples has been bringing prices
beneath the cost of production.
   Where boxes of Red Delicious sell for about $10 per box
wholesale, Fujis sell for up to $40, said Jeff Main of the Market
News Service in Yakima.
   Market News Service does not officially record Fuji prices,
because there are so few available, he said. But it is likely that
will change in the next three or four years, he said.
   The Fuji craze is reminiscent of the rush to plant Granny Smiths
a decade ago. That tart apple now accounts for 5.5 percent of the
state's crop.
   When Granny Smiths debuted, they, too, brought much higher
prices. Now they are bringing about $15 per box, still better than
Red Delicious.
   Auvil predicts Red Delicious will go the way of the Winesap in
the next 30 years, and will be replaced by the Fuji.
   ``It is the one sweet apple you can always deliver with good
quality if it starts the trip in good quality,'' he said.

   Worry about domestic economic
turmoil and the global crisis of communism is causing authorities
to get even tougher with dissidents and people they don't trust,
Vietnamese and Western sources report.
   The crackdown has included arrests, tightened surveillance and
suppression of the only legal dissident group, the Club of Former
Resistance Fighters. At least half a dozen foreigners have been
detained since April and two Americans accused of anti-government
activity were deported.
   Sources said conservatives appeared to have gained the upper
hand over those in the Communist Party leadership who favor
economic and other reforms.
   ``There is a tremendous sense of insecurity'' in top party
ranks, said a source with access to many officials. ``There is a
tightening up, and everybody is more cautious and afraid to say
anything. They don't acknowledge it, but you can see it in their
faces.''
   On June 16, Hanoi radio said the Interior Ministry
counterintelligence force and police, in coordination with the
armed forces, had ``promptly cracked down on many troublemaking and
sabotage activities.''
   Security forces ``caught 30 persons violating Vietnamese law and
discovered over 200 foreigners entering the country illegally,''
the radio reported.
   It said they ``destroyed five underground reactionary
organizations and captured tens of their members,'' and seized
publications ``with reactionary contents.''
   Many people ``have taken advantage'' of international
organizations investing in Vietnam to infiltrate and spy, according
to the broadcast. Thirty of more than 100 enterprises involved in
joint ventures with foreign companies were found to be operating
illegally, it said.
   Hanoi radio said the crackdown was connected with major
anniversaries, an apparent reference to the 15th anniversary April
30 of victory in the Vietnam war and the centenary May 19 of the
birth of independence leader Ho Chi Minh. Authorities feared
protests on both days, but none materialized.
   Sources say dissident activity in Vietnam is minimal and the
actions reflect ``paranoia'' over the possible loss of political
and economic support from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Another factor, they said, was the bold challenge by pro-democracy
demonstrators last year in China.
   A Hanoi radio report May 23 claimed the CIA had subverted
Eastern Europe and was trying to do the same in Vietnam by
circulating leaflets and employing tourists, overseas Vietnamese,
minority ethnic groups and Catholics.
   Many non-Communist nations halted aid to Vietnam after its
invasion of Cambodia in December 1978.
   Washington also forbids commercial dealings, but businessmen
from other Western countries have flocked to Vietnam in the
increasingly open climate of the past two years.
   The crackdown appears focused on Ho Chi Minh City, a southern
commercial center that formerly was Saigon, capital of South
Vietnam.
   For the first time in numerous visits to Vietnam in recent
years, a reporter's papers were searched before his flight left, by
a uniformed man introduced as ``a cultural officer.''
   When asked the reason for the search, the man merely chuckled. A
government employee who was to help the journalist through customs
appeared nervous and left early.
   Two well-connected sources, who demanded anonymity, said they
believed the tightening was temporary and did not mean an end to
``doi moi,'' the Communist Party's 3{-year-old economic
``renovation'' program. They added, however, that it might last
until a national party congress expected in mid-1991.
   Most of those detained were either close to the party or members
of it, the sources said. The Hanoi radio report said some
``confused and utopian'' party members had aided the alleged CIA
sabotage campaign.
   An early sign of trouble in the party was Tran Xuan Bach's
expulsion in March from the ruling Politburo after he supported
greater democracy.
   Security forces also feared the decentralization of the economy
and some political affairs had increased public discontent, the
sources reported.
   Farmers demanding land reform marched in Ho Chi Minh City last
year. It was the first known street demonstrations under Communist
rule.
   Students have held campus protests of poor conditions at the
universities.
   Hundreds of people protested at the city hall, demanding
repayment of money they invested in a perfume company that used
liberalized rules to create a pyramid scheme.
   Smuggling, corruption and crime have become major issues.
   Authorities decided the presence of foreigners would complicate
matters and tightened visa rules in late April, a Vietnamese
official said privately.
   Western businessmen said officials who once pleaded for
investment had slowed things down and were preoccupied with
ideological matters.
   In interviews with The Associated Press, authorities said there
were no mass arrests.
   No more than 10 Vietnamese were arrested with businessman Mike
Morrow, one of the Americans deported, said Nguyen Son, vice
chairman of the information and ideological department in Ho Chi
Minh City.
   Gen. Tran Cong Man, vice president of the Vietnamese Journalists
Association, said there have been no mass arrests, ``but many
people were warned.''
   Morrow said his interrogators were convinced he was a spy and
that the United States was trying to ``create a Tiananmen in
Vietnam,'' a reference to the Beijing pro-democracy demonstrations
crushed a year ago.
   The American, who was held for three weeks before deportation,
said those arrested with him included Do Trung Hieu, a respected
intellectual who belongs to the Communist Party.
   Miriam Hershberger, an American teacher in the capital, Hanoi,
was deported June 5 for allegedly trying to incite student unrest.
   Both Americans were considered sympathetic to the government, as
was Chan Tin, one of two Catholic priests detained in May and
accused of preaching anti-communism. Like Hieu, he was a leader of
wartime opposition to the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam.
   The Club of Former Resistance Fighters is made up of southern
war heroes and revolutionaries who criticize the party's postwar
performance but have not questioned its leading role.
   In March, the club's two leaders were expelled, apparently on
orders from the authorities, a source reported. He said the club
approved a resolution in January criticizing the government and
demanding more political reform.
   Nguyen Son, the Ho Chi Minh City party official, denied the
report. He said the club's executive board expelled the leaders
after they ``wrote and distributed documents calling for protests
against the government.''
   Son said one of the men, Ta Ba Tang, was under ``temporary
detention'' and the other, Nguyen Ho, was at home. He did not make
clear whether Ho was under restrictions.
   A British journalist who reported the club's actions after
interviewing Tang and other members was detained briefly and
several of his Vietnamese contacts were reported arrested.

   Kiko Kawashima is a college student living in a
small apartment with her parents, but come Friday, Japan's
modern-day Cinderella will call a palace her home.
   In Japan's first royal wedding in six years, the 23-year-old
Miss Kawashima is to wed Emperor Akihito's youngest son, Prince
Aya, who is 24 and second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   The wedding will be lavish _ the government has allotted nearly
$1 million _ and filled with traditions dating back more than 1,000
years.
   But to a nation that only last year buried Emperor Hirohito,
whose 62-year reign spanned a turbulent period of militarist
expansionism and economic reconstruction, the wedding also is being
hailed as the first taste of a new era.
   As far as the clearly smitten Japanese media are concerned,
Prince Aya could not have chosen a better mate than ``Kiko-san,''
who is only the second commoner to marry into the imperial family.
   Aya's mother, Empress Michiko, became the first in 1959 when she
married Emperor Akihito, who was then crown prince. Akihito
ascended the throne immediately after Hirohito's death on Jan. 7,
1989.
   Most of Japan's major television networks will broadcast live
coverage of the ceremony and related events. The wedding is
scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and will be followed by several other
ceremonies, so television coverage will likely last well into the
night.
   Along with the countless comparisons to Cinderella, Miss
Kawashima has been dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because of her
relatively humble abode _ faculty housing on the campus of Tokyo's
Gakushuin University.
   At Gakushuin, Miss Kawashima is working on her master's degree
in psychology. Her father, Tatsuhiko, teaches economics there.
   The former peer's school boasts much of the imperial family and
former nobility among its alumni. It is where Miss Kawashima and
her prince met in 1985, when he too was a Gakushuin student.
   Since the engagement of Aya and Miss Kawashima was formally
announced in September, flocks of reporters often have staked out
the Kawashimas' three-bedroom apartment.
   They have tagged along as Miss Kawashima did her final
pre-wedding shopping, and even as she made a rare appearance at a
bowling alley. Her score was reportedly about 100.
   Though the Japanese and their media generally treat the monarchy
with great deference, photographing Miss Kawashima's mother hanging
the family laundry out to dry is apparently acceptable, as is
broadcasting it to millions of television viewers.
   Aya, who returned Thursday from two years of zoology studies at
England's Oxford University, has managed to avoid most of the media
blitz.
   Palace officials say the somber, 15-minute wedding will begin
with the sound of shrill classical Japanese music. The young
couple, attended by several chamberlains, will slowly walk down a
corridor to a wooden shrine at the Imperial Palace.
   After Aya makes his vows to the sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom
legend says the imperial family descended, the couple will sip rice
wine to seal their marital bond.
   Later in the day, they are to visit Akihito and Michiko to
announce their marriage. In keeping with tradition, the emperor and
empress will not be among the guests invited to the ceremony itself.
   The guest list, however, does include such dignitaries as Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and the heads of the judicial and
legislative branches of government.
   The emperor is to bestow upon Aya a new title to mark his
marriage and creation of an independent household. Aya's given name
is Fumihito, but Japanese only rarely refer to him by that.
   Following three days of receptions, and three more days to rest,
Aya and Miss Kawashima will travel to the Grand Shrines of Ise, the
central place of worship for believers of Shinto, Japan's
indigenous religion.
   Before returning to Tokyo, where they will pay their respects at
Hirohito's mausoleum, they also will visit the tomb dedicated to
Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who according to legend began his
reign in 660 B.C.
   Police plan to mobilize 9,000 officers to guard against leftist
attacks, and the public will have little chance to see the royal
couple in person.
   But a short ``parade,'' from the Imperial Palace to the Akasaka
Palace where the emperor and empress reside, is planned.

   Senators who defeated a constitutional
amendment against burning the American flag say the uproar may have
eased slightly in recent weeks but the issue remains a sore point
with many voters.
   ``It's still a tough issue,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said
Tuesday after the Senate's 58-42 vote for the measure fell nine
votes short of the two-thirds margin required.
   He said the dispute has ``opened a wound in this nation,'' but
voters are seeing ``that the fabric of American society has not
been threatened by flag burners ... and in the end I think that's
what turned this debate.''
   On the roll call, 38 Republicans voted for the amendment and
seven opposed it. Among Democrats, 20 were for it and 35 against.
   The vote was largely symbolic because the amendment, which had
President Bush's backing, also fell short of the necessary
two-thirds vote in the House last week. Democratic leaders attacked
it as an infringement on freedom of speech.
   The Senate pushed ahead with a vote on the amendment even though
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., had said he would not schedule
a new vote in his chamber regardless of how the Senate acted.
   Sponsors said they would keep campaigning for the amendment
nevertheless.
   ``We'll see what happens in the days and weeks and months
ahead,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   He said Americans were pained to see protesters show disrespect
for the nation by burning the flag and had been counting on
Congress to settle the issue once and for all with a constitutional
amendment.
   ``In the heartland of America, some folks just can't understand
what Congress is up to,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the issue was ``so important
that it should be sent to the states where the American people can
decide whether they want to protect the flag.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., another amendment supporter, said,
``Americanism cannot survive unless it has nationalism ...
Americanism must have sacred symbols.''
   Critics of the proposed amendment said the Senate vote was
designed primarily to put them on record on an emotionally charged
issue in a way that could be used by conservative challengers in
fall election campaigns.
   ``Stirred by fears of sound bites and 30-second spots, members
of Congress who should know better are expressing a willingness to
sacrifice the Bill of Rights for what they hope will be a benefit
in the polls,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said his mail had turned against the
amendment. And Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said heavy debate over the
issue in recent weeks may have changed some minds. ``The more
people learn about this, the more they hear discussion and hear all
of the ramifications, the less likely they are to go for the
amendment,'' he said.
   Kerrey said after the vote that it ``doesn't feel like a
victory, it doesn't feel as good as it ought to'' because ``a wound
has been opened in America, a real wound.''
   The highly decorated Vietnam veteran said many veterans feel
strongly about the measure and as a result of his opposition ``they
are disappointed, they are disillusioned.''
   In the debate leading to the vote, the Senate rejected three
rival plans.
   It killed, 93-7, a plan offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., that would have allowed Congress to
ban desecrating the flag in various prescribed ways, such as
trampling or mutilating.
   The Senate rejected, 90-10, a plan by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
to strip the Supreme Court of its power to decide flag desecration
cases. Helms said it was needed to combat ``these kooks ... these
loonies who burn the American flag.''
   And it rejected, 51-48, a proposal by Bumpers that would have
outlawed by statute any flag burning that could lead to a breach of
the peace. Bumpers said the amendment, as it came to the floor, was
too broad and would cover too many harmless uses of the flag.

   No more $1,500 ringside seats, or $200 dinners
at Le Cirque. Forget the stretch limo; hail a cab. Helicopter? Take
the bus, babe. Hard times are here for Donald Trump, a man on a
bank-enforced allowance.
   Granted, this is no ordinary budget _ reportedly $450,000 per
month, $5.4 million a year, or $14,794.52 a day, enough to make the
average guy drool. The allowance is part of a deal with Trump's
bankers to keep his financial empire afloat.
   But this will mean some sacrifices by a man not used to making
them. The millionaire developer reportedly spent $583,000 on his
extravagant lifestyle in May, money above and beyond the $841,000
maintenance on his yacht and the $246,000 upkeep on his private
plane.
   There are those who believe Trump can make the necessary
sacrifices to scrape by on his stipend.
   ``Donald Trump has always lived and worked the lifestyle of the
rich and famous, and it will continue under the new
circumstances,'' predicted Robin Leach, host of that syndicated TV
show about the lifestyles of the you-know-who.
   There's also good news from the authors of ``New York on $1,000
A Day'' (which would leave Donald $13,794.52 a day to work with):
``New York ... the possibilities are endless. The solutions are
only as limited as your own imagination.''
   Now imagine these money-saving tips, Donald, provided free of
charge:
   _No more chopper service to Atlantic City. A Domenico Tours bus
can pick you up at Broadway and 69th Street (just a 15-block walk
from Trump Tower). Bonus: $10 in change and a $2.50 lunch coupon
upon arrival at the Trump Plaza. Plus a $5 voucher good in
September in case things get worse.
   _Forget dinner at Le Cirque ($150 and up for two) or 21 ($70 for
two, entrees only). They were once among Ivana's favorites, but
they're a little too pricey now. Two hot dogs and a soda from a
pushcart go for $2.75.
   _Cut back on your phone bill. In ``Trump: The Art of the Deal,''
you detail making more than 100 calls per day. How many calls do
you really WANT to return these days?
   _Pack up the $1,800 Brioni suits and start buying off the rack.
Stop seeing Broadway shows at $55 a ticket and head to the Bronx,
where Yankee Stadium bleacher seats are a mere $4.50.
   _Get out of the boxing business before you end up like
bare-chested promoter Butch Lewis _ losing your shirt.
   Trump, writing in his book, demonstrated there were some areas
where he's frugal. The Donald doesn't drink, which means no
unsightly bar tabs, and he rarely eats lunch _ just ``a can of
tomato juice'' most days, he said.
   But life on a budget will be bothersome. Trump acknowledged as
much in ``Art of the Deal'' when he observed, ``If there's one
thing I've learned about the rich, it's that they have a very low
threshold for even the mildest discomfort.''

   Sidney Poitier will play Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall in a $10 million ABC miniseries,
``Separate But Equal.''
   The four-hour production to be filmed in South Carolina
beginning in August will center on a landmark school desegregation
case of the 1950s, director George Stevens Jr. said Tuesday.
   Marshall, then an attorney for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, argued the case for better schools
brought by black residents of Summerton, S.C.
   The case eventually was consolidated with four others that were
decided in the 1954 Supreme Court decision Brown vs. Board of
Education. In that decision, the high court found school
segregation unconstitutional.
   The movie will air in April.

   The rap group 2 Live Crew, whose ``As Nasty

will parody the Bruce Springsteen hit ``Born in the U.S.A.'' as
``Banned in the U.S.A.''
   Springsteen was comfortable with the lyrics and agreed to use of
the parody, spokeswoman Marilyn Laverty said Tuesday.
   Jack Thompson, the lawyer who led the campaign that got the 2
Live Crew album declared obscene, objected to the parody. ``Mr.
Springsteen, you're now harmful to the women and children who have
bought your albums,'' he said in a letter.
   2 Live Crew's attorney, Alan Jacobi, said the parody is due out
next month. It has no sexually explicit lyrics, he said.
   Three weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. ruled
``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' obscene in South Florida.

   Screaming fans gave singer Donnie
Wahlberg of the New Kids on the Block a tumultous sendoff from the
hospital where he recuperated from injuries suffered in a fall on
stage.
   About 200 fans, mostly teen-age girls, greeted the 20-year-old
Wahlberg as his bodyguard escorted him out of Saratoga Hospital on
Tuesday after a two-day stay. Wahlberg signed autographs and hugged
and kissed fans.
   ``Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! He kissed me!''
said Loren Ferrara, 13. She said she had waited 11 hours to see the
singer.
   Wahlberg gashed his chin and suffered cuts on his chest, arm and
mouth when he fell through a trap door during a concert Sunday at
Saratoga Raceway.
   He is expected to return to the stage Thursday in Hoffman
Estates, Ill.
   The New Kids have recently topped the pop charts with the songs
``Step by Step'' and ``Hang Tough.''

   Track star Carl Lewis admits in his new book
that he was given money by Nike while competing for the University
of Houston _ a violation of NCAA rules.
   In ``Inside Track, My Professional Life in Amateur Track and
Field,'' the six-time Olympic gold medalist disclosed that his
orginal contract with the athletic shoe manufacturer was for $5,000
with provisions for bonuses.
   Later, it was renegotiated into a four-year deal with a base
figure of $200,000 plus bonuses for winning Olympic gold medals,
achieving top rankings in the 100-meter dash and long jump, and
setting world records.
   Lewis was not a student during the last three years of the
renegotiated deal.
   Nike spokeswoman Liz Dolan said Tuesday the company knew it was
violating National Collegiate Athletic Association rules when it
signed Lewis while he was a student.
   ``We thought Carl deserved the support at a time when athletes
didn't have the means to support themselves while training,'' she
said. ``We were happy to support one of America's most promising
athletes.''
   Dolan said Nike's relationship with Lewis began in 1981 when he
approached the company.

   The double bill of singers Mel Torme and Cleo
Laine was what a jazz festival concert should be _ both performers
on stage all evening, doing something special.
   Too often, two performers perform separately, before and after
intermission, and the audience gets the same show it would hear at
a nightclub.
   At Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night during the JVC Jazz Festival,
the two superb jazz singers performed duets and traded solos. What
made the evening even more exciting were the innovative
arrangements by John Dankworth, who also led a six-piece band and
played clarinet and saxophone.
   Songs from Broadway shows plus some other songs embodied the
concert's theme, ``Broadly Broadway.''
   The performers started with ``Lullaby of Broadway.'' Then Torme,
with vocal warmth and swinging lightly, sang ``When There's a Shine
on Your Shoes.'' Miss Laine went from low and sexy to really
wailing on ``Taking a Chance on Love.''
   Torme sang a fine medley from ``Guys and Dolls'' and
``Soliloquy'' from ``Carousel,'' the latter an interpretation which
seemed more concerned with pretty top notes than content. Torme
played piano on one number and drums on another with a show-off
attitude which seemed not to rattle Miss Laine's secure stage
presence.
   She was singing at her peak, with rare phrasing and enunciation.
She made ``With Every Breath I Take'' from ``City of Angels''
mysterious, and ended in the stratosphere, impressed with ``Fine
and Mellow.''
   Torme, who looked slim and trim, sounded fine and mellow on
``Bye, Bye, Blackbird,'' which Dankworth flavored with just enough
saxophone noodling.
   The two singers scatted together, making ``Lady Be Good''
exciting, joined for ``I Wish I Were in Love Again'' and put ``I
Loves You Porgy'' and ``Bess You Is My Woman Now'' into a smooth,
beautiful duet.
   Four hundred of the seats were priced at $250 and included a jam
session by Torme, Miss Laine, Dankworth and other performers
afterwards at Michael's Pub, as a benefit for Carnegie Hall.

   Freshman Democratic Rep. Ben Jones is treading
carefully as he explains to the folks in his generally Republican
district why he helped lead the fight against the constitutional
amendment banning flag burning.
   But so far, the flag has not become the hot campaign issue some
Republicans predicted, and even Jones' GOP challenger is being
careful in his criticism of Jones' vote.
   Georgia's 4th Congressional District includes Atlanta suburbs
and rural outlying areas. It is mostly affluent, and until last
year its congressman was Republican Pat Swindall, who had one of
the most conservative records in the House.
   But under a perjury indictment, Swindally lost a bid for a third
term in 1988 to Jones, an actor who played Cooter in television's
``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Jones has experience with touchy subjects. He was the first to
raise his alcoholic past in his two campaigns against Swindall. He
also tackled the flag vote directly, bringing it up Monday in a
talk in his hometown of Covington.
   ``Leadership means you will have tough choices and sometimes
will be very lonely,'' Jones told about 60 community, business and
government leaders at the Leadership Newton County meeting.
   Nobody likes flag burners, Jones said, but a constitutional
amendment would be an overreaction to a ``handful of malcontents.''
   Members listened attentively to Jones and gave him mixed
reviews, said Bobby Myhand, the non-partisan group's chairman.
   ``Some people agreed with him and some didn't,'' Myhand said.
   With Swindall appealing his perjury conviction, the Republican
banner is being carried by state Rep. John Linder. The national GOP
has targeted Linder for financial support.
   Linder blamed the defeat of the flag-burning amendment on
``remnants of the `Me Generation''' in the House.
   ``I think Jones has been voting like a left-winger since he's
been in there,'' Linder said.
   Lindner said the vote would be an issue, but not the only issue,
in a district with an estimated 78,000 veterans out of about
400,000 potential voters.
   Thus far, Linder has limited most of his criticism to answering
questions about the vote, rather than bringing up the subject.
``I'm not going to wrap myself in the flag,'' he said Tuesday after
a fund-raiser in suburban Atlanta with Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole.
   Jones and Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, were the only members of
Georgia's congressional delegation to oppose the amendment in last
week's vote. The proposal would have given Congress and the states
power to prohibit flag desecration.
   Atlanta-based pollster Claibourne Darden said Jones' vote won't
help him in the November election.
   ``It was a stupid mistake. We're not dealing with right and
wrong here; we're dealing with stupid and smart,'' Darden said.
   ``Ben's a gunslinger. He shoots from the hip, and consequently
he makes mistakes. But that also makes it interesting.''
   Elliott Levitas, the Democrat who in 1984 lost the 4th District
seat he held for 10 years, said he doubted the flag-protection vote
would determine the outcome of the race.
   ``A lot of people who would vote against Jones because of that
issue would vote against him for three other reasons as well,''
Levitas said.
   DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Manuel Maloof, a Jones
supporter, said his stand on the amendment may help him.
   ``Knowing the district as he did and still standing up took the
kind of courage you want to see in Congress,'' Maaoof said. ``It
takes guts.''

<HEAD>Voters Reject School Funding Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A share-the-wealth plan for Oklahoma
schools was soundly rejected in a special election Tuesday as
voters in the eastern and western sections of the state split
sharply over the issue.
   An aide to Gov. Henry Bellmon predicted a federal lawsuit would
be filed challenging the disparity in Oklahoma's school funding
system.
   ``Unfortunately we'll probably end up in federal court and the
federal courts will write our funding laws instead of the people of
Oklahoma,'' said the governor's chief of staff, Andrew Tevington.
   The proposal, listed on the ballot as State Question 634, called
for redistributing on a statewide basis oil and property tax
revenue that now goes to local schools.
   Some western counties with large oil reserves and utility
facilities were voting against the plan by margins of more than
10-1. The measure was beaten badly in Oklahoma City, the state's
largest city, and in most rural areas, but was favored by a large
margin in Tulsa, the second largest city.
   Proponents of 634 said it was needed to end a situation whereby
some school districts receive little more than $2,000 per student
in funding and others get more than $10,000 per student.
   Bellmon had said the present system was ``not defensible'' and
warned that Oklahoma could be subject to a lawsuit if it were not
revised.
   In April, the state Legislature approved a $223 million school
funding and tax measure that included pay raises for teachers,
ending a statewide strike.
   Dan Brown, a financial consultant who led a citizen group that
opposed State Question 634, said he thought the outcome showed a
basic distrust of the Legislature.
   ``I think they are dissatisfied with the overall approach of the
Legislature by trying to really force-feed Oklahomans,'' Brown
said. ``They did not trust the Legislature to write a (school
funding) formula that would be fair to all,'' Brown said.
   Voters also defeated three other state questions that would have
changed how state school land money is handled, removed antiquated
language from the state Constitution on school attendance and
changed the membership of the state school board.

   George Bush's taunting cry of ``read-my-lips,
no-new-taxes'' proved to be a dandy political slogan but a woefully
inadequate prescription for the economy. Slammed by huge budget
deficits that kept getting worse, the president finally shut his
mouth.
   To the delight of Democrats and the despair of Republicans, Bush
conceded Tuesday that higher taxes would be required _ yes,
required _ if there's to be any hope of getting the deficit under
control.
   It was a major about-face for Bush, who had steadfastly argued
during the presidential campaign and at the White House that higher
taxes would rob the country of economic growth.
   Putting the best face on developments, the White House said Bush
was doing what he could to put a spark in the sluggish budget
deficit-reduction talks with Congress. Predictably, Democrats had a
different interpretation.
   ``The charade is finally over,'' chortled Rep. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J.
   ``The other shoe raised in the 1988 presidential campaign has
just dropped,'' Torricelli said. ``George Bush has announced that
he's raising taxes.''
   Michael Dukakis, the Democrat who lost to Bush, lamented, ``I
told the truth and I paid the price. Mr. Bush did not and we're all
now going to have to pay the price for that.''
   Republicans, mindful that they will have to answer to voters in
November, staged a quick revolt against Bush's tax conversion.
   A letter circulated by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., a member of
the House GOP leadership, declared, ``Mr. President, we were
stunned by your announcement. ... A tax increase is unacceptable.''
   Ninety Republicans _ more than half of the 176 House GOP members
_ hurried to sign the letter.
   The White House quickly began to backpedal to deal with panicky
Republicans. Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, assured
Republicans that nothing had really changed, that the president's
statement ``doesn't mean anything new.''
   But Bush's own words said otherwise. He said ``tax revenue
increases'' would be necessary.
   A cautious leader, Bush changed his mind on taxes not in a
sudden swoop but slowly, step by step.
   When he first took office, it appeared the deficit problem had
peaked, stabilizing at about $150 billion before beginning to nose
down.
   Bush held the line on taxes his first year, but then submitted a
budget to Congress last January that proposed $13 billion in
increases. He called them something else _ revenue enhancers and
higher user fees.
   Instead of improving, though, the deficit crisis worsened,
largely because of sluggish economic growth and
higher-than-expected interest rates.
   The latest estimate, both from the White House and Congress, is
that unless something is done, the deficit will soar past $200
billion when the cost of the savings and loan bailout is included.
   When budget negotiations began in the spring, Bush said
everything was on the table. Did that mean he would go along with
higher taxes? Bush refused to show his hand.
   Finally, after an unannounced breakfast meeting with
congressional leaders on Tuesday, Bush released a statement
removing his once-solid prohibition on tax increases.
   Republicans cried that Bush had robbed them of their best
campaign ploy _ the same one he had used to beat Dukakis.
   Rep. Bill Schuette, R-Mich., who is using an anti-tax theme to
try to oust Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, recoiled from Bush's
statement. ``The president's recipe for deficit reduction includes
a fatal ingredient _ tax increases,'' Schuette said.
   Agreeing with Bush's old philosophy, Schuette said a tax
increase would be ``bad medicine for economic growth, stall out the
economy and put people out of work.''
   Democrats, of course, were delighted by Bush's change in course.
   ``It was a successful tactic in '88,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony,
D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee.
   ``I think the president now has had a reality check,'' Anthony
added. ``He's had advisers around him saying this country is going
down on your watch.''

   What looks sexy in the evening? What do people want
to parade in, and how rich do they want to appear?
   It has a lot to do with the tenor of the times. A stunning show
at the Musee de la Mode Galliera that opened Monday and runs until
October 28 gives an informative look at ``dream clothes'' for
evening from 1850 through today.
   From the waist-cinching hourglass-figure frippery of the Second
Empire through today's coat-of-mail armored mini by Paco Rabanne,
the show demonstrates how women have presented themselves at their
fanciest.
   The catalogue by the museum's head curator, Catherine
Join-Dieterle, and her assistant, Valerie Guillaume, explains
conventions and lifestyles behind dressing up through eight major
fashion periods.
   With outfits from the museum's archives, other museums
(including New York's Metropolitan) and major couture houses from
Chanel to Lacroix, the show furnishes a close-up retrospective of
some of the world's most opulent clothes, set dramatically in the
museum's marble halls.
   There also are ensembles from the wardrobes of famous women: a
yellow embroidered coat and gown by Dior for Princess Grace of
Monaco in 1956; a jeweled satin strapless Dior worn by the Duchess
of Windsor.
   ``Ball dresses were very important under the Second Empire of
Louis Napoleon and Eugenie,'' said Ms. Join-Dieterle, introducing
the show from its chronological start.
   ``There were also strict conventions, such as you had to wear
bosom-revealing decolletes to a ball, but to the theatre or another
function, chests and arms had to be covered, even by lace.''
   She pointed out several beautiful gowns with hooped skirts that
had practical, interchangeable jackets ``so the same outfit could
be worn from late-day into the ball by switching the top.''
   When the Empire collapsed, entertaining went back home, but
clothes were no less rich, as shown by bustled models that
Anglo-Saxons would identify as Victorian.
   From the Belle Epoque period up to World War I, young girls wore
white, pink and lace.
   ``But changes were coming in tea-gown styles and pantaloons,''
said Ms. Join-Dieterle.
   ``At-home entertaining was very much the thing in the early part
of the century, though women were beginning to go out to
restaurants _ formerly reserved for coquettes or mistresses, rather
than wives. And there were clothes for that too.''
   She pointed out a window full of extravagant hats seen around
town before 1914 _ ``usually worn to the theatre, and even
provoking lawsuits since they kept people from seeing the play.''
   Outfits for dancing the Charleston in the Roaring Twenties show
the period as stylish but unsexy with high-necked, shapeless
flappers by Patou, Chanel and Worth.
   ``But legs were being bared to the knee, and that was very
daring at first,'' Join-Dieterle observed.
   Through the 1930s, and up to the latest collections, the show
progresses with lessons in sociological-fashion trends like the
1950s return of the full-crinolined debutante gown. ``After the
War's austerity, it was important to dress up again,'' said Ms.
Join-Dieterle.
   ``It's obvious what women thought of dressing up in the late
Sixties and early Seventies,'' she remarked. ``Not much.''
   The evening wear from the early Sixties included a tiny
mini-skirted yellow Ungaro suit, Mondrian-painting style dresses by
Saint Laurent and Cardin, a micro-mini with cut-outs and feathers
by Courreges.
   ``But the couturiers saw the un-dressed trend coming back before
the student revolutions of 1968,'' Join-Dieterle said.
   Saint Laurent's black tuxedo evening suit looms in the room as a
harbinger for what a woman can still wear out to a party without
looking either over- or underdressed.
   The show also gives a nod to near-nudity with a Saint Laurent
black chiffon and feathers from the Seventies, and to younger
creators like Jean-Paul Gaultier with his brazen underwear look and
Claude Montana, whose ropy fishnet tops a mannequin's bare bosom.

   Here is a glance at West Germany's
proposed treaty for full political unification with East Germany,
which would follow the July 1 merger of the two nations' economies.
   The political treaty is conditional on the successful resolution
of talks between the two Germanys and the four World War II victors
_ the Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France _ on the
international ramifications of German unity.
   The parliaments of both German states would have to approve the
proposed treaty, which contains three articles of union.

the West German constitution that will allow it to become a part of
West Germany.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assembled schoolchildren
hailed the declaration of the ``Year of Peace'' by tossing skyward
50 doves.
   The birds, which had been too tightly clutched through hours of
delayed ceremonies and President Alfredo Cristiani's speech,
flapped and flailed and crashed to ungainly landings on the
national legislature's parking lot.
   But they eventually limbered their cramped wings. They took
flight.
   Like the schoolchildren's flock in the June 1 ceremony, the
difficult negotiating process intended to end 10 years of civil war
in El Salvador has also had a tough time getting off the ground.
   But government and guerrilla negotiators on Monday ended a week
of talks in Mexico that the U.N. mediator said produced
unprecedented movement. Both sides expressed guarded optimism that
next month's round could produce concrete accords to pave the way
for a cease-fire before the year's end.
   The obstacles to a settlement are daunting and the climb is
steeply uphill. Four efforts at negotiating peace between 1984 and
1989 broke down over mutual recriminations of intransigence.
   Yet, perhaps for the first time in the war, both sides appear
definitively convinced that military resolution of the conflict is
impossible and that there is no alternative to good-faith
negotiation.
   ``It's the old question of whether the glass is half empty or
half full,'' said guerrilla negotiator Salvador Samayoa. ``I prefer
to see it as half full. And not because of mere optimism, but
because conditions favor movement toward peace.''
   In November, the rebels launched their biggest offensive of the
war, trying to spark insurrection that would topple the government.
Failing that, the offensive was designed to leave the insurgents
entrenched in urban positions from which they could demand and
obtain an expeditious negotiated solution.
   The huge push was beaten back after three weeks. The product of
many months of preparation, the offensive failed to define the
war's outcome.
   For its part, the government is being nudged toward a negotiated
solution by a combination of factors.
   The guerrilla offensive, although ultimately unsuccessful,
showed the military the rebels remain strong and motivated.
Cristiani's Republican Nationalist Alliance wants to do well in
legislative and municipal elections scheduled for March, and
expects the mantle of peacemaker would produce significant
electoral dividends.
   Perhaps most important, the U.S. government that has funded the
nearly bankrupt government and war effort has served notice it will
not continue providing large sums merely to maintain the status quo.
   The U.N.-mediated peace process addresses a seven-point agenda,
the top item of which is the future role of the armed forces. The
talks' eventual success hinges on accord on that subject, by far
the most difficult.
   El Salvador is a small volcano-studded nation of 5 million on
the Pacific Coast of Central America notorious throughout its
history for lopsided distribution of wealth.
   The armed forces were for most of this century the key factor in
ensuring that the few rich got richer while the many poor remained
so.
   Relatively progressive younger officers staged a coup in 1979
with the stated intention of modernizing and democratizing the
country. But the reform movement, assailed on one side by old-line
rightist officers, degenerated into a bloody conflict with rebels
wanting revolutionary change.
   An estimated 72,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the war.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a leftist
insurgent army of about 7,000 full-time combatants and perhaps
twice as many part-time militia members, is battling a U.S.-funded
force of 56,000 soldiers and militarized police.
   The FMLN contends that despite periodic elections and democratic
trappings, the government is a civilian facade on military
dictatorship.
   Though government officials describe El Salvador as a fledgling
democracy, the armed forces enjoy a degree of power and privelege
uncountenanced by any modern democratic system.
   The rebels demand ``demilitarization'' of Salvadoran society.
   Shafik Handal, leader of the rebel delegation in Mexico, said
demilitarization includes disappearance of the insurgent army.
   But before the guerrillas demobilize, they demand first of all
an end to military impunity.
   Although international rights organizations blame the armed
forces for the slaying, outside of combat, of many thousands of
suspected opponents, not a single officer has been convicted, or
even tried, for a rights abuse crime.
   Handal and other guerrilla chiefs acknowledge that trial and
conviction of all or even most offenders is utopian, and have
centered demands for prosecution on four ``exemplary'' cases.
   The rebels say identification of those responsible for egregious
abuses and their administrative removal from positions of command
would suffice as punishment for those implicated in crimes other
than the four symbolic cases.
   In addition to the purge, the rebels demand abolishment of
militarized police forces they consider repressive and creation of
a new police force under civilian command and control.
   Agreements on the dismantling of paramilitary organizations,
drastic reduction in the number of military personnel and an end to
forced recruitment are also rebel conditions for giving up the
armed struggle.
   Oscar Santamaria, chief of the government delegation to the
Mexican talks, told The Associated Press that the discussions
produced advances that could pave the way for accords at the next
round.
   Among elements contributing to chances for successful
negotiations:
   The United States supports the removal of tainted and corrupt
officers. Government officials privately concur that, once the war
is over, police forces should be under a civilian portfolio rather
than the Defense Ministry.
   And Cristiani has pledged to significantly reduce military
strength once peace is achieved.
   If the military stumbling blocks are overcome, the other issues
_ human rights, judicial and electoral reform, constitutional
revision and economic accords _ could follow relatively easily.

   The last time Congress and President Bush
raised taxes for deficit reduction, they put the bite on banks,
large corporations and defense contractors.
   The whole package _ enacted last November _ cost taxpayers about
$8 billion a year. But because of its scatter-gun approach, nobody
complained too loudly.
   As a result of Bush's announcement Tuesday that tax increases
will have to be part of any significant deficit-reduction plan this
year, congressional leaders and the president's advisers will be
looking for the same kind of low-pain plan.
   But that kind of tax increase may be hard to find this year,
simply because there is a limit to the number of ``loopholes'' that
can be closed and corporate tax breaks that can be taken away.
After all, President Reagan signed similar tax increases in 1987
and 1988.
   Many Democrats in Congress argue that the first target of any
tax increase should be the rich. ``We ought to look at those groups
who have profited from the tax structure of the 1980s,'' Sen. James
Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, says.
   One proposal that has drawn wide attention would tax part of the
earnings of the richest 600,000 Americans at a maximum rate of 33
percent. All their taxable income now is taxed at 28 percent, even
though some earnings of those with less income may be taxed at 33
percent.
   Some lawmakers insist, however, that while Bush is backing away
from his 1988 campaign pledge to oppose tax increases, he is set
solidly against raising personal income taxes.
   Higher gasoline taxes? Bush specifically rejected that idea in
the 1988 campaign and there is strong opposition from rural
lawmakers. But it has considerable support in Congress because it
would not only raise $1 billion a year for each one-cent increase
but also assist in conserving energy.
   How about raising taxes on cigarettes and beverage alcohol? A
higher cigarette tax is a good bet, in part because of health costs
associated with smoking. But the tax on hard liquor already is
considerably higher than on beer and wine, and there is some
reluctance in an election year to risk offending ``Joe Sixpack''
and the wine-and-cheese crowd.
   The Congressional Budget Office annually draws up a list of tax
increase options but makes no recommendations. Here are some of
this year's candidates and what they would cost taxpayers in 1991:
   INDEXING: Delay for one year the annual mandated tax cuts
designed to keep cost-of-living pay raises from pushing workers
into higher brackets. $5.4 billion. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed it as part
of a plan to require most Americans to share the pain of deficit
reduction.
   STATE, LOCAL TAXES: Allow deduction only of property and income
taxes that exceed 1 percent of adjusted gross income. $700 million.
   MEDICARE: Extend the 1.45 percent Medicare premium (collected as
part of the Social Security tax) to wages above $51,300, the
present taxable maximum. This would affect the wealthiest 6 percent
of employees. $3.5 billion. Bush has a separate proposal that is
unpopular in Congress: require all state and local government
workers to pay for Medicare; those hired before April 1, 1986, are
now exempt. $1.2 billion.
   FRINGE BENEFITS: Impose a 3 percent tax on the value of
employer-paid fringe benefits, except pensions. $2.6 billion.
   CREDIT UNIONS: Tax them just as banks are taxed. $400 million.
   ENVIRONMENTAL: Impose new taxes on a wide variety of pollutants.
Rostenkowski proposed $3.2 billion from this source.
   BUSINESS MEALS: Allow a deduction for only 50 percent, rather
than the current 80 percent, of the cost of business meals and
entertainment. $2 billion.
   STOCKS: Impose a 50-cent tax on the sale of each $100 worth of
stocks and other securities. $7.8 billion.
   MORTGAGES: Limit the interest deduction for home mortgages to
$12,000 on a single return and $20,000 on a joint return. $600
million.
   AVIATION: Raise the 8 percent tax on domestic airline tickets to
10 percent, with similar increases for air cargo and fuel, as Bush
has proposed. $500 million.
   ENERGY: Tax all energy at 5 percent of value. $14.2 billion. Or,
tax all imported oil at $5 a barrel. $8.5 billion.
   ENERGY INDUSTRY: Repeal immediate deduction of certain
intangible drilling costs, such as labor, claimed by oil and gas
explorers. $500 million.

<HEAD>Louisiana Senate Passes Tough Anti-Abortion Law Despite Veto
Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Louisiana Senate ignored a
threatened gubernatorial veto in passing what would be the nation's
strictest state abortion law _ a measure outlawing abortion even in
cases of rape or incest.
   ``There's no indication at all that he's changed his mind about
a veto,'' Gov. Buddy Roemer's spokesman, Rusty Jabour, said
Tuesday. Roemer has said he would veto any bill that does not
include exceptions for rape and incest.
   The bill would send doctors who perform abortions to prison for
up to 10 years of hard labor. Women who obtain abortions would not
be prosecuted.
   The House passed a version of the bill last week and was to get
the measure again, possibly as early as today, to vote on
amendments the Senate added to clarify that abortion would be
allowed to save the life of the mother.
   The bill is designed as a direct challenge to the 1973 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs. Wade that recognized the right to
an abortion. Abortion foes see the Louisiana measure as a way to
get the court to reconsider.
   ``To find out that the Supreme Court really believes, we need a
law that flies in the face of Roe vs. Wade,'' says Mike Cross,
Senate sponsor of the bill.
   If Roemer vetoes the measure, anti-abortion forces said they
will seek an override.
   The 104-member House approved the bill 74-27, four votes more
than the two-thirds majority needed for an override. The vote in
the 39-member Senate on Tuesday was 24-15, two votes shy of what
would be needed for an override.
   ``We know who we have to work on,'' said Rep. Woody Jenkins, the
bill's author.
   ``We know we have the governor's veto and we know we have the
votes to sustain it,'' said Robin Rothrock, leader of an
abortion-rights coalition.
   Sen. Ron Landry, a Democrat, offered an amendment to allow
first-trimester abortions for rape and incest, but he lost 12-27 on
one try and 13-26 on another.
   About 200 abortion opponents packed the balcony and either side
of the Senate chamber during the sometimes emotional, 4{-hour
debate. They broke into thunderous applause and cheers after the
vote.
   Later, about 70 abortion rights advocates marched from the
Capitol to the governor's mansion nearby, chanting pro-choice
slogans. Jubilant abortion opponents gathered on the Capitol steps
to congratulate Jenkins.
   During Tuesday's debate, several senators said the issue will be
politically costly.
   ``There are men in this Senate who will vote _ on both sides _
who will be defeated because of their vote,'' said Sen. Fritz
Windhorst, a Democrat from New Orleans who voted for the bill.
   Cross' opening statement drew heavily on House testimony from a
geneticist, Jerome Lejeune of Paris, who contended that life begins
at conception and that the fertilized egg already contains the
genes to make a unique human being.
   He held up a 3-inch-long pink plastic model of a fetus and said,
``This is what this bill is all about today _ whether or not these
little boys and girls are going to have a chance to live.''
   But Sen. Sydney Nelson said parents must face agonizing
decisions when faced with the impending birth of a defective child.
He also said some children are never adopted.
   ``As a father and a lawyer and a Christian, I've reached the
conclusion that this is not an appropriate bill for us to pass,''
Nelson said.
   The debate came one day after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
Minnesota and Ohio laws requiring minors to notify their parents or
a judge before having an abortion.

<TEXT>
   A grisly sign of civil war stands at the
shattered center of this remote Liberian town _ the skull of a
government soldier, his scalp and half his face withering in the
relentless sun.
   The head is impaled on a stake near a gutted armored personnel
carrier that residents say was one of two that burst into town
before dawn April 1.
   Rebels said they shot out the six tires of the vehicle, bearing
the markings of the Liberian army's 1st Battalion Infantry, and
immolated the half-dozen soldiers inside with firebombs.
   Surrounding buildings are riddled with bullet holes and the dirt
road is still littered with empty cartridges. Survivors say about
60 of Kpaytuo's 1,000 residents were killed by marauding soldiers
of the widely hated military of President Samuel K. Doe.
   It is the kind of carnage that could resume with the collapse of
peace talks this week between representatives of Doe and Charles
Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front rebels.
   Burned-out or abandoned villages, destroyed automobiles and
looted homes and shops dot the inhospitable Liberian interior. The
violence is part of the 6-month-old war between the rebels _
primarily of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups _ and Mandingos and the
Krahns who support Doe, a Krahn.
   ``There have been many clashes in the country and we are
suffering,'' said Thomas Karngbeae, a high school history teacher
in Kpaytuo whose best friend was killed. ``They come to the
villages to harrass and kill innocent people.''
   In nearby Bahn, 125 miles from the Atlantic coast, the area
around the town's center crossroads was flattened and burned.
``Most of our brothers and sisters were killed by Doe's soldiers,''
fumes Peter Vaye, Bahn's deputy military police commander.
   ``The Krahn soldiers burned our food storerooms, so we are
suffering for food,'' says Vaye, his white clothes filthy with
grime. Dozens of people were killed, he says.
   Karnue, an 85-year-old farmer wearing a tattered blue smock,
remembers when the soldiers came to town that night in early April.
``They just drove in and burned houses,'' he said. He said four of
his children died in the raid.
   Taylor, a former Doe administration official, led his insurgent
forces into Liberia in December from neighboring Ivory Coast. The
rebels are within 15 miles of Monrovia, and say they can seize the
capital in 12 hours.
   Rebel spies are helping prepare the attack, says Commander Bobby
Hayes, chief of rebel intelligence. ``Our men traveled to Monrovia
and went downtown. We see there is very little to stop us.''
   ``If ordered to attack we can take Monrovia in a day,'' says
Tiagen Wantee, the Front's deputy battle group commander for the
port of Buchanan, who says he was trained by Green Berets in the
United States and the Special Anti-Terrorism Unit in Israel. ``We
did not start this war to stay in Buchanan.''
   The guerrillas are trained in Gborplay, a northern Liberian
village scraped out of the rain forest near the border with Ivory
Coast.
   By day the people of Gborplay work in nearby fields of corn,
rice and cassava, a potato-like tuber, as wild parrots whistle and
chatter overhead.
   They return home before nightfall _ there is no electricity _
when the fireflies come out among coffee bushes and jungle beasts
begin their haunting calls from the surrounding jungle.
   Atrocities by Doe's soldiers have galvanized the largely Gio and
Mano population of the north. Tales abound of Doe soldiers tying
women and children to mattresses and setting them on fire.
   Sam Belleh, a Mano who trains rebel guerrillas in Gborplay, says
he saw government soldiers murder his friend's wife, who was eight
months pregnant. ``They cut her open and took out the baby. The
baby was stabbed many times. I couldn't stand the sight and fled in
the bush.''
   Soldiers also threw young children into wells, Belleh said. He
thinks about 800 were killed in that December attack at Saclepea,
also in the north.
   Commando trainees, most barefoot, are put through exercises by
John Teah, 29, a deputy training commander.
   Teah, in combat fatigues and wearing a large brass cross around
his neck, also leads daily sessions of a beautiful chorus: half
African ballad, half U.S. Marine Corps drill chants.
   ``Everywhere we go, people want to know, who we are,'' sing
several hundred recruits, marching in place. ``So, we tell them: we
are special commandos marching to the towns.''
   Rebel recruits include 12-year-old Anthony Slersue, who carries
a loaded machine gun slung from his shoulder. He says his older
sister and brother were killed by the Liberian army.
   Christopher Nyeneken, 14, a Mano from Sannequellie, is learning
to be a guerrilla ``to free Liberia. And because they killed my
father.''
   But life in the camp is tough; one young teen-ager tugged at a
visitor's sleeve, saying, ``Sir, we are hungry.''
   Their inexperience can have tragic consequences. During the
battle for Buchanan last month Daniel Zuu was reaching for a
machine gun reloaded by a 12-year-old when the youngster
accidentally pulled the trigger, nearly emptying the magazine into
Zuu's elbow.
   Zuu, 40, lost his left arm, but says that won't keep him from
the war front. ``I will never retreat,'' he says stubbornly. ``I
will never surrender.''

<HEAD>Broiler Production Spreading From Traditional Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's broiler belt hasn't changed much
over the years, but the Agriculture Department says production is
spilling over into other states.
   ``For example, Oklahoma and Missouri more than doubled the
number of broilers they raised from 1980 to 1989, reflecting a
spillover from adjoining Arkansas,'' a report said. ``Other states
raising more broilers include Tennessee, South Carolina and
Pennsylvania.''
   But the broiler industry is still concentrated in 10 states,
which accounted for 83 percent of the U.S. output last year. Most
are in the South, which produced 4.8 billion birds in 1989, or 87
percent of the total.
   Arkansas was the leader with about 920 million broilers last
year, followed by Georgia, with 812 million, and Alabama, with 750
million.
   Others states in the top 10 include North Carolina, Mississippi,
Texas, Maryland, Delaware, California and Virginia.
   The report by Lee Christensen and Agnes Perez of the UDSA's
Economic Research Service was included in the July issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``Although some of this spillover does not reflect major
regional production shifts, further growth in traditional broiler
areas is becoming increasingly constrained by environmental and
economic pressures,'' the report said. ``High concentrations of
broilers result in increasingly complex problems associated with
waste management, water quality and animal disease.''
   Also, as city sprawl develops near major broiler production
centers, land prices and labor costs rise, thus adding to operating
costs.
   ``Areas with underemployed resources, lighter population
densities and fewer environmental pressures sometimes offer
financial and other incentives to attract broiler complexes,'' the
report said.
   Broiler production grew from 3.7 billion pounds, ready-to-cook
weight, in 1960 to 17.3 billion pounds in 1989. This year's output
is estimated at 18.6 billion pounds.
   ``Industry development in the broiler belt was pushed by local
entrepreneurs and aided by the readily available and relatively
low-cost work force,'' the report said. ``In addition, a warm
climate helped reduce energy costs while growers used improved
production technologies that adapted well to the South.''
   As production grew, a large infrastructure of support developed,
including slaughter and processing plants.
   The report said a 1989 industry survey of the 52 largest broiler
companies showed that the largest four accounted for 45 percent of
the total volume through 76 slaughter and ``further processing''
plants.
   The survey also found that the top eight companies accounted for
about 60 percent of the volume in 105 plants, and that the largest
20 firms had 80 percent of the volume in 156 plants.
   Approximately 75 percent of the slaughter plants surveyed were
in the top 10 broiler states, the report said.

   Wind erosion eased its grip on the Great
Plains this season because of improved moisture conditions in much
of the region, according to a final survey by the Agriculture
Department.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Tuesday that an estimated 7.8 million acres were
damaged by wind in the 10 states that make up the Great Plains,
down 45 percent from 14.3 million acres in 1988-89.
   The agency measures wind damage during a seven-month season that
runs from Nov. 1 through May 31, when winds are usually the
strongest and soils the driest. The survey covers 541 counties in
the 10 states.
   ``Most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in
Colorado and Kansas, where land damaged from wind decreased from
6.5 million acres last year to 463,000 acres this year for the two
states,'' Scaling said.
   The greatest damage was in North Dakota, in its third year of
severe drought, he said. The state reported 2.9 million acres
damaged this season, compared with 2.3 million last year and a
record 3.5 million acres in 1987-88.
   North Dakota accounted for more than one-third of the total wind
erosion in the 10-state region.
   Kansas, after setting a record with 5.1 million acres damaged
last year (largely because of a one-day storm that damaged nearly
4.8 million acres), reported only 190,000 acres damaged this season.
   The least damage was in Nebraska, with 130,000 acres damaged,
compared with 192,000 last year.
   Officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the Great
Plains was 15.3 million acres in 1954-55, the year that the agency
began annual records.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
wind-damaged acres in 1989-90 with damage in 1988-89, included:
   _Colorado, 273,731 and 1,403,655.
   _Kansas, 189,600 and 5,126,250.
   _Montana, 1,249,665 and 1,832,025.
   _Nebraska, 130,115 and 191,605.
   _New Mexico, 248,500 and 117,950.
   _North Dakota, 2,932,687 and 2,297,681.
   _Oklahoma, 136,800 and 111,930.
   _South Dakota, 601,830 and 678,550.
   _Texas, 1,668,000 and 1,979,626.
   _Wyoming, 407,550 and 552,680.

   An additional $11 million has been reallocated
to 46 states for the Agriculture Department's special supplemental
food program for women, infants and children.
   About half the states were running out of money for the program,
known as WIC. Higher food costs, especially for dairy and citrus
products, were said to be the main factors.
   Officials said Tuesday the department regularly reallocates
unspent and carryover WIC funds to states in need or in danger of
running out before the end of the fiscal year.
   ``Many states have managed their WIC caseloads carefully enough
that they aren't having any budgetary problems,'' said Betty Jo
Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and Nutrition
Service.
   ``Others have had to economize ... by choosing less expensive
but nutritious foods,'' she said.
   Nationally, the reallocated money will allow states to provide
an additional 300,000 food packages to participants over the final
three months of this fiscal year, Nelsen said.
   The funds will be available to states July 1 and will supplement
more than $2 billion allocated for WIC in the current fiscal year
that began last Oct. 1. More than 4.5 million women, infants and
children participate.

<TEXT>
   Just as in the American civil rights movement
a quarter century ago, the question of violence versus nonviolence
in a struggle for human rights hung over Nelson Mandela's visit to
Washington.
   The black South African leader received a thunderous ovation
after a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, a
reception that left him pausing in the aisle afterward to wave to
members of Congress and the crowded gallery.
   Behind him, a white Republican, Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut,
slapped high fives with black congressmen.
   Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, couldn't help but feel
a bit of astonishment at the scene. Lewis is a veteran of the civil
rights struggle of the 1960s who remained dedicated to nonviolence
despite 40 arrests and vicious attacks during the Freedom Rides and
elsewhere.
   His last arrest, Lewis recalled after Mandela's speech, was in
January 1966 outside the South African Information Center in New
York City. He and other members of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee were protesting South Africa's apartheid
system and its imprisonment of Mandela.
   ``I never thought I'd live to see Nelson Mandela out of jail,''
Lewis said.
   Mandela, who spent 27 years imprisoned, made only slight
reference to the use of violence as a tool in the black struggle
against South Africa's racist system. He said ``those who care to
worry about violence in our country, as we do,'' should look not at
blacks who are denied full rights but at whites ``steeped in the
ideology of racism.''
   But the issue of violence remained a point of disagreement after
Mandela's visit with President Bush and his meetings with members
of Congress.
   Several lawmakers echoed Bush's call for Mandela to renounce
violence, a step the black leader would not take.
   ``Mandela has been given plenty of opportunities to renounce
violence. He has not,'' said Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich.
   ``I hope that's coming in the future,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Lewis, who is black, said he also wanted Mandela to renounce
violence.
   ``I would like to see a nonviolent revolution, a peaceful
transition in South Africa,'' he said. ``There's been too much
violence, too much bloodshed.''
   Mandela's next stop on his U.S. tour is Atlanta, where he is to
visit the burial place of Martin Luther King Jr., the museum that
honors his life and the Ebenezer Baptist Church pulpit where he
preached his message of nonviolent struggle against segregation.
   ``I hope by going to the South he will see what's happened in a
region where there was discrimination, segregation,'' Lewis said.
``He will be in a region of the country that was a lot like South
Africa just a few years ago.
   ``Without violence, we were able to turn the South into a New
South,'' he said. ``Maybe being there will give him the will to
try, as much as possible, to avert violence.''
   Watching Mandela's speech from the House gallery was Jesse
Jackson.
   In an interview afterward, Jackson accused Bush of hypocrisy for
pressing the issue of nonviolence.
   He said Bush has used violence by invading Panama and by sending
weapons to Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Angolan rebels.
   ``His use of the word `violence' was diversionary, from
apartheid, just as his using the word `quotas' is diversionary from
the issue of signing the 1990 Civil Rights Bill,'' Jackson said.
   ``If (South African President F.W.) de Klerk is not making the
renunciation of violence the precondition (to negotiations),
because he can't morally justify it, neither should Mandela have to
do that,'' Jackson said.
   Mandela has advocated the use of violence only as a last resort,
said Edwin Dorn, deputy director of the Joint Center for Political
Studies, a black think tank.
   ``I'm perplexed at this administration's preoccupation with that
subject,'' Dorn said. ``The administration has not shied away from
the use of violence in other parts of the world.''
   Rather than comparing the South African struggle over apartheid
with the American struggle over civil rights, Dorn said a better
analogy was to the U.S. civil war and the fight against slavery.
   Lewis said he did not believe Mandela's refusal to renounce
violence damages his cause in the United States. He cited Mandela's
calm demeanor and demonstration of no bitterness despite his own
imprisonment.
   ``That's very in keeping with the philosophy of nonviolence, to
be able to forgive and go on,'' Lewis said.

<HEAD>Teachers' Union Leader Wins Democratic Runoff For Alabama Governor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Teachers union leader Paul Hubbert won
the Democratic nomination for governor in a caustic campaign
against Attorney General Don Siegelman and will face Gov. Guy Hunt
in November.
   The Democrats clasped hands in a show of unity after the runoff
Tuesday, and Hubbert said, ``I think the nightmare of 1986 is
over'' _ a reference to the party split that enabled Hunt to become
Alabama's first GOP governor this century.
   ``For those misguided souls who think the Democrats are not
together,'' Hubbert said, ``they've got another think coming in
November.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Hubbert received an
unofficial 307,982 votes, or 54 percent, to 266,213 votes, or 46
percent, for Siegelman.
   Hubbert, 54, spent 21 years building the Alabama Education
Association into a political force with 70,000 members ranging from
janitors and bus drivers to teachers and professors.
   Making his first run for statewide public office, he led a
six-candidate field in the primary June 5 but failed to win a
majority, requiring Tuesday's runoff between the two top
vote-getters.
   Siegelman, a 44-year-old Statehouse veteran, made a trip to
Hubbert's victory celebration to pledge his support.
   ``A new battle begins tomorrow,'' he said. ``We will bring
Alabama into the New South with a Democratic progressive governor
in office.''
   During the three-week runoff campaign, Siegelman attacked
Hubbert as a special interest ``backroom operator'' who helped
teachers at the expense of children. Hubbert accused Siegelman of
running a racist radio commercial.
   Hubbert traveled with a mop and bucket in hand as he urged
Siegelman to clean up the campaign. Hubbert also made joking
references to Siegelman's use of marijuana in college.
   Hubbert said the negative ads and verbal slugging in the runoff
won't hurt his campaign against Hunt, who won renomination against
token opposition June 5.
   Hunt, a 56-year-old fruit farmer and preacher who was a
little-known figure when he was catapulted into the governor's
office in a 1986 landslide, predicted a tough campaign.
   But he added, ``I think by the time the summer's over, the
people will know the difference between the candidates.''

   Scientific efforts to save the world's tigers
finally yielded tangible results: a wiggly, yellow and black
test-tube cub named Mary Alice.
   The 20-pound Bengal tiger, one of three cubs produced by in
vitro fertilization, was introduced at the National Zoo on Tuesday.
Mary Alice, the only cub that survived, was born on April 27 by
cesarean section from a surrogate Siberian tiger.
   Her birth marks a milestone in efforts by zoos to save rare
tigers from extinction using in vitro fertilization. Today, there
are fewer tigers in the wild than in the world's zoos _ including
only 31 black-footed cats, 21 sand cats and 12 pallas cats in zoos.
   ``This is a celebration of what we think is a great scientific
achievement,'' said David Wildt, chief reproductive physiologist at
the National Zoo. ``We can produce cubs by animals who are no
longer fertile or have been apart for a long time.''
   Natural feline reproduction in zoos hasn't been successful
because most cats are picky about mates and sometimes refuse to
breed naturally. Genetically desirable mates often are some
distance away and transporting them is risky, said officials at the
zoo's Center for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all are threatened or endangered
with extinction except the domestic cat. Since 1969, three
subspecies of tigers have become extinct, center officials said.
   Animals are considered endangered if they are not reproducing
quickly enough and if their numbers are declining rapidly.
   Scientists have been trying to adapt human artificial
reproduction techniques to wild animals for nearly 10 years, said
Robert Hoage, the National Zoo's public affairs director.
   Artificial breeding techniques have been successful in farm
livestock. But adapting the procedures to conserve rare species has
been slow, Hoage said.
   Ann Miller, a member of the zoo's reproductive physiology unit,
said the breeding is at a snail's pace because ``scientists know so
little about the basic reproductive characteristics of most
wildlife species.''
   But zoos have seen some success _ including an Indian desert cat
born to a surrogate domestic cat using in vitro fertilization at
the Cincinnati Zoo and a gaur calf born to a Holstein cow through
embryo transfer at the Bronx Zoo.
   Intervention has prevented many tiger species from becoming
extinct in the wilderness, zoo officials said.
   ``Sometimes people use the words _ captive and research _ as
four-letter words,'' said Lee Simmons, director of Nebraska's Henry
Doorly Zoo. ``This animal's relatives are captive in Siberia and
other countries ... The habitats for many animals are in isolated
enclaves.''
   When natural habitats are destroyed, tigers are limited to a
small roaming area that keeps them isolated from other tiger
species. When they are isolated, tigers inbreed, and the species
begins to die from reproductive problems, juvenile mortality and
disease susceptibility, said Simmons.
   The National, Henry Doorly and Minnesota zoos have worked
together on the tiger reproduction effort.

   Opponents of a protective U.S. sugar policy
are citing Bush administration support for their stand as they seek
a 10 percent reduction in sugar price levels in the 1990 farm bill.
   ``We're advocating a small reduction in price that the
administration supports,'' Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., said Tuesday.
   Downey gave an early taste of the debate that sugar beet and
cane farmers will witness when floor action on the farm bill begins
next month.
   ``You have gotten away with murder and I don't blame you for
wanting to continue it,'' Downey told a conference of the American
Sugar Alliance.
   He and Rep. Willis Gradison, R-Ohio, faced off against Reps.
Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House Agriculture sugar
subcommittee, and Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., in a panel
discussion.
   Huckaby and Stangeland strongly support the program that keeps
U.S. sugar prices higher than the world market, but Huckaby
acknowledged that the administration is not as enthusiastic.
   He said he feared the administration saw the sugar program as
something that could be traded away in exchange for concessions
from other countries during international trade talks aimed at
reducing subsidies worldwide.
   One of the arguments Downey and Gradison are using against the
sugar program involves trade.
   ``How can we over a long period of time, as we move toward
multi-trade agreements, sustain differences between agricultural
and non-agricultural trade policies,'' said Gradison.
   The current sugar policy, which is extended through 1995 in the
farm bill, holds domestic prices at 22 cents a pound, about 9 cents
more than the average world price, by controlling the amount of
sugar that can be imported from sugar-producing nations.
   Downey said sugar is not so unique a commodity that it has to be
treated differently from other products whose prices ebb and flow
with the market.
   But Huckaby and Stangeland contended that food differs from
other items because is needed for human survival, giving the
government a responsibility to regulate supplies and prices.
   ``We don't want feast or famine,'' said Huckaby.
   Furthermore, he and Stangeland said, price-distorting subsidies
on sugar from Europe necessitate U.S. government protection of
American growers.
   Stangeland said sugar-producing countries take what they need
for themselves, sell to preferred customers and the highest rates
possible and then dump the rest on the world market at low prices,
often subsidized by their governments.
   Downey and Gradison said that by protecting sugar producers in
the United States where sugar is not an ideal crop, the government
is stifling economic development in countries that U.S. officials
say they want to help.
   Forty nations are allowed to export to the United States and
each has a limit on the tonnage they can sell here. Many of the
countries are desperately poor, although they have excellent
climates for growing sugar cane and could sell much more than their
quota.
   ``It doesn't make any sense to not allow sugar imports from
countries we are paying foreign aid,'' Downey said.

   Abbas Taghizaden pointed to his new home,
a tent, up an arid valley from the town where more than half his
neighbors died last week.
   ``I only have this and my land left, so I don't know how I can
build a house. I don't know how I can live,'' he said.
   Many others were in the same position.
   Virtually all of Kelishom's mud brick houses collapsed in
Thursday's earthquake, which killed up to 3,000 of the town's 5,000
people.
   Across northwestern Iran, the earthquake devastated scores of
similar villages whose impoverished residents had relied on
traditional building materials such as mud bricks.
   In larger towns and cities, residents said Tuesday that shoddy
construction contributed to the high death toll.
   In Rasht on the Caspian Sea, for example, 60 people died when
one of the city's most modern apartment buildings collapsed,
neighbors said.
   Dozens of relatives watched Tuesday as huge cranes lifted
portions of the crushed building, searching for the bodies of 24
people still missing.
   ``Some of my family are in there,'' said a young soldier. ``They
haven't found them yet. Maybe they are alive, or maybe they are
dead. I don't know.''
   Many of the relatives and neighbors said officials had allowed
the builder to add a floor _ and that led to the structure's
collapse.
   Nearby, a 40-year-old factory stood without any visible damage.
   Much of the city's water supply remained out as workers repaired
the main reservoir.
   ``There is so much corruption. This (the water system) should
have withstood the earthquake,'' an architecture student said.
   Throughout the city, there was little damage to older buildings,
even those made of fragile-looking brick. Newer, concrete buildings
were seriously damaged.
   The worst-hit rural provinces were Gilan and Zanjan provinces,
where 342 villages, towns and cities were demolished. Kelishom is
in Gilan.
   ``Of the houses that are damaged, most were made of poor quality
materials,'' said Gholam Reza Naghdi, one of two medical school
volunteers in the village helping the injured. ``I think the reason
for the huge damage was our poor economy. For that reason we need
help from other countries.''
   Some victims blamed the government. Others defended it.
   ``Since the current government took over, all we see is dying,
dying,'' said a man who gave only his first name, Jalal. ``Some the
government killed. Others died during the war with Iraq. Now more
died in the earthquake. The economy is down to zero. I hope we can
have some change.''
   At Kelishom, a woman who lost eight members of her family in the
quake expressed gratitude to the government for providing a tent
and food.
   ``But it's cold at night,'' she said. ``I just hope that we will
be able to move into our own houses again some day.''

   The first problem cropped up at about 4 a.m., and it took until

<HEAD>Zumwalt Blasts Government Attitude on Dioxin Dangers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former commander who ordered the spraying of
Agent Orange in Vietnam says veterans aren't the only ones to
suffer from the government's refusal to recognize the herbicide's
trail of cancer and birth defects.
   Testifying Tuesday before a House Government Operations
subcommittee, retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. said the
government's attitude casts doubt on how honestly it is dealing
with dioxin exposure in the environment.
   Agent Orange, used in highly concentrated form to remove crops
and enemy cover, was contaminated during its manufacture with
dioxin, an unwanted byproduct that the Environmental Protection
Agency considers to be a probable cause of cancer.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control, however, says it cannot
study the health effects of Agent Orange exposure on veterans
because it is impossible to determine reliably who was exposed when
jungles were sprayed to deprive enemy troops of cover.
   Veterans groups contend that military records can match spraying
activities with troop movements. Agent Orange
   Zumwalt, who commanded naval forces in Vietnam, reported to
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski in May that the
government and industry ``intentionally manipulated or withheld
compelling information on the adverse health effects'' associated
with exposure to the ingredients of Agent Orange.
   Key among those ingredients is dioxin, although scientists at
Tuesday's hearing said other contaminants may also be blamed for
cancers, birth defects and other afflictions.
   ``... The flawed scientific studies and manipulated conclusions
are not only unduly denying justice to Vietnam veterans suffering
from exposure to Agent Orange, they are now standing in the way of
a full disclosure to the American people of the likely health
effects of exposure to toxic dioxins,'' said Zumwalt.
   He reiterated charges by outside scientists that two influential
industry-sponsored studies on plant accidents used fraudulent data,
and that scientists refuse to use animal data clearly showing a
connection between dioxin exposure and disease.
   ``While dioxin apologists concede dioxin's carcinogenic effects
on animals, they insist that humanity has a miraculous dispensation
from the harmful effects dioxin wreaks on other species of the
animal kingdom,'' he said.
   Derwinski retained Zumwalt last fall as an unpaid adviser to
help resolve the Agent Orange question, which has been debated for
two decades.
   Since Derwinski took over last year as head of the Veterans
Affairs Department, compensation to veterans has begun.
   Without stating outright that Agent Orange exposure was the
cause, the VA has decided to compensate the few thousand veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcomas, both rare
forms of cancer.
   Zumwalt said in his report May 5 to Derwinski that based on his
review of scientific literature, those two cancers and 25 other
afflictions should be considered to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Derwinski chose Zumwalt because of his unique position. As a
commander, he ordered the herbicide to be used. Among those serving
in Vietnam at the time were Zumwalt's son Elmo, who later died of
Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Other witnesses said Tuesday that more attention needs to be
focused on both key ingredients of Agent Orange, not just the one,
2,4,5-T, that was contaminated with dioxin.
   They said the other ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and
other ailments linked to Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D
was also contaminated with harmful compounds, some related to
dioxin, they said.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   The farm-chemical industry believes further research into 2,4-D
is needed, but the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it exists at all, industry
spokesman Garry Hamlin said in a telephone interview from
Indianapolis.

<HEAD>Hot Dog Recall Expands To Cover Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is
voluntarily expanding its recall last week of 22,000 pounds of
frankfurters to include grocery stores nationwide, the Agriculture
Department says.
   Officials said Tuesday the recalled franks are suspected to
being contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause
listeriosis, a potentially serious disease.
   In an initial recall on June 22, the company and USDA said the
franks were distributed to stores in unspecified states in the
Northeast.
   ``However, further investigation revealed the franks were
distributed in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Texas,'' the department
said.
   The product, labeled ``Schneider's Franks,'' is sold in
one-pound plastic packages. The words ``Canada 35'' appear inside
the inspection seal on the label. All bearing the ``Best before''
date of ``Jul 03'' are being recalled.
   ``Although no illnesses have been associated with listeria,
several consumer complains are being investigated,'' said Ronald J.
Prucha, associate administrator of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
   Prucha said consumers should return the suspected franks to the
place of purchase. None of the company's other products are
involved in the recall.
   The problem was said to have been discovered May 31 in a routine
USDA import reinspection in Buffalo, N.Y. Laboratory tests
confirmed the bacterial contamination on June 20.

<HEAD>Unexpected Price Rises Forcing Cuts in WIC Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp food price increases and rebate
reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million low-income
pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition
program, according to a survey.
   ``Between March 1990 and September 1990, the end of the current
fiscal year, our survey found that at least 240,000 participants
would no longer be served by the WIC program,'' Dennis Bach,
president of the National Association of WIC directors, said
Tuesday.
   Bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their
monthly participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.
   The program provides needy women and children with vouchers
redeemable at grocery stores for food, including milk, cheese,
juices and cereals.
   Since May 1989 the Consumer Price Index shows that milk prices
have risen 10.7 percent, cheese costs have climbed 12.7 percent and
fruit juices and frozen fruit prices have risen 13.8 percent.
   Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion for the current fiscal
year. Bach said an additional $72 million was needed to prevent the
reductions.
   The House approved a fiscal 1991 increase of $235 million,
including $85 million to maintain current services and $150 million
for program expansion.
   But Bach said the $150 million ``could be eaten up to maintain
current levels.''

<HEAD>Soviet Heart Drug is Licensed by Du Pont</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new treatment for life-threatening heartbeat
irregularities is believed to be the first Soviet drug licensed by
a U.S. pharmaceutical company and approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   Officials of Du Pont Co. said the drug, which will be marketed
under the brand name Ethmozine, is the most widely used in the
Soviet Union to treat the heart condition known as ventricular
arrhythmia.
   The drug appears to be safer than the eight others in its class
for patients who have had congestive heart failure, company
officials said.
   Side effects, which include nausea and dizziness, occurred in 10
percent to 15 percent of patients, said Wilmington, Del.-based Du
Pont.
   Ethmozine, also known generically as moricizine, was one of
three drugs studied by the National Institutes of Health in a
clinical trial aimed at assessing the increased risk of sudden
death in people who have an abnormal heart rhythm following a heart
attack.
   The two other drugs, Tambocor and Enkaid, were removed from the
trial and new restrictions on them were ordered by the FDA when
researchers found that patients on the treatments were dying
unexpectedly.
   The trial is continuing with Ethmozine along with placebos.
   About 800,000 to 1.2 million Americans are being treated for
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, said Kurt Landgraf,
worldwide director of Du Pont Pharmaceuticals. Arrhythmias are
related to more than 300,000 deaths each year.
   The drug, developed in the Soviet Union in 1964, will be
marketed by Du Pont under an agreement in which the Soviets will
receive royalties of 4 percent on worldwide sales, Landgraf said.
   The drug will be available in the United States in September.

<HEAD>Spot the Danger in Whirling, Chopping Blades</HEAD>

   'Tis the season to be careful, lest lawn and
garden work lead to lacerated feet and fingers _ or worse.
   Lawn mowers, electric hedge trimmers and other power tools
greatly ease the burden of caring for the outdoors. But they also
pose serious hazards for the unwary, the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission warns.
   Newer lawn mowers have devices that cause the blade to stop
turning when the operator lets go of the handle, a system designed
to prevent hand injury.
   But many older mowers remain in use, and owners of those
machines can still lose fingers if they try to clean clogged grass
of other problems while the motor is running.
   The solution is simple: Stop the engine before doing anything
beneath the mower deck, even cleaning out a clogged grass chute. It
can pay to disconnect the spark plug so the motor cannot
accidentally turn over.
   And even with hanging guards, mowers can still run over feet if
operators are not careful. The commission suggests always pushing
mowers, trying to pull them toward you rarely, if ever.
   In addition to the threat of cutting off fingers and toes, the
spinning blade can hurl such objects as small stones at high speed.
The safety commission urges keeping children and pets away from the
area being mowed to prevent them being hit by such items.
   Stop the mower before crossing gravel driveways.
   Gasoline-powered movers present the added hazard of burns.
   Adding fuel to a hot mower is extremely dangerous, say safety
officials, who warn that it can suddenly catch fire, especially in
the event of a spill.
   In addition the muffler and other mower parts become very hot
and can cause severe burns if touched.
   Electric mowers have a cord for power that can be a hazard if
accidentally cut, the commission adds.
   With walk-behind mowers, the safety commission suggests mowing
across steep slopes, never up and down.
   Hedge trimmers aren't as dangerous as lawn mowers, but can pose
their own set of dangers, the commission reports.
   The danger of being cut by the blades is obvious, of course.
Those cuts seem to occur most often when people try to use trimmers
with one hand.
   Before plugging in the trimmer, check the on-off switch. The
commission reports that many accidental cuts occur when people plug
the trimmer in while the switch is on and it starts running
accidentally.
   Improper grounding or cutting the electric cord can also lead to
electric shocks, the commission says.
   And officials urge that these machines not be operated around
children and pets, which can accidentally trip an adult or may be
injured by the tool as they are not aware of the danger.

<HEAD>Cabinet Cuts Immigration Numbers, Lets Chinese Students Stay Four
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ALEXANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese students fearing reprisals in
their homeland will be allowed to stay in Australia at least four
more years, but overall immigration quotas will be cut 10 percent
as a result, officials said today.
   The joint announcement by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Immigration Minister Gerry Hand followed a marathon Cabinet meeting
Tuesday.
   The decision will affect nearly 20,000 Chinese students who
arrived by June 20, 1989, a little more than two weeks after
Beijing's bloody crackdown on its pro-democracy movement.
   Many of the students had expressed fears that they might be
punished after they returned home.
   According to the statement today, future human rights conditions
in China will dictate whether the Chinese students can stay beyond
four years or gain permanent residence.
   The Cabinet decision slashed the maximum number of new
immigrants from 140,000 a year to 126,000 to make room for the
Chinese students expected to seek extensions on their stays in
Australia. Ethnic groups did not want further restrictions on
already-tight immigration levels.
   The announcement was likely to draw widespread criticism from
the political opposition, students and leaders of other immigrant
groups.
   The students originally thought they would be allowed to stay
permanently, without condition, after Hawke announced June 6 that a
separate immigration category would be created for them. He then
muddied the situation by saying they could stay temporarily, but
that none would be forced to go back to China.
   The category announced today will allow the Chinese to apply,
beginning in August, for a special four-year residency permit. It
will allow them to work and apply to have their families join them.
   ``Unless we were confident that the situation in (China) was
such that human rights were no longer generally at risk, permanent
residence would be granted to those who apply, subject to normal
health and character checks'' after the four-year extensions
expire, the government said today.
   The Chinese granted permanent residency would be part of the
total number of immigrants allowed into this country of 16 million
people, not a special, additional category.
   Cambodian groups were particularly incensed when Hawke said on
June 6 that Cambodian boat people were seeking to better themselves
economically and should not be granted refugee status.
   Although Hawke said the Cambodian immigrants would be sent home,
immigration officials later said any requests for refugee status
would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   The political opposition has said the immigration claims of
Chinese students also should be considered case-by-case and should
not be given blanket protection.
   On June 3-4 last year, Chinese troops cleared central Beijing of
pro-democracy protesters, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
Thousands of activists were subsequently arrested.
   President Bush in November vetoed a congressional measure that
would have permitted any of the 40,000 Chinese students in the
United States to remain after their visas run out if they fear
reprisal back home.
   Bush, fearing the measure would have further hurt U.S.-Chinese
relations, instead signed an executive order in April saying
Chinese students would not be forced to return home.
   Bush's order directs the attorney general to defer until Jan. 1,
1994, any deportation procedings against Chinese nationals who were
in the United States on or after June 5, 1989, and whose visas
expire.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared
Wednesday, while the dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 154.35 yen, down 0.88 yen from Tuesday's
155.23-yen finish. It opened at 154.33 yen and ranged between
154.00 yen and 154.45 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 740.98 points, or
2.29 percent, ending the day at 3,312,75. The index rose 447.58
points on Tuesday.
   Traders attributed the stock index's surge to the yen's recovery
against the dollar, as well as to the start Wednesday of stock
trading for settlement in July. Stock transactions for each month
begin four days before the end of the previous month due to the
time it takes to complete handling procedures.
   ``The yen's strength greatly contributed to reassuring market
players and prompted active buying,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an
analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's decline followed its
overnight fall in overseas markets, where investors sold because of
expectations of declining U.S. interest rates.
   The trend continued in Tokyo as Japanese institutional
investors, mainly life insurance companies, bought the yen against
the dollar believing a statement by President Bush would lead to
lower U.S. interest rates, dealers said.
   In Washington on Tuesday, Bush said tax revenue increases must
be included in any deficit-reduction package.

<HEAD>Taiwan Holds Meeting to Decide Democratic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians and academics meet Thursday to
try to defuse a constitutional crisis by agreeing on a more
democratic system that would challenge four decades of one-party
rule.
   An opposition leader predicted violence could result if the
National Affairs Conference fails to find a way to give more power
to native Taiwanese, who have been dominated by the ruling
Nationalist Party that retreated to this island from mainland China
in 1949.
   President Lee Teng-hui called for the conference in March after
widespread public demonstrations demanding the scrapping of the
system that has preserved the Nationalists' lock on power.
   ``We would pay a very painful price should the conference fail
to set the direction of reforms in accordance with public
expectations,'' said Chen Yung-hsing, acting chairman of the
nation's largest opposition group, the Democratic Progressive Party.
   He warned of violent demonstrations in case of a deadlock.
   The one-week meeting will be attended by 150 delegates,
including 80 members of the ruling party and 16 representatives
from the Democratic Progressive Party. Independent academics and
politicians account for the bulk of the remaining seats.
   Although President Lee has not explicitly promised to follow
recommendations made by the delegates, it would be difficult for
him to reject a proposal that had broad support from conference
members.
   The debate will focus on what to do with the 1947 constitution,
enacted in China by the Nationalist government two years before it
lost a civil war to the Communists and retreated to the offshore
island now home to 20 million people.
   The Nationalists have since used the constitution as the legal
basis for their political power.
   Claiming to still be the legitimate government of all China, the
Nationalists have not allowed native Taiwanese to vote for a
majority of seats in the national Legislature and the electoral
college. Instead, the party froze in lawmakers elected on the
Chinese mainland more than four decades ago.
   The Nationalists have acknowledged the need for change as the
aging lawmakers from the mainland die off and the increasingly
affluent native Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of the
island's 20 million people, demand more political power.
   The Nationalists are expected to propose changing the
constitution so all members of parliament are elected in Taiwan.
   But the ruling party delegates appear divided over whether the
electoral college should be replaced by presidential elections and
whether the strong presidency should give way to a Cabinet-led
government.
   The Democratic Progressive Party believes that just amending the
constitution does not go far enough and wants to replace it with
what they call a ``Great Charter of Democracy.''
   Opposition delegates say the charter would provide for direct
presidential elections and allow the people of Taiwan to determine
whether they should drop reunification with mainland China as a
national goal.
   But Taiwan independence is vehemently rejected by both the
Nationalists and the Communist government in Beijing, which regards
the island as a renegade province that must return to the fold.
   Perhaps that is why opposition party members suggest the issue
of reunification be put off indefinitely.
   ``We respect the rights and wisdom of our next generation and
will leave some room for them to settle the matter,'' said Huang
Huang-hsiung, a conference delegate who heads the opposition
party's constitution task force.

   A wildfire burning along a mountain ledge
apparently jumped a fireline and killed five inmates and a prison
guard fighting the blaze, authorities said.
   At least four other inmates and another person were injured, one
critically, as the blaze burned 5,000 acres Tuesday in the Tonto
and Coconino National Forests.
   Tanker planes and helicopters backed up about 1,000 firefighters
and support personnel fighting the fire, which was ignited Monday
by lightning.
   More than 500 homes were evacuated and shelters were set up in
Payson, a community 90 miles northeast of Phoenix. The number
evacuated was unclear, since many of the homes are recreational
cabins and vacation homes.
   The six apparently were killed when winds and updrafts off the
rim pushed the blaze past firelines, said Tonto spokesman Bob
Celaya.
   The temperature reached 106 degrees on Tuesday in Payson.
   ``The fire literally seemed to have exploded,'' said Tonto
spokeswoman Joyce Hassell.
   Many of the firefighters were pulled off the fire overnight.
About 80 were assigned to fight the blaze early today, Ms. Hassel
said.
   The inmates were among 18 or 19 prisoners and two officials the
Perryville state prison assigned to the fire, said Corrections
Department spokesman Mike Arra.
   The injured were taken to Maricopa Medical Center in Phoenix.
   One inmate was in critical condition with burns over 40 percent
of his body and smoke inhalation, Arra said. A firefighter was in
guarded condition, fire officials said. The others were being
treated for smoke inhalation, Arra said.

   The theft of $10.8 million from an armored car in Rochester,
N.Y., puts it at or near the top of the list of large robberies
from armored car services in the United States. Here is a list of
some of the top robberies:
   _Dec. 12, 1982, two men broke into the Sentry Armored Car
Courier Co. office in New York City. About $11 million disappeared,
but authorities say only a fraction of that amount may have been
taken by the robbers. Only about $1 million has been recovered, and
investigators say some of the missing money may have been
previously embezzled from the company.
   _Apr. 19, 1985, $7.9 million was stolen from a Wells Fargo depot
in New York after four masked gunmen ambushed and disarmed four
guards.
   _Sept. 12, 1983, a robber made off with $7 million from the
Wells Fargo office in Hartford, Conn., after drugging and tying up
a driver and office manager.
   _Nov. 24, 1983, two armed men held up a Wells Fargo armored car
in Memphis, Tenn., stealing $5.2 million in cash, $750,000 in
negotiable securities and checks, and $500,000 in bonds.
   _Oct. 20, 1974 robbery of $4.3 million from a Purolator Inc.,
building in downtown Chicago.
   _July 19, 1984, members of the neo-Nazi group, The Order, stole
$3.6 from a Brinks armored car near Ukiah, Calif.
   _Dec. 19, 1978, thieves held up a Wells Fargo armored truck on
Staten Island and got away with $2.25 million in bank funds.
   _March 19, 1982, robbers who impersonated FBI agents stole more
than $2 million from a Purolator armored-truck collection center
near Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>Zhao Adviser Reportedly Released from Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has released from prison a key adviser to
Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as Communist Party chief for supporting
some goals of last year's crushed pro-democracy movement, a
newspaper reported today.
   Bao Tong had been private secretary to the former party chief as
well as heading a party think tank on reform.
   The English-language South China Morning Post said he was
released from maximum security Qincheng prison last month and is
under house arrest in Beijing.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Beijing, said an
investigation of Bao's activity during last year's protests yielded
no incriminating information.
   The paper claimed the failure to press charges against Bao was a
setback for hard-liner Premier Li Peng. The report said authorities
have yet to decide what to do with Bao.
   China's official media has said nothing about Bao's case.
   Amnesty International reported that Bao was arrested May 28,
1989, about one week before China's conservative leaders ordered
the military to crush pro-democracy protests.
   Zhao, who was sympathetic to some of the students' demands for
greater political freedoms, was dismissed from all his party posts
June 24, 1989. He was accused of ``supporting the turmoil,'' a
reference to the protests, and of splitting the Communist Party.
   Zhao is believed to be living under house arrest in central
Beijing. He has not been seen in public since May 1989.
   Bao, director of the Research Center for Reform of the Political
Structure under the Communist Party's Central Committee, reportedly
acted as Zhao's liaison to students during the protests.
   One official evaluation of the protests reportedly labeled Bao
and other intellectuals as ``black hands'' behind the movement.
   Since late last year, China has announced the release of more
than 800 people jailed for their participation in the crushed
democracy movement. Thousands more are believed still in jail, most
without being charged or brought to trial.

<HEAD>U.S. Young Men Likelier Homicide Victims Than Other Nationalities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young men in America are more than four times as
likely to be homicide victims as those in 21 other industrialized
nations, and the reason probably is greater access to guns,
researchers say.
   If the rate could be reduced to that of Scotland, the country
with the next highest rate, more than 3,000 lives would be saved
every year, said two researchers at the National Center for Health
Statistics in Hyattsville, Md.
   But a criminology specialist said Tuesday it may be unfair to
compare U.S. homicide rates to those of other countries, as the
study published today does.
   ``Comparisons carry the burden of different societies and legal
systems, etcetera,'' James Wright, a Tulane University sociologist,
said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his New Orleans office.
   Lois Fingerhut and Joel Kleinman said in the study in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association that in 1987 there were
4,223 male homicide victims ages 15 to 24 in the United States, or
21.9 per 100,000.
   That compared to 22 victims, or a rate of 5.0 per 100,000, in
Scotland; Austria's 0.3 rate was the lowest.
   Fingerhut and Kleinman said guns, the cause of 75 percent of
U.S. deaths, might explain the differences. ``While there is no
clear reason, we have to look at the availability of firearms,''
Fingerhut said in a telephone interview.
   France was second in gun homicides, at 54 percent.
   In Washington, Tom Wyld, a spokesman for the National Rifle
Association, had no comment on the study.
   But Wright said the Swiss own guns and have almost no violence.
``They do emphasize responsible firearm ownership much more than we
do,'' he said.'
   According to the NCHS study, only one of 14 homicides in
Switzerland was by firearm.
   ``And, if you subtract all the firearm homicides, we're still
killing loads more people than any other country,'' Wright said.
   U.S. homicides not involving firearms in 1987 outnumbered annual
totals in all other countries combined 3-to-1, or 1,036 to 308,
according to the study.
   Twenty percent of all U.S. homicides occur in the 15- to
24-year-old age group, the researchers said.
   ``In the United States, homicide is the leading cause of death
among black males aged 15 to 24 years, and the third leading
cause'' after autombiles and suicide among white males ages 15 to
24, the study said.
   California had the highest homicide rate, 22.0 per 100,000, for
young men among the 25 largest states. Texas was next, with 20.9.
Minnesota was lowest, with 1.9.
   New York had the highest percentage of firearm homicides: 78
percent of its homicides were committed with guns. Florida had the
lowest, 64 percent.

   The grousing ``Simpsons'' and the bickering
Bundys of ``Married .. With Children'' continue to make TV history
for Fox Broadcasting.
   For the second straight week, the Fox network claimed two top 10
programs, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings released
Tuesday.
   A repeat of ``The Simpsons'' finished in a three-way tie for
10th place last week, and a ``Married ... With Children'' rerun
landed in a three-way tie for seventh.
   Fox's sketch comedy ``In Living Color'' ranked 14th, the best
showing thus far for the acclaimed show.
   During the previous week, the cartoon Simpson family finished
third, the highest rating by a Fox show in the network's four-year
history.
   Virtually all of the highest-rated programs were reruns.
   ``Cheers'' on NBC was No. 1. ``Roseanne'' on ABC was second,
followed by ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Empty Nest'' on NBC. NBC's
``The Seinfeld Chronicles,'' which tied for seventh, was the only
original programming in the top 10.
   NBC was still No. 1 in the overall ratings with a 10.3 average.
ABC was second with a 9. CBS was last, again, with an 8.8. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 households.
   In the network news wars, ABC continued dominate with a 9
average. CBS finished second with 8.3. NBC had an 8.1.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 15.1; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 15; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 13.9;
``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 13.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 13.6; ``Golden
Girls,'' NBC, 13.5; ``Coach,'' ABC, ``Married ... With Children,''
Fox, ``The Seinfeld Chronicles,'' NBC (three-way tie), 13.4; ``A
Different World,'' NBC, ``The Simpsons,'' Fox, ``Designing Women,''
CBS, (three-way tie), 13.3.

<HEAD>Fujimori Seeks Foreign Aid As Peruvians Line Up for Scarce Bread,
Gasoline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori flies to New
York Thursday, seeking aid to help pull his country out of a crisis
that has forced people to line up for scarce supplies of bread,
gasoline and other essentials.
   Officials blame the shortages on panic-buying and the plummeting
value of the inti, the country's currency, which makes imports more
expensive.
   Meanwhile, the government must deal with $20 billion in foreign
debt and 2,000 percent annual inflation.
   ``People whose gas tanks are normally half empty are trying to
fill them up every night. Housewives who normally store one gallon
of kerosene are storing five,'' Pedro Touzett, general manager of
the state-owned oil company Petroperu, told a news conference
Tuesday.
   In Lima, housewives stood in block-long lines to buy cooking
gas. Children waited hours to buy fist-sized loaves of bread.
Hundreds of taxis and buses idled near the few open gas stations.
   The inti lost value by the hour. On the free market it has been
devalued by 48 percent in one week, and by 23 percent since Monday
morning.
   The shortages come five weeks before Fujimori is to be sworn in.
The agronomist, a political unknown at the start of the election
campaign, defeated celebrated novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in a June
10 presidential runoff.
   When he travels to New York on Thursday, Fujimori plans to visit
the United Nations to seek emergency economic aid to finance food
imports.
   He will also travel to Washington to meet with officials of the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Inter-American
Development Bank. He hopes to re-establish ties with international
lenders that were broken by his predecessor, Alan Garcia, who
limited payments on the country's foreign debt.
   Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, will then travel Tokyo
for meetings with Japanese leaders.
   Japan has said it is willing to resume loans to Peru if the
country can show a willingness to deal with its serious social and
economic problems.
   In Lima, the shortages have only added to the problems of the
capital's 7 million residents, who already suffer from daily
blackouts, severe water rationing and runaway inflation.
   Touzett said the shortage of electricity had increased demand
for cooking gas and gasoline to power private generators. The
Petroperu chief said the power shortages also hampered fuel
distribution because gas stations cannot operate their pumps and
natural gas bottlers their machinery.
   The Bread Industry Association attributed the bread shortages to
reduced wheat imports. Peru imports all but 150,000 tons of the 1.2
million tons of wheat the country consumes each year.
   ``Once more we beg the government to import on a bigger scale
and to do so continuously,'' Gilberto Hinojosa Teves of the Bread
Industry Association told reporters Monday.
   But economists say that many imports have been reduced because
of a lack of foreign currency.
   The government has been selling silver and gold to raise money.
The Central Bank reserves stand at $900 million, mostly gold and
silver.
   Centrist politician Manuel Moreyra said Monday that the rapid
devaluation of the inti was due to the government's ``unusual
emission of bills as well as the uncertainty before political
change.''
   The country's problems have been compounded by a severe drought
that has cut crop production and hydroelectric power, and attacks
by Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrillas on power lines.

<HEAD>NASA Says Leak Tests Same as Always</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA says it will run a fuel test on
space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday to assure itself the rest of the
shuttle fleet does not have hydrogen leaks like the one that has
grounded Columbia.
   ``We believe that we don't have a generic-type of a flaw that
should indict the rest of the hardware in the fleet,'' Jack Boykin,
deputy manager of Johnson Space Center's orbiter projects office,
said Tuesday.
   ``We want to prove that to ourselves beyond any reasonable doubt
because there is a potential safety hazard to having a hydrogen
leak.''
   Columbia has been grounded by a tiny fuel leak that forced NASA
to scrub its mission May 30 six hours before liftoff. Hydrogen is
highly combustible. The shuttle was to have carried the $150
million Astro observatory.
   The leak is in the area where the orbiter is connected to the
big external fuel tank. It is thought to be in a valve on the
orbiter, NASA said.
   Up to 200,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen will be
pumped into Atlantis' external tank on Thursday, about half the
tank's capacity, to test its valve. The same test helped NASA
locate generally the leak in Columbia.
   It's unclear whether NASA will launch Atlantis on a secret
military mission in mid-July if the exact cause of Columbia's
problems have not been determined by then.
   Boykin said, ``There are still folks in our community who aren't
committed to that yet.'' The subject will be discussed during a
flight readiness review on Thursday and Friday, he said. A launch
date will then be announced.
   In repairs on Columbia, a 17-inch-diameter valve that carries
liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the main engine was
removed from the tank side, but no leaks were found. The problem
consequently lies on the orbiter side, and the valve from the
unfinished shuttle Endeavour will replace the bad component, NASA
said.
   There is only one such valve on the orbiter side of the shuttle.
The valve on the external tank side is jettisoned along with the
tank minutes after liftoff, and a new valve accompanies every new
tank.
   Columbia's hydrogen lines indicated leakage during a mechanical
test in 1984 to check the valve on the external tank side, Boykin
said. Seven other valves, including the one on Atlantis, also
failed at that time.
   The valve on the external tank side of Columbia and the others
that failed underwent yet another check. Each valve passed that
test, Boykin said.
   Thirty-three of 64 valves made from 1980 to 1986, when the
Challenger explosion temporarily halted production, leaked hydrogen
during the mechanical test, Boykin said. Seventeen were within
acceptable limits, he said.
   The remaining 16 went through the second test and passed, Boykin
said. Nine went on to fly and performed well, he said.
   A similar test was performed with the valves on the orbiter side
of the shuttles, and no problems were detected, Boykin said.
   The valve that apparently is leaking on Columbia was modified
following the Challenger accident and has flown twice without any
problems, he said.

   Much of the nation enjoyed fair weather early today, while
temperatures in Phoenix fell below 100 after reaching a
record-breaking 122 degrees.
   Heat advisories were posted for today and Thursday across the
deserts of San Diego County, Calif. Temperatures in the inland
valleys were expected to reach near 110 degrees, threatening
orchards and vineyards.
   The western Plains and the Southwest sweltered on Tuesday, with
temperatures reaching the 90s as far north as the upper Missouri
Valley. Records for the day were broken from Los Angeles, where the
temperature reached 112 degrees, to Lubbock, Texas, where it was a
scorching 105.
   Authorities said they suspected three deaths in Phoenix and one
in Los Angeles were heat-related.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 122 in Arizona
at Buckeye, Gila Bend, Phoenix, Youngtown and Yuma and in Laughlin,
Nev.
   The National Weather Service predicted it would be just about as
hot today in the Southwest. Only slight cooling was expected by the
weekend as a high-pressure system held fast over New Mexico,
Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
   Today's forecast called for scattered thunderstorms across the
Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Oklahoma, northern Texas, southern
Louisiana, Florida and northern New England. Showers were expected
in northwestern Washington.
   On Tuesday evening, summertime thunderstorms rumbled over the
lower Texas Gulf Coast, the lower Mississippi Valley, South Dakota,
Iowa, western Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over the Carolinas,
Georgia and Florida, and were scattered over parts of Arizona, New
Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and southwest Montana.

<HEAD>National Assembly Approves Ban On Smoking, Alcohol Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly today approved a ban on all
tobacco advertising and most liquor advertising starting in 1993.
   The law, approved on a 315-149 vote, forbids all direct or
indirect advertising for tobacco products, including sponsorships
of sports and cultural events.
   Legislators from wine-growing regions succeeded in excluding
most wines from the ban on liquor advertising.
   All 270 assembly members of the governing Socialist Party backed
the bill, as did 45 independents and centrists. The two main
center-right parties adopted different tactics _ most members of
the Union for French Democracy voted against the bill, while most
members of the Rally for the Republic abstained.
   During a two-day debate on the bill, legislators defeated an
amendment that would have banned sales of tobacco products to
minors under 16 and adopted an amendment prohibiting liquor sales
at service stations.
   According to the government, smoking causes 65,000 deaths and
alcoholism 45,000 deaths each year in France.
   Health Minister Claude Evin, the bill's chief sponsor, said
today's measure is ``without precedent in the history of public
health.''
   The bill is part of an anti-smoking campaign by the government.
Cigarette prices are due to rise by 15 percent later this year, and
the national railroad announced this week that smoking is to be
banned on all of its commuter trains.

<HEAD>Western Europe Moves Ahead With Plans for Political Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans for political union of a dozen West
European countries have moved ahead, but it's still unclear what
the final product will look like.
   Leaders of the European Community wrapped up a two-day summit on
Tuesday by agreeing to open a special conference on Dec. 14 to
sketch in the details.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is confident she has
scotched grandiose plans for some kind of federal Europe.
   ``I think we have won on that,'' she told reporters.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey, host of the summit, said
the leaders wanted to have ``a new, closer, much more integrated
political relationship.''
   There will be, he said, ``a much closer growing together
politically.''
   Some have suggested the community should turn itself into a
federal United States of Europe.
   Others predict a more limited outcome.
   They foresee closer cooperation in foreign policy areas so the
community can play a more influential role on the world stage.
   The European Parliament, the community's legislature, likely
would be strengthened. It would have more say over the European
Commission, the trading bloc's executive body.
   Mrs. Thatcher has opposed any moves that would transfer national
sovereignty to new community agencies.
   To sharpen the debate, aides of the leaders have drawn up a list
of questions that need to be answered before a political union can
be formed.
   The five-page document said the overall goal is to strengthen
the ability of the governments ``to act in the areas of their
common interests.''
   ``The unity and coherence of its policies and actions should be
ensured through strong and democratic institutions,'' it said.
   The paper asked whether new powers should be transferred to the
community from individual governments. It wondered how ``the notion
of community citizenship'' should be dealt with and whether new
agencies should be set up.
   The paper was drawn up after the leaders committed themselves at
an Arpil summit, also held in Dublin, to a political merger by late
1992.
   Their decision was sparked by the political upheavals in Eastern
Europe. The West European nations contend they must offer stability
at a time of uncertainty in Eastern Europe.
   The special conference on political union will run parallel to a
convention, starting Dec. 13, on fashioning an economic and
monetary union.
   The conferences are needed to change the community's founding
Treaty of Rome and set up any new political or monetary agencies.
   Officials want both conferences to finish their work and the
nations to ratify any treaty changes by late 1992.
   That is the date when the nations already are set to create a
European-wide market. To do that, they intend to get rid of the
many trade barriers that bar the free movement of money, people and
products.
   At their summit, the European Community leaders also called on
all South Africans to renounce violence in a declaration that
Britain said was directed squarely at Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress.
   But the leaders of the trade bloc refused to ease sanctions
against South Africa's white-led government, saying they need
``further clear evidence'' that changes to end apartheid will
continue.
   Mrs. Thatcher said it was a ``great pity'' that the EC nations
were ``unable to agree publicly to make a start now on easing
sanctions.''
   Unanimous support by the EC nations is needed to end joint
embargoes imposed in 1986 that banned imports of South African
iron, steel and gold coins.
   The summit also considered a West German and French demand for
$15 billion in immediate aid to help the Soviet Union's
deteriorating economy.
   Most of the other leaders opposed giving money to the Soviet
Union with no clear idea of how it would be used.
   The community ordered its executive commission to undertake with
the World Bank and other international agencies a study of Moscow's
needs.
   Officials said they expected Italy, which takes over the
community's six-month rotating presidency on July 1, to have Soviet
aid proposals ready by fall.

<HEAD>Army Private Convicted of Murdering Civilian During U.S. Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT ORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army private was convicted of
unpremeditated murder of a civilian during the invasion of Panama.
Investigators said she was shot during a gunfight staged to conceal
the loss of a military pistol.
   Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of Philadelphia, faced up to life in
prison and a dishonorable discharge at sentencing today by the
military panel that convicted him after an hour's deliberation
Tuesday.
   ``They crucified him,'' said McMonagle's mother, Patricia.
``They sent him to Panama to give up his life, and they do this to
him. There wasn't enough evidence to support the charges.''
   Sgt. Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., also was charged
with murder in the Jan. 25 shooting. His court-martial begins
Friday.
   McMonagle, of the 7th Light Infantry Division from Fort Ord,
admitted to an investigator that he went to a Panama City bar and
brothel with Finsel, who lost his handgun when the two went into a
back room to evade military police.
   Finsel convinced him that they should fake a firefight and say
the gun was lost in the melee, McMonagle told the investigator. The
two fired their rifles in the air, and soldiers nearby heard the
shots and took up the fake firefight.
   Leila Diaz de Panay, 50, was shot in the abdomen while taking a
bath in the courtyard of her home. McMonagle said he had seen a
shadow and fired six times.
   ``What they did was a terrible, terrible thing. It's a hard
thing to swallow,'' the prosecutor, Capt. Robin Johnson, said in
her closing argument.
   Defense attorney Capt. Norman Allen argued that Finsel was
``belligerent, frantic, agitated'' and in trouble and that
McMonagle simply followed his lead.
   ``If he made a mistake, that's a tragic mistake. ... We
shouldn't offer up McMonagle as a sacrifice. (Mrs. de Panay) wasn't
the only civilian who died,'' he said.
   The defense also offered affidavits from Panamanians in the
neighborhood who said they heard gunfire coming from an apartment
building.
   A third soldier, Pfc. Marc Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N.J., who
accompanied McMonagle and Finsel, testified for the prosecution.
   He pleaded guilty in April to firearms, alcohol and obstruction
charges and was sentenced to two years in prison, demotion and
dishonorable discharge.

<HEAD>Industrialist Convicted for Helping Build Libya Gas Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with more background on trial, quotes from
testimony. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANNHEIM, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state court today convicted a
49-year-old West German industrialist of helping build a poison gas
plant in Libya and sentenced him to five years in prison.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen was found guilty of violating
export laws and tax evasion for his involvement in construction of
the widely publicized plant in the Libyan city of Rabta, south of
Tripoli.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen admitted at his trial earlier this month
that he helped build the chemical plant while he headed the
Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr, a southwestern city near Mannheim.
   The prosecution had asked for a prison term of 6{ years for
Hippenstiel-Imhausen, calling him a ``merchant of death.'' He had
faced a maximum sentence of eight years.
   Defense lawyers sought a briefer sentence, noting that the
defendant had confessed. Judge Juergen Henninger sentenced him to
five years.
   The ruling followed an 11-day trial, one of the most heavily
publicized business trials in West German history.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen said in court on June 13 that he had
suspicions the project ``would be in conflict with West Germany's
export laws'' but did not investigate because he ``didn't want to
lose the business.''
   West German law forbids the export of technology or material
that could be used in conflict areas such as the Middle East.
   Libya has said the Rabta plant was intended for producing
pharmaceuticals, but U.S. and West German officials have said it
was built to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen testified that the Rabta project began in
1984 when a ``middleman'' contacted him about building a chemical
plant to make ``pharmaceuticals and insecticides.''
   He said he found out later that the $136 million project was to
be in Libya and that his participation might violate West German
law.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen also admitted not paying taxes on $11.7
million on profits from his transactions.
   Allegations that several Western companies helped build the
Rabta plant have triggered worldwide debate about toughening
international export law enforcement.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen is the only person to be charged in the
case, though West German authorities are investigating 18 other
people.
   Imhausen-Chemie was found to be the key supplier of equipment,
construction plans and technical expertise to develop the Rabta
project. Prosecutor Hans-Heiko Klein said Hippenstiel-Imhausen had
delivered plans and documents, as well as providing material valued
at $12 million.
   The defendant was arrested in May 1989 and kept in investigative
custody since. His time in custody counts toward his sentence.
   On Tuesday, the ARD television network said Libya intended to
build a second plant using the plans furnished by
Hippenstiel-Imhausen for the first plant. It cited U.S. and West
German intelligence sources for the information.
   The television report said two West German companies and a
Netherlands firm were suspected of having ties to the project.
According to the report, the Stuttgart prosecutor's office is
investigating the allegations against the companies in West Germany.
   The Libyan scandal first came to light in December 1988, when
the United States charged that West German firms were providing
massive assistance for construction of a chemical factory capable
of producing poison gas.
   West German government officials at first denied any of the
country's companies were involved but later acknowledged the
allegations were true.

<HEAD>Broadway Approves Plan to Cut Costs and Ticket Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadway theater owners, unions and producers
have announced a plan to set aside three theaters where patrons
would pay no more than $24 for tickets _ nearly half price.
   The plan announced Tuesday is aimed at stimulating the
development of more productions and drawing theatergoers who can't
afford Broadway anymore. Seats at most non-musicals cost $25 to $45.
   Under the plan, the three major Broadway theater owners _ the
Shubert and Nederlander Organizations and Jujamcyn Theaters _ will
each set aside one of its theaters for the productions, including
dramas and comedies, but not musicals.
   The productions will be booked on a rotating basis, and the
theater owner has the right to reject a play as well as to book a
regular attraction and drop out of the rotation.
   Ticket prices will be reduced by cutting royalties, salaries and
other costs by at least 25 percent. While orchestra seats will cost
$24, seats in the balcony will be as low as $10, a price not seen
on Broadway for years.
   The plan goes into effect Sept. 1 for an 18-month test period.
   The League of American Theaters and Producers said it will
contribute $250,000 for administrative expenses and lighting in the
three theaters.

<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somewhere during a 37-year career,
most people would take a vacation. Or maybe even use a sick day.
   Not Richard Lamica.
   ``There was a job to be done,'' he said. ``I didn't need
vacation. Besides, the post office has been good to me all my
life.''
   After logging 76,960 hours at the U.S. Postal Service's Mountain
View office, Lamica retired last week, leaving behind $104,000
worth of unused vacation time.
   He won't get the vacation money because he chose not to draw the
pay over the years.
   ``He is an exceptionally nice fella,'' Postmaster Ken Baker said.
   Lamica, 55, began work at age 17, and except for a few days off
in the 1960s to take the kids to Disneyland, he hasn't taken
vacation.
   By the time he retired Friday, he had also racked up 410 sick
days.
   Lamica was honored by city officials in April when he was
selected grand marshal of the spring parade.
   On Monday, his first day as a retiree, Lamica said he wasn't
sure what to do with himself.
   ``It feels strange,'' he said. ``It feels like I should be at
work. This isn't going to be too easy.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Party officials said today that the
Central Committee will meet Friday to consider postponing next
week's party congress, a policy-setting gathering of 4,700
delegates from across the country.
   Reformers fear that conservative foes of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's could dominate the gathering, split the party and
undermine the Soviet leader as he tries to pull his country out of
a deep economic and political crisis.
   The congress, scheduled months ago, is to begin Monday. But
reports suddenly surfaced this week that it might be put off
because of concerns that hard-liners may prevail.
   The reform-minded president of the Russian republic, Boris N.
Yeltsin, told a news conference Tuesday that he favored postponing
the congress until autumn to ``stabilize the political situation.''
   A party official who spoke on condition of anonymity said today
that party's 249-member policy-making Central Committee would meet
on Friday.
   Yeltsin predicted there would be ``a real struggle'' at the
Central Committee plenum over the congress timing.
   A postponement could prevent party hard-liners from capitalizing
on their successes last week at a meeting of party members from the
Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic.
   The 2,700 party members at the Russian Federation meeting will
constitute a majority of delegates to the national congress.
   Party congresses are normally held every five years. Delegates
have the right to elect the party leadership and change the party's
rules and program, though in the past power has always flowed from
the top.
   Until Gorbachev came to power, the party was the country's
leading political force. Now, Gorbachev has stripped it of its
political monopoly as he seeks to transfer power to a more
democratic government.
   The Communists have been blamed for the sorry state of the
economy and have suffered major defeats at the polls.
   Gorbachev heads both the party as general secretary and the
government as president, a post whose powers he has expanded, so he
could lose the party post and still be Soviet leader.
   Despite the uncertainty surrounding the congress, the Central
Committee went ahead today and published a ``program statement''
that the congress will discuss and be asked to approve.
   The program, spread across almost two pages of the Communist
Party daily Pravda, takes a repentant tone about the party's blame
for the country's ills.
   But it maintains that the country's main problem lay in the past
distortion of socialism, not the ideology itself.
   ``False ideas about socialism as a society based on the state
monopoly on property, and dictatorship led by the party-state brass
in the name of the proletariat, led to tyranny and lawlessness and
the alienation of people from property and authority,'' the
committee said.
   The program backs many of Gorbachev's reforms already under way,
including the transition to a market economy and the party's
rejection of its former political monopoly.
   It also proposes more independence for party organizations in
the 15 Soviet republics, and allows for the possibility of various
platforms in the party without actually approving full-fledged
factions.
   On the issue of whether party units should be removed from the
KGB and army, the program says the party groups should be allowed
to remain but be clearly separate from the basic power structure.
   The Russian Federation's parliament gave preliminary approval
this month to a decree that would ban the party units in the KGB
and army. It also forbade officials to combine a high party and
government post.
   Yeltsin said Tuesday that the national party congress was the
``last chance for radical renewal of the party,'' and that he would
suspend his party membership if he is dissatisfied with the results.
   The public debate over whether to postpone the congress
contrasted sharply with carefully orchestrated meetings in the past.
   Along with the new program, Gorbachev is trying to bring new
party rules to this congress. According to an early draft, they
would slim down the Central Committee and expand the ruling
Politburo, which has generally included about a dozen members and
done all the party's most important decision-making.
   It would also be renamed the Presidium.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Arkady A. Maslennikov, asked Tuesday by
reporters about Gorbachev's position on the congress' timing,
declined to comment and said the Central Committee would decide
when the congress would be held.

<HEAD>Sirhan Denied Parole For 13th Time</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SOLEDAD, Calif. _ A state parole board refused to release from
prison Sirhan B. Sirhan, convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy in
1968.
   Sirhan, 46, was told after a five-hour hearing at Soledad prison
on Tuesday that he will not be eligible again for parole until 1992.
   Parole was denied ``because the prisoner committed a political
assassination, which is unique in American history,'' said David
Brown, one of three members of the Board of Prison Terms who
presided over the hearing.
   Kennedy had just won California's Democratic presidential
primary when Sirhan shot him in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968.
Sirhan, a Jerusalem-born Christian Arab, later said he was angry at
Kennedy for supporting the shipment of jets to Israel.
   Sirhan's death sentence was reduced to life in prison with the
possibility of parole after the state death penalty was overturned.
His first parole hearing was in 1975; Tuesday marked the 13th time
parole has been denied.

   Bands played German waltzes and marches
to honor Lawrence Welk, king of champagne music, as work began on
the restoration of his farm where he learned to play the accordian
as a child.
   Gov. George Sinner was among 100 people at the groundbreaking
ceremonies Tuesday. He said Welk symbolizes the talent of the
descendants of Germans who came to North Dakota 100 years ago.
   ``They are people who believe that artistic ability is at its
best when it is for the common people,'' the governor said.
   Welk knew early on he wanted to be a musician and not a farmer,
said Rosemary Schaefbauer, president of Welk Heritage Inc., which
is coordinating the restoration of the home where Welk lived until
he was 21.
   ``He disliked milking the cows, so he made it interesting by
trying to do it in rhythm,'' she said. ``But the cows didn't like
it. They would kick over the milk pail or slap him with their
tails.''
   Young Welk made a deal with his father. Lawrence would work on
the farm until he was 21 if his father would buy him a $400
accordion. The deal complete, he struck out on his own in 1924.
   Welk formed a band three years later and got his start in radio
at WNAX in Yankton, S.D. The band was known as ``The Honolulu Fruit
Gum Orchestra'' and ``Lawrence Welk and his Hotsy Totsy Boys,'' and
played at area ballrooms for several years in the late 1920s and
early 1930s.
   In the late 1930s, the band traveled east to the William Penn
Hotel in Pittsburgh, where ``Champagne Music'' was born. Welk
played in the Chicago area in the 1940s, and became a national
television star in the late 1950s.
   His syndicated television show, still in reruns, is a favorite
among North Dakotans on Saturday nights.
   The bandleader, now 87 and living in Los Angeles, did not attend
the groundbreaking. But he sent a note of thanks.
   ``Little did I dream when I was growing up on the farm so many,
many years ago that someday it would be restored and people would
come and marvel at how life was lived in the early 1920s,'' Welk
wrote.
   Welk's parents, Ludwig and Christina, arrived in North Dakota in
1893.
   The Welk farm in this town of 600 about 75 miles south of
Bismarck had been vacant since 1966.
   The cost of the restoration project is estimated at $750,000,
including $500,000 for a trust to maintain the museum after it
opens.
   Welk Heritage Inc. has raised $150,000, including $80,000 from
Welk's foundation in California. It hopes to collect the rest from
grants and donations.
   Carpenters have finished rebuilding a granary and a buggy house,
a summer kitchen and the outhouse on the farm. Renovation work is
under way on the 25-by 28-foot sod house built by Welk's father at
the turn of the century.

   Nelson Mandela went window-shopping today,
strolling past storefronts on busy Connecticut Avenue to the
surprise of early-morning commuters.
   Only hours before his scheduled departure for Atlanta, Mandela
left his hotel at 6:15 a.m. for a walk that took him from downtown
to the city's DuPont Circle neighborhood. Along the way he stopped
to look in store windows, and seemed surprised to find books with
his photo on the cover in a bookstore window.
   Mandela arrived in lobby of his hotel in a New York Yankees
warmup jacket and cap. He was greeted by Metropolitan Police
officers who gave him a blue police T-shirt and a Washington
Redskins cap. He changed into the new outfit in the lobby before
starting his walk.
   Mandela also took a morning walk on Tuesday.
   Shortly before 7 a.m., he took a 25-minute hike, watched only by
a handful of security officers, a couple of photographers, and a
few surprised commuters who chanced across his path.
   His security detail raced to keep up with the smiling
71-year-old African leader, who wore the New York Yankees cap and
jacket he had been given earlier at the New York stadium. Officers
barked at each other and rushed at pedestrians _ including one man
walking his dog _ to make hasty security checks.
   One city police officer paused long enough, however, to play
tourist, taking out a small camera and snapping Mandela's picture.

<HEAD>Thatcher Pledges $9 Million to Global Environmental Fund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today urged an
international conference to reduce the use of chemicals depleting
the ozone layer, and she pledged $9 million to the world's first
global environmental fund.
   ``We need to speed up action and set ourselves higher targets
and shorter deadlines for reducing and eventually eliminating CFCs
and halons,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the government ministers and
officials from nearly 100 countries.
   ``Even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer were
banned tomorrow, ozone depletion would continue to get worse for
more than a decade. It would still take our planet well beyond the
lifetime of all of us here to replenish the ozone already lost.
   ``That is the extent of the damage we have already done.''
   CFCs, used in aerosol sprays, refrigerators, foams and cleaning
solvents, destroy ozone gas scattered through the stratosphere
about 30 to 50 miles above the Earth's surface. Scientists say that
without the gas that filters out harmful ultraviolet rays, life in
Earth would cease.
   Higher ultraviolet radiation damages the human immune system,
causes skin cancer and cataracts, harms crops and disrupts sea life.
   Dr. Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the U.N. Environment
Program, told delegates: ``Far too much is at stake to contemplate
failure. We have no option but to succeed and inshallah (God
willing) we will succeed.''
   Tolba said the London meeting was ``establishing a new political
movement to deal with the environmental crisis... a movement rooted
in respect for the value of human life, the value of nature. We are
not just writing a new treaty; we are writing a new chapter in
international relations.''
   During the three-day meeting, the officials will study proposals
calling for a worldwide ban on a group of chemicals that threaten
the planet's ozone shield. The conference also will discuss a
proposal to create an international fund to help poorer countries
pay the high price for ozone-friendly technology.
   Conference sources said diplomats were close to agreement on
such a fund, which the United States opposed until two weeks ago.
   In a week of working sessions before the meeting moved to
ministerial level, delegates tried to hammer out details for the
fund proposal.
   But a number of tricky issues remain to be resolved by the
ministers, including where the funds will come from.
   Many developing countries insist that the richer industrialized
nations help the Third World pay the bill, estimated at $2 to $7
billion in the coming years, for converting to substitutes for
chloroflurocarbons, or CFCs.
   Developed nations, led by the United States, want to shift their
contributions from aid funds already allocated.
   The ministers appear likely to agree on a three-year down
payment of $160 million, as suggested by Tolba.
   Another $80 million would be promised to China and India, to
coax them into signing the 1987 Montreal Protocol on protecting the
ozone layer.
   The ministers' work, if successful, will extend and strengthen
the Montreal Protocol, already considered an environmental
watershed.
   In September 1987, 56 nations agreed to halve CFC by 1996.
   Since then, scientific evidence on the destruction caused by the
chemicals has prompted countries to move more quickly to eliminate
them completely. Eighty-one nations decided in principle last year
to ban them by the year 2000.
   Ministers will be debating whether to quicken the pace. The
12-nation European Community, along with the Nordic countries,
Australia and New Zealand, wants to move up the ban to 1997. The
United States and Japan are opposed.
   The ministers are likely to agree to ban halons and carbon
tetrachloride, in addition to CFCs, by the year 2000. Both are used
in firefighting.
   Scientific studies overwhelmingly show the ozone layer will not
be fully restored unless all the severely damaging chemicals are
banned worldwide and some of the less harmful substitutes are
strictly controlled.

   The American Medical Association's legislative
body pledged to scrutinize the organization's finances because of
questionable use by one former officer of hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   The AMA's 436-member House of Delegates voted Tuesday to require
that members be told how much officials receive as pay and as other
compensation.
   ``The board understands full well that the extraordinary
financial transactions and their consequences have resulted in pain
and embarrassment,'' said John J. Ring, of Mundelein, Ill.,
chairman of the board of trustees.
   ``For that, for our lack of knowledge at a time when we should
have known, the board of trustees expresses its sincere regret to
this House of Delegates,'' Ring said.
   The house rejected an effort to require reporting of all
consulting contracts to AMA members.
   That proposal was submitted by the Louisiana delegation, which
argued that the AMA officials need such oversight if their members'
confidence is to be restored.
   But the AMA's newly appointed executive vice president, James S.
Todd, said publishing the details of consulting contracts would put
the association at a competitive disadvantage in attracting talent
at reasonable prices, and inhibit the development of organization
policies.
   The Board of Trustes submitted a report to the delegates
outlining findings that James H. Sammons, the AMA's former
executive vice president:
   _ Authorized the reimbursement from AMA funds of $353,826 for
losses suffered by his money market account during the October 1987
stock market crash without disclosing the transaction to the board.
   _ Approved a loan of $267,710 for a condominium for the AMA
general counsel, which ultimately the AMA foreclosed on at a loss
of $76,672.
   _ Sold the AMA his home for $280,000, although the AMA ``was in
possession of a single appraisal indicating that the value of the
property was from $265,000 to $272,000.''
   Sammons retired in February.

<HEAD>Index of Leading Indicators Up in May</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS 11th graf, The various..., to make index up 1.4
percent from its level a year ago sted 1.1 percent.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge rose 0.8 percent in May, another indication the economy will
skirt a recession this year, the government reported today.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months in advance. If the economy
continues to grow through November, it will reach its eighth year
of expansion. It already is the longest expansion in peacetime
history.
   But today's Commerce Department report also contained an ominous
note _ the largest negative contributor among the 11
forward-looking indicators was an index measuring consumer
confidence.
   It was further evidence that Americans are becoming more
cautious in their spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity and which has helped fuel economic
growth for 7{ years.
   But as consumer spending appears to pause, analysts point to
business investment and overseas demand for U.S. goods as a major
stimulus for continued, although weak, growth.
   The leading indicators were released as White House and
congressional leaders were preparing to resume negotiations on a
plan to reduce the fiscal 1991 deficit _ a reduction that would
require continued economic growth.
   A recession would make that task much more difficult since it
would mean a loss of jobs and incomes, diminished corporate profits
and a drop in tax revenues. At the same time, the government would
be called upon to increase spending on various benefits.
   In advance of today's report, a consensus of economists had
expected the index to have risen 0.7 percent.
   Seven of the components were positive in May _ a longer average
workweek, an increase in the price of raw materials, a larger
amount of orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices, a
decrease in the weekly unemployment claims, slower business
delivery times and an increase in orders for new plants and
equipment.
   In addition to the drop in consumer confidence, the other
negatives were a decrease in the money supply, a smaller number of
building permits and a drop in manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   The various changes left the index at 146.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year ago.
   Many economists, who believe the nation's economy will continue
to expand sluggishly during the remainder of the year, are growing
more anxious over the slowing contributions of American consumers.
   The consumer confidence index was negative in January and
February and unchanged in March. It posted a slim gain in April.
   Analysts have cited a poor job market and weak wage gains for
the flagging consumer confidence.
   ``Consumer spending will remain weak,'' economists for Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets wrote in their current Weekly Economic &amp;
Financial Commentary.
   ``Spending on services should rise solidly in the second quarter
after posting a meager gain in the first quarter, but spending on
goods will probably decline.''
   Indeed, retail sales have fallen for three straight months
through May, the first time that has happened since the summer of
1981 during the last recession. Retail sales represent about half
of consumer spending.
   The Commerce Department also reported last week that overall
consumer spending was flat in May, and said the April and March
gains were weaker than first thought.
   And the Federal Reserve, in a survey completed by its district
banks earlier this month, found ``very little growth, if not a
decline, in real consumer spending for durable and non-durable
goods this quarter from last.''
   Many analysts say the Fed's tight-money policy designed to curb
inflation has contributed to the economic slowdown by boosting
interest rates. Some are calling for further relaxation of the
Fed's grip on credit before the economy slips into a recession.
   A June survey of 51 prominent economists by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators in Sedona, Ariz., produced a consensus forecast of a
weak 1.9 percent growth in the gross national product _ the
nation's total output of goods and services. The GNP rose 3 percent
last year and 4.4 percent in 1988.
   But while consumers may be pulling back, recent reports indicate
that the manufacturing sector may have bottomed out. Big-ticket
durable goods orders, for instance, were up 3.9 percent in May,
while industrial production posted a 0.6 percent increase.
   Nevertheless, the automobile and housing industries continue to
be a drag on the economy, leaving exports one of the few bright
spots.
   ``Because of weak domestic demand,'' the Merrill Lynch
economists said, ``exports are likely to be the main source of
growth in the second quarter and for the rest of the year.''
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department also said the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators had slipped a revised 0.1 percent in
April after a 1.0 percent gain in March. But even though the index
fell in April, the revision was a slight improvement over the 0.2
percent decline originally reported last month.

   A 27-year-old man was charged today with
decapitating his adoptive parents with a saw, police said.
   The bodies of Anthony and Ann Camerlengo, both 73, were
discovered Tuesday night in the basement of their home. The man's
legs also were cut off. The couple's heads were found in a storm
drain down the street early today.
   Thomas Camerlengo was charged with murder and weapons
possession, police said.
   The couple's nephew, who lives next door, had notified police
after going to the home to look for some belongings, said Sgt. Tina
Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman.
   The handle of a bow saw was found near the bodies, and a bloody
blade was in the bathroom upstairs, Mohrmann said.
   Police gave no motive for the slayings.
   Thomas Varughese, a neighbor of the couple, said Camerlengo had
a history of mental illness and had returned two or three weeks ago
from a psychiatric hospital. Mohrmann said she could not confirm
the report.

<TEXT>
   President Yang Shangkun, a key power-broker among
China's conservative leaders, has been hospitalized with
appendicitis, the Foreign Ministry said today.
   The ministry, in a short statement, said 83-year-old Yang
entered a hospital Monday with appendicitis and underwent an
operation. It did not say where Yang was hospitalized or what his
condition was.
   The official Xinhua News Agency characterized Yang's illness as
``acute appendicitis.''
   Premier Li Peng, in a meeting today with Chad's president, Hadj
Hissein Habre, described the operation as ``minor'' and said Yang
was ``very well and recovering,'' Xinhua reported. Li said the
operation was a success and that he had visited Yang in the
hospital on Tuesday.
   The post of presidency in China is largely ceremonial. Yang,
however, is also a member of the party's policy-making Politburo
and is vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission.
   Questions about Yang's health were raised after he failed to
appear Tuesday to accept a medal given him by the Peruvian
government. A welcoming ceremony for President Hissene Habre of
Chad scheduled for Tuesday afternoon that Yang was to have presided
over was postponed.
   Vice President Wang Zhen attended the welcoming ceremony in
Yang's place today.
   Yang, a retired People's Liberation Army general, swept into
prominence last year when he and Premier Li Peng ordered the
imposition of martial law in Beijing to end pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   He is widely regarded as representing the hard-line stance
toward the student-led demonstrations that led to the June 1989
bloody military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Since then, he has elevated supporters such as his brother Yang
Baibing into key posts in the military and the government, and has
been regarded by China watchers as putting himself in line to
succeed 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping as China's senior leader.
   Deng and Yang are longtime allies, and Yang has supported Deng's
economic reforms but is thought to be more politically conservative.

   Nelson Mandela departed the capital today
assured of some political support and buoyed by a tumultuous rally
where he was serenaded, praised and nearly worshipped by more than
19,000 Washingtonians.
   Mandela left for Atlanta at midmorning, concluding a three-day
visit during which he won assurances from President Bush and
members of Congress of continuing U.S. economic sanctions against
South Africa's white government.
   The African National Congress leader, accompanied by his wife,
Winnie, shook hands with the police officers and posed for photos
before boarding a charter flight for the next leg of his U.S. visit.
   Mandela made no statement, but on Tuesday night he told a
cheering crowd, ``We thank you, America. We thank you for being
true to your responsibility ... We thank you for responding to our
cause.''
   The 71-year-old Mandela also called Tuesday for financial
assistance to his country once the apartheid system of racial
segregation is abolished.
   ``We need to mobilize the country for peace,'' Mandela told
supporters. ``We need to train personnel for economic recovery. ...
For all this we shall continue to rely on your firm support.''
   The rally in the city's convention center was jammed with
spectators, some of whom paid $1,000 to attend a reception before
the event.
   When Mandela entered the stage filled with people including
Jesse Jackson and embattled Mayor Marion Barry and his wife, Effi,
the crowd jumped from their seats, screaming and cheering. Mandela
briefly joined a group of South African dancers, and smiled and
waved to the crowd.
   ``Sisters and brothers, as we enter the third leg of our visit
to the United States, our delegation, my wife and I feel more
assured of our overwhelming support,'' he said.
   ``Apartheid must go, and it must go now. The masses of the
American people are with us. Both Congress (the House) and the
Senate of the United States are with us. President Bush and the
administration are with us. Surely apartheid will go,'' he said.
   Bush, in meeting with Mandela on Monday, assured him that he is
not about to lift U.S. economic sanctions.
   But the president and many in Congress made it clear they were
not happy with Mandela's continuing refusal to renounce violence in
the struggle against apartheid. Some in Congress also criticized
his support for radical leaders such as Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and
Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   Jackson, in introducing Mandela at the rally, apologized for
U.S. complicity in his arrest by the South African government 27
years ago.
   ``Our CIA was a factor in your arrest,'' Jackson said. ``We are
ashamed of that,'' he added, as the crowd again erupted into
applause and cheers.
   Earlier Tuesday, in an address to a joint meeting of Congress,
Mandela made an impassioned plea for justice, comparing the
struggle of South African blacks to that of America's founding
fathers.
   ``Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues to
bleed and suffocate, needs democracy,'' he said.
   The one-time prisoner was accorded the kind of reception from
Congress normally reserved for U.S. presidents. His entrance was
greeted with a 2{-minute ovation and there was even longer applause
from the packed House chamber when he finished.
   In an interview published in today's editions of The Washington
Post, Mandela said the ANC would agree to the lifting of U.S.
economic sanctions once ``mutual confidence'' is achieved between
the Pretoria government and the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``And it may not be necessary for us actually to agree upon a
constitution before we can feel that fundamental and irreversible
change has taken place,'' he said.
   ``It's a question that must depend on the progress that we're
making, and on how we address the problems that arise, and how
mutual confidence is built in the course of our negotiations.''

   Charges of reckless homicide and criminal
violations of federal safety law have been filed in a 1988 tunnel
explosion that killed three workers.
   U.S. Attorney John E. Fryatt said the S.A. Healy Co. of McCook,
Ill., and project manager Patrick Doig were named in a 12-count
indictment charging them with violations of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970.
   In addition to the federal grand jury indictment, Milwaukee
County District Attorney E. Michael McCann announced that state
charges of reckless homicide were filed against S.A. Healy in two
of the deaths.
   The three men died in a methane explosion Nov. 10, 1988, in a
tunnel that is part of a Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage
Commission's $2 billion improvement project.
   Fryatt said the charges involved failures in providing and
maintaining a sufficient ventilation system and proper electrical
equipment, in safety instruction of employees, and in de-energizing
electrical power in the area where high levels of methane gas were
detected.
   Killed in the explosion were Ronald Kohne, 49, of Big Sandy,
Tenn., the superintendent; Rick Sochacki, 34, South Holland, Ill.,
a safety officer; and Tony Bell, 25, of Sturgeon Bay, a shift
foreman.
   McCann, who headed a coroner's inquest into the deaths in
December, said the reckless homicide charges were filed in the
deaths of Sochacki and Bell. He said each charge carries a maximum
$10,000 fine.
   Inquest testimony indicated that the day the blast occurred, the
tunnel had been cleared of workers because of high methane levels,
and the victims were returning to check the tunnel when the gas
exploded.
   Attorney David Cannon, representing S.A. Healy, said the company
and Doig expect to be vindicated.
   ``The company doesn't believe that any of its employees
committed any reckless acts in the tragedy and as a result expects
to vigorously contest all the charges,'' Cannon said.
   Each misdemeanor count in the federal indictment carries a
maximum penalty of six months in jail and fine of $250,000 for an
individual and $500,000 for a company.
   Fryatt said S.A. Healy could face total fines of $6 million and
Doig could face three years in prison and fines totaling $1.5
million, if convicted.

<HEAD>Panel Moves to Bar Legal Aid Lawyers From Eviction Cases</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: RECASTS first 2 grafs; picks up 3rd graf, The resolution...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days after legal aid lawyers won a court
fight to restrict a Bush administration drug-fighting effort, a
presidential panel sought to bar anti-poverty attorneys from taking
such cases.
   Directors of the Legal Services Corp. asked Congress in a
resolution approved Monday to enact legislation that would bar
legal aid groups receiving federal money from representing
suspected drug dealers in public-housing eviction cases.
   The resolution, approved by voice vote, also urged local legal
aid organizations to discourage their attorneys from filing such
cases.
   Last Friday, legal-aid lawyers in Richmond, Va., won a court
order that restricted public-housing raids planned by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to evict suspected drug
dealers by seizing their leases.
   The order generally barred eviction of public-housing tenants
suspected of dealing drugs unless they were given prior notice and
a hearing.
   Instead, federal marshals on Monday began serving notices
informing tenants that their public-housing leases were seized and
they would eventually be kicked out. The seizures are authorized by
a forfeiture provision of the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act.
   By late Tuesday, 25 public-housing leases had been seized in
Washington, Chicago, Richmond, New York City, Macon, Ga.; New
Haven, Conn.; and Columbus, Ohio, the Justice Department said. HUD
said it planned to serve seizure notices in 19 cities this week.
   Legal Services Corp. spokesman David Eisner said the resolution
was not adopted as a specific response to the case brought in
Richmond by the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society.
   But Eisner said ``legal services attorneys like those lawyers in
the Richmond case are standing in the way of the policy of getting
drug dealers out of public housing.''
   Board members have been concerned for some time that ``legal
services attorneys take simple eviction proceedings and make them
drag out for six months or a year,'' Eisner said.
   At Monday's board meeting, Henry McLaughlin, the executive
director of the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society that obtained
last week's court order, argued against adoption of the resolution.
   McLaughlin told board members that seeking due process for
public-housing tenants facing eviction was a proper use of federal
money. The Richmond organization received $562,652 from the Legal
Services Corp., this fiscal year, Eisner said.
   The resolution had the support of HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who
announced plans for the anti-drug raids last month.
   ``Kemp's initiative to get the scourge of drugs out of public
housing is one of the most important things that we can do,''
Eisner said.
   Carolyn Stewart, a spokeswoman for the National Legal Aid and
Defenders Association, said the board would prohibit innocent
relatives of suspected drug dealers the right to challenge their
evictions.
   ``What this implies is guilt by association and trial by
family,'' she said. ``If a family member is involved in any sort of
drug activity, this action by the board would punish all members of
that family by denying them representation under the law.''
   Civil libertarians argue that eviction without prior notice and
a hearing violates the Constitution.

<TEXT>
   French and Iranian relief teams rescued at
least seven people, including a mother and her 12-year-old son, who
were buried for five days in the rubble from the earthquake in
Iran, the official media said today.
   In another development, field tribunals were being set up in
Rudbar and Manjil to try ``criminals who are abusing the
situation'' in the ravaged northwestern area, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported. IRNA appeared to be referring either to
looters or profiteers operating after Thursday's quake.
   The agency also said at least 50 aftershocks were recorded
Tuesday night and today. More than 400 aftershocks have occurred
since the quake struck.
   Officials say between 36,000 and 50,000 people were killed and
200,000 injured in the temblor, which measured 7.3 to 7.7 on the
Richter scale. About a half million people were left homeless. A
Western Red Cross official said Tuesday that the death toll
eventually could reach 70,000.
   The head of Iran's Red Crescent societies, Mohammed Parham, said
175 foreign planes carrying tons of aid had landed in Tehran since
Sunday and that no additional foreign doctors or relief workers
were needed, IRNA reported.
   The rescued mother and the 12-year-old boy were found critically
injured Tuesday in the village of Kelishom, 100 miles northwest of
Tehran, IRNA said. Two other people were rescued in village of
Vieh, IRNA said.
   The agency also said a man, a woman and a boy, members of a
family, were rescued in the village of Jirandeh the same day.
``Rescue workers had to remove massive piles of rubble and dig for
four hours'' to save the family, it said.
   Bulldozers and cranes removed the dusty debris in many of the
342 cities and remote mountain villages affected by the quake, and
relief teams brought tents and food supplies to the homeless.
   Survivors were being housed in more than 70,000 tents sent to
the region, said Parham, whose organization is the Islamic version
of the Red Cross.
   Parham praised the foreign relief effort and said about 500
foreign doctors and relief workers were in the quake-afflicted
area. But he said relief operations were approaching the final
stages and added there was no need to dispatch additional foreign
doctors and relief workers to Iran, IRNA reported.
   Relief workers, meanwhile, are trying to prepare for the next
threats _ a possible outbreak of disease and the fierce winter
winds that roar through the stricken region. Pestilence is a danger
as rains falling on bodies trapped in rubble wash bacteria into the
water supply.
   Kingsley Seevaratnam of the Geneva-based League of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies, said Iranian authorities want to move
people out of the stricken northwestern provinces quickly to avoid
possible epidemics.
   Christian Brauner, a disaster specialist with the West German
Red Cross, said he hoped to persuade West German authorities to
send experts in repairing water and sewage systems to help Iran
provide a clean water supply.
   In Manjil, about 135 miles northwest of Tehran, Brauner said
tents now being given out for temporary housing will be inadequate
when winter comes.
   ``They will be torn to ribbons,'' he said.
   In Parliament, hard-line deputies said Tuesday that the foreign
aid _ much of it from countries Iran considers enemies _ will not
buy closer relations with the West or nullify positions taken by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Those stands include the February 1989
death threat to British author Salman Rushdie for offending some
Moslems with his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' Rushdie has pledged
several thousand dollars to help survivors of the quake.
   One deputy, Ayatollah Saddegh Khalkhali, said quake aid from the
United States, Iraq and Saudi Arabia was appreciated but Iran
``could not forget our martyrs.'' The high-ranking cleric added:
``We cannot forgive the killing of 300 people on the Airbus or the
400 at Mecca.''
   He was referring to the U.S. downing in July 1989 of an Iranian
jetliner that killed all 290 aboard. The Navy said the jetliner,
shot down over the Persian Gulf, was mistaken for a warplane.
   More than 400 Moslem pilgrims, most of them Iranians, died when
Saudi troops opened fire on a demonstration in Mecca in July 1987.

   Government security forces detained
hundreds of Tamil youths in Colombo today in sweeps for guerrillas
believed to have infiltrated the capital.
   The government, meanwhile, said 400,000 people have fled the
2-week-old upsurge in Sri Lanka's civil war and that many were
without food, water or shelter. ``We are starving,'' said one
resident in the town of Batticaloa. ``There is no electricity and
no transport. Only guns, guns and guns.''
   Also today, military officials called on 2,500 Tamil Tiger
rebels believed trapped in an eastern jungle to surrender or risk
an intensive air attack.
   The Tigers are ``on the retreat on all fronts. ... They are a
spent force now,'' said army commander General Hamilton Wanasinghe.
   On Monday and Tuesday, government air force planes bombed and
strafed rebel positions surrounding a strategic 200-year-old fort
in the northern city of Jaffna, the rebel stronghold.
   A rebel statement claimed ``hundreds'' of buildings had been set
on fire by incendiaries and that civilians were killed in the raids.
   At least 1,626 combatants have died since the civil war flared
up anew on June 11. Fighting started after a Tamil man claimed he
was manhandled by Sinhalese police and Tamil Tiger guerrillas
responded by attacking police stations in the east.
   Ethnic Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million
people and control the army and the government. Tamils comprise 18
percent.
   Claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese, Tamil Tigers have
since 1983 been waging war to carve out a separate Tamil homeland
in the north and east.
   Military officials say they believe Tamil Tiger guerrillas are
moving into the south and planning attacks against Sinhalese
civilians as retribution for rebel losses in the north and east.
   In the past, rebel statements have said they kill Sinhalese
civilians because government troops kill Tamil civilians.
   Police and troops today cordoned off Kochchikade town, about a
half mile north of Colombo's city center, and went into homes,
shops and businesses questioning young Tamils.
   Residents contacted by telephone said security forces prevented
people from leaving or entering the town for more than six hours. A
large number of young Tamils who were new to the area were taken
away in police vehicles, residents said.
   Similar operations, according to military and police officials,
were being conducted throughout the south, with hundreds of Tamil
youths taken into custody.
   The worst rebel attack on civilians occurred on May 14, 1985
when a marauding gang of Tamil rebels launched a machine-gun and
grenade attack on Sinhalese Buddhists worshiping at a shrine in
Anuradhapura, an ancient capital, about 100 miles north of Colombo.
In all, 157 people were kiled.
   Military officials say the fighting in the east has Tamil rebels
on the run. On Tuesday, air force helicopters dropped thousands of
leaflets over a dense jungle asking rebels to surrender.
   The leaflets were dropped near Kundikudicharu village in the
eastern Batticaloa district, where military officials believe 2,500
rebels were trapped.
   Rebels were asked to leave their weapons behind and come out of
the jungle. The leaflets said the rebels would not be harmed.

<TEXT>
   Japan has long been pressing Washington to raise
taxes to cut the U.S. federal deficit, and a senior Tokyo official
today said that may have helped get President Bush to agree to the
idea of tax increases.
   Misoji Sakamoto, chief Cabinet secretary, said Japanese
officials strongly supported U.S. measures to cut the budget
deficit in talks with U.S. negotiators in Tokyo this week.
   The Tokyo talks are aimed at reducing Japan's $49 billion trade
surplus with the United States by making structural changes in both
nations' economies.
   The talks went into an extra day today but remained at an
impasse, said a senior Bush administration official participating
in the negotiations. The official, who requested anonymity, urged
Tokyo to match Bush by making a stronger commitment to ending the
trade imbalance between the two countries.
   Bush, in a written statement released Tuesday in Washington, did
not say whether he was considering an actual tax increase or higher
revenues from the current system.
   But his willingness to include the word ``tax'' was the
strongest indication to date that he might be willing to accept tax
increases as part of an effort to lower the deficit.
   An official from the prime minister's office quoted Sakamoto as
saying Bush ``may have paid consideration'' to Japanese opinion on
increasing U.S. taxes.
   The U.S. budget deficit is regarded as a spur to U.S.
consumption that increases demand for Japanese imports and thus
contributes to the trade imbalance.
   On Tuesday, Japanese officials at the talks asked U.S.
negotiators why the United States dropped a target year of 1993 for
eliminating the deficit, estimated at $200 billion in the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
   U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said later
Tuesday they told the Japanese that Washington wants to look beyond
eliminating the budget deficit by 1993 and to envision a budget
surplus.
   In addition to working on lowering the budget deficit, the
United States has agreed to improve worker training and education
and to increase savings, steps designed to increase exports and
lower imports.
   Among other issues, Japan has agreed to increase public works
spending, ease restrictions on opening large retail stores, revise
land-use policies to curb high land prices and crack down on unfair
business practices.
   The measures are thought likely to increase foreign
opportunities for trade and investment in Japan.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's first freely
elected Parliament in 44 years convened its opening session today
and prepared to elect new leaders.
   The legislature is dominated by President Vaclav Havel's Civic
Forum and its Slovak ally which led last year's peaceful revolution
against the Communists.
   The House of Nations and the House of the People, the two
chambers of Parliament, met to elect their respective chairmen and
were then to convene in joint session to elect a new speaker and
the Presidium of Parliament. The Presidium meets between
legislative sessions to decide on technical matters.
   Alexander Dubcek, who was appointed to head the interim
parliament in December after the Communists were ousted, was the
only candidate for Parliament speaker, Civic Forum spokesman Petr
Kucera said. Dubcek represents Public Against Violence, the Civic
Forum's sister movement.
   His deputy was again to be Zdenek Jicinsky, a Civic Forum
member, Kucera said.
   Dubcek, who led the 1968 Prague Spring reforms that were crushed
by Soviet-led troops, regained prominence in the heady days of the
peaceful revolution as a symbol of reform.
   Th interim government was to submit its formal resignation later
today, but incumbent Premier Marian Calfa is to head the new
cabinet. Havel planned to formally announce the new federal
government late today on national television.
   Several ministers appointed to Calfa's interim ``government of
national understanding'' in December were expected to retain their
posts.
   The Civic Forum and Public Against Violence won elections two
weeks ago, gaining 170 seats in the bicameral house. The
Communists, who ruled unchallenged for four decades until the
November revolution, won 47 seats.
   The third strongest group is the Christian Democratic Alliance,
which won 40 seats in the June 8-9 elections, the first free
balloting since 1946.
   The composition of the new federal government was forged at
turbulent coalition talks which ended Friday after the Christian
Democratic Movement reversed an earlier decision and decided to
join Civic Forum in governing.
   The unofficial leader of the Christian Democratic Movement, Jan
Carnogursky, was appointed deputy prime minister in the Slovak
regional government today after rejecting any post on the federal
government. The Slovak government is headed by Public Against
Violence member Vladimir Meciar.
   The Czech regional government, to be put together by the Civic
Forum's Petr Pithart, a former activist, was not expected to be
announced before Friday.
   The Civic Forum and Public Against Violence could have formed a
minority federal government but would have lacked the necessary
three-fifths majority needed to push key constitutional changes
through Parliament.
   Officials from both groups repeatedly said they sought the
broadest possible coalition as Czechoslovakia embarks on a
difficult transition to a market economy. They refused to include
the Communists in the government.

<TEXT>
   Sticking to the fast track toward
unification, West Germany has drawn up a plan to complete its
merger with the East in December. But East Germans are already
feeling the pinch of economic union.
   Five days before the two countries create one economy, East
Germans are being forced to search for food and other necessities.
   ``There's no soap here, no meat,'' said Ines Kroll, a
25-year-old mother of two as she pushed her shopping cart past
depleted shelves in the only store in Blankenburg, a small town
north of Berlin.
   Merchants are shutting stores and clearing shelves to make room
for the expected deluge of Western goods. Groceries have been
canceling their orders with East German suppliers and letting their
stocks run out.
   Experts say many East German companies are keeping their
products off the market until next week, when they can sell them
for West German marks.
   Some merchants say they also want to avoid taking in large
amounts of East German marks in the days before the nearly
worthless currency is replaced by the valuable West German mark.
   In Munich, a huge West German electronics and household
appliance company, Siemens, today announced it will invest $600
million in East Germany and hire up to 30,000 people in the next
several years.
   The announcement represents the biggest single investment
program since East Germany shed its Communist government and began
moving to a free market.
   The East German government on Tuesday announced temporary import
tariffs to protect industries threatened by the switch to
capitalism after 40 years of socialist central planning.
   Amid criticism that the rapid merger was hurting many East
Germans, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that quick
unification was important because of the unstable situation in the
Soviet Union:
   ``We need to go through the door to unification because it can
close shut again,'' he told reporters.
   Germans fear instability in Eastern Europe if Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev should be removed from power in the squeeze
between hard-liners upset with his reforms and progressives who
think he is moving too slowly.
   About 380,000 Soviet troops are still on East German soil and
Moscow has balked at withdrawing them over objections to NATO's
desire that a united Germany be party of the Western military
alliance.
   Suggestions for what a political treaty unifying East and West
would look like were released Tuesday by the West German Interior
Ministry in the form of a ``discussion paper.''
   Under the proposals, East Germany would officially join West
Germany the day after elections for a joint German parliament.
   West and East German politicians have proposed Dec. 9 or Dec. 16
as possible dates for the balloting.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in Bonn,
West Germany on Tuesday that he expected the East German Cabinet to
decide today to begin negotiations on the political treaty. He said
a pact should be ready for debate in both parliaments by early
September.
   Last week, the parliaments of both states ratified the treaty
outlining the monetary, economic and social union that is to take
effect on Sunday.
   On that day, the West German mark officially replaces the East
German mark and 40 years of rigid, socialist economic policy give
way to free-market rules.
   Lines of up to 1,000 people have been snaking down sidewalks in
East Berlin as people converge on banks to fill out paperwork
necessary for converting savings accounts to West German marks.
   Depending on age, accounts up to 6,000 marks ($3,600) can be
converted at the most favorable rate of one West German mark for
each East German mark.
   In an attempt to protect its ailing industries from the first
rush of Western competition, East Germany on Tuesday announced a
series of tariffs on Western goods beginning Sunday.
   An 11 percent tariff is to be imposed through the end of the
year, replaced the following quarter by a 6 percent tariff.
   Food will not be affected, although East Germany's huge farm
collectives are expected to be battered by Western agricultural
producers.
   It was uncertain whether the tariffs would remain if the current
quick pace of unification continues and the nations fully unify in
December.
   Many stores are already stocking West German goods under
agreements made in March that allowed a limited entry of some
products into the country.
   But many staples still were in short supply. Mrs. Kroll said she
could find no detergent and rejected the skimpy selection of meat.
She also had mixed feelings about the end of the East German mark.
   ``My husband mints East German coins for a living,'' she said.
   Some experts say 1 million to 4 million workers will lose their
jobs in the first two years of economic unification.
   Many of the heavy industries that were once the backbone of the
former, centrally planned economy are expected to fail as they face
leaner, more efficient Western concerns.

<HEAD>Poindexter Appears Before Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter appeared today before a federal grand jury that was
recently empaneled to continue investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter, who was sentenced June 11 to six months in prison
for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair and obstructing
inquiries of congressional committees, testified behind closed
doors at the U.S. Courthouse.
   A prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh accompanied Poindexter into the grand jury room.
   The grand jury, which has already heard testimony from former
National Security Council aide Oliver L. North, is continuing to
sift evidence about whether other Reagan administration officials
participated in efforts to mislead Congress about the Iran-Contra
affair, according to sources.
   The grand jury is expected to try to perform a final assessment
of the degree of knowledge that President Reagan and then-Vice
President George Bush had of the covert military assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels that was orchestrated by Poindexter and North.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was ordered to
perform 1500 hours of community service, has testified on three
occasions since the grand jury was empaneled last month.
   North worked closely with former State Department official
Elliott Abrams and former CIA officer Alan Fiers in connection with
the Contras. North also had frequent contact with Donald Gregg,
then Bush's aide on national security. matters. Gregg, a former CIA
station chief, is now the U.S. ambassador to South Korea.
   The grand jury is trying to determine whether these officials
participated in efforts to cover up the Iran-Contra affair from
Congress, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Poindexter's convictions are in connection with the coverup of
North's secret Contra resupply network and the concealment of the
U.S. role in a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Reagan approved letters that Poindexter sent to Congress denying
that North was assisting the Contras militarily, Poindexter's
lawyers said before his trial. In a videotaped deposition, however,
Reagan said he didn't recall the letters. Poindexter didn't testify
at his trial, so was unavailable for questioning about his daily
meetings with Reagan.
   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who is free pending
appeal of his case, was convicted of hiding North's role from
Congress and of concealing the fact that Reagan administration
officials knew that a CIA-assisted shipment from Israel to Iran
contained Hawk missiles.
   Reagan testified that he didn't recall when he learned of the
Hawks shipment.

   Nelson Mandela's scheduled arrival in Miami tonight
has driven another wedge between blacks and Cuban-Americans in this
racially divided city.
   The South African anti-apartheid leader has been greeted as a
hero in New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C. But South Florida
politicians have refused to honor him, and area Cuban-Americans are
calling for mass protests during his address Thursdayvention in Miami Beach.
   Black leaders, in turn, are calling for counterdemonstrations
and have condemned t at a labor
conhe politicians for ignoring the message of hope
Mandela could bring to U.S. blacks.
   ``To reject Mandela is to reject us and that is very deep. It's
psychologically devastating,'' said Johnnie McMillian, head of the
Miami-Dade chapter of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   Mandela's visit was welcomed until last week, when he defended
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, Palestine Liberation Organization leader
Yasser Arafat, and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for their help in
the early years of the African National Congress' struggle against
South Africa's racial separation laws.
   The heavily Cuban city of Miami immediately withdrew a planned
proclamation in Mandela's honor.
   Miami Ms of rioting.
   In Los Angeles, county supervisors also clashed over Mandela's
support for Castro, Arafat and Gadhafi, but they still declared
Friday to be Nelson Mandela Day.
   Supervisor Mike Antonovich argued against honoring Mandela, who
is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Friday on the last leg of
his U.S. speaking tour. He called for Mandela to renounce his
support for Arafat, Gadhafi and Fidel Castro.
   ``Because Arafat and Gadhafi have been responsible for so much
bloodshed in the Middle East and all three have contributed to
terrorism, I think we should ask that Mandela repudiate his support
for them,'' Antonovich said Tuesday.
   But Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said Mandela had made it clear he
supported Arafat, Castro and Gadhafi because of their opposition to
the South African government's policy of apartheid, or racial
segregation.

<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The courts could be the next stop for the
issue of equality in funding for Oklahoma schools, now that voters
have defeated a share-the-wealth referendum at a special election.
   Voters split sharply by region as they defeated the proposal
Tuesday.
   The plan was clobbered in Oklahoma City, the largest
municipality, and in most rural areas, especially in western
Oklahoma, where oil reserves and utility plants are concentrated.
   But it won by a hefty margin in Tulsa, in northeastern Oklahoma,
the state's second largest city.
   Andrew Tevington, Gov. Henry Bellmon's chief of staff, said he
understood one group was planning a federal lawsuit challenging the
disparity in district funding, which ranges from $10,600 to $2,300
in per pupil spending.
   ``Unfortunately we'll probably end up in federal court and the
federal courts will write our funding laws instead of the people of
Oklahoma,'' Tevington said.
   Similiar lawsuits have been successful in such states as
Kentucky and Texas.
   Bellmon blamed voter confusion for the defeat of the proposal
and three less controversial issues. The proposals had the support
of Bellmon, a Republican, and leaders of the Democratic majority in
the Legislature.
   The other three questions would have changed how state school
land money is handled, removed antiquated language from the state
Constitution on school attendance and changed the membership of the
state school board.
   The share-the-wealth plan would have redistributed on a
statewide basis oil and property tax revenue that now goes to local
schools.
   It would have put into a single pot property taxes collected on
utility, railroad and airline property valued at more than
$500,000, locally assessed real and personal commercial-industrial
property valued in excess of $500,000, gross production revenue on
oil, the rural electric cooperative corporation tax and motor

   Investigators questioned two armored-car
guards and gave them lie-detector tests after gunmen knocked off
their truck for $10.8 million, the biggest such heist in U.S.
history, officials said.
   The armored car was robbed by at least two men with a shotgun
Tuesday after its crew stopped at a convenience store for a coffee
break, investigators said.
   The guards were forced to drive to a wooded area a half-mile
away, where they were tied up, blindfolded and gagged, officials
said. The robbers put the cash, in bags weighing at least 1,500
pounds, into another vehicle and drove off.
   Neither guard was injured. No suspects have been identified,
said sheriff's Capt. Neil Flood.
   ``There are a lot of questions, obviously, about the manner of
the heist,'' Sheriff Andrew P. Meloni said. ``It appeared to be
well-planned.''
   The sheriff would not say whether the robbery of the Armored
Motor Service of America truck could have been an inside job.
   The two guards, who worked for the company a total of 18 months,
were questioned all day and into the evening by FBI and sheriff's
officials, said Flood.
   The guards, whose names were not released, are ``not really''
suspects, the sheriff said. ``They obviously need to be talked
to,'' he said.
   AMSA controller George Clark said the guards agree to submit to
lie-detector tests as a condition of employment.
   To prevent inside jobs, work crews are rotated, Clark said. It
was unclear how long Tuesday's crew had worked together.
   The truck had left the company's offices in the Rochester suburb
of Chili for the Federal Reserve Bank branch in Buffalo.
   During the stop at a store, a gunman shoved the barrel of a
shotgun into an opening in the truck's cab and seized the vehicle
from the driver, officials said. The other guard was taken hostage
when she returned from the store.
   The guards freed themselves within 15 minutes of the robbery,
drove to AMSA and reported the hold-up, Meloni said.
   Guards carry .38-caliber revolvers.
   Clark said the coffee-and-sandwiches stop was not against
company rules. ``But it is strongly discouraged from a security
standpoint,'' he said. ``It's hard to knock off a moving truck.''
   Officials are reviewing the company's records and looking for
witnesses who might have seen the armored car, Meloni said.
   The robbery is at least the second-largest theft in U.S. history
and the largest involving an armored car. In 1982, about $11
million was reported taken from the Sentry Armored Car Courier Co.
office in New York City. But authorities said much of the money may
have been previously embezzled.
   In 1985, $7.9 million was stolen from a Wells Fargo depot in New
York by masked gunmen. In 1983, robbers took gold estimated to be
worth up to $11 million from a smelting company and jewelry
wholesaler in North Miami, Fla.
   The robbery Tuesday was the second multimillion-dollar robbery
of an AMSA truck in 13 months. In 1989, two men drove a one-ton
armored truck through a garage door in East Syracuse,
pistol-whipped two guards and stole $2.9 million.
   Two suspects are on trial in federal court in Syracuse. One of
the guards pleaded guilty last year to taking part in the robbery.

<HEAD>Court Limits Power of Environmentalists to Use Federal Courts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the power of
environmentalists to use the federal courts to prevent opening of
federal lands to commercial development.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a pro-environmentalist
ruling that had been challenged by the Bush administration.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the National
Wildlife Federation failed to provide enough _ or the right kind of
_ evidence to justify its suit against the Interior Department.
   The federation challenged the department's plans to change the
status of some 180 million acres of public land in the West and
Alaska, more than a fourth of all public lands in the nation.
   The federation said it was suing to ``protect federal lands
against unwise or premature disposition and development,''
including millions of acres to be opened up to mining and mineral
leasing.
   The decision to reclassify the land for development and other
uses was made by the Reagan administration in 1985, following a
policy instituted by then-Secretary James G. Watt in 1981.
   The wildlife federation said the Reagan administration violated
federal law by opening the land to development without following
procedures in the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act
(FLPMA).
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said the federation and
its 4.5 million members have legal standing to sue based on
affidavits by members that they use some of the land for recreation.
   For example, federation member Peggy K. Peterson said she uses
land in the South Pass-Green Mountain area of Wyoming.
   Scalia today agreed with the Bush administration that the
federation may not base a wholesale challenge to the Interior
Department's reclassification on allegations such a change will
adversely affect a few people.
   Challenges must be mounted case by case, Scalia said, unless
Congress changes the law to permit a broader attack or federal
officials bow to such broader demands by environmentalists.
   ``The case-by-case approach ... is understandably frustrating to
an organization ... which has as its objective across-the-board
protection of our nation's wildlife and the streams and forests
that support it,'' he said.
   But, Scalia said, it is not up to the courts to come up with
far-reaching solutions when not authorized by law.
   ``Until confided to us, more sweeping actions are for the other
branches'' of government, he said.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting were Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens.
   Blackmun, in an opinion for all four, said the wildlife
federation presented enough evidence in affidavits by two members
to warrant a full trial of its suit.
   He said today's ruling characterized the federal land management
program as ``1250 or so individual classification'' decisions. But,
Blackmun said, ``The majority offers no argument in support of this
conclusory assertion and I am far from certain that the
characterization is an accurate one.''
   The case is Lujan vs. National Wildlife Federation, 89-640.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Newspaper over Rape Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rape victim is suing the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram for publishing an account of the attack that she says
contained identifying details even though it did not give her name.
   The woman says the story violated her right to privacy as a
victim of sexual assault. She is seeking at least $8,000 in damages
for alleged emotional and physical distress.
   The Star-Telegram did not publish the woman's name or address in
reports about the Sept. 24 rape.
   The lawsuit contends the story included information about the
rape and about her, including her age, occupation and the make of
her car, that made her identity ``readily apparent'' to people in
her community.
   As a result of the story, the woman has suffered ``extreme and
severe embarrassment, humiliation and acute depression,'' the
lawsuit alleges.
   The lawsuit seeks $3,000 in damages to pay for psychological
treatment and $5,000 in past and future lost wages.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year gave the news media added
protection in reporting such crimes. The court ruled that the
weekly Florida Star did not have to pay damages to a rape victim
whose name it published.
   The ruling limited states' power to punish the reporting of
truthful information that is lawfully obtained. Florida law makes
it a crime to publish the names of victims of sexual assault. The
Florida Star said the rape victim's name was published
inadvertently after it was released by a sheriff's department.
   Texas law does not prohibit publishing rape victims' names, nor
does it prohibit law enforcement agencies from releasing the names,
said Star-Telegram Associate Executive Editor Phil Record.
   ``We were just surprised at this kind of suit because we don't
see that it has a great deal of merit in it,'' Record said Tuesday.

   People charged with child abuse are not always
entitled to a face-to-face confrontation with their young accusers,
the Supreme Court ruled today.
   In a decision expected to make it easier to prosecute suspected
child abusers, the court said the Constitution allows for
exceptions to such potentially traumatic confrontations.
   The decisions were announced as the court ended its 1989-90
term, which included major rulings on abortion, the right to die,
flag burning, political patronage, police efforts to stop drunken
drivers, and prayer groups in public schools.
   In a major victory for affirmative action, the court today
upheld federal policies that favor minorities in awarding broadcast
licenses.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Federal Communications
Commission policies do not discriminate unlawfully.
   The child-abuse decision will let states use some techniques to
protect minors _ particularly those called to testify against their
accused abusers _ from a face-to-face courtroom confrontation.
   More than half the states have enacted such measures already.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the child-molesting
conviction of a Maryland day-care center owner even though four
young children were allowed to testify out of her presence. The
children testified over one-way, closed-circuit television.
   But by a separate 5-4 vote, the court refused to reinstate an
Idaho woman's child-abuse conviction thrown out by the state's
highest court because the child did not testify. Rather, a
pediatrician testified at the trial about his interview with the
2-year-old alleged victim.
   Writing for the court in the Maryland case, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said, ``Where necessary to protect a child witness from
trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical presence
of the defendant, at least where such trauma would impair the
child's ability to communicate, the (Constitution's) confrontation
clause does not prohibit use of a procedure'' other than a
face-to-face confrontation.
   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Antonin Scalia, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Writing for the dissenters, Scalia said, ``Seldom has this court
failed so conspicuously to sustain a categorical guarantee of the
Constitution against the tide of prevailing current opinion.''
   The Constitution's Sixth Amendment, in part, says, ``In all
criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be
confronted with the witnesses against him.''
   ``Though we reaffirm the importance of face-to-face
confrontation with witnesses appearing at trial, we cannot say that
such confrontation is an indispensable element of the Sixth
Amendment's guarantee of the right to confront one's accusers,''
the majority said.
   States in recent years increasingly have sought to protect young
witnesses, particularly those testifying in child-abuse cases.
   The number of such cases is growing. More than 2.2 million
child-abuse reports were filed in 1988, according to the National
Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.
   Testimony by children on closed-circuit TV, on videotape,
through one-way mirrors or behind screens has been allowed in some
criminal cases.
   Today's decision in the Maryland case allows those techniques,
as long as they ensure ``the reliability of the evidence by
subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing.''
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Limited the power of environmentalists to use the federal
courts to prevent opening of federal lands to commercial
development.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a pro-environmentalist
ruling that had been challenged by the Bush administration.
   _ Upheld Arizona's death penalty law in a decision that also
removes a constitutional shadow from similar laws in Idaho and
Montana.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that the Arizona law is valid
even though judges, not juries, decide whether a murder was a crime
for which death can be the punishment.
   _ Ruled that most of the nation's post offices may ban all
soliciting on their property.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said a regulation imposing such a
blanket ban does not violate free-speech rights.
   In a significant ruling on the protections offered by the
Constitution's First Amendment, the court reinstated the
convictions of two political activists who solicited contributions
and distributed literature from the sidewalk outside a post office
in Bowie, Md.
   The justices in 1988 struck down an Iowa man's sexual-assault
conviction because two 13-year-old girls were allowed to testify
while shielded from his view by a large screen placed in the
courtroom between them and the defendant. They cited a Sixth
Amendment violation.
   But the 1988 ruling appeared to leave unanswered whether there
may be exceptions to the face-to-face requirement.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals threw out Sandra Craig's
conviction, saying her 7-year-old accuser and three other young
witnesses wrongly were allowed, to testify over closed-circuit TV.
   They testified from a room outside the courtroom with only a
prosecutor and one of Mrs. Craig's lawyers present. Mrs. Craig and
her other lawyer remained in the courtroom, where they could watch
the testimony and talk privately by telephone to the other lawyer.
   The state court ruled that Mrs. Craig was entitled to a new
trial on charges she sexually molested a girl who attended her
Clarksville, Md., day-care center.
   She had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for her 1987
conviction on those charges.
   Today, the nation's highest court said the Maryland court was
wrong.
   Mrs. Craig also faces charges stemming from the alleged
molestation of 12 other children who attended the day-care center.
   In the Idaho case, Laura Lee Wright of Boise was convicted of
lewd conduct committed on her daughters, who were then 5 and 2. She
was sentenced to 20 years in prison before the state Supreme Court
threw out her conviction.
   The state court said the trial judge wrongly allowed a
pediatrician who had examined the younger girl to testify about
what she told him. The girl did not testify, and therefore could
not be cross-examined by Mrs. Wright's lawyer.
   The state court said the pediatrician's testimony lacked
``particularized guarantees of trustworthiness'' because it was not
tape-recorded, because he asked leading questions and had a
preconceived idea of what facts the child should be disclosing.
   O'Connor, joined by the four dissenters in the Maryland case,
upheld the state court ruling while not agreeing with how that
ruling was reached.
   ``Given the presumption of inadmissibility accorded accusatory
hearsay statements ... we agree with the court below that the state
has failed to show that the younger daughter's incriminating
statements to the pediatrician possessed sufficient particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness under the confrontation clause to
overcome that presumption,'' O'Connor said.
   The cases are Maryland vs. Craig, 89-478, and Idaho vs. Wright,
89-260.

   Nelson Mandela, who refuses to renounce violence
for the cause of racial equality, arrived in the birthplace of
America's apostle of non-violence today to lay a wreath at the
grave of Martin Luther King Jr.
   Mandela emerged smiling and waving from his chartered jet at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. He was greeted by a
marching band and about 200 invited guests, including Gov. Joe
Frank Harris, Mayor Maynard Jackson and Coretta Scott King, widow
of the slain civil rights leader.
   About 100 people lined an access road nearby, hoping for a
glimpse of Mandela, who came from Washington. Security was heavy.
   Mandela quickly reminded Atlanta's civil rights leaders, some of
whom have gently criticized him for not renouncing violence, that
he sees South Africa's black movement as different from the U.S.
civil rights struggle.
   ``Unlike you, we are still under the grip of white supremacy,''
he said in a brief address at the airport.
   Mandela then spoke briefly to reporters, saying, ``Non-violence
is a good policy when conditions permit.''
   Mandela was scheduled to lay a wreath at King's tomb and then to
address an audience of civil rights activists at Big Bethel AME
Church. A later address at Morehouse College was canceled, but
Mandela still planned to address a sold-out rally at Grant Field.
   Mandela's schedule has been trimmed down to give the 71-year-old
leader more rest. He has been touring the United States since June
20.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the King-founded Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, hoped Mandela's visit would
inspire black Americans to ``see that we can overcome.''
   ``We think we have problems. He's overcome and I hope he lights
our fire,'' Lowery said.
   In turn, some civil rights figures hoped a first-hand look at
racial progress in the South would lead Mandela to try to avoid
violence in his homeland.
   Others, including King's widow said more attention is paid to
Mandela's stance on violence than to the South African government's
violence toward blacks.
   As chairman of the Mandela visit host committee, Mrs. King said
she hoped to show the African National Congress leader Atlanta's
``impressive spirit of interracial cooperation.''
   Civil rights leaders who worked with King during the 1960s
acknowledged that King's staunch policy of non-violence conflicts
with Mandela's stand, but they are sympathetic to the black
nationalist leader.
   In general, they say it is more important to free South African
blacks than to insist on doing it their way.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights veteran who has been
jailed 40 times, said: ``Without violence, we were able to turn the
South into a New South. Maybe being there will give him the will to
try, as much as possible, to avert violence.''
   ``If our experiences in desegregation can be helpful, we will
offer them, Lowery said.
   ``There are some differences in every revolution, but I have to
advocate non-violence. I've seen the results,'' said the Rev. Hosea
Williams, King's field lieutenant during the 1960s.
   ``I would tell Mr. Mandela to please study and evaluate the
teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. before deciding that violence
is the only way to bring about needed social change.''

   Negotiators at East-West talks on
reducing conventional forces in Europe agreed today to limit the
number of tanks and armored combat vehicles each alliance may have,
diplomats said.
   Agreement on the two weapons categories will speed negotiations
for an initial agreement at the talks by the end of this year, they
said.
   ``This is a very major step,'' a Western diplomat told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. ``This is the heart of
the treaty. Along with artillery, these are the chief components of
ground offensive forces. Limiting this is one of the major steps in
which these negotiations will increase stability in Europe. It is
certainly one of the key elements.''
   The breakthrough proposal on tanks and armored combat vehicles
came from the French and the Poles.
   The French-Polish proposal, which was adopted by the delegates,
establishes an overall ceiling for armored combat vehicles of
30,000 on each side and a ceiling of 20,000 tanks for each side.
   It also sets a minimum weight limit of 16.5 tons for tanks
regardless of whether they have tracks or wheels. One of the more
contentious issues at the talks has been finding common definitions
for tanks and other armaments.
   The agreement also no longer makes a distinction between armored
troop carriers and other armored vehicles, thus removing a further
obstacle.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact delegates referred to the proposal as a
``package'' noting the link between definitions and limits on
numbers and weights.
   They said the future treaty text will include a long list of the
arms they would carry, thus classifying all the weapons the two
sides currently have.
   Polish chief delegate Wlodzimierz Konarski told reporters
earlier this month that this would be unprecedented in East-West
relations and that these lists would become the basis for the
reductions.
   According to U.S. estimates, the West has 23,600 tanks against
Warsaw Pact's estimated 52,500. NATO has about 34,025 armored
combat vehicles and the Warsaw Pact 59,400, according to U.S.
estimates last year.
   The talks on Conventional Forces in Europe are designed to
reduce troops and non-nuclear weapons of the two alliances from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Ural mountains. The 16 NATO and seven Warsaw
Pact countries are participating.
   Both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by
December, when leaders from 35 nations, including the 23 involved
in the talks, meet in Paris.
   The other 12 participants are neutral and non-aligned countries
in Europe that would also be affected by reducing tensions on the
continent.
   Eastern and Western diplomats said there were still many
outstanding issues to be resolved before a final agreement can be
signed.
   They said the issues of ceilings and definitions of aircraft and
helicopters as well as terms for verification still remained to be
settled.
   The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops each
in Central Europe, with the United States permitted to maintain up
to 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe.
   NATO has proposed a maximum of 4,700 combat aircraft for each
side, with an additional 500 air defense interceptors, but the East
wants a higher ceiling.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Delegation Traveling to Moscow, More Meetings Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation of Lithuanian leaders, including the
Baltic republic's president and prime minister, left for Moscow
today for likely meetings with top Soviet officials, a spokesman
said.
   The parliament of the break-away republic is scheduled on
Thursday to begin debating a possible suspension of its March 11
declaration of independence that has put it at loggerheads with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Darius Suziedelis of the Lithuanian parliament's Information
Bureau, said in a telephone interview that President Vytautas
Landsbergis and Prime Minister Kazimere Prunskiene were leading a
six-member delegation to the Soviet capital.
   The delegation also included Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas
Ozolas and legislative leader Egidius Bickauskas.
   Suziedelis said little was known about their agenda in Moscow.
But it was unlikely that the group would travel to the Soviet
capital without an understanding that a meeting would be held with
top Soviet officials.
   Landsbergis met with Gorbachev on Tuesday morning, and then
returned to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
   He told the Supreme Council parliament upon his return that he
received a better understanding of what kind of a compromise might
be acceptable to Gorbachev, and that he might return for more talks
with the Soviet leader.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, asking parliament on Tuesday to freeze the
declaration of independence, told the republic's lawmakers that
early independence is impossible without a compromise with the
Kremlin.
   She said Gorbachev agreed in a telephone call Tuesday after
meeting with Landsbergis that he would end a crippling economic
embargo and begin negotiations that ``will discuss a different
status for Lithuania, including as an independent state.''
   But the only official statement from Moscow was much more
toughly worded.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, quoting what it said was an
official report on the meeting with Landsbergis, said the
Lithuanian president was told talks can only be held ``if Lithuania
declares a moratorium and suspends the act of March 11 for a period
of talks. They can be held only in the context of an
inter-republican dialogue on the preparation of a new union treaty
and the formation of a union of sovereign socialists states.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adnan Khashoggi's lawyer said today the
government's case against his client was built on contrived
allegations against the Saudi financier.
   The lawyer, James Linn, said no evidence exists that Khashoggi
ever plotted with former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and
Imelda Marcos to circumvent a U.S. court injunction freezing their
assets in 1986.
   ``Where is the proof? Where is the evidence of them forming a
criminal agreement?'' Linn demanded in a closing statement before
the jury in U.S. District Court.
   The case is expected to go to the jury on Thursday following a
government rebuttal.
   Prosecutors, possibly with political ambitions, envisioned a
``case of the century'' when they first brought the indictment in
1988 against former President Marcos, Mrs. Marcos, Khashoggi and
several others, Linn said.
   After Marcos died last September, he said, ``you got a widow,
you got a Saudi businessman. It takes a lot out of the case.''
   But, he said, the government chose to proceed with the thought:
``Let's see if we can convict this man because of his yachts and
airplanes, or Mrs. Marcos because of her shoes and her shopping.''
   He asked jurors to consider whether Khashoggi, famous for his
business acumen, would agree to illegally take over ownership of
four New York buildings secretly owned by the Marcoses _
``multimillion-dollar buildings that were losing a million dollars
a month.''
   A day earlier, Mrs. Marcos' attorney urged jurors to acquit the
former Philippine first lady of all charges against her, saying
that even one verdict of guilty would be ``a stink and a smear on
her as though it were fifty.''
   In a dramatic four-hour summation that brought Mrs. Marcos to
tears at the end, lawyer Gerry Spence ridiculed the government's
fraud and racketeering case as a ``fantasy'' spun by questionable
witnesses and unsupported by convincing evidence.
   ``The only thing that matters is the facts, and the facts in
this case demand that you free Mrs. Marcos, that she not stand here
and undergo this torture for another day,'' said Spence.
   ``She committed no crime except of loving a man for 35 years,
raising his children, taking his lavish gifts and being his ardent
supporter.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband embezzle
$222 million from their country's treasury to buy four New York
buildings, jewelry and art works.
   She faces up to 50 years in prison and $1 million in fines if
convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and
obstruction of justice.
   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with mail fraud and obstructing
justice for allegedly helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of
the properties after a U.S. court order froze their assets. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   Wearing her customary black dress of mourning for her husband,
who died last September, Mrs. Marcos sat with downcast eyes through
most of Spence's oration, occasionally smiling or fighting back
tears.
   At the end, she tearfully embraced the silver-haired lawyer and
kissed him on both cheeks.

   Mokbul Kazi thought it wasn't much of a
deal when he tried to kill a snake with a spear.
   The Bangladeshi farmer was used to snakes slithering into his
home, especially when the summer monsoons flushed them out of their
holes.
   This one was different. It was wounded by Kazi's attack, but
clung tenaciously to the mud and straw ceiling of his hut, the
Khabar newspaper reported Wednesday.
   That night, about fifty snakes invaded Kazi's hut, hissing
disapprovingly.
   Kazi and his family fled.
   The snakes stayed for a week. They left Saturday, when their
wounded comrade died, the newspaper said.

   Wind erosion eased its grip on the Great
Plains this season because of improved moisture conditions in much
of the region, according to a final survey by the Agriculture
Department.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Tuesday that an estimated 7.8 million acres were
damaged by wind in the 10 states that make up the Great Plains,
down 45 percent from 14.3 million acres in 1988-89.
   The agency measures wind damage during a seven-month season that
runs from Nov. 1 through May 31, when winds are usually the
strongest and soils the driest. The survey covers 541 counties in
the 10 states.
   ``Most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in
Colorado and Kansas, where land damaged from wind decreased from
6.5 million acres last year to 463,000 acres this year for the two
states,'' Scaling said.
   The greatest damage was in North Dakota, in its third year of
severe drought, he said. The state reported 2.9 million acres
damaged this season, compared with 2.3 million last year and a
record 3.5 million acres in 1987-88.
   North Dakota accounted for more than one-third of the total wind
erosion in the 10-state region.
   Kansas, after setting a record with 5.1 million acres damaged
last year (largely because of a one-day storm that damaged nearly
4.8 million acres), reported only 190,000 acres damaged this season.
   The least damage was in Nebraska, with 130,000 acres damaged,
compared with 192,000 last year.
   Officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the Great
Plains was 15.3 million acres in 1954-55, the year that the agency
began annual records.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
wind-damaged acres in 1989-90 with damage in 1988-89, included:
   _ Colorado, 273,731 and 1,403,655.
   _ Kansas, 189,600 and 5,126,250.
   _ Montana, 1,249,665 and 1,832,025.
   _ Nebraska, 130,115 and 191,605.
   _ New Mexico, 248,500 and 117,950.
   _ North Dakota, 2,932,687 and 2,297,681.
   _ Oklahoma, 136,800 and 111,930.
   _ South Dakota, 601,830 and 678,550.

   An additional $11 million has been reallocated
to 46 states for the Agriculture Department's special supplemental
food program for women, infants and children.
   About half the states were running out of money for the program,
known as WIC. Higher food costs, especially for dairy and citrus
products, were said to be the main factors.
   Officials said Tuesday the department regularly reallocates
unspent and carryover WIC funds to states in need or in danger of
running out before the end of the fiscal year.
   ``Many states have managed their WIC caseloads carefully enough
that they aren't having any budgetary problems,'' said Betty Jo
Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and Nutrition
Service.
   ``Others have had to economize ... by choosing less expensive
but nutritious foods,'' she said.
   Nationally, the reallocated money will allow states to provide
an additional 300,000 food packages to participants over the final
three months of this fiscal year, Nelsen said.
   The funds will be available to states July 1 and will supplement
more than $2 billion allocated for WIC in the current fiscal year
that began last Oct. 1. More than 4.5 million women, infants and
children participate.

   Ex-model Rasheeda Moore testified today that
she and Mayor Marion Barry used drugs ``over 100 times'' _
sometimes more than once a day _ during a three-year romance.
   Moore, who cooperated in the FBI sting operation that led to
Barry's arrest, testified that she and the mayor used cocaine at
her mother's home and a dozen other locations from 1986 to 1988.
   The drug use continued after her ``intimate relationship'' with
Barry ended, she testified at the mayor's cocaine and perjury
trial. She said she ended the affair because ``I was losing
myself.''
   Barry sat 50 feet away in the courtroom while Moore offered her
account. Barry's wife, Effi, sat nearby in a front row seat.
   Asked how frequently she and Barry used drugs, she responded
``over 100 times. There were times we did it more than once a day,
sometimes two to three times.''
   ``There was so much drug use over that period of time, and I was
losing myself ... losing my character regarding my children,''
Moore testified. ``I wanted to get my life in order.''
   Moore helped the government in the FBI sting operation, which
resulted in the mayor's arrest Jan. 18 at the Vista Hotel. It was
during their meeting in a hotel room that the FBI videotaped the
mayor allegedly smoking crack cocaine.
   It was Moore who persuaded Barry to come to the hotel room. The
videotape of their meeting is expected to be played following her
testimony.
   Moore began testifying after assistant U.S. Attorney Judith
Retchin told the jury the mayor's ``drug dealings'' with the mayor
included powder cocaine, crack, marijuana and opium. Retchin's
statement is the first time that opium use by the mayor has been
suggested.
   Prosecutors have said Moore and Barry carried on a ``torrid''
relationship for three years. Barry's wife, Effi, sat in the front
row of the courtroom as Moore took the stand.
   Prosecutors said they want to ask Moore about drugs other than
cocaine, even though Barry is charged with crimes only in
connection with alleged cocaine possession.
   Retchin explained that because Barry plans to raise the defense
that he was entrapped by overzealous government investigators,
Moore should be permitted to testify about the other substances to
show he was predisposed to drug use.
   Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy said marijuana use does not
suggest ``predisposition or propensity for crack cocaine.''
   On Tuesday, tape recordings of Barry's grand jury appearances in
January 1989 were played in court.
   Barry told the grand jury he had no indication that a friend,
Charles Lewis, was involved with drugs and that he and Lewis had
not given drugs to each other. Those assertions form the basis of
the three felony perjury charges against the three-term mayor.
   Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, testified last week that he and
Barry used crack cocaine, powdered cocaine and marijuana repeatedly
from 1986 through December 1988. Barry's grand jury appearance came
the following month.
   There was nothing ``unusual or criminal'' about his visits to
Lewis' Washington hotel room in December 1988, Barry said in his
sworn testimony.
   He told the grand jury in January 1989 that he gave Lewis money
for food on occasion, but not more than $60 in total. Lewis
testified that Barry gave him hundreds of dollars for drugs, even
sending some money over to Lewis' hotel with one of the mayor's
security guards.
   Barry recalled that his first visit to Lewis' hotel room was on
Dec. 17, 1988. Lewis testified last week that the two smoked crack
cocaine the night of Dec. 16, 1988.
   Lewis testified last week that he left his hotel room to buy
crack when drug supplies got low on Dec. 19, 1988, while Barry
stayed in the room. Barry told the grand jury he didn't recall
Lewis leaving the room.
   Barry said he spent an hour or less in the room on the night of
Dec. 19. Lewis testified the mayor was there well past midnight and
long after a televised Monday night football game had ended.
   The mayor told the grand jury that he and a city government
attorney, James McWilliams, discussed McWilliams' job problems
during the game.
   McWilliams testified last week that he tried repeatedly to do
just that, but that he wasn't successful and at one point found
Barry slumped over on a bathroom seat an arm's length from drug
paraphernalia.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Wednesday holding that people charged with child abuse are
not always entitled to a face-to-face confrontation with their
accusers:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Maryland v. Sandra Ann Craig, Main Opinion Written by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor:
   </HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We have never held, however, that the Confrontation Clause
guarantees criminal defendants the absolute right to a face-to-face
meeting with witnesses against them at trial...
   In sum, our precedents establish that ``th Confrontation Clause
reflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial,''
... a preference that ``must occasionally give way to
considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.
   That the face-to-face confrontation requirement is not absolute
does not, of course, mean that it may easily be dispensed with. Our
precedents confirm that a defendant's right to confront accusatory
witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face
confrontation at trial only where denial of such confrontation is
necessary to further an important public policy and only where the
reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.
   We likewise conclude today that a state's interest in the
physical and psychological well-being of child abuse victims may be
sufficiently important to outweigh, at least in some cases, a
defendant's right to face his or her accusers in court. That a
significant majority of states has enacted statutes to protect
child witnesses from the trauma of giving testimony in child abuse
cases attests to the widespread belief in the importance of such a
public policy.
   Thirty-seven states, for example, permit the use of videotaped
testimony of sexually abused children, 24 states have authorized
the use of one-way circuit television testimony in child abuse
cases; and eight states authorize the use of a two-way system in
which the child-witness is permitted to see the courtroom and the
defendant on a video monitor and in which the jury and judge is
permitted to view the child during testimony.
   Given the state's traditional and ``transcendent interest in
protecting the welfare of children,'' and buttressed by the growing
body of academic literature documenting the psychological trauma
suffered by child abuse victims who must testify in court, we will
not second-guess the considered judgment of the Maryland
Legislature regarding the importance of its interest in protecting
child abuse victims from the emotional trauma of testifying.
   Accordingly, we hold that, if the State makes an adequate
showing of necessity, the state interest in protecting child
witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is
sufficiently important to justify the use of a special procedure
that permits a child witness in such cases to testify at trial
against a defendant in the absence of face-to-face confrontation
with the defendant.
   The requisite finding of necessity must of course be a case
specific one: the trial court must hear evidence and determine
whether use of the one-way closed circuit television procedure is
necessary to protect the welfare of the particular child witness
who seeks to testify.
   To be sure, face-to-face confrontation may be said to cause
trauma for the very purpose of eliciting truth, but we think that
the use of Maryland's special procedure, where necessary to further
the important state interest in preventing trauma to child
witnesses in child abuse cases, adequately ensures the accuracy of
the testimony and preserves the adversary nature of the trial.
   Indeed, where face-to-face confrontation causes significant
emotional distress in a child witness, there is evidence that such
confrontation would in fact disserve the Confrontation Clause's
truth-seeking goal.
   In sum, we conclude that where necessary to protect a child
witness from trauma that would be caused by testifying in the
physical presence of the defendant, at least where such trauma
would impair the child's ability to communicate, the Confrontation
Clause does not prohibit use of a procedure that, despite the
absence of face-to-face confrontation, ensures the reliability of
the evidence by subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing and
thereby preserves the essence of effective confrontation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dissenting Opinion Written by Justice Antonin Scalia:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Seldom has this Court failed so conspicuously to sustain a
categorical guarantee of the Constitution against the tide of
prevailing current opinion. ... The purpose of enshrining this
protection in the Constitution was to assure that none of the many
policy interests from time to time pursued by statutory law could
overcome a defendant's right to face his or her accusers in court.
   This debate is not an appropriate one. I have no need to defend
the value of confrontation, because the Court has no authority to
question it. It is not within our charge to speculate that, ``where
face-to-face confrontation causes significant emotional distress in
a child witness,'' confrontation might ``in fact disserve the
Confrontation Clause's truth-seeking goal.''
   If so, that is a defect in the Constitution which should be
amended by the procedures provided for such an eventuality, but
cannot be corrected by judicial pronouncement that it is archaic,
contrary to ``widespread belief'' and thus null and void. For good
or bad, the Sixth Amendment requires confrontation, and we are not
at liberty to ignore it.
   The Court today has applied ``interest-balancing'' analysis
where the text of the Constitution simply does not permit it. We
are not free to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of clear and
explicit constitutional guarantees, and then to adjust their
meaning to comport with our findings.

<TEXT>
   A top union leader and former finance minister
said his home was attacked early Wednesday by a group of masked men
who used iron bars to smash windows and damage his car.
   Mahendra Chaudhry, who also is a senior member of the deposed
Coalition party, claimed the incident was politically motivated.
   ``They came to intimidate us,'' said Chaudhry, secretary of the
Fiji Trade Union Congress. ``It took only three or four minutes and
was well-planned. They acted as if they were on a mission. All we
could hear was shattering glass.''
   Chaudhry and his wife, Veer, were not hurt in the incident,
which was being investigated by police.
   Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, was finance minister in the
multiracial Coalition government. That government ruled for only a
month before being overthrown in a military coups in 1987.
   As the union leader, he has been at the forefront of opposition
to a draft constitution intended to give the minority indigenous
Melanesians political dominance over other races.
   The draft was approved by the country's high chiefs Monday and
is expected to take effect soon, despite Coalition claims that it
is racist.
   Last weekend, Chaudhry called on ethnic Indians to seek overseas
support, such as trade bans and sanctions, if the draft was enacted.

<TEXT>
   Canada as a country is an unnatural union.
   Less a nation than a grouping of regional entities with vastly
differing interests and outlooks, it always has been difficult to
govern. Following the failure of the Meech Lake constitutional
accord, it may become even harder.
   ``It's not a natural state, either economically or
geographically, and certainly not culturally,'' constitutional
expert John D. Whyte said.
   ``And the one cultural linkage that we did have, living under a
British crown, has absolutely disappeared,'' said Whyte, dean of
the Queen's University law school.
   Is Canada impossible to govern?
   ``We're about to find out,'' said Joseph Jockel, a specialist in
Canadian studies at St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y.
``Beyond the short-term squabblings and constitutional theory,
there is a combat between two visions of what Canada is, and they
may be incompatible.
   ``The majority of Quebecois see Canada as binational, a pact
between two nations and two people in which one is Quebec and one
the people of Canada,'' Jockel said. ``Meech was to have addressed
that.
   ``Most English Canadians see Canada as a country of 10 provinces
and of one people, to which some special characteristics in Quebec
have to be accommodated.
   ``Meech really crashed on the rocks of those two visions,'' he
said.
   Meech Lake was an attempt to gain French-speaking Quebec's
signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. The agreement contained
five points covering the province's most important concerns,
including one clause designating Quebec a ``distinct society''
within Canada.
   The clause had little practical impact but was a symbol of
enormous importance to the 6.5 million Quebecois, who make up about
25 percent of Canada's 26 million people.
   Other provisions involved a new constitutional amending formula,
some powers over immigration, a limit on federal spending authority
and a voice in appointing Supreme Court justices.
   The measure required ratification by the federal government and
the legislatures of all 10 provinces. It died when Newfoundland
Premier Clyde Wells decided not to put it to a vote and when a
member of the Manitoba assembly managed to delay debate beyond
Saturday's deadline.
   The failure of the measure angered and embittered many
Quebecois, who view it as a rejection by English Canada. The long
debate over the amendment and the numerous reservations by other
provinces gave rise to increased nationalism in the province.
   The geography and history of Canada make it difficult to find
national consensus, and in the case of constitutional amendments
such as Meech Lake, unanimity. Regional interests are nearly
impossible to overcome.
   British Columbia in the far west has much more in common with
the northwest United States than it does with Ontario or Quebec.
Economically, its gaze is as much oriented toward the Orient as it
is eastward to the rest of Canada.
   In the east, the impoverished maritime provinces of
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick
depend to a large extent on fish and on government handouts for
economic survival.
   Newfoundland only joined the Canadian federation in 1949, and
many Newfoundlanders still talk about ``going up to Canada.''
   Alberta in the west, with its rich resources in oil and gas,
feels its political clout is not equivalent to its economic might.
That is one reason it fights so hard for reform of the moribund
Canadian Senate.
   The prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba have always
been seen as an agricultural vastness and market for central
Canada's products.
   Quebec, with its historical, linguistic and cultural
differences, is clearly distinct from the rest of Canada. It long
has felt more comfortable in its close relations with the
northeastern United States, and more recently with Ontario, than
with the rest of Canada.
   ``Just look at the Quebec license plates, from Boston to
Florida,'' one Quebec official said, noting the French province was
wholeheartedly behind the U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement of a
year ago.
   A common feeling is resentment of central Canada and opposition
to Ottawa.
   Because 62 percent of Canada's people live in Ontario and
Quebec, and because nearly 30 percent of all the people in the
country live either in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, political
power has been unbalanced.
   And while Meech Lake frequently was portrayed as French vs.
English Canada _ which it was to some extent _ it was far more
complicated.
   Special treatment for Quebec was psychologically unacceptable
for many English Canadians, and politically unacceptable for others.
   ``Now Canada is really going to be tested,'' Jockel said. ``We
can count on Quebec putting forth a new agenda even more explicity
based on the notion of Canada as two people.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, whose leadership in
Conservative Judaism helped pave the way for the ordination of
women, has died at age 66.
   Kelman died Tuesday of cancer at the New York University Medical
Center, according to a colleague, Rabbi Julra Harlow.
   Known as ``a rabbi's rabbi,'' Kelman never led a congregation
but was a major force in the Conservative movement. As the
executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly, he was mentor
to hundreds of rabbis, guiding them spiritually and pragmatically.
   During the 1960s, he was among Jewish leaders who participated
in civil rights marches with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the
South.
   Kelman was born in Vienna in 1923 and moved to Canada with his
family as a young boy. His father, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kelman, died
when Wolfe Kelman was 13. Left with six children, his mother
stepped into the role of community leader in Toronto, where she
offered religious and personal guidance.
   ``It was her example that made me believe women could function
as rabbis,'' Kelman said years later. Women were first ordained in
Conservative Judaism in 1985.
   The standing of rabbis improved markedly over his years at the
Rabbinical Assembly. But he refused to take credit for being any
more than someone who eased the way for others.
   Survivors include his wife, the former Jacqueline Levy; a son
and two daughters.
   A funeral service was scheduled for Thursday.

   Photographs taken from the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope have not been as good as expected, the National

   The problem might be caused by all the lights in the telescope's

scheduled a news conference later today.
   The telescope was launched into orbit April 25 aboard the space

   It is designed to study the far reaches of the universe while
free from the distorting effects of earth's atmosphere.
   ``In assessing the Hubble Space Telescope's optical performance,
the orbital verification team conducted a series of focus tests,''
NASA said.
   ``The anticipated image quality was not achieved,'' it said.
``Computer models of the images indicate the source of this lesser
quality image may be what is called spherical aberration. A
spherical aberration occurs when all the lights in a mirror do not
focus precisely at the same point.''
   ``NASA managers are assessing the cause and determining what the
scientific implications are,'' the agency said.

   Philadelphia Daily News on S&amp;L crisis:
   George Bush thinks the savings and loan disaster is a bad thing.
Some of the billions in failed loans, he says, showed ``excesses''
and were ``foolish and ill-advised.'' He does not, however, think
the crazed deregulation masterminded by the Reagan and Bush
administrations had anything to do with it.
   In other words, ``It's bad, don't blame me and I don't have any
intention of doing anything to prevent it from happening again.''

   Dallas Times Herald on sexist medical research:
   It's appalling that the researchers who conduct federally funded
health studies routinely exclude women from the focus groups. But
that's exactly what's happening, congressional investigators say.
Incredibly, knowing full well that the disease to be studied
affects men and women, researchers sometimes have been given
funding by the National Institutes of Health for studies that use
only men.
   What makes the situation even more reprehensible is that the NIH
has had a policy in effect since 1986 that requires women to be
included in studies unless their presence clearly is scientifically
inappropriate. An NIH advisory committee reported in 1987 that less
than 14 percent of the institute's budget was devoted to female
health issues, according to Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., a leader
of the Congressional Caucus for Women. ...
   We agree with Mrs. Schroeder, who said what these dismal
findings reveal simply is that ``it's OK to put women's health at
risk.''
   ... The good news is that the NIH essentially agrees with Mrs.
Schroeder. William Raub, the acting NIH director, said he and his
colleagues know that they must correct the situation immediately.
The caucus and the General Accounting Office _ the investigative
branch of Congress _ must make certain Raub is held accountable.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, on libel ruling:
   The Supreme Court clarified libel case law when it ruled in
favor of a plaintiff who alleges a newspaper columnist defamed him
15 years ago.
   The columnist asserted by way of his opinion that a high school
wrestling coach and a school superintendent had lied at a hearing.
Courts in Ohio found in favor of the columnist, arguing that
opinion is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.
   The decision, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
removes opinion from this lofty perch. Rehnquist said that the
courts had misconstrued previous libel decisions by the Supreme
Court.
   In a 1974 case, Gertz vs. Welch, the court said that ``under the
First Amendment there was no such thing as a false idea.''
Rehnquist noted that the notion of ``idea'' soon became synonomous
with opinion.
   The court, including dissenting justices William Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall, said that there is a distinction between ideas
and opinions. Moreover, an opinion by implying a fact can defame.
   Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion disagrees only in the
application of the court's principle. He argued that the newspaper
columnist did not say anything defamatory, that the column was
clearly conjecture and not based on fact.
   The director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press
said the decision ``ironically is going to encourage irresponsible
commentary at the expense of well-reasoned analysis.'' Even in the
worst-case scenario this is a dubious assertion. The First
Amendment has not disappeared. The court merely removed an
artificial distinction.

   The Record of Hackensack, N.J., on a proposed free trade pact
with Mexico:
   American business would gain better access to a market of almost
100 million Mexicans. Mexico, a strategically important neighbor of
the United States, would gain needed jobs and prosperity, without a
penny in additional aid from Washington. Those are the principal
benefits that could materialize from a proposed free trade pact
between the United States and Mexico.
   In a recent meeting in Washington, President Bush and Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, president of Mexico, committed themselves in
principle to easing barriers to the flow of capital, goods and
services between the two neighbors.
   Since jobs are being exported away, why not steer them towards
Mexico, where a significant percentage of the new wages would be
spent on American goods and services? And more prosperity in Mexico
might actually ease the already high levels of migration of Mexican
workers to the United States.
   Mr. Bush and Mr. Salinas are realistic about the obstacles
ahead. But the idea is worth pursuing.

<TEXT>
   Riots against increases in food prices and
Zambia's one-party government spread from Lusaka to smaller cities
today, and troops herded protesters in one town into a sports
stadium and held them at gunpoint.
   Hospital officials said five people died today, raising the toll
to at least 20 in the worst rioting in Zambia's history. Health
officials conceded there could have been many more fatalities in
barricaded suburbs and shanties without transport or telephones.
   On the third day of protests and looting, the government
extended 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew to 24 hours.
   Civilian vigilantes patrolled the streets carrying automatic
rifles, military helicopters flew low overhead and suburban
storekeepers fired volleys of bullets to defend their wares,
wounding an unknown number of looters.
   Police officials said widespread looting took place throughout
the day at the town of Kafue, 25 miles south of Lusaka.
   Army units later herded scores of looters into a Kafue sports
stadium and held them there at gunpoint, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   Rioting also reportedly broke out late Tuesday in the
mineral-rich Copperbelt province of this south-central African
nation, where the government has more than doubled the price of
corn meal as part of subsidy-cutting reform.
   Protesters also demand an end to socialist one-party rule by
President Kenneth Kaunda in the country of 7.5 million people. It
is the most serious challenge to Kuanda's rule since he came to
power in 1964.
   Police said they had detained more than 550 people.
   Unconfirmed reports said 12 police officers were illed today
when a rampaging mob attacked Chainama police station, east of the
city center.
   The attack, if confirmed, would bring the death toll since
Monday to 32. Doctors in Lusaka today said at least 20 people died
and 190 were wounded in three days of riots.
   By noon, mobs or police had thrown up makeshift road blocks
using burned out cars or broken masonry in most suburbs. Troop
reinforcements in armored personnel carriers positioned themselves
at strategic points but did not fire.
   The windows of most stores in the downtown shopping district
have been smashed in, one witness said.
   Police spokesman Andrew Kaitisha said the arrests in Lusaka were
aimed at finding ``ringleaders'' among the thousands of protesters
who rampaged through most districts of the capital, looting stores,
burning flags and chanting anti-government slogans.
   ``They were arrested for screening and are being interviewed by
a special police team for find out who the agitators are,'' he said.
   There were no immediate details of the extent of unrest on the
Copperbelt but reports said demonstrators clashed with security
forces at the mining town of Kitwe, about 225 miles north of Lusaka.
   The violence was sparked by the June 19 increase in the price of
corn meal, the country's staple, from $2.79 per 55-pound bag to
$6.56.
   The increase was announced as part of an economic reform program
aimed at reducing government subsidies and making the economy of
one of Africa's poorest nations more commercially viable.
   It had been recommended by financial agencies and donor nations.
   The unrest took on a further political dimension as
demonstrators, mostly from Lusaka's most impoverished townships and
shanties, demanded Kaunda's ouster and an end to nearly two decades
of socialist-style one-party rule.
   Earlier this year, Kaunda promised to hold a referendum on the
future of Zambia's one-party system but no date has been set for
the vote.
   Residents of the Lusaka suburb of Chilenji said rioters smashed
their way into a home occupied by Kaunda, a former school teacher
and lay preacher before he led his nation to independence from
British colonial rule in 1964.
   The house, seen in the past as a symbol of Zambia's black
nationalist struggle against the British, was extensively damaged,
residents said.
   Student rioters have also burned the flag of Kaunda's ruling
United National Independence Party.
   Kaunda, 67, has made no official comment on the unrest.

<HEAD>Bank Nest Egg Drawing Customer Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLEBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keeping a nest egg for a rainy day at
the Bank of Boston, Connecticut branch office here is not all it's
``quacked'' up to be.
   The nest egg, actually an egg nest belonging to Paulette the
Duck, has been drawing interest, as in customer interest, since it
was built under the drive-through teller window.
   It took Paulette more than two weeks to build the nest at the
bank office, which is next door to her normal habitat, the Meadow
Brook Plantation Garden Center.
   The eggs, which Paulette has been depositing in the nest two at
a time, should mature into 13 ducklings in a month or so.
   Paulette apparently is a very protective mother-to-be and has
enlisted relatives to keep curious humans at bay.
   ``The other day, five ducks came waddling down and stood in
front of a car and wouldn't let it pass,'' teller Debbie D'Agostino
said Tuesday. ``They were all quacking at the same time.''
   For most of the last two weeks, Paulette has sat on her nest all
night and left the following morning when the bank opened. But
since Monday, she has refused to leave, despite being coaxed and
cajoled by bank workers and depositors.

   The Martinsburg (W.Va.) Evening Journal on suspension of PLO
talks:
   How drearily familiar is the criticism being made of President
Bush's decision to suspend friendly talks with the terrorist
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Eighteen months ago U.S. officials announced they would engage
in a ``dialogue'' with the PLO to help bring peace to the Middle
East. The agreement was conditioned on PLO renunciation of violence.
   Since then PLO operatives _ under orders of high-ranking PLO
officials _ have conducted several terrorist raids. One a few weeks
ago was aimed at a U.S. embassy in Israel. It was prevented only by
quick-acting Israeli police and troops.
   Bush, finally tired of PLO duplicity, last week called a halt to
the farce. He said he's suspending talks with the PLO until he has
some evidence it'll keep its end of the bargain.
   Almost immediately there was criticism. Opponents of Bush's
stance said he may have opened the door to more violence in the
Middle East.
   ...It's time to stop worrying about upsetting the PLO. It's time
to demand, as Bush is doing, that PLO leaders keep their word about
renouncing violence _ or face increasing enmity from the United
States and a step-up in aid to Israel.
   Certainly, the rabid dog has been angered. He'll probably bite
to try to force us to give in to him. But his growls should be met
by a kick in the teeth _ not a pat on the head.

   Pasadena (Calif.) Star-News on Iran earthquake:
   Wouldn't it be going against our Judeo-Christian cultural values
in the West to be any less saddened or helpful because of
yesterday's devastating earthquake in Iran than we were after the
devastating earthquake in Armenia?
   Yes _ there's no question but that it would.
   One doesn't have to flip through one's Bible long before running
into this admonition from Matthew: ``Love your enemies, bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
which despitefully use you, and persecute you.''
   ...They curse us, they hate us, they use us, they persecute us.
   They take our embassy and its people captive and ruin hundreds
of lives.
   They control the fates of dozens of innocent hostages in Lebanon.
   They put out a death sentence on an obscure Anglo-Indian writer
in a model case study of radical intolerance.
   They persecute their own people through a supposedly theocratic
people's dictatorship that ironically reminds us in its cruelty of
nothing so much as the arrogant fake monarchy it toppled.
   ...Why shed crocodile tears for them?
   Because, both soul-searching and logic will tell us, there's no
``them'' there. That is, in the great scheme of things, there are
not enough bad guys in Tehran to shake a stick at. Whereas the
bereaved peasants in northern Iran today no more invented the image
of our country as the Great Satan than they invented
high-definition TV...
   It may not ``work,'' in the sneaky, self-serving sense that's
admittedly part of this notion. If we send humanitarian aid, it may
not be admitted by the remnants of the Ayatollah Khomeini's kooky
regime. It may be considered a trick, or merely propagandistic.
   But then again, subtly and diplomatically done, such aid has a
chance of working to both of our ends: helping out people in
distress and showing them that Americans have love in their hearts
for the Iranian people, if not for their leaders.
   Self-serving? Partially. But remember that our government did
install the Shah, no swell fellow himself. This could be honest,
Judeo-Christian penance. And, cynicism aside, blessing them that
curse us isn't such a bad path to follow simply for its own sake.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the constitutionality
of roadside checkpoints:
   The Fourth Amendment protects us from ``unreasonable searches
and seizures.'' But what about roadside checkpoints, which stop
passing motorists in an effort to identify and apprehend the small
minority who are driving under the influence of alcohol? Are these
reasonable police procedures, or do they violate the Constitution.
   This past week, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that such
checkpoints are ligitimate. This was a sensible ruling: It finally
clears up a long-disputed legal issue, and also provides one more
weapon in the arsenal of those charged with limiting the highway
mayhem caused by drunk drivers.
   Writing for the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist argued
that roadside checkpoints ... meet a three-pronged test of
constitutionality.
   First, the problem being targeted is unquestionably important.
...
   Second, checkpoints constitute an effective mechanism for
identifying potentially dangerous drunk drivers. ...
   Third, checkpoints cause only minor interference with people's
liberty. ...

   The Madison (Wis.) Capital Times on Iran earthquake:
   Human tragedy on the scale that is occurring in Iran transcends
national boundaries or past political divisions. It cries out for a
worldwide response to help survivors go on with their lives, even
as they mourn their dead.
   The earthquake that shook northern Iran last Thursday turned
dozens of communities into piles of rubble that entombed thousands
of people. Fortunately, the United States was among those nations
that put aside diplomatic differences with Iran to offer
humanitarian aid.

   The Daily Telegraph, London, on aid to the Soviet Union:
   It does not ... make sense to pour large sums of Western
taxpayers' money into the bottomless pit of the Soviet Union. That
would not merely be a premature reward for inadequate economic
reform; it might actually slow the process.
   It is natural for the West Germans, flush with the world's
largest trade surplus, to wish to use this to political effect.
Other Western politicians, too, may wish they could buy Mr.
Gorbachev out of economic failure. Unfortunately, this is not an
attainable objective. There are forms of assistance to which all
should agree. The Bush administration has shown itself
encouragingly ready to foster trade, and must now persuade Congress
to agree. Subsidized American grain sales are not so different from
the kind of food aid urged by some Europeans; a little may be
politically useful. But large-scale subsidy would merely stunt the
Soviet economy's feeble efforts to generate domestic production.
Financial aid which merely reduced the Soviet Union's need to sell
gold would be an incentive, not a cure, for domestic mismanagement.
Investment, which is what the Soviet Union most needs, will come
once a market economy exists.

   Il Messaggero, Rome, on Romania:
   The recent repression and bloodshed in Bucharest reveal a new
kind of post-Communist regime in Eastern Europe. Incorrectly, it is
being called ``neo-communism.'' It is in fact something quite
different.
   Neo-communism is the courageous attempt of a Mikhail Gorbachev,
who, in the face of an incredibly difficult transition phase, is
poised to move the crisis-bound Soviet Union from Stalinism to true
democratic socialism. Even if for now it is but a vision, the
possibility cannot be excluded that from so many failings, a new,
liberal communism can be born.
   The course of Iliescu in Romania is quite different. Here there
is no transition _ only restoration. Remember the words of Elena
Ceausescu to her executioners: ``You are all my children.''
   That ominous warning, broadcast on televisions around the world,
weighs heavily on the heart. Another leopard reigns in the blood of
Bucharest.

   Weltwoche, Zurich, Switzerland, on Soviet withdrawal of troops
from Germany:
   Suppose the Soviet Union pulls its troops out of Germany. Not
much imagination is needed to predict that on the day the last
Soviet soldier has left East Germany, the call will rise in West
Germany for the withdrawal of the Western troops. Already now,
France and Britain do not dare to voice any reservations, and will
not be able to resist such demands. But the withdrawal of all
foreign troops from Germany would mean the factual end of NATO,
whether it is dissolved or not. Germany, because of its sheer size,
thus would get a special status in Europe. One does not need to
accuse the West German politicians of seeking such status. But they
or their successors, swept to power by the new nationalism and the
new sense of greatness, will be inevitably pushed in this
direction. ..The German special status will that be of a Europoean
superpower and not that of a medium power restricted and limited by
an (international) treaty.

   Mainichi Daily News, Tokyo, on the Mideast situation:
   The Middle East situation is like a mirage. From time to time
the hope for lasting peace there appears, but all too soon fades
away. At present the situation is going through a disappointing
period.
   Anticipation for peace was strong toward the end of 1988. That
was when the Palestine Liberation Organization proclaimed the
establishment of an independent Palestine state but, at the same
time, gave virtual recognition to the existence of Israel, and
announced the abandonment of terrorism. This led to the start of
direct dialogue between the U.S. government and the PLO.
   With the PLO's adoption of a realistic course and the U.S.
government's restudy of its policy toward that group, many thought
that the bottleneck in the long search for peace had at last been
removed. Eighteen months have passed since then, however, instead
of the prospect for peace becoming brighter, several events
darkening that prospect have taken place.
   The killing of Palestinian workers in the outskirts of Tel Aviv
on May 20 by ``a mentally disturbed man'' led to protests and a
general strike by Palestinians.
   Then on May 30, armed groups believed to be members of a radical
PLO wing landed from speedboats at two bathing beaches near Tel
Aviv. The raid was checked by Israeli troops, but the question
remains as to whether this was a violation of the PLO's pledge ``to
abandon terrorism.''
   If the U.S. government considers this to be a violation, there
is the possibility that the dialogue with the PLO will be halted or
interrupted temporarily. This would deliver a big blow to the peace
efforts. ...
   At a time when there is little prospect for improvement of the
situation, all those concerned should endeavor not to make the
situation worse. Efforts should be made to mitigate mutual
distrust. Even the slightest careless action will increase that
distrust.

   Le Monde, Paris, on the political repercussions of the Iranian
earthquake:
   This catastrophe could strengthen the arguments of President
Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders who want to end as rapidly as
possible the isolation which has forced the country to turn toward
moderate Arab countries and the West,
   It remains to be seen if the door which has opened a crack under
these particularly sorrowful circumstances will close again when
the emotions provoked by the earthquake have faded. The
political-religious rhetoric, today relegated to secondary
importance, might surface again in the face of the complex problems
which must still be resolved in order to knock down the wall of
defiance and mistrust which 10 years of pure, rigid Khomeini-ism
has built around the Islamic Republic.

   A judge was sentenced today in his former
courtroom to two to five years in prison for bribery and corruption.
   Cambria County Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki, 59, was stripped of his
$80,000-per-year job and forfeits his state pension.
   Visiting Senior Judge Richard Grifo of Northampton County also
imposed a $57,500 fine on O'Kicki.
   ``You have tainted the entire judiciary with a broad brush,''
Grifo told O'Kicki. ``Every member of the judiciary not only feels
pain because of you, but will continue to feel that pain.''
   Before being sentenced, O'Kicki delivered a one-hour speech
accusing prosecutors of misconduct, criticizing local news media
and maintaining his innocence.
   ``I see conspiracies everywhere,'' O'Kicki said during the
speech, in which he quoted Isaac Newton, Latin philosophers and
former U.S. Supreme Court justices.
   Grifo allowed O'Kicki to remain free on bond pending his appeal,
which O'Kicki's attorneys said would be filed today.
   Last fall he was convicted of three counts of bribery and one
count each of official oppression, coercion and demanding money for
a promotion. O'Kicki faced a maximum sentence of 26 years in prison.
   Among other offenses, O'Kicki was convicted of bullying aides
and clerks into chopping wood, shuttling him to and from work,
feeding his dogs and performing other chores on county time.
   A secretary testified O'Kicki summoned her for dictation into
his chambers, where the judge was wearing only bikini underwear.
Another testified O'Kicki asked her to have sex with him at her
house before work, and treated her badly after she refused.

<HEAD>A New Plan for Play Production on Broadway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More plays and lower ticket prices are the goals
of a major new initiative to bring audiences back to Broadway.
   The plan to stimulate the production of plays in designated,
little-used Broadway theaters as well as to reduce ticket prices
was announced Tuesday by members of the Broadway theater community.
   The project, called The Broadway Alliance, was born after months
of discussion among theater owners, producers, unions and guilds,
said Harvey Sabinson, head of the League of American Theaters and
Producers.
   It involves salary, royalty and manpower reductions and
concessions by actors, producers, theater owners, unions and
suppliers, ``an equality of sacrifice,'' said Alan Eisenberg,
executive secretary of Actors Equity Association and committee
chairman of the Alliance.
   Because of these concessions, production costs for the plays
must not exceed $400,000, and producers must use certain,
underutilized Broadway theaters. That capitalization is less than
half of the usual $800,000 to $1 million now required to produce a
play on Broadway.
   In return, ticket prices will be held to a top price of $24 for
orchestra seats and $19 and $10 for mezzanine and balcony tickets.
The top ticket price for plays on Broadway now ranges from $37.50
for ``The Piano Lesson'' to $50 for ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and
``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   The plan is aimed at one-set plays with small casts and does not
apply to musicals.
   ``The Broadway community can no longer stand by as many of
America's finest plays are being produced everywhere but on
Broadway,'' said Peter Stone, head of the Dramatists Guild. ``Most
of these plays, in the face of growing costs and lacking a big
star, a major prize or a lavish production, have been relegated to
regional and off-Broadway theaters.
   ``Such acclaimed works as `Driving Miss Daisy,' `Steel
Magnolias,' `Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de lune,' `Other
People's Money' and `The Cocktail Hour' have achieved national
recognition and large motion picture contracts while Broadway can
only watch and remember a time, no more than 10 years ago, when
every one of these fine plays would have been lighting up Broadway
houses,'' Stone said.
   Broadway's three major theater owners _ the Shubert, Nederlander
and Jujamcyn organizations _ each have provided theaters for the
new project. The houses include the Walter Kerr, the Nederlander
and either the Belasco or Lyceum theaters. Only the Kerr is
currently booked. The theaters would be booked on a rotating basis.
   The plan will go into effect Sept. 1, and run for 18 months
until the end of February 1991, when it will be up for review.
Producers wishing to participate would have to apply to the
Alliance for approval.
   All personnel working at reduced wages, including the actors,
will participate in a profit-sharing plan after production costs
are recouped. The productions also will pay no rent to the theaters
until costs are recouped.

   The American Medical Association's policy-making
body defeated a measure to censor editorials in the AMA's medical
journal.
   The Illinois State Medical Society, angered by several
editorials in the Journal of the American Medical Association that
were critical of doctors, suggested a censorship panel to review
such material.
   But Tuesday, the House of Delegates overwhelmingly agreed that
the journal should continue to be editorially independent.
   ``By following a political agenda over a scientific one, we
would lose the respect of our contributors and, most importanly,
our readers,'' the journal's editor, Dr. George Lundberg said.
   Dr. James Andersen, president of the Illinois State Medical
Society, said the move to censor was prompted by frustation with
editorials that didn't reflect the views of the membership.
   ``We feel the editor should be responsible in some degree to the
journal's publisher and owner,'' Andersen said.

<TEXT>
   A West German businessman was
sentenced to five years in prison on Wednesday for helping Libya
build a plant the court said was ``clearly intended'' to produce
chemical weapons.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, described by prosecutors as a
``merchant of death,'' was found guilty by a state court in
Mannheim of violating West German export laws. He was also found
guilty on charges of tax evasion of $11.7 million. That charge was
based on his failure to report profits from the plant project.
   Chief Judge Juergen Henniger said that based on expert witness
testimony, the court concluded the plant in Rabta, 60 miles south
of Libya's capital of Tripoli, ``was clearly intended for the
production of chemical warfare agents.''
   He said the plant was capable of producing mustard gas and other
poison gases, and that Hippenstiel-Imhausen was aware of its
purpose before he signed a contract in 1984 to build it for Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Libya maintains the plant was intended to make pharmaceuticals
and insecticides, not chemical weapons.
   U.S. officials told West German authorities in late 1988 and
again in early 1989 that the plant was built to manufacture poison
gas, and an investigation against Hippenstiel-Imhausen and others
was opened last year.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen, 49, confessed on June 13 at his trial to
helping design, build and supply the facility, but he did not say
that he knew the plant was for poison gas. He apologized for
causing ``diplomatic problems'' for West Germany.
   The case was a major embarrassment for the West German
government, which initially denied West German firms were involved
in the project.
   As the verdict was read, the pale Hippenstiel-Imhausen often sat
with his head in his hands.
   Henninger sentenced Hippenstiel-Imhausen to the maximum three
years for violation of export laws, and four years for tax evasion,
then reduced it to a total of five years.
   He said he cut the sentence because the defendant had shown
remorse and confessed to his part in building the plant and to the
tax evasion charges.
   He will eligible for parole after serving two-thirds of his
sentence.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen's lawyer, Eberhard Wahle, said he was
``considering an appeal.''
   The ruling followed an 11-day hearing and marked one of the most
sensational business trials in West German history.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen was the director of the Imhausen-Chemie
company of Lahr in West Germany's southern Black Forest region.
   He testified that the Rabta project got its initial start in
1984 when a ``middleman'' contacted him about building a plant to
make ``pharmaceuticals and insecticides.'' He said he did not learn
until later that the plant would be built in Libya.
   He said that as head of Imhausen-Chemie he ``participated in
construction of the Rabta factory'' by delivering plans and
equipment for the project. Although he suspected he was violating
laws barring exports to areas of conflict, such as the Middle East,
Hippenstiel-Imhausen said he went on with the project because he
``didn't want to lose the business.''
   ``The responsibility and overall management were in my hands,''
he told the court.
   West German authorities are investigating 18 other people in
connection with the Rabta plant, but none has been charged.
   The Rabta plant was damaged by fire under mysterious
circumstances earlier this year, and there have been widespread
reports another plant in Libya is under construction.
   On Tuesday, the ARD television network, citing U.S. and West
German intelligence sources, said Libya intended to build a second
plant using the plans furnished by Hippenstiel-Imhausen for the
Rabta project.
   Libya on Wednesday denied a new chemical weapons plant is being
built.
   However, the Stuttgart prosecutor's office on Wednesday said it
was investigating an export company in Stuttgart in connection with
the alleged second plant, along with a computer and electronics
company in the city of Ulm.

   Sure, anyone can give someone the slip, but
actress Kathleen Turner's slip costs $1,200.
   The slip, which she has been wearing in the play ``Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,'' was one of 29 items sold Tuesday night at a black-tie
dinner and auction for Easter Seals. The auction raised $30,000 for
the charity that aids people with disabilities.
   Turner is playing Maggie in the play on Broadway, dressed in a
low-cut, lavender, thigh-length, silk slip with lace trim.
   Advertisements for the play feature Turner in the slip, seated,
with her legs crossed, leaning toward the camera but looking away,
and have appeared in newspapers, on billboards and posters in buses
and trains throughout the region.
   Bidding for the slip started at $500 and quickly grew after
auctioneer Diddi Lynn Worsole informed potential buyers that the
slip was not in the room because Turner was wearing it just a few
blocks away.
   ``She's sweating in it right now,'' Worsole said. ``Maybe there
will be a little perfume on it.''
   The bidding quickly escalated in increments of $100 until Staten
Island real estate broker Henry Setaro came in with the top bid of
$1,200.
   ``It's the closest I will ever get to Kathleen Turner,'' Setaro
said. ``I hope they don't wash it before I get it.''
   Setaro, whose wife sat next to him during the bidding, said he
might hang the slip up in his home, but he first wants to see how
his wife looks in it.
   ``I think my wife will look as good in it as Kathleen Turner,''
Setaro said.
   Sandy Setaro said she approved of the purchase because the money
was for a good cause.
   The slip is actually one of two that were custom-made for Turner
to wear in the Tennessee Williams play, in accordance with a union
regulation that says producers must provide two sets of each
costume.

<TEXT>
   Wanted: someone with a sense of history and humor
to plunk down a cool $1.225 million for a pleasure craft.
   Advertised in newspapers around the nation this week, the
opulent 83-foot yacht has a built-in Jacuzzi, three
rosewood-paneled staterooms and a requires a crew of six that can
handle intimate parties of 30-40 people.
   Elizabeth Taylor, Jack Nicholson, Elton John, Julio Iglesias and
James Caan have visited the three-decked Monkey Business at
Turnberry Isle, a ritzy resort complex north of Miami. But, of
course, its most famous passenger was Gary Hart.
   The former U.S. senator from Colorado fell from Democratic
front-runner for the presidency into infamy in less than a week
after his charter trip from Florida to Bimini with model Donna Rice
came to light in 1987.
   Hart and Rice swore there was no hanky-panky inside the swanky
master stateroom, which boasts a king-size bed.
   But Rice's girlfriend, a bikini store owner named Lynn Armandt
who was along for the ride, told the media otherwise and collected
a hefty fee in the meantime.
   The rest is tabloid and political history, says yacht broker Bob
Offer of Fort Lauderdale, who is selling the boat for Donald
Soffer, a millionaire developer with holdings in New York and Miami.
   ``The boat has a character of its own,'' said Offer. ``When you
walk on board, you really want to have a good time.''
   In fact, Hart wasn't even planning to leave the dock when he met
Rice, Armandt and his friend, William Broadhurst, a Washington,
D.C., attorney who had chartered the Monkey Business from Soffer
that day, Offer said.
   ``He went on board and the next thing he knew he was going to
the Bahamas,'' he said.
   Offer said Soffer, who had the Monkey Business custom-built in
1979 and first cast about for buyers last fall, decided to market
the boat in earnest because construction on a new 140-foot yacht is
almost complete.

   After the shrunken fiver comes the dime-sized
five-pence coin, and as usual when confronted with change, some
Britons are reacting with annoyance and suspicion.
   The tiny coin hit the streets Wednesday, exactly three weeks
after a smaller five-pound note was introduced to cries of derision.
   ``Are you kidding? These are ridiculous,'' said Parry Vaughn
when he was shown the new, shiny coins on a London street.
``They're too small, they're too fiddly, and as bad as the
five-pound note.''
   ``It's horrible. It's too small,'' said Valdo Cesar. But his
friend, Louis Leffa disagreed. ``It looks better. It's lighter and
easier,'' he said.
   ``They're small all right, like the old six-pence, but I would
get used to them,'' said Roger Brown, referring to the coinage of
pre-decimalization days.
   ``It doesn't surprise me that most people don't like it. This
government has a habit of doing things people don't like,'' said
Roger Levy.
   At the Royal Mint, spokesman Joseph Cussen sounded mildly
exasperated at the hostility that has greeted the new five-pence.
   ``The British are resistant to any change, and when it comes to
coins they can't bear with them being interfered with or changed,''
Cussen said.
   ``Nobody asked us,'' complained the tabloid Sun, to which the
Royal Mint responded with results of a 1987 survey in which most
people said they favored smaller, lighter coins.
   On the new five-pound note, Queen Elizabeth II has been updated
to show her age, 64.
   But she is unchanged on the new coin. The bust of Her Majesty
still turns up heads, and tails reveals the thistle badge of
Scotland.
   The government says the new coins contain less metal, saving
about $1.70 million a year. At .1 ounce each, they are nearly 50
percent lighter than their predecessors.
   The 5 billion larger five-pence coins still in circulation will
be phased out by Dec. 31 and recycled into new coins.
   ``The British don't like a new coin at first, but they get used
to it and then they protect it fiercely,'' Cussen said.
   He said the Royal Mint has never registered a flop like the
United States' Susan B. Anthony dollar coin.
   The closest shave, he said, was the coin that replaced the
10-shilling note in 1960.
   The shilling note ``was a little brown note which really made
you feel like you were spending money, and people were genuinely
heartbroken'' when it was phased out, he said. ``There was a move
in Parliament to have the coin withdrawn, but it wasn't
successful.''
   Since then, the pound has also become a coin.

   Environmentalists charge that the Bush
administration's plans to balance the interests of Northwest
loggers against survival of the northern spotted owl are an assault
on the Endangered Species Act.
   The administration Tuesday announced preliminary plans for
saving the owl by restricting logging.
   At the same time, the administration asked for relaxation of the
1973 Endangered Species Act to let policy-makers weigh the economic
and social costs against the benefits of saving animals that are
listed as threatened.
   ``They list the owl but now they're going to change the law so
they don't have to protect it,'' Larry Tuttle, Oregon director of
The Wilderness Society, said Tuesday.
   Andy Kerr, conservation director of the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said the proposals amounted to a ``Tiananmen Square for
American wildlife.''
   ``Opening up the Endangered Species Act is not a good idea in
the heat of the moment,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, timber industry supporters were skeptical the
government could make good on promises that enough timber would be
sold to keep loggers employed and lumber and plywood mills rolling.
   ``These proposals are a sham. They're smoke and mirrors,'' said
Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Friday the spotted owl,
of which 3,000 to 5,000 pairs remain, would be designated a
threatened species on July 23.
   Under law, that obligates the government to protect the owl,
which nests in the oldest and tallest trees of the Northwest _
timber prized by loggers.
   The preliminary plans to protect the owl were announced by
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan. A task force headed by Yeutter is to come up by Sept. 1 with
a detailed plan.
   The preliminary plan will reduce timber cutting on U.S. Bureau
of Land Management land in Oregon and Northern California from 950
million board feet annually to about 750 million. Lujan said 1,000
jobs would be lost over the next two year and 450 owls saved.
    An earlier proposal by government scientists would have
resulted in the loss of nearly 28,000 jobs on BLM and Forest
Service land over the next 10 years. Lujan said that by careful
cutting his proposal would protect 125 more pairs of owls than
would the scientists' proposal for BLM land.
   Yeutter and Lujan also called on Congress to broaden provisions
of the Endangered Species Act so that an exemption committee will
have more latitude to consider the economic and social impact of
protecting wildlife.
   Lujan said the BLM is determined to have a minimal impact on owl
habitat as it seeks maximum timber harvesting.
   ``We're not going to just go in there and cut willy, nilly. Any
contract submitted to us must meet the test of the Fish and
Wildlife Service. If we don't meet the test, we don't cut,'' he
said.

   The City Planning Commission on Wednesday
approved the construction of a $25 million biomedical laboratory on
the site where Malcolm X was slain, provided a substantial portion
of the building is preserved.
   That includes 40 percent of the Audubon Ballroom, including the
stage on which the black nationalist leader was shot o Feb. 21,
1965.
   In May, the commission had deferred a decision on a plan to
demolish the ballroom at Broadway and 165th Street, across from
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Followers of Malcolm X
objected.
   Applicants for the research building were Columbia University
and the city. It is to get funding from the Municipal Assistance
Corp. and state urban development aid.
   The project still has to be approved by the city's Board of
Estimate.
   Malcolm X headed the Harlem mosque of the Black Muslims but
split with Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad in 1963. Malcolm X
then formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity, which promoted
black nationalism but admitted the possibility of interracial
brotherhood.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Wednesday upholding federal policies that favor minorities
in awarding broadcast licenses:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, Main Opinion Written by Justice</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   William J. Brennan:
   It is of overriding significance in these cases that the FCC's
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved _
indeed, mandated _ by Congress.
   We hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress
_ even if those measures are not ``remedial'' in the sense of being
designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal
discrimination _ are constitutionally permissible to the extent
that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those
objectives.
   We hold that the FCC minority ownership policies pass muster...
First, we find that they serve the important governmental objective
of broadcast diversity. Second, we conclude that they are
substantially related to the achievement of that objective.
   We have long recognized that ``because of the scarcity of
(electromagnetic) frequencies, the government is permitted to put
restraints on licensees in favor of others whose views should be
expressed on this unique medium.''
   Just as a ``diverse student body'' contributing to a ``robust
exchange of ideas'' is a ``constitutionally permissible goal'' on
which a race-conscious university admissions program may be
predicated, the diversity of views and information on the airwaves
serves important First Amendment values.
   We do not believe that the minority ownership policies at issue
impose impermissible burdens on non-minorities. Although the
non-minority challengers in these cases concede that they have not
suffered the loss of an already-awarded broadcast license, they
claim that they have been handicapped in their ability to obtain
one in the first instance.
   But just as we have determined that ``as part of this nation's
dedication to eradicating racial discrimination, innocent persons
may be called upon to bear some of the burden of the remedy,'' we
similarly find that a congressionally mandated benign
race-conscious program that is substantially related to the
achievement of an important governmental interest is consistent
with equal protection principles so long as it does not impose
undue burdens on minorities.
   In the context of broadcasting licenses, the burden on
non-minorities is slight. The FCC's responsibility is to grant
licenses in the ``public interest, convenience or necessity'' and
the limited number of frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum
means that ``no one has a First Amendment right to a license.''
   Applicants have no settled expectation that their applications
will be granted without consideration of public interest factors
such as minority ownership.
   The commission's minority ownership policies bear the imprimatur
of longstanding congressional support and direction and are
substantially related to the achievement of the important
governmental objective of broadcast diversity. The judgment is
affirmed.

<HEAD>Dissenting Opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection
lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens
``as individuals, not `as simply components of a racial, religious,
sexual or national class.'''
   Social scientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior
reflect their background, but the Constitution provides that the
government may not allocate benefits and burdens among individuals
based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they
act or think.
   To uphold the challenged programs, the Court departs from these
fundamental principles and from our traditional requirement that
racial classifications are permissible only if necessary and
narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.
   This departure marks a renewed toleration of racial
classifications and a repudiation of our recent affirmation that
the Constitution's equal protection guarantees extend equally to
all citizens.
   The Court's application of a lessened equal protection standard
to congressional action finds no support in our cases or in the
Constitution.
   In both the challenged policies, the FCC provides benefits to
some members of our society and denies benefits to others based on
race or ethnicity.
   Except in the narrowest of circumstances, the Constitution bars
such racial classifications as a denial to particular individuals,
of any race or ethnicity, of the equal protection of the laws.
   The dangers of such classifications are clear. They endorse
race-based reasoning and the conception of a nation divided into
racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial
hostility and conflict.
   We are a nation not of black and white alone, but one teeming
with divergent communities knitted together by various traditions
and carried forth, above all, by individuals. Upon that basis, we
are governed by one Constitution, providing a single guarantee of
equal protection, one that extends equally to all citizens.
   Under the appropriate standard, strict scrutiny, only a
compelling interest may support the government's use of racial
classifications.
   Modern equal protection doctrine has recognized only one such
interest: remedying the effects of racial discrimination. The
interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is
clearly not a compelling interest. It is simply too amorphous, too
insubstantial, and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for
employing racial classifications.
   The court has determine, in essence, that Congress and all
federal agencies are exempted, to some ill-defined but significant,
degree, from the Constitution's equal protection requirements. This
break with our precedents greatly undermines equal protection
guarantees, and permits distinctions among citizens based on race
and ethnicity with the Constitution clearly forbids.

<TEXT>
   A Cuban refugee wanted for questioning in the
shooting death of an FBI agent has been arrested in Mexico, police
said today.
   Jose Antonio Echevarria, 29, was arrested Tuesday night after
authorities tracked him throughout the day, said Las Vegas police
Lt. Kyle Edwards.
   Echevarria was arrested without resistance at the Ciudad Juarez
airport by Mexican police, said Terry Kincaid, an FBI agent in El
Paso, Texas, just across the U.S. border from Juarez.
   ``We've got a federal hold on him on a bank robbery charge,''
Edwards said.
   Echevarria had been sought since Monday, when FBI agent John
Bailey was gunned down as he tried to halt a robbery at a Security
Pacific Bank branch several blocks east of the Las Vegas Strip.
   Carlos Guerri Rubio, 27, originally identified by police as
Gurry, was arrested on a murder warrant two hours after Bailey died.
   Police had emphasized Monday and Tuesday that Echevarria was
wanted only for questioning and was not a suspect in the killing.
Edwards hedged on that statement following Echevarria's arrest.
   ``We've obtained a lot of information since last night as to the
activity of both suspects the day of the robbery,'' Edwards said
today. He would not elaborate.
   Edwards said police received information Tuesday that Echevarria
was in Mexico.
   Bailey, 47, was shot and killed when he happened on the robbery
while serving a subpoena at the bank.
   A motorcycle belonging to Echevarria was found in front of the
bank.
   Echevarria, who fled from Cuba to Florida on an inner tube raft
in 1987, was Guerri's roommate.
   Edwards said Bailey was clutching personal papers belonging to
Guerri following Monday's shooting.
   Police first said Bailey had a robbery suspect on the bank
floor, then was knocked against a wall before he was shot. On
Tuesday they said Bailey confronted the robber and managed to sit
him down in a chair in the lobby.
   The agent asked a bank teller to get a pair of handcuffs from
his car and was in the process of going through the suspect's
billfold for identification when the robber reached for a gun and
fired, hitting Bailey three times in the body and arms, police said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge climbed 0.8 percent to a new high in May, the government
reported Wednesday in a new sign the nation's longest peacetime
expansion will last at least through the end of its seventh year.
   However, the report also pointed to a sobering new dropoff in
consumer confidence, and one analyst said the economy ``could be
close to a recession by the end of the year.''
   The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months ahead, rose to 146.2 percent of its 1982 base. The previous
record of 146.0 was set in January 1989.
   But analysts attributed the improvement mainly to overseas
demand for U.S. products and said U.S. consumer spending remains
weak. Some suggested that because of consumer restraint, economic
growth could slow further in the months ahead.
   Indeed, the largest negative in the report was an index
measuring consumer confidence, which fell back from a slim advance
in April. It also had been negative in January and February and
unchanged in March.
   Other recent Commerce Department reports and a national survey
earlier this month by the Federal Reserve also point to a slowdown
in consumer spending which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   ``Consumers are getting to be a lot more cautious than they have
been,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York. ``The main reason they're retrenching
is they are weighed down by the debt they piled up during the
1980s.''
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New
York government securities firm, also said consumers also are
beginning to worry about their job outlook and ``a constant
barrage'' of unfavorable economic news.
   But analysts said exports appear to be picking up the slack,
stimulating the manufacturing sector which has been sluggish for
months. Overall, the economy grew at only a 1.1 percent annual rate
in the last quarter of 1989 and just a 1.3 percent rate in the
first three months of this year, though that was enough to keep
alive the expansion that began in November 1982.
   ``The May leading indicators show that except for housing and
construction, the production side of the economy is beginning to
recover,'' said William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Steinberg agreed, but said: ``It's principally the export
industries that are doing well right now. And that's principally
the high technology companies like computers, and the aircraft
industry.''
   And Jones questioned whether economic growth could continue
without a strong consumer contribution. Without it, he said, ``the
economy could be close to a recession by the end of the year.''
   A consensus forecast of prominent economists surveyed earlier
this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., is
for 1990 growth of just 1.9 percent, down from 3 percent last year
and 4.4 percent in 1988.
   Nevertheless, any growth at all would be welcome news for White
House and congressional leaders who resumed negotiations Wednesday
on reducing the federal deficit in fiscal 1991.
   A recession would make their task much more difficult since it
would mean a loss of jobs and incomes, diminished corporate profits
and a drop in tax revenues. At the same time, the government would
be called upon to increase spending on various benefits.
   Seven of the 11 leading indicators were positive in May _ a
longer average workweek, an increase in the price of raw materials,
a larger amount of orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices,
a decrease in the weekly unemployment claims, slower business
delivery times and an increase in orders for new plants and
equipment.
   In addition to the drop in consumer confidence, the other
negatives were a decrease in the money supply, a smaller number of
building permits and a drop in manufacturers' unfilled orders.

   A man who said he escaped a rampaging mob of
youths the night a young woman jogger was gang-raped and left for
dead in Central Park testified today that he recognized a shirt
worn by one of the suspects.
   It was the first time during the trial of three youths charged
in the attack that a witness provided any link to any of the
defendants.
   The three are charged with rape and attempted murder, based in
part on admissions they made to police after arrest. On Tuesday the
judge said he would not let defense lawyers introduce IQ tests and
psychological evidence suggesting that their teen-age clients
confessed to crimes they didn't commit.
   The witness, Gerald Malone, was shown a photograph of several
youths on Tuesday by an attorney for defendant Raymond Santana. The
picture was taken after the young men were arrested in the case.
   Malone failed to identify any of the youths by face but under
questioning by Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer told
jurors he recognized the shirt, which had a large white logo, worn
by one of the teen-agers.
   The shirt was being worn by Keith Richardson, one of three
additional defendants in the case who will stand trial later this
year.
   Malone said the shirt was ``similar'' to the one he saw on one
of the youths who tried to attack him as he and his fiance were
riding a tandem bike through the park.
   On Tuesday, Justice Thomas Galligan of the state Supreme Court,
New York's trial-level court, refused to admit reports from
psychologists who examined defendants Antron McCray, 15, Santana,
16, and Yusef Salaam, 16.
   During jury selection, each defense lawyer suggested that his
client had succumbed to lies, trickery and intimidation, and one
alluded to how prisoners of war confess to things of which they are
not guilty.
   ``Some people have a tendency to act under pressure,'' said
Michael Joseph, McCray's lawyer.
   ``I felt it was important for the jury to know how my client
scored on his intelligence tests, his IQ,'' Joseph said. ``On the
one end you have an Alan Dershowitz, and on the other end you have
my client. He's no Dershowitz.''
   Dershowitz is a Harvard law professor and eminent defense
attorney.
   The teen-agers allegedly were part of a larger gang of youths
who rampaged through Central Park, randomly assaulting or trying to
assault at least eight people they encountered.
   A witness testified Tuesday that he and his fiancee narrowly
escaped that night from a mob of 30 or 40 teen-agers _ the same
group prosecutors say attacked the jogger about 30 minutes later.
   The jogger, an investment banker who was then 28, was
gang-raped, beaten, and left for dead in a puddle of mud and blood.
   She suffered brain damage and cannot recall what happened to her
that night, Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer told the
jury.
   Malone, 35, an advertising executive, testified that he and his
fiancee, Patricia Dean, were riding a tandem bicycle in the park
that night when they spotted the mob.
   ``They were spread out over the road, and they were making
noise. They were making grunting sounds, yelling,'' he said.
   Malone said he and Dean pedaled quickly through the group and
escaped, then called police. Malone said he was unable to recognize
any of the gang members.
   The youths are being tried in an adult court, but if convicted
face sentencing as juveniles to up to 10 years in prison.
   Three other teen-agers face trial on the same charges later this
year.

   The emir of Kuwait has canceled ceremonies marking
the Moslem Eid al-Adha feast in deference to the victims of the
Iranian earthquake, an official announcement said Wednesday.
   ``In sympathy with the plight of the Moslem people of
neighboring Iran following the disastrous earthquake which claimed
thousand of victims, the Emiri Court announces that the emir will
not receive well-wishers as usual for Eid al-Adha,'' said the
announcement.
   Each year, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, like leaders in the
rest of the conservative countries on the Arabian Peninsula, marks
Eid al-Adha by receiving long lines of well-wishes at his palace.
   Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, falls Monday and
commemorates the Prophet Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son
to God.
   Sheik Jaber's gesture follows the improvement in Kuwaiti
relations with Iran since the end of the Iran-Iraq war. During the
eight-year war, Kuwait was the target of Iranian missile and ship
attacks because Iran accused it of supporting Iraq.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, was in serious condition Wednesday as she
battled hepatitis infecting her second transplanted liver.
   Stormie, 13, of White Settlement, Texas, had been listed in fair
condition when she was admitted Saturday to Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh for testing. Her condition was downgraded Tuesday when
doctors said tests confirmed she had hepatitis.
   Stormie received injections Wednesday to fight the hepatitis,
and doctors slightly reduced her anti-rejection medication to
enable her body to combat the infection, said hospital spokeswoman
Sue Cardillo.
   Ms. Cardillo said doctors were ``fairly optimistic'' they could
fight the infection with medication.
   ``Stormie looks good. She feels good. She doesn't like getting
shots, but otherwise she's doing fine,'' she said.
   Infectious hepatitis, a viral infection that inflames the liver,
had damaged her first transplanted liver. It was replaced in
February.
   Last month, Stormie suffered mild liver rejection and returned
to Pittsburgh for tests. Doctors then also adjusted the dosage of
her anti-rejection medication.
   On Feb. 14, 1984, Stormie became the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient during an operation at Children's Hospital.

   the making of a statement are the best indicators of reliability, I
doubt this is so in every instance. And if it were true in a
particular case, that does not warrant ignoring other indicators of
reliability such as corroborating evidence, absent some other
reason for excluding it.
   In this case, the younger daughter's statements are corroborated
(by other evidence). These facts, coupled with the circumstances
surrounding the making of the statements acknowledged by the court
as suggesting that the statements are reliable, give rise to a
legitimate argument that admission of the statements did not

<HEAD>High Court Rules Post Offices May Ban Soliciting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prohibiting people from soliciting on Post
Office property does not violate their right of free speech, the
Supreme Court said Wednesday.
   The justices voted 5-4 to reinstate the convictions of two
political activists who solicited contributions and handed out
literature on a sidewalk at the Bowie, Md., post office in 1986.
   ``We are grateful the Supreme Court has recognized our
customers' need for unimpeded access to do business with the Postal
Service,'' said post office general counsel Harold Hughes.
   ``The history of regulation of solicitation in post offices
demonstrates the reasonableness of the provision here at issue,''
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the court's main opinion.
   O'Connor, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron
R. White and Antonin Scalia said a sidewalk on post office property
is not a traditional public forum where free-speech rights are
given enhanced protection.
   Providing the key fifth vote, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said
there was no need to reach that issue because the disputed
regulation is a valid one restricting the time, place or manner of
speech _ not its content.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented, saying such a sidewalk is
a traditional public forum and that the postal regulation is being
enforced in a discriminatory way.
   Marsha Kokinda and Kevin Pearl were arrested outside the Bowie
post office Aug. 6, 1986, after they refused to stop their
activities from a table they had set up on a sidewalk adjacent to
the building.
   The two are volunteers for the National Democratic Policy
Committee, the political arm of an organization headed by political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   They were convicted of violating a federal regulation banning
``soliciting, electioneering, collecting debts, vending and
advertising'' on postal property.
   Although there was no evidence the two had blocked or interfered
with people entering or leaving the post office, postal officials
had received about 40 complaints before asking Ms. Kokinda and
Pearl to leave.
   The post office in Bowie, like tens of thousands in suburban and
rural communities, is a freestanding building with its own sidewalk
and parking lot. A municipal sidewalk runs in front of the post
office property, separating the parking lot from the street.
   When the case was argued before the high court in February, a
Justice Department lawyer drew a distinction between municipal
sidewalks _ where free-speech rights traditionally have broad
protections _ and sidewalks on federal property.
   The court today agreed with that distinction.
   Justice Department lawyer John Roberts Jr. last February also
reported that the regulation is not being enforced against people
who hand out leaflets or those who picket, but only against those
who solicit immediate contributions.
   The case is U.S. vs. Kokinda, 88-2031.

<HEAD>China Buys More U.S. Wheat Under Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 139,400 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said six private exporting companies
made the deals under USDA's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for October, he said.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized to be sold to
China under EEP on May 2. Previous allocations had been exhausted
except for 5,050 tons. Dickerson said China has slightly more than
1 million tons remaining in its current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about els. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $3.21 a bushel, the
wheat would have a farm5.1 million bush value of around $16 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $19.82 a ton, or
about 54 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by: Continental Grain Co.,
74,400 bushels; Central States Enterpribt they piled up during the
1980s.''
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New
York government securities firm, also said consumers also are
beginning to worry about their job outlook and ``a constant
barrage'' of unfavorable economic news.
   But analysts said exports appear to be picking up the slack,
stimulating the manufacturing sector which has been sluggish for
months. Overall, the economy grew at only a 1.1 percent annual rate
in the last quarter of 1989 and just a 1.3 percent rate in the
first three months of this year, though that was enough to keep
alive the expansion that began in November 1982.
   ``The May leading indicators show that except for housing and
construction, the production side of the economy is beginning to
recover,'' said William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Steinberg agreed, but said: ``It's principally the export
industries that are doing well right now. And that's principally
the high technology companies like computers, and the aircraft
industry.''
   And Jones questioned whether economic growth could continue
without a strong consumer contribution. Without it, he said, ``the
economy could be close to a recession by the end of the year.''
   A consensus forecast of prominent economists surveyed earlier
this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., is
for 1990 growth of just 1.9 percent, down from 3 percent last year
and 4.4 percent in 1988.
   Nevertheless, any growth at all would be welcome news for White
House and congressional leaders who resumed negotiations Wednesday

   A recession would make their task much more difficult since it

   Seven of the 11 leading indicators were positive in May _ a

a larger amount of orders for consumer goods, higher stock prices,
a decrease in the weekly unemployment claims, slower business
delivery times and an increase in orders for new plants and
equipment.
   In addition to the drop in consumer confidence, the other
negatives were a decrease in the money supply, a smaller number of
building permits and a drop in manufacturers' unfilled orders.

   The Yorktown, a World War II aircraft carrier, is the
centerpiece of the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum.
   A group of retired Navy and Marine Corps officers asked Hope to
participate in the fund-raiser because the museum is having
financial problems.
   The carrier, launched in 1943, was in many World War II and
Vietnam War battles. It also recovered the crew of Apollo 8, the
first manned spacecraft to circle the moon, in 1968. The ship has
been docked in Mount Pleasant, a Charleston suburb, since 1975.

   Singer Dionne Warwick says AIDS education
campaigns must target minorities, and in words that are
understandable to those who don't have a high school diploma.
   The Grammy-winning singer told an international AIDS and ethics
forum Tuesday that health officials have reached the educated
white, gay male population.
   ``We must develop new models that are culturally sensitive and
community-specific,'' Warwick said in calling for ``bilingual''
AIDS educators who also know the language of the streets.
   ``Having our health decisions made by Caucasian males, while it
has never been satisfactory, is no longer acceptable,'' said
Warwick.
   Warwick and pop music stars Stevie Wonder, Elton John and Gladys
Knight raised $2 million for AIDS research with their recording,
``That's What Friends Are For.'' But the singer said she was
dissatisfied with how little ended up in the hands of minorities
``because they didn't have a voice.''
   She has since established the Warwick Foundation to raise funds
for minority AIDS programs.

<TEXT>
   Little relief was forecast today as America's
hottest city got hotter than ever _ 122 degrees _ overheating cars
and preventing planes from taking off safely.
   The same heat wave sent the temperature to 112 Tuesday in Los
Angeles, also an all-time record.
   ``This is going to finish up the strawberries,'' said Ben
Hillbrecht, a grower near Escondido, Calif. ``And the boysenberries
will cook right on the vine.''
   Authorities said they suspected three deaths in Phoenix and one
in Los Angeles were heat-related.
   In Tonto National Forest, 90 miles northeast of Phoenix, six
firefighters were killed and five injured Tuesday while fighting a
1,900-acre wildfire. It was not immediately known if the heat
played a role in the tragedy. The temperature topped 106 in Payson,
12 miles from the fire area.
   Electricity use in Los Angeles skyrocketed to an all-time high
along with the mercury, as residents attempted to quell the
scorching heat with air conditioners, the city's Department of
Water and Power reported. The demand topped 5,000-megawatts passing
the 4,991-megawatt mark of Sept. 6, 1988.
   The National Weather Service predicted it would be just about as
hot today in the Southwest. Only slight cooling was expected by the
weekend as a high-pressure system held fast over New Mexico,
Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
   Tuesday's high in Phoenix broke a day-old record. Monday's high
of 120 surpassed the old record of 118, equaled most recently on
July 4, 1989.
   The city's normal high for June 26 is 105. This morning's low
fell only to 93 degrees, and the weather service expected the
116-degree record high for this date to be easily broken.
   During the worst of the heat, jetliners were grounded at Sky
Harbor Airport because the manuals that specify takeoff speeds and
maximum loads at different temperatures stop at 120 degrees. No one
contemplated jetliners encountering higher temperatures at major
airports, airport spokesman Rick Martinez said.
   America West and Southwest airlines, the airport's major
carriers, contacted the Boeing Corp. in Seattle for emergency
charts to use in takeoffs of Boeing 737-200s, their most widely
used airliner, and Boeing engineers worked out the new
specifications, he said.
   Martinez said the heat reduced lift for all aircraft.
   ``The hotter it is, the tougher it is for a jet to take off,''
Martinez said.
   Phoenix natives pride themselves on their resistance to heat,
but out-of-towners were shocked by the scorching weather.
   Emery Jones of Castledale, Utah, drove into town with his wife,
Suzanne, in an air-conditioned car. When they stepped out, he said,
``it took our breath away.''
   ``We're buried,'' said David Wonnacott, general manager of
services and installation for Goettl Air Conditioning. ``There are
more calls than we can handle.''
   Charlie Blackburn, owner of Sun City Auto Service, said his shop
was ``super busy'' servicing automobile air conditioners, replacing
radiators and making other heat-related repairs.
   ``Unfortunately when it's the hottest, we have to work the
hardest,'' he said.
   Fire Department spokesman Steven Jensen said the heat was
suspected in the deaths of three men _ one whose body was found in
his home Tuesday after he called a doctor Monday night to complain
of symptoms of heat exhaustion, another found behind a downtown
building, and a third found on a street.
   In Los Angeles today, the downtown early morning low dipped to
84 about 5 a.m. That would tie the all-time record warmest low, set
in September 1939, if the temperature remains above 84 through
midnight tonight, according to the National Weather Service.
   Police said a 4-year-old boy died after he got inside a car
parked out of the shade with the windows rolled up.
   Tuesday's 112-degree high in Los Angeles broke the record of 110
degrees set Sept. 4, 1988.
   Southern Californians streamed to beaches, where temperatures
were more than 20 degrees lower than inland. Lifeguards reported
nearly 100,000 people at Santa Monica, 150,000 at Hermosa Beach and
40,000 at Zuma Beach.
   ``This is our season,'' laughed Marilyn Novak, marketing
director for Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores. ``These will be
record-breaking days for our stores, believe me,'' she said from
company headquarters in Glendale, Calif.

<HEAD>Warrant Issued for Arrest of Officer Accused of Cover-Up in Jesuit
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrest warrant was issued
today for an army officer accused of destroying evidence in the
November massacre of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her
teen-age daughter.
   The warrant for Lt. Col. Carlos Camilo Hernandez was issued by
Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is handling the politically-charged
investigation.
   The charges accuse Camilo Hernandez of destroying the mission
logs of troops accused of the shooting. Camilo, now an executive
officer of the elite Belloso Battalion in the capital, is the
former assistant director of the military college where the troops
were stationed.
   The director of the college, Col. Guilllermo Benavides, three
lieutenants and five enlisted men have already been charged with
the murders.
   The massacre took place during a large-scale offensive by
leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN. Army positions at the college had come under fire several
times.
   Six priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter were
roused from their sleep before dawn on Nov. 16 and killed by troops
of the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion. Two of three lieutenants
leading the death squad said Benavides issued a direct order to
kill the priests.
   The investigation has moved slowly and there have been reports
that crucial evidence has been destroyed, that military witnesses
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying and
that the masterminds of the slayings were being protected.
   The far right considered the left-leaning Jesuit academics
subversive because they blamed social injustice, rather than
international Communist expansion, for El Salvador's 10-year-old
revolution.

<HEAD>Experimental Muscular Dystrophy Treatment Held to be Feasible,

   Researchers who injected millions of immature
muscle cells into muscular dystrophy patients said Wednesday the
experimental treatment has proven safe and feasible.
   The injections went into the biceps, making the new work the
first to show safety and feasibility for treating a large muscle,
the Muscular Dystrophy Association said.
   But Dr. George Karpati of the Montreal Neurological Institute
said it will take months to find out whether the experimental
therapy succeds in improving muscle strength.
   Karpati, who led the research team, spoke in a telephone
interview before announcing results at a news conference.
   The experimental procedure is aimed at Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, a genetic muscle-destroying disease that disables in
childhood and usually kills in young adulthood from destruction of
respiratory muscles.
   In the treatment, immature muscle cells called myoblasts are
injected into a patient's muscle. The hope is that the myoblasts
will supply muscle fibers with a gene to produce dystrophin, a
protein the fibers lack. Loss of this protein leads to the disease.
   Earlier this month, researchers said the procedure spurred
dystrophin production in a patient's big toe.
   Karpati said the new experiment was on a larger scale, involving
50 to 60 injections into a larger muscle, and delivering 60 million
myoblasts throughout each treated bicep.
   One patient was treated in April and two others later, Karpati
said. The boys are ages 6 and 8.
   The myoblasts were generated from muscle samples, no bigger than
a pencil eraser, taken from the boys' fathers, he said.

   Minority broadcasters said Wednesday's Supreme
Court decision upholding the Federal Communications Commission's
affirmative action rules will spur efforts to increase minority
ownership of radio and TV stations.
   James L. Winston, executive director of the National Association
of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said the decision ``means the FCC's
ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward
without fear of constitutional challenge.
   ``While this still ... is not at the level we would like to see,
we are pleased that the ability of the FCC to utilize policies to
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand.''
   Before the FCC established the rules in 1978, blacks owned about
30 radio stations and one television station, according to the
National Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters. Now, blacks own
182 radio stations and 17 television stations, the group said
Wednesday.
   That represents an increase from 1 percent to about 3.5 percent
of the nation's radio and TV stations, the FCC said.
   Those numbers are likely to grow now that the legal
uncertainties have been lifted from the rules, broadcasters said.
   Eddie Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the decision ``affirms the FCC's ability to
improve the under-representation of minorities in broadcast
ownership.''
   Lois Wright, vice president and corporate counsel for one of the
nation's largest black-owned broadcasting companies, Inner City
Broadcasting Corp. in New York City, said the FCC rules have been
working effectively and ``I think they'll work more effectively
now. ... You're likely to get more deals'' involving minority
broadcasters.
   The rules upheld Wednesday award preference to minorities
seeking broadcast licenses. The FCC ``comparative'' licensing
process also gives preference to competing applicants based on
other factors, such as whether prospective owners plan to operate
the station. Female applicants also receive extra points, but the
court said it was not ruling on gender preference.
   The court Wednesday also upheld separate rules, known as the
``distress sale'' policy, that allow a broadcaster faced with the
loss of his license to sell to a minority-owned business at 75
percent of a station's market value.
   ``I'm overjoyed,'' said Kernie Anderson, general manager of
WDAS-AM-FM in Philadelphia. ``This reflects a continuation of a
policy that has benefited not only African-Americans but women and
the entire nation. It has made for greater diversity in our
industry,'' Anderson said.
   ``For the Supreme Court to uphold the righteousness of what
indeed was a just action by the commission ... is appreciated by an
African-American,'' Anderson said.
   WDAS was one of the first stations sold under the distress sale
policy.
   FCC policy also allows anyone who sells a radio or TV station or
cable system to defer capital gains taxes on the sale if the buyer
is a member of a minority. This so-called tax certificate policy
was not in question Wednesday at the court.

   Czechoslovakia's internal security agency tested
Semtex on a passenger aircraft in 1984 and found that just seven
ounces of the explosive could destroy a plane in flight, according
to a British television documentary.
   Semtex has been implicated in the destruction of Pan Am Flight
103 in December 1988, in which 270 people died.
   The hour-long ``This Week'' documentary for Thames Television,
scheduled for broadcast Thursday night, shows spectacular
explosions filmed by the former marketing director at the factory
that produced Semtex.
   The tests in October and November of 1984 were an anti-terrorist
exercise, said Maj. Zbynek Hybl, identified as a member of the
parliamentary ``special operations group'' allied with the
Czechoslovak secret police.
   Hybl said only four other people were involved in the tests,
which were conducted on a Soviet-built Ilyushin 18. He said the
results were not passed to any terrorist group.
   Paul Wilkinson, professor of international relations at St.
Andrews University in Scotland and an expert on terrorism, said in
a telephone interview that Czechoslovakia had no need for an
anti-terrorist program.
   ``There was never a terrorist threat within Czechoslovakia's
borders, nor had a Czech aircraft ever been threatened by attack
with a sabotage bomb,'' Wilkinson said.
   Czechoslovakia's previous communist government ``had a
reputation for passing on specialized knowledge not only to their
own operatives, but on a very selective basis to chosen proxies and
clients, which I assume _ and I think most students of the subject
assume _ had to be approved at a very high level, with the
knowledge and consent of the KGB,'' he said.
   Semtex is made only in Czechoslovakia, and President Vaclav
Havel has confirmed that the previous Communist regime sold nearly
1,000 tons of it to the government of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   The documentary says Hybl's ``special operations group'' was
based in Brezany Castle, near Prague, where the Interior Ministry
also had a training program for Third World security agents.
   ``We wanted to find out what strength of charge you would need
to blow a hole through the fuselage of the plane,'' said Hybl,
whose remarks were translated by Thames Television.
   ``That was the most important piece of information we needed. We
tried every explosive we could get hold of, everything from
military to civilian...
   ``As far as the Czechoslovakian explosives we had were
concerned, we discovered that a charge weighing 200 grams (seven
ounces) would be more than enough to blow a hole in the fuselage
which would be large enough to cause the plane to decompress in
flight.''
   Those tests produced jagged holes about the size of a dinner
plate in the plane.
   Scottish police have said Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747, was
destroyed by a small amount of explosive hidden in a radio-cassette
player.
   The documentary shows 8mm color film taken by Bohumile Sole, who
said he retired last year as the Semtex factory's marketing
director.
   ``They said they wanted me to teach them how to work with Semtex
because they had not worked with Semtex before,'' Sole said.
   ``They didn't even know how to design a charge. So, they simply
wanted to know how effective Semtex was, what its characteristics
were, when it was applied to various parts of the aircraft.''
   Wilkinson said much is still unknown about the assistance that
Communist governments gave terrorist groups.
   Hungarian Interior Minister Balazs Horvath said Tuesday that the
former Communist leadership had sheltered Ilich Ramirez Sanchez,
the terrorist known as Carlos who organized an attack on OPEC
headquarters in Vienna in 1975. Former Interior Minister Andras
Benkei described the charge as ``nonsense.''
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel has said
former Communist leader Erich Honecker and his security chief made
hospitality to West German terrorists a ``personal hobby.''
   Information provided by a former high-ranking East German secret
police officer recently has led to the arrest of nine suspected
members of the Red Army Faction.

   Foreign commentators on Wednesday welcomed
President Bush's concession on tax increases but expressed
skepticism that the huge U.S. budget deficit would be reduced
substantially.
   Financial markets had a mixed and slightly nervous reaction. The
dollar fell against other major currencies around the globe. Stock
prices soared in Tokyo, and European stock markets shrugged off the
news.
   Abandoning his ``read-my-lips: no-new-taxes'' campaign pledge,
Bush on Tuesday conceded that higher taxes would be required to get
the deficit under control. The White House would not specify any
tax increases or program cuts.
   The U.S. deficit could total more than $200 billion in the next
fiscal year.
   U.S. trading partners for years have clamored for the United
States to cut its red ink, which pushes U.S. interest rates higher.
That puts upward pressure on foreign interest rates. High rates
anywhere slow economic growth.
   ``At economic summit after economic summit we have consistently
called for imbalances to be corrected,'' a British government
official said on condition of anonymity. ``I would have thought
that he (Bush) would get more accolades from abroad than at home.''
   The news was prominently displayed in the foreign press.
   Under the headline ``Read My Lips (Again),'' The Times of London
editorialized: ``Given the stake held by the rest of the world in
the orderly cutting of a deficit that is plainly out of control, a
sigh of relief is called for.''
   Some newspapers couldn't resist a dig.
   The financial page of Amsterdam's De Volkskrant newspaper
cynically wrote the top of its lead story like a fairy tale: ``Once
upon a time he told the American people he would resist with all
his might any increase in taxes.''
   The Milan daily Corriere della Sera's headline said in part:
``To Contain the Deficit, He Has to Eat His Words.''
   The dollar fell on the prospect that tax increases would lower
U.S. interest rates.
   Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank in Tokyo, said: ``Japanese
investors now think the U.S. monetary policy is moving toward
relaxation.''
   A trader in Milan said: ``We're seeing small, nervous movements,
but no big swings. The Europeans are going to let the United States
decide in which direction to send the dollar.''
   Ian Francis, a director at Morgan Grenfell and Co. in London,
said the foreign exchange market might have overreacted. The U.S.
Federal Reserve Board is unlikely to do an about-face on its tight
monetary stand on the basis of Bush's turnaround, he said.
   Meanwhile, the news helped send the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, soaring 740.98 points,
or 2.29 percent, to close at 32,312.75.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 26.3 points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,373.5. Traders mostly
cited concern about weakness in the stock index futures market.
   But traders also said there was concern that Bush's statement
would lead to a lower dollar, which in turn could hurt the profits
of dollar-earning companies.
   The Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan and Paris stock markets showed
little reaction.
   Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel
and Co. in London, said he expects the Bush administration to leave
income taxes alone, and instead raise tobacco and alcohol duties.
But that won't be enough, he said.
   ``When this comes down to it, we will still be faced with a huge
budget cutting task,'' Dennis said.
   The Times of London concluded that Bush must resist a renewed
urge to spend.
   ``He should do so with all the political strength he has:
economic stability across the world depends on it,'' the Times said.

   Despite the rise of conservative foes, a top
official said Wednesday it is unlikely next week's pivotal
gathering of Soviet Communists will be postponed or will turn
against Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, the party's ideology chief and member of its
Politburo, also said the platform and rules that the party
leadership will propose to the congress have been reworked in
response to criticism from both left and right.
   In the new documents, the party takes a repentant tone about its
blame for the country's ills.
   Medvedev's comments, and the revisions of the main congress
documents just four days before the 4,700 delegates converge on
Moscow, showed the leadership's deep concern about keeping the
party together. Reformers say conservative foes of Gorbachev could
dominate the gathering, undermine him as he tries to pull the
country out of a deep economic and political crisis, and force
progressives to quit the party.
   The reform-minded president of the Russian republic, Boris N.
Yeltsin, urged Tuesday that the 28th Communist Party Congress be
postponed until autumn to ``stabilize the political situation.''
   Medvedev said other Communist officials also want to delay the
congress, now scheduled to start Monday, because there have been
too many political meetings lately. But he said a delay was
unlikely.
   ``I believe the train has already left the station, and we
should stick to the original date,'' he told a news conference. He
added that the leadership had contacted delegates across the
nation, and most oppose a delay.
   The issue is expected to come up Friday at a meeting of the
party's 249-member policy-making Central Committee. That body will
review the timing of the congress and discuss the main congress
documents, Medvedev said.
   Yeltsin has predicted ``a real struggle'' at the Central
Committee meeting over the congress timing.
   A postponement could prevent hard-liners from capitalizing on
their successes last week at a meeting of party members from the
Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic.
   Some traditional-minded Soviet Communists demand the resignation
of Gorbachev, who holds the posts of Soviet president and general
secretary of the Communist Party, but occupies a shrinking middle
ground in Soviet politics.
   But Medvedev told reporters he was confident that supporters of
Gorbachev's perestroika, or reform program, would gain the upper
hand.
   ``We expect healthy perestroika forces to take care of that. ...
I am convinced those forces are in the majority,'' he said.
   He declined to predict how Gorbachev would fare if his most
prominent conservative foe, Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, ran
against him for party chief at the congress.
   Under draft rules that may be changed in a revision to be
published Thursday, the congress would be urged to eliminate the
position of party general secretary, the post Gorbachev now holds,
and replace it with a chairman.
   It also would elect a new Central Committee and could be called
upon to replace the 12-man Politburo with a larger, more
representative body.
   Despite uncertainty surrounding the congress, the Central
Committee published a ``program statement'' Wednesday that the
congress will be asked to approve. Medvedev said the party's
positions, originally published in February, were revised after
consultations with representatives of the Democratic Platform and
Marxist Platform, progressive and conservative groups, respectively.
   The program, spread across almost two pages of the Communist
Party daily Pravda, pays tribute to Communist idols Marx, Lenin and
Engels, but not Marxism-Leninism, the way of thinking long at the
basis of Soviet ideology.
   It emphasizes instead that good ideas should be drawn from all
currents of thought.
   The Soviet Union's main problem, it says, is the previous
distortion of socialism.
   ``False ideas about socialism as a society based on the state
monopoly on property, and dictatorship led by the party-state brass
in the name of the proletariat, led to tyranny and lawlessness and
the alienation of people from property and authority,'' the
committee said.
   The program also:
   _Says party units should be allowed to remain in the KGB and
army, but should be clearly separate from the basic power structure.
   _Backs many of Gorbachev's reforms already under way, including
the transition to a market economy and the party's rejection of its
former political monopoly.
   _Proposes more independence for party organizations in the 15
Soviet republics, and allows for the possibility of various
platforms in the party without actually approving full-fledged
factions.

<TEXT>
   The interior minister on Wednesday
accused the former Communist leaders of harboring terrorists,
including the mastermind of a 1975 attack on an OPEC meeting in
Vienna that killed three people.
   The Cabinet minister, Balasz Horvath, said three documents from
the former Communist government indicated the terrorists used
Hungary as a base. Horvath ordered an investigation into the
responsibilities of Communist officials in sheltering terrorists.
   Three former Communist officials named by Horvath _ former
Interior Minister Andras Benkei, former President Karoly Nemeth and
high-ranking party official Antal Gyenes _ have denied any
knowledge of or role in sheltering terrorists.
   Unlike other Eastern European countries where Communists were
removed from power, in Hungary no Communist leader has been
arrested or charged in connection with activities during 45 years
of Communist rule.
   Horvath said it was ``obviously a political decision to let
these people (terrorists) come and stay in Hungary.''
   ``It remains to be proved that they were undergoing training
here, but the inventory seems to point in a certain direction,'' he
told reporters. He did not elaborate.
   He said Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos, who masterminded
the OPEC attack, was among those who had been in Hungary. Ramirez
Sanchez has been blamed for a series of assassinations. In 1975, he
headed Interpol's most-wanted list.
   Horvath said the deputy national police chief, Andras Turos,
went to him with the information over the weekend.
   He said the government documents included a 1979 Interior
Ministry report on the arrival of Carlos and his group and a 1980
ministry report saying the terrorists left behind explosives, guns,
rockets and rocket launchers.
   Horvath said it is not known where the group obtained these
items.
   He said a 1980 letter from Carlos to former Communist Party
leader Janos Kadar thanked Kadar for allowing the group to use
Hungary as a base.
   Benkei was quoted by the Nepszava newspaper on Wednesday as
saying, ``This must be a misunderstanding. I did not deal with such
matters. I retired in 1980. Hiding people? Nonsense. Lies.''
   Nepszabadsag, which used to be the organ of the Communist Party,
stated that according to their information, Carlos and his
associates were indeed in Hungary in those years.
   Citing a ``well-informed'' but unnamed source, the paper stated
that ``a very small circle of leaders knew about the authorization,
and their stay was ... (safeguarded by) state security organs.''
   ``According to the information we have, their stay was not
linked to any terrorist action, but was to provide the terrorists
rest and recreation,'' Nepszabadsag reported Wednesday.
   Another Budapest daily, Magyar Hirlap, said Wednesday that there
had been a terrorist training camp at Csopak, on the northern shore
of Lake Balaton, but provided no further information. Horvath told
reporters that there has been no evidence uncovered so far that
Carlos and his group were in Csopak.

   A worker who was wounded last week

the death toll to 10.
   Jewell Belote, 50, a stenographer at the General Motors

   The 10 dead include James Edward Pough, who turned the
.30-caliber rifle on himself after his June 18 rampage. Four other

   GMAC repossessed Pough's car in January, then notified him in
March that he still owed $6,394, the difference between the car's
resell value and the amount of the loan.
   Pough also killed two people and wounded two others on
Jacksonville streets during the weekend preceeding the office
shooting.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers shot into a crowd of
demonstrators Wednesday who were demanding the president resign,
and doctors said five people were critically wounded. The army said
the shootings were a ``mistake.''
   The troops opened fire when more than 5,000 unarmed civilians
tried to march past the main Barclay Training Center army base to
President Samuel Doe's residence. They were demanding that Doe
resign to end a 6-month-old civil war in which many civilians have
died.
   Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar, commander of Doe's forces, said the
soldiers heard gunfire and feared rebels were attacking the
president's residence, so they began shooting.
   Doctors at JFK Hospital in Monrovia said five people were
admitted with critical injuries. Dubar called the incident ``a
mistake.''
   The government also announced the execution of a private
convicted of killing a Liberian civilian in April.
   Doe's troops have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians
in their effort to halt rebels who have advanced to within 15 miles
of the capital. The government has repeatedly promised to punish
soldiers convicted of harming civilians, but this was the first
known execution.
   Reporters who sought shelter in a shantytown near the Barclay
Training Center barracks heard numerous commands to cease-fire
during the shooting. But the commands were followed by bursts of
gunfire from M-16 rifles and screams from protesters and other
civilians.
   Some witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
saw several demonstrators fall. Some apparently fell into open
drains during a stampede to escape.
   Other witnesses said they saw soldiers beating marchers at the
front of the procession with rifle butts.
   The march, the second in as many days, was organized by the
Citizens' Committee for Democracy and Peace, which includes members
of student unions, trade unions and civic organizations.
   Rebels who have captured most of the country since they began
fighting in December are demanding Doe's resignation. Protesters
have taken up that rallying cry, hoping such a move will end the
fighting.
   Gunshots could be heard all over Monrovia more than an hour
after the incident, including in the plush Mamba Point suburb where
the U.S. and other embassies are located.
   A few hundred yards from the U.S. Embassy, soldiers commandeered
two cars and drive up and down the street, leaning out of the
windows and a sunroof, firing occasional shots into the air.
   Thousands of people marched down Monrovia's main avenue on
Tuesday, demanding Doe's resignation, but soldiers barred them from
going near Doe's palace.
   Tuesday's march, headed by Christian and Moslem leaders, was the
first demonstration in Monrovia calling for Doe's resignation.
   The president has refused rebel demands that he leave office
immediately, but he has agreed not to run for re-election next
year. The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, accuse the
government of corruption.

   Ivana Trump, her family demoted to a $450,000
monthly allowance because of The Donald's financial pickle, should
bail out before she goes down with the yacht, says one celebrity
divorce lawyer.
   ``She should proceed to grab the money and run,'' attorney Raoul
Felder said Wednesday. ``The real problem is, I don't know if she
can grab the money any more. ... She's got to have the board of
directors of various banks decide whether to give her the $25
million.''
   John Scanlon, a spokesman for Mrs. Trump, said she had no plans
to drop her lawsuit demanding half of her debt-ridden, estranged
husband's assets. She is contesting a premarital agreement that
reportedly would give her $25 million, plus a $7 million mansion.
   ``It was only a few months ago, when Mr. Trump's marital
problems were making news, that the general opinion was that his
wife, Ivana, had made a bad deal when she agreed to take only $25
million in case of a divorce,'' observed The New York Times. ``That
no longer seems so paltry.''
   ``She's painted into a corner; there are a lot of creditors who
have to be paid,'' said Felder. ``If I were her adviser, I would
tell her, `You have a wonderful world to conquer.' All the glitter
has gone out of Trump and now is floating around her.''
   In fact, Felder suggests that the timing is right for Mrs. Trump
to cash in on her own cachet: for instance, as a spokeswoman for a
cosmetics firm.
   Whether Mrs. Trump gets wind of Felder's advice or not, her
accountants should be relieved that it's free. The flamboyant
divorce lawyer, who has represented the ex-wives of Mike Tyson, Mel
Brooks, Martin Scorsese and Robin Leach, among others, charges $500
an hour.
   ``She's had a significant number of offers for business
opportunities in the licensing field and product endorsements,''
said Scanlon. ``Right now, she's getting her children settled for
the summer. She'll look at those in the fall.''
   Mrs. Trump's own attorney, Michael Kennedy, doesn't discuss her
case with reporters. It's public knowledge, though, that a group of
banks will closely monitor Donald Trump's personal and business
dealings for years to come as a condition of a $65 million bailout
announced Tuesday.
   The banks crimped the family's monthly allowance to $450,000 and
will pare it to $300,000 by 1992. In comparison, Trump reportedly
had $583,000 in personal expenses in May _ not counting the
$841,000 maintenance on his boat and the $246,000 upkeep on his
private plane.

   A U.S.-financed plane load of relief supplies
worth $470,000 was dispatched Wednesday from Basel, Switzerland,
for victims of the Iranian earthquake, U.S. officials said.
   Included in the cargo, purchased and flown to Iran by the Red
Cross, were five electrical generators, 645 tents and $20,000 worth
of antibiotics and other medical supplies.
   The assistance is the second round of American government
assistance. Earlier this week, the Red Cross flew to Iran $225,000
worth of U.S.-donated blankets, tents, water jugs and
search-and-rescue equipment.
   Meanwhile, private U.S. humanitarian organizations have
dispatched an additional $1.7 million in assistance for victims of
the earthquake, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said she knew of no direct contacts between U.S.
and Iranian officials on the aid. ``We're doing it all through the
Red Cross'' and through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which
represents U.S. interests there, she added.
   ``My understanding of how all of this is working is that they
(the Iranians) are ... making their needs known through the Red
Crescent Society to the Red Cross and (that) various countries,
including our own, ... are responding based on those needs,'' she
said.
   She said she kne of no additional flights of relief supplies,
but added that she ``can't rule out that another request will come
in and that we would certainly fill it.''
   The Iranian government has agreed to accept assistance from the
United States and most other governments but it insists the
assistance be channeled through the Red Cross or other private
relief groups.
   The Iranian foreign minister has said his country welcomes help
due to the magnitude of the earthquake, in which an estimated
50,000 people died, 200,000 were injured and a half-million have
been left homeless.
   The United States broke relations with Iran in 1980 after the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy and the taking of American hostages in
November 1979. The last 52 were released in January 1981.
   Six Americans are now being held hostage in Lebanon by militants
believed to be under Iranian influence.

   Despite international
criticism, Nelson Mandela has not renounced violent struggle
against apartheid because of fears of losing black supporters and a
major bargaining chip.
   Mandela's African National Congress says it cannot disavow
violence until apartheid is abolished. The ANC says it must keep
its armed wing as long as the government and right-wing white
groups retain massive military power and unarmed black protesters
are being killed.
   Black leaders caution against comparing the anti-apartheid
struggle to the non-violent civil rights movement in the American
South in the 1960s. Non-violence is not realistic in a country
where the white government has used force for decades to suppress
blacks, they say.
   Civil rights movements in the United States were often aimed at
local governments and laws instead of the federal government.
Federal courts and troops often acted to protect civil rights
activists and restrain local officials and police.
   Despite controversy in the United States and Europe over
Mandela's refusal to renounce violence, the ANC has all but
suspended its armed struggle due to several factors.
   The legalization of the ANC in February, a call for negotiations
by President F.W. de Klerk, and reductions in aid from the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe have led the ANC to stop high-profile
attacks.
   Even before these developments, the ANC's armed struggle never
posed a serious threat to the government.
   Mandela launched the guerrilla campaign in 1961, a year after
the ANC was outlawed. But attempts to build an effective military
force in South Africa failed because of internal problems and the
superiority of security forces.
   The few attacks blamed on the ANC in recent months have been
hit-and-run attacks on police stations or government buildings that
caused minor damage. Such attacks appear to be the work of small
groups operating independently, and there has been no evidence of
the ANC directing any operations.
   But the armed struggle has had a strong psychological impact on
whites and been a major symbol of resistance to many blacks. Young
blacks believe the armed struggle has been the one way they have
been able to fight apartheid.
   Mandela risks losing the support of thousands of blacks if he
renounces the armed struggle before apartheid is abolished. Such
young blacks, hardened by decades of violence and repression,
glorify strength and believe only violence can end apartheid.
   ``Many of the youngsters are not really interested in
negotiation. In fact, they have become a little bit angry,'' ANC
leader Walter Sisulu said.
   Radical groups that espouse violence, such as the Pan African
Congress, claim they are attracting thousands of former ANC members
disillusioned by Mandela's moderate line. The ANC and allied groups
are locked in a violent struggle with rival black organizations
that has cost thousands of lives.
   Anti-apartheid leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
religious leaders have urged the ANC to at least suspend the armed
struggle to help build peace.
   But the threat of armed struggle is one of the ANC's best
bargaining chips in pending negotiations with the government on
ending apartheid. The ANC says it cannot renounce violence without
similar government concessions.
   Mandela and other black leaders say the government retains
massive military and police power and that blacks are still
suffering oppression. Dozens of blacks have been killed by police
gunfire in recent months, including at least 11 in one incident.
   Mandela also points to extreme right-wing groups with thousands
of members that are forming paramilitary groups to resist attempts
to end white rule. Blacks must be able to defend themselves because
the white government will not suppress such groups, he says.

   A federal judge ruled Wednesday that officials may
extradite the Bank of Greece's former chairman, who is accused of
embezzling $200 million in a scandal that toppled former Premier
Andreas Papandreou.
   U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock upheld a magistrate's
ruling that George Koskotas, 35, may be returned to Greece on
felony charges brought in the alleged scheme to siphon funds from
the bank from 1986 to 1988.
   Koskotas, who was suspended as chairman Oct. 20, 1988, fled his
homeland as the scandal surrounding the Greek socialist government
heated up. He was arrested Nov. 23, 1988, at an airfield in Bedford.
   Woodlock's ruling upheld a magistrate's Aug. 24, 1989, decision
that Koskotas could be extradited on felony charges but barred
extradition on a misdemeanor travel documents charge.
   ``It is one more major step ... toward exhausting the legal
process in trying to avoid being returned to Greece,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Victor A. Wild said. Koskotas could take his case to
the First Circuit Court of Appeals, he said.
   Koskotas' Washington, D.C.-based attorney, Ron Liebman, was out
of town and not immediately available for comment. He has argued
that his client would face retribution at home.
   ``If this court sends Mr. Koskotas back to Greece, he will be
murdered,'' Liebman told Magistrate Joyce L. Alexander at last
year's extradition hearing. ``The cards are stacked against (him)
politically.''
   Under the U.S. extradition treaty with Greece, courts can refuse
to return people accused of political crimes. But prosecutors have
argued that Koskotas' alleged financial scheme does not fit into
this category.
   The ``Koskotas Affair'' paved the way to Papandreou's election
defeat last June amid allegations of corruption among officials in
the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
   The former premier has been accused of authorizing Koskotas'
scheme to siphon money from the Bank of Crete. The banker has said
he acted with Papandreou's approval and put the money into accounts
controlled by the socialist party.
   A special investigator in Athens has been examining the alleged
involvement of Papandreou and four other former government
ministers. The Greek parliament last September indicted all five
men in the alleged embezzlement scheme. No trial date has been set.
   Koskotas, who is being held at the Essex County Jail in Salem,
also faces a multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit brought by the Bank
of Crete in federal court in New York.

   Cigarette sales have dropped 14 percent and
state tobacco tax revenues have more than tripled since voters
approved a tobacco tax hike in 1988, the American Lung Association
announced Wednesday.
   ``Proposition 99 is doing exactly what the tobacco industry
feared most,'' Steve Harmon, the association's state president,
said in a statement. ``It is leading to a significant reduction in
smoking.''
   The state cigarette tax was increased from 10 cents a pack to 35
cents by Proposition 99, which voters approved in November 1988.
The sales tax took effect January 1, 1989.
   Cigarette sales have sinced dropped from $2.54 billion in 1988
to $2.18 billion in 1989, while the state's tobacco tax revenue
soared from about $253.8 million in 1988 to $764.4 million in 1989,
the association said.
   Proposition 99 tax revenues are earmarked for anti-smoking
programs, medical research, and health care.

Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
voted 3-2 Wednesday to reshape one of its districts to include a
majority of Hispanic voters. The vote came hours before a federal
judge's deadline.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon ruled June 4 that supervisors
deliberately spread the county's Hispanic population across several
districts when they changed voting boundaries after the 1980
federal census. He said that violated the federal Voting Rights
Act, and imposed a deadline for 3 p.m. Wednesday.
   Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose Third District was restructured,
said the new plan ``does great violence to the Hispanic community.''
   ``It's not fair to the public, and the court will see that it's
unfair,'' he said. ``It's an attempt for the conservative majority
to keep control.''
   According to Edelman's description of the plan, he would
probably face a strong challenge from a Hispanic candidate in
future elections.
   The new, predominantly Hispanic district, which Edelman called
``octopus-shaped,'' includes his own home but transfers much of his
liberal political base to the districts of fellow liberal Kenneth
Hahn and conservative Deane Dana.
   Edelman and Hahn had pushed to increase the number of districts
to seven to meet Kenyon's demands.
   The new plan is subject to the judge's approval; he set a July 5
hearing.
   Kenyon has said that if the plan fails to correct the
violations, he will redraw the district in consultation with the
plaintiffs.
   Hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million residents. But no Hispanic has been elected to the board
since 1875.
   Edelman was re-elected June 5 to a four-year term.
   Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined the U.S.
Justice Department in the lawsuit, said Kenyon's order put the
election results in doubt.
   Kenyon has not said what he plans to do about the June 5
election.

   Genetically altered potatoes that could be
naturally deadly to beetles are being field tested in the Pacific
Northwest, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The outdoor tests were scheduled to begin this week in Prosser,
Wash., said geneticist Charles R. Brown of the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   ``Ultimately, we want to know whether potato plants could use
this genetic weapon to combat Colorado potato beetles with little
or no chemical insecticide,'' he said.
   Brown is based at the agency's vegetable and crop research unit
in Prosser and is collaborating with other scientists from the
University of Washington, Seattle, and another USDA researcher in
Yakima, Wash.
   The quarter-acre potato plots are at Washington State
University's research and extension center in Prosser.
   Brown said the added gene is from a strain of bacterium,
Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, that lives in soil naturally and
makes a beetle-killing protein.
   The Prosser tests were said to be the first in the United States
involving Bt genes placed in potatoes. Other researchers at private
companies and universities, however, have raised tomato, cotton and
tobacco plants that use a Bt gene and show pest resistance.
   Brown said the Colorado potato beetle is ``probably the worst
potato insect pest worldwide'' and that it has become resistant to
many pesticides.

<HEAD>Environmental Officials Offer Plan For Fund to Protect Ozone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental officials proposed a $160 million
global fund Wednesday to help developing nations build industries
that do not rely on chemicals that damage the Earth's protective
ozone layer.
   They also offered to increase the fund by $80 million if China
and India sign a treaty on saving the ozone layer. The two
countries have refused to sign the treaty because they fear the
high cost of converting to ozone-friendly technology.
   The unprecedented idea was announced at the start of a
conference of environmental ministers and officials from about 100
countries. The fund would be voluntary, but it could become a
future model for how to pay for resolving environmental problems.
   The United States, which until two weeks ago opposed creating
such a fund, was posing one of the few obstacles to final
agreement. It demanded a permanent seat on the proposed 15-member
executive committee that would decide how to use the money. Most
delegates favor rotating membership.
   Richard Smith, who led the U.S. delegation in talks this week
that led to the proposal, noted that the United States would
contribute about 25 percent of the fund. ``Our position is that any
country contributing this much should be (permanently) on the
committee,'' he said.
   Some delegates, speaking privately, said the United States was
prepared to compromise and final agreement would be reached by the
time the meeting ends Friday.
   Delegates are representing the 56 countries that signed the
Montreal Protocol of 1987. That treaty called for a 50 percent
reduction in the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by
1996.
   The plan for the $160 million global fund was worked out in
talks that preceded the formal conference.
   Dr. Mostafa Tolba, an Egyptian scientist and executive director
of the U.N. Environment Program, said delegates proposed increasing
the fund by $80 million if China and India signed the Montreal
Protocol.
   ``Far too much is at stake to contemplate failure. We have no
option but to succeed and inshallah (God willing) we will
succeed,'' he said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said her government
would make an initial contribution of $9 million.
   ``We need to speed up action and set ourselves higher targets
and shorter deadlines for reducing and eventually eliminating CFCs
and halons,'' she told delegates.
   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents and
as aerosol propellents, rise into the stratosphere where they break
down in constituent chemical parts. One of these, chlorine,
destroys the thin shield of ozone that filters out harmful
ultraviolet rays.
   Scientists say that without the shield, life on Earth would
perish.
   William Reilly, administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, told delegates: ``Scientific research,
monitoring, and satellite observations have all left no doubt
whatever that the ozone hole is not a theory but a menacing open
window to cancers and cataracts, and that that window must be
shut.''

   U.S. agricultural exports to the major Pacific
Rim countries are increasing again this year but the growth is
smaller than in 1989, an Agriculture Department report said on
Wednesday.
   Exports to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are expected to
increase but will not match the 10 percent gain of 1989 or the 28
percent jump in 1988, the department's Economic Research Servce
said.
   Agricultural sales to Canada are expected to rise sharply in the
fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 because of a change in the
reporting system, the agency said. Sales to Australia and New
Zealand probably will increase.
   ``Economic growth in the developed Pacific Rim slowed for the
second straight year in 1989,'' the report said. ``Rising interest
and inflation rates, and labor shortages in East Asia are straining
the region's economies.''
   One factor was a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the
Japanese yen, which possibly dampened demand for American farm
products, the report said. Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the
currencies of South Korea, Taiwan and Canada, which helped boost
export prospects.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Bans New Nuclear Construction in Russian Republic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday ordered a freeze on new
atomic energy projects beginning next year in the Russian republic
that comprises three-quarters of the Soviet Union's territory.
   A directive from the republic's Parliament, signed by Yeltsin as
Russian president and distributed by the official news agency Tass,
charged that national government ministries are ill-equipped to
process and store radioactive wastes.
   The move highlighted concern about nuclear power in the wake of
the 1986 Chernobyl accident, and was the reform-minded Russian
president's first direct challenge to the Kremlin since he was
elected last month.
   The directive also called on the Russian republic's government
to develop a proposal for banning the burial on Russian territory
of radioactive waste from other nations or in the other 14 Soviet
republics, also beginning next year.
   It was not immediately clear whether the order would cause a
direct confrontation between Yeltsin's government and national
officials over any specific projects.
   A rising anti-nuclear mood across the entire Soviet Union has
forced Soviet officials to delay or cancel several nuclear power
plants the last four years.
   Yeltsin's directive also said the Ministry of the Sea Fleet and
the Defense Ministry added to the problem of nuclear waste. The
order did not directly say military nuclear projects must be frozen
as well, but appeared to include them.
   The seven-point directive cited increasing stockpiles of
radioactive wastes and the ``low technological level of the
management approach to solving the problem of gathering, processing
and eliminating radioactive wastes.''
   It said that combination ``created an unhealthy ecological and
social-psychological situation in a series of regions of the
Russian republic.''
   The directive said the Russian republic would ask that the
Kremlin write a program for dealing with radioactive waste that
includes a time period for implementation and delineates
responsiblity. It called for the program to be worked out before
June 1991.
   The Russian government was instructed to review all existing
radioactive waste sites in its jurisdiction and make
recommendations about how and whether they should be used.
   Until a national program is enacted, the directive said it would
be considered ``unacceptable to start construction of new atomic
energy sites on the territory of the Russian republic from Jan. 1,
1991.''
   The Russian Council of Ministers was instructed to ``prepare a
proposal to prohibit burial on the territory of the Russian
republic the final products of the activity of atomic sites from
other republics and countries beginning Jan. 1, 1991.''
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl plant, in the Ukraine, caught fire and
exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 died.
   The blast spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide
area of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, and also sent a cloud
of radioactive gas around the world.
   This April, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the
accident, the Soviet government decided to resettle 200,000 more
people living in the area of the Chernobyl plant at a cost of about
$26 billion.
   But Soviets, increasingly concerned about contamination of their
environment, also are worried about the safety of nuclear energy
used in industry and to power ships such as ice breakers and
submarines.
   The Soviet government has only recently acknowledged other major
nuclear accidents. Last June, officials said that in 1957 a tank of
radioactive waste exploded at a weapons site in the southern Ural
Mountains, showering almost 400 square miles with radioactive waste
and forcing evacuation of 10,000 people.

   The Supreme Court upheld Arizona's death
penalty law Wednesday in a decision that also removed a
constitutional shadow from similar laws in Idaho and Montana.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the Arizona law is valid even
though judges, not juries, decide whether a murderer's sentence
should be death or life in prison.
   Had the justices ruled the other way, new proceedings could have
been required for the 88 people on Arizona's death row and perhaps
for all or most of the death row inmates in Idaho and Montana. As
of last month, Idaho had 19 inmates on death row; Montana had six.
   No one has been executed in those three states since the Supreme
Court allowed states to resume capital punishment in 1976.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction
over nine Western states including Arizona, Idaho and Montana,
previously issued a decision in conflict with the Arizona Supreme
Court's ruling in Walton's case.
   The federal appeals court threw out the death sentence of John
Harvey Adamson, convicted of murdering Phoenix newspaper reporter
Don Bolles in 1976.
   Wednesday's decision likely means the 9th Circuit court's
ruling, on appeal by Arizona before the justices, will be set aside
_ perhaps as early as Thursday when some house-cleaning orders are
to be issued.
   ``I think this moves us much closer to executions,'' said
Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin. But he added that the first
executions might be as long as six months off.
   ``The issues are the same,'' in the Adamson case, Corbin said.
   Corbin criticized the 9th Circuit judges for what he said was
``finding some Mickey Mouse reason'' to overturn every death
sentence that goes before them.
   Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones said, ``This removes probably
the most serious impediment to moving forward with the death
penalty in Idaho.'' In Montana, Assistant Attorney General Pat
Schaeffer Jordan said Wednesday's ruling would apply there as well.
   Writing for the high court, Justice Byron R. White said
convicted murderer Jeffrey Alan Walton properly was sentenced to
death for robbing and killing Thomas Powell near Tucson four years
ago.
   Powell on March 2, 1986 was robbed in a bar parking lot, and
then driven in his own car to a secluded area and shot.
   A jury heard testimony that Walton put a gun to Powell's head
and fired the fatal shot. Walton denied he killed Powell, swearing
that a co-defendant was the triggerman.
   The jury did not specify whether it found Walton guilty of
premeditated murder or ``felony murder,'' the taking of a life
during the commission of a felony.
   After the jury convicted Walton, Judge G. Thomas Meehan
conducted a hearing, without a jury as Arizona law requires, to
consider all aggravating and mitigating factors in the case.
   He sentenced Walton to die in the state's gas chamber, and the
sentence was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court.
   White said Arizona's law is not that different from Florida's,
which the court already had upheld. In Florida, a jury makes a
sentencing recommendation which can be followed or ignored by a
judge.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   In a separate ruling, the court also upheld the death sentence
of Arizona death row inmate Jimmy Wayne Jeffers, convicted of

<HEAD>Government Considers Closing Down Small Hawaiian Airline</HEAD>

   A Transportation Department official said
Wednesday he is considering whether to close down Hawaii-based
Discovery Airlines for allegedly operating under illegal foreign
ownership and control.
   The three-month-old carrier flies six leased planes on
inter-island flights in competition with both Hawaiian and Aloha
airlines, who claim Discovery is owned primarily by Japanese
interests and run largely by an Italian.
   Patrick Murphy, the deputy assistant secretary designated to
decide the matter, said he would ``give considerable weight'' to
the recommendation of an administrative law judge.
   The judge, Ronnie A. Yoder, declared Tuesday that cancellation
of Discovery's temporary permit to operate ``would appear to be a
more appropriate action'' than granting it a requested extension.
   Yoder said the airline and department lawyers imply in a
proposed settlement that Discovery does not qualify as a U.S.
airline. The judge also said the airline admitted to ``substantial
prior misrepresentations'' in seeking authority to operate.
   The judge said the fact that the proposed settlement includes
sale of a share in the airline to qualify it as a U.S. airline is
an admission that it ``has operated from its inception as a
non-U.S. citizen air carrier in violation of the Federal Aviation
Act and that its submissions to the department ... were false and
constituted misrepresentation in violation of federal law.''
   Such actions should not be rewarded with an extension of the
airline's operating permit, as proposed by the department's
lawyers, Yoder said.
   The law requires that U.S. airlines have no more than 25 percent
foreign ownership and that they not be controlled by foreigners
   Discovery is 75 percent owned by Philip Ho, who other airlines
claim got his funds from Nansay Corp. of Japan. Ho is president of
Nansay's operations in Hawaii.
   The judge recommended against the proposed settlement of the
issue by Discovery and department lawyers. The proposal would have
allowed Ho to sell most of his stock in Discovery and had the
airline pay a $50,000 fine for making misstatements.
   The administrative law judge also cited evidence that Franco
Mancassola, an Italian citizen, is effectively Discovery's
executive vice president, earning twice as much as its president.
   ``We are disappointed that the administrative law judge did not
concur with the consent order,'' said Discovery President Don
Straight. ``However, we are gratified that he saw fit to forward
the consent order to the decision maker for an expedited review. We
continue to be hopeful of a prompt and fair decision.''
   Transportation Department lawyers said problems with Discovery's
application were not intentional and would not warrant criminal
prosecution.
   Hawaiian Airlines, however, said it would ask the Justice
Department to investigate Discovery's actions in starting up its
passenger service.
   Hawaiian, in business for 61 years, on Tuesday announced a $9.9
million suit against the new airline, claiming lost revenue because
of Discovery's allegedly fraudulent actions.
   A. Maurice Myers, Aloha Airlines president, said the law judge
``has seen through the thinly veiled sham created by the Nansay
Corporation and Discovery.''

<HEAD>Peace Corps Pulling Volunteers Out of Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peace Corps is pulling its volunteers out
of the Philippines to make sure they are not killed or kidnapped by
Communist rebels, the agency said Wednesday.
   ``All of the volunteers are safe, and this is strictly a
precautionary measure,'' Peace Corps Director Paul Coverdell said
in a statement.
   The agency suspended its program after learning that ``Peace
Corps volunteers may be among those targeted by the armed wing of
the Communist Party,'' Coverdell said.
   He said the White House and the State Department were involved
in the decision to recall the 261 volunteers, most of whom were
working in remote rural areas with poor security.
   For a month, Americans have been cautioned by the State
Department to be careful traveling in the Philippines. But they
have not been told to stay away, or to leave.
   ``We see no reason, at the moment, to change the advisory,''
said Philip Covington, a department spokesman.
   The travel advisory, posted May 28 with the onset of
negotiations over the use of the U.S.-run Clark Air Base and naval
facilities at Subic Bay, specified that ``serious problems'' exist
in urban areas.
   ``We have advised Americans that a threat exists against U.S.
government personnel and facilities, and the threat is heightened
with the bases negotiations,'' Covington said.
   The Peace Corps volunteers are scheduled to leave Thursday after
a special send-off from Philippine President Corazon Aquino. They
will fly to Hawaii to finish their service or discuss other
assignments.
   Coverdell stressed that the Philippines program is being
suspended, not cancelled, and said the agency's office in Manila
would remain open.
   ``It is my desire that Peace Corps volunteers will soon return
to the Philippines,'' Coverdell said. ``This program is too
valuable ... to leave it in a state of suspension for any longer
than is absolutely necessary.''
   The State Department made clear that none of the present
volunteers are likely to be returning to their posts in the
Philippines.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that after they arrive in
Hawaii, the volunteers will attend a ``close-of-service
conference'' at the University of Hawaii.
   ``Some of the volunteers will go on to work in other
countries,'' she said. ``Others will be ending their Peace Corps
service early.''
   A senior U.S. official in Manila said the move does not imply a
lack of support for the Aquino government. Concern that it might be
viewed that way ``has to be balanced against the greater downside
of having a Peace Corps volunteer kidnapped or killed,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Philippine military said last week that rebels in Manila
planned to target Americans and other foreigners for assassination
and kidnapping in the next six months. The U.S. Embassy recalled
all Peace Corps volunteers to Manila over the weekend after
receiving a report that they had been added to the target list.
   The rebels have made no specific public threats against the
volunteers but have charged that U.S. and Japanese aid workers
secretly assist the Philippine government in its counterinsurgency
operations. Both the U.S. and Japanese governments deny the charges.
   The Communist New People's Army has been fighting for 21 years
to establish a Marxist government in the Philippines. The rebels
are believed to have killed eight Americans in the Philippines
since April 1989.
   They claimed responsibility for the deaths of two U.S. airmen
last month near Clark Air Base, and threatened to kill more until
all U.S. troops leave the Philippines.
   Some U.S. officials have complained privately that the Aquino
government has not been aggressive in guaranteeing the safety of
the estimated 140,000 Americans in the Philippines. Senior embassy
officials, however, have expressed satisfaction with security
arrangements.
   Peace Corps volunteers had been involved in education,
environment, agriculture and community development projects
throughout the main Philippine island, Luzon, and the central
Visayas chain. They were recalled from the southern island of
Mindanao in 1985 because of lawlessness and never returned.
   Coverdell said more than 7,500 volunteers had served in the
Philippines since 1961 when the Peace Corps was founded, making it
one of the agency's oldest and most successful programs.

   The leader of the U.S.-armed rebels in Angola
is urging President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to
undertake a joint emergency airlift of food and medicine to
starving Angolans, the rebel group said Wednesday.
   In letters to the two leaders, Jonas Savimbi also called for a
cease-fire in Angola's 15-year civil war and the creation of
protected land corridors to allow safe passage of relief supplies.
   Savimbi, who heads the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, also wrote Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
urging him to accept the plan, the organization said.
   Bush and Gorbachev agreed earlier this month to mount a joint
airlift of food for starving Ethiopians with U.S. food flown on
Soviet planes. Bush and Gorbachev also discussed joint sponsorship
of peace talks between Savimbi and the Soviet-backed government of
Dos Santos.
   In the first signs of possible peace progress, UNITA and
government officials held two rounds of talks in Portugal in recent
weeks but they are divided on how to proceed.
   The UNITA announcement said hundreds of thousands of people face
starvation in regions controlled by its forces, as a result of
drought in recent years.
   Dos Santos, in a letter to the House of Representatives' Select
Committee on Hunger, estimated that 1.55 million Angolans ``run the
risk of death from hunger.'' The letter, dated June 7 and made
available to The Associated Press, said more than 500 Angolans have
already died because of the drought.
   Dos Santos, responding to a letter from the committee that urged
him and Savimbi to support international relief organizations like
the Red Cross, promised to cooperate.
   But he suggested such aid would have to be distributed by
Angolan government agencies, a move Savimbi is likely to reject.
   Savimbi's proposal for ``corridors of peace'' would establish
agreed routes into each side's territory for the safe passage of
international relief convoys.
   The rebel chief said a similar approach worked successfully in
rebel and government-held territories in Sudan.
   The United States secretly gives Savimbi more than $40 million
of weapons annually. U.S. officials say the Soviets give Dos Santos
at least $600 million annually.

   Bill Price remembers falling from the
scaffold, clawing helplessly at the air. And he remembers looking
in horror at his right shoulder. His arm was gone, torn off by a
wrought-iron fence spike.
   ``When I was laying there on the ground I looked over and I seen
it wasn't there,'' Price said Wednesday.
   He spoke at a news conference to announce the improbable: He
plans to go home Saturday, his arm reattached by surgeons at Thomas
Jefferson University Hospital.
   How much sensitivity and strength will return to his arm and
hand can't be immediately known, and recovery depends on years of
physical therapy, his surgeon said.
   ``I just hope I don't wake up tomorrow and it's gone,'' said
Price, 32, his voice breaking.
   ``I got it back now.''
   On June 18, Price was pointing stone on a building in Scranton
when a balcony gave way and he fell three floors into an open
stairway.
   His arm caught on the fence and was severed about 4 inches below
the shoulder.
   Dr. John Taras, the orthopedic surgeon who led the five-hour
effort to reattach the arm, praised fast-acting emergency workers
who packed the arm in ice, helping to keep the muscle alive.
   Price was taken to Scranton's Community Medical Center, which
alerted Thomas Jefferson. In Philadelphia, 2{ hours after the
accident, Taras and Dr. Richard Uhl were working on the arm,
sorting out blood vessels and nerves. Price was in the operating
room within another hour.
   And within hour after that, blood was flowing to the arm.
   ``Blood flow is essential to keep the muscle living,'' Taras
said.
   Surgeons spent five hours reconnecting the large artery that
brings blood from the heart to the limb, reattaching the bone with
a metal insert and reconnecting three large veins and three major
nerves.
   ``Reattached, replanted arms generally are functioning
usefully,'' Taras said. ``We've seen professional musicians have
their fingers amputated and go back to playing as a professional
musician.''
   The biggest factor in Price's recovery, he said, ``is his
resolve to get better and to accomplish what he wants.''
   Price was perched on a scaffold set up on a balcony at the
Throop Memorial Building, adjacent to St. Luke's Church in the
northeastern Pennsylvania city. The masonry balcony gave way and he
plunged to the ground.
   ``I was trying to stop myself but there was no way of stopping.
I knew I was falling and that was it,'' said Price, of Luzerne, who
is married and the father of a 10-year-old boy and 6-year-old girl.
   When he saw his injury, he was ``in shock, panic _ I was in
something, I don't know what.''
   ``I thought it was gone. I thought it was completely gone,'' he
said.
   Price was asked what he would do if the injury kept him from
construction work or his favorate pastime, dirt-track car racing.
   ``I don't know. That's all I ever did,'' he said.
   His current state of mind, he said, is ``total confusion, just
total confusion right now.''

   A woman testified Wednesday that a gang of
youths terrified her and tried to pull her off a bicycle in Central
Park on the night a female jogger was gang-raped and beaten nearly
to death in the same area of the park.
   Patricia Dean said she and her fiance, Gerald Malone, were
riding through the park on a tandem bicycle when 30 youths attacked
them.
   Dean told Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer the
teen-agers saw her and Malone coming, and several moved into the
roadway, pulling hoods over their heads and ``making animal noises,
grunting.''
   ``At that point I was terrified. Jerry aimed the bike at them.
As we came through them, they were pulling at us.''
   She said one youth pulled on her leg and shoulder. ``Three on
the right were pushing and the whole bike was swerving.''
   ``We just kept going as fast as we could,'' drove out of the
park, found a telephone and called police, Dean said.
   Dean testified at the trial in Manhattan's state court of three
teen-agers charged with the rape and attempted murder of a female
runner the night of April 19, 1989.
   The jogger, an investment banker who was then 28, was
gang-raped, beaten, and left naked and near death in a puddle of
mud and blood.
   She survived, but suffered brain damage and has no recollection
of what happened to her that night, Lederer said.
   Antron McCray, 15, Raymond Santana, 16, and Yusef Salaam, 16,
are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault,
robbery and riot in connection with the attack on the jogger and on
two men who were less seriously injured.
   Three other youths, Kevin Richardson, 15, Stephen Lopez, 16, and
Kharey Wise, 17, are to stand trial on the same charges later this
year.
   Malone, an advertising executive, testified that he could not
identify any of the youths in a photograph taken by police of
suspects in the attacks. But he said a shirt worn in the photo by
Richardson was similar to one worn by one of the youths who tried
to attack him and Dean.
   It was the first time anyone other than a participant in the
rampage had drawn any link between the defendants and the attacks
in the park.
   In other testimony, banker David Lewis, 31, said he suffered a
deep and painful bruise when he was hit by a member of a gang of
teen-agers he encountered on the north side of the jogging path
around the Central Park reservoir.
   Able to run a six-minute mile, Lewis said he believes he escaped
serious injury by outrunning the youths.

   How hot is it? Well, when your house has no
air conditioning and your car doesn't either, 112 degrees is well
past the boiling point for life in general.
   Sleep is elusive. Your brain short-circuits. In the middle of
the night, laying in a puddle of your own sweat, the heat dragons
begin to romp.
   Questions such as, ``At what point will the gas in my engine
begin to boil?'', take on profound proportions.
   How long does it take for dehydration to set in? Will my tires
melt in gridlock? Will the greenhouse effect make us all end up
like that ``Twilight Zone'' episode in which the Earth is literally
burning up?
   Or, spontaneous combustion _ fact or fiction?
   It has never been 112 degrees in Los Angeles before. And they
say there's no such thing as global warming.
   Sure, L.A. has sweltered now and then. Malibu usually catches on
fire in weather like this. Earthquakes occur.
   But there's something different about this heat wave. This is
surreal. No, this is absurd. Hot winds are blasting a static
electricity that makes the hair on your arms hurt. It was 106
degrees at 8 o'clock Tuesday night.
   Something bad is going to happen.
   Everywhere you go, every person you meet, the topic of
conversation is heat. Callers from the East Coast laugh at your
complaints. ``You should be stuck in a subway train with your face
pushed into someone's armpit when it's 99 degrees and the humidity
is 100 percent,'' they say. ``Now that's hot.''
   No, that's disgusting.
   Hot is being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the Santa
Monica Freeway at 8 a.m. with no air conditioning, and it's already
100 degrees. Hot is when the bowl of M&amp;Ms on your coffee table
melts. Hot is being awakened by an editor who, after you've finally
fallen into sweat-induced slumber, tells you to write a story about
how hot it is.
   It's so hot you need gloves to touch the steering wheel of your
car. It's so hot the little man selling oranges in the median of La
Cienega Boulevard was nowhere to be found Wednesday morning. It's
so hot that a morning disc-jockey team warned listeners to be on
the lookout for freeway shooters.
   People are grumpy. People are dying of heat prostration. The
asphalt in Glendale shimmers like Highway 190 in Death Valley.
Sweat trickles down the back of your shirt and collects in your
waistband.
   In our upstairs sweatbox of an apartment, my roommate has come
up with some highfalutin' concept that entails closing all but one
window and placing a fan in front of it, blowing out. It doesn't
help.
   Filling the bathtub with cold water and the contents of four ice
trays does, however. If you could sleep there without drowning,
life would be tolerable.

   A money shortage that could force 240,000
low-income women and children out of a government nutrition program
is not an emergency, an administration official said on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, a bill that will help states get more money for the
supplemental food program for women, infants and children, or WIC,
was moving quickly through the House.
   The House education and labor committee approved a measure by
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, to let states borrow a greater amount of
next year's WIC appropriation to cover current shortages. Hall
introduced the bill Monday and a vote on the House floor could
occur Thursday, officials said.
   House members criticized the Department of Agriculture, which
administers WIC, for not seeking more money for the program, which
has been battered in at least 20 states by food price increases and
rebate reductions.
   ``It's an absolute outrage,'' said Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas.
``Why isn't the administration up here urging an emergency
supplemental appropriations bill?''
   ``This program faces a dire crisis,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., who chaired a hearing on WIC by the House budget
committee's task force on human resources.
   Betty Jo Nelsen, administrator of the USDA's Food and Nutrition
Service, said $11 million was being reallocated this week to make
up for spending or budget shortfalls in some states.
   ``It will clearly not be enough,'' Ms. Nelsen said. But, when
pressed by task force members, she refused to call the funding
shortage an emergency.
   ``I would characterize it as a very difficult situation,'' Ms.
Nelsen said. ``I would save severe crisis or emergency for when we
can't serve women and children with medically related nutritional
risks.''
   The National Association of WIC Directors said Tuesday that $72
million is needed to keep about 240,000 women and children from
being dropped. Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion this year for
WIC, which provides milk, cheese, juice, cereal, peanut butter and
other food to 4.5 million participants.
   The states hardest hit by potential cutbacks include California,
New York, Texas and Florida.

   President Bush on Wednesday offered to forgive
a portion of $12 billion owed the government by Latin American and
Caribbean countries and proposed a free trade zone for the entire
Western Hemisphere.
   The president also proposed ``debt-for-nature'' swaps to
encourage third-world countries to protect natural resources.
   Bush, in a major speech on U.S. trade and investment policies
toward the region, offered new proposals centered around trade,
investment and the Latin nations' debt to the U.S. government.
   It marked the first time the administration had shown a
willingness to write off a portion of the government debt _ which
would still leave the $48.3 billion the Latin nations owe U.S.
banks.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said $7 billion in
low-interest loans among the $12 billion was eligible to be
forgiven, but the process could take several years.
   ``Obviously it's going to take a lot of consultation with the
Congress,'' to work out the bilateral debt agreements with each
nation, he said.
   The debt forgiveness would be contingent on economic and
investment reforms the debtor nations would work out with the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   The president, speaking to administration officials and Latin
ambassadors in the White House East Room, said he wants to
eliminate trade and tariff barriers between the United States and
the Latin and Caribbean nations, ``particularly with groups of
countries that have associated for the purposes of trade
liberalization.''
   The Central American nations recently agreed to form a common
economic unit known as the Central American Economic Community, and
there have been several other attempts by Latin American countries
to cooperate on trade and economic matters in the past.
   The United States already has an open trade policy with Canada
and is discussing a similar arrangement with Mexico.
   In his remarks, Bush proposed ``that we begin the process of
creating a hemisphere-wide free trade zone; to increase investment,
that we adopt measures to create a new flow of capital into the
region, and to further ease the burden of debt, a new approach to
debt in the region _ with important benefits for our environment.''
   Bush said he was proposing a ``major new initiative to reduce
Latin America and the Caribbean's official debt to the U.S., for
countries that adopt strong economic and investment reform programs
with the support of international institutions.''
   Brady told reporters that the proposals were designed to address
problems that cannot be rectified under the ``Brady plan'' that the
Bush administration put forward last year to deal with foreign debt
to commercial banks.
   That plan called for the banks to forgive part of the loans. The
International Monetary Fund and World Bank would lend money to the
borrowing countries to buy back old debt at a discount.
   Bush also said the United States wants the International
Development Bank to create a new lending program for countries
``that take significant steps to remove impediments to
international investment.'' Such impediments include bureaucratic
and logistical blockades to potential investors, he indicated.
   The United States, Bush said, is prepared in addition to
contribute $100 million to a proposed IDB-administered ``investment
fund for the Americas.''
   He said he will seek matching contributions from Japan and
Europe, to bring the fund to $300 million that would be used for
grants to countries that make broad investment reforms.
   On the environmental front, Bush recommended creation of
environmental trusts into which loan interest payments on U.S.
loans can be paid. The money would be used to finance environmental
programs in the debtor countries, he said.
   ``These innovative agreements offer a powerful new tool for
preserving the natural wonders of this hemisphere we share,'' he
said.
   In response to a reporter's question, Brady conceded that the
administration's debt forgiveness plan for Latin America could set
a precedent for other parts of the world. The new government of
Poland has been lobbying the United States and other Western
countries to forgive its $39 billion in official loans and saying
such a write-down is critical to its economic reforms.
   Besides the debts owed to the U.S. government, the Latin
countries owe $48.3 billion to U.S. banks. Brazil's $19.1 billion
is the largest portion.
   John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said after hearing Bush's
speech that it was ``the first time I've heard the United States
government focus on economic development in Latin America in a
regional sense and giving it the priority the president gave it.''
   Reed said Citicorp is owed about $8 billion by Latin American
countries, but he said, ``We're not uncomfortable with our existing
exposure.''

   A conservative fund-raising group on Wednesday
announced plans to launch an ad campaign attacking U.S. Senate
candidate David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader running as a
Republican in Louisiana.
   Floyd Brown, founder of the Republican Challengers Committee,
said the political action committee had targeted Duke because he
was ``a racist pretending to be a Republican out of convenience.''
   ``He is trying to establish himself as the leader of the
conservative movement and we have to stop that,'' Brown said.
   Duke is running against Democratic incumbent Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston and Republican state Sen. Ben Bagert. The three will meet
in an Oct. 6 open primary.
   Bagert is the GOP's endorsed candidate but polls have shown Duke
running second behind Johnston. If no candidate gets more than 50
percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off in
November.
   Brown said his group hopes to spend $1 million to defeat Duke.
However, the group had just $8,900 on hand as of May 31 and debts
of nearly $80,000, according to Federal Election Commission records.
   Brown said he had $30,000 in new pledges for the anti-Duke
effort and was confident he could raise plenty more.
   Brown and his partners at the Republican Challengers Committee
earlier worked with another PAC that spent $10 million attacking
1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis for granting
furloughs to convicted murderer Willie Horton, who raped a Maryland
woman while on furlough.
   Duke, in a telephone interview, criticized Brown's plans but
said he was not concerned.
   ``If they were truly concerned and truly interested in
Republicanism they would be spending their money against the
liberal Democrat J. Bennett Johnston,'' said Duke, a member of the
state House. ``I have a perfect voting record on conservative
principles.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Hitler's Art, Photographs Worth $6.8 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge set at $6.8 million the value of
an art cache seized by the U.S. government that includes four
watercolors painted by a young Adolf Hitler and photographic
archives of pre-war Europe and Nazi Germany.
   U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes also ruled Tuesday that the
items could have produced more than $1.1 million in income through
the sale of reproductions during the years of legal wrangling over
their ownership.
   Billy F. Price of Houston, who helped locate the articles in the
early 1980s, had sought to have them valued at more than $30
million.
   The latest findings open the way for Price to seek monetary
damages based on the income he has not received since the
government seized the paintings, said Larry A. Campagna, one of
Price's attorneys.
   The U.S. government, which can not appeal any of Hughes'
decisions in the suit until a final judgment is issued, has argued
that Price is not entitled to any money.
   The paintings and photographs were seized by the U.S. Army in
1945 in Germany.
   The family of Heinrich Hoffman, who operated a photographic
business in Europe before and during World War II and who was given
the paintings by Hitler, claimed they owned the items.
   Price, a Houston businessman and collector of Hitler's work who
helped the Hoffmans locate the articles and bought an interest from
the family, has been battling the U.S. government for their
possession.
   The judge last year ruled that the government had no right to
the items, in what may have been the first decision favoring a U.S.
citizen claiming articles captured in a war by the Army.
   In his findings, the judge said the value of the watercolors lay
in the fact they were painted by Hitler rather than by ``an obscure
early twentieth-century German watercolor artist.''
   Hitler's watercolors portray street scenes and war landscapes
painted before and during World War I.
   The photographs include one depicting Rudolf Hess with his
family, Mickey Mouse painted on a Nazi aircraft and Nazis ``engaged
in horse play.''

   It's enough to leave the town glassy-eyed
with pride: not only does Ridgeley have the nation's best marbles
player, it has the second best, too.
   The town of 990 was also home to the girls' champions in 1987
and 1988.
   Carl Whitacre, 12, last week won the National Marble Tournament
boys' division, and Mickey Lantz, 13, was runner-up.
   The two beat out about 58 other boys during the competition in
Wildwood, N.J., including 22 other West Virginians.
   They ended up facing each other for the championship. During the
15-game title set, Lantz led 7-4, but Whitacre won the last four
games without giving Lantz a chance to shoot.
   ``I bawled because I lost. That's 2,000 bucks down the drain,''
said Lantz, referring to a $2,000 scholarship Whitacre won along
with the title.
   But no hard feelings.
   `He's going to win it next year,'' said Whitacre.
   Whitacre won't be eligible because of his win this year. But
he'll be back in Wildwood as a referee, he said, and he wants to
coach other ``mibsters,'' as marbles players are called.
   Whitacre's aunt won the girls' championship in 1987 and Lantz'
sister won in 1988.
   Youths in the eastern West Virginia town must fight their way
through two local tournaments to get a shot at the national
tournament.
   ``It gets as exciting as a football game in the (local)
finals,'' said Tonyia Dickel, Whitacre's grandmother.

<HEAD>Samson's Letter to Delilah Reported Found Among Dead Sea Scrolls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scholar said Wednesday that a portion of a
letter from the biblical strongman Samson, possibly a love note to
the temptress Delilah, had been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
   John Strugnell, head of a 22-member team of scholars with
exclusive access to most of the unpublished scrolls, said he
recently stumbled on a fragment containing nine words and three
lines of the letter.
   ``It has to be a copy of a letter sent by Samson ... (but was
it) to Delilah? Unfortunately, we don't know,'' he said, adding he
had deciphered little about what Samson wrote at this point but
would publish more details soon.
   Strugnell, the world's leading expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls,
said it was clear from the first few words of the letter, what he
called the ``address,'' that it was without question from Samson.
   He suggested that it may be a love letter because it fit into
the context of ``erotic and sapient literature'' that developed in
the early Jewish period. The letter was not signed, he said.
   No other information was made available about the letter.
   Samson, whose story is told in the Book of Judges, was known for
feats of enormous strength, such as slaying 1,000 Philistines with
the jawbone of a mule. But he was stopped by Delilah, who was sent
by the Philistines. She seduced him, learned that the secret to his
strength was his hair and cut it off while he was sleeping.
   Strugnell, a Harvard University professor, announced the
existence of the letter as an example of discoveries that are
expected in the near future from the scroll research.
   He and other scholars on a five-member oversight committee that
controls access to the scrolls defended the slow pace of publishing
manuscripts from the ancient library found at Qumran on the Dead
Sea from 1947-52.
   They also responded to criticism that they unfairly prevented
other scholars from looking at scroll fragments during a news
conference held in conjunction with the Second International
Conference on Biblical Archaeology.
   Shmaryahu Talmon, a Hebrew University scholar on the Israeli
oversight committee, told reporters measures had been introduced
the past three years to expand access, to set timetables for
publication and to compile a catalogue of manuscripts and published
scroll studies.
   ``The pace has been speeded up without lowering standards of
scholarship,'' Talmon said. ``We will try to open up as far as
possible the material we have.''
   Talmon said scrolls have already been published and 50 plates of
fragments that have not been assigned to scholars on the team will
be open for inspection by researchers.
   However, he said access would not be granted to material held by
the research team because scholars had invested whole careers in
piecing together fragments and they should have the right to
publish the material first.
   ``It would not be fair to rob them of the fruit of their
labor,'' Talmon said.
   Robert Eisenman, head of the religion department at California
State University at Long Beach and a leading critic of the system,
said the changes represented some progress but that after 40 years
scholars should have ``absolutely open access.''
   ``They drop new bombshells every now and then to deflect people
from the basic problem,'' he said, referring to Strugnell's
announcement. ``Control of the manuscripts is control of
interpretation and control of the field.''
   Eisenman, reached by telephone in California, said he and other
``opposition voices'' had not been invited to address the
conference. He accused the Israel Antiquities Authority of
acquiescing to the ``clubism'' that froze out more than 500
qualified experts from studying the original manuscripts.
   Magen Broshi, curator of the Shrine of the Book where some
scrolls are on public display, disputed critics' claims that less
than half the documents had been made public.
   He estimated about 70 to 80 percent of the 90,000 words of
biblical texts, letters, and other documents from the Qumran
library had been deciphered and published.
   Amir Drori, head of the Antiquities Authority which has final
say over the manuscripts, said a general deadline of 1997 had been
set for completing study of the scrolls and the year 2000 for
publication. He said some material might be reassigned if deadlines
were not met.
   Officials also announced plans to begin carbon-dating portions
of the Dead Sea scrolls. Based on handwriting styles, the earliest
manuscripts were estimated to date to 200 B.C. and be the work of a
Jewish sect. But some scholars suggest unpublished scrolls may be
the work of early Christians.

<HEAD>Drive Launched to Repeal Sanctions for Hiring Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators of both parties on Wednesday launched
a drive to repeal federal sanctions against employers who hire
illegal aliens, saying the penalties cause discrimination in hiring.
   ``In my view, employer sanctions simply are not worth the price
in increased employment discrimination and increased burdens on
business,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told a news conference.
   He was joined in unveiling legislation that would repeal the
sanctions by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.
   ``I support reasonable measures to achieve the goal of these
sanctions,'' Kennedy said. ``In this case, however, Congress made
the wrong move. We aimed at illegal aliens _ but we hit law-abiding
Americans and it is time to rectify the mistake.''
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, designed to curb an
influx of illegal aliens over the southern border, calls for the
sanctions, which range from $250 fines to six months in jail
depending on the circumstances.
   The General Accounting Office reported to Congress in March that
the sanctions have caused ``widespread'' hiring discrimination
against those with ethnic names or who appear foreign in the eyes
of employers wary lest they make an error and incur a fine.
   The repeal measure also includes provisions that would bolster
the Border Patrol with additional agents and $50 million in new
funds and toughening penalties for transporting and harboring
illegal aliens.
   ``Reducing illegal immigration should be placed back onto the
shoulders of law enforcement,'' DeConcini said.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., at a later news conference renewed
his criticism of the GAO report, saying it was impossible to
determine whether employer sanctions were soley responsible for
discrimination.
   He said sponsors of the repeal measure are ``now using the GAO
report as a hook to achieve their obsessive original agenda and
goal which was to kill employer sanctions.''
   ``They today are making a last frantic and exasperated gasp and
grasp at achieving their objective during this Congress,'' Simpson
said.
   He said that if the sanctions are repealed ``illegal immigration
will increase, more illegal aliens will be exploited and some
employers will return to the practice of paying these people
peanuts and profiting from their misery and their labor.''

   ``We suspect that in the technique used to measure and polish
the mirror, there was an error made in the primary or secondary and
it resulted in the mirrors being made to the wrong number,'' he
said. By ``wrong number,'' he meant manufactured to the wrong
curvature.
   The two mirrors were tested individually on the ground, said
Oliver, and passed all tests. He said they were not tested in
combination on the ground because this would have required a test
arrangement that would have cost ``hundreds of millions of
dollars.''
   Before it was launched, NASA said the Hubble, operating from
281-mile orbit, far above the obscuring effects of the Earth's
atmosphere, would capture views of the universe never before
possible.
   The five instruments on the craft, the agency said, would detect
objects 25 times fainter than the dimmest seen from Earth, and
would expand the size of the observable universe by 250 times.
   Objects in the farthest reaches of the universe, some 14 billion
light years or 82 billion trillion miles away, would be visible to
the Hubble, the space agency said. Since the universe is thought to
be 15 to 20 billion years old, the telescope would be seeing
objects only a short time after the so-called big bang that
astronomers believe is the origin of the universe.
   In addition to power, the agency said the Hubble also would have
an unprecedented clarity, about 10 times that of telescopes on
Earth, and would be able to hold steady for many minutes on
extremely faint objects.
   Instead, Weiler said, the flawed telescope now is able to gather
only a fraction of the light that NASA had expected.
   He said the telescope is designed to capture about 70 percent of
the visible light from a distant star, but with the focusing flaw
it can now gather only about 20 percent of the light.
   ``We're a factor of three and a half off,'' he said.
   Despite this, NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said the flawed
Hubble still will be a valuable observatory.
   ``You'll find many fundamental discoveries from Hubble as it
works today,'' Fisk said at the news conferecne. ``I think you'll
be very pleased with the investment even as it is today.''

   Aftershocks rumbled through northern Iran on
Wednesday, shaking buildings and killing a relief worker who was
trying to dig out bodies buried under debris by last week's
earthquake.
   Bad weather hampered rescue efforts and was blamed for the crash
of a relief helicopter with 14 people on board that hit a mountain
in Gilan province. One person died and six others were reported
seriously injured.
   Tens of thousands of people took shelter in tent cities set up
with the help of foreign volunteers. About a half-million people
were left homeless by Thursday's quake, which registered 7.3 to 7.7
on the Richter scale.
   Officials at the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the Red
Cross, said they counted 40,000 dead and 60,000 injured. Government
officials earlier said 50,000 people died and 200,000 were injured.
   A Red Cross official said Tuesday the death toll could reach
70,000.
   More than 205 people hurt in the quake died of their injuries
Wednesday in hospitals in Zanjan province, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   IRNA said Mohammad Hossein Eftekhari, a Parliament deputy from
Rudbar, a city in Gilan, was killed in the crash of the Chinook
helicopter near Kelishom, 100 miles northwest of Tehran. The pilot
suffered severe burns, a passenger broke his back and four others
suffered serious injuries, IRNA said.
   In Jirandeh, a man and a woman were rescued on Tuesday, and two
other people were found alive in Vieh the same day, IRNA reported
Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, IRNA said a 19-year-old volunteer died Wednesday in
Rudbar. A wall collapsed on Iraj Amjadian, a student at the police
academy, when a mild quake shook the city as he and other
volunteers were trying to pull bodies from the debris of a
collapsed building.
   Fifty aftershocks struck Tuesday and Wednesday in Gilan
province, on the Caspian Sea, and Zanjan, just south, according to
Tehran University's Geophysics Center. More than 400 aftershocks
have hit since Thursday.
   Two field tribunals were being set up in northwestern Iran to
try ``criminals who are abusing the situation in the area,'' IRNA
said.
   The agency did not elaborate, but appeared to refer either to
looters or profiteers operating after the quake. The agency said
the courts would be set up in Rudbar and Manjil.
   At a news conference in Tehran, the managing director of Iran's
Red Crescent societies said survivors were being housed in more
than 70,000 tents sent to the region, IRNA reported.
   Mohammad Parham said 175 foreign planes airlifted thousands of
tons of supplies, including medical aid, tents and other items. He
praised the foreign relief effort and said 500 foreign doctors and
relief workers were in the area.
   He said relief operations were approaching the final stages and
that there was no need for additional foreign doctors and relief
workers, IRNA reported.
   ``The need for foreign doctors and rescuers was acute only in
the first 72 hours. Now, the need is for medicines and shelter
equipment,'' said Seyfollah Vahid Dastjerdi, the Red Crescent chief.
   The first plane carrying Iraqi relief supplies arrived
Wednesday. Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war, which was halted
by a cease-fire in 1988.
   Foreign aid has come from more than 26 countries, including
sworn enemies like the United States, Britain, Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.
   That has prompted a bitter debate among Iranian leaders.
Radicals say the donations should not lead to improved relations
with the West, and others who say they should.
   Radical members of parliament oppose ties with the West.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani supports better ties with the outside
world.
   Some Western diplomats say the quake and resulting international
aid effort could lead to better diplomatic ties.
   ``Of course the goodwill gesture being shown by France and other
countries will have favorable effects in future relations of these
countries with Iran,'' French Minister for Humanitarian Action
Bernard Kouchner said in an interview published Wednesday in the
Tehran Times.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush Headed To Court With Owl Plans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three congressmen said Wednesday that the Bush
administration's scaled-down plan to protect the northern spotted
owl will force a court battle that will paralyze logging in the
Pacific Northwest.
   ``The president is leading us right down the road and into a
legal disaster,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn. and chairman of
the House Interior Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands.
   ``The administration is putting us right back in court _ right
back into paralysis in that area,'' he said.
   Echoed Rep Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ``I think there are serious
questions as to whether BLM can scientifically justify its
position. I sense BLM is wide open to a lawsuit.''
   And Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said the administration was
``flying in the face of the scientific evidence. All they are going
to do is precipitate lawsuits.''
   At issue is the administration's plan, announced Tuesday, to
save the owl, placed on the endangered species list last week, with
far milder reductions in the timber harvest than environmentalists
had said were needed.
   The administration says it can protect the shy, two-foot-tall
owl by reducing timber harvest levels from federal Bureau of Land
Management forests from 950 million board feet annually to 750
million board feet.
   The administration's plan, announced by BLM Director Cy Jamison,
will cost an estimated 1,000 jobs over two years, compared with the
government's prediction of an 8,000-job loss this decade under an
earlier plan by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas.
   Congressional and environmentalist critics of the plan charged
the administration was ignoring evidence that current forest
management practices are inadequate to reverse shrinking-habitat
and declining-population trends jeopardizing the owl's survival.
   Environmentalists say Northwest timber harvests must be cut
nearly in half to ensure that the owl will survive.
   Vento said he was also angry about Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter's decision to postpone a more complete plan for protecting
the owl until a newly formed task force can present to President
Bush, by Sept. 1, a comprehensive proposal for protecting the bird
while pursuing maximum timber harvests on Forest Service lands.
   ``The president ought to get off the fence instead of passing
the buck to another blue-ribbon committee,'' Vento said.
   Wyden said Bush has avoided a detailed response because he wants
to please both environmentalists and the timber industry.
   ``At some point you cannot pretend to have it all ways. You look
at this and you get the feeling the administration is taking the
position like somebody at a smorgasbord that just wants to eat it
all. You can't. You have to make some tough choices,'' Wyden said.
   Environmentalists said the BLM's proposal is illegal because it
does not adhere to the most modern, comprehensive scientific
information, as required by the Endangered Species Act.
   ``This is voodoo biology,'' said Andy Kerr, conservation
director for the Oregon Natural Resources Council.
   Even before Tuesday's announcement, environmental groups said
they would likely challenge in court any action short of what they
were proposing.

   Mikhail Baryshnikov will dance in the United
States for the first time this year during an 18-city tour starting
Oct. 24, it was announced Wednesday.
   The tour will be called the White Oak Dance Project. Dances,
including two new ones, will be by modern dance choreographer Mark
Morris.
   During his tenure as artistic director of American Ballet
Theatre, Baryshnikov invited Morris to create the ballet ``Drink to
Me Only with Thine Eyes,'' to music by Virgil Thomson. Baryshnikov
danced in it.
   After he left Ballet Theatre last fall, Baryshnikov went to
Brussels where the Mark Morris Dance Group has its headquarters to
dance in Morris' ``Wonderland,'' to music by Arnold Schoenberg. Ron
Besserer, who danced in that and has danced with Martha Clarke and
Lar Lubovitch, will be on the tour.
   Other dancers on the tour will be Peggy Baker and Nancy Colahan
from the Lubovitch company, Jamie Bishton of Ballet Theatre, Kate
Johnson from the Paul Taylor Dance Company and William Pizzuto and
Denise Pons of the Boston Ballet.
   The troupe will perform between Oct. 24 and Nov. 18 in Boston,
Minneapolis, Madison, Wis., Toledo, Columbus, Youngstown and
Dayton, Ohio, Charleston and Savannah, S.C., Jacksonville, Daytona
Beach, Miami and Tampa, Fla., East Lansing and Detroit, Mich.,
Louisville, Ky., and two cities to be announced.
   The sponsor will be Baryshnikov Productions and the Howard
Gilman Foundation. The dancers will be in a new dance center on the
grounds of Gilman's White Oak Plantation during July and August
rehearsals.

   A former judge was sentenced Wednesday in
his old courtroom to two to five years in prison for corruption
charges that included bullying court employees into feeding his
dogs and chopping wood.
   During a rambling, one-hour speech at the Cambria County
Courthouse, Joseph O'Kicki maintained his innocence, quoting Isaac
Newton, Roman and Buddhist philosophers, a former U.S. Supreme
Court justice and a state penitentiary inmate. He did not apologize
for the crimes he was convicted of Dec. 16, 1989.
   ``You violated a sacred trust,'' visiting Senior Judge Richard
Grifo of Northampton County told him. ``You have tainted the entire
judiciary with a broad brush.''
   O'Kicki was convicted on six counts. They included improperly
soliciting a lawyer for a $500 loan that never was repaid, asking
for $500 from an aide who was promised a promotion never granted,
and making court aides, clerks and secretaries perform personal
chores.
   Two secretaries told investigators O'Kicki summoned them to his
chambers, where they found him wearing only underwear _ once bikini
briefs, the other time yellow briefs.
   O'Kicki, 59, was removed from his $80,000-a-year post and denied
a state judicial pension. Grifo also fined O'Kicki $57,500 and
ordered him to reimburse the state about $140,000 in salary he
received since being suspended from the bench Oct. 11, 1988.
   Grifo allowed the former judge to remain free on $10,000 bond
pending an appeal, which O'Kicki's attorney said would be filed.
   Preate spokesman Mike Moyle said O'Kicki will be eligible for
parole after serving two years.

   Read my lips? Yo, George, read this. President Bush's flip-flop
on his hallmark campaign pledge of ``no new taxes'' is generating
more heat than a summer hot spell in Death Valley.
   Taxes and the hot air of broken political promises provided a
combustible mix for people in the street, radio talk show callers,
headline writers and late night comics.
   ``I think all politicians have some little white lies in them,''
said Peter Sienkowski, 52, a Dallas Republican.
   WABC Talk Radio in New York City played Bush's oft-repeated
campaign pledge with his Tuesday statement that reducing the
federal deficit would need ``tax revenue increases.'' The
about-face prompted a torrent of calls.
   ``How many times have we heard that phrase, `read my lips?'''
wondered Paulette Pettit of WABC. ``There wasn't passion or anger
among callers. It was more a feeling of, `I can't believe I fell
for that line.'''
   Ted O'Brien of WRKO in Boston, home of defeated Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, said the phone lines
sizzled Wednesday.
   ``It was THE topic,'' O'Brien said. ``There is a sense of
disappointment among his supporters. Those on the other side had a
sense of let him twist slowly in the wind. And there were those who
said the Duke would have done it 14 months earlier.''
   Headline writers had a field day.
   ``Read My Lips...I Lied!'' said the New York Post on its front
page. Inside was this line: ``Read His Forked Tongue.''
   The New York Daily News offered: ``Bush's Lips Say The `T'
Word.''
   The Times-Picayune in New Orleans had this: ``Re-Read My Lips,
Bush Says: Taxes Must Increase After All.''
   ``Late Night'' comic David Letterman on Wednesday's show listed
the top 10 other campaign promises Bush has broken. His list
included a birthday joyride on the stealth bomber for every U.S.
citizen, going 10 rounds with Dukakis at Trump Plaza, adding a
mechanical shark to the White House tour and, number one, the nude
Elvis postage stamp.
   Bush's new pitch flopped in Peoria, where the president was
pilloried.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Marsha Barnes of that Illinois
community. ``He's just like all the rest. They promise you
something, then they get in office and break their word. I won't
believe him in the future.''
   ``He's a liar,'' said Susan Russell, a resident of the Illinois
city. ``I never did believe that `read my lips' stuff and now I
think all that publicity about his loving family was a lot of
baloney.''
   Robert Miller, a Peoria Republican who voted for Bush, said the
president's change of heart was predictable if not well-received.
``Don't they all break their promises once they get in office?'' he
said.
   Indeed, Bush's turnabout didn't come as that much of a surprise.
   In a May 30 Gallup Poll, 74 percent of the respondents said Bush
would not be able to keep his pledge of no new taxes.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll of May 14 showed 49 percent of
the respondents said Bush should drop his promise and consider
raising taxes to reduce the federal deficit. Thirty-eight percent
said he should keep his word.
   And who pays will have a big impact on how any tax increase is
received.
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll last month said 68 percent
of the respondents favor high taxes for the rich.
   Pollsters say Bush's credibility hinges on whether the public
sees the switch as a change of direction or the cold reality that
taxes are needed to cut the deficit.
   ``How people read the economy is the important context on how
this decision will be read,'' said Andy Kohut of Princeton Survey
Research. ``Our surveys show a willingness to pay more in targeted
areas, such as health care, the war on drugs, the environment.''
   Some of Bush's supporters grudgingly said he had no choice.
   ``He wouldn't have done it unless his back was up against the
wall. When he said no new taxes, I think he was sincere at the
time,'' said Laurie Ashcraft, 45, a Chicago marketing research
manager.
   ``I think the guy's got some savvy for being able to recognize
the situation and having guts to go against what he said earlier,''
said Jon Simon, 29, of Boston. ``I applaud him for it. He finally
took a stand and wasn't afraid to contradict himself.''
   But no reasonings appeased Chago Saldana, 67, the owner of a
tire shop in Rio Hondo, Texas, a community of 2,000 residents near
the Mexican border. Said Saldana, ``It's a bunch of bull.''

<NOTE>EDS: SUBS grafs 1-2 to CORRECT to subcommittee sted committee,
UPDATE with final passage; picks up 3rd graf pvs bg'ng, Rep. David
Obey, ...,</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House foreign aid
subcommittee said Wednesday he will support cuts in aid to Israel
next year if its government persists in expanding settlements in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The blunt warning came as the House, approving a $15.7 billion
foreign aid bill, narrowly voted to preserve President Bush's
policy of not sending U.S. aid to international family planning
groups linked to abortion and agreed to keep money flowing to
Cambodia's non-communist resistance. The vote on final passage was
308 to 117.
   Rep. David Obey, treading on a subject seldom mentioned openly
in Washington, said he meant the comments as ``a very friendly
warning'' intended to ``avoid long-term tragedy and a mountain of
death'' in the increasingly unstable region.
   ``If Israel expands their settlements in any way, or if they add
a single new settlement, I will make a flat commitment to support
any request made by the administration to reduce aid to Israel in
next year's bill,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said. He was opening
debate on a $15.8 billion foreign aid bill for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   Obey's statement set him on a collision course with the newly
installed right-wing Israeli government, which has promised to
expand settlements in the territories seized in the 1967 six-day
war.
   Obey said the amount of any aid cuts would be based on how much
is spent on creating new settlements or expanding present ones.
   ``Israel is a sovereign nation and has the right to do anything
they want. But the U.S. government has no obligation to fund,
either directly or indirectly, settlements which we believe to be
an impediment to the peace process,'' he said.
   The bill before the House included $3 billion in military and
economic aid to Israel, which traditionally has been the largest
single foreign recipient of U.S. largesse. A separate measure
passed earlier this year included an additional $400 million in
loan guarantees to build housing in Israel for Soviet Jewish
emigres.
   Ariel Sharon, the housing minister of the new Israeli
government, has said Israel will not settle any of the Soviet
emigres in the West Bank or Gaza, and Obey welcomed that promise as
a positive step. But his threat to cut aid applied to any
settlement, whether by emigres or others.
   On the population issue, the House voted 224 to 198 to send $3
million through private groups for family planning and other health
projects in Romania, whose people have for decades been subject to
a government policy against contraception.
   But the amendment, offered by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,
specifically excluded from participation two groups _ the United
Nations Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood
Federation _ which participate in abortion counseling, referral or
services.
   Smith's opponents argued that those two groups are the only ones
which now operate in Romania, so barring them would make any aid
program for that country ineffective. But Smith and allies
countered that Bush would veto any bill that included funding for
the two abortion-linked agencies.
   The lawmakers also adopted, 260 to 162, an amendment by Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., to provide $7 million in non-lethal aid to
the coalition opposing Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government.
That replaced language in the bill barring any aid to the
resistance, a prohibition supported by members who feared the
dominance of the Khmer Rouge in the coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in the 1970s and were responsible
for the deaths of more than 1 million people in what have come to
be known as ``the killing fields.'' They are the strongest military
faction in a coalition which also receives millions of dollars in
covert U.S. military aid.
   Solarz argued that the money is needed to keep pressure on the
government to reach a peaceful settlement, and House Foreign
Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said it would
maintain ``at least the figment, if not the reality, of a third
force'' in the country.
   The bill is the principal vehicle for U.S. military, economic
and development aid to friends and allies around the globe. This
year's version begins what Obey has called a planned 5-year
transition away from a past emphasis on military aid and toward
economic support.
   Citing reduced East-West tensions and an end to the Cold War,
the House Appropriations Committee included new money for emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe, refugee and children's programs, and
development in Africa and Latin America. To pay for the increases,
the panel cut nearly $400 million from President Bush's military
aid request.
   The Bush administration agreed to support the bill on the House
floor, with the understanding that it would work when the measure
goes to the Senate to soften the military aid cut and other
provisions it objects to.
   High on the list of White House objections is language halving
military aid to El Salvador, expected to be about $85 million next
year, and applying conditions intended to keep the warring
government and leftist FMLN rebels at the peace table.
   Negotiations on a new bipartisan policy toward El Salvador are
being conducted separately between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and a team of House Democrats and Republicans.

<HEAD>Abortions Getting Harder to Find in Rural Areas, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion services are getting harder to find
in rural parts of the country and in some areas women have to
travel hundreds of miles to a provider, a report by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute said Wednesday.
   Nearly all of the nearly 1.6 million abortions performed in 1988
were performed in metropolitan areas. About 1.7 percent _ a total
of 27,000 _ took place in rural areas, according to the survey by
the independent, non-profit research group.
   In 1979, when 1.5 million abortions were performed in this
country, about 4.5 percent of them, around 67,000, were in rural
facilities.
   As the concentration of abortion services has continued to shift
from hospitals to specialized clinics, women in rural areas have
been hit hardest. Those women usually have had to rely on hospitals
for abortion services, since small clinics often are not economical
in rural areas, the report said.
   ``Our findings clearly show that access to abortion, which was
already a tremendous problem for women living outside of the
metropolitan areas of our country, is getting worse, even without
additional state restrictions that may result from any new
legislative activity,'' Stanley Henshaw, author of the report, said
in a statement released with it.
   In South Dakota, for example, women living in the western and
central parts of the state have to travel as far as 200 miles to
the nearest abortion provider, the report said.
   It said that because of the long distances, rural women are more
likely to have their abortion later in pregnancy when the health
risks are greater.

<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday issued an
arrest warrant for an army officer accused of destroying evidence
in the November massacre of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her
teen-age daughter.
   The warrant comes after widespread criticism of the
investigation by a U.S. congressional committee and leaders of El
Salvador's Roman Catholic Church.
   The charges accuse Lt. Col. Carlos Camilo Hernandez of
destroying the mission logs of troops accused in the shootings at
Central American University.
   Hernandez, an executive officer of the elite Belloso Battalion
in San Salvador, is the former assistant director of the military
college where the troops were stationed.
   The warrant was issued by Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is handling
the politically charged investigation. It asks military officials
to arrest Hernandez and hand him over to the civilian court for
prosecution.
   Neither the armed forces press office nor the U.S. Embassy would
comment on the latest development in the Jesuit case.
   Defense attorney Joaquin Barahona said the judge based his
warrant on the testimony of several witnesses as well as statements
by Hernandez himself.
   Hernandez is the tenth person charged in the case.
   The director of the military college, Col. Guillermo Benavides;
three lieutenants; and five enlisted men have been charged with the
slayings.
   No Salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human
rights crime, despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forcesor President
Alfredo Cristiani's rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   To date, the only evidence presented against Benavides has been
that of other defendants, which is not admissible in Salvadoran
courts.
   However, a key military witness appeared before the judge
Wednesday in a closed hearing.
   Col. Carlos Armando Aviles, who reportedly blew the case open by
telling a U.S. military adviser who was responsible for the
slayings, arrived Wednesday in El Salvador from Taiwan, where he
had been sent for ``military training'' after the Jesuit massacre.
   ``Aviles is a key witness,'' a defense lawyer, requesting
anonymity, told The Associated Press. ``If he testifies to what he
has said unofficially, it will be overwhelming evidence against the
defendants.''
   Asked about the latest developments in the Jesuit case at a news
conference Wednesday, Cristiani would only comment: ``If the judge
thinks he has proof he should proceed according to the law.''
   The massacre took place amid a huge offensive by leftist rebels
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who have waged a
decade-long insurgency. Army positions at the college had come
under fire several times.
   The six priests and educators, their housekeeper and her
15-year-old daughter were roused from their sleep before dawn Nov.
16 and killed by troops of the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion.
   Two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said Benavides
issued an order to kill the priests.
   The investigation has moved slowly and there have been reports
that crucial evidence has been destroyed, that military witnesses
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying,
and that the true masterminds of the slayings were being protected.
   The far-right considered the left-leaning Jesuit academics
subversive because they blamed social injustice, rather than
international communist expansion, for El Salvador's revolution.
   The Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Central American
University and one of the region's most respected educators, was
one of those slain.
   The murders provoked an international outcry and calls from some
quarters in the U.S. Congress for sharp cuts in aid to El Salvador,
the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the hemisphere. Washington
currently sends El Salvador about $1 million a day in economic and
military aid.
   The money keeps this small nation and its powerful military
afloat. Cristiani has taken pains to assure U.S. officials there
will be a good-faith investigation and punishment of those
responsible.
   At least 72,000 people have died in the civil war, most of them
civilians.
   The government is also under pressure from the rebels to resolve
the Jesuit case. The rebels demanded army officers be made
accountable for rights abuses at the latest round of peace talks
that ended this week in Mexico.
   At his news conference, Cristiani said the talks, which produced
no substantive accords, were ``positive in the sense that there
were advances in the process of pacification.''

   Record breaking temperatures, both high and low, were set
Wednesday, and thunderstorms hit various parts of the nation.
   Miami cooled to 71 degrees during the morning and tied its
record low for for the date, set in 1968. San Diego and
Scottsbluff, Neb., reached 68 degrees, breaking the record for the
warmest low temperature for the date.
   On Wednesday afternoon in Southern California, highs ranged from
about 80 degrees at the beaches, to near 110 degrees at the Los
Angeles Civic Center, to 114 degrees in the inland valleys, and as
high as 122 across the lower deserts.
   The heat wave was expected to continue through Thursday across
western Texas and through Sunday in Southern California.
   The National Weather Service predicted that the heat wave will
move eastward, slowly, and temperatures will rise across much of
the nation during the weekend.
   Among the cities setting record highs for the date Wednesday:
Cheyenne, Wyo., where the 94-degree reading surpassed by one degree
the 1970 record; and Denver, which broke its record set in the same
year by six degrees, registering 102.
   That reading at Denver also tied the city's record high for
June; it was last reached in 1954.
   The usual summer thunderstorms grew during the morning. Storms
produced hail three-quarters of an inch in diamater near Elkhorn,
Wis., and Waseca, Minn., where winds gusted to 60 mph.
   By early afternoon, the showers and thunderstorms extended from
parts of Lower Michigan across northeast Illinois and southeast
Wisconsin, and from southeast Minnesota into north-central Iowa.
   They also struck parts of the Dakotas, Colorado, New Mexico,
Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the lower Texas Gulf
Coast.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms extended along the Florida
Panhandle coast, and central and southern Florida.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in parts of Alabama,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New York state
and across western New England.
   Wednesday morning's low for the nation was 36 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46 degrees
at Grand Marais, Minn., to 115 at Luke Air Force Base, west of
Phoenix.

<HEAD>Head of Criminal Division Resigning from Justice for Philadelphia
Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Justice Department's criminal
division, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., is resigning to join a
Philadelphia law firm, officials said Wednesday night.
   Dennis' resignation, expected to be announced Thursday, creates
another vacancy in the top echelons of the Justice Department,
which has been plagued by personnel difficulties in the last year.
   But officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Dennis's resignation as an assistant attorney general is unrelated
to recent turmoil on the staff of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Dennis, who has spent most of his career as a Justice Department
prosecutor, will become a senior partner at the prestigious
Philadelphia firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, said one official.
   ``This is for his personal and professional benefit,'' the
official said.
   Without disputing that, two sources familiar with the situation
said Dennis had grown frustrated with Thornburgh's
close-to-the-vest management style that centralized decision-making
in the attorney general's office. These sources spoke on condition
that they not be identified.
   Dennis, the first black to head the Justice Department's
criminal division, will join the national litigation section at the
firm
   Morgan, Lewis and Bockius has more than 600 lawyers in several
cities, including Washington.
   As a holdover from the Reagan administration, Dennis long had
plans to return to Philadelphia, where he was U.S. attorney for
five years before he became assistant attorney general in 1988,
officials said.
   He commutes daily by train from his home near Media, Pa., a
suburb southwest of Philadelphia.
   Last year, Dennis served as acting deputy attorney general as
well as head of the criminal division. As such he was the
highest-ranking black ever to serve in the department.
   Dennis, who officials said would remain on the job through
August, is the second top Justice Department official to resign in
the last two months.
   In May, Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer, the department's
No. 2 official, resigned amid great acrimony, later accusing
Thornburgh of mishandling an internal investigation of an
unauthorized news leak.
   Sources said Ayer was also frustrated because he had been frozen
out of policy-making decisions by the attorney general's top aides,
who worked for Thornburgh when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Several days after Ayer's resignation, Thornburgh resassigned
two top aides, spokesman David Runkel and chief of staff Robert S.
Ross Jr. in an attempt to counteract criticism that he was isolated
from the department and surrounded by political loyalists.
   The president nominated William P. Barr, assistant attorney
general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, to succeed Ayer
as deputy.
   Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation
hearing Wednesday that he was asked by Thornburgh to restore the
traditional lines of authority in the department.
   Barr said that post of executive assistant to the attorney
general, which had been Ross's job, was abolished. Barr said he now
reports directly to Thornburgh.
   The 40-year-old Barr, who is acting deputy attorney general,
told senators that all the Justice Department components now report
to the attorney general through him.
   When Ayer was deputy, some divisions and agencies reported to
Thornburgh, Barr said.
   Barr told lawmakers that Thornburgh's staff assumed more
responsiblities than the attorney general had intended because he
had difficulty recruiting top people in the waning days of the
Reagan administration.
   Personnel difficulties continued after Thornburgh was asked to
stay on as attorney general in the Bush administration.
   His first choice for deputy attorney general, Robert Fiske, was
rejected by conservatives because of involvement in the American
Bar Association's judicial screening committee.
   Barr told the committee that Thornburgh's staff continued to
retain many responsibilities because of the difficulty finding a
deputy.
   Beside's Barr's appointment, other nominations for vacant
Justice Department positions are pending in the Senate.
   The Senate is also considering the nomination of Michael Luttig
to succeed Barr as the department's legal counsel.
   Late last year, Carol Crawford, assistant attorney general in
charge of legislative affairs, resigned following a series of
bureaucratic turf wars. Lee Rawls has been nominated to head the
office.

   More than a thousand callers have flooded a
police hotline with reports they saw or spoke to the ``Zodiac
gunman,'' but none has produced a firm lead, police said Wednesday.
   Mayor David N. Dinkins has offered a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunman, who
has promised a death for each sign of the zodiac and already has
killed one man and wounded three others since March 8.
   Investigators on the Zodiac Task Force are using a sophisticated
computer system to keep track of the hotline calls.
   ``The computerized system enables us to do is make sure we
capture all the tips, all the information that comes in, and gives
us a chance to pull it up rapidly,'' said Police Commissioner Lee
P. Brown.
   ``You don't know which call you get or what piece of information
you get will be that which you need to bring resolution to the
cases,'' he added.
   The calls are checked and assigned a priority by supervisors and
``if there's a sign that something is really hot, that will be
dealt with immediately,'' Brown said.
   The most credible sounding tipsters are interviewed by
detectives. Investigators interviewed 18 callers on Wednesday, but
believed their reports were unfounded, said Chief of Detectives
Joseph Borrelli.
   Police and news organizations have received six notes from
someone claiming responsibility for the shootings. In one of the
notes, the writer threatened to kill 12 people _ one for each
astrological sign.
   Police have said they do not believe the gunman is connected to
the killer dubbed the ``zodiac'' who claimed responsibility for as
many as 40 killings in a series of notes sent to San Francisco-area
newspapers from 1968 to 1987.
   The latest shooting victim, Larry Parham, said he was questioned
about his birth date by a stranger a few days before he was shot in
Central Park. Parham's astrological sign _ Cancer _ was referred to
a letter left at the scene.
   However, another of the four victims said Wednesday that the
gunman, who was wearing a mask, said nothing to him before he
opened fire. This victim, whose spoke to WNBC-TV on condition of
anonymity, said he did not think the man knew his astrological sign.
   The police task force has grown to more than 50 investigators,
and they are consulting with ``people who have a knowledge of
astrology,'' Brown said.
   Brown was Atlanta's public safety commissioner and headed the
investigation of a series of child killings there in 1979 to 1981.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel on
Wednesday swore in Czechoslovakia's first democratically elected
government in more than four decades.
   Also Wednesday, the new Parliament elected as speaker of the
house Alexander Dubcek, leader of the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reforms that were crushed by Soviet-led troops. He had been
appointed interim speaker in December.
   The new 16-member government, headed by incumbent Premier Marian
Calfa, was formed in talks involving Havel's Civic Forum, its
Slovak ally Public Against Violence and the Christian Democratic
Movement.
   Civic Forum and Public Against Violence spearheaded November's
peaceful revolution that deposed the Communists who had ruled for
four decades. The two groups together won a majority in the
300-seat Parlament in June 8-9 elections.
   At the ceremony at Hradcany Castle, the seat of the president,
Calfa pledged to help lead Czechoslovakia out of the debris of the
Communist legacy, recalling the democratic tradition that prevailed
before Communist rule.
   ``We have a great past and we are in the ruins of the present.
Our task is to step over these ruins and lead Czechoslovakia on the
road to Europe, on the road toward prosperity,'' Calfa said.
   Havel reminded the new government of its responsibility.
   ``After long decades, you are the first government that has
emerged from free elections, a government born of the true will of
the people,'' Havel said.
   Several members of the interim Cabinet remained in the new
government.
   They included Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, economic
reformer Vladimir Dlouhy and Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek.
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus and Labor Minister Petr Miller also
retained their ministries.
   Dlouhy and Pavel Hoffmann, a Slovak economist, are to head new
ministries that will oversee planned radical economic reforms. A
third economist, Vaclav Vales, retained his post as deputy Prime
Minister and is to coordinate the transformation to a market
economy.
   One of the Parliament's first tasks will be to elect a new
President for a two-year term. Havel has been nominated for the
post but has said he would accept only if the government wins
Parliamentary support.
   In the new 300-seat legislature, Civic Forum and Public Against
Violence have 170 members. The Communists won 47 seats and the
third-strongest group, the Christian Democratic alliance, won 40
places.
   The House of Nations and the House of the People, the two
chambers of Parliament, met in joint session to elect a speaker and
presidium. Dubcek, who was chosen speaker, became a symbol of
reform during the November revolution.
   After initial resistance, the Christian Democratic Movement
agreed to join the government coalition. A government comprising
only the Civic Forum and Public Against Violence would have lacked
the three-fifths majority needed to push through constitutional
changes.
   Officials from both groups repeatedly stated they sought the
broadest possible coalition, but ruled out governing with the
Communists.
   The Slovak government, which was also appointed Wednesday, is
headed by Vladimir Meciar, a member of Public Against Violence.

<HEAD>Iranian-Backed Hezbollah Criticizes Saudi Royal Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah called
Wednesday for stripping the Saudi Arabian royal family of its role
as custodian of Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   The call came in a statement issued in Beirut to mark the third
anniversary of clashes in Mecca between Iranian pilgrims and Saudi
security forces in which more than 400 people were killed.
   Most of the victims were Iranian pilgrims staging anti-U.S.
demonstrations during pilgrimage rituals around the Kaaba, Islam's
most sacred shrine.
   Saudi Arabia has since introduced a quota system, curtailing the
number of pilgrims to Mecca. Tehran rejected the move and ordered a
boycott of the pilgrimage, which is considered a sacred duty that
all Moslems must perform at least once in their lifetimes.
   The Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God, is Iran's main
ally in Lebanon, the only country where the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's brand of Shiite fundamentalism has taken strong roots.
   ``On the third anniversary of Mecca's bloody massacre committed
by the Wahhabi rulers ... we stress that they must be stripped of
custodianship on the two most sacred shrines,'' Hezbollah's
statement said.
   The Saudi dynasty belongs to the Bedouin Wahhabi community, an
offshoot of the Sunni Moslem sect.
   The ruling family of Al-Saud traditionally holds trusteeship
over the Kaaba and the tomb of the Prophet Mohammed in Medina.

   ``Skeptical'' authorities on Wednesday
were investigating whether robbers who stole $10.8 million from an
armored truck may have had inside help.
   FBI agents and Monroe County sheriff's officials also said they
had found a van believed to have been used in Tuesday's robbery,
the biggest theft from an armored car in U.S. history.
   At least two gunmen held up the truck when the driver and guard
stopped to buy coffee and sandwiches shortly after leaving Armored
Motor Service of America's offices in the Rochester suburb of
Chili. The truck was on its way to the Federal Reserve Bank branch
in Buffalo with surplus cash from area banks.
   Lloyd's of London insurance companies are offering a $250,000
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the
robbers and recovery of the stolen money.
   The driver and guard, whose names have not been released, told
authorities they were bound, gagged and blindfolded while the
robbers transferred the cash to another vehicle.
   Both employees have been given lie-detector tests, the results
of which weren't released. One company official said their stop at
the convenience store violated company policy, but another official
denied there was such a policy.
   Sheriff Andrew P. Meloni said a gray van was found Wednesday
afternoon as the result of a telephone tip.
   ``We are certain it was used in the robbery,'' Meloni said at a
news conference. He would not say where the van was discovered or
what evidence connected it with the theft.
   One of the gunmen was wearing brown clothing ``similar to the
uniforms worn by the company that operated the truck,'' said FBI
Special Agent G. Robert Langford.
   ``We don't know if that means he was an employee or if the
uniform was used to gain access to the truck or to prevent him from
attracting a lot of attention.''
   The two employees, who were not injured, were questioned by
authorities for more than eight hours Tuesday, sheriff's department
spokesman Tom Ryan said.
   Ryan said authorities were ``skeptical'' about some of the
details of the story told by the driver and the guard.
   Meloni said ``we haven't ruled anybody in or out'' as a suspect.
   Teams of FBI agents and sheriff's officials interviewed current
and former AMSA employees Wednesday and searched for witnesses,
sheriff's Capt. Neil Flood said.
   ``Somebody's sitting on 1,500 pounds of money out there
somewhere,'' Flood said.
   Sheriff's deputies and FBI agents questioned customers and
passers-by outside the convenience store where the truck was held
up. Keith Frank, manager of the store, said the truck had stopped
there before _ sometimes as often as two or three times a week.
   Michael Bucci, executive vice president of AMSA, said the stop
was a violation of company policy. ``You don't stop,'' Bucci said.
``Absolutely not.''
   But George Clark, the company's controller, said Wednesday there
is no rule that absolutely prohibits stops.

   A blaze that killed six firefighters when
it flared like ``a big blowtorch'' spread Wednesday across 15,000
acres of Arizona's most verdant pine forest.
   A photographer who escaped the fatal firestorm Tuesday described
how he and others fled for their lives into a burned-out clearing.
   ``There wasn't much time for thinking, just survival,'' said
Chad Surmick. ``All of a sudden the trees around us started
bursting into flames. It was like Roman candles going up all over
the place.''
   The firefighters were killed and five others injured when a
``dry thunderstorm'' struck the area Tuesday, driving the fire
along the Mogollon Rim in all directions and trapping several
crews, said Jim Paxon, fire-information officer for the Gila
National Forest in New Mexico.
   ``It's just like a big furnace, a big blowtorch kind of
effect,'' Paxon said. ``It built its own thunderhead from the fire.
That was a 40,000-foot vertical column, five to six miles across.''
   The fire had destroyed about 50 houses and forced evacuation of
700 others by Wednesday.
   The dead firefighters were five inmates from the Perryville
state prison west of Phoenix and an administrative assistant to the
warden at the prison's San Pedro Unit, said corrections spokesman
Michael Arra. Four of the five injured firefighters also were
Perryville prisoners, while the fifth was from a Tucson fire
department.
   The inmates were participating in a 5-year-old volunteer
firefighting program which had never had a casualty, Arra said.
   Surmick, a photographer for the Mesa Tribune, was with six other
journalists and a number of firefighters ``when we started noticing
the fire getting closer and closer and the smoke was getting really
bad.''
   While he and others ran to a previously burned clearing, the
fire jumped the road behind them.
   ``As we were running up the hill, some of the TV guys were
trying to film,'' Surmick said. ``The firefighters were screaming
at them, `This is not the time to be filming; we are going to die
if you don't get up that hill.'''
   Surmick and the others were trapped in the clearing for about
three hours.
   Tanker planes and helicopters backed up as many as 1,500
firefighters and support personnel fighting the blaze in Tonto and
Coconino National Forests, which was ignited Monday by lightning.
Firefighters also had to contend with a heat wave that sent
temperatures soaring to an all-time record high of 106 degrees at
Payson, 13 miles to the southwest.
   Smoke billowing from 30-foot-high flames was so thick that
command stations repeatedly lost touch with firefighter crews.
   Payson was choked with smoke, and the smoke and ash reached as
far away as Show Low, 90 miles to the east.
   Tonto National Forest fire information officer Bob Celaya
estimated that nearly all of Bonita Creek Estates, a subdivision of
57 summer homes, had been destroyed. The subdivision was evacuated
Monday evening, and the residents of about 700 other threatened
homes were told to evacuate Tuesday.

   Democrats responding to President Bush's
endorsement of possible tax increases offered a plan Wednesday to
cut billions of dollars in benefit programs such as Social Security
and to raise taxes paid by some people covered by the retirement
program.
   Republican congressional leaders, meanwhile, faced a budding
rebellion over Bush's tax turnabout.
   White House and congressional negotiators searching for ways to
cut the 1991 federal deficit began discussing proposals in earnest,
a day after Bush said ``tax revenue increases'' are needed as part
of a plan to cut the deficit.
   Democrats, citing Bush's concession, offered a plan that one
participant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said totaled $5.6
billion in savings. Negotiators are seeking $45 billion to $60
billion in new taxes and spending cuts for fiscal year 1991, which
starts Oct. 1.
   Another official, also requesting anonymity, said the options
came to $10 billion. The official said one element was a
three-month delay in cost-of-living increases for benefit programs
for which people qualify automatically, such as Social Security
pensions for retired workers.
   Under that plan, the annual cost-of-living boosts would be
delayed from Jan. 1 to April 1 for a savings of $3 billion.
   The official said the suggestion for delaying cost-of-living
adjustments ran into objections from Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill. Rostenkowski said the political consequences of such a delay
would be ``death,'' the official said.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said the Democratic package included
reductions in Medicare and federal employee benefit programs.
Sasser also said the plan would increase from 50 percent to 85
percent the amount of Social Security benefits subject to federal
taxes for couples whose incomes exceed $32,000 annually. The tax
boost would raise $3.1 billion next year.
   ``We're trying to be even-handed about it, tit-for-tat,'' said
Sasser. ``They're talking about taxes, and we're talking about
reducing entitlements,'' the bureaucratic term for benefit programs.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
negotiators generally agreed that their goal should be to achieve a
balanced budget by 1995. The Gramm-Rudman law requires the deficit
to be eliminated by 1993, a goal that virtually everyone in
Washington believes cannot be achieved.
   ``It's fair to assume ... the targets are going to be changed,''
Domenici said of the series of declining annual deficit goals set
by Gramm-Rudman.
   In seven weeks of meetings, only one proposal had been advanced,
a $51 billion deficit-reduction package offered last week by White
House budget director Richard Darman. It was quickly dismissed by
Democrats as insufficient.
   But Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said after emerging from the
Wednesday morning session of closed-door bargaining, ``The whole
tenor has changed. It is very determined. It doesn't seem to be as
acrimonious. It's, `How do we get there?'''
   Some other Republicans, not part of the negotiations, didn't
feel that way.
   ``The president may well go into a back room somewhere and sign
off on this deal, but Republicans haven't,'' said Rep. Bob Walker,
R-Pa., who led a letter-writing campaign in the House against any
tax increase.
   Negotiators said there was no attempt during Wednesday morning's
meeting to learn what taxes Bush was referring to.
   But outside the Capitol meeting room where negotiators met,
Democrats and Republicans grappled for political advantage over
Bush's statement. The president said Tuesday that spending cuts,
changes in the budget process and a cut in the capital gains tax
rate _ which everyone agrees would increase revenues, atleast
initially _ were also required to shrink a budget gap that could
surpass $200 billion next year.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp told reporters that revenues can
come from many sources, including a growing economy, new federal
fees or taxes on tobacco.
   ``It certainly didn't violate, in my view, any pledge,'' Kemp
said.
   But many rank-and-file Republicans, counting on the subject of
taxes as a campaign issue against Democrats, were pained by Bush's
retreat from his promise of ``no new taxes.''
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., collected the signatures of 12 of the
Senate's 45 Republicans on a letter saying the deficit must be
controlled ``through spending reductions and economic growth, not
through tax increases.''
   On Tuesday, 90 of the 176 House Republicans signed a similar
note.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, one of the administration's
budget negotiators, turned aside questions about Republican anger
over the president's announcement.
   ``All of us in the budget process have a very strong commitment
to the fact that sniping and private opinions from the sidelines to
gain political advantage are not going to help this process,''
Brady said.
   ``I feel the president's actions yesterday were an exercise in
leadership. That is why the American people elected him and I am
sure they are going to look at it that way,'' Brady told reporters
at the White House.
   Democratic leaders said they remained unconcerned about the
petitions, saying unhappy lawmakers might change their minds if tax
increases were part of a solid deficit-reduction package that
included spending cuts.
   ``I'm not going to write it off today,'' House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., said of the prospects for passage of a budget deal.
   The Democratic Study Group, a liberal research arm of the
House's Democrats, released a letter to Foley insisting any tax
increases be levied on people with annual incomes greater than
$200,000 annually. The petition, circulated last month, was signed
by 134 House Democrats.
   ``Working and middle-class families have fought for a decade
against declining wages while their tax burden has gone up,'' the
letter said.

   Two helicopters carrying journalists
collided Wednesday afternoon as they were returning from a Contra
demobilization ceremony in the countryside. A witness said several
were badly injured.
   ``In all the years I've covered the war, I've never felt so
close to death,'' said Ernesto Mejia, an Associated Press
photographer aboard one of the helicopters. ``It seemed unreal, to
end the war almost dying.''
   There were unofficial reports at least 14 people had been
hospitalized. A spokesman for the presidential press office said
authorities were still compiling a list of the injured several
hours after the crash.
   Mejia said 24 journalists were on board the two helicopters when
they collided at 2:15 p.m. as they were taking off from San Pedro
de Lovago, a village where Contra commanders had turned over their
weapons to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in a ceremony
marking the end of the civil war.
   The journalists were evacuated to Managua, about 100 miles away,
in helicopters from the United Nations-Organization of American
States force overseeing the Contra demobilization.
   ``When we reached an altitude of about 15 meters (yards), the
nose of our helicopter dropped and we hit the other MI-17 as it was
taking off,'' Mejia said. ``We felt a terrible impact and then we
were on the ground, some of our comrades crying.
   ``After getting out as best we could, we saw that the other
helicopter had fallen about 200 meters (yards) away,'' he said.
   Mejia said he and eight other reporters were in one helicopter
and 15 were in the second.
   ``We could see that Barricada reporter Guillermo Cortes was
unconscious and we told the OAS people, who got him out. Seconds
later, the helicopter caught on fire and burned to a crisp.''
   Mejia said there were three reporters from Nicaraguan national
television on his helicopter along with freelance photographer
Arturo Robles, two reporters for Barricada, the Sandinista party
newspaper, and two photographers from the presidential press office.
   Mejia said the other helicopter, which was carrying 15
journalists, did not burn but most of its occupants appeared
injured.
   Mejia said Agence France Press reporter Lidia Hunter, a
Nicaraguan, and AFP photographer Bruno Martina, an Italian,
appeared badly injured and were taken to the military hospital in
Managua.
   A Univision cameraman appeared to have suffered serious injuries
in both legs and was unable to move, Mejia said.
   Peter Northall, a photographer for Agence France Press, said he
suffered only minor injuries in the crash.
   A third helicopter carrying journalists made the flight to
Managua safely, Mejia said.

   The Legislature gave final approval
Wednesday night to the strictest state abortion bill in the nation
and passed it along to Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has promised a veto.
   The bill calls for prison terms of up to 10 years hard labor for
doctors who perform abortions, and offers no exceptions for women
who wish to abort fetuses that are the product of rape or incest.
   The bill's sponsors hope to use it to challenge the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion rights.
Roemer has 10 days to act, and the legislative session ends in 12
days.
   Roemer and abortion rights advocates predicted Wednesday that
the Legislature would sustain Roemer's promised veto
   The House passed the final version by a 80-23 vote Wednesday
night, accepting amendments the Senate had added to clarify that
abortion would be allowed to save the life of the mother.
   The Senate Tuesday passed the bill by 24-15, two votes shy of
the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
   ``I believe the vote yesterday in the Senate showed that there
will be sufficient votes to sustain the veto. But that will be
their decision,'' Roemer said at a news conference.
   ``We have the votes to sustain both in the Senate and in the
House,'' said Robin Rothrock, leader of a coalition of state
abortion-rights groups. ``I'm feeling great.''
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, the bill's author, met with Roemer privately
for more than an hour Wednesday, but they failed to reach a
compromise, Jenkins said.
   Wedndesday's House vote, and a 74-27 vote on a version of the
bill last week, provided margins large enough for an override. But
anti-abortion lawmakers have conceded privately that they might not
be able to carry all those votes to override.
   Louisiana legislative historians say there is no record of a
veto being overridden this century.
   At his news conference, Roemer reiterated his opposition to
abortion on demand and criticized groups who have threatened
economic boycotts of the state if an anti-abortion law is adopted.
   In California Tuesday, the president of the Los Angeles chapter
of the National Organization for Women said the chapter is drafting
a resolution calling for a boycott of all tourism and conventions
in Louisiana, to be considered at NOW's annual meeting beginning
Friday in San Francisco.
   ``These same women criticize others for having narrow
fundamental views and then I see these kinds of threats. I don't
like it,'' Roemer said.
   But the governor said Louisiana abortion law must have rape and
incest exceptions.
   ``If we cannot give some credence and faith and hope and
constructive opportunity to the victims of those crimes then I
don't think that this bill should be signed by me and will be
vetoed,'' he said.
   Jenkins said the exceptions could easily be used by women
falsely claiming to be rape victims to get a legal abortion.
   He also said such exceptions would contradict past Louisiana
abortion law, a 19th century measure that included no exceptions.
Such inconsistency would weaken the state's case should the bill
reach the Supreme Court, Jenkins said.
   ``That's just absolute self-serving foolishness,'' responded
Roemer, who said he used to oppose exceptions but changed his mind.
   Although several states have adopted strict anti-abortion laws
in the past year since the Supreme Court upheld a restrictive
Missouri abortion law, none has attempted to outlaw all abortions.
   Idaho's legislature passed a bill outlawing abortion except in
some cases of rape, incest, fetal deformity or a threat to the life
or health of the woman. But that measure was vetoed by Gov. Cecil
Andrus in March.
   Also in March, the U.S. territory of Guam approved a law that
makes it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion and a
misdemeanor for a woman to have an abortion; it makes an exception
in cases in which the woman's life is threatened. That law is on
hold while it is challenged in court.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld Minnesota and Ohio laws
requiring minors to notify their parents or a judge before having
an abortion.

<TEXT>
   Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco became
baseball's first $5 million man and its highest paid player
Wednesday when he agreed to a 5-year deal worth $23.5 million.
   The contract moved him ahead of the Yankees' Don Mattingly, who
in April signed a 5-year, $19.6 million deal.
   ``I don't think it's what I'm worth,'' Canseco said at
Wednesday's news conference. ``It's what the market holds, what the
organizations are willing to pay a player.
   ``The popularity I have, whether it's controversial or positive,
people want to come out and see Jose Canseco play.''
   The A's, shooting for a third straight trip to the World Series,
will pay Canseco $5.1 million in 1995, the final year of his new
deal.
   He will collect a $3.5 million signing bonus, $2.8 million in
1991, $3.6 million in 1992, $4.1 million in 1993, and $4.4 million
in 1994.
   There are incentives, too. If Canseco is named the American
League's Most Valuable Player, he'll collect $100,000. An MVP in
the playoffs and World Series is each worth another $50,000.
   The 25-year-old Canseco will earn $2 million in salary for this
season.
   Oakland general manager Sandy Alderson said signing Canseco was
necessary if the team was sincere about ``retaining the
competitiveness and identity of the Oakland A's into the 1990s.''
   He also said ``There's no question that our payroll is reaching
the point of some limitation.''
   Although he has missed 14 games because of back problems and
another two due to a sore right wrist, Canseco has hit 20 home runs
with 50 RBIs and a .307 average in 55 games this season.
   Canseco was voted the AL's MVP in 1988, when he became the first
player to better the 40-home run and 40-steal plateau in the same
year. He earned $325,000 that year.

<TEXT>
   A University of Maryland nuclear
engineering professor Wednesday denied allegations that he sexually
abused his daughter for more than 16 years.
   Frank J. Munno, 54, was indicted Tuesday by a Prince George's
County grand jury on felony charges after Angela Mattson told
authorities her father sexually abused her from the third grade
through graduate school.
   ``I'm pleading not guilty because I'm not guilty,'' Munno said
in a telephone interview from his College Park home.
   ``Shocked and outraged would be the words to describe the
feelings I'm trying to keep inside,'' he said. ``My family is
supportive and very disappointed.''
   Mattson, 28, an engineer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
said she spoke out because she hoped to help other victims of abuse.
   ``I've learned it's sometimes easier to explain what happened
than to keep it a dark secret,'' she told The Washington Post in
Wednesday's editions.
   ``What I'm hoping is that there's a potential abuser out there
who's going to see this and realize that his daughter's going to
grow up to do something, press charges,'' she said. ``And maybe, he
won't go into her bedroom.''
   Munno, a tenured, $89,000-a-year professor, heads the nuclear
engineering program on the College Park campus, the largest in the
University of Maryland system. He has been at College Park for 32
years.
   He said he would not take a leave from his teaching position.
``Why would I be any worse a teacher because I was accused?'' Munno
said.
   The grand jury charged Munno with incest, child abuse, unlawful
carnal knowledge, and unnatural and perverted sex practices. He
faces a maximum of 15 yers in prison, if convicted on all the
charges.
   Munno is scheduled for arraignment July 13 on the child abuse
charge, authorities said.
   Mattson said in an interview with WRC-TV that sending her father
to prison is not her goal.
   ``I wanted to have my day in court and to have other people in
my position to realize that they can get better, that there is help
out there,'' she said.
   Her father's manipulation prevented her from pressing charges
sooner, she said Wednesday.
   ``I couldn't even get up the courage to leave the house,'' she
said. ``Even when I stopped the abuse my father was still able to
make me feel guilty enough to stay at home. And in the last few
years, it's been a slowly evolving process _ one of my own
strength, my own independence.''
   When asked if she loved her father, Mattson haltingly replied,
``I wish I had a father. I have come to the point where I need to
feel that I don't have a father. A father couldn't have done what
he did and continue treating me the way he is.''
   In a statement, university officials said they cannot take
action against Munno solely on the basis of indictments. Officials
will assess the situation when the facts become available.
   ``I think the statement says they're waiting for the facts,
which is refreshing in this society,'' Munno said.

   Ex-model Rasheeda Moore testified Wednesday
that she used cocaine, marijuana and opium with Marion Barry ``over
100 times'' and that the mayor once told her he was addicted to
cocaine.
   Testifying in Barry's drug and perjury trial, the woman who
cooperated with the FBI in the mayor's arrest said they had a
sexual relationship and shared drugs between 1986 and 1988. She
said Barry once slapped her to the floor after using drugs.
   ``It was an intimate relationship, and we used drugs together,''
said Moore.
   Barry watched the 39-year-old Moore with a stony stare as she
described their relationship. Barry's wife, Effi, smiled as Moore
took the witness stand but wore a grim expression as the witness
detailed allegations of sex and drug use.
   Moore said Barry was an experienced drug user who baked powdered
cocaine into crack.
   ``After he baked it, we smoked it,'' Moore testified.
   And she said that after smoking crack cocaine in one session,
Barry ``said he was addicted to cocaine. He said he wanted to
quit.''
   Prosecutors were expected to use her testimony to introduce as
evidence an FBI videotape of the Jan. 18 night when Barry allegedly
smoked crack cocaine while visiting Moore at a Washington hotel
room.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use. One possession charge stems from the sting in which the
three-term mayor was arrested.
   Moore described an affair that ranged from sex and violence to
talks of spirituality, but which always included drugs. She told
the court she and Barry used drugs ``at least over 100 times.''
   ``There were times we would do it more than once a day,
sometimes two or three times a week,'' she continued.
   ``Sometimes he would stop by before work, sometimes after
hours,'' Moore said.
   Speaking in a low and even voice, Moore described how she and
the mayor used drugs, including cocaine powder, crack cocaine,
marijuana and opium, at a dozen places around Washington.
   She said Barry became violent after one session at a Washington
hotel in which they smoked crack cocaine through a homemade pipe
Barry assembled from aluminum foil and a large spoon. The mayor
accused her of having a relationship with another man and ``slapped
me,'' Moore said.
   She returned the slap, she said, but ``ended up on the floor''
when Barry slapped her again.
   ``I haven't hit a woman in 20 years,'' she said Barry told her.
``You bring the worst out in a man.''
   She said they also used drugs at:
   _Barry's home. Moore testified she and Barry cooked cocaine
powder and smoked it while Barry's wife and son were away from the
house.
   _Moore's mother's home. She said she and Barry smoked crack
cocaine there several times, including Dec. 22, 1988, the day
Barry's visits to the hotel room of convicted drug dealer Charles
Lewis were made public. Barry once smoked so much cocaine in the
house, ``I had to hold him up. Afterward, he said, `That was a
really great hit.'''
   _The Virginia home of Bishop H.H. Brookins, the leader of more
than 300 African Methodist-Episcopal congregations in the region.
She said she began to pass out there after smoking crack cocaine
and cried out, ``Marion, Marion.'' But, she said, the mayor turned
off the bathroom light and left, telling her later, ``I couldn't do
anything, there was nothing I could do.''
   ``I could have died,'' she told the court.
   The bishop said in statement he had never met Ms. Moore as far
as he knew and if what she described actually happened, ``it would
be a violation of the sanctity of my home, of my trust and of my
friendship.''
   After another crack-smoking episode, Barry said he was addicted
to cocaine and ``talked to me for the first time about developing
his spiritual side. He was tired, he wanted to get his life
together, he talked about starting to go to church,'' said Moore.
   They were smoking together one Sunday in 1987, Moore testified,
when ``I told him, this is Mother's Day, aren't you going to spend
time with your family? He told me, `I am, but I have some time
after church.'''
   Moore said Barry often become paranoid, and once sent her out to
see if someone was watching them from a van parked outside the
townhouse where they were using cocaine. Barry had a series of
hiding places where he stashed the drug, including a vacuum cleaner
bag, Moore added.
   Moore testified she first tried to hide her use of crack cocaine
from the mayor because she ``didn't want the burden of guilt of
introducing it to him.''
   But, she said, Barry told her he was experienced with
``freebasing'' _ or smoking cocaine _ when he found a crack pipe in
her apartment.
   ``Before the night was out, we had freebased, we had done
crack,'' she said.
   At the time, Moore ran a youth modeling program for the city,
and she testified that Barry helped her get the contract for the
program. She estimated the contract was worth $180,000.
   Moore said she ended her sexual relationship with Barry in June
1988 ``because there was so much drug use over that period of
time.''
   But ``once we stopped the intimate relationship, we continued
using drugs,'' Moore testified.
   At a bench conference, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin
said Moore has been in the government's witness protection program
since Jan. 29 because of death threats. Retchin claimed that there
is a $100,000 contract out on Moore's life, but that there is no
evidence Barry had anything to do with the threat.

<HEAD>Flaw Found In Focus Of $1.5 Billion Hubble Space Telescope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A focusing flaw that cannot be repaired from
the ground has been found in the Hubble Space Telescope, leaving
some instruments unworkable until a repair shuttle mission can be
flown, NASA announced Wednesday.
   Many of the spectacular views of the universe that scientists
hoped to get with the $1.5 billion Hubble instrument will not be
possible now until a maintenance mission scheduled for 1993 is
completed, officials said.
   NASA said it would try to fly the repair mission earlier.
   Engineers discovered the flaw when they attempted to fine-tune
the focus between the primary and the secondary mirrors aboard the
orbiting telescope.
   Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier said ``there was no
single one point...with a crisp, clean image.''
   Further study determined that there was a fundamental flaw that
may have been built in when the mirrors were manufactured, Olivier
said during a news conference.
   Jack Rehnberg, the chief of the space science program at Hughes
Danbury Optical of Danbury Conn., manufacturer of the flawed
mirrors, said the cause may have been human error during an
extensive testing program while the mirrors were being made.
   ``We don't know the cause, but its probably something
inherently, fundamentally not done right,'' he said. ``It could
have been a human error.''
   The mistake, he said, could have come with equipment that
checked the polished mirror surface. NASA has said that tests
showed that Hubble's 94-inch primary mirror is the smoothest large
mirror ever made.
   ``We could have erred in the assembly of some of the test
equipment and it didn't get picked up even though we've had lots of
reviews, and checks and rechecks,'' said Rehnberg.
   The space agency has named Lew Allen, director of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, to head a team investigating the Hubble
problem. Rehnberg said he has selected a team of engineers from his
company to help.
   NASA scientist Ed Weiler said the problem degrades the focus
possible with several instruments aboard the orbiting telescope,
particularly two cameras designed to take pictures in visible light
of very faint and distant stars.
   He said a faint object camera, provided to the Hubble project by
the European Space Agency, will not be able to take pictures of a
quality any better than a ground-based telescope.
   A wide field camera, which was used to take the first photos
from the Hubble released to the public, will be virtually useless
until the telescope can be repaired.
   ``There is no real science we can do with it at this time,'' he
said.
   Three instruments that can study stars by gathering ultraviolet
and infrared radiation will not be as seriously affected, Weiler
said. But he noted that one of these instruments, the high speed
photometer, will be about to collect ``about half of the science''
that had been planned.
   The Hubble was placed in a 281-mile high orbit by space shuttle
Discovery on April 25. Engineers have spent the time since trying
to fine-tune the telescope and test its instruments, and have
repeatedly reported problems.
   Engineers first discovered that a cable not installed properly
was blocking the rotation of an antenna. This was corrected by
limiting the antenna movement.
   Later, they found that incorrect computer software was causing
the telescope to point at the wrong places in the sky. The software
was changed.
   The experts also discovered that the 25,500-pound satellite
developed a vibration that lasted for some minutes each time it
went from sunrise to sunset and back again in its orbit. Engineers
planned to compensate for the vibration with another computer
program.
   But there is no way to fix the focusing flaw from the ground,
said Weiler. Instead, he said NASA plans to try to move up a
scheduled space shuttle maintenance flight to the telescope.
   Weiler said a replacement wide-field camera that had already
been scheduled for the Hubble may be built with special optics that
would correct the focusing distortion caused by the telescope
mirrors.
   ``We are pretty optimistic that we can take out all of the
aberration,'' said Weiler.
   Hubble maintenance flights by the space shuttle were originally
planned for 1993, 1996 and 1997, and Weiler said those may be flown
earlier if replacement instruments that correct the focusing flaw
can be prepared.
   ``We are not losing science,'' he said. ``We are deferring
science.''
   Olivier, who has been a leader in checking out the telescope,
said that engineers saw a pattern in their tests that had ``the
classical characteristic you would expect for a spherical
aberration,'' where light does not focus at a point as intended,
but over a small volume.
   The two mirrors were tested individually on the ground, said
Olivier, and passed all tests. He said they were not tested in
combination on the ground because this would have required a test
arrangement that would have cost ``hundreds of millions of
dollars.''
   Before launch, the agency said the five instruments aboard would
detect objects 25 times fainter than the dimmest seen from Earth,
and would expand the size of the observable universe by 250 times.
   Objects in the farthest reaches of the universe, some 14 billion
light years or 82 billion trillion miles away, were expected to be
visible. Since the universe is thought to be 15 to 20 billion years
old, the telescope would be seeing objects only a short time after
the so-called big bang that astronomers believe is the origin of
the universe.

<HEAD>No Gold Medals Awarded in Ballet Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges for the third New York International
Ballet Competition were unable to award gold medals when the event
concluded Monday night.
   It is the third time the competition has failed to produce
superior winners. No gold was awarded for men in 1984, and none for
women in 1987.
   ``The basic principle of the competition is that the candidate
for the gold should exhibit a very well-rounded dance education,''
said Igor Youskevitch, artistic director of the competition. ``When
such a candidate stands out, there are no doubts on the part of the
panel. If there is no such clear cut candidate, then they can elect
not to award the gold.''
   There were, however, excellent demonstrations by dancers during
the five-day event.
   At a special awards gala tonight, silver medals will be given to
Aidar Akhemetov of the Soviet Union and Victor Alvarez of Spain in
the men's category, and Dilana Nikiforova of Bulgaria in the
women's category.
   Bronze medals will go to Ventizislav Petroff of Bulgaria and
Slawomir Wozniak of Poland in the men's category, and Kathleen
Arcieri, of Westfield, N.J., Valerie Robin of Milwaukee and Sylvina
Perillo of Argentina in the women's category.
   Barry Hughson of Washington received a special award for
partnering, and Anthony Huen of the Netherlands was awarded a prize
for artistic achievement.
   Thirty dancers from 16 countries, ages 17-22, competed during
rounds at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. It was the first time
the Soviet Union was represented.
   Past winners have been recruited by major ballet companies from
around the world. For those who were already in troupes, winning
has led principal dancer spots.

<HEAD>Striking Unions Call For Ban On Replacement Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the unions striking Eastern
Airlines and Greyhound Lines on Tuesday urged organized labor to
push Congress to ban hiring of permanent replacement workers.
   ``Workers in the USA have in theory the right to strike, but
they don't have the right to win a strike,'' George Kourpias,
international president of the Machinists union, told the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees convention.
   Both Eastern, struck by the Machinists on March 4, 1989, and
Greyhound, struck by its drivers March 2, have continued to operate
with replacement workers.
   Companion bills by U.S. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., and Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, would prevent companies from giving
permanent status to workers hired during a strike. The bills are
pending in committees.
   Eastern's pledge to protect its replacement workers has become a
major sticking issue between its unions and trustee Martin Shugrue,
appointed in April to run the airline after creditors lost faith in
the management led by Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   ``What I'm really afraid of is that the trustee appointed is
talking out of both sides of his mouth,'' Kourpias said.
   Kourpias said that while Shugrue made obtaining labor peace a
priority, ``he protects scabs who have taken our jobs.'' The
airline needs the experience and dedication of the strikers for
long-term survival, Kourpias said.
   Kourpias said more negotiations are expected this week between
Eastern and its Machinists, led by district president Charles E.
Bryan.
   ``We're ready to go back to work with a new labor agreement,''
Kourpias said.
   A planned meeting between Shugrue and Eastern creditors was
postponed Tuesday.
   The Eastern pilots and flight attendants unions ended sympathy
walkouts last November, but they have expressed frustration that
Eastern has hired back only handfuls of union workers while keeping
replacement workers.
   James LaSala, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union
representing Greyhound drivers, said his union, like Eastern's
Machinists, felt they were forced to strike because of
``union-busting tactics.''
   ``No matter what happens in this strike, our union will still be
here,'' LaSala said.
   But hiring replacement workers who can keep their jobs after
strikes gives companies an unfair boost in overcoming strikes, he
said.
   Organized labor should hold accountable politicians who allow
management to have such unfair advantages, LaSala said. ``Now it's
time for them to show us their support.''
   Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of
America, gave a stirring call for solidarity and political pressure
in the 1990s, following his union's strike at West Virginia last
year, which he said was successful because of ``the belief that
working people in this country had finally had enough.''
   The labor meeting will host South African anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela on Thursday.

   Scientists were dismayed Wednesday after
learning that a problem with the Hubble Space Telescope's mirrors
will render its cameras almost useless until a space shuttle can be
sent on a repair mission.
   ``It's a major blow to our hopes,'' said Kim Leschly of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena. ``It is very disappointing, extremely
disappointing.''
   David Koo, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, learned of the telescope's woes when a reporter called
seeking his reaction.
   ``Gee, your mom died. How do you feel?'' he replied.
   Koo had planned to analyze the Hubble's photographs of random
patches of the universe to look for unexpected discoveries.
   ``Many people were hoping to see new views of the universe. Now
we'll have to wait,'' he said. ``That's very, very disappointing.''
   NASA had planned to make repairs in June 1993 and said it may
move up that mission.
   ``People aren't crying,'' said John Holtzman, an astronomer at
Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz. ``It's just that there have
been so many delays in this project that when you say wait another
three years, it's slightly depressing.''
   Holtzman was interviewed by phone from a telescope science team
office near Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
   NASA officials announced Wednesday that a manufacturing error
prevents proper focusing of the $1.5 billion telescope's mirrors.
   They said that until space shuttle astronauts can make repairs,
the problem will make the telescope's most important instrument _
the Wide-Field and Planetary Camera _ virtually useless.
   The flaw also will make the telescope's second camera, which is
designed to detect faint distant objects, unable to take pictures
any better than those taken by a ground-based telescope. Three
other instruments, which detect various types of light but aren't
cameras, will be less seriously impaired.
   The reaction at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which built the
wide-field camera, was ``how come people making the mirror didn't
do their job right?'' said Leschly, the camera's systems engineer.
``As part of the Hubble team, you feel disappointed somebody didn't
do it right, and that hurts.''
   The mirrors and their supports were manufactured by Perkin-Elmer
Corp., now Hughes Danbury Optical Corp., of Danbury, Conn.
   Company official Jack Rehnberg said human error may have been to
blame.
   NASA officials in Washington said they may correct the problem
by modifying a second-generation wide-field camera now under
construction at the Pasadena laboratory. The new camera could be
equipped with special optics to compensate for the focusing flaw
caused by the faulty mirrors, Leschly said.
   Astronauts had been scheduled to replace the existing wide-field
camera with the new camera in June 1993, but NASA indicated it
would try to fly the repair mission earlier.
   ``There is a path out of this, and there still will be images
from the current camera that will be reasonably exciting, but they
won't push the frontier,'' Leschly said, adding that the camera
``works flawlessly'' but is crippled by the mirror problem.
   ``We're down for a while, but on our way up,'' he said. ``You
can still see hope at the end of the tunnel.''

<HEAD>Anonymous Caller Threatens to Kill Kidnapped American</HEAD>

   An anonymous caller saying he spoke on
behalf of Colombian guerrillas who allegedly kidnapped Scott
Heimdal told a television station Wednesday that the American would
be killed if ransom demands weren't met.
   The caller, a male who spoke with a Colombian accent, said the
group holding Heimdal, a gold miner, was the same one that
kidnapped Spanish businessman Pablo Martin Berrocal last August,
the station said.
   Berrocal was freed in April after his family paid a $1 million
ransom.
   Heimdal's kidnappers earlier identified themselves as members of
the People's Liberation Army. But the anonymous caller said the
National Liberation Army was holding Heimdal.
   Diplomatic sources said it was doubtful the National Liberation
Army kidnapped Heimdal because it operates in northern Colombia,
far from the Ecuadoran border region where Heimdal was captured.
   The caller also said IMINCO, the small mining company for which
Heimdal worked, received $1 million to be used as ransom, but the
company denied it. The caller did not say where the company
received the money from.
   Meanwhile, the government has ordered IMINCO to suspend its
operations, the mine's owner, Jeffrey Fino, said Wednesday. Fino
said, however, the company had already suspended its operations.
   Fino, also an American, said he did not know the reasons behind
the suspension, which he learned of in a letter received Tuesday
from the Ecuadoran Institute of Mines. He said work had stopped at
the mine when the 27-year-old Heimdal was kidnapped April 28.
   Fino said he has not been involved in the negotiations since
Heimdal's parents arrived June 18 in Quito from Peoria, Ill., to
take charge of efforts to win his release.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman refused to comment on either the
anonymous call or the suspension of Fino's mining operation.
   Heimdal was kidnapped as he traveled by boat near the gold
mining camp, where he was in charge of starting river dredging
operations.
   He is reportedly being held in a jungle camp on the Colombian
side of the border.
   Fino said he suspended mining operations after Heimdal's
kidnapping and was selling off his equipment. He said the mine
never reached the production stage.
   Heimdal's kidnappers have asked a ransom of $612,000 paid in
Colombian pesos. Heimdal's parents raised about $60,000, mostly in
community donations, and that money has been given to the
guerrillas to assure Heimdal's safety while negotiations continue.
   In Washington, a government source said on condition of
anonymity that a meeting is scheduled Friday between the kidnappers
and officials working for Heimdal's release.

   Lithuania's leaders rushed to Moscow on
Wednesday for their second meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in two days as they tried to come up with a compromise on
the republic's drive for independence.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene called Gorbachev on Wednesday afternoon to
arrange the meeting. It took place a few hours later at Gorbachev's
dacha in the forest outside Moscow, Lithuanian parliament
spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said.
   Lithuania's Supreme Council, or parliament, was scheduled to
begin debating the proposed compromise Thursday morning. It calls
for a three-month moratorium on the republic's March 11 declaration
of independence that would take effect when the Soviet Union opened
negotiations, said Lithuanian government spokesman Ceslovas
Jursenas.
   The proposal also says the moratorium would cease if the
Lithuanian government becomes unable to perform its duties,
Jursenas said.
   At the meeting, Gorbachev reiterated that Lithuania must freeze
its declaration of independence before he would end crippling
economic sanctions and begin negotiations, Ms. Dapkus said.
   Oil supplies, most natural gas and many raw materials and
manufactured goods have been cut off since mid-April when the
Kremlin imposed the embargo to pressure Lithuania to rescind its
independence declaration. The blockade has put nearly 50,000 people
out of work among the republic's 1.1 million workers.
   Gorbachev did not mention his earlier insistence that Lithuania
abide by the law on secession passed by the Soviet parliament
earlier this year, said Ms. Dapkus.
   Lithuanians say the secession law imposes conditions that make
it impossible for a republic to leave the Soviet Union. The law
makes secession illegal without a republic-wide referendum,
approval by the Soviet parliament and a transition period of up to
five years.
   Ms. Dapkus said Gorbachev urged the Lithuanian parliament to
take action quickly on the proposed compromise.
   Gorbachev gave no reason for the urgency, she said.
   But a critical Soviet Communist Party Congress is set to open
Monday and the expected showdown between reformers and hardliners
could affect Gorbachev's political situation.
   Lithuanian officials also are facing a critical point due to the
increasingly severe effects of the Kremlin's economic blockade.
   Lithuanian government officials said Wednesday that they do not
have enough fuel to begin the grain harvest, which should start
next week. They said they soon would have to restrict fuel
elsewhere and begin cutting back on hot water supplies to homes.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoted a Lithuanian
spokesman in Moscow, Virgilius Savitskas, as saying that during the
90-minute meeting with Gorbachev the Lithuanian officials were
``searching for a reasonable compromise'' with Gorbachev over the
republic's independence declaration.
   Tass, in its report Wednesday night, said negotiations could be
held only ``if Lithuania declares a moratorium and suspends the act
of March 11 for a period of talks.''
   It was the second meeting in as many days between Lithuanian
leaders and Gorbachev as a divided Lithuanian parliament and
society prepared for the parliamentary debate.
   The Lithuanian delegation left Moscow immediately after the
talks ended and headed back to Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, on
a special flight, said officials of the republic's mission in
Moscow.
   Accompanying Landsbergis and Mrs. Prunskiene were Deputy Prime
Minister Romualdas Ozolas, legislative leader Egidius Bickauskas
and two other lawmakers.
   Gorbachev met with Landsbergis on Tuesday morning and spoke with
Mrs. Prunskiene by telephone two hours later.
   Ms. Dapkus said Wednesday's meeting carried more weight because
it also involved Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, Soviet
parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and Gorbachev's close
adviser, Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev.
   At the meeting, Gorbachev that if Lithuania freezes its
independence declaration the republic could either negotiate
directly with the Soviet government or participate in planned
negotiations on a new union treaty that would link the 15 Soviet
republics in a looser structure, Ms. Dapkus said.
   ``Gorbachev urged Lithuania to take part in the inter-Soviet
treaty,'' Ms. Dapkus said.
   Gorbachev aides have described this new-look union as anything
from a federation, like the United States, to a confederation, like
the European Community, which allies independent countries.
   Lithuanian officials said privately a sharp debate was going on
in the republic on how their drive for independence would be
affected by the upcoming Communist Party Congress and its effect on
Gorbachev's power.
   The Lithuanians indicated they do not know if they should accept
the compromise while Gorbachev is strong enough to offer it, or
hold out for possible victory by reformers who support the
republic's right to independence.
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940,
along with the Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia. Those
republics have also declared they want to regain their
independence, but have taken a slower approach than Lithuania.

   A bill to require a seven-day waiting period
for the purchase of a handgun from a gun dealer was approved
Tuesday by a House subcommittee.
   On a 6-4 vote, the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on
crime approved the ``Brady bill'' _ named after James S. Brady,
former President Reagan's press secretary who was shot in a March
1981 assassination attempt on Reagan.
   Brady watched the proceeding from a wheelchair as the panel
defeated on a 5-5 tie vote an amendment by Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., to instead require states to toughen so-called
``point-of-purchase'' identification procedures for handgun
purchases.
   McCollum's measure, which was supported by the National Rifle
Association, would still have allowed a handgun buyer to take
immediate possession of the weapon. After five years, the amendment
would have required states to include fingerprints on drivers'
licenses as an identification system for handgun purchases.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J.,
called the amendment ``just another attempt to dismember the Brady
bill.''
   ``I agree it's inconvenient to wait, ... but we're attempting to
do something about the carnage that takes place every day,'' Hughes
said, citing the 30,000 victims of handgun violence since the House
struck the Brady measure from a dru bill in 1988.
   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate but has not
been acted on.
   But the Senate last month, in a 52-48 vote, approved curbing
nine types of rapid-fire assault weapons over the NRA's objections
as part of a crime bill. Later, though, NRA supporters led an
effort to thwart speedy action on the bill and it remains stalled.
   Brady's wife, Sarah, who with her husband now lobbies Congress
on behalf of gun-control measures, said the combination of the two
votes demonstrates that more lawmakers ``are choosing police and
public safety over the special interest gun lobby.''
   ``Congress need not be held in a stranglehold by the extremist
leaders at the National Rifle Association,'' she said.

   Contra commanders on
Wednesday surrendered their weapons to President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro in a ceremony hailing the end of a nine-year civil war
that left 30,000 people dead.
   ``Today the war ends,'' presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo
said.
   Mrs. Chamorro accepted the weapons from 100 top rebel commanders
led by Israel Galeano in San Pedro de Lovago, 100 miles east of the
capital.
   Meanwhile, shortly after the ceremony, two helicopters carying
about 24 journalists collided as they were taking off and at least
14 people were injured, according to reports. The journalists
aboard included photographers for The Associated Press and Agence
France-Presse.
   In a speech, Mrs. Chamorro promised to disarm the leftist
Sandinistas who led the government for 11 years. There have been
charges the Sandinistas distributed weapons among their supporters
before leaving office on April 25.
   ``We're going to disarm everyone peacefully, without hate and
without resentment,'' Mrs. Chamorro said, adding that she would ask
local officials nationwide to ``tell me in writing'' where
Sandinista arms caches were hidden.
   The Contras cited the alleged arming of the civilian population
when they missed several deadlines to disarm.
   Galeano, speaking during the ceremony, said: ``It is an honor to
say to the Nicaraguan people: mission accomplished. The struggle
has been to establish a government of laws in this country.''
   Troops from an international demobilization force used
blowtorches to destroy the weapons on the spot.
   ``I feel proud and happy as a Nicaraguan woman and mother
because the boys have turned over their arms so Nicaragua can live
in peace,'' Mrs. Chamorro said.
   The weapons included automatic rifles and a second batch of
surface-to-air missiles. On Tuesday, Galeano handed over 62 of the
U.S.-made Red Eye missiles to the head of the United Nations force
that has overseen the demobilization of more than 18,000 Contras,
Gen. Agustin Quesada.
   ``We hope this signifies that peace will endure in Nicaragua,''
Galeano told the Spanish general.
   The former Sandinista government led by Daniel Ortega lost a
Feb. 25 election to the conservative coaltion led by Mrs. Chamorro.
   About 30,000 people died and another 25,000 were wounded in the
war between the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua, a nation the size of Iowa with 3.6 million residents.
   Galeano insisted the Contras were never tools of U.S. policy, as
many charged, and said they arose as a peasant reaction to
Sandinista attempts to impose ``foreign, totalitarian and
expansionist ideologies'' on Nicaragua.
   He gave up the first set of missiles in El Amendro, a town 190
miles southeast of Managua in Rio San Juan Province, where the
Contras have been promised land and a degree of local autonomy.
   Galeano said the United States had given the Contras more than
100 of the missiles the last four years of the war. He claimed the
rebels downed 35 government aircraft with them.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has played a key role in
persuading the rebels to lay down their arms, celebrated a Mass
marking the war's end. He said peace depends on putting aside the
``language of hate and vengeance.''
   Diplomats from the United States, which armed the Contras early
in the Reagan administration, and from the Soviet Union, which
armed the Sandinistas they tried to overthrow, were invited to
Wednesday's ceremony, Lacayo said.
   The rebels began disarming on May 8, and U.N. officials say
about 1,000 still have their weapons.
   The elections were held under a regional peace accord that
called for the Contras to disarm.
   The war, along with the harsh U.S. economic sanctions that
contributed to bringing the Nicaraguan economy to a virtual
standstill, were thought the key factors behind the Sandinistas'
defeat.
   Washington lifted the economic embargo after Mrs. Chamorro's
victory and sent Nicaragua $300 million in needed foreign aid.

   Record temperatures spurred wildfires that burned dozens of
homes in Southern California, and another death was attributed to
the heat on Wednesday in Phoenix, which cooled off _ to 118 degrees.
   Utilities from the coast inland to Las Vegas asked the public to
reduce electricity consumption as the heat wave lingered for a
third day. Heat-related power outages were scattered throughout Los
Angeles on Tuesday, when electrical use set an all-time record;
5,000 customers lost electricity for a few hours.
   Road pavers got a double dose of heat in Texas.
   ``The asphalt is 380 degrees, plus the 100 or so degrees (from
the weather). It makes for pretty rough working conditions,'' said
Danny Jones, vice president of Jones Brothers Paving Contractors in
Odessa.
   High pressure, which combined to give Phoenix back-to-back
all-time records of 120 and 122 degrees, abated only slightly
Wednesday. The mercury topped out at another record for the date,
118 in the late afternoon. The slight drop was attributed to a
cloud cover early in the day, the National Weather Service said.
   A 57-year-old suburban Phoenix man, who was working outdoors at
his home, was found unconscious by relatives. Paramedics were
called, but the victim was dead on arrival at a hospital. His body
temperature had reached 108 degrees, police Sgt. James Flonacher
said.
   The deaths of three other people Tuesday in Phoenix also were
ruled caused by the heat. Authorities in Los Angeles said a
4-year-old boy died in a parked car with the windows rolled up
Tuesday.
   An enormous, upper-level, high-pressure system over New Mexico
created the heat wave by beating back the Pacific Ocean's normal
cooling influence.
   ``I liken it to a huge umbrella sitting over the Southwest and
it's just baking under there, but it's not quite reaching San
Francisco,'' said weather service meteorologist Art Lessard.
   On the West Coast, the heat was on before dawn. By midafternoon,
the mercury hit 109 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 7 degrees over
the 1976 mark for June 27. Tuesday's 112-degree mark topped the
all-time record of 110 degrees set Sept. 4, 1988.
   The mercury topped 100 in the valleys north and east of Los
Angeles, and in the deserts. Palm Springs was 116 by midafternoon.
Normally balmy San Diego was a record 91.
   The forecast offered no relief. The weather service said highs
would be in the 100s in the inland cities and slightly lower
elsewhere through Sunday.
   Los Angeles County lifeguards bolstered their forces to handle
the throngs seeking relief on the shore, where temperatures were
about 20 degrees lower than inland.
   ``We have extra personnel and we're holding them later because
we had over 200 rescues at Santa Monica beach between 8 and 9 last
night,'' said lifeguard Randy Degregori. Electricity use also set a
record Tuesday in Los Angeles.
   The dry heat hampered firefighters.
   A blaze that killed six firefighters and injured five others
spread over 15,000 acres of Arizona's most verdant pine forest
Wednesday and forced the evacuation of subdivisions totaling nearly
800 residences.
   In Southern California counties, a total of 45 homes were
destroyed or damaged in brush fires by Wednesday night.
   A 125-acre fire near Hemet, in Riverside County, injured 17
firefighters, some of them so badly they were airlifted to the burn
center at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, said fire information
spokeswoman Deborah Bennett.
   Although the most intense heat ever experienced in a major U.S.
city lessened, Wednesday was still a bad day for motorists in
Phoenix, Arizona Automobile Association operations specialist Trish
Zigante said.
   ``We are getting a lot of tows, which is probably heating, and
also a lot of flat tires,'' Ms. Zigante said. ``Then of course
there are the battery jumps.''
   Ms. Zigante said the AAA in Phoenix averaged 700 trouble calls
per weekday before Monday but had answered 1,100 to 1,200 each of
the first two days of the week and seemed to be running near that
Wednesday.
   And while neither rain, nor sleet nor snow nor dark of the night
might keep letter carriers from swift completion of their appointed
rounds, the heat in Texas is.
   The Postal Service told customers they might expect minor delays
in daily delivery because carriers would be taking more breaks to
drink water and cool off. Lubbock is sweltering through the hottest
June on record, with 18 days of temperatures over 100.
   ``We are concerned for their health,'' said Don Jones, postal
field operations director. ``This is bad weather for them.''

   Nelson Mandela leaves the capital today
assured of some political support and buoyed by a tumultuous rally
where he was serenaded, praised and nearly worshipped by more than
19,000 Washingtonians.
   ``We thank you, America. We thank you for being true to your
responsibility ... We thank you for responding to our cause,'' the
black South African leader told the cheering crowd Tuesday night.
   Mandela was leaving today for Atlanta after a three-day
Washington visit during which he won assurances from President Bush
and members of Congress of continuing U.S. economic sanctions
against South Africa's white government.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader also called
Tuesday for financial assistance to his country once the apartheid
system of racial segregation is abolished.

   Environmentalists praised President
Bush's moratorium on offshore drilling but said it doesn't go far
enough. An industry group called it a mistake, and Democrats
accused the White House of playing politics.
   ``If the president really wants to protect the California coast,
he should make it permanent, not make it look as though he's just
delaying oil drilling off our coast until after the 1990 governor's
race and his own re-election campaign in 1992,'' Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy, a Democrat, said Tuesday.
   Bush suspended until at least the year 2000 new leases for
drilling off much of California, Oregon, Washington, southern
Florida and New England.
   He ordered further environmental studies to determine if
drilling leases might be offered after that.

   Environmentalists charge that the Bush
administration's plans to balance the interests of Northwest
loggers against survival of the northern spotted owl are an assault
on the Endangered Species Act.
   The administration Tuesday announced preliminary plans for
saving the owl by restricting logging. The plan would cost 1,000
Northwest logging jobs.
   At the same time, the administration asked for relaxation of the
1973 Endangered Species Act to let policy-makers weigh the economic
and social costs against the benefits of saving animals that are
listed as threatened.
   ``They list the owl but now they're going to change the law so
they don't have to protect it,'' Larry Tuttle, Oregon director of
The Wilderness Society, said Tuesday.

   Bankers rescued Donald Trump with a $65 million
bailout, but the master of the Art of the Deal paid a humbling
price, giving up some control over his empire and putting himself
on a $450,000 monthly allowance.
   The deal reached Tuesday is designed to help the once seemingly
invincible Trump out of a cash crunch that could have brought down
his empire.
   A clearly relieved Trump said in an interview Tuesday that he's
happy with the outcome and confirmed that the agreement limits his
household and personal spending to $450,000 a month for the rest of
this year.
   ``There are certain restrictions,'' he said. ``I can live with

   Senators who defeated a constitutional
amendment against burning the American flag say the uproar may have
eased slightly in recent weeks but the issue remains a sore point
with many voters.
   ``It's still a tough issue,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said
Tuesday after the Senate's 58-42 vote for the measure fell nine
votes short of the two-thirds margin required.
   He said the dispute has ``opened a wound in this nation,'' but
voters are seeing ``that the fabric of American society has not
been threatened by flag burners ... and in the end I think that's
what turned this debate.''
   On the roll call, 38 Republicans voted for the amendment and
seven opposed it. Among Democrats, 20 were for it and 35 against.

   The Louisiana Senate ignored a
threatened gubernatorial veto in passing what would be the nation's
strictest state abortion law _ a measure outlawing abortion even in
cases of rape or incest.
   ``There's no indication at all that he's changed his mind about
a veto,'' Gov. Buddy Roemer's spokesman, Rusty Jabour, said
Tuesday. Roemer has said he would veto any bill that does not
include exceptions for rape and incest.
   The bill would send doctors who perform abortions to prison for
up to 10 years of hard labor. Women who obtain abortions would not
be prosecuted.
   The House passed a version of the bill last week and was to get
the measure again, possibly as early as today, to vote on
amendments the Senate added to clarify that abortion would be
allowed to save the life of the mother.

   A large area in the wooded
mountains of northern Yugoslavia was a ``forbidden zone'' for 40
years. With the erosion of communist power, the people finally are
learning why.
   An underground warren was built in the mountains to protect the
Communist Party elite of the Slovenian republic from any disaster,
ranging from nuclear war to insurrection.
   Thousands of political prisoners are said to have built the
shelter in the heart of a heavily guarded 56-square-mile area 40
miles south of Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia.
   On a tour organized by Slovenia's new non-communist government,
journalists were taken through police roadblocks to a mountain that
has been transformed into a well-concealed maze of tunnels,
galleries and shafts.
   Igor Bavcar, the Slovenian interior minister, said the
government in Ljubljana has been told similar shelters were built
by the other five republics. He expressed confidence that, as
democracy spreads, ``the veil of secrecy will be lifted from all of
them.''
   The 3,000-square-yard facility in Slovenia ``could accommodate
at least 100 people, and if the need arose, probably several
hundred more,'' said Marko Kadunc, an engineer employed there since
1961. He said stocks of fuel, food and water were sufficient for
several months.
   Slovenia and Croatia, the westernmost of Yugoslavia's republics,
are ruled by center-right parties that defeated reform Communists
in the first multiparty elections since World War II.
   All the other republics except the largest, Serbia, have
scheduled multiparty elections and free federal elections are
expected in the fall.
   Soon after taking office, Slovenia's new government formed a
commission to investigate the guarded zone and determine whether
political prisoners helped build it.
   Well-lighted corridors wind through the mountain past dozens of
bedrooms, a kitchen and conference rooms. There are a small
infirmary and a fully equipped operating room.
   Small, oval steel doors like submarine hatches subdivide the
underground area, and entry is through a decontamination room.
``This place was designed to survive a nuclear war,'' said Kadunc,
the engineer.
   The complex was finished in the mid-1960s, used for occasional
training exercises and gradually mothballed after 1978. More than
400 employees remained, to maintain the shelter and run a large
cattle farm and logging operation inside the restricted zone.
   An intelligence report published June 20 by the daily Borba in
Belgrade said German prisoners of war started the work on the
shelter, and Yugoslav prisoners took over after the POWs were freed
in the early 1950s.
   Political prisoners and captured officers of various armed
groups that fought the communists in World War II blasted the
tunnels in the mountain, the report said.
   The zone is just a few miles from Kocevski Rog, a mountain where
up to 15,000 anti-communist fighters who surrendered were executed
when the war ended in 1945.
   Anyone who worked on the shelter got a 20-year prison sentence
and was ``earmarked for gradual liquidation in order to safeguard
the secrecy of the forbidden zone,'' said the intelligence report,
which was confidential until Borba published it.
   Kadunc said no political prisoners had worked at the site since
he started there in 1961, and he had not heard of any being used
before that.
   ``Only free Slovenian workers with a good moral profile worked
here,'' he said.
   Slovenian government officials said the zone would not be opened
to the public before the end of 1990, to allow time for removal of
stored ammunition and other explosives.

   GALANG, Indonesia (ap) _ More than 16,000 refugees from
Indochina have been crowded onto this 63-square-mile island,
turning it into a noxious, fetid marsh, and 100 new ones arrive
every day.
   The island, in the Riau chain near Singapore, was opened as a
refugee camp in 1979 to house no more than 6,000-8,000 people with
firm commitments to be resettled in third countries.
   Lt. Col. Doekseno told 24 journalists, during the first official
tour of Galang since 1984, that the number of refugees on the
island had risen from fewer than 2,000 in March 1989 to 16,800.
   Cramped, squalid conditions have created serious threats of
disease and death, said Doekseno, one of the senior officials who
run the island jointly with the office of U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees.
   Garbage and dirty water from patched bathrooms and kitchens have
turned the camp areas, where refugees live in barracks and
makeshift tents, into stinking swamps.
   A water shortage and the steadily increasing camp population
have forced authorities on Galang to cut the water ration from 20
liters a day per person to seven. The weekly food allowance per
refugee is 2.5 kilograms of rice, about 5{ pounfs, and two cans of
sardines.
   Indonesia's problem is compounded by a new flow of ``boat
people'' from Cambodia, who began arriving in February and now
total more than 1,500.
   At least seven boatloads of Cambodians bound for Australia have
landed in Indonesia since May, Doekseno said. Some were sent to
Galang and others continued on their way after being given food and
fuel, he said.
   Indonesia does not recognize the Cambodians as refugees and
treats them differently at the Galang camps. Doekseno said they
were classified as ``displaced persons'' in order to qualify them
for some help from the U.N. refugee agency.
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas described them as ``economic
migrants'' who should be repatriated.
   Indonesian officials said the Cambodians left home with
Australia as their clear destination, carrying money and traveling
in good boats. Doekseno denied claims by Australia that Indonesia
refuses to let Cambodians land, and said: ``We accept them ... on
humanitarian grounds.''
   Cambodians on Galang have built their own village on a hill.
They tried to make homes similar to those they left behind, using
palm fronds, mud and whatever other building materials the island
offered.
   Long Rithida, 23, a said she left her mother behind in Cambodia
and was trying to reach relatives in Australia or Canada.
   ``I don't want to go back to Cambodia,'' she said. ``My uncle is
in Canada and my aunt is in Australia. I want to live in a free
country.''
   She arrived Feb. 22 in a boat with 81 other Cambodians.
   Australia, concerned about the increasing flow of boat people,
wants Indonesia to continue its role as a country of first asylum,
where refugees are screened and sent to their countries of final
settlement: the United States, Australia and European nations.
   Indonesia says it will do so, but Foreign Minister Alatas, has
criticised what he calls the slow, selective processing of refugees
for resettlement.
   In April, Australia provided $1.5 million ($1.16 milion U.S.) to
help the U.N. refugee agency improve the Galang facilities,
including sanitation and a survey to locate more water.

<HEAD>Leader Of All Eastern Orthodoxy Making First U.S. Visit</HEAD>

   The Christian shepherd of the East, Ecumenical
Patriarch Dimitrios I, next week begins a monthlong and
unprecedented visit in the West with U.S. church flocks.
   ``A journey of love and unity,'' he has called it.
   It's the first trip to this continent in history by a presiding
spiritual leader of the 250 million Eastern Orthodox believers
around the world, about 7 million of them in the United States.
   He's to take part in Washington in a Lay-Clergy Congress of the
Greek Orthodox Church led by Archbishop Iakovos, meet with
President Bush, and visit 10 other cities, conferring with church
leaders.
   He seeks to further ``ecumenical rapprochement'' and ``to
contribute to the cause of justice, friendship and peace in the
world,'' Iakovos said in an interview. Iakovos is deputy for the
patriarch in the Western Hemisphere.
   Although Eastern Orthodoxy may seem unfamiliar to some
Westerners, it wielded a powerful influence in the formative years
of Christianity, and remains its principal flock in Eastern Europe.
   It also has become a robust force in the Americas, and, spurred
by Iakovos, a vigorous participant in the ecumenical movement for
Christian unity, has added a special dimension to it.
   The Ecumenical Patriarch, bishop of ancient Constantinople (now
Istanbul, Turkey) holds a post in Eastern Orthodoxy somewhat
similar to that of the pope, the bishop of Rome, in Roman
Catholicism.
   However, while the pope has direct, juridical authority
throughout that church, the patriarch relies on intangible,
spiritual sway over mostly self-governing Orthodox churches of
various national origins.
   He is considered ``primus inter pares _ first among equals'' of
Eastern Orthodox patriarchs and bishops, the 269th successor in an
office traced back to the apostle Andrew. The papacy traces its
orgins to the apostle Peter.
   Eastern Orthodox churches, whether of Greek, Russian, Bulgarian,
Romanian or other cultural backgrounds, have similar liturgies and
hold the same doctrines, based on undivided Christianity's first
seven ecumenical councils.
   A central affirmation of faith is the Nicene Creed of 381 A.D.,
also commonly used in Western churches of Protestantism and Roman
Catholicism.
   Despite basic unity, however, Orthodoxy remains divided in this
country into a dozen branches stemming from various national
backgrounds, yet all looking to Dimitrios as pre-eminent spiritual
guide.
   Metropolitan Theodosius, head of the Russian-derived Orthodox
Church in America, expressed hope the patriarch's visit will bring
U.S. Orthodox groups into greater ``unity and harmony.''
   ``He personifies unity of all Orthodox throughout the world,''
Theodosius said in a telephone interview. ``We are hoping he will
bring us closer to the full integration that we are looking for in
our common efforts.''
   The million-member OCA is the second largest Orthodox body in
this country, next to Greek Orthodoxy which numbers two million.
   Dimitrios, a quiet, unassuming man of 75, was born Sept. 8,
1914, in Constantinople, the ``new Rome'' of the ancient Byzantine
empire, which under Turkish rule was renamed Istanbul in 1930.
   He served churches in Greece, Turkey and Iran and in 1972 was
elected ecumenical patriarch, succeeding Athenagorus I, an
eloquent, American-seasoned prelate.
   The more reserved Dimitrios initially stuck close to the
Patriarchate, the sometimes harassed and restricted headquarters in
heavily Moslem Turkey, but lately has ventured among his flock
around the world.
   In 1987, he visited the Soviet Union, conferring with prelates
there, including the late Russian Orthodox Patriarch Pimen,
succeeded in early June by Patriarch Alexi II. The visit was the
first since 1589.
   Dimitrios also visited Orthodox leaders in Greece, Yugoslavia,
Romania and Poland and Bulgaria, and Pope John Paul II at the
Vatican, the World Council of Churches in Geneva and Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie in London.
   Until the mid-20th century, Eastern Orthodoxy had been isolated
from Western Christianity for more than nine centuries since a 1054
split between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism.
   At that time, Constantinople's Patriarch and Rome's pope
excommunicated each other.
   But that prolonged, rigid, East-West rift was healed when the
late Patriarch Athenagorus and Pope Paul VI met and embraced in
Jerusalem in 1964. Afterward, the mutual excommunications were
lifted.
   Eastern Orthodoxy earlier in 1961 had joined the World Council
of Churches, previously made up mostly of Western Protestant
denominations.
   Dimitrios, whose office retains administrative ties with some
Orthodox bodies, such as the large Greek Orthodox Church of the
Americas, has no such formal oversight of indepedent or
autocephalous branches.
   But he plans meetings with their leaders, including those of the
second largest U.S. Orthodox body, the OCA, whose roots go back to
the late 1700s in Alaska (before Russia sold Alaska to the United
States in 1867).
   Most U.S. Orthodox churches arose through immigration of the
late 19th and 20th centuries.
   Arriving in Washington July 2, Dimitrios spends 10 days there
before visits in New York City, Hempstead, N. Y., Allentown and
Johnstown, Pa., San Francisco, Chicago, Buffalo and Niagara Falls,
N.Y., and Boston.

<HEAD>Leaders Not Big Fans of Economics</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Given the opportunity, even presidents and
prime ministers sometimes cut economics. They'd rather spend their
time talking about international politics, strategy and military
matters, says an economist who has watched them do it at economic
summit meetings.
   So W. Allen Wallis, a former undersecretary of state for
economic affairs, says the seven leaders at the economic summit in
Houston next month will stick to designated subjects at the formal
meetings and switch to their own agendas in more relaxed, private
settings.
   After all, they're the bosses _ four prime ministers, two
presidents and one chancellor. No professorial economists are going
to make them deal with a steady diet of the dismal science.
   Most of them aren't really very interested in economics anyhow,
Wallis said.
   At Houston, July 9 to 11, they'll probably spend their private
sessions discussing, and trying to translate, the Soviet Communist
Party conference that convenes 10 days before they do, in sessions
that could be crucial to the future of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
programs.
   They'll also be talking about progress toward reunification in
Germany, and about the risk of deunification in Canada, where the
French-Canadians of Quebec are threatening succession.
   The Houston conference will be the 16th economic summit meeting,
and like those that went before, it is not likely to produce drama
or major decisions. Off past performance, chances are it will be
dull, especially when sticking to business.
   Summit staff veterans agree that the annual meetings are useful,
for the contacts, conversation and agenda-setting. But they seldom
decide anything, and the final communiques usually are worded to
paper over the most nettlesome issues.
   The summits began in 1975 when the leaders of France and West
Germany, who had conferred while serving as finance ministers,
invited the heads of other Western industrial democracies and Japan
to join for an economic conference at the top.
   Those meetings were supposed to be informal, but that doesn't
work with heads of governments. They have their own protocol and
their own lingo. Each of the seven delegations _ eight counting the
European Economic Community _ is entitled to 15 members, all
expenses paid by the host country.
   Each government head has a personal representative for the
summit, a role Wallis filled six times for President Reagan. In
economic summit-speak, the representatives are called sherpas
because, like Himalayan mountain guides, they plan and preview the
route to the summit. Those top summit aides hold four formal
mini-summits of their own in advance of the main event.
   At a briefing at the American Enterprise Institute for Public
Policy Research, a panel of economists who have been involved in
prior summits looked toward the one just ahead.
   They agreed that trade barriers, especially on agricultural
products, need discussion at the summit, and that the altered state
of East-West relations also should be a prime summit topic.
   By the time they get to Houston, the Western heads of state may
be showing traces of summit fatigue _ they meet a week earlier at
London for a NATO summit.
   The quest for a new international trade agreement by the end of
the year is a priority for the Bush administration. As the summit
host, President Bush is first among equals in influence at such
sessions, and his agenda would customarily be followed.
   But Robert J. Morris, another former summit planner, said French
President Francois Mitterrand may have a different idea.
   Morris, now senior vice president of the U.S. Council for
International Business, said the French leader ``takes almost glee
in spiking the summits that are hosted by American presidents.''
   This time, he said, Mitterrand wants the summit to consider
Western aid to the Soviet Union, a notion the administration
considers premature at best.
   The Houston meetings aren't likely to change minds on that, or
produce deals on much else.
   ``Economic summits are not, and should not be, occasions for
explicit agreements or formal actions,'' Wallis said in an
appraisal to be published by the institute. ``They should be
occasions for heads of government to converse candidly with their
peers. At home, remember, they have no peers.''

   There was a time when the Atlanta zoo was
regarded as a kind of animal concentration camp, a place where one
keeper ate rabbits from the petting zoo and where other beasts
lived and died unnaturally.
   But that was before zoo director Terry Maple came along with his
imagination and enthusiasm and organizational skills. Six years
later and halfway through a $50 million renovation, the Atlanta zoo
is a respected model in the zoological world, and Terry Maple is a
very tired man.
   ``This zoo has been enormously difficult to build. It has taxed
me in every imaginable way. It has taken every ounce of energy I've
had,'' says Maple, 43.
   Willie B. probably does not appreciate the effort, though he has
benefited. The popular lowland gorilla, named after former Atlanta
Mayor William B. Hartsfield, lived alone in a cage for 27 years;
now he lives outside, in a lush, jungle-like habitat.
   There are new displays of flamingos and rhinos; a Masai Mara
exhibit for giraffes, lions and elephants; a replica of the
Indonesian rain forest for orangutans; a Sheba Sumatran tiger
forest, where tigers will be bred under the auspices of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.
   ``We opened those exhibits fast and furious. We recovered faster
than any zoo ever recovered. And the pace was painful,'' Maple said.
   But the growth spurt was not as painful as the zoo's situation
when Maple came aboard. Parade magazine had rated the zoo as among
the nation's 10 worst; only $10,000 was budgeted each year for zoo
maintenance.
   A 15-year-old zoo elephant named Twinkles died while on loan to
a traveling circus in North Carolina. In addition to the rabbits
that fell victim to the keeper's appetite, at least eight other zoo
animals perished, including a baboon whose decapitated body was
found in a dump truck.
   The name was changed to Zoo Atlanta, but Maple and his staff
envisioned more than semantic changes _ they wanted to build a firm
foundation of support.
   Membership in Friends of Zoo Atlanta has swelled from 5,000 to
just over 53,000, making it fifth largest among non-profit zoo
support groups in the country, said Cheryl Moody, director of
membership.
   Attendance has increased from about 260,000 in 1984 to a
projected 983,870 this year, though adult ticket prices have
climbed from $2.50 to $6.75.
   The annual budget, less than $1 million in 1984, is $7.7 million
this year; the staff has nearly tripled, from 40 to 115.
   The zoo, which ended 1989 with a $48,000 deficit, is on the
verge of operating in the black, said business manager Dennis
Baker. This year's goal is to create a $500,000 surplus to help the
zoo through the lean winter months.
   All this requires the kind of showmanship that has become a fact
of life for modern zoos. Recent promotions for Zoo Atlanta included
Father's Day at the Zoo, the chance to adopt a lovebird on
Valentine's Day, and a ``summer beach party'' in February billed as
the Zoo Atlanta Beach Bash.
   The zoo's progress has not gone unnoticed. It has regained its
membership in the AAZPA, and has been widely applauded by zoo
professionals.
   ``Terry Maple is a natural leader, and he has an incredible
commitment to wildlife and wild places,'' said Robert Wagner,
executive director of the AAZPA. ``He has brought those things as
well as his incredible enthusiasm to Zoo Atlanta, and all have just
fallen into place behind him.''
   Llewellyn Haden, chairman of the zoo's governing board, said,
``He in many ways is the zoo.''
   But Maple, a psychology professor at the Georgia Institute of
Technology who had served as deputy director and curator of the
Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, says his tenure is something of an
accident.
   He had intended to stay three months, he said, but ``I got
sidetracked into building a local zoo.'' Now he is considering a
return to academic life, where he would have time for his family
and time to write a book on his experiences.
   ``I am not writing my resignation,'' he said. ``I am totally
committed to this place. The question is can the old zoo director
squeak out a book somehow and still be zoo director? There are not
enough hours in the day.''
   But in the same breath, Maple also talks of the challenges that
lie ahead for the zoo. There are financial challenges and
promotional challenges. And then there are the bear exhibits _ an
embarrassment, he said.
   ``It's strictly an animal welfare issue,'' Maple said. ``They're
one of the last vestiges of the old zoo. It's hard to accept that
they exist.''

<TEXT>
   The late Fred Allen once described a radio
network executive as a man in charge of turning molehills into
mountains.
   In television, they do it in reverse.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' is coming to television this fall as a
Saturday morning cartoon. ``Look Who's Talking'' will debut on the
small screen as ``Baby Talk,'' with Tony Danza providing the baby's
grown-up voice.
   Television apparently has no qualms about ripping off the film
industry. Heck, TV will even make an entire series from a song.
Remember ``Harper Valley PTA?'' Not the one on the radio sung by
Jeannie C. Riley. The one on NBC starring Barbara Eden.
   This cloning of sorts has been going on for at least a decade.
But this season the trend has reached new proportions as network
executives raid the big screen with a vengeance.
   There are nearly a dozen shows on the Big Three fall schedules
that come directly from film. This might lead a normal person to
assume these hybrids fare well with television audiences.
   They don't.
   Most of them fail, some of them embarrassingly. ``Tales of the
Gold Monkey,'' an unabashed rip-off of Indiana Jones, lasted one
season on ABC in 1982.
   That was nothing, however, compared to the rush by all three
networks to imitate the raunchy success of ``Animal House'' in 1979.
   CBS' ``Co-Ed Fever'' lasted one episode. NBC's ``Brothers and
Sisters'' ran for 2{ months. ``Delta House'' on ABC made it for
three months before getting the hook.
   The undisputed success story in this ever-growing genre of
television is ``M-A-S-H,'' whose finale was the most-watched
telecast in TV history. ``The Odd Couple'' was successful on ABC
and ran for five seasons, but nothing has ever come close to
duplicating the 11-year success of ``M-A-S-H.''
   If movies don't translate well into TV, why do network
executives continue to do it?
   Well, they say, television is a crap shoot, period. Might as
well try something already familiar to viewing audiences.
   Take CBS, for example. ``Bagdad Cafe,'' a spring series, has
been renewed for fall. ``Uncle Buck,'' taken from John Candy's
slapstick, gross comedy film, is a new fall show. ``Big'' is in the
spring line up. ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' will become
a Saturday morning kid show come September.
   ``Although the failure rate is very high,'' said Peter
Tortorici, senior vice president for CBS planning and scheduling,
``in the game that we play in network television, the failure rate
for everything is very high. Eighty to 90 percent of everything you
try doesn't work.''
   Other past CBS efforts have included ``House Calls'' (1979 to
1982), ``Private Benjamin'' (1981 to 1983), ``Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers'' (one season) and ``Bad News Bears'' (two seasons).
   At NBC this year, ``Working Girl'' was fired, although it will
play through the summer. Last year's ``Baby Boom,'' starring Kate
Jackson in Diane Keaton's film role, likewise didn't pass probation
and was canceled. In 1981, ``Walking Tall,'' starring Bo Svenson as
Sheriff Buford Pusser, lasted six months.
   ``They don't succeed for the same reasons that other shows
don't,'' said NBC senior vice president of series, Perry Simon.
``Either the writing isn't good or the chemistry between the
characters isn't enough.''
   ``The trick to this,'' Simon said, ``is to be able to
distinguish between a feature film and how it will translate into a
television series.''
   Meaning the movie must provide enough fodder for a weekly show.
And the actors, who often must fill the shoes of box-office stars,
must be able to make the role their own.
   Currently, NBC has just about the only successful
film-turned-television series. ``In the Heat of the Night,''
starring Carroll O'Connor and Howard Rollins in the roles created
by Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, has become a sure bet for the
peacock network.
   ABC has not been fond of turning films into TV shows, said Stu
Bloomberg, executive vice president for primetime.
   ``I've actually shied away from them,'' Bloomberg said. ``This
is the first year that we're doing them.''
   Well, not really. ABC did ``Delta House,'' remember? And
``Breaking Away'' in 1980 and ``9 to 5'' in 1982, all of them
ratings losers.
   ABC has ``Baby Talk'' in the fall. On the spring schedule for
next year is ``True Believer,'' starring Treat Williams in the role
played on the big screen by James Woods.
   ``The feature (film) makes such an impression, it's hard to get
people to star'' in a television version, Bloomberg said. ``No one
wants to be the television Tom Hanks.''
   Hank's role in ``Big,'' by the way, has yet to be cast by CBS.

<HEAD>Natives to Take on Anti-Fur Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Native people of the north are
preparing to take on the anti-fur movement _ not on the tundra, but
in the marketplace.
   Two native groups in Alaska and Canada plan to seek out small
markets to sell native-trapped and-sewn fur clothing. But animal
rights activists contend the embryonic plans are doomed, and
promise to oppose the products as much as they do furs from
non-native trappers and marketers.
   ``We have no problems with native subsistence wildlife killing
as long as its done as humanely as possible,'' said Michael
O'Sullivan, spokesman for the World Society for the Protection of
Animals in Toronto.
   ``But we cannot accept commercial fur sales. It's not who
carries out the activity, but the activity itself,'' he said.
   Alaska's Athabascan Indians and the Inuit Eskimos of Canada
retort that the animal protectionists appear to care little about
the human suffering caused by native unemployment, or about the
survival of native cultures.
   And anti-fur activists, they say, would open the door to other
forms of development that would be far more threatening to the
environment and animals.
   Their anger at the anti-fur forces has simmered for years, but
it was just three years ago that they formed Indigenous Survival
International, a militant native group that spans Alaska, Canada
and Greenland.
   The marketing strategy was the group's idea.
   If all goes according to plan, Alaska Athabascans, through their
Yukon Flats Fur Cooperative, soon will seek markets in the United
States and Europe for furs labeled ``Authentic Native Design.''
   They hope to sell through small stores, preferably owned by
natives. They envision consumers who will buy their coats, hats,
boots and other articles more for their native artistry than for
reasons of fashion.
   The plan was forged after the cooperative sold just $150,000
worth of furs in the past two years. That small return has
endangered the cooperative because banks refuse to loan it money,
said Clarence Alexander, the Athabascan chief for the village of
Fort Yukon.
   Alexander, an Indigenous Survival International member, said his
people hoped to generate the modest amounts of cash they need to
supplement a subsistence economy based mostly on hunting, trapping,
fishing and gathering.
   ``Subsistence societies like the Athabascans and the Inuit need
a little cash to buy gas for boats, to heat with oil, to buy
ammunition,'' said Robert Higgins, a spokesman for the Canadian
Inuit's umbrella organization, Inuit Tapirisat in Ottawa.
   Fur sales are their only ready source of cash, he said.
   The organization wants to revive the harvest of adult ringed
seals as a way of returning Canada's 28,000 Inuit to a subsistence
economy, Higgins said.
   Their sealing-based culture was devastated by a powerful
anti-sealing movement that caught on in 1983. The impetus was
photographs _ grisly pictures of non-native sealers clubbing Harp
seal pups to death off Newfoundland.
   Higgins said his group primarily wants to replace the Inuits'
store-bought food and clothing with seal meat and fur. But the
Inuit also will sell native-made fur clothing to raise cash, he
said.
   Anti-fur advocates accept native people's need to trap and shoot
animals for their own needs, said Pat Ragan, the program director
of wildlife for the Humane Society of the United States in
Washington, D.C.
   But ``to kill animals to market skins is another thing
altogether,'' she said. ``The only hope for these people is to get
away from marketing furs. We acknowledge that there are problems
with that, but I don't think selling furs is the way to solve
them.''
   Her group offers no alternatives to the native fur trade. ``Of
course we don't have an official position on that,'' she said.
``Our job is protecting animals.''
   Tom Morse, an Anchorage anti-fur activist, said natives wouldn't
need cash if they would return completely to the old ways. ``They
were heating their homes before the white man brought oil,'' and
snaring animals before white trappers introduced the steel leghold
trap, he said.
   ``They have the freedom to follow their own lifestyle. But when
they start combining cultures, the results have been disastrous,''
said Morse, a physics instructor at the University of Alaska in
Anchorage.
   Alexander reacted angrily to that logic.
   ``Some of us would like to return completely to the old ways,''
but the presence of non-natives and their competition for resources
makes that impossible, the Athabascan leader said.
   ``We have always been and still are a non-cash society, but we
are forced now to need some cash,'' Alexander said. Northern
natives, he said, could reject Western tools such as outboard
engines, guns and heating oil only if Morse and the non-native
populations left.
   In destroying the native fur trade, native leaders say, the
anti-fur movement is laying the groundwork for destruction of
animal habitat.
   They point to the Pribilof Islands, where the Aleuts hunted
seals for centuries. Then Congress ended the harvest in 1985,
limiting the killings to those used for food, and the federal
government withdrew subsidies for the Aleuts.
   ``Literally overnight, we had human suffering, suicides, more
than 100 documented attempted suicides, massive anxiety, and a
200-percent increase in the cost of groceries from the loss of the
subsidies,'' said Larry Merculieff, a leader of the Aleut islanders
and commissioner of the state Department of Commerce and Economic
Development.
   The state stepped in and poured millions of dollars into
development of a major port at Saint Paul Island, one of two in the
Pribilofs, for the thriving Bering Sea fishery, Merculieff noted.
   But that could have other consequences.
   ``Saint Paul soon will be opening its fishing port,'' he said.
``We will then have 2,000 transients on an island that is five
miles wide, 12 miles long, with a million seals, three million
birds and 700 Aleuts. The people being brought in are not sensitive
to village life or wildlife. The disruption won't be confined to
the environment, but to our social and cultural structure as well.''
   The state commerce chief is not optimistic about the native
marketing plan:
   ``It might work for five years or so, but in the long run, the
fur markets of the world are going to be completely destroyed by
the animal rights movement.''
   The effect on native cultures ``to me,'' Merculieff said, ``is
tantamount to genocide. But nobody seems to be listening.''

   With cold wars thawing everywhere, even
America's two long-feuding teacher unions are talking peace.
   The rival American Federation of Teachers and National Education
Association lately have been aiming not at each other, but at the
Bush administration and the nation's governors for failing to
advance much-heralded national education goals announced in
February.
   ``What's so frustrating,'' said NEA president Keith Geiger, ``is
that over the last six months, we've heard how we have to allocate
$50 billion to bail out savings and loans. But I find it
interesting that nobody said we have to allocate another $7.4
billion so we could fully fund Head Start. I thought the education
crisis was every bit as deep as the savings and loan crisis.
Obviously, it wasn't.''
   Such criticisms likely will set the tone when delegates of the
750,000-member AFT meet in Boston beginning Monday, and the 2
million-member NEA gathers in Kansas City later this week.
   In separate interviews at their Washington headquarters, AFT
president Albert Shanker and NEA chief Geiger said they intend to
challenge the president, governors and other politicians to match
their nice words about education with deeds _ and dollars.
   Each also said their unions have found more common ground than
at any time in their history.
   Both Shanker and Geiger say they have quietly developed a
personal and professional relationship unimaginable a few years
ago. They make it a point to eat lunch together at Washington's
trendy I Ricci restaurant to talk over educational and union issues.
   ``The cold war's over here, too!'' Shanker said. ``Keith Geiger
and I get along well personally. That's a relationship that hasn't
been there for a long time.''
   Shanker, 62, said he even dreams of putting the two unions on
the path to merger before he retires some day as president.
   ``The AFT and NEA are two unions that have bucked the trend of a
decline in the union movement,'' he said. ``Instead of competing
against each other, we should figure out how to pull together
people who are in educational functions in American industry. You
could have a new American labor movmenent based on information and
professional workers.''
   But neither merger nor Shanker's retirement appear imminent.
He's running for a ninth two-year term as president at his
convention and no one doubts the outcome.
   Geiger, midway through his first two-year term as head of the
nation's largest teacher union, said his keynote address will deal
with the Bush administration's failure to promote the six national
goals that grew out of last fall's historic Charlottesville, Va.,
``education summit'' with the nation's 50 governors.
   One goal dealt with early childhood education. NEA delegates
will consider a proposal calling on public schools to become
principal providers of services to preschoolers. A draft of the
proposal estimated that only 30 percent of the nation's 16.1
million children under age 5 are served by day care, nursery
schools or other programs.
   Among the more controversial initiatives facing NEA delegates
could be a report giving qualified support to alternative routes to
licensing teachers, a notion the union historically has resisted.
   Some 48 states, many facing teacher shortages, have adopted
various forms of alternative certification as a way of luring
people into teaching without requiring many hours of college
teacher training.
   Geiger himself also could be an issue at the convention, which
runs Thursday through Sunday.
   His leadership style will be on display when he addresses some
8,000 convention delegates for the first time since assuming the
presidency last summer from Mary Hatwood Futrell, arguably the most
beloved and effective NEA leader ever.
   Futrell gained national prominence for nudging an often
reluctant NEA into accepting such reform ideas as a national
professional standards board for teachers.
   Geiger isn't expected to depart much from Futrell's reform
policies. But he cited one difference with his predecessor:
   ``I have a background in both collective bargaining and
political action that's deeper than any other president the
association has ever had. I'm not afraid to talk a reform idea into
a contract. I've done it.''
   If the AFT gathering follows its usual form, nothing is likely
to happen that goes against the wishes of ``Al, the teacher's pal.''
   This year's convention will celebrate the end of the cold war in
Europe and highlight the AFT's growing role in exporting U.S.
educational practices to East Bloc nations, Shanker said.
   Jan Urban, a former Czech teacher instrumental in engineering
the election of reform president Vaclav Havel, will address the
convention.Delegations of teachers and former teachers from
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania also will
attend.
   ``I think the whole celebration of the end of the cold war is
especially important to the AFT,'' said Shanker. ``A lot of
educational organizations over the years took the view that, well,
democracy is just one form of government, and we would be
ethnocentric to tout our system as the best. We did not take that
point of view.''
   Educational choice, a pet theme of the Bush administration, also
will be a centerpiece of Shanker's opening address.
   ``Choice is a nice way to help make parents feel good about
schools,'' said Shanker. But he likely will be critical of a
recently published Brookings Institution report calling for a
radical new system allowing parents to choose freely among public
and private schools using tax dollars.
   U.S. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos will address the
approximately 3,000 AFT delegates Thursday and is expected to
defend choice and other Bush initiatives.
   AFT delegates may consider a boycott of several Japanese
carmakers who have resisted unionization, an idea that gets a
thumbs-down from Shanker.
   ``There are certain (AFL-CIO) strict standards for boycotts.
Unless they met those standards I would not support it,'' he said.
   They also will consider a resolution that would put the union on
record against commercial classroom newscasts such as Whittle
Communication's Channel One.
   Shanker was uncommittal on that issue: ``I generally oppose the
notion of putting commercials in the classroom. On the other hand,
I'm on Whittle's advisory board. It should be a good debate.''

   The official definition of a recession was established by the
National Bureau of Economic Research, a forecasting concern in
Cambridge, Mass. that has been associated with presidential
advisers Arthur Burns and Martin Feldstein and other influential
economists.
   It measures recessions through the gross national product, the
total value at retail prices of all goods and services produced by
the economy in a given time period, adjusted for inflation. The
GNP, compiled quarterly by the Commerce Department, is considered
the broadest measure of economic health.
   Generally speaking, there must be at least two consecutive
quarters of declines in GNP for the government to acknowledge a
recession has occurred. That hasn't happened since the 1981-82
recession.
   The most recent GNP figure was issued June 21, when the Commerce
Department said growth in the first quarter of this year totaled
1.9 percent on an annual basis, compared with 1.1 percent in the
final three months of 1989.

agreed to a long-term $65 million financial rescue plan.
   The banks agreed in principle Tuesday to lend another $20
million to tide Trump over while finishing touches are placed on a
restructuring to keep his sprawling real estate and casino empire

   Trump said he was happy with the deal, which will force him to

spread out payments on more than $2 billion in outstanding loans

   A dramatic increase in smoking worldwide has been
fostered by U.S. trade policies that ignore the health problems
associated with tobacco, according to a report.
   ``Globally, increasing tobacco use is responsible for almost 2.5
million excessive or premature deaths per year _ almost 5 percent
of all deaths,'' the report in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association said.
   U.S. trade policy perpetuates the problem by trying to develop

<HEAD>Developer Saved From Insolvency by $65 Million Bailout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat of bankruptcy stalking Donald Trump
has receded now that bankers have come to his rescue with a $65
million long-term loan and debt restructuring deal.
   The bailout appears to have come at a high cost to Trump, once
considered by many to be financially invincible and given great
leeway by his lenders.
   In exchange for providing the fresh credit, Trump's rescuers
have gained some control over his holdings and will closely monitor
his personal and business dealings for years to come.
   The breakthrough in prolonged negotiations over the loan and
restructuring plan came Tuesday when lawyers decided they didn't
need the approval of the lone bank that continued to balk at the
deal after some 65 to 70 decided to go along.
   Because paperwork on the complex deal was not complete, Trump's
major lenders decided to forward him a $20 million, 30-day loan so
he could make overdue payments on bonds sold to finance his Trump's
Castle hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Earlier this month, Trump missed a $43 million interest and
principal payment on the Castle bonds and got behind on a $30
million bank loan.
   After Trump missed the initial due date on the bonds June 15, a
10-day grace period went into effect. Had Trump failed to make the
payments by midnight Tuesday, he would have been in formal default
and the assets backing those debts could have been seized by
creditors.
   The negotiations yielded a new five-year commitment from Trump's
bankers that will spread out payment on more than $2 billion in
outstanding loans over the term of the pact.
   A clearly relieved Trump said in an interview that he was happy
with the outcome and confirmed that the agreement limits his
household and personal spending to $450,000 a month for the rest of
this year.
   ``There are certain restrictions ... I can live with them,'' he
said.
   In addition, there were reports that Trump must stick to a
business plan, adopt a system of accounting controls and change
accounting firms. A spokeswoman for Trump, Norma Foerderer, said
she could not confirm the reports.
   One source involved in the negotiations, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said it could take up to two months to prepare the
final documents on the financial rescue. The large number of banks
and attorneys involved will make the task time-consuming, the
source said.
   The financial foundation of Trump's property portfolio, much of
it amassed with borrowed money, has looked increasingly vulnerable
in recent weeks. A slump in the New York real estate market and
disappointing results from his Atlantic City casinos had put a cash
squeeze on Trump, endangering his ability to remain current on his
debts.
   The long-term $65 million bailout and debt restructuring package
contains numerous requirements, including one that Trump sell
assets to raise cash, according to the source.
   It was not believed that the agreement specifies which
properties Trump must sell.
   The lone holdout to the deal, Dresdner Bank AG of West Germany,
continued to withhold its consent to the deal, but attorneys
decided that Dresdner's endorsement wasn't essential, a banking
source said.
   Dresdner, whose $15 million loan to Trump is secured by the
first lien on Fifth Avenue's Trump Tower skyscraper, has opposed
placing a second lien on the building.
   It was considered possible that Dresdner might have second
thoughts and eventually agree to the deal during the time it takes
to complete the paperwork.

<HEAD>The National Plans $50 Million Commitment to Developing Print

<TEXT>
   The daily sports newspaper, The National, plans
to expand to 13 markets from its current roster of four by April
1991.
   Publisher Peter Price said Tuesday the newspaper will commit
more than $50 million toward equipping nine more printing sites.
The newspaper has been trying to find the right balance between
national and local sports coverage that will attract a loyal
readership.
   In addition, he said the newspaper plans to begin taking
classified advertising next month and will begin a late edition in
New York and Chicago in July to include late sports scores.
   Price's comments came amid continuing uncertainty about
prospects for the newspaper, which has been publishing editions in
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles since its launch Jan. 31 and
started a San Diego edition on Monday.
   It plans to add editions in six more markets by the end of the
year and another three in the first three months of 1991.
   Critics say they doubt there is a large enough audience for 40
to 48 pages of sports coverage that The National has been providing
every day.
   But Price said the paper is meeting its targets on circulation
and is ahead of schedule on advertising despite a generally weak
newspaper ad market.
   He said the owners of the newspaper, headed by Mexican media
baron Emilio Azcarraga, are commiting more than $50 million to
equip nine more printing sites by the end of March 1991 to handle
production of the four-color paper.
   That is in addition to the $25 million spent on launching the
newspaper in its first three cities. The National now is printed at
seven sites.
   Executives of the paper have said the Azcarraga group is
prepared to spend at least $100 million over five years to make The
National profitable.
   Price said the paper also plans to test home delivery in one or
two cities in September. The paper has been sold almost entirely at
newsstands, convenience stores and in vending machines.
   The newspaper's circulation has been a topic of some conjecture.
Price said Tuesday that The National is selling close to 200,000
copies daily on average, and expects circulation to approach
400,000 by the end of the year.
   But audited figures have not yet been made available. Some
industry executives have reportedly estimated the paper was selling
as few as 115,000 copies on average.
   ``We will feel better when they supply us with some good
circulation information,'' said Richard Weigand, senior vice
president and media director for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS-Pacific in
Torrance, Calif.
   A Saatchi client, Toyota Motor Sales, is one of the charter
advertisers in the newspaper.
   Price said the paper has been selling 5 to 5{ pages of ads a day
on average, more than the 4 pages expected, and that no advertisers
have reduced or cancelled their orders.
   The newspaper's expansion plans to new cities have been scaled
back since it was launched. Price said initial plans called for the
addition of two cities a month in late 1990 but said that plan
proved too ambitious, mainly because printing sites capable of
handling the job were not readily available.
   The expansion schedule through the end of the year now calls for
editions in San Francisco in July, Dallas in August, Detroit in
September, Boston in October, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market in
November and the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., market in December,
Price said.
   The three sites for early 1991 have not been announced, he said.

<HEAD>Citibank, MCI Challenge AT&amp;T Card</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citibank, the nation's largest credit-card
issuer, is taking on long-distance telephone king AT&amp;T in the
telephone credit-card market.
   Citibank has enlisted MCI Communications Corp., the
second-largest long-distance telephone company, to help it launch a
competitor to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Universal card. The
cards allow users to charge long-distance telephone calls on their
Visa or Mastercards.
   Citibank began notifiying customers earlier this month of the
service. Mastercard holders will be eligible for the service later
this summer, Richard Srednicki, Citibank's business manager for
Visa and Mastercard, said.
   AT&amp;T began offering Visa and Mastercard services in March to
those of its 70 million long-distance customers who are credit
worthy. The move represented a vast new entry into a highly
competitive and profitable industry.
   ``I don't think (Citibank) would have done it if it hadn't been
for AT&amp;T,'' said Spencer Nilson, publisher of an industry
newsletter called the Nilson Report.
   Citibank's offer is part of a service called VisaPhone that Visa
is testing for banks, said Visa spokesman Gregory Holmes. There are
124 million Visa cards in the United States.
   ``It's another example of how we're trying to open new markets
where bank cards are not being used to charge purchases,'' Holmes
said. He said 150 banks have expressed interest in the service, but
he didn't know which besides Citibank already are involved.
   Since its introduction, the AT&amp;T Universal Card has attracted
just over 1 million customers, said AT&amp;T spokesman Bruce Reid.
   ``I don't think we're going to react immediately to something
like (the Citibank card.) We're concentrating on trying to get a
new product out on the market right now,'' he said.
   Nilson said he doesn't expect Citibank's new service to
interfere with AT&amp;T's expansion into the $423 billion credit card
market. But he said Citibank can expect to find willing customers.
   A recent study by Nilson's newsletter predicted that within two
years, 14 percent of the 200 million Visa cards and Mastercards in
circulation will double as phone charge cards.
   In December, US Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance company, began
issuing a Visa card that also acts as a phone charge card.
   ``There's virtually no room for expansion in the number of
people (carrying credit cards), but there is room for expansion in
the number of cards people carry,'' Nilson said. ``The history of
the credit card market is that people are inclined to carry new

   American Express began offering similar service with MCI in the
early 1980s, said spokeswoman Nancy Muller.
   ``We offer American Express card members who have MCI
residential service the opportunity to consolidate their billing on
their American Express card bill,'' Ms. Muller said.

<HEAD>Chrysler Increases Holdings in Rental Car Business</HEAD>

   Chrysler Corp.'s has agreed to buy
Dollar Rent A Car, its third rental company, as part of an effort
to boost sales by showing off its cars and securing a position in
the rental market.
   ``The rentals showcase the vehicles to potential buyers and the
potential for fleet orders gives us a more solid production base,
keeping the plants operating smoothly,'' said Tom Jakobowski,
Chrysler spokesman.
   Chrysler subsidiary Pentastar Transportation Group Inc. on
Tuesday announced the deal. Chrysler used Pentastar to buy the
Thrifty and Snappy rental car systems in June 1989 for $236 million.
   Terms of the deal to buy Dollar were not disclosed. Chrysler
plans to complete the purchase by Aug. 15.
   Pentastar spokeswoman Meloyde Blancett-Scott, in Tulsa, Okla.,
said the car maker was looking to Dollar as a way to boost sales
and get a ``feel for the market.''
   Chrysler's car sales through mid-June lag 18 percent behind last
year.
   A New York-based stock analyst also said increasing Chrysler's
share in the rental market could make up for a slipping retail
share.
   ``Hypothetically, if you have a smaller share of the retail
market but a larger share of the rental market, then you end up
with a larger share altogether,'' said Charles Brady of Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   ``Through rentals, Chrysler can show off the cars. It gets them
on the roads and into the hands of executives who don't have the
time to test drive a car,'' Brady said. ``But they'll try a new car
if it's going to get them from one meeting to the next.''
   Dollar, the fourth largest car rental system worldwide, has
about 1,000 locations and an average rental fleet of 80,000
vehicles, 51,000 of them in North America. For fiscal 1989, Dollar
and its franchises reported revenues of more than $600 million.
   Dollar also operates in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean,
Australia and New Zealand, and is opening franchises in Africa and
the Middle East.
   Thrifty has more than 750 locations 45,000 vehicles, 37,000 in
North America. Snappy has 20,000 vehicles at 250 locations.
   Jakobowski said Dollar, like Thrifty and Snappy, would continue
operating independently through its franchises and under the Dollar
and EuroDollar names.
   Last October, Chrysler embarked on a program to slice $1.5
billion from its $26-billion annual budget. The company reported
$71 million in earnings for the first quarter, down 80 percent from
a year ago but more than most analysts expected.
   William E. Lobeck Jr., chairman of Pentastar, said Dollar's
owner and founder, Henry J. Caruso, will be retained as a
consultant.

<HEAD>Police Readying for Showdown With Shareholding Racketeers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As hundreds of companies prepare for shareholder
meetings Thursday, Japan's ``sokaiya'' racketeers are gearing up
for action again, seeking hush money to leave the sessions
undisturbed.
   And this year may bring a new group of racketeers, backed by
Japan's largest underworld syndicate as it seeks to establish a
foothold in the nation's capital, police say.
   ``Several sokaiya groups that are apparently backed by the
Yamaguchi-gumi have been increasingly active in western Japan, and
some of these are also believed to be opening new operations in the
Tokyo area,'' said a National Police Agency report.
   The 20,000-plus-member Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate has kept away
from Tokyo in the past but recently has been extending its forces
nationwide.
   Sokaiya racketeers often pose as analysts or consultants and
extort money from companies by threatening to make embarrassing
comments or otherwise disrupt their annual shareholders meetings.
   The National Police Agency report said there are 1,307 sokaiya
in Japan. Another 123 gangsters are involved in sokaiya activities
but are not considered full-time racketeers, it said.
   Tokyo, as Japan's financial center, is home to about 900 such
racketeers, said Yoshihiro Kondo, head of the Metropolitan Police
Department's organized crime division.
   Kondo said 2,600 officers will be called out Thursday to
discourage disturbances at the 780 general shareholders meetings
scheduled in Tokyo. A special sokaiya task force is set up in the
organized crime division each summer.
   In the early 1980s, police estimated there were 6,000 sokaiya
nationwide who hauled in about $390 million a year through
blackmail schemes. In one year alone, 243 sokaiya were arrested,
some for extortion and others for income tax evasion.
   Sokaiya activity appeared to taper off after a 1982 law made it
illegal to pay off sokaiya and increased the number of shares
required to attend shareholders meetings.
   ``But the sokaiya managed to bounce back,'' Kondo said.
   The decreased numbers of sokaiya in the police agency report,
which was released Monday, may reflect merely a greater difficulty
in identifying sokaiya, he said.
   Sokaiya groups recently have been moving away from general
meetings to concentrate on ``backstage'' activities, which include
coercing companies into subscribing to their publications as a form
of hush money, he said.
   Such publications generally contain material, often gleaned from
company employees, that could create a scandal for the company if
released widely, Kondo said.
   Businesses have banded together to fight the sokaiya by holding
their meetings on the same day. On Thursday, 1,666 companies
nationwide will hold shareholders meetings.
   Among them is Koito Manufacturing Co., which is waging a highly
publicized battle with American investor T. Boone Pickens. Pickens
owns a 26 percent share in the auto parts maker and has demanded a
seat on its board of directors.
   Last year, Pickens' calls for increased shareholders' rights
were echoed by a number of questioners from the floor _
tough-looking men in flashy suits who badgered Koito management for
about 90 minutes.
   Afterward, Pickens said they had asked some good questions, but
he said of the tactic, ``That's an interesting way to ask for an
income statement.''
   This year's Koito meeting, with its second round in the
high-profile Pickens conflict, will be a likely target for sokaiya,
Kondo said.

<HEAD>Bush Sharply Limits Offshore Oil Drilling; Mixed Response</HEAD>

   Environmentalists praised President
Bush's moratorium on offshore drilling but said it doesn't go far
enough. An industry group called it a mistake, and Democrats
accused the White House of playing politics.
   ``If the president really wants to protect the California coast,
he should make it permanent, not make it look as though he's just
delaying oil drilling off our coast until after the 1990 governor's
race and his own re-election campaign in 1992,'' Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy, a Democrat, said Tuesday.
   Bush suspended until at least the year 2000 new leases for
drilling off much of California, Oregon, Washington, southern
Florida and New England.
   He ordered further environmental studies to determine if
drilling leases might be offered after that.
   Bush's decision is ``a major step in the right direction,'' said
Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
   But she complained that Bush did not address some areas where
lease sales are upcoming, including the mid-Atlantic coast,
Alaska's Bristol Bay and northern Florida.
   The moratorium also doesn't stop drilling under way in the Gulf
of Mexico, off Alaska and off California.
   Nevertheless, the ban was a major shift in a U.S. policy to
decrease reliance on foreign oil. The nation imports half its oil.
The Reagan administration had favored opening the entire
continental shelf to oil and gas drilling.
   ``Locking up these energy-rich lands at a time when our
dependency on foreign energy is escalating is a serious mistake,''
the American Petroleum Institute said in a statement.
   Oil companies acknowledged public worry over oil drilling,
however.
   ``President Bush has recognized that most Americans are not
prepared at this time to develop certain environmentally sensitive
offshore areas,'' Los Angeles-based ARCO said in a statement.
``ARCO supports the president under these circumstances.''
   Democrats speculated that Bush wanted to help Republican
gubernatorial candidates in California and Florida who oppose
offshore oil drilling and could have been hurt politically by new
drilling after oil spills like the Exxon Valdez and Mega Borg.
   Some observers also said Bush may be thinking about his own
re-election prospects.
   ``The President's decision to delay leasing and development for
10 years off most of California's coast is an important concession
to the political reality, but it merely postpones the controversy
instead of solving it,'' said Ann Notthoff of the Natural Resources
Defense Council in San Francisco.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson faces former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein in the gubernatorial race. Both oppose offshore
drilling.
   Feinstein could have made a decision to allow drilling into ``a
first-rate campaign issue,'' but Wilson could have used it to show
his independence, said pollster Mervin Field, whose polls show
Californians opposed to offshore drilling 74 percent to 21 percent.
   Another California pollster, Steve Teichner, said the real
political implications would be for Bush. Bush carried only 51.1
percent of the California vote in 1988. ``It would have been a big
problem for him in 1992 if he had not protected the coast,''
Teichner said.
   In Florida, Republican Gov. Martinez opposes offshore drilling,
as do his leading Democratic opponents _ former Sen. Lawton Chiles
and Rep. Bill Nelson, who face each other in a Sept. 4 primary.
   Martinez was pleased with the moratorium, but not with Bush's
proposal that the state help buy back 73 leases sold to oil firms
for drilling off the Keys. Florida officials estimated the buyback
could cost $100 million to $200 million.
   ``The people of Florida should not be asked to bear what is
rightly a federal responsibility,'' Martinez said.
   Along the New England coast, Bush's ban affects Georges Bank, a
vital fishing ground east of Massachusetts' Cape Cod.
   ``Anybody who knows or cares about Georges Bank should be
delighted,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass. ``He's not even going
to be president by the year 2000. He's done all that he can for
Georges Bank on his watch.''
   California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a Democrat, called Bush's
actions ``a major victory for environmentalists.''
   ``We have won time, up to 10 years,'' Hayden said. ``So I'm
thankful for the actions in Washington, whatever the motives are.''

   The dollar was lower against most major foreign
currencies today in nervous European trading as dealers reacted to
President Bush's surprise statement that tax increases will be
necessary.
   ``The initial reaction to the tax news has been negative, but
the key factor is how hard U.S. corporations might be hit. The
market is still waiting to decide,'' said an analyst in Milan.
   Dealers said European markets were waiting for U.S. trading to
open before making any large moves.
   ``We're seeing small, nervous movements, but no big swings,''
said a Milan trader. ``The Europeans are going to let the United
States decide in which direction to send the dollar.''
   Traders said beliefs that the economic merger between East and
West Germany will lead to higher German interest rates added to the
dollar's slump.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.88 yen to a closing 154.35 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted lower at 154.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.6630 West German marks, down from 1.6690;
1.4055 Swiss francs, up from 1.4025; 5.5840 French francs, down
from 5.6035; 1.8710 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8790; 1,218.50
Italian lire, down from 1,222.25; and 1.1725 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1730.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7445, compared with $1.7360 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $349.95 a troy ounce, up
from $349.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $350.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $350, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.37 to close at a bid $352.11.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $4.82 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $4.79.

   Remarks by President Bush about higher tax revenues
helped send the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index soaring and the
dollar falling against the Japanese yen today, traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 740.98 points, or 2.29
percent, closing at 32,312.75. The index rose 447.58 points Tuesday.
   Many Japanese investors saw Bush's statement as indicating lower
U.S. interest rates, said Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi
Securities Co. Lower interest rates encourage stock investment but
make a country's currency less attractive.
   In a written statement issued in Washington Tuesday, Bush said
tax revenue increases must be included in any U.S.
deficit-reduction package, but he did not outline concrete steps.
   The Nikkei gained more than 400 points in the morning and
continued rising in the afternoon. Hasunuma said investors were
buying actively because of the start today of July stock trading
and because of shareholders meetings scheduled Thursday by many
Japanese companies.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said the yen's strength
also helped reassure market players and prompt active buying.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, up from Tuesday's 400 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 154.35 yen, down 0.88
yen from Tuesday's 155.23-yen finish. It opened at 154.33 yen and
ranged between 154.00 yen and 154.45 yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's decline in Tokyo came after investors
sold dollars on overseas markets overnight in expectation of lower
U.S. interest rates following Bush's remarks.
   In Tokyo, Japanese institutional investors, mainly life
insurance companies, were buying yen against the dollar, said
Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   ``Japanese investors now think the U.S. monetary policy is
moving toward relaxation,'' he said.
   About $12.16 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from
Tuesday's $9.37 billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.05 points at 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) from Tuesday's 87.12-point finish. The yield stood at 7.175
percent, up from the previous day's 7.160 percent.

   President Bush's decision to postpone oil
drilling off southern Florida leaves in limbo 73 oil leases already
bought from the government and is likely to prompt a court battle
over how much the leases are worth.
   Bush on Tuesday imposed a 10-year moratorium on oil development
in environmentally sensitive areas off southern Florida, as well as
off the coasts of California, Washington and New England.
   Unlike in California, where the leases under consideration have
yet to be put up for sale, a group of oil companies already own 73
leases off Florida within the 13 million acres under presidential
review. The leases were purchased in 1983 and 1984 for $108 million.
   Exploratory drilling would have begun immediately in two of the
sites if Bush had given the go-ahead.
   What happens to the leases now that Bush put a hold on further
oil activity there?
   On Tuesday, Bush announced his administration would begin
negotiations with the state of Florida to work out a joint effort
to purchase the leases from the oil companies that bought them for
$108 million. Federal officials have said they want Florida to bear
a substantial portion of the cost. But the state has indicated
buying the leases should be left to Washington, since the federal
government sold the leases.
   ``The people of Florida should not be asked to bear what is
rightly a federal responsibility,'' Gov. Bob Martinez said Tuesday.
   The oil companies could hold onto them, but most industry
experts doubt they will choose to do so. They cite the opposition
of environmentalists that they say is all but certain to intensify
the longer drilling is delayed.
   ``We're kind of in unchartered territory here,'' says Mike
Kimmit, a spokesman for Mobil Oil Co., which owns 22 of the leases.
He said the leases were acquired with the expectation that drilling
could be pursued, oil would be discovered and a profit could be
made.
   Mobil has been ready to begin exploratory drilling for some time
on one of the leases 60 miles west of the Florida Keys, but was
prevented from doing so because of state opposition, a
congressional moratorium and the review by Bush.
   Industry experts agree that if the leases are sold back to the
government the asking price will be much more than the $108 million
the companies paid the Interior Department for them. They may
demand $200 million or even more, suggest Interior officials.
   In addition to the original sale price, there are exploratory
and administration costs, various fees, interest on the money paid
to the government and possibly the value of any known resources,
says Rupert Turner, manager of government relations for Shell Oil
Co.
   Shell owns 16 of the leases. Other lease holders include Mobil,
Amoco, City Services, Chevron, Union Oil, Tenneco and Texaco.
   The Interior Department, which handles oil lease sales on the
Outer Continental Shelf, is likely to contest any claim by oil
companies that they be paid for the loss of oil reserves in the
lease areas.
   ``I don't believe there's a lot of oil in that area,'' said
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan when asked about the 73 leases in a
recent interview. Lujan said if the oil companies seek payment for
the loss of potential oil discoveries ``we would be talking about
hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.''
   The outcome likely will be settled in court, government
officials and industry representatives say.
   According to the law, the Interior Department could take back
the leases, but Lujan has ruled out unilateral action. ``I would
not want to be the one to cancel those leases. ... I would lose
credibility for (the sale of) future leases,'' he said.
   Lujan has suggested the state of Florida might purchase the
leases, but so far no agreement has been reached.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez told federal officials the state would
pay no more than $10 million as its share, while Lujan has said the
federal government wants to put in no more than $40 million.
   ``It's really the federal government's responsibility. They're
the ones who made the profits, who sold the leases and who should
pay the lion's share (in any buyback),'' says Estes Whitfield,
Martinez' director of environmental affairs.
   Whitfield maintains that the oil companies bought the leases
knowing there were environmental concerns that might prevent
drilling. Oil companies abandon many oil leases as a normal course
of exploring for oil, he said.

   Stock prices hovered uncertainly today as the
market absorbed the jolt of unwelcome earnings news from American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.44 to 2,835.89
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a slim edge on losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 472 up, 464 down and 503
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.86 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   AT&amp;T stock was by far the day's most active issue, tumbling 3&rsqb;
to 37~ on volume of more than 2.7 million shares.
   The selloff came after the company said it expects its earnings
for the second quarter to fall short of the 65 cents a share it
earned in the April-June period last year.
   AT&amp;T cited weaker-than-expected sales of some of its products,
which it attributed to sluggish economic activity and market
conditions.
   The drop in AT&amp;T, which is the nation's most widely held stock
with more than 2.6 million shareowners, accounted for virtually all
the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which has fallen sharply since early
this week on an earnings disappointment, lost another | to 51~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .17 to 192.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .46 at 356.34.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.72 points
to 2,842.33.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
706 up, 752 down and 529 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 141.42 million shares, against 133.10
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Robert Puette Named President of Apple's USA Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move that completed a tumultuous,
six-month shakeup of top management, Apple Computer Inc. hired
Robert Puette, a longtime Hewlett-Packard Co. executive, to lead
the company's domestic division.
   As president of Apple USA, Puette will be responsible for all
sales, marketing and support activities in this country.
   Puette, whose appointment was announced Tuesday, worked 24 years
at Hewlett-Packard, where he led the launch, development and
expansion of its worldwide personal computer business. Most
recently, he was general manager of Hewlett-Packard's Personal
Computer Group.
   ``Bob Puette's arrival marks a major milestone in the
development of Apple's USA business,'' said Michael Spindler,
Apple's chief operating officer. ``He has a proven ability to
effectively manage large, complex organizations. He's demonstrated
exceptional business and technical expertise in the global personal
computer market. And he's known for his strong and thoughtful
leadership.''
   Puette, 48, joins Apple on July 1. He fills a vacancy left by
the sudden resignation in January of Allen Loren. Puette will
report to Spindler, who was promoted to his position after Loren
resigned.
   Apple, ranked No. 2 behind Hewlett-Packard in the personal
computer market, badly needs help in the domestic market. The job
of Apple USA's president is considered so tough that several
leading candidates turned it down, industry sources said.
   High prices for its computers have lost the company sales in
homes, schools and small businesses.
   In addition, morale in Apple's U.S. operations has been shaken
by layoffs and employee unrest over various corporate issues,
including high salaries paid to key managers, analysts said.
   ``I think that this is the turning point for Apple USA,'' Puette
said. ``I think the turmoil is going to pretty well disappear and
you're going to see some strong marketing messages from the
company.''
   New, low-cost machines expected to be announced later this year
will have a significant impact on the market, Puette predicted.

   Unisys Corp. announced that Mitsui &amp; Co.
Ltd., a Japanese trading company, will buy $150 million worth of
Unisys convertible preferred stock and loan the computer maker $50
million.
   ``This transaction with our long-standing business partner in
Japan, Mitsui, is a significant step in our program to strengthen
the Unisys capital structure during this rebuilding year,'' James
A. Unrun, Unisys' president and chief executive officer, said
Tuesday.
   Mitsui and Unisys have a long-standing relationship that started
in 1958. Each company owns one-third of Nihon Unisys Limited, a $2
billion computer company in Japan, and each participates in
commercial ventures in other international markets, said J. Peter
Hynes, a Unisys spokesman.
   The agreement benefits both companies because Mitsui strengthens
its ties with its joint marketing programs worldwide, and the $200
million goes into Unisys' funds for general purposes, Unisys said.
   The preferred stock, in two series, will be convertible into
Unisys common stock at Mitsui's option. It will have a conversion
price of $20 per share for the $50 million in Series B stock, and
$21 per share for the $100 million in Series C stock.
   Both series of stock will pay quarterly dividends at 8~ percent
per year for the first five years and 9{ percent per year for the
next two years.
   The five-year loan is unsecured and will bear interest at the
rate of 11&rsqb; percent per year, payable quarterly.
   The sale of the shares and the transfer of funds is expected to
be completed this week.

<HEAD>Insurance Industry Still Wary Of Proposed Futures Contracts</HEAD>

   The Chicago Board of Trade has a selling job to
do even if federal regulators approve the exchange's request to
trade insurance risk alongside soybeans and Treasury bonds.
   Some people in the insurance industry expressed skepticism
Tuesday about the proposal to trade reinsurance futures. The
exchange argued that the innovative products would allow insurers
to stabilize underwriting risks, resulting in lower insurance costs
for consumers.
   ``My general feeling would be a wait-and-see attitude,'' said
Dan Kummer, vice president of administration and finance in the
business insurance division of Allstate Insurance Co.
   ``From my point of view, I'm not sure I would see this as a
replacement for some kinds of reinsurance,'' Kummer said in a
telephone interview from Allstate's headquarters in suburban
Northbrook.
   But Burton Gutterman, a Board of Trade director, told a news
conference the insurance industry will embrace the products once it
learns how to use them, just as once-skeptical banks have become
regular traders of the exchange's interest-rate futures.
   ``There are a lot of questions that have to be answered,'' he
said. ``That's a process the Board of Trade is committed to
pursuing.''
   Gutterman said the exchange on Monday submitted proposals for
two reinsurance contracts to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission for approval.
   The contracts would offer insurers a new way to reduce their
risk on auto and health insurance policies while creating new
markets for speculators.
   Reinsurance is the practice among insurance companies of selling
policies to other insurers _ reinsurers _ to spread the risk around.
   The proposed futures contracts would be agreements for future
deliveries of reinsurance certificates based on pools of auto and
health insurance policies. The value of a contract would represent
the difference between the premiums collected and claims paid on
the pool of policies.
   In an unusual twist, the Board of Trade would employ a `central
custodian' to inspect and qualify all policies.
   The custodian also would act as a clearinghouse for information
about premiums and claims, theoretically providing all market
participants with ``a level playing field,'' the exchange said in a
statement.
   The Board of Trade said that by buying and selling the
contracts, insurers could effectively reinsure some of their
policies through the exchange.
   ``The insurance markets represent a huge financial sector that
currently has very limited ways by which to manage its considerable
risk,'' Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a
statement.
   Gutterman said that pending CFTC approval of the contracts, the
Board of Trade would lobby state insurance commissioners to allow
insurers in their states to use the contracts for reinsurance.
   Kevin Hennosy, a spokesman for the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners, said he had not seen the Board of Trade
proposals.
   ``We certainly would have an interest in how this would impact
the consumer and how such a proposal would be regulated,'' Hennosy
said from his office in Kansas City, Mo.

   Stock prices declined slightly today as the
market absorbed the jolt of unwelcome earnings news from American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2.48 to 2,839.85
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 496 up, 640 down and
561 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 49.50 million shares at
midmorning.
   AT&amp;T stock was by far the day's most active issue, falling 2~ to
38&rsqb; on turnover of more than 6.5 million shares.
   The selloff came after the company said it expects its earnings
for the second quarter to fall short of the 65 cents a share it
earned in the April-June period last year.
   AT&amp;T cited weaker-than-expected sales of some of its products,
which it attributed to sluggish economic activity and market
conditions.
   The drop in AT&amp;T, which is the nation's most widely held stock
with more than 2.6 million shareowners, by itself more than
accounted for the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which has fallen sharply since early
this week on an earnings disappointment, lost another \ to 52\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .05 to 192.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.01 at 355.79.

   Democrats must agree to major spending cuts as
the price for President Bush's concession that taxes will have to
be raised to attack the budget deficit, a leading Senate Republican
said today.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., made the remark on CBS-TV's ``CBS
This Morning'' as negotiators from the White House and Congress
resumed their deficit-reduction negotiations.
   ``It's time to summit or get off the pot,'' Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, a Republican bargainer, told reporters as the closed-door
talks got under way.
   Bush said Tuesday that a budget pact will require ``tax revenue
increases,'' which Democrats hailed as an abandonment of his ``no
new taxes'' campaign pledge. Domenici, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, said the key question is not whether
GOP lawmakers will back the president's new position.
   ``It's whether Democrats will now restrain spending enough to
make a package that is indeed right for America,'' he said.
   On the same program, the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee said increased excise taxes will have to be part of any
deficit-reduction package.
   ``Excise taxes are going to be necessary in the equation because
you raise revenues immediately,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   The government levies excise taxes on fuels, cigarettes, liquor
and other items. Rostenkowski did not specify which tax increases
he favors, but in the past has advocated boosts in gasoline,
cigarette and alcohol levies.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois today gave a
cautious reading of Bush's statement. Appearing on NBC's ``Today''
show, Michel said ``the president didn't tell us yesterday, `The
first thing I want you to do is go down there and raise taxes.'''
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, appearing on the same
program, said that Bush, by his statement, ``has said publicly and
clearly that he believes new taxes are necessary.''
   ``There are going to be some hard hits,'' Michel said. ``The
president is taking a hit for the moment, I think temporarily.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters
today that continued stiff opposition among congressional
Republicans to a tax increase ``may make it difficult to pass''
whatever agreement is reached by negotiators. He added that any
agreement, including a tax increase, will have to be acceptable to
a majority of members of both parties in both houses.
   The search by White House and congressional negotiators for a
way to cut the mounting deficit was resuming today. The 1991
shortfall could exceed $200 billion _ well above the $74 billion
limit set by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Bush did not specify which taxes he would consider boosting, and
White House officials insisted that would be up to negotiators.
Nonetheless, lawakers agreed that the president's comments will
help the talks, which have dragged on fruitlessly since mid-May.
   ``It opens the door to serious negotiations at the summit,''
said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee.
   Many Democrats said Bush had done them a political favor as
well. They said he blurred an issue the GOP has used successfully
against Democrats across the country since President Reagan's
campaigns.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee and a former head of his state's Democratic Party, said
it would be ``implausible'' for Republicans to use the issue in
campaigns.
   ``What are they going to say when the president comes to their
district to campaign for them?'' Sasser said. ``Or will he come?''
   ``He's not only neutralized the issue for 1990, but perhaps
stewed up in the Republican Party a question about a lack of
identity,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
   Bush's statement also called for cuts in defense, domestic
programs, budget process changes and ``growth incentives,'' often
used to describe the capital gains tax reduction that Bush wants.
   But it was his support for tax increases that outraged
conservative Republicans. By Tuesday evening, 90 of the 176 House
Republicans had signed a letter to Bush saying they were ``stunned
by your announcement'' and calling such an increase unacceptable.
   ``Tax increases at the present time would undermine the economy
and substantially weaken it,'' said Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., who
circulated the message.
   Other Republicans insisted that in an effort to boost the
stalled budget talks, the president had merely restated his
longstanding promise to consider all options for saving money.
   ``I don't see how it's a change in anything,'' said Sen.
Domenici.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, said Bush's remarks did nothing
to eliminate the tax issue.
   His Senate counterpart, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the
president's statement ``may cloud the issue a little bit.'' But
Nickles, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
said most Republicans still would use the tax issue.
   ``Most of our challengers are more opposed to taxes than the
incumbents are,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose moderately
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, erasing most
of the previous session's losses in the corn and soybean markets.
   Wheat futures extended Tuesday's modest gains following the
Agriculture Department's acceptance of China's bid to buy about
140,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Some analysts predicted quiet trading today and Thursday ahead
of the USDA's first report on planted acreage for corn and soybeans.
   The report is scheduled for release after Thursday's close. It
is expected to show that heavy springtime rains in the Midwest
prevented farmers from planting as much corn as the USDA had
projected in March.
   A survey of analysts yielded an average corn-planting estimate
of 73.9 million acres compared with the USDA's March projection of
74.8 million and last year's 72.3 million.
   Analysts estimated soybean plantings at 59.6 million acres
compared with the USDA March projection of 59.4 million and last
year's total of 60.7 million.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.35\ a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 2} cents higher with July at $2.87} a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 1} cents higher with July at $1.38} a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $6.11 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after a mixed performance
Tuesday.
   Live cattle were .13 cent to .20 cent higher with August at
73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .05 cent
higher with August at 84.60 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .35 cent higher with August at 58.95 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent to .65 cent higher with July at 57.80 cents a
pound.

   The Supreme Court today upheld federal
policies that favor minorities in awarding broadcast licenses, a
majo victory for affirmative action.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Federal Communications
Comission policies do not discriminate unlawfully against whites.
   The court did not address the issue of women's rights, but FCC
affirmative action policies treat women and minorities almost
identically.
   In a case from Florida, the court allowed the commission to give
special, favorable consideration to minorities in awarding a
television station license.
   In a case from Connecticut, the court upheld the commission's
so-called distress-sale policy, which allows a broadcaster faced
with the loss of its license to sell to a minority-owned business
at 75 percent of market value.
   Today's ruling, which came in a consolidation of the two cases,
is a surprising victory for affirmative action from a conservative
Supreme Court.
   Throughout the history of the case, the FCC has argued women's
rights were at issue. The Associated Press initially reported that
the ruling affected both women and minorities. But in a footnote in
his 50-page majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
court did not address gender preferences.
   The footnote, referring to a broad FCC policy statement, says,
``The FCC also announced in its 1978 statement a tax certificate
policy and other minority preferences ... which are not at issue
today. Similarly, the commission's gender preference policy ... is
not before us today.''
   Legal experts said they are confident the ruling also will
permit the FCC to continue its policy of giving prefential
treatment as well to women seeking broadcast licenses, although the
court did not specifically address that issue.
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a communications lawyer, said he was
delighted with the ruling and said preferential treatment for women
applicants appears to be on safe ground.
   ``A similar policy for women, I believe, would also be upheld,''
he said.
   In its most important previous ruling on preferential minority
treatment by the federal government, a more liberal high court in
1980 upheld a public works program that set aside a percentage of
federal funds for minority contracts.
   More recently, however, the court has trimmed affirmative action
programs. Last year the justices struck down a Richmond, Va.,
program that set aside a percentage of local public works contracts
for minority-owned businesses. That ruling cast doubt on the
validity of numerous similar plans of states and cities but had no
bearing on federal programs.
   Today's ruling came as Congress and the Bush administration
continue negotiations to settle differences on the proposed Civil
Rights Act of 1990 _ a bill aimed at erasing the effects of the
earlier Supreme Court decisions weakening affirmative action
programs.
   Administration officials say they're concerned that provisions
of the bill permitting suits by individuals alleging hiring
discrimination are so strong in terms of potential damages that
they would, if enacted, lead businesses to reinstitute hiring
quotas.
   The bill as now written goes beyond the traditional
discrimination remedies of restoration of job and back pay.
   Today, the justices said they owe special deference to federal
programs that give preferential treatment to minorities.
   Brennan, writing for the court, said:
   ``It is of overriding significance in these cases that the FCC's
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved _
indeed mandated _ by Congress.
   ``We hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by
Congress _ even if those measures are not remedial in the sense of
being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or
societal discrimination _ are constitutionally permissible to the
extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the
power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of
those objectives.''
   Brennan was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   O'Connor, in an opinion joined by the other dissenters, said the
ruling violates ``fundamental principles'' requiring the government
to treat all Americans equally.
   ``The court departs from these fundamental principles and from
our traditional requirement that racial classifications are
permissible only if necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a
compelling interest,'' she said.
   The FCC said its policies, adopted in 1978, are intended to
promote diversity over the nation's airwaves by letting ``missing
voices'' be heard on radio and television.
   But the commission has not always supported affirmative action
wholeheartedly. When Ronald Reagan was president, the FCC
considered scrapping the policies.
   The current commission has called for broadening minority
representation in the broadcast industry, but the Bush
administration's Justice Department has disagreed with the FCC's
policies.
   Justice Department lawyers told the court that the affirmative
action policies are invalid because Congress did not initiate them
and design them narrowly to correct past bias.
   But Congress expressed itself on the issue in 1987 by passing an
appropriations bill that barred the FCC from spending any money to
review or scrap its affirmative action policies.
   The FCC's support for affirmative action has had limited
success. The commission said minorities control 3.5 percent of the
nation's radio and TV stations, compared to less than 1 percent in
1978.
   Other federal affirmative action programs have been adopted by
the Transportation and Defense departments and by the Small
Business Administration.
   In the Florida case, the FCC awarded Hispanic-owned Rainbow
Broadcasting Co. a new TV license in Orlando. A three-judge federal
appeals court panel in the District of Columbia _ upheld by the
high court _ ruled that a rival, Metro Broadcasting Inc., was not
denied the license unfairly.
   In the Connecticut case, a different panel of the same appeals
court struck down the FCC's distress-sale policy and ordered
Hispanic-led Astroline Communications Co. to surrender its license
for WHCT-TV in Hartford. The appeals court _ reversed by the
justices _ ruled for rival broadcaster Alan Shurberg, who is white.
   James L. Winston, executive director of the National Association
of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said the court's decision ``means the
FCC's ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward
without fear of constitutional challenge.
   ``The polices have been effective over the past 12 years in
increasing the number of minority-owned stations in general, and
particularly the ownership by African-Americans from 30 radio
stations and one television station to the point where we now have
182 radio stations and 17 television stations.
   Said Kernie Anderson, general manager of black-owned WDAS-FM-AM
in Philadelphia, one of the first stations sold under the distress
sale policy:
   ``This reflects a continuation of a policy that has benefited
not only African-Americans but women and the entire nation. It has
made for greater diversity in our industry. For the Supreme Court
to uphold the righteousness of what indeed was a just action by the
commission ... is appreciated by an African-American.''
   The cases acted upon today are Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC,
89-453, and Astroline Communications vs. Shurberg Broadcasting,
89-700.

   AT&amp;T today said its profit in the second quarter
likely will be lower than last year's in part because sales of
various products have fallen short of expectations.
   The softness will make it more difficult for American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. to meet its objective of achieving 10 percent to 12
percent growth in earnings this year, the company said in a
statement.
   But AT&amp;T said it stands by its earlier projection that net
income for all of 1990 would rise to a record level. This year's
profit is expected to surpass the 1989 earnings of $2.7 billion, or
$2.50 a share.
   The news sent the company's stock price sliding. In midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AT&amp;T shares were selling
for $38.62{, off $2.62{ from Tuesday's close. Earlier this morning,
the shares were off as much as $3.50.
   The company blamed market conditions and a sluggish economy for
weakening its product sales in the quarter that will end June 30.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Dick Gray said results from April and May
indicate sales to small and large U.S. businesses of telephone
equipment, including such things as electronic switchboards, have
been unexpectedly low.
   Sales of network telecommunications products, such as switching
equipment, cable and transmissions systems, also have been below
anticipated levels, Gray said. There has been some weakness in
sales to the federal government, he added.
   AT&amp;T also said sales in its computer division have lagged.
   Meanwhile, heavy demand for AT&amp;T's Universal Card has caused
expenses associated with processing card applications to rise in
the second quarter, the company said. AT&amp;T called the demand for
the new credit card, introduced in March, unprecendented and twice
the level expected.
   Analysts called AT&amp;T's announcement disappointing, but said they
believed the company's profit for the entire year would rise, as
AT&amp;T promised.
   George Kelly, of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said this was the first
time AT&amp;T announced its quarterly earnings would be below analysts'
expectations in the six years since it spun off its regional phone
operating companies.
   ``This has come as a real surprise to analysts who follow the
company,'' Kelly said.
   He attributed the slowdown in purchases of corporate phone
systems in part to the nationwide commercial real estate slump. As
fewer companies move to new quarters, fewer phone systems are sold,
he said.
   In addition, AT&amp;T has faced increased competitor in the office
phone market from Rolm, which is owned by International Business
Machines Corp. and Siemens AG of West Germany, Kelly said.
   In the market for central-office switches, which are the nerve
center of phone companies, AT&amp;T has seen increased competitor from
LM Ericsson of Sweden, Kelly said.
   ``AT&amp;T has always had a cost-structure problem in their
equipment business, and they have done a good job of controlling
that,'' he said. ``But we haven't really witnessed a downturn in
demand.''
   Stuart Crane, an analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co., said demand for
central-office switches has softened as the regional phone
operating companies have completed a cycle of buying new equipment.
   In last year's second quarter, AT&amp;T earned $699 million, or 65
cents a share, on revenue of $9.26 billion.
   In light of AT&amp;T's statement today, Kelly estimated earnings
this quarter will be 63 cents a share, while Crane put the figure
at 62 cents.

Stock Exchange Wednesday, undermined by weakness in the stock index
futures market.
   Dealers said shares slipped back when the premium on the June
stock index futures contract shrank to stand near parity with the
cash market.
   ``As the premium in the futures collapsed, the cash market
decided to tumble in line with it,'' a trader said.
   Market watchers said the prospect of a weak dollar also raised
concern about the vulnerability of companies that are largely
dependent on their dollar earnings.
   A poor start on Wall Street didn't help. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 6.43 points at 2,835.15 at the close of
the London day.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 26.3
points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,373.5, a bit above the session low of
2,369.1.
   The market peaked at 2,394.1 in the first 10 minutes of trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 24.0 points at
1,902.6 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell
12.74 points to close at 1,284.78.
   Volume came to 389.0 million shares, compared with 461.2 million
shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>Ted Turner Gets 66 Percent Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner's total pay increased 66 percent to
$729,952 last year, boosted in part by an incentive plan adopted by
his company's board of directors in 1989, according to a Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. proxy statement.
   The TBS chairman, who owns about $1.5 billion worth of Turner
Broadcasting's outstanding stock, earned a $197,513 bonus in 1989.
That brought his total cash compensation to $729,952, compared with
total cash compensation of $440,649 in 1988, according to the proxy
statement released Tuesday.
   The cable television company, which owns Superstation WTBS in
Atlanta and produces the Cable News Network, CNN Headline News and
Turner Network Television, lost $70.6 million in 1989 as its
revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time.
   Also in the proxy statement, Turner Broadcasting said it will
ask shareholders on July 23 to approve a plan that would increase
the number of authorized shares of common stock.
   The company proposed to triple the number of authorized shares
of its Class A common stock from 25 million shares to 75 million
shares and double Class B shares from 150 million to 300 million.
   The moves would not dilute Turner's majority voting control in
the company. He currently owns 39.7 percent of the company's
outstanding common equity and 62.9 percent of the voting power.

   Stock prices gained ground today, weathering
some unwelcome earnings news from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.85 to 2,857.18
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 757 up, 578 down and
558 unchanged.
   AT&amp;T stock was by far the day's most active issue, falling 2\ to
39 on turnover of nearly 10 million shares.
   The selloff came after the company said it expects its earnings
for the second quarter to fall short of the 65 cents a share it
earned in the April-June period last year.
   AT&amp;T cited weaker-than-expected sales of some of its products,
which it attributed to sluggish economic activity and market
conditions.
   The drop in AT&amp;T, which is the nation's most widely held stock
with more than 2.6 million shareowners, weighed down the Dow Jones
industrial average by close to 4{ points.
   But analysts said buyers moved cautiously into some other stocks
after it became evident that the AT&amp;T setback wasn't starting a
general rush to sell stocks.
   Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which has fallen sharply since early
this week on an earnings disappointment, lost another \ to 52&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.99 to 193.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .36 at 356.44.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.24 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Officials Report Breakthrough In Trade Talks; Bush, Kaifu Confer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between Japan and the United States on
structural trade reforms progressed late Wednesday night with a
last-minute breakthrough on the issue of increasing Japan's public
works spending, officials said.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu conveyed Japan's final offer on the
issue to President George Bush in a telephone conversation late
Wednesday night
   Bush said he would hear details of the talks from U.S. officials
and expressed appreciation for Kaifu's efforts, according to a
high-ranking Foreign Ministry official.
   ``This represents a breakthrough,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Without an agreement on public works
spending tonight, I doubt we could finish the talks by tomorrow.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said they could not confirm reports
that Japanese and U.S. officials had agreed on a final figure of
$2.77 trillion in public works spending over the next 10 years.
   Local media, citing unidentified government sources, said Kaifu
and other top Japanese officials, meeting in a last-ditch move to
salvage the talks, had agreed to increase their original proposal
of $2.68 trillion by $96.77 billion.
   U.S. officials accepted the proposal, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   The United States claims that Japan needs to offset its high
savings rate, which gives Japanese businesses a relatively cheaper
source of capital than their U.S. counterparts, with more
government spending, which can boost such capital costs as interest
rates.
   Washington had requested that Tokyo commit itself to spending at
least $3.22 trillion over the next decade.
   Japanese officials expressed concern that such a large increase
would stimulate inflation.
   Earlier Wednesday night, U.S. officials had said the talks were
at an impasse due to conflicts over public works spending and other
issues, despite a decision by Bush to take stronger action to cut
the U.S. budget deficit.
   A senior U.S. official participating in the talks complained
that Japan had failed to show ``political will'' to match Bush's
decision on Tuesday to accept tax increases to help cut the U.S.
deficit.
   ``It took more political courage to raise (tax) revenues than it
would to increase public spending,'' the official said on condition
he not be named. ``The president made an important decision. We
hope our Japanese friends realize that.''
   Doing more to cut its budget deficit is one of Washington's key
commitments in the current round of trade talks, called the
Structural Impediments Initiative.
   The talks are intended to attack Japan's $49 billion surplus in
trade with the United States by taking steps to remedy fundamental
problems in both countries _ such as the U.S. budget deficit and
Japan's tough-to-crack business systems _ seen as hindering trade
and competitiveness.
   This week's talks were to prepare a final version of an interim
report issued in April.
   Officials said they expected to work through the night in order
to complete the report by midday Thursday. Prior commitments on
both sides required that the current talks end then or resume
sometime next week, they said.
   The meetings originally were scheduled to end Tuesday but have
dragged on as officials haggled over the many topics under
discussion.
   The U.S. official said progress had been made on opening Japan's
products distribution system and improving land use and customs
facilities and operations. There also was progress on measures by
Washington to curb demand for imports, improve competitiveness of
U.S. products and slash the federal budget deficit.
   But he said negotiators were still split on issues related to
exclusionary business practices and the speed of processing patent
applications, and over the private right to take legal action over
unfair business practices.
   Japanese officials were dissatisfied with U.S. proposals on
easing export controls for oil and strategically sensitive
products, he said.
   Both sides say they are anxious to reach agreement before the
July 9 summit of the seven major industrialized democracies in
Houston.

<HEAD>Koito Says Only 2 Percent of Stockholders Support Pickens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Koito Manufacturing Co. said Wednesday it has
overwhelming support from most of its shareholders to reject the
demand by T. Boone Pickens Jr. for a voice in running the company.
   Pickens and 52 other Americans own 26 percent of the total
shares in the Japanese auto parts maker.
   For its general sareholders meeting Thursday, Koito said, it has
received proxies representing 83 percent of the other shares
supporting its position against Pickens. Proxies representing 2
percent of those other shares support Pickens, it stated.
   Pickens and his allies are in Japan for the meeting, where they
plan to renew demands for four seats on Koito's 20-member board of
directors.
   ``We are gratified at the overwhelming support that management
has received from our shareholders,'' Tomoatsu Aoyama, a Koito
director, was saying in the company's statement.
   ``After corporate raider Boone Pickens' lengthy and highly
visible campaign to attack Koito, disrupt our business, and create
controversy to further his greenmail scheme, it is revealing that
he can obtain the support of fewer than 2 percent of the other
shareholders,'' he said.
   Mark Helmke, a representative of Pickens, said he was not
surprised at the small showing overall for the Texas oilman. But,
he said, Pickens' Boone Co. had received support from more than
half of the 4 million or so ``average Japanese investors.''
   ``Our support is from the average investor,'' Helmke said.
``Koito's support is from the keiretsu.''
   Keiretsu are corporate networks bound by mutual shareholdings,
financial or personnel ties. In Koito's case, Toyota Motor Corp.,
Japan's biggest automaker, owns about 20 percent of the company's
stock and buys about half the auto lighting equipment it sells.
   Pickens says keiretsu tend to exclude outsiders, especially
foreigners. He says Koito's status as a subcontractor in Toyota's
keiretsu squeezes Koito profits, depriving him of a fair return as
a stockholder.
   ``By losing the vote tomorrow, we will show that the keiretsu
system is stacked against the small investor in Japan as it is
against the United States,'' said Helmke.
   Koito has maintained that Pickens is really interested in having
the company buy back his shares at a premium _ a charge he denies _
and has rejected his demands for a greater say in running the
company.

<HEAD>State Sues Accountant Who Backed Lincoln Junk Bond Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of California today sued Lincoln
Savings and Loan chief Charles H. Keating Jr. for alleged fraud in
the sale of $250 million in now-worthless junk bonds.
   The accounting company that backed claims about the bonds'
safety was also named as a defendant.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp said the defendants include
Jack Atchison, the employee of the Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting
firm who handled the account of American Continental Corp.,
Lincoln's parent company.
   The high-risk, high-interest rate bonds, sold mainly to elderly
southern Californians at Lincoln branches, were issued by American
Continental.
   Federal regulators say the failure of Lincoln may cost taxpayers
$2 billion.
   ``Charles Keating and his associates at American Continental
Corporation were running a huge financial con game, and sucking the
assets out of Lincoln Savings to sustain their operations,'' Van de
Kamp said.
   Atchison was later hired by American Continental for $900,000 a
year, four times what he was making at Arthur Young.
   ``It takes no great insight to understand why he was worth that
princely sum to ACC,'' Van de Kamp said.
   The suit, filed in state court in Orange County, seeks
restitution of the $250 million in bonds from Keating, other
American Continental officers and directors, Atchison, and Arthur
Young, which is now doing business as Ernst &amp; Young.
   Van de Kamp said he will seek civil penalties that could range
from $50 million to $100 million.
   A Keating attorney, James Ham, said today that many of the legal
actions against Keating, including a $2.1 billion lawsuit by the
Resolution Trust Corp. in Phoenix, Ariz., were ``grandstanding''
because his client is broke.
   Van de Kamp agreed in part, saying: ``There's little hope that
any (American Continental) assets will be left over to repay the
bond holders. That is why we have taken the time and expense to
thoroughly investigate the liability of others who might be
responsible.''
   A call for comment from Ernst &amp; Young was not immediately
returned by the firm's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Coleman.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a late wave of
profit-taking erased strong midday gains in the corn and soybean
markets.
   Susan Leighty, a grain analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the net outcome _ little change in prices _ reflected
traders' reluctance to establish new market positions ahead of
Thursday's Agriculture Department report on planted acreage and
grain stocks.
   ``It's not surprising it came down,'' she said.
   Corn and soybeans rallied strongly at midday amid new forecasts
for extremely hot, dry weather due in the western Corn Belt from
the Southwest. An extended Midwest heat wave could harm the young
crops.
   At the close, wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to { cent

<HEAD>Severance Package for Ousted Chairman About $10 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter A. Cohen, who was ousted as chairman of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. earlier this year, will receive a
severance package worth about $10 million, individuals familiar
with the pact said Wednesday.
   Cohen was ousted by American Express Co.'s chairman, James D.
Robinson III, as part of an overhaul designed to stem mounting
losses and morale problems at the nation's second largest
securities firm.
   The severance package completes the much publicized separation
as the firm continues a major restructuring that includes returning
to its old Shearson Lehman Brothers name.
   Cohen will receive $2.6 million in severance pay plus stock and
options amassed during a 20-year career that values the total
package at about $10 million, according to people familiar with the
package, who asked not to be named.
   The individuals said the severance pay was calculated at about
one month's pay for each year of service, or about $130,000 a month.
   Shearson, though, technically doesn't sever all ties with Cohen
under the package. The firm agreed to retain Cohen as a consultant
until March 1991 and pay for an office and secretary outside
Shearson's headquarters. That will allow Cohen to receive some
benefits to which he is entitled.
   ``We believe it is a fair and equitable settlement that
recognizes Mr. Cohen's significant contributions to Shearson Lehman
Hutton over 20 years of dedicated service,'' Gary Beller, American
Express executive vice president and general counsel, said in a
statement.
   ``We wish him well in his future endeavors,'' the statement said.
   Other American Express and Shearson officials declined to
comment.
   Cohen, 43, was ousted from the firm in January and replaced by a
top American Express executive, Howard L. Clark Jr.
   Cohen was instrumental in Shearson's expansion into the
investment banking field in 1984 with the acquisition of Lehman
Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He also led the January 1988 acquisition of
defunct brokerage E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. for $962 million.
   The latter deal along with Shearson's failed role in the RJR
Nabisco Inc. takeover have been blamed for many of Shearson's
current problems.
   Shearson lost $915 million in the first quarter of 1990, the
largest loss ever on Wall Street. Most of the loss was to pay for a
restructuring that included thousands of layoffs and the
elimination or reduction of several businesses.
   American Express plans to acquire all the Shearson stock it does
not own.
   Shearson earlier this month said it was grouping into two
divisions from four: Shearson Lehman Brothers for individual
investing and asset management, and Lehman Brothers for investment
banking and capital markets activities. The full firm will be known
as Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The severance agreement with Cohen was presented by American
Express' board to Cohen about two months ago. As part of the
package, Cohen must repay an oustanding loan to Shearson taken to
purchase company stock about two years ago, about equal to the $2.6
million in severance pay.
   Additionally, Cohen is prevented from suing directors and
officers of Shearson, American Express and members of their
families.

   Last winter's bitter cold spell cost
Florida's commercial foliage industry about $175 million, industry
officials say.
   Dade County alone suffered damages of about $100 million to
tender tropical plants, trees and shrubs, said the Florida
Nurserymen and Growers Association, based in Orlando.
   ``The numbers aren't quite as large as we had anticipated right
after the freeze, but they still have to be considered
conservative,'' said Earl Wells, executive vice president of the
association.
   Foliage prices rose an average 15 percent because of shortages
of plants, particularly palms and other tropical trees, Wells said
Tuesday.
   Florida is the nation's leading foliage producer, with about
5,800 commercial nurseries and $1 billion a year in revenues,
according to the state Division of Plant Industry.

<HEAD>Says Underwriting Profit Dropped By 45 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance market Lloyd's of London announced a 45
percent drop in underwriting profit Wednesday for its most recent
reporting year, largely because of asbestos and pollution claims in
the United States.
   Lloyd's said underwriting profit totaled 411.7 million pounds or
$716 million in 1987 compared with 744.5 million pounds a year
earlier.
   Lloyd's announces earnings figures three years late to give it
time to get a more accurate idea of the claims that will fall due
on policies written during those years.
   The company said pretax profit dropped 22 percent to 509.1
million pounds or $886 million, from 649.4 million pounds a year
earlier.
   Total net premium income, an insurance industry version of
revenues, rose 13.5 percent to 4.2 billion pounds or $7.3 billion,
from 3.7 billion pounds in 1986.
   Chairman Murray Lawrence said the insurance market faces even
leaner times over the next two reporting years.
   When the 1988 claims are tallied, he said, it ``appears as
though it will be profitable but it will reflect the impact of
overcapacity throughout the industry which became evident that
year.''
   For 1989, he predicted an overall loss for the market. Lawrence
cited an unusual number of major claims which were particularly
damaging since the disasters occurred at a time of ``keenly
competitive'' premium rates.
   Lawrence said that although the 1987 results showed a reasonable
overall profit, there was some variance between markets. While
aviation and motor markets produced impressive profits and marine
showed results in line with 1986, non-marine insurance underwriting
results were disappointing, Lawrence said.
   The drop in non-marine underwriting results came from asbestos
claims and pollution problems on U.S. business, he said.
   Lloyd's reports profits once a year.
   The figures were converted at the current exchange rate of $1.74
to the pound.

<TEXT>
   Former Vernon Savings &amp; Loan owner Don Dixon
pleaded innocent Wednesday to 38 federal charges in the collapse of
his thrift three years ago.
   The charges include allegations that he illegally raised money
for national political figures.
   A trial date of Aug. 20 was set by U.S. District Judge Joe Fish.
Dixon remained free on personal recognizance.
   Dixon was indicted June 13 in the $1.3 billion collapse of
Vernon Savings and Loan in 1987. Federal regulators at the time
called Vernon a prime example of the abuses in the savings and loan
industry.
   Dixon, 50, has maintained he is a scapegoat for the government's
sloppy handling of the S&amp;L crisis.
   The indictment alleged that Dixon used thousands of dollars from
Vernon Savings on pleasure trips, prostitutes and illegal
contributions to politicians, including former House Speaker Jim
Wright and Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York
who is now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Prosecutors have said the recipients did not know that the funds
came from illegal sources.
   Five other Vernon officials have pleaded guilty to various
crimes and one, former President Patrick G. King, was sentenced
last year to five years in prison. Former chairman Woody F. Lemons
was sentenced in April to 30 years in prison.
   A consultant and two Vernon borrowers also have pleaded guilty
in thrift-connected cases.

<HEAD>Construction Contracts Rise In May Due To Public Works, Dodge Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Embargoed by source until 6:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three public works projects totaling $300
million helped boost the value of new construction contracts in May
by 6 percent from the month before, the F.W. Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill said Wednesday.
   The Dodge Index of construction contracting, which uses 1982 as
its base of 100, rebounded to 155 in May, compared with April's
four-year low of 147.
   The seasonally adjusted indicator of future construction
activity represents the value of newly started projects of all
kinds.
   In May, contracting for public works and utility projects grew
12 percent to its best level this year. The projects included three
lock-dam structures being built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
along waterways in Oregon, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, Dodge
said.
   Though these projects gave the May figures a lift, the level of
general building activity also rose, Dodge said. Non-residential
building contracting advanced 6 percent, while residential building
rose 4 percent.
   Despite May's increase, year-to-date contracting activity was 7
percent below the activity in the same five months of 1989, Dodge
said. The largest shortfall was in the Northeast, where the value
of newly started work was off its year-ago pace by 24 percent.
   Construction in the North Central region was ahead 5 percent so
far this year, the West remained even and the South was down 10
percent, Dodge said.

<HEAD>Oil Price Slump Continues</HEAD>

   Energy futures prices continued their downward
drift Wednesday led by a steep slide in wholesale gasoline prices.
   Trading picked up to about average volume after recent sluggish
sessions on the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy analysts said.
   The contract for July delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
tumbled 1.83 cents to settle at 59.49 cents a gallon, expanding on
Tuesday's loss of 0.95 cent. Contracts for later delivery also
finished significantly lower.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the July home heating oil contract slid 0.56 to 47.93 cents a
gallon after falling 0.43 cent Tuesday. Contracts for delivery
during August through October posted similar declines.
   The August contract of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, shed another 46 cents to close at $16.68 a
42-gallon barrel. That was wider than Tuesday's drop of 24 cents.
Other nearby crude contracts fell.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.500 per
1,000 cubic feet. It was the lowest settlement for the near-month
contract since the New York Merc began trading natural gas in early
April. It was down from the closing level of $1.507 Tuesday.
   Jim Fiedler, an energy specialist for E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said the selloff in gasoline was the catalyst for the
market's overall weakness. He said brokers are puzzled because gas
demand is still lagging despite the start of the peak summer
driving season.
   Weekly statistics released late Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute indicated gas demand is running about 5 percent
behind last year.
   Crude, meanwhile, has been under pressure because there is a
glut of oil available, which hasn't shown signs of abating, Fiedler
said.

   News that AT&amp;T's second-quarter profit will be
lower than a year ago _ and below analysts' expectations _ sent the
price of the nation's most widely held stock sliding Wednesday.
   The announcement by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. was the
first time since the 1984 breakup of the former Bell System that
the nation's largest phone company has given advance warning of a
lower profit.
   The company blamed the expected earnings slide in the quarter
ending Saturday partly on lower-than-expected sales of telephone
equipment.
   AT&amp;T would not predict how much the drop would be. It said it
would release second-quarter results in mid-July.
   Analysts said the news was surprising, but they did not doubt
AT&amp;T's forecast that profit for the entire year would be at a
record high.
   ``All this suggests to me is a temporary (profit) margin
squeeze, with a reversal over the next six months,'' said Stuart
Crane, who follows AT&amp;T for the investment firm Gruntal &amp; Co.
   ``The fundamentals of AT&amp;T are strong,'' he said. ``I don't
agree with throwing out the stock.''
   In nationwide New York Stock Exchange trading, AT&amp;T shares
closed at $39.12{, down $2.12{ from Tuesday's close. Earlier, the
shares were down as much as $3.50. About 11.5 million shares
changed hands Wednesday, nearly nine times the average daily volume.
   AT&amp;T estimates it has 2.5 million shareholders, more than any
other U.S. company. About 40 percent of the shares are held by
individuals.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Dick Gray said results from April and May
indicate sales to U.S. businesses of equipment such as electronic
switchboards and private phone systems have been unexpectedly low.
   Sales of products to telephone operating companies, such as
switching equipment, also have been less than anticipated, Gray
said, as have been sales to the federal government.
   AT&amp;T also said sales in its computer division have lagged.
   The company said the lower equipment sales were due to market
conditions and a sluggish economy.
   AT&amp;T does not disclose how much of its profit it derives from
individual business segments.
   Meanwhile, heavy demand for AT&amp;T's new Universal Card has caused
expenses associated with processing applications for the credit
card to rise, the company said.
   AT&amp;T called demand for the card twice the level expected. The
card, which combines a phone charge card with a MasterCard or Visa,
was introduced in March.
   The company said the expected decline in second-quarter earnings
will make it more difficult to meet its objective of 10 percent to
12 percent profit growth this year. But it stands by its earlier
projection that net income for all of 1990 will break last year's
record high. In 1989, AT&amp;T earned $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share,
on revenue of $36 billion.
   For several years, AT&amp;T has been cutting costs by reducing
employment levels.
   In April, AT&amp;T reached agreement with its unions to offer early
retirement to about 34,000 workers. The program follows one offered
last year to managers, under which about 12,000 opted for early
retirement. AT&amp;T has about 315,000 employees.
   AT&amp;T also plans to continue to move workers into sales and
marketing jobs to increase revenue, Gray said.
   George Kelly, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., attributed the
slowdown in sales of corporate phone systems partly to the
nationwide commercial real estate slump. As fewer companies move to
new quarters, fewer phone systems are sold, he said.
   AT&amp;T also faces increased competition in the office phone market
from Rolm, which is owned by International Business Machines Corp.
and Siemens AG of West Germany, Kelly said.
   In the market for central-office switches, the nerve center of
phone companies, AT&amp;T has seen increased competition from LM
Ericsson of Sweden, Kelly said.
   Gruntal's Crane said demand for central-office switches has
softened as the regional phone operating companies have completed a
cycle of buying new equipment. But he predicted an upturn in two to
three years as AT&amp;T comes out with new optical-based central
switches. The company is several years ahead of competitors in this
advanced technology, he said.
   In last year's second quarter, AT&amp;T earned $699 million, or 65
cents a share, on revenue of $9.26 billion.
   In light of AT&amp;T's statement, Kelly estimated earnings this
quarter would be 63 cents a share, while Crane put the figure at 62
cents. Gregory Sawers, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.,
estimated 60 cents.

<HEAD>BFI Agrees to Supply Alcoa with Recycled Aluminum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Browning Ferris Industries announced on Wednesday
an agreement to sell more than 1 billion used aluminum cans yearly
to Alcoa Recycling Co.
   ``Our agreement with Alcoa is a major milestone to boost
aluminum can recycling nationwide,'' said BFI Chairman William D.
Ruckelshaus, the former head of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.
   Houston-based BFI, one of the world's largest waste handling
companies, collects cans through organized recycling efforts in 170
programs nationwide involving 1.4 million households. Last year,
the programs brought in about 1 billion cans, or 2 percent of the
recycled cans.
   Until now, each of the programs has been selling the aluminum
individually.
   ``This assures us a market, long-term, for the cans, and it
assures Alcoa a source of supply, long-term, for the cans,'' said
BFI spokesman Peter Block.
   As part of the agreement, the two companies also will work to
expand the collection programs.
   ``Municipal curbside recycling programs represent a major new
source of aluminum available for recovery,'' said Alcoa Recycling
President George Cobb, calling recycling an ``above-ground aluminum
mine.''
   Alcoa Recycling paid $232 million for 17.1 billion cans in 1989,
spokesman Al Posti said from the company's Pittsburgh headquarters.
About half of the sheet aluminum Alcoa sells for cans comes from
recycling, he said.
   Alcoa will pay BFI market price for the cans.
   The deal with Alcoa is the third agreement BFI has reached to
get rid of the waste it collects. Last year Wellman Inc. agreed to
take recyclable plastics. In June, Weyerhaeuser Paper Co. agreed to
take 10,000 tons of paper a month in the western United States.

   Apparel manufacturer Salant Corp. sought refuge
in bankruptcy court Wednesday after struggling unsuccessfully with
debts incurred in buying a larger rival two years ago.
   It was the second filing under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code for the New York-based clothing company, whose
nationally known brands include Dr. Denton sleepwear, John Henry
shirts and Lady Manhattan sportswear.
   Salant attributed its troubles to weakness in the retail
business at a time of year that is always the slowest for the
company.
   The fate of Salant furnished another example of what can happen
when companies fail to generate enough cash to pay for takeovers
financed with borrowed money. The retail industry, on which Salant
relies for its business, has had its share of victims, including
Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied department store divisions and
Ames Department Stores Inc.
   Ray W. Williams, Salant's chairman and chief executive, said in
a news release that ``continued softness in the retail apparel
market during the traditional low point of our seasonal business
has made it impossible for us to satisfy our obligations to our
lenders on a timely basis.''
   The bankruptcy filing was foreshadowed in mid-June when Salant
diclosed discussions with lenders about refinancing its debts.
   That news came as Salant revealed it was in default on $10.8
million in principal and interest on bank loans and couldn't cover
$1.9 million due on certain bonds.
   The company said then that it was looking into alternatives,
including a second bankruptcy filing.
   Salant emerged from its first bankruptcy case three years ago.
Shortly thereafter it began building a stake in Manhattan
Industries Inc., a much bigger competitor that it eventually bought
for $105 million in the spring of 1988.
   Retail analysts said there has been a perception within the
trade that Salant undertook too big a task when it bought Manhattan
in an effort to broaden its line of national brands.
   Until the takeover, Salant mainly made private label clothing
for retailers such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co. It
also has the Thomson Trouser Co.
   In buying Manhattan, Salant gained ownership of various Perry
Ellis lines, Manhattan shirts, Lady Manhattan sportswear and the
Vera label of scarves and other items.
   The pessimism about Salant's prospects have been reflected in
the company's stock price. It closed at $2.87{ a share in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, off 25 cents from
Tuesday and down from a high of $26.87{ in the last 52 weeks.
Salant's first-quarter loss widened to $2.3 million from the
$427,000 loss a year earlier.
   Edward Johnson, director of the Johnson Redbook Service of
Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in New York, said Salant's chairman
overreached in buying Manhattan and, in retrospect, paid too high a
price.
   ``His appetite was a little too strong,'' Johnson said.
   Still, he believes Williams stands a decent chance of turning
Salant around. He noted that Williams proved himself an able
manager as president of the Farah Manufacturing Co.
   ``He's a capable man,'' said Johnson.
   In the news release, Williams said the company believes it can
continue operating effectively while negotiating with its creditors
and attempting a court-supervised reorganization. Salant's Denton
Mills Inc. subsidiary was included in the bankruptcy filing.
   He said The CIT Group-Factoring has agreed to forward $100
million in working capital to Salant, an arrangement which must be
approved by the bankruptcy court. CIT is a company that acts as a
financial middleman in transactions between apparel manufacturers
and retailers.
   Alan Millstein, publisher of the New York newsletter Fashion
Network Report, said Salant has had a history of missteps, with the
Manhattan takeover only the latest misbegotten maneuver.
   ``It was a case of a minnow swallowing a whale and nearly
choking to death on it,'' Millstein said. ``The acquisition of
Manhattan Industries was almost a total disaster. The Perry Ellis
name was very costly.''
   Salant unloaded money-losing portions of Perry Ellis since the
1988 acquisition and only retained the profitable licenses.
   Millstein said in the 1960s Salant had a shot at becoming as
powerful a force in men's wear as Levi Strauss &amp; Co. became with
blue jeans. Sales volumes of the two companies were running neck
and neck.
   Salant missed its chance by not plunging deeply into denim as
Levi did, Millstein said.

   Stock prices pulled out of their recent slump
with a rally Wednesday, shrugging off unwelcome earnings news from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 59.40
points over the past three sessions, climbed 19.80 to 2,862.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
851 up, 597 down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.62 million
shares, against 141.42 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 172.73 million shares.
   AT&amp;T stock was by far the day's most active issue, falling 2&lsqb; to
39&lsqb; on turnover of more than 11.5 million shares.
   The selloff came after the company said it expects its earnings
for the second quarter to fall short of the 65 cents a share it
earned in the April-June period last year.
   AT&amp;T cited weaker-than-expected sales of some of its products,
which it attributed to sluggish economic activity and market
conditions.
   The drop in AT&amp;T, which is the nation's most widely held stock
with more than 2.6 million shareowners, weighed down the Dow Jones
industrial average by close to 4\ points.
   But analysts said buyers moved cautiously into some other stocks
after it became evident that the AT&amp;T setback wasn't starting a
general rush to sell.
   Recent recession fears also seemed to be abated by the Commerce
Department's report that the index of leading economic indicators
rose 0.8 percent in May.
   The increase in the index, which is designed to function as a
kind of economic crystal ball, came in toward the high end of
advance estimates.
   Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which has fallen sharply since early
this week on an earnings disappointment, lost another \ to 52\ in
active trading.
   Pharmaceutical issues were strong, bolstered by bright
appraisals from many analysts of the industry's profit outlook even
in a sluggish economy. Eli Lilly gained 1| to 81; Bristol-Myers
Squibb 1~ to 63\; Abbott Laboratories | to 40~, and Pfizer 1 to 63&rsqb;.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up 1\ at 118; Exxon, up 1 at 48; Procter &amp;
Gamble, up 1{ at 83}, and General Electric, up &lsqb; at 69&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $20.96 billion, or
0.62 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.40 to 193.87.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.53 to 413.78, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.08 at 355.14.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.51 to 456.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 357.05, up .25.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted higher in quiet trading
Wednesday as the markets ignored a report that showed the economy
may be strengthening, traders said.
   Gold prices firmed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for June delivery closed at $351.40 a troy ounce, up $1.
Later, Republic National Bank in New York quoted a troy ounce of
gold at $350.10, unchanged, as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Currency traders said that there was little activity in the
market, and that the dollar moved in a tight range.
   The market had little reaction to the Commerce Department's
report that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead, rose to 0.8
percent in May to a record high.
   News of increasing economic activity normally is good for the
dollar, but ``a market that's bearish on the dollar ignores good
news,'' said John McCarthy, chief currency dealer for Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   President Bush's comment Tuesday that he may accept a tax
increase to reach a budget accord set the tone for the market,
McCarthy said. An accord that cuts the federal deficit could lead
to lower interest rates, which tend to devalue the dollar relative
to other currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.35 Japanese yen, down from
155.23. In London, the dollar also traded at 154.35. In New York,
one dollar bought 154.40 yen, down from 154.55 late Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7430, more expensive for
buyers than Tuesday's $1.7360. In New York, the pound traded at
$1.7428, cheaper than $1.7430 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late quotes, included: 1.6637 West German marks, up from 1.6618;
1.4095 Swiss francs, up from 1.3975; 5.5910 French francs, up from
5.5770; 1,221.50 Italian lire, up from 1,217.50; and 1.1695
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1719.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.6635 West German marks, down from 1.6690;
1.4075 Swiss francs, up from 1.4025; 5.5885 French francs, down
from 5.6035; 1.8700 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8790; 1,219.50
Italian lire, down from 1,222.25; and 1.1705 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1730.
   Gold traded in a narrow range in Europe. Dealers said there was
no investor interest and most participants were squaring up their
positions for end-of-the-month accounting.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $350.05 a troy ounce, up
from $349.50 late Tuesday, and in Zurich at $349.90 bid, down from
$350.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $350.55 bid, down from
$353.25.
   Silver bullion closed in London at a bid $4.84 a troy ounce, up
from $4.79.
   In New York trading, silver for June delivery closed at $4.794 a
troy ounce on the Comex, down from $4.820 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Surge On Production Deficit Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices bounced sharply higher Wednesday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange after the Agriculture
Department predicted world sugar consumption would outstrip
production for the sixth straight year.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; grains and
soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat were mixed; and precious
metals were mixed.
   Sugar futures settled .20 cent to .28 cent higher in New York
with the contract for delivery in July at 12.66 cents a pound.
   The surge followed the release Wednesday morning of a USDA
report pegging world sugar production at 107.2 million metric tons
and consumption at 109.5 million metric tons for the marketing year
beginning Sept. 1.
   Harry Schwartz, a sugar analyst with Cargill Investor Services
Inc., said the heavy buying of sugar futures may have had less to
do with the USDA report than with the market's 23 percent decline
from prices near 16 cents a pound over the past two months.
   ``Sugar is on sale,'' he said. ``This is a limited-time-only,
get-it-while-it's-cheap type of sugar sale.''
   Sugar futures generally have been sinking since early May,
following forecasts by private trade houses for shrinking
consumption and rising production.
   The recent decline was helped by statements from the Soviet
Union indicating it could not afford to buy more sugar, cocoa and
other commodities on the world market.
   But with the recent sharp drop in sugar prices, speculation is
mounting that the Soviets might find the money to make some
purchases, Schwartz said.
   Energy futures prices continued their downward drift on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, led by a steep slide in wholesale
gasoline prices.
   Weekly statistics released late Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute indicated gas demand is running about 5 percent
behind last year.
   Jim Fiedler, an energy specialist for E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said the selloff in gasoline was the catalyst for the
market's overall weakness. He said brokers are puzzled because gas
demand is still lagging despite the start of the peak summer
driving season.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 46 cents
lower with August at $16.68 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent to
.56 cent lower with July at 47.93 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .70 cent 1.83 cents lower with July at 59.49 cents a gallon.
   Near-term pork belly futures soared the permitted daily limit of
2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, largely in
reaction to a weekly exchange report that showed an unexpectedly
large drop of 4 million pounds in supplies of bellies stored in
warehouses outside Chicago.
   Hog futures were supported by stronger cash markets; cattle
futures ended mixed.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .23 cent higher with August at
73.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent lower
with August at 84.20 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .35
cent higher with August at 58.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.42 cents to 2 cents higher with July at 59.15 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a late wave of profit-taking erased strong
midday gains in the corn and soybean markets.
   Susan Leighty, a grain analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the net outcome _ little change in prices _ reflected
traders' reluctance to establish new positions ahead of Thursday's
Agriculture Department report on planted acreage and grain stocks.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with July at
$3.33\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with July
at $2.87 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\ cents lower with July
at $1.36\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with
July at $6.08 a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 20 cents
to $1 higher with June at $351.40 a troy ounce; silver was 2.6
cents to 3 cents lower with July at $4.795 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Merger Activity Continues To Fall in First Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merger activity fell sharply in the first half
of the year as the takeover business continued to contract because
of the scarcity of financing, according to statistics released
Wednesday.
   Securities Data Corp., a financial research firm, reported 2,110
transactions involving U.S. firms worth a total of $88.2 billion
during the first six months to date, down 50 percent in value from
the 2,420 deals worth $193 billion in the first half of 1989.
   The figures reflect not only less activity, but also lower
prices for companies. Since the collapse of the junk bond market
last fall, money to finance deals has been harder to come by, and
prices for businesses have consequently declined.
   The first-half total includes Philip Morris Cos.' planned
purchase of the Swiss candy maker Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion.
   Securities Data reported that global merger activity was also
down during the first half. The company reported 3,736 transactions
with a total value of $187.7 billion, down 39 percent from 4,330
deals worth $305.4 billion a year earlier.
   There was, however, a slight increase in cross-border
transactions _ those involving a foreign company and a U.S.
company. Securities Data said cross-border deals rose by 2 percent
to $29 billion from $28.5 billion.
   In compiling its figures, Securities Data considered
transactions including mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, share
repurchases and self-tenders, minority stake purchases and
leveraged recapitalizations.

<HEAD>Government Accepts Private Bid for Bankrupt Mine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has accepted a bid from a
consortium of Mexican, West German and Canadian investors to buy
the bankrupt Cananea copper mine for $468 million, barely half the
original asking price.
   The consortium, Cuprifera Cananea, submitted the only qualified
bid Monday for the mine and mill in Cananea, Sonora, about 100
miles southeast of Tuscon, Ariz.
   The open pit mine, operated since 1760, is the largest in Mexico
producing 45 percent of the country's output. Mexico is the third
largest copper producer in the world, accounting for 3 percent of
global production.
   The consortium's offer was just above the government-mandated
minimum of $450 million and was just over half the $910 million
value that the government placed on the mine when it first
attempted to sell it in 1988.
   In addition to the purchase price, the consortium will assume
the mine's $700 million in debts.
   Bankruptcy judge Sergio Higueras disqualified a $600 million bid
from the Mexican company Sintemex because the company's
representative showed up three minutes after bidding closed and did
not present the required letter of credit or $45 million security
deposit.
   The judge must decide whether Cuprifera's bid is qualified
within 10 days before the government can turn over its shares to
the consortium, which is led by Mexican tycoon Bernardo Quintana.
   The government took over the mine from Anaconda Copper Mining
Co. under the Mining Law of 1961, which nationalized the industry.
It first put the mine on the selling block two years ago as part of
a move to privatize state industries.
   When 3,000 union miners threatened to strike last August over
contract demands, the government declared bankruptcy and sent in
army troops to close down the mine.
   Two months later, the union accepted a new contract that
eliminated 200 union jobs and reopened the mine.
   The partners of Cuprifera Cananea are the West German metal
company Metallgesellschaft and the German bank West Deutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale; Teck Corp., a Canadian energy and mining
company, and the Mexican development company Ingenieros Civiles
Asociados, or Grupo ICA. Quintana is chairman of ICA.

<HEAD>Regulators Form Task Force To Ensure Recovery From Drexel Of S&amp;L
Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators formed a legal task force Wednesday
to seek compensation for taxpayers from bankrupt Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group for junk bond losses suffered by failed savings and
loans.
   Alfred Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said the agency has preliminary information linking Drexel
and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, to millions of
dollars lost by a number of failed thrifts in junk bonds.
   The FDIC, which insures bank and thrift deposits, and the
Resolution Trust Corp., responsible for closing or merging hundreds
of failed thrifts, may be Drexel's largest creditors, he said.
   ``We intend to recover the maximum amount possible for our
insurance funds and, ultimately, for the American taxpayer,'' Byrne
said. He declined to estimate the amount of the losses and the
number of S&amp;Ls involved.
   The task force, headed by FDIC deputy general counsel Jack
Smith, will consist of 10 to 12 attorneys from the FDIC and RTC. It
is aiming for a share of the $350 million set aside by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for claimants of Drexel and the
$400 million set aside for claimants of Milken.
   Drexel, which sold investors billions of dollars worth of the
risky, high-interest debt securities known as junk bonds, sought
bankruptcy protection in federal court in New York in February. A
judge scheduled Nov. 15 as the deadline for bringing claims against
the firm.
   Smith said regulators may bring one consolidated claim on behalf
of the insurance fund or coordinate the filing of separate claims
for each insolvent institution involved.
   The FDIC-RTC legal group also will be considering possible
criminal referrals to the Justice Department concerning Milken and
Drexel.
   For at least two years, federal banking regulators have been
investigating deals between Drexel's junk bond operation in Beverly
Hills, Calif., and a ``daisy chain'' of thrifts that traded the
bonds among themselves in an alleged scheme to inflate their assets.
   Among the institutions involved are Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, Irvine, Calif., perhaps the nation's costliest thrift
failure with an estimated bailout expense of $2 billion, and
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, Denver, where
President Bush's son, Neil, served on the board of directors.
   The failures of Lincoln and other institutions since early last
year has left the RTC with a $4 billion portfolio of junk bonds to
sell.
   Ken Lerer, a spokesman for Milken, had no comment on the FDIC
announcement. Steven Anreder, a spokesman for Drexel, said: ``As
with any other party, (the regulators) will have to present a
provable claim. It will be up to the courts to determine its
validity.''
   Meanwhile, a group of Democratic House members proposed creation
of a special House committee to investigate the scandal.
   ``When Congress appropriates money, it expects the executive
branch to manage the programs so that taxpayers' money will
be...not lost through incompetence or stolen by crooks,'' said Rep.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   However, House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he didn't see
the need to gear up another bureaucracy on Capitol Hill.
   ``I think the committees of Congress presently authorized can
make the necessary inquiries,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Bell Atlantic, Spain's Telefonica Win Phone Bids</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version ran on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Telefonica of Spain reportedly submitted winning bids for control
of Argentina's state telephone company.
   The sales are critical to Argentina's attempt to sell many of
its money-losing state companies, which employ tens of thousands of
workers but are criticized for chronic inefficiences.
   The sales also have been designed to pare the country's foreign
debt. Argentina is the third most-indebted country in the
developing world behind Mexico and Brazil.
   Bids for ENTel, notorious for its poor telephone service and
money-losing operations, were opened by the government Monday and
will be announced formally on Thursday. The company is being
auctioned off in two sections, serving the northern and southern
parts of the country.
   The Public Works Ministry on Tuesday confirmed newspaper reports
that Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled telecommunications
monopoly, submitted the highest bids for both sections of ENTel.
   But the bidding rules do not allow one company to control both
sections, and Telefonica chose the southern section.
Philadephia-based Bell Atlantic reportedly was allowed to raise its
bid slightly and won control of the northern section.
   Both sections split the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, home to
nearly one-third of Argentina's 32 million residents.
   President Carlos Menem, in power since last July, has endorsed
privatizations as a way to prove Argentina is serious about
righting its economic situation. But his powerful labor-based
Peronist party has balked at the moves, saying too many state
workers would lose their jobs.
   Telefonica director Enrique Used Aznar was quoted as telling the
newspaper La Nacion that his company chose the southern sector
because ``we think it has greater potential to develop our plans of
investment and expansion.''
   Bell Atlantic's representative in Argentina, Carlos Joost
Newbery, was quoted by La Nacion as saying his company increased
its offer for the northern section above Telefonica's to win the
bid. Bell Atlantic's initial offer exceeded that of another bidder,
STET of Italy.
   In all, ownership of 60 percent of ENTel (Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones) was sold for $214 million in cash and $379
million to be paid over six years.
   The winning bidders also will buy $5 billion in Argentina's
long-term bank debt and overdue interest payments, erasing a
sizable chunk of the country's $62 billion debt burden.
   Argentina's debt has been trading at a fraction of its face
value on the open market. The cost to Bell Atlantic and Telefonica
of retiring the debt has been estimated at somewhat over $500
million.
   Ten percent of the new companies will be sold to employees and
the remaining 30 percent will be sold to the public via the Buenos
Aires Stock Exchange.
   Public Works Minister Jose Dromi said the companies are to be
privatized formally on Oct. 8.

<HEAD>Housing Proposal Erupts Into S&amp;L Fairness Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A debate on the alleged unfairness of the
savings and loan bailout toward taxpayers in the Northeast erupted
on the Senate floor Wednesday.
   The clash was the first of what some senators warned could
become an increasingly ugly, regional conflict that could spread
from the thrift bailout to such other issues as housing,
agriculture or defense spending.
   In the midst of a seemingly unrelated debate on housing
legislation, northeastern lawmakers sparred with Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, over reports that states like Connecticut, New York and
Massachusetts will bear the heaviest burden in cleaning up the
financial mess in the Southwest.
   Gramm touched off the debate with an amendment to change the
formula for community development block grants in favor of Sunbelt
states where population is growing rapidly.
   The proposal immediately was challenged by lawmakers who
brandished the S&amp;L collapse as evidence that the Northeast already
is carrying too much baggage for Texas and other southern states.
   ``This amendment has the possibilities of creating enormous
regional animosities, of tearing us apart at a time when we need to
be coming together,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   The Senate voted to kill Gramm's proposal, but not before it
triggered a strong reaction from Northern senators of both parties.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., proposed a counter-amendment that
would ensure recipients of bailout money such as Texas would lose a
proportional amount of block grant funding.
   D'Amato said Congress approved the bailout of the collapsed
savings and loan industry last year even though most of the money
would go to a few southwestern states _ most prominently Texas. But
with Gramm's housing amendment, he said, the rules have changed.
   ``The citizens of New York will pay taxes to clean up the
problems elsewhere and be deprived of the economic use of those
funds,'' D'Amato said. ``Worse still, the empty office space and
cheap homes built with S&amp;L money can be used to lure businesses
away from New York, away from Connecticut.''
   Gramm shot back that the S&amp;L bailout money wasn't being poured
into the coffers of the state of Texas or its citizens _ it was
paying back insured depositors, many of them high-roller investors
from the Northeast.
   He called the idea of using ``trumped up amendments based on the
S&amp;L bailout'' a ``cute and clever'' tactic.
   ``To in any way equate the S&amp;L bailout with a formula for
allocating community development block grant funds, a formula that
in its current incarnation is absolutely unfair, is just
outrageous,'' Gramm said. ``I'm not trying to beat a regional horse
here.''
   D'Amato admitted his amendment was more of a symbolic gesture
than a serious effort at legislation. But D'Amato and others said
the idea of penalizing the Southwest reflected a genuine outrage
over the S&amp;L burden it was placing on the rest of the country.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., cited statistics showing the extent to
which northeastern and midwestern taxpayers will be funneling money
to the Southwest.
   ``Texas, Texas, Texas,'' Dixon bellowed. ``The big winner.''
   Kerry spoke ominously of a farm bill, about to come to the
Senate floor, ``with goodies galore'' for western and southern farm
states. If Gramm and others move to tilt other federal programs in
favor of the Sunbelt, Kerry said, ``the repercussions are going to
play out as we debate the farm bill.''
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., threatened to block a
water resources development bill containing a substantial amount of
money for Texas. Moynihan chairs a Senate subcommittee handling the
bill.

   The West German economics minister on
Wednesday urged foreign companies to invest in East Germany, saying
they would find a stable market and a ``bridge to East Europe.''
   Helmut Haussmann made his statements at a meeting of the
International Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg as the giant West
German electronics firm, Siemens, announced it would invest $600
million in East Germany over the next three years.
   Meanwhile, West Germany said the last of the borders between the
two Germanies would fall Sunday, the day the two countries merge
their economies and East Germany sheds 40 years of socialism for
free-market rules.
   Full political union is now expected after all-German elections,
suggested for early December. The Germanys, after completing the
treaty on economic merger, are now working on one that would iron
out the consitutional issues.
   Some experts say up to 4 million people could lose their jobs in
East Germany as industries once supported by the state fail in the
open market. More than one-third of businesses are expected to
close.
   An influx of Western industry and goods could help offset the
falling standard of living, experts have said.
   Haussmann said he hoped the United States, Japan and all of
Europe would discover East Germany, which he said offered secure
market conditions and a stable currency.
   Western companies have been reluctant to invest in East Germany
during the current political upheaval and transition to a market
economy.
   East German Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl, also at the Hamburg
meeting, said that of the 2,000 joint venture agreements East
Germany had signed so far with Western companies, less than 5
percent were with non-West German companies.
   In arguing for investment in East Germany, Haussmann said the
country would be a member of both the European Economic Community
and Comecon, East Europe's economic equivalent.
   ``East Germany is the bridge between the EC and Comecon,''
Haussmann said. ``Make use of that bridge. If you come too late,
you will miss out.''
   Much of Eastern Europe has opened to new investment following
last year's rejection of repressive Communist rule and subsequent
democratic reforms.
   The announcement by Siemens would represent the biggest single
investment since East Germany implemented its reforms. The company
said it would have up to 30,000 employees in what is now East
Germany within several years.
   Siemens manufacturers computers, telecommunications equipment,
household appliances and other products. The company said its East
German projects would be in communications, data processing, energy
and transportation technology, plant automation, medical technology
and environmental protection.
   The investment includes previously announced joint ventures with
11 former government enterprises and a contract to upgrade East
Germany's poor telephone system in six major cities.
   Siemens spokesman Eberhard Posner said most new employees would
be East Germans _ half newly hired and the rest from existing East
German companies.
   In another step toward unification, the Bonn government said
that on Sunday for the first time Germans would be able to travel
from East to West without border controls.
   In Bonn, government spokesman Hans Klein said West German
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and his East German
counterpart Peter-Michael Diestel would meet along the border
between East Germany and Bavaria on Sunday to sign an agreement
eliminating all frontier controls.

<TEXT>
   South Korea has boosted its economic
growth target for this year to 8 percent to 9 percent, up sharply
from 6.5 percent previously, a government plan said Wednesday.
   The new target compares with actual growth of 6.7 percent last
year when exports, the engine of South Korea's economic growth,
were sluggish.
   The country's economy grew at an annual average rate of 12.7
percent between 1986 and 1988, when exports jumped by more than 20
percent annually.
   The new goal was contained in the economic plan for the second
half of this year that was adopted Tuesday in a meeting of economic
ministers.
   Officials at the Economic Planning Board said the upward
revision was prompted by a better-than-expected economic
performance in the first half and an anticipated export recovery in
the latter half.
   The plan said the gross national product was estimated to have
grown at a rate of 9.2 percent in the first half, mainly spurred by
strong private consumption and booming construction business.
   According to the plan, South Korea is expected to post a current
account deficit of $1 billion this year, its first shortfall in
five years. The government previously had projected a surplus of $2
billion for the year.
   Officials said the economic management plan calls for holding
down annual price inflation to 9 percent by cooling down overheated
domestic consumption and curbing hotel, leisure and other
unnecessary construction projects.
   Korean consumer prices have gone up an estimated 7 percent so
far this year, fueled by excessive demands for construction
materials connected with a boom in real estate and excessive
private consumption.
   The annual inflation rate stood at 5.7 percent last year and
averagd 3.8 percent in the preceding seven years. A government
think tank predicted two weeks ago that prices would rise 13
percent this year.
   The government plans to peg this year's total money supply
growth at 19 percent to contain inflation, officials said.

   A former vice president of the failed Midwest
Federal Savings and Loan was charged Wednesday with violating
federal regulations in arranging a loan to the co-owner of a Miami
resort.
   The indictment accuses Susan Greenwood Olson, who also is the
daughter of Midwest Federal's chairman, of concealing the nature of
her relationship with the co-owner of the beachfront Jockey Club
when she arranged loans for him and the club.
   The indictment did not describe the nature of the alleged
relationship with Howard M. Lorber and prosecutors refused to
comment beyond the indictment.
   The new charges coincided with the appearance of former Chairman
Harold W. Greenwood Jr. in federal court to face separate charges
in the thrift's 1989 collapse. Greenwood and three former top
executives were charged Tuesday with hiding the thrift's losses.
   The cost to the government of selling or liquidating Midwest
Federal is expected to be about $1 billion.
   Ms. Olson was indicted in March on fraud charges involving $15
million in loans to the Jockey Club.
   Prosecutors amended that indictment Wednesday to charge Ms.
Olson with concealing ``the true nature of her relationship with
Howard M. Lorber during the same time frame she arranged for
Midwest Federal to make over $5.4 million in unsafe and unsecured
loans to the Jockey Club in which Howard M. Lorber owned a sizeable
interest.''
   ``I do not know what the language of that count means,'' said
Olson's attorney, Mark Erickson. ``It's just another count. Why
they put it in now, I don't know.''
   The March indictment charged that Ms. Olson obtained an inflated
appraisal of the Jockey Club to justify excess loans. The club,
which owed Midwest Federal $23.5 million in February 1989, was sold
a year ago for about $2.8 million.
   The revised indictment adds Robert A. Mampel, Greenwood's former
executive assistant, as a co-defendant.
   The indictment said Ms. Olson also arranged a $400,000 unsecured
personal loan for Lorber and an unsecured credit line of $50,000.
She was charged with hiding the ``clear and direct conflict of
interest.''
   Lorber could not be reached immediately for comment. Ms. Olson
said she is innocent and will fight the charges.
   ``I don't have anything to be ashamed of,'' she said. ``I'm a
very typical middle-class person and I've abided by the laws.
   ``I'm not a criminal,'' she said. ``I'm going to fight it out.
I'm doing OK. He's (Greenwood) prepared to fight it out as well.''
   Mampel also was charged Tuesday with Greenwood. Mampel's lawyer,
Earl Gray, said he did not know why prosecutors decided to charge
Mampel in separate indictments.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Hank Shea declined to elaborate on the
charges against Mampel.
   Greenwood and former Managing Officer Charlotte E. Masica
appeared briefly before U.S. Magistrate J. Earl Cudd. Mampel
appeared in an adjacent room before U.S. Magistrate Floyd Boline.
   Their next court appearances were set for July 3.
   A summons has been issued for a fourth former executive, Donald
J. Snede, the thrift's former chief financial officer. Snede is
scheduled to make his first court appearance July 11.
   Gray said Snede may be cooperating with prosecutors in an
attempt to work out a plea bargain. Shea did not comment and Snede
did not return a message left on his answering machine at his home.
   Neither Greenwood nor Ms. Masica talked openly during brief
court appearances. Greenwood fidgeted with his hands and
occasionally whispered to his attorney. No pleas were entered.
   Greenwood is accused of withdrawing $2.5 million from his
personal accounts at Midwest Federal within two weeks of the
government takeover. Federal deposit insurance covers only the
first $100,000 in personal accounts.

   A new truck drivers group is asking
other truckers to stay off the roads in the United States and
Canada from July 1 through July 4 to protest poor pay and working
conditions, organizers of the proposed shutdown said Wednesday.
   If the ``truckers' holiday'' is successful, food products will
be in short supply at grocery stores by July 5, said Herman Johns,
president of the United Truckers Alliance. And if their demands for
better pay and working conditions are ignored, the Belleville-based
group wants truckers to stay out until they are met.
   ``We are losing our professional drivers because they can't
afford to keep driving. They must work 90 to 100 hours a week,''
said Cecilia ``CeCe'' Nebgen, vice president of UTA, which was
formed in February.
   The group, which says it represents 3,000 truckers, said that 1
million of the estimated 2.7 million over-the-road truck drivers
are expected to join the effort.
   That figure was scoffed at by Don Tepper, spokesman for the
National Private Truck Council in Alexandria, Va. The council
represents shippers, producers and truck carrier companies
nationwide.
   ``If they expect 1 million drivers to join them, then Santa
Claus would be leading the way,'' Tepper said, noting that similar
calls by other groups in the early 1980s were unsuccessful.
   But he conceded that a successful four-day stoppage could leave
store shelves understocked or bare.
   Meanwhile, in a separate action, Canadian truck drivers were
preparing to park their rigs at border crossings at midnight
Thursday to protest government policies in their country that they
believe are unfair to Canadian truckers.
   Wayne Whitney, a Windsor, Ont., driver who heads a group called
Canadian Truckers Fighting Back, said Wednesday in the Canadian
capital of Ottawa that his group is asking drivers not to cross the
border.
   Several border points in Ontario and Quebec were shutdown
earlier this month by drivers who say they are being forced out of
business by U.S. trucking companies.
   Johns said members of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, which represents about 15 percent of truck drivers, were
expected to join next week's protest. Teamsters officials in
Washington did not return repeated phone calls for comment.
   Half the membership of the UTA, formed in February, is comprised
of independent drivers and the other half work for shipping or
other companies, Johns said. Tepper said about 150,000 of the
nation's truck drivers are independent, or so-called
owner-operators.
   Johns said truckers are being driven out of the industry by
increases in operation costs and decreasing paychecks.
   ``Truckers haven't had a pay raise in 10 years, since
deregulation took effect,'' he said, referring to congressional
action that eased restrictions on the trucking industry in 1980.
   Tepper conceded pay is low for some drivers.
   ``Some owner-operators are making a nice living and there are
other operators who are earning very little. But it's a measurable
minority,'' he said.
   Johns said the alliance wants all truck carriers and companies
that ship goods by truck to:
   _Pay company drivers 32 cents per mile and $16 per hour for all
time spent driving, fueling, loading, unloading and working around
the truck. Company drivers are now paid about 20 cents per mile and
no hourly wage, Johns said. Tepper said they make between 20 and 25
cents per mile.
   _Pay independent drivers $1 per mile for the use of their
tractor, an additional 20 cents per mile if the trailer is supplied
by the owner-operator and $16 per hour labor. Johns said
independents currently make about 80 cents per mile.
   Tepper doubted truckers would win their demands.
   ``With the competition in the marketplace and with the number of
drivers that there are, those wage and compensation levels couldn't
be justified,'' Tepper said. ``There are people willing to work for
less.''
   Several drivers a truck stop in Troy, in Southern Illinois, said
they planned to join the stoppage.
   ``Yeah, I plan to stay home'' Greenville, Pa., driver Dennis
Bowman said. ``When you look at a paycheck of $500 and you're
working 110 hours a week, it doesn't make much sense.''
   But Chicago trucker Ronald Thomas said, ``I don't believe in
shutdowns. I don't think it does any good.''

<HEAD>Company Recalls Blood Pressure Drug</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Also on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York drug company Wednesday began
recalling a generic drug used to treat high blood pressure after
the Food and Drug Administration alleged the company submitted
false information to the agency.
   Interpharm Inc. of Plainview, N.Y., agreed to recall all three
strengths of clonidine hydrochloride tablets from distributors and
pharmacies and to conduct an audit of its 24 other products, the
FDA said.
   The drug comes in small, round, blue tablets marked ``IP 47.''
   Routine testing by the FDA found that ``samples of clonidine
hydrochloride 0.3 milligram tablets submitted for bioequivalence
testing by Interpharm were not the same as the product on the
market,'' the agency said.
   The tablets Interpharm was marketing were blue, and in its
application for approval the company told the FDA its tablets were
blue. But the pills that were tested for bioequivalence before the
drug was approved were peach-colored, the FDA said.
   The agency said it found no manufacturing or production data
that indicated the company had ever made any peach-colored pills.
   The FDA said it had no evidence of a safety problem with the
drug Interpharm was marketing, but questions whether the product is
therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug, Catapres, made
by Boehringer Ingelheim.
   FDA officials advised patients who use the product to consult
with their physician about switching to another product.
   Interpharm was one of 20 generic drug companies selected for
intensified inspections last year in the wake of allegations that
several companies had falsified documents and cheated on tests
needed to win FDA approval.
   The investigation that resulted has produced more than a dozen
criminal convictions. More than 100 drugs have been recalled or
withdrawn.

<HEAD>State Sues Accountant Who Backed Lincoln Junk Bond Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of California sued deposed S&amp;L boss
Charles H. Keating Jr. and his accounting firm Wednesday in an
effort to recover $250 million lost on junk bonds sold through
Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp contended that Arthur Young &amp;
Co.'s audit of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental
Corp., deceived the public about the safety of the company.
   Phoenix-based American Continental issued the high-yield,
high-risk bonds, which were sold primarily to elderly investors at
branches of Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln.
   ``If investors had known the truth, no one would have invested a
dime in those bonds. Keating and company would have been laughed
out of the market,'' Van de Kamp said at a news conference. ``But
with Arthur Young standing behind them, their bonds sold easily.''
   The bonds became worthless when American Continental filed for
bankruptcy protection in April 1989.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln the next day. They say it may
cost taxpayers $2 billion to cover the thrift's losses.
   Van de Kamp's unfair business practices suit contends Arthur
Young and its former partner who audited American Continental, Jack
Atchison, should have known the company was losing huge sums of
money.
   Instead, Van de Kamp said, the accountants vouched for a
``glowing prospectus'' that said American Continental was
profitable and a good risk.
   The state's lawsuit follows the lead of class-action suits
already filed on behalf of the more than 20,000 bondholders, which
name as defendants accountants and lawyers for American Continental
and Keating.
   ``You go after the people who were paid by Keating,'' said John
D.K. Brunner, the chairman of a committee of the bondholders.
   ``Keating has very skillfully planned to hide behind his Chapter
11 (bankruptcy filing), but for those people who profited very
heavily by him and did his bid and calling _ the lawyers,
accountants and all those _ that's the only chance us bondholders
will ever have of getting our money back.''
   California's lawsuit, filed in state court in Orange County,
seeks to recover $250 million from Arthur Young, Atchison, Keating,
American Continental and other company officials.
   It also seeks penalties of more than $50 million and an
injunction to stop Arthur Young from engaging in alleged deceptive
audits of thrifts.
   Atchison could not be located for comment. Earlier this year he
invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination
and declined to testify in a hearing on Keating's lawsuit
attempting to reclaim control of Lincoln.
   Arthur Young now does business as Ernst &amp; Young. Its associate
general counsel, Eugene Erbstoesser, said he had not seen the
lawsuit. But he denied any wrongdoing and said the firm had
conformed to all applicable accounting standards.
   Keating's attorney, James Ham, accused Van de Kamp of wasting
money on lawsuits that can recover no money from his client, who he
said is broke.
   Van de Kamp said Arthur Young should have detected what he said
were American Continental's fraudulent misrepresentations.
   Last August, regulators who seized Lincoln released a report by
an outside accounting firm, Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., whom they had
hired to assess Keating's accounting practices.
   Leventhal concluded American Continental used accounting
``gimmickry'' to inflate its profits.
   Keating's activities are the targets of several criminal probes
and federal investigations, and a securities fraud suit by
California's Department of Corporations.
   Van de Kamp said Keating and his associates at American
Continental ``were running a huge financial con game, and sucking
the assets out of Lincoln Savings to sustain their operations.''
   Atchison was later hired by American Continental at a salary of
$900,000 a year _ four times what he was making at Arthur Young.
   ``It takes no great insight to understand why he was worth that
princely sum to ACC,'' Van de Kamp said.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Higher, Share Prices Lose Moderately in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher against the Japanese
yen in early trading Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange declined moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 154.57 yen, up 0.22 yen from
Wednesday's close. It finished at 154.40 yen in New York overnight,
down from 154.55 yen late Tuesday.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar's
firmness followed dollar buying in the Sydney market, which opened
earlier than Tokyo's.
   ``But the dollar will not move in a one-sided direction today
because of a lack of fresh incentives'' to affect exchange rates,
Kuroda said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 177.41 points, or 0.54 percent, to move to 32,135.34 in
the first 15 minutes of trading. The index gained 740.98 points
Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slipped to 87.03, down from Wednesday's
close of 87.05. The yield stood at 7.18 percent, up from the
previous day's 7.175 percent.

<HEAD>Senate Revamps Housing Programs, Raises Price of FHA Mortgages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Senate passage of bill and
later debate. Also moved on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved overhauling
federal housing policies and requiring first-time home buyers to
pay more for FHA-backed mortgages.
   The bill, which had languished on the Senate floor for nearly
two weeks, was approved on a 96-1 vote after Democrats and
Republicans announced agreement on key provisions with the Bush
administration. The only no vote was cast by Sen. William Roth,
R-Del.
   As passed, the legislation would authorize $18.1 billion in
federal spending on housing in fiscal 1991, $19.5 billion in 1992
and $21 billion in 1993, compared with the $14.5 billion being
spent this year.
   The issue now movesto the House, where a competing version would
cost far more money and take a different approach to restructuring
often scandal-prone federal housing programs that have basically
gone unchanged since 1968.
   ``Many problems still face us dealing with the conference'' with
House members over their bill, said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
But he called the compromise and Senate vote ``an important
breakthrough that could assure passage of a major housing bill this
year.''
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp joined Senate
sponsors, including D'Amato and Cranston, in announcing agreement
on key elements of the bill.
   The administration agreed to authorize spending some $3 billion
more on federal housing programs next year than President Bush
sought in his proposed budget for fiscal 1991.
   In return, the administration's so-called Homeownership
Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) program to encourage
eventual tenant purchase of public housing units, was included with
$1.9 billion over three years.
   Senate Democrats also agreed to accept Kemp's proposals to make
home buyers using FHA mortgages ante up more of their own money at
the point of sale as a measure for shoring up the financially
imperiled program.
   Under the changes, new home buyers with FHA-backed loans would
have to make at least a 5 percent down payment on the purchase
price and cover at least two-thirds of the closing costs out of
their own pockets without financing.
   Loans with low down payments, deemed most at risk to default,
would also be subject to an added annual fee.
   The administration, in turn, gave Senate Democrats the Housing
Opportunity Program (HOP) which would consolidate 10 existing
housing programs for sending money to local governments to renovate
or build new housing for low-income families.
   Democrats agreed to accept provisions that would allow a portion
of the money to be spent on vouchers for the poor to use for rental
housing, despite the Senate's rejection of a similar proposal last
week.
   The Senate passed the bill after spending much of the day using
it as a vehicle to argue about which regions of the country were
having to spend the most on the savings and loan bailout.
   The final hour was spent on debating an amendment by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., directing negotiators working on a deficit reduction
package to cut a wide variety of federal programs and subsidies
before raising taxes. President Bush on Tuesday said a tax increase
is needed in addition to spending cuts.
   Helms' amendment was later accepted on a voice vote after it was
watered down to say that the negotiators should consider the most
feasible budget reduction proposals from a wide variety of groups
before considering new or increased taxes.
   Earlier, rancorous debate centered on a proposal by Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, to shift community development subsidies in the
housing bill from the Northeast to Texas and 35 other states, many
in the Sun Belt. His amendment would have changed distribution
formula for the $3 billion in block grants to one based solely on
population.
   The Senate voted to table, or kill, Gramm's proposal on a 63-35
vote after it triggered a strong reaction from northern senators
who charged Texas and the Southwest have benefited most from the
massive federal spending on covering S&amp;L losses.
   ``The people of New York are going to pay $17 billion for the
savings and loan bailout,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   ``The state of Texas gets 59 percent of that. ... Why should
every man, woman and child have to pony up money to pay for that?''
D'Amato said.
   He retaliated with an amendment that would reduce community
development grants to states with savings and loans institutions
that have been taken over by the federal government. It died with
Gramm's amendment.
   Gramm's proposal would have replaced a complex formula now in
use that places greater emphasis on the age of existing housing,
population crowding, the number of people in poverty and the rate
of growth.
   ``I'm trying to right a terrible wrong in the allocation of
money,'' Gramm said. ``I don't think New York has any room to cry
... about the allocation of funds. Texas gets cheated by the
current formula,'' he said.
   According to Gramm's figures, New York would suffer a 95 percent
cut in its community development money, from $302 million to $207
million. Other states that would lose money would be Hawaii,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island.
   Texas, Florida and California would be among the biggest
gainers, each getting an increase of more than $20 million.
   Three senators did not vote on final passage of the bill. They
were Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; William Armstrong, R-Colo.; and
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
